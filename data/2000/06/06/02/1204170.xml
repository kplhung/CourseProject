        <p>Conservatives condemned and liberals applauded the court decision today denying Elian Gonzalez an asylum hearing, while the two politicians most prominently seeking support in the political center -- Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas -- temporized.</p>
        <p>Senator Robert C. Smith, Republican of New Hampshire, called it ''a sad judgment and a tragedy for this little boy.''</p>
        <p>Robert W. Edgar, general secretary of the National Council of Churches, said, ''Our only disappointment is that it didn't happen earlier.''</p>
        <p>But neither Mr. Bush nor Mr. Gore would say whether they thought the decision was good or bad. Mr. Gore said that it should be ''respected,'' but that he had always believed a Florida family court should have dealt with the case. Mr. Bush said that he agreed, and that Mr. Gore should now persuade Attorney General Janet Reno to send the case there. Ms. Reno made it clear that she had no such plans, saying, ''I think justice has been done.''</p>
        <p>Each presidential hopeful had reasons for hedging. Conservative Republicans who had demanded an investigation and hearings when Elian, the 6-year-old Cuban boy, was forceably taken from the house of his great-uncle on April 22 quickly retreated when it was clear the public supported the government action.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Gore's split with the administration was widely condemned in his own party as pandering to Cuban-American voters in Florida.</p>
        <p>But there is another level at which the decision defies ideological pigeonholing. While the result disappoints conservatives like Mr. Smith and Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip, it is a statement of judicial restraint, a staple conservative principle.</p>
        <p>At least 11 times, the opinion by  Judge J. L. Edmondson of the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit suggested that the Immigration and Naturalization Service might have made wrong decisions in the case. But, Judge Edmondson wrote, it was not the job of judges to overturn the policy ''selected by the I.N.S. merely because we personally might have chosen another.''</p>
        <p>The opinion, in language that could come from any Republican platform of the last 20 years, concluded: ''It is the duty of the Congress and of the executive branch to exercise political will. Although courts should not be unquestioning, we should respect the other branches' policy making powers. The judicial power is a limited power. It is the duty of the judicial branch not to exercise political will, but only to render judgment under the law.''</p>
        <p>Liberals' pleasure at the result was tempered by just that element of deference, because many important immigration cases challenge deportations, and seek to require courts to oversee I.N.S. decisions to a degree this opinion clearly bars.</p>
        <p>Howard Simon, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida, said the decision was not surprising. ''This,'' Mr. Simon said, ''is the consequence of Congress giving so much discretion to the immigration service and the Department of Justice,'' a degree of discretion the A.C.L.U. found excessive when the 1996 immigration act denied judicial review to aliens the I.N.S. found deportable.</p>
        <p>T. Alexander Aleinikoff, professor of law at the Georgetown University Law School, praised the decision for reaching a proper standard of judicial review of administrative decisions by the executive branch. But Professor Aleinikoff said, ''We seem to always go further in immigration cases where there is an extra dose of deference that is given.''</p>
        <p>He said the court probably went further than this case demanded in emphasizing how immigration policy affected ''the president's conduct of our nation's international affairs.''</p>
        <p>While most of the political reaction today focused on the result of the decision, and not its legal logic, Mr. DeLay cited due process. ''Elian Gonzalez should, at a minimum, have his case for asylum fully heard and objectively considered,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, said, ''The court correctly found that the I.N.S. acted within its discretion in deciding that it is the role of parents to care for and make decisions for their young children in all but the rarest circumstances.''</p>
