        <p>The Federal appeals court ruling yesterday in the Elian Gonzalez case reaffirmed legal principles that give Federal agencies -- and particularly immigration officials -- wide authority.</p>
        <p>The decision by a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit was a clear but somewhat lukewarm endorsement of the Immigration and Naturalization Service's position that only Elian's father -- not the 6-year-old boy himself or his Miami relatives -- could decide whether the boy would seek asylum.</p>
        <p>''Although the courts should not be unquestioning, we should respect the other branches' policy-making powers,'' the decision said. ''The judicial power is a limited power.''</p>
        <p>To experts on family law, the ruling was an endorsement of legal rules that generally declare that, unless they are abusive, parents speak for their children in deciding where and with whom the children live.</p>
        <p>But some immigration lawyers said they were troubled that the court's decision gave the immigration service such wide latitude.</p>
        <p>''Our concern is, this is setting a dangerous precedent for other children'' who might need to seek asylum in this country, said Wendy Young, a lawyer and the director for government relations of the Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children. The group works to increase refugees' asylum and immigration rights internationally.</p>
        <p>''The court,'' Ms. Young said, ''is placing in the hands of the I.N.S. the total discretion of deciding which of those claims it will hear, and which of those claims it won't hear, based on the child's age.''</p>
        <p>The judges suggested that if it had been up to them, they might have made a different decision and considered whether Elian needed asylum from the Marxist Cuban government. But they said they were not permitted to second-guess a decision by immigration officials that fit ''within the range of reasonable choices,'' even if that decision ''worries us some.''</p>
        <p>The three judges who ruled yesterday -- J. L. Edmondson, Joel F. Dubina and Charles R. Wilson -- were the same judges who ruled in April that Elian had to remain in this country while his case was decided.</p>
        <p>Although the decision did little to change existing law, some immigration lawyers said, the judges' hands-off position in such a high-profile case was likely to be taken by immigration officials as a signal that the courts would seldom intervene.</p>
        <p>''The ruling is worrying as a precedent in the sense that there are many cases in which minors -- mostly unaccompanied -- need to claim protection from persecution,'' said Arthur C. Helton, an immigration law expert and a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.</p>
        <p>The Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children said 4,600 unaccompanied children were detained for possible deportation by immigration officials last year.</p>
        <p>An applicant is eligible for asylum under the law if he or she has a ''well-founded fear of persecution'' based on political beliefs or membership in racial, religious, national or social groups.</p>
        <p>In its opinion yesterday the court itself noted that the decision could hurt some children. ''We recognize, that, in some instances, the I.N.S. policy of deferring to parents -- especially those residing outside of this country -- might hinder some 6-year-olds with nonfrivolous asylum claims,'' the opinion said. But, the judges concluded, ''we cannot disturb the I.N.S. policy in this case just because it might be imperfect.''</p>
        <p>Elian's claim for asylum began with an application filed by his great-uncle and later an application filed in the boy's own name. His father subsequently told the immigration officials that he did not want an application for asylum to be considered.</p>
        <p>The boy's Miami relatives argued that it was by definition abusive for his father to insist on returning Elian to Cuba.</p>
        <p>Courts generally defer to the expertise of administrative agencies. But in the area of immigration law, courts have held that the authority of judges is even more limited, because immigration policy is part of foreign relations, where the executive branch is given wide authority.</p>
        <p>Some experts on immigration law said yesterday that they did not share the concerns of some immigration lawyers that the decision yesterday could harm other children.</p>
        <p>David A. Martin, a former general counsel of the immigration service, said it was standard practice for the courts to recognize that immigration officials, not judges, are experts in making decisions about such issues.</p>
        <p>Mr. Martin, who is a law professor at the University of Virginia, said the opinion yesterday was of limited reach because the immigration service conceded that some children could seek asylum even if their parents objected, like when they were threatened with imminent harm.</p>
        <p>''In this case,'' he said, ''it became a question of line drawing: When do you consider the wishes of the parent and when do you consider the child's case independently?''</p>
        <p>Other immigration law experts said that given the facts of Elian's case, it would have been extraordinary for a court to require immigration officials to consider an application filed against his father's wishes.</p>
        <p>There are cases in which courts have gone too far in refusing to review the decision of immigration officials, said Stephen H. Legomsky, a professor of immigration law at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis.</p>
        <p>But, Mr. Legomsky said, ''any court would come out this way in terms of the father having the right to decide for this 6-year old child.''  THE ELIAN GONZALEZ CASE: THE LEGAL ISSUES</p>
