        <p>The cars, some with Puerto Rican flags fluttering from windows, slowed to a crawl yesterday as they passed Tito Puente's, the restaurant on City Island in the Bronx co-owned by the mambo king himself.</p>
        <p>Most simply rolled past, the drivers and occupants looking sadly at the name Tito Puente on the large neon sign and the green-and-white awning. Others went inside, glancing at countless pictures of the famous band leader and percussionist. A few left roses and carnations at the bar, with one follower leaving a handwritten note, ''Tito, you will be missed.''</p>
        <p>While the man known as El Rey, or the King, had millions of fans the world over, across the Bronx and the rest of New York City, where the musical legend was first and foremost known as Tito, he was also seen as much more: A hero for the Puerto Rican community, and a role model for the young. A man who, despite his great success, had never forgotten his roots.</p>
        <p>''He was a superstar, but he was part of the community,'' said Bob Gotay, 48, who spent three hours yesterday afternoon outside Tito Puente's, reminiscing about a man whose music had attracted him since his childhood. ''You knew that every time you saw him, that for one more day the culture was safe and in good hands.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gotay said he and other Bronx residents of Puerto Rican descent who had long followed Mr. Puente's career felt the need to be at the restaurant, where the orchestra leader often dined on filet of sole in plum tomato sauce, gave interviews to reporters and, on occasion, played his music to a rapt crowd.</p>
        <p>''We just wanted to take a look and say goodbye in our own way, take a glance at the sign and maybe connect with him,'' said Mr. Gotay, a Con Edison customer service representative who grew up in the Soundview section of the Bronx. ''It was just a nostalgic thing, come out here, sit a couple of hours and pay homage to a guy who touched my life.''</p>
        <p>Although born in East Harlem, where he began his career playing in neighborhood haunts, Mr. Puente later left an indelible mark in several Manhattan clubs, like the Palladium and La Casa del Mambo, as well as many clubs in the Bronx, said friends and fellow musicians. Through the late 1960's and into the early 1980's, he played at Bronx clubs like Hippo Campo, Colgate Gardens and the Hunts Point Palace. Those who played with him or saw him perform recalled the flamboyance and energy that went into his songs.</p>
        <p>''He was a tremendous influence, not only for the up-and-coming bands, but also for the people who came out dancing, who wanted to have contact,'' said Ramon Rodriguez, director of the Harbor Conservatory for the Performing Arts in East Harlem, a musical school that Mr. Puente often visited. ''This was the only music where people could get close to their superstars, unlike in the American market, where superstars are untouchable.''</p>
        <p>Nicky Marrero, 50, a percussionist and Bronx resident who often performed with Mr. Puente, said the band leader became a ''heartthrob for the salseros here,'' speaking of die-hard dancers who lived for the nights when they could dance to Mr. Puente's music.</p>
        <p>''In the Bronx, wow, you breathe the name Tito Puente and it's like breathing oxygen,'' he said. ''He was like oxygen to us. And he made a lot of people happy.''</p>
        <p>Louis Bauzo, 52, a teacher at the Harbor Conservatory who also played with the Puente orchestra, said Mr. Puente built a following not just with his music but also by making friends and remembering names. ''He was always very accessible to the public,'' Mr. Bauzo said. ''You couldn't just walk down the street with him. You'd have to leave an hour early because he would be stopped constantly.''</p>
        <p>While his popularity would often take him around the world, he often returned to such places as Jimmy's Bronx Cafe on West Fordham Road in the Bronx, a famed restaurant and nightclub, and Willie's Steak House on Westchester Avenue in the Bronx. Year after year, he also played at local venues to raise money for the Tito Puente Scholarship Fund, which gave needy teenagers a shot at college.</p>
        <p>Sherley Ghappour, a waitress for three years at Tito Puente's, said she was always impressed by how Mr. Puente would make small talk with her, treating her the same as he treated well-known musicians and politicians. ''Forget it, he was a beautiful person,'' she said. ''If I ran in, he'd be, like, 'Hi, how are you.' He would kiss me. He was always such a happy person.''</p>

        <p>Mourning in Puerto Rico</p>
        <p>SAN JUAN, P.R., June 1 (AP) -- Puerto Rico embraced Tito Puente as a native son, and on word of his death today, the Caribbean island's government declared three days of official mourning.</p>
        <p>''It hurts all of us,'' said Carlos A. Romero-Barcelo, Puerto Rico's lone delegate to the United States Congress. ''He put Puerto Rico's name in lights.''</p>
        <p>Many artists in Puerto Rico who worked with Mr. Puente over the decades were stunned by his death.</p>
        <p>Nestor Otero, the graphic artist, said Mr. Puente gave Puerto Ricans in the mainland United States and around the world a sense of belonging to a single community.</p>
        <p>Mr. Puente, he said, ''incorporated our music in the international vocabulary.''</p>
