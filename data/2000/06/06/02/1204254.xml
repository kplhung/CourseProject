        <p>In a move that had been anticipated for several weeks, Tiger Woods will use the Nike golf ball on a long-term basis, starting with the United States Open later this month in Pebble Beach, Calif.</p>
        <p>Woods's representatives at IMG announced the change yesterday. After using Titleist golf balls since turning professional, Woods switched to the Nike ball for the first time in competition last month at the SAP-Deutsche Bank Open in Germany. Woods finished third in Germany, and he used the Nike ball again at the Memorial Tournament last weekend, which he won easily by five strokes.</p>

        <p>''I understand the impact I can have, but it really doesn't matter if I'm not swinging the club well,'' Woods said at the Memorial.</p>
        <p>''I need to keep playing solid golf. It's a different ball, but the best time to make a change is when you're playing well.''</p>
