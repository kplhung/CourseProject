        <p>During the economic boom in the 1980's, few things reflected this country's exploding wealth better than its sudden madness for golf.</p>
        <p>In a nation of badly overcrowded cities and itsy-bitsy homes, wide, lush fairways were constructed at such a clip that by the end of the decade there were 2,400 courses, covering an area roughly triple the size of Tokyo itself. Lavish clubhouses included expensive artwork from masters like Chagall and Monet and solid gold fixtures. Bankers and promoters were financing memberships -- for up to $200,000 each -- as investments that they predicted would take off like a well-hit tee shot.</p>
        <p>But the golf club investment craze here ran into trouble when Japan's economic bubble burst 10 years ago. Personal bankruptcies rose, the value of club memberships fell and many courses were immediately in a financial hole.</p>
        <p>Now, at least 1,700 of the country's golf courses are either bankrupt or in financial trouble, according to industry estimates. And the bankers and other lenders who financed the courses and the individual memberships are desperately trying to contain one of the the economy's biggest problems.</p>
        <p>''It is very difficult to exactly calculate the extent of the bad loan problem in this country,'' said Takehito Sasaki, managing director at PricewaterhouseCoopers, Japan. ''Some people estimate it at $1.2 trillion. Maybe 20 percent of that is related to the golf course crisis.''</p>
        <p>Included in that is an estimated $95 billion in non-interest-bearing security deposits on club memberships that are tied up in distressed clubs -- more than the gross domestic product of Ireland or Singapore or New Zealand.</p>
        <p>Large numbers of club memberships are now maturing for the first time, meaning that subscribers may demand reimbursement from the clubs, and many Japanese are realizing for the first time the extent of their losses. In short, the clubs have little or nothing to pay them.</p>
        <p>The crisis over golf course debt comes at a time when Japan is having some success in whittling down other types of unconventional debt, like loans to so-called love hotels, and to Pachinko parlors, both of which were linked to the country's speculative boom in the 1980's.</p>
        <p>Japan's golf crisis is coming to a head right now for reasons that have to do with the Ponzi scheme nature of the business, and the almost lemming-like zeal with which ordinary Japanese ponied up to become players. With the eager encouragement of banks that were lending both to golfers and developers, memberships were sold as investments with the promise that they could be cashed in after 10 years.</p>
        <p>''Our orders were to market financial products, and to find as many customers as possible,'' said one former bank employee. ''We were not encouraged to ask many questions.''</p>
        <p>The slick young agents who were peddling these ''investments,'' were quick to add that it would be foolish to cash in, because the memberships could always be sold to others at a rich profit.</p>
        <p>With Japan's economy looking as if it were enjoying an endless ascent, middle-class people took out loans to ''invest'' in club memberships, which sold anywhere from $50,000 to $200,000, convinced that their memberships would double or triple in value -- as they did for a time -- every two or three years. Typically, the same banks that were lending to golf course developers were promoting loans linked to their clubs, without the slightest disclosure of conflict of interest.</p>
        <p>''Banks were lending as much as 20 million yen to their customers to get them to become members of golf courses,'' said Seijiro Takayama, a lawyer who has represented many people who have lost their fortunes in memberships that have turned worthless, but with little success. ''The banks were not reporting to the investors about the state of the clubs, nor were they inspecting these individuals' finances either.''</p>
        <p>Shuichi Yamashita, an official of the Golf Management Research Institute, a consulting company. said: ''There were cases where really bad people deliberately swindled people. But that is only part of it. This is the failure of people who turned the golf business into a money making machine. There are many companies who saw that this area is very profitable.''</p>
        <p>This kind of misfortune has led to a new boom in at least two sectors: loan collecting, and the protection racket. Mr. Takayama said that Japanese yakuza, or organized crime groups, were offering their services to golf club members who had lost their personal savings in the debacle. Playing the other side of the street too, sometimes simultaneously, the gangsters have also been employed by golf clubs' management to scare members out of filing lawsuits to recover their investments.</p>
        <p>For Mitsuko Fujii, a 64-year-old deputy director of a golf school, who saw club memberships investments as the perfect adjunct to her work, news of the collapse of the Omon Golf Club, in Tochigi prefecture north of Tokyo, one of her five memberships, came in the form of a simple postcard.</p>
        <p>''I bought it in January 1989, and for two years heard nothing from them,'' Ms. Fujii said. ''Then I received a postcard saying that they wanted to explain the condition of the club. Shortly afterward, we learned that the club had already been seized by a financial company in Osaka, and the caddies and instructors had already all been fired.''</p>
        <p>Other clubs have collapsed but have been forced by the courts to allow their members to continue playing until they are ultimately liquidated. And some clubs continue to function more or less normally, with their memberships traded actively, almost like futures, but at steep discounts</p>
        <p>Ms. Fujii paid 9.8 million yen, or $90,740 at current exchange rates, for a membership in the Nishikata Golf Club, a decade ago. And as an early entry into the membership pool, she once thought she had gotten a terrific deal. Others eventually paid three times as much.</p>
        <p>Today, a membership in that club can be picked up for less than $300. And still there are few takers.</p>
        <p>''I think the banks were the most guilty party,'' an angry Ms. Fujii  said. ''There was always some credit company ready to lend money for memberships. They were allied with the golf courses, telling people, anyone can get a loan like this, and if you buy the membership, the price will steadily rise. And many people were tricked.</p>
        <p>''But I also feel responsibility. I listened to the promoters who told me that if you buy something in Japan that is tied to the price of land, it's value will never go down. I listened to these people and my judgment failed.''</p>
