        <p>It was a very warm day in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, and an even warmer day inside the house where the director Bob Gosse was shooting ''Julie Johnson,'' an independent feature that stars Lili Taylor, Courtney Love and Spalding Gray.</p>
        <p>With the windows shrouded with heavy black cloth to simulate night, and about 20 crew members and a dozen extras crammed into a hallway, a kitchen and a dining room, the temperature had soared well beyond sauna standards.</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Gosse, a founding partner of the Shooting Gallery, a production company, and the director of the 1997 film ''Niagara, Niagara,'' was keeping amazingly cool behind the camera. The objective was a complicated tracking shot that followed Donna Hanover, playing the dutiful academic wife to Mr. Gray's physics professor, as she opened the door for Ms. Taylor and Ms. Love, and ushered them into a cocktail party.</p>
        <p>''Do it again, but better'' was Mr. Gosse's half-joking direction as take followed take, each one spoiled by a missed cue or an overstepped mark. But neither Mr. Gosse nor his performers betrayed the slightest hint of discomfort. Sometimes acting is knowing how not to sweat.</p>
        <p>''Julie Johnson,'' adapted from a play by Wendy Hammond, is the story of a Hoboken housewife, played by Ms. Taylor, whose life changes radically when she decides to enroll in a night school class, ''Introduction to Computers.'' ''When Lili's character announces, 'I don't want to be stupid no more,' it kicks off an unraveling that becomes the narrative arc of the picture,'' Mr. Gosse said. Julie discovers not only that she has a genius for advanced mathematics, but also that she's been living a lie. She kicks out her domineering husband and takes up instead with her best friend, Claire (Ms. Love).</p>
        <p>''I grew up on the West Coast with hippies,'' Ms. Love said, ''where if people were gay, they were gay. No big deal. But then a couple of years ago, when I started getting projected more into the mainstream and having to deal with mainstream American values and not really understanding it, I started to meet people who weren't out, who weren't resolved with it, and that's the majority of people who live in this country. And I started to have a lot more compassion for the fact that they can't come out, because it's not that easy.''</p>
        <p>''I went to a Wynona Judd show,'' added Ms. Love, best known as the leader of the rock band Hole. ''And she's, like, married, not a gay person at all. But I went to the show, and there were so many women there I just thought, O.K., this is like the big gay fest for women. I felt this vibe of not-straightness in the room, and yet everybody seemed to have wedding rings and children. Right after that, I read this script.''</p>
        <p>Speakinof Ms. Love, Mr. Gosse said: ''She's whip smart, and she's brought an intelligence to Claire that wasn't apparent in the screenplay. It would be easy to read this script and see Claire in a condescending way, but I didn't want to condescend to either of these women.''</p>
        <p>For Ms. Taylor, too, it was important to avoid the big-hair, pink-sweater, rhinestone-glasses cliches that define New Jersey in so many movies and television shows. ''I see Julie as basically asleep, and then the tension builds and she breaks. This story reminds me of the fairy tale called 'The Handless Maiden,' and for a while I imagined her without hands, as someone incomplete.''</p>
        <p>When she approaches a role, Ms. Taylor said, ''I try to be as blank as possible, and then by reading the script over and over, by the sixth time through things start seeping in, maybe by osmosis. First I have to know what's going on inside the character. I'm more of an inside-out than an outside-in. Some actors work great outside-in, but I feel like I'm wearing a suit and it doesn't quite fit.</p>
        <p>''I find with a good script that I can break the character down into four or five general phases. I usually name each phase, and I write out all the beats in between on a chart. It's especially useful on independents, when it's all over the place and you're moving so quick. Let's say I have seven scenes in one day and I've got to go from phase to phase, so I just look at my little chart and I'm right there.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Love has her own approach.  ''I've been working with the clothes, trying to get it right but totally getting it wrong. I was in the lobby of my hotel and I saw Sofia Coppola and Spike Jonze, and it was the day before the shooting started. I sat down with them and I had a coffee and they both were, like, a hundred bucks you can't get through this movie without wearing something cool. I came to work the first day, and I said I'm not wearing one cool thing. Nothing cool is coming out of me! I'm really finding her that way. It's good to strip down and not be cool. And I'm gonna win that hundred dollars.''</p>
        <p>The March of Verite</p>
        <p>With ''Cinema Verite: Defining the Moment,'' the Canadian filmmaker Peter Wintonick has created the ''That's Entertainment'' of documentaries -- an all-star tribute, generously illustrated with clips and interviews, to the 1960's movement that changed the face of nonfiction filmmaking.</p>
        <p>Armed with the lightweight cameras and sound-recording equipment developed in the 50's, directors like Richard Leacock and Robert Drew (''Primary''), Albert and David Maysles (''Salesman''), D. A. Pennebaker (''Don't Look Back''), Michel Brault (''Les Ordres'') and Frederick Wiseman (''Titicut Follies'') discarded the studied compositions and rhetorical flourishes of the dominant ''March of Time'' style in favor of a more casual, more intimate, less overtly manipulated manner that created a powerful impression of reality.</p>
        <p>''That style is still being used in its purest form by many practitioners,'' Mr. Wintonick said, ''but it's also influenced a lot of audio-visual language, from the Danish Dogma movement to music videos. It's a technique that has great resonance still because it has direct human, dramatic content.''</p>
        <p>Many of the original creators of the style are still at work, and a number of them will be present for an on-stage reunion after the United States premiere of ''Cinema Verite'' on Tuesday at 7 p.m., when it will be the closing night attraction of the New York International Documentary Festival at the Directors Guild of America Theater, 110 West 57th Street, Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''The impulses from 40 years ago are resonating today in different ways,'' Mr. Wintonick noted. ''No matter what one thinks of 'The Blair Witch Project' or 'Time Code,' there is a revolutionary repositioning of the filmmaker in relationship to the economics of making a film, and a lot of that comes from using verite in its new guises. Certainly, it's cheaper.''</p>
