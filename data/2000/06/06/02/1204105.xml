        <p>Some time around 1910, a company of malcontents, political radicals, writers, theater people and artists began to settle in Greenwich Village and declare their down-at-the-heels neighborhood a bohemia in the European mode. Bohemia, since its origins in 1830's Paris, had always trumpeted its social and artistic importance, but this one's claims soared beyond even those of its European predecessors.</p>
        <p>The place seemed to promise an adventure at the cutting edge of avant-garde life. As the nervy journalist John Reed, just arrived from Harvard, lyrically wrote: ''There I got my first perceptions of the life of my times.'' The Village, as its celebrants saw it, would be the laboratory for the new -- making manifest the possibilities of the young century in a way, they hoped, that would prove irresistible to the rest of America.</p>
        <p>Before 1910, the huddle of brownstones, old brick houses, renovated livery stables, tenements and declasse rooming houses had become an antechamber to Manhattan's finer neighborhoods. But fashionable New York -- the blue-blood society of Edith Wharton's and Henry James's Washington Square -- was moving uptown, leaving behind only a few enclaves of stranded elegance like the row of beautiful Greek Revival houses on the north edge of the square.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere, Greenwich Village was an insular neighborhood down on its luck, with empty lots along Fifth Avenue, ''To Let'' signs in storefronts and poor immigrants crowded into the old brick houses, new tenements and sweatshops south of Washington Square and west along the narrow streets toward the Hudson River.</p>
        <p>Working-class residents into the 1930's resisted the fancy appellation of the Village and continued to call the place the Lower West Side. But to the self-styled sophisticates just arriving, the Village offered a stage set  for an exciting, cosmopolitan, perhaps even glorious celebration of modernity in which they would play leading roles. To its enthralled participants, Greenwich Village was very much an American bohemia, fresh, bold and big -- more widespread, both socially and physically, than such counterparts as London's Bloomsbury. It was bounded roughly by Washington Square and Fifth Avenue to the east, 10th Street to the north, Houston Street to the south and the Hudson River to the west.</p>
        <p>Idealistic and ambitious, the newcomers believed they were creating something unprecedented in American arts and letters, unimpeded by the outworn conventions of a stodgy older generation. People who in another time and place would never have talked to one another, never felt compelled to think about one another's existence, found themselves in the same basement restaurants, arguing, agreeing, staging plays, pageants and political rallies, and ruminating endlessly about their entwined love affairs.</p>
        <p>Basement dives like the Golden Swan (better known as the Hell Hole) at the northeast corner of Sixth Avenue and West Fourth Street, once  a favorite watering place of the neighborhood's workingmen, offered cheap food and drink and late-night company. Precincts like the congested blocks around Cornelia Street became picturesque cityscapes. Slums turned into charming ateliers. Low rents beckoned to those willing to put up with a floor of a crumbling row house and live check-by-jowl with  penniless immigrants and their children.</p>
        <p>Young John Reed, yet to win fame for his coverage of the revolutions in Mexico and Russia, thrilled to the plebeian ambience of the borderline slum he shared with a coven of Cambridge classmates on the south edge of Washington Square at No. 42. They wrote for the Midtown newspapers and magazines and, as a labor of love, for the reigning downtown journal, The Masses, at 91 Greenwich Avenue, Max Eastman's monthly that drew on the Village esprit of feminism, socialism and realism -- all mixed with a strong dose of irreverence.</p>
        <p>Greenwich Village in these years was a place for people in transit, looking to make their mark on American culture. More than a few sprang from somewhere eminent (like Harvard) and were destined for prominent futures. Others came from the provincial nowhere (Midwestern farms, hard-bitten factory towns, the depths of immigrant Brooklyn) and were determined to end up somewhere. The latter group included Louise Bryant, the feminist writer and Reed's lover who had shed her marriage to a dentist in Portland, Ore. The poet Edna St. Vincent Millay, from Maine, also figured among the generally dashing New Women. Nationwide, the militant Industrial Workers of the World were fighting a series of violent labor battles; the intellectuals among the Wobblies, as the union members were called, stopped off in the Village for rest and recuperation.</p>
        <p>''Elsewhere . . . barriers went down, and people reached each other who had never been in touch before,'' exulted Mabel Dodge, the Buffalo heiress whose salon provided material and spiritual stimulation for the many restless and needy spirits of the new bohemia. Dodge arrived in Manhattan after years of sumptuous living in a Florentine villa.</p>
        <p>She had grown tired, however, of the languorous expatriate life, and she was on the lookout for something vital. Rich as she was, Dodge could have moved uptown and established herself as a patron of the arts: she did indeed make a name for herself as an organizer of the 1913 International Exhibition of Modern Art, the scandalous blockbuster Armory show that was New York's first look at Europe's most advanced art. But Dodge sensed more potent possibilities downtown and set herself up in a luxurious apartment at 23 Fifth Avenue, just north of Washington Square and the Hotel Brevoort, a bohemian gathering place for late-night discussions, celebrations of literary and painterly successes and trysts.</p>
        <p>Dodge, with the help of new bohemian friends, issued a bountiful invitation to a jumble of Villagers to join her in weekly ''evenings.'' There was a touch of the aristocratic salon in the opulent antique furniture and the sumptuous buffet. Yet Dodge's passion was not cultivated conversation but free speech, the left-wing political cause of the moment that was also the left-wing cultural cause.</p>
        <p>Because the censorship laws of the time were tied up with the repression of radicalism in both politics and art, the battle for bold, honest, forthright truth-telling allied soapbox rabblerousers to birth-control advocates to modern artists. Walter Lippmann came from the Olympian precincts of The New Republic to partake of the free-speech evenings, and so did the anarchist leader Emma Goldman, the birth-control activist Margaret Sanger, and the French painter Jean Crotti (newly arrived from a Europe being ravaged by World War I and, like many fellow Parisian expatriates, besotted with the energy of Manhattan).</p>
        <p>They all crowded into Dodge's Italianate rooms to shock, argue, debate and persuade. The assortment of people was extraordinary: feminists, poets, psychoanalysts, newspapermen, novelists, anarchists, painters, critics and labor organizers. The thread that held them together was the impulse to smash the conventions of their country and remake it with revolutionary ardor.</p>
        <p>Everywhere in the Village, free speech defined bohemian sophistication -- bounding from one subject to another, ostentatiously eclectic, touching on politics and art one moment and churning up neighborhood gossip the next, always edged with a sexual raciness that was taboo in polite society. The impulse was to set up frames for the random talk and the heterogeneous talkers, as if the principles of modernist collage with which Braque and Picasso were experimenting at the moment in Paris had traveled to New York to become embedded in montages of talk.</p>
        <p>There was a supper club for free-speech conversation in Patchin Place, where the brilliant political essayist Randolph Bourne joined feminist friends one night to hear Carl Jung describe his dream psychology. Patchin Place, a tiny gloomy court in the shadow of Jefferson Market Courthouse, once conveniently abutted by the Women's House of Detention, might have seemed like a London rookery; electricity, running water and indoor toilets were lacking. But the newest of the Village's New Women gravitated there -- among them Bryant and the writer Djuna Barnes -- to paint their castoff furniture in screaming Fauve colors and join an excited collective life that spilled over from one apartment to the next.</p>
        <p>The principle of tolerance reigned,  an activist tolerance that threw up a banner of welcome to out-of-the-ordinary encounters and challenging ideas. When the local, genteel Liberal Club in 1912 balked at admitting Goldman and the historian W. E. B. Dubois (who had come to the Village from Atlanta to edit the recently founded N.A.A.C.P.'s journal) on the grounds of politics (Goldman) and race (Dubois), the bohemian cadre bolted and set up their own insistently bohemian Liberal Club at 137 Macdougal Street in a ramshackle old row house.</p>
        <p>The new club blossomed with conviviality, come-hither sociability, emancipated talk and liberated sex. The decor stressed the differences of this ''new'' club for men and women from the Victorian gentlemen's or ladies' club: no William Morris wallpaper or deep upholstered furniture. Instead, there were bare wood floors and tables, Cubist and Fauve art on the walls, chairs painted in fiery Futurist oranges and acid yellows. The clientele included young women from the heartland who had fled  their families, Jewish socialists, left-leaning lawyers, at least one Princeton dropout (the playwright Eugene O'Neill), the golden young Harvard men like Reed and Lippmann, theater people, journalists, poets -- both famous and aspiring -- ''all the tin pot revolutionaries and sophomoric advanced thinkers in New York,'' the curmudgeonly newspaperman H. L. Mencken -- definitely not in their circle -- dubbed them.</p>
        <p>The crowd gathered in the late afternoons and stayed on, talking, drinking, dancing to the player piano (not mannerly waltzes but the Turkey Trot and the shimmy), drifting downstairs for a meal at Polly Holladay's restaurant or a visit to the Boni Brothers' bookstore next door at No. 135, then back upstairs to listen to talks that ranged from disquisitions on the tango to reports of the latest battle on the labor front. Love affairs materialized and spouses cast off familiar roles to flirt, dance and talk as comrades, friends and colleagues.</p>
        <p>This bohemia was in-dwelling and self-dramatizing -- literally so, since the Liberal Club's drama group put the membership's own psychosexual dilemmas onstage in amateur theatricals that coalesced into the Provincetown Playhouse, at 139 Macdougal Street, which stayed in place as a professional company after the club and its bohemian theater had folded.</p>
        <p>In the summer of 1916, the Provincetown Players began performing on Cape Cod, where a number of Villagers were vacationing. Returning to New York, the Players set themselves up in a complex of buildings on Macdougal Street that grew out of the Liberal Club. The group would produce several of O'Neill's plays.</p>
        <p>Many Jewish radicals drifted over from the nearby Lower East Side with its own lively cultural scene and commingled with the Village bohemians. One of them, the firebrand Emma Goldman, held forth to American artists and theater critics at Justus Schwab's saloon at 51 First Street and turned herself from an anarchist political leader into a downtown celebrity.</p>
        <p>East of Cooper Square, the Lower East Side and the Village leached into each other. Immigrant radicals and artists gathered for adult education at the anarchist Ferrer Center (which moved from 6 St. Mark's Place to 104 East 12th Street), ambled back and forth to the Liberal Club and even attended Dodge's tony evenings; Village bohemians trekked over to East 12th Street to lecture to working-class audiences.</p>
        <p>There were departures as well. Emmanuel Radnitsky, who would soon rename himself Man Ray, moved from the Village across the Hudson to found an artists' colony in a flimsy collection of shacks on the Palisades near Ridgefield, N.J., taking with him an assortment of Village and Ferrer writers, painters and poets. Soon, Marcel Duchamp, another arrival from Paris, would join this Bohemia West and turn it into the hot spot of New York Dada, its antic proclamations issued by the marvelously titled broadsheet The Ridgefield Gazook.</p>
        <p>None of this would last long. Once the new subway stop at Sheridan Square was completed in 1917, tourists and uptown visitors flooded in, flush with World War I cash and hungry for the forbidden pleasures that bohemia supposedly provided. Real estate agents, now alert to the value of crumbling houses that could be subdivided infinitely into authentic ''artists' studios,'' ratcheted up the rents. Village conversation, always tending to the left, was suspect -- even illegal -- under the repressive antiradical wartime laws the government instituted. Writers found themselves subject to arrest and trial for ''seditious'' speech.</p>
        <p>While some people were in court, others turned into marketable parodies of themselves. A new class of ''authentic'' bohemian guides escorted visitors to ''real'' Village hideaways, like the Bruno's Garret, run by the local entrepreneur Guido Bruno, at 58 Washington Square South, where down-and-out women impersonated poets and artists' models.</p>
        <p>The ''real'' bohemia, the Old Guard lamented, was gone, displaced by the real estate men, newcomers battened on uptown money, the would-be's and the fakes. The very jeremiads they unleashed would prove to be one of their enduring achievements as, over time, a succession of bohemias would unfurl on the original spot, each holding the stage a moment, then sputtering out, giving way to sponsors of an even newer ''new.''</p>
        <p>From 1919 on, the real Village has been ever elusive and lamented, lingering in memory as the moment before the latest generation of usurpers took over.</p>
        <p>Salons and Saloons</p>
        <p>Here are the historical sites discussed in the article on Greenwich Village.</p>
        <p>CORNELIA STREET, between the Avenue of the Americas (Sixth Avenue back then)  and Bleecker Street. The ambience of the  Village in the teens can best be glimpsed by walking down Cornelia Street, off the avenue. The area of crooked, congested streets  was considerably larger and less commercialized in those days, before Sixth and Seventh Avenues were cut through.</p>
        <p>MABEL DODGE'S APARTMENT, 23 Fifth Avenue. This was at the eastern nexus of Village life, near the rooming houses where her friends the Harvard men lived along the south edge of Washington Square.</p>
        <p>FERRER CENTER, 104 East 12th Street. The New York outpost of an international movement to commemorate Francisco Ferrer, a Barcelona educator, anarchist and martyr of the left. The group was housed first at 6 St. Mark's Place, just off Third Avenue, then in more spacious quarters on 12th Street between Third and Fourth Avenues (now a parking lot).</p>
        <p>THE GOLDEN SWAN, northeast corner of Sixth Avenue and Fourth Street. This long-gone bar, more commonly known as the Hell Hole, drew the heavy drinkers among the bohemians, most notably Eugene O'Neill and his cronies. Now the site of a bank, it once furnished the imaginative material for ''The Iceman Cometh.''</p>
        <p>THE HOTEL BREVOORT, northeast corner of Fifth Avenue and Eighth Street. The hotel, on the site now occupied by the Brevoort apartment house, was a watering hole, gathering spot and trysting place where bohemian personages lived, ate and caroused.</p>
        <p>LIBERAL CLUB, 137 Macdougal Street. The ''Meeting Place for Those Interested in New Ideas,'' as the letterhead read. In 1914 the walls were broken through to the Boni Brothers' bookshop at No. 135 to join the two. Polly Holladay's restaurant was also in the building.</p>
        <p>THE MASSES, 91 Greenwich Avenue. Max Eastman's radical monthly was suppressed in 1918 for its opposition to World War I. Today, its former site, between West 12th and Bank Streets, is overlapped by two restaurants.</p>
        <p>PATCHIN PLACE can be glimpsed through a gate on 10th Street between Greenwich Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas, its gloomy exterior much as it was in the 1910's, when its neighbors were the Women's House of Detention and the Victorian Jefferson Market Courthouse, now the site of a public library branch.</p>
        <p>PROVINCETOWN PLAYHOUSE, 139 Macdougal Street. The Playhouse, in the late teens, became part of the complex that grew out of the Liberal Club. Christine Ell's restaurant, considered the heir to Polly Holladay's next door, was on the second floor of No. 139. Together with the Boni Brothers' bookshop at No. 135 and the Liberal Club at 137, this formed a trio of buildings that were knocked down and rebuilt as an enlarged theater for the Provincetown Players.</p>
        <p>JUSTUS SCHWAB'S, 51 First Street, between First and Second Avenues. Emma Goldman set herself up in the anarchist Schwab's saloon just as the celebrities from the Yiddish theater did in other such establishments on the Lower East Side. She entertained well-wishers and visiting revolutionaries here and gave interviews to reporters. Although No. 51 has been destroyed, the rest of the block is much as it was in Goldman's day.</p>
        <p>WASHINGTON SQUARE. The radical journalist John Reed and his Harvard friends lived at No. 42, a site now occupied by New York University, on the already raffish southern border of the square -- a far cry from the fashionable houses that were the setting for Henry James's novel ''Washington Square,'' remnants of which can still be seen on the northern edge of the square.</p>
