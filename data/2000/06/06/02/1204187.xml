        <p>The remnants of Boo.com, the fashion Web retailer that sought bankruptcy here last week when investors refused to give it more cash, were acquired today by Fashionmall.com, a New York Internet company, for an undisclosed price.</p>
        <p>The deal opens a new chapter in the troubled life of Boo.com, which was originally backed by the French luxury-goods magnate Bernard Arnault, the Benetton family of Italy, J. P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs, among others.</p>
        <p>Founded by two 29-year-old Swedish entrepreneurs, the company burned through $:125 million, or about $188 million, in just six months in an attempt to create a worldwide fashion e-tailer selling goods in multiple languages and currencies.</p>
        <p>Boo.com's rapid expansion and its staff's spending on luxury offices, first-class plane travel and five-star hotels came to symbolize the excesses of the Internet boom.</p>
        <p>Although its Internet technology won raves for an ability to let users view clothes in three dimensions from all angles, the company failed to generate the kind of business it had envisioned. Boo.com's demise was Europe's biggest Internet collapse.</p>
        <p>The sale of Boo.com's remains today to Fashionmall.com includes the Boo.com brand, Web address, advertising materials and online content. The deal does not include any of Boo.com's back-end technology, distribution and fulfillment systems or physical assets. Boo.com's back-end technology was sold earlier this week to Bright Station P.L.C., a British Internet company, for $:250,000 -- a fraction of the reported $:70 million Boo.com was said to have paid for it. KPMG, the consulting and advisory firm, is handling the liquidation.</p>
        <p>Benjamin Nasarin, chief executive of Fashionmall.com, declined to say how much he spent, but said it was more than what Bright Station paid.</p>
        <p>Fashionmall.com opened in 1994 as one of the first Internet fashion sites. It plans to use the Boo.com brand to create a high-end site similar to its existing one rather than continue to run the company as an online retailer.</p>
        <p>''They did a phenomenal job building their brand,'' Mr. Nasarin said. ''They were probably ahead of their time, but such is life.''</p>
        <p>Fashionmall.com is hoping to migrate Boo.com's existing customers to a new site using the same name that will act as a virtual mall, selling goods through separate vendors and charging a commission for each sale.</p>
        <p>Despite Boo.com's troubles, it attracted more visitors than Fashionmall.com. According to Media Metrix, a research firm that tracks Internet site visits, Boo.com recorded 558,000 visitors in April, versus 208,000 for Fashionmall.com.</p>
        <p>Analysts questioned the rationale for buying a brand that has the taint of failure.</p>
        <p>''It's been much maligned,'' Ken Cassar, senior retail analyst at Jupiter Communications said of Boo. com's brand. ''It's an open question if it's an asset or liability.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Nasarin said, ''The brand has not been tarnished.''</p>
        <p>''The company's business plan may have been tarnished,'' he added, ''but I'm not buying their business plan.''</p>
        <p>INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS  Correction:  June 3, 2000, Saturday  An article in Business Day yesterday about the sale of some assets of Boo.com to Fashionmall.com misspelled the surname of Fashionmall .com's chief executive. He is Benjamin Narasin, not Nasarin.</p>
