        <p>Technology stocks roared ahead yesterday, propelling the Nasdaq composite index to its seventh-best gain in percentage terms, up 5.34 percent. That performance followed Tuesday's record 7.9 percent rise.</p>
        <p>The index surged 181.59 points, to  3,582.50, and cut the Nasdaq's losses on the year to nearly 12 percent.</p>
        <p>After Wednesday's downturn, investors became re-enthused yesterday as the economic news of the day suggested that the economy was slowing markedly from the breakneck pace that had led the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates six times since last June.</p>
        <p>''We're beginning to see the impact'' of Alan Greenspan's slow-acting but powerful anti-inflation medicine, said Frank Cappiello of McCullough, Andrews &amp; Cappiello in Baltimore. ''We sense that he's gotten near the end of raising rates. And if that's the case, then these tech stocks are woefully underpriced.''</p>
        <p>The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index also posted a gain, up 28.21 points, or 1.99 percent, to 1,448.81, while the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 129.87 points, or 1.23 percent, to 10,652.20.</p>
        <p>News of slackened industrial costs and construction spending left many analysts unpersuaded that rate increases were near an end and that this spring's stock slide was over.</p>
        <p>''I'm skeptical,'' said Byron R. Wien, chief United States strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. He said the economic slowing was from a ''very feverish'' pace, suggesting that more Fed tightening might be needed, and that in any event corporate earnings growth was probably on the wane. ''I would certainly have a defensive position'' toward stocks, Mr. Wien advised.</p>
        <p>In Atlanta, Robert M. Balentine, chief executive of the investment counselors Balentine &amp; Company, took a similar view. ''We're simply seeing some bounce off the lows,'' he said. ''We would use the rally to raise cash for better buying opportunities ahead rather than think the worst is behind us.''</p>
        <p>And while the skeptics cited continued subdued trading volume as evidence that the rally lacked enthusiasm, there has been a clear improvement lately in the proportion of stocks moving higher. Yesterday, 2,061 New York Stock Exchange issues advanced while 927 declined, and new 52-week highs nearly doubled new lows, 68 to 35.</p>
        <p>The ratio was even better for the S.&amp; P. 500, where 353 stocks rose while 131 declined and 16 were unchanged.</p>
        <p>Several Nasdaq issues posted double-digit gains, with the heavily weighted Cisco Systems up 4, to 60 15/16, having the biggest impact.</p>
        <p>Hewlett-Packard, up 14 3/8, to 134 1/2, after a meeting that impressed security analysts, accounted for nearly two-thirds of the Dow's rise. Intel climbed 5, to 129 11/16.</p>
        <p>Although the market for initial public offerings has been severely chilled of late, ONI Systems, a fiber optics company, attracted huge demand for 8 million shares it offered late Tuesday at 25. The stock started trading yesterday at 75, climbed as high as 86 and finished at 82 9/16.</p>

        <p>Treasury Prices Climb</p>
        <p>(By Reuters) -- Treasury bond prices rose strongly yesterday after another economic report suggested that the nation's economy was slowing and interest rates might be near their peaks.</p>
        <p>The report that manufacturing activity grew in May, but at its slowest pace in more than a year, followed similarly soft data on retail sales and orders for big-ticket items.</p>
        <p>The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 30/32, to 104 11/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.94 percent from 6 percent on Wednesday. The price of the 10-year bond rose 21/32, to 102 11/32, while its yield declined to 6.17 percent from 6.26 percent.</p>
        <p>Results of yesterday's Treasury auctions of 12-day cash management bills:</p>
        <p>(000 omitted in dollar figures)  Price: 99.827  Investment rate: 5.20%  High rate: 5.27%  Low rate: 4.98%  Median rate: 5.10%  Total applied for: $20,045,088  Accepted: $7,018,488  Noncompetitive: -0-</p>
        <p>The 12-day cash management bills mature June 14.</p>
