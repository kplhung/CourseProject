        <p>Paula Cooper Gallery</p>

        <p>Through June 9</p>
        <p>Rudolf Stingel continues to trip painting's light fantastic, eliciting striking visual effects from unlikely means.</p>
        <p>Here he walks on one of his preferred materials -- large, thick slabs of Styrofoam, in this case white -- wearing shoes dipped in acid. The acid eats easily into the Styrofoam, leaving footprints. The slabs are arranged in big rectangles on the wall and, voila, the pleasures of untouched canvas and the white-on-white monochrome are conflated with those of walking through freshly fallen snow.</p>

        <p>Rudolf Stingel continues to trip painting's light fantastic, eliciting striking visual effects from unlikely means.</p>
        <p>Here he walks on one of his preferred materials -- large, thick slabs of Styrofoam, in this case white -- wearing shoes dipped in acid. The acid eats easily into the Styrofoam, leaving footprints. The slabs are arranged in big rectangles on the wall and, voila, the pleasures of untouched canvas and the white-on-white monochrome are conflated with those of walking through freshly fallen snow.</p>
        <p>Also conflated are the techniques of Jackson Pollock, said to dance around and occasionally step on his horizontal canvases while delivering his drips of paint, and Andy Warhol's ''Oxidation'' paintings, where the acid was urine.</p>
        <p>None of this would matter much if the paintings didn't reward visual attention, but their combination of radiance, scale and economy has an oddly satisfying allure.</p>
