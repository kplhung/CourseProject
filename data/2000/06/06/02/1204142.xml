        <p>The ultrasound wire poked from underneath the bandage on his left hand, causing Scottie Pippen's two dislocated fingers to look like an antenna.</p>
        <p>''It's some new technology we're trying out, to see if Mike can send me some signals from the bench,'' Pippen, referring to Coach Mike Dunleavy, said today.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Pippen was a beacon for the Portland Trail Blazers as they avoided elimination with a 96-88 victory Tuesday night against the Lakers at Los Angeles. Even after sustaining the injury to his nonshooting hand early in the second quarter, Pippen continued to play aggressively and energized the Trail Blazers' chances in the four-of-seven-game Western Conference finals.</p>
        <p>For a team that trails three games to two, the Trail Blazers sound as though they are in command of this series. Their confidence hinged on the fact that Game 6 is Friday night at home in the Rose Garden, where the Lakers won Games 3 and 4.</p>
        <p>The Trail Blazers contend that the odds of losing three straight games at home are as improbable as Pippen's not playing Friday night.</p>
        <p>The Trail Blazers had the fifth-best home record in the National Basketball Association during the regular season and were 5-0 in the playoffs until the Lakers beat them.</p>
        <p>''Scottie gave up his body for the whole game and really motivated us to take the ball to the hole strong,'' Brian Grant said of Pippen's 22 points, 6 steals, 6 rebounds and 4 blocked shots in Game 5. ''That is the thing we haven't been doing the past couple games.''</p>
        <p>Pippen said of his two dislocated fingers: ''I feel better. I've got a little more motion in them. I'll be fine.''</p>
        <p>Pippen's hand and the sprained foot of the Lakers' Kobe Bryant's are the subplots to Game 6.</p>
        <p>While Pippen took control of his team, Bryant faded from the Lakers' offense, especially after hurting his foot in the first quarter. He forced shots and passes, finishing with 17 points on 4-of-13 shooting. And he had six turnovers before fouling out with 4 minutes 45 seconds to play. He missed practice today.</p>
        <p>The Trail Blazers' defense, especially Pippen, has clamped down hard on Bryant, who is 9 of 28 in the last two games. For the series, he has averaged 17 points, shot 40.6 percent and made 15 turnovers, well off his numbers (24 points, 7 turnovers and 55.6 percent shooting) in three regular-season games against the Trail Blazers.</p>
        <p>''There had been a lot of talk about Kobe guarding Pippen and doing what he had done,'' Dunleavy said. 'Basically, I said the game plan was to go at Kobe more.</p>
        <p>''I don't necessarily think that is an advantage for them,'' Dunleavy said of a Bryant-Pippen matchup. ''Scottie has done a great job of orchestrating things. It's important for us to have him go at Kobe and make Kobe have to defend.''</p>
        <p>Bryant's only breakout came in Game 3, when he scored 25 points, including 18 in the first half, to keep the Lakers afloat with a 93-91 victory.</p>
        <p>''They're not giving him any space to operate out there,'' Lakers Coach Phil Jackson said. ''I think that he's trying to figure out how to get himself free. As a consequence, once he takes his second dribble, they're able to jump all over him.''</p>
