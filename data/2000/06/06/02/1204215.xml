        <p>Rand McNally in Skokie, Ill., said yesterday that it had named three units of the B Com3  Group -- the Leo Burnett Company, Starcom Worldwide and Starcom IP, all in Chicago -- as its first creative and media agencies. Billings were estimated at $10 million to $15 million.</p>
        <p>The assignment covers the Rand McNally traditional books and maps as well as Randmcnally.com, which is to be expanded to help consumers think of the company as more of a travel adviser than a map publisher. The decision came after a three-month review that had been narrowed to the Burnett/Starcom team and four undisclosed agencies.</p>
