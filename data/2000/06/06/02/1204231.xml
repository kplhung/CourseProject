        <p>Chelsea</p>
        <p>Through June 10</p>
        <p>Meyer Vaisman's startling and haunting sculpture ''Barbara Fischer/Psychoanalysis and Psychotherapy'' centers on the whole-body cast of a naked, corpulent older woman. Spotlighted in the middle of the nearly empty gallery, she sits up on a plywood pedestal enveloped in see-through pink tulle and wearing a jester's belled cap. In her hands, she holds a harlequin's suit patched together from men's and women's clothing. On the wall across from her, six flickering candles in glass containers add religious overtones.</p>
        <p>Based on its title, one can make some sense of this riddling work. The woman might be a kind of therapist-as-mother-as-priestess whose nakedness signifies her psychic openness and who holds in her nurturing arms -- like Mary cradling her crucified son in the ''Pieta'' -- the scrambled male and female energies of her patient's damaged soul.</p>

        <p>Meyer Vaisman's startling and haunting sculpture ''Barbara Fischer/Psychoanalysis and Psychotherapy'' centers on the whole-body cast of a naked, corpulent older woman. Spotlighted in the middle of the nearly empty gallery, she sits up on a plywood pedestal enveloped in see-through pink tulle and wearing a jester's belled cap. In her hands, she holds a harlequin's suit patched together from men's and women's clothing. On the wall across from her, six flickering candles in glass containers add religious overtones.</p>
        <p>Based on its title, one can make some sense of this riddling work. The woman might be a kind of therapist-as-mother-as-priestess whose nakedness signifies her psychic openness and who holds in her nurturing arms -- like Mary cradling her crucified son in the ''Pieta'' -- the scrambled male and female energies of her patient's damaged soul.</p>
        <p>A little background information deepens the intrigue. The woman was, until recently, Mr. Vaisman's longtime therapist, and the clown suit was assembled from clothes belonging to his parents. Photographic decals adhering to the glass candle holders show the artist himself in sad-clown makeup wearing the suit while disconsolately drinking beer and smoking cigarettes in a children's playground. (This gets funnier the more you think about it.)</p>
        <p>Whether we should take all this as a loving tribute or something more darkly complicated is hard to say, considering Mr. Vaisman's history as a Warholian ironist. Nevertheless, it stands as a richly suggestive metaphor of psychospiritual healing and possibly the most compelling thing this artist has ever produced.</p>
