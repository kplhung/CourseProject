        <p>Editorial opposes New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's proposal for cut in Legal Aid Society funding, particularly in light of increasingly heavy load of drug-related cases handled by Legal Aid</p>

        <p>The increasing number of drug-related and ''quality-of-life'' arrests in New York City has strained resources and expanded already bursting caseloads at the Legal Aid Society, the main nonprofit agency providing representation for indigent defendants. The creation of new groups to take over some of Legal Aid's work, moreover, has produced significantly less in the way of caseload relief than City Hall originally forecast.</p>
        <p>Yet in a familiar waltz, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has proposed a big cut in Legal Aid's funding. The mayor's budget contemplates a $5.5 million reduction in city funding -- the same amount the City Council added to Legal Aid's allocation in last year's budget round.</p>

        <p>The increasing number of drug-related and ''quality-of-life'' arrests in New York City has strained resources and expanded already bursting caseloads at the Legal Aid Society, the main nonprofit agency providing representation for indigent defendants. The creation of new groups to take over some of Legal Aid's work, moreover, has produced significantly less in the way of caseload relief than City Hall originally forecast.</p>
        <p>Yet in a familiar waltz, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has proposed a big cut in Legal Aid's funding. The mayor's budget contemplates a $5.5 million reduction in city funding -- the same amount the City Council added to Legal Aid's allocation in last year's budget round.</p>
        <p>Once again the Council seems prepared to provide additional money for Legal Aid. The question is how much. Legal Aid is asking the Council to add $12 million to the mayor's allocation -- the amount it says is necessary to make up for a $2 million deficit from this year and meet current caseload demands.</p>
        <p>The request seems reasonable in light of the city's obligation to provide quality legal representation for the accused. It also seems reasonable when compared with the costs of the quality-of-life campaign, Operation Condor, which has produced a huge increase in drug arrests and $39 million in police overtime.</p>
