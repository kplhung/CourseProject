        <p>Russia's next federal budget should be balanced for the first time in the government's 10-year history, even allowing for a sizable increase in social spending, Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov told the cabinet today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kasyanov, until last month Russia's finance minister, said federal spending in the proposed 2001 budget totals about $38 billion, or roughly 17 percent of Russia's gross domestic product.

        <p>Russia's next federal budget should be balanced for the first time in the government's 10-year history, even allowing for a sizable increase in social spending, Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov told the cabinet today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kasyanov, until last month Russia's finance minister, said federal spending in the proposed 2001 budget totals about $38 billion, or roughly 17 percent of Russia's gross domestic product. Inflation was estimated to run about 11 percent a year, slightly below the 12 to 14 percent projected for 2000.</p>
        <p>''For the first time, we are examining basic parameters of a draft budget which has no deficit,'' he told the cabinet.</p>
        <p>Russia's current budget runs a primary surplus, meaning that domestic programs are fully financed, but after foreign debt payments the deficit is expected to total about 1.1 percent of the gross domestic product.</p>
        <p>The 2001 fiscal program is buoyed in part by better-than-expected performance of the nation's economy and by the government's tenatative decision to stop paying for many programs that benefit upper classes as well as the poor.</p>
