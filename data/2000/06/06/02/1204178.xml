        <p>Eight candidates have been crowded together in the primary for New Jersey's Seventh Congressional District since January, and tempers are starting to flare.</p>
        <p>In the Democratic race, Michael J. Lapolla, the Union County manager, broadcast a radio commercial that portrayed his principal opponent, Maryanne Connelly, as an indecisive airhead. Ms. Connelly replied by calling Mr. Lapolla sexist.</p>
        <p>On the Republican side, Patrick Morrissey, a former House staff member, says that one of his opponents, Thomas H. Kean Jr., the son of the former governor, is not mature enough to compete in the political big leagues. Michael A. Ferguson, who moved into the Seventh District after losing badly in the Sixth in 1998, says one rival, Assemblyman Joel M. Weingarten, should be ashamed of ever having voted for higher taxes.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Weingarten, an assemblyman and the only Republican in the race ever to have been elected to office, has cast his rivals as a bunch of Generation X-ers who don't know how to wait their turn and pay their dues. ''Young people these days feel they can just jump to the head of the line,'' said Mr. Weingarten, who is all of 40.</p>
        <p>There are 31 vacant House seats up for grabs in November, and both parties believe that New Jersey's Seventh District race is one of the most competitive.</p>
        <p>Taking in most of Union County and parts of Somerset and Middlesex Counties, the district has 20,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans, yet it has elected Representative Bob Franks, a moderate Republican, to Congress four times.</p>
        <p>''This race is on everybody's radar screen,'' said Stephen A. Salmore, a professor of politics at Rutgers and a Republican political consultant.</p>
        <p>John Del Cecato, a spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said the Seventh was crucial to his party's campaign to take control of the House by winning six new seats.</p>
        <p>''It's one of our best opportunities in the country to pick up a Republican-held seat,'' Mr. Del Cecato said. ''It's a competitive open seat with a suburban electorate that has been trending Democratic.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks's decision in December to give up the seat to run for the United States Senate set off a mad scramble among three of the four Republican candidates, who were living outside the district. Their rush to establish residency here is one of the major issues in the Republican primary.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ferguson, 29, a Brookdale College teacher and education consultant, had declared that he would once again challenge Representative Frank Pallone Jr., the Democrat in the adjoining Sixth District, to whom he lost by 25,000 votes in 1998. But when Mr. Franks announced that he would give up the seat, Mr. Ferguson moved into the Seventh, taking with him the money he had raised in the Sixth.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kean, 31, was working on his doctorate in international relations in Boston when Mr. Franks announced, and he promptly moved into the district. Mr. Morrissey, 32, moved up from Washington, where he had been a Republican Congressional staff member. Of the four Republicans, only Mr. Weingarten had lived in the district.</p>
        <p>Early polls showed Mr. Kean as the clear front-runner, the only Republican with name recognition in double digits. His father, Thomas H. Kean, was governor of the state from 1982 to 1990, and the family name is fondly remembered in New Jersey. Yet despite the backing of the Senate president, Donald T. DiFrancesco, and several other prominent Republicans, the younger Mr. Kean failed to win the Republican Party endorsement in any of the district's three counties; Mr. Weingarten won in Union County, and Mr. Ferguson in Somerset and Middlesex.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kean has the most liberal positions on key issues, including abortion rights and gun control, which could give him an edge in a Democratic-leaning district, Mr. Salmore said. Mr. Kean seemed to agree.</p>
        <p>''I think the people of this district are looking for someone who can reach out not only to a broad range of Republicans but also reach across and bring in Democrats,'' Mr. Kean said, ''because that's the only way we're going to win this district.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Kean's candidacy has not caught fire -- he acknowledges that he sometimes appears nervous and halting in his speech -- and local politicians now think the race is between Mr. Ferguson and Mr. Weingarten.</p>
        <p>Gabriel Petruccelli, a Democrat, complained to Mr. Kean at a campaign stop here that his real estate taxes were so high that he could not afford, at 70, to retire from his job as a maintenance worker. After Mr. Kean moved on, Mr. Petruccelli brought up the carpetbagger charge.</p>
        <p>''I only go by what the papers print out,'' Mr. Petruccelli said. ''He's been up in Boston all this time. I don't think he's been in the district long enough.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ferguson has focused his campaign on bread-and-butter issues like simplifying the tax code, cutting taxes and paying down the national debt, all issues that the candidates generally agree on. Like Mr. Morrissey, he would outlaw abortion, with exceptions. (Mr. Weingarten supports abortion rights, but with restrictions.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Morrissey has tried to stake out a distinct spot in the race by stressing a plan to simplify and extend federal health services and emphasizing his experience as counsel on health issues for the House Commerce Committee.</p>
        <p>His plan is to float above the conservative dogfight between Mr. Weingarten and Mr. Ferguson and to hope that his support in a four-way race, with only a plurality needed to win, will be enough to secure the party nomination.</p>
        <p>''Everyone supports tax cuts, everyone supports reduced spending, everybody talks the same,'' Mr. Morrissey said in an interview. ''But if you have one candidate talking about health care reform, that wins people over.''</p>
        <p>If the Republicans in the race sound similar on most issues, the Democratic contenders are policy quadruplets, and have had to scratch to find any differences among them. In addition to Mr. Lapolla and Ms. Connelly, the Democrats are Joel Farley, , a lawyer from Westfield, and Jeffrey Golkin, 43, a member of the Warren Township Committee, or town council.</p>
        <p>A debate on May 2 failed to unearth any disagreements on the issues: all support expanded Medicaid entitlements, stricter gun controls and abortion rights.</p>
        <p>Ms. Connelly, the former mayor of Fanwood, won her party's backing to take on Mr. Franks in an apparently hopeless race in 1998, yet she came within 11,000 votes of winning. This year, with the seat open, county party leaders abandoned Ms. Connelly and gave their support to Mr. Lapolla, 43, a former Union County freeholder. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee even took the unusual step of endorsing Mr. Lapolla before the primary, angering Ms. Connelly.</p>
        <p>''It's the exception rather than the rule,'' the committee's Mr. Del Cecato said of the decision to favor Mr. Lapolla. ''But we need to have our strongest possible candidate in the general election.''</p>
        <p>With Mr. Lapolla considered well out front in the race, Democrats in the district were surprised to hear a sharp attack from Mr. Lapolla in a radio advertisement.</p>
        <p>In the ad, an actress plays Ms. Connelly as a squeaky-voiced bub blehead in a quiz show, ''Who Wants to Be a Member of Congress?'' Asked for her positions on school vouchers, the Connelly character requests a weather report so she can see ''which way the political winds are blowing.''</p>
        <p>Offended, Ms. Connelly accused Mr. Lapolla of sexism for depicting her as dumb and indecisive. The backlash won her support from the National Organization for Women and an endorsement from Emily's List, the feminist fund-raising group.</p>
