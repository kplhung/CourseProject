        <p>Signs of the new millennium will be as scarce as unicorns at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine tomorrow. In fact, the atmosphere on the church grounds will be more reminiscent of the year 1000 than 2000.</p>
        <p>The green will be the site of the cathedral's second annual Family Day Festival, which highlights the arts of the Middle Ages. And while no unicorns will prance, there will be at least one coyote -- part of a show that children will help prepare at the green's small puppet theater.</p>
        <p>''It's a Native American tale about a coyote in New York,'' said Nicole Paoli-Ramos, the cathedral's assistant director of public education.</p>
        <p>In addition to creating puppets, children can design colorful masks or make brass rubbings from pieces patterned after those in cathedrals like Westminster Abbey.</p>
        <p>They can also make paper, string floral wreaths, try weaving, blow bubbles and construct pinwheels to spin in the breeze. Not to mention spinning themselves: the festival will offer Irish and medieval dance.</p>
        <p>Finally, families can help create labyrinth walks, the paths of meditation found at many cathedrals. Drawn on canvas or laid out with ropes, a medieval labyrinth is intricate but still easy to follow.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't have dead ends, which I think is symbolic because you can't get lost,'' Ms. Paoli-Ramos said. ''It represents a pilgrimage or journey, like the pilgrimage to a cathedral.''</p>
        <p>Family Day Festival, tomorrow from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. (rain or shine) at the Pulpit Green of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, 111th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, Morningside Heights, (212) 932-7347. Free.</p>
        <p>Fusion and Fun</p>
        <p>Tomorrow you are invited to come as close as is humanly possible to the everyday activities of stars.</p>
        <p>This doesn't mean breakfast with Tom Cruise or exercising with Julia Roberts. The stars are the ones in the sky, and studying their function is the purpose of the United States Department of Energy's Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory.</p>
        <p>The laboratory's open house will introduce families to plasma physics, which scientists hope will eventually provide a clean, safe, efficient fuel. Plasma is a gas heated to such an extreme temperature that its atoms fuse, releasing vast amounts of energy. The process is the same means by which the sun converts hydrogen to helium.</p>
        <p>''Our sun is really a giant fusion reactor,'' said Anthony R. DeMeo, a spokesman for the laboratory.</p>
        <p>The laboratory has a much smaller one, the Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor, which has produced the hottest temperature ever recorded on earth: 510 million degrees Celsius. Nearby is the latest fusion equipment, the National Spherical Torus Experiment. (Unlike nuclear reactors, fusion reactors pose no danger to visitors.)</p>
        <p>''People will be able to go into the test cell where the Torus is,'' Mr. DeMeo said. ''It looks like a big Christmas ornament.''</p>
        <p>These places of extreme heat have inspired experiments that children will find very cool. They can manipulate magnets (which are also involved in fusion) so they attract one another instead of repel; create giant soap bubbles, which are models for the turbulence that occurs in plasma; and light a fluorescent bulb (it, too, has plasma) without plugging it in.</p>
        <p>They can watch a cryogenic show, in which materials like rubber balls and flowers are placed in liquid nitrogen, a medium so cold that it alters their physical structure. ''Afterward, you can smash the rubber ball with a hammer,'' Mr. DeMeo said.</p>
        <p>Families can also crawl into a star lab, a kind of portable planetarium, and attend Sports Spectacular shows, which illustrate the physics behind games like baseball and hockey. And, of course, they can enjoy some sources of human energy, like hot dogs, potato chips and ice cream.</p>
        <p>Open House, tomorrow from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, James Forrestal Campus, off Route 1, Plainsboro, N.J., (609) 243-2750. Free.</p>
        <p>Tender Traps</p>
        <p>Early tomorrow, workers at the Greenburgh Nature Center in Westchester County will cast their nets, hoping for a good catch. They're not fishermen, although you might say they're fly fishing: their quarry won't have fins, but wings.</p>
        <p>The nets, called mist nets, are designed for migratory birds. Virtually invisible, they trap creatures that fly into them, holding them in very soft pockets. The public is invited to watch Dr. Jim Utter, a scientist from the State University of New York at Purchase, and Eric Rowland, the center's museum manager, record information about the birds and gently place numbered bands on their legs before releasing them.</p>
        <p>The data will include ''sex, wing length, weight, and where the bird was caught and the time,'' Mr. Rowland said. Researchers will also use clues like feather patterns and bone structure to estimate the ages of the birds, which are likely to range from catbirds to yellow-rumped warblers.</p>
        <p>Although the banding demonstration will be postponed if it rains, visitors can still see about 140 animal species, both native and non-native, in the center's museum. These include snakes, hedgehogs, hawks and at least one bird with a few tricks the migratory species don't possess.</p>
        <p>''One of our parrots talks really well,'' Mr. Rowland said.</p>
        <p>Bird banding demonstration, tomorrow at 9:30 a.m. at the Greenburgh Nature Center, 99 Dromore Road, off Central Avenue, Scarsdale, (914) 723-3470. Admission (includes all exhibits): $4; members, free.</p>
