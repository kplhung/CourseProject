        <p>Jennifer Muller and her company the Works have covered a wide range of styles in 25 years. Ms. Muller's opening night program on Tuesday at the Joyce Theater suggested that range in its satisfying balance of abstraction and narrative.</p>
        <p>Ms. Muller's new ''Beethoven -- Not Four Naught'' recalls the sly, sleek works of the choreographer's earlier career, as 12 dancers dressed in odd white bits of clothes dash in and out of rank on an all-white stage to a lively Beethoven quartet. Yumiko Yoshikawa, lifted high and spinning out, was a focus in the stylish melee. Other standouts were the willowy Petra van Noort, a giddily bobbing Leonardo Smith and a little creature in an eyeshade, danced by Rosane Fonteyne, who tore through the fray with comical intensity.</p>
        <p>In Ms. Muller's new ''Asolo,'' Mr. Smith is a restless would-be sleeper who moves and talks his way obsessively through daily concerns and life problems that keep him awake. His fast-paced, self-absorbed soliloquy, written by Ms. Muller, is at times hard to follow. But the sound score performed by the pajama-clad Marty Beller, which involves everything from cutting crunchy lettuce to the kinds of pings and rustles that prevent sleep, brilliantly intersected and coincided with Mr. Smith's patter.</p>
        <p>''Hymn for Her,'' a new piece by Ms. Muller set to music by Geoffrey Menin, is a duet for an angel and a mortal who seem equally to need each other. Ms. Yoshikawa was the mortal, tucked into a black chair at the start and end, with Anton Wilson's eloquent angel hanging above her from a trapeze. Editing would have improved the piece, but it was full of poignant moments.</p>
        <p>Ms. Muller's new ''Spores, Solitude and  Summer Humming,'' a pure-dance piece for eight set to music performed on tape by Bobby McFerrin with Yo-Yo Ma and Chick Corea, was undone by its length, repetitiveness and generally purposeless-looking movement. The program was completed by Ms. Muller's moody 1973 ''Winter Pieces,'' whose stylish dull-colored fatigues, designed by Karen Small and Stageworks, won the costuming honors of the evening.</p>
        <p>Dances by the Muller alumni Christopher Pilafian, Leonardo Smith and Leda Meredith will be presented, with new and recent work by Ms. Muller, on a second program to be performed tomorrow night and Sunday night at the Joyce, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea.  DANCE REVIEW</p>
