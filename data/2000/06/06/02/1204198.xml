        <p>Just after the Knicks lost Game 5 Wednesday night, the door to the locker room swung open. Slumped forward in a chair, his face weary from exhaustion, Patrick Ewing was decorated in ice bags.</p>
        <p>He was a vision of valor, but also a figure cursed by longevity. At 37, Ewing's aching body has the dents and rust of an appliance placed curbside even as he continues to push forward. As he nears the end of his 15th season with the Knicks, he has wealth and an historic place, but his extended stay in this city has yet to turn up a title or public affection.</p>
        <p>''I think the legacy has already been written for Patrick here,'' Coach Jeff Van Gundy said today after practice. ''He is the best Knick ever, but he's not the most popular one.''</p>
        <p>He limps, but he is not Willis Reed. Today, on the eve of Game 6 at Madison Square Garden, with his team one game from elimination, down three games to two to Indiana, Ewing was forced to confront an issue that has only cemented his status as a tragic figure: are the Knicks better without him? Just the question must sting even the callous skin Ewing has developed over the years.</p>
        <p>''I'm used to it,'' said Ewing, who expects to play in Game 6 after his Game 5 comeback from a two-game absence because of tendinitis in his right foot. ''I don't worry about it. I'm hurt. But I feel like I can step on the court and help the team. I've got to come out and try to play.''</p>
        <p>And play effectively -- or else the season could end. The Knicks are in a dire situation, similar to the one they were in when they fell behind Miami, three games to two, in the conference semifinals.</p>
        <p>''I think the biggest difference is, Indiana's a better team'' than Miami, Van Gundy said. ''Again, we have to find a way to play one great home game to get the season down to one game back there in Indiana. That's all we should be thinking about, making the necessary corrections to be ready mentally and physically.''</p>
        <p>They were at their prepared best against Miami. In that series, Ewing came through with critical free throws and timely offense to help remove the team from harm's way. But the Heat series seems so long ago.</p>
        <p>This past week, Ewing's teammates seem to have had their consciousness pierced by the repeated quote of a glaring statistic: over the last two years in the playoffs, the Knicks are 5-1 without Ewing against Indiana. Privately, one player uttered his frustration with the way the pace of Game 5 bogged down once the offense started to go through Ewing. It was certainly not his fault, but an 18-point Knicks lead in the second quarter began to vanish once Ewing, among others, began lofting up jumpers.</p>
        <p>''We did nothing better in the first quarter other than we made shots,'' Van Gundy said. ''We didn't guard any better. We didn't rebound better. We didn't make hustle plays. It's fool's gold thinking you're going to shoot your way to a win.''</p>
        <p>In Games 3 and 4, the Knicks were a penetrating team that created open shots. And they also rebounded, which they didn't do with a bigger lineup in Game 5. This lack of aggressiveness with Ewing on the floor in Game 5 puzzled Latrell Sprewell, for one. Was it Ewing, the Pacers' assertiveness, or something else?</p>
        <p>''I don't know if that's the case or not, with Patrick on the floor, whether we're better or not,'' Sprewell said today. ''I just don't know. I feel in my heart that we need Patrick and need him to play well.</p>
        <p>''If you look just at the numbers, the numbers definitely say we're better without him. We've won 5 and lost 1 without him. If you look at that, that's probably the case. That's what the numbers say.''</p>
        <p>One year ago, Ewing partly tore his Achilles' tendon against Indiana during Game 2 of the conference finals and missed the rest of the playoffs. In his absence, a liberated Knicks team used an up-tempo style as it went to the National Basketball Association finals. With a boot cast on his foot, and despair in his mood, Ewing watched from the bench in a suit.</p>
        <p>Last week, the scene was revisited when Ewing pulled up six minutes into Game 2. Unlike last year, Ewing is back -- whether his teammates welcome it or not.</p>
        <p>''At this point of the year, to me, it's an overanalyzed issue,'' Van Gundy said. ''We had no problem winning with Patrick on the floor against Miami. And this has nothing to do with Latrell, but when you lose at this time of the year, when the stakes are higher, there's not enough reflection on what each person can do differently by the individual. And there's more reflection on what others should be doing..</p>
        <p>''Face it, the players have been asked about it so often. Once you've been given this stat all the time, you start to believe it a little. I don't think our strong-willed guys will believe it.''</p>
