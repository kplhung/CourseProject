        <p>Dinosaur  With the voices of D. B. Sweeney, Alfre Woodard, Ossie Davis, Joan Plowright, Max Casella, Hayden Panettiere, Samuel E. Wright, Julianna Margulies, Peter Siragusa, Della Reese  Directed by Ralph Zondag and Eric Leighton  PG 90 minutes</p>
        <p>Gripping a stolen iguanadon egg in its beak, a computer-generated pterodactyl soars between peaks and over bottomless chasms. What follows owes much to Steven Spielberg and Charles Darwin. First, though, comes a serving of Tarzan when the egg plops into the jungle and the hatchling within is reared by a family of lemurs to become a sweet-  natured creature, Aladar (Mr. Sweeney), several thousand times the size they are.</p>
        <p>Devoted to his adoptive family, Aladar still longs for something bigger. Before long opportunity arrives in a meteor shower and nuclear-style explosion. In a Disney film that is not a species-killer, but it does put everybody on the road with a parade of dinosaurs struggling to reach their Elysian nesting grounds, which lie a torturous desert or two beyond.</p>
        <p>Mesozoic critters of every description are strung out in the long migration. The biggest is a dowager brachiosaur named Baylene (Ms. Plowright). Eema (Ms. Reese), a weary and testy old styrachosaur, is more armor-plated, but she and Baylene move slowly, which leaves them vulnerable to the toothy little raptors trailing the procession like a Cretaceous pack of dingos.</p>
        <p>But even the most vigorous could become the next meal of two giant carnotaurs, or T. rexes, who shake the ground and bring on lightning bolts. Eema and Baylene traipse on through scorching, waterless days but constantly fall behind. That's their problem, according to Kron (Mr. Wright), the leader of the procession, who has beaten Darwin to the idea that survival belongs to the fittest. Fortunately, Aladar has a more enlightened view.</p>
        <p>VIOLENCE The carnotaurs, big and as mean as they make them, chow down on some central characters and continually threaten to pull tasty morsels out of caves and rock piles where their prey clings for dear life. Later on Kron's stubborn belligerence leads to a brawl with Aladar.</p>
        <p>SEX None.</p>
        <p>PROFANITY None.</p>
        <p>For Which Children?</p>
        <p>AGES 3-7 Parents know their littlest ones, but some children will be frightened by the mayhem and upset by the deaths.</p>
        <p>AGES 8 AND UP The computerized action placed in real settings is often quite spectacular. Most children will be engrossed.</p>
        <p>M:I-2  Tom Cruise, Thandie Newton, Dougray Scott, Richard Roxburgh, Ving Rhames, Rade Sherbedgia  Directed by John Woo  PG-13 120 minutes</p>
        <p>On the airliner headed for Atlanta, the very nervous Dr. Nekhorvich (Mr. Sherbedgia) tells Dimitri, who looks and sounds exactly like Tom Cruise, that he feels better having him along on the trip.</p>
        <p>The doctor has elected to transport a lethal virus called Chimera by injecting himself with it and then racing to reach the antidote before he dies. That shows a whole lot more faith in airline schedules than most people would have in Nekhorvich's shoes, but it is academic really because the plane's next stop is into the side of a mountain. And as it evolves, Dimitri is not Dimitri or even Mr. Cruise. Peeling off a latex mask -- a lot of which are worn in this movie -- he becomes Hugh Stamp (Mr. Roxburgh).</p>
        <p>From here the film gets trickier than the punctuation in its title. Stamp works for Sean Ambrose (Mr. Scott), an Australian psychopath who needs control of the virus to swell his pharmaceuticals portfolio (priorities being what they are these days). Mr. Cruise portrays the agent Ethan Hunt, assigned to get the stuff back in responsible hands.</p>
        <p>Mission: impossible. Might as well give it the old college try, though, and to help out Hunt signs on a lovely thief named Nyah (Ms. Newton), who was once involved with Ambrose and is now counted upon to inflitrate her former boyfriend's fortified oceanside compound.</p>
        <p>Hunt does not help himself by falling in love with Nyah, which clouds his focus. Luckily it does not impede his prowess as an aerialist during a 42nd-floor laboratory break-in or his survival in the resulting battles by fireball, knife, gun and karate.</p>
        <p>VIOLENCE In a John Woo film, virtually nonstop killing and fighting is graphic but performed in such a stylized manner that violence often seems unreal if not cornball. (Why does Hunt do those backflips before landing a blow?)</p>
        <p>SEX Hunt and Nyah repair to the boudoir, but sexually these two make an arid pair in a perfunctory cut-to-morning session fit for a PG-13.</p>
        <p>PROFANITY A few expletives.</p>
        <p>For Which Children?</p>
        <p>UNDER AGE 11 Most parents obviously will not troop the youngest into this kind of entertainment, but by age 9 or 10, depending on individual guidelines, there are decisions to be made. Stylization aside, the film is very violent.</p>
        <p>AGES 11 AND UP Think you can stop them?</p>
        <p>Road Trip  Breckin Meyer, Seann William Scott, Amy Smart, Tom Green, DJ Qualls, Paulo Costanzo, Rachel Blanchard, Fred Ward, Mia Amber Davis  Directed by Todd Phillips  R 91 minutes</p>
        <p>Sure, it sounds trashy and dumb, but try to get through this movie without laughing. At Ithaca College, young Josh (Mr. Meyer) pines for his childhood sweetheart, Tiffany (Ms. Blanchard), who is at veterinary school in Austin, Tex. One evening Josh is seduced and has sex with Beth (Ms. Smart), who decides it would be cute to videotape everything. Tapes get switched. Instead of a cassette with Josh strumming a guitar, Tiffany is sent one with Josh in flagrante delicto.</p>
        <p>Josh and friends pile into a car owned by Kyle (Mr. Qualls) and drive cross-country to intercept the mail. Left back in Ithaca to feed Josh's python, Barry (Mr. Green) toys with a condemned mouse and, having mistaken Austin for Boston, sends Beth, who is feeling betrayed, to the wrong city on a mission of revenge.</p>
        <p>On their way to the Lone Star State, the boys wreck Kyle's car, steal a bus, have a disgusting experience with French toast and learn a new procedure as donors in a sperm bank. The scrawny Kyle has a successful sexual initiation with the ample Rhonda (Ms. Davis). After a riot in an Austin mailroom, they drive home. Oh, and on the trip Josh is tutored in philosophy. Later he passes his test and he and Beth sell their tapes on eBay.</p>
        <p>VIOLENCE The snake never harms the mouse, but on his son's trail Kyle's father (Mr. Ward) assaults people, including Kyle.</p>
        <p>SEX There is some nudity, and sex acts are performed, albeit in clearly simulated fashion.</p>
        <p>PROFANITY There are obscenities and much vulgar talk.</p>
        <p>For Which Children?</p>
        <p>UNDER AGE 14 Older children would laugh their heads off, but attendance is not the greatest idea.</p>
        <p>AGES 14-17 Mr. Green is the main draw in a silly, raunchy and occasionally very funny movie that, besides being a teenage natural, is in many ways the successor to the enormously popular ''There's Something About Mary.''</p>
