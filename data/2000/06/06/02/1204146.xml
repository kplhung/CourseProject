        <p>Editorial holds that Miami relatives should accept Appeals Court ruling and not drag out bitter battle over Elian Gonzalez; says courts should wrap up any remaining appeals requests and federal authorities should begin preparations to allow Elian and his family to go home</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>A three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit has issued a sound ruling that takes an important step toward bringing the Elian Gonzalez case to a proper and just conclusion. The court ruled that the Immigration and Naturalization Service was within its legal authority when it said that the young boy rescued off the Florida coast last November cannot seek asylum on his own, and that only his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, can speak for him. Mr. Gonzalez has said he wants to take his child home to Cuba.</p>
        <p>Given the appeals court decision, the boy's Miami relatives, who have been fighting to keep Elian in the United States, should accept the reality that he belongs with his father. The relatives are entitled to ask for a re-hearing, but otherwise there is very little legal basis for dragging out this bitter and destructive case further. The case has already done damage to the image of the Cuban-American community in Miami and subjected a young child to a long sojourn away from home after the death of his mother at sea. Elian has now spent more than a month living with his father, stepmother and half-brother in the Washington area while awaiting the appellate court decision.</p>

        <p>A three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit has issued a sound ruling that takes an important step toward bringing the Elian Gonzalez case to a proper and just conclusion. The court ruled that the Immigration and Naturalization Service was within its legal authority when it said that the young boy rescued off the Florida coast last November cannot seek asylum on his own, and that only his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, can speak for him. Mr. Gonzalez has said he wants to take his child home to Cuba.</p>
        <p>Given the appeals court decision, the boy's Miami relatives, who have been fighting to keep Elian in the United States, should accept the reality that he belongs with his father. The relatives are entitled to ask for a re-hearing, but otherwise there is very little legal basis for dragging out this bitter and destructive case further. The case has already done damage to the image of the Cuban-American community in Miami and subjected a young child to a long sojourn away from home after the death of his mother at sea. Elian has now spent more than a month living with his father, stepmother and half-brother in the Washington area while awaiting the appellate court decision.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's decision affirms the judgment that was issued in March by Federal District Court Judge K. Michael Moore, and upholds the decisions of Attorney General Janet Reno and the I.N.S. commissioner in affirming the father's parental rights. Although this page condemned the pre-dawn raid on the Miami relatives' residence on April 22 as a matter of law enforcement tactics, the relatives cannot now argue that they have not had their day in court.</p>
        <p>The appellate court found that the I.N.S.'s decision that a 6-year-old child must be represented by an adult in asylum proceedings, and that only a parent may speak for the child, absent evidence of a clear conflict between the parent and the child, was ''reasoned and reasonable.'' Moreover, the court found that Congress left the details of the asylum process to the discretion of the executive branch, and that the authority of the executive branch to fill in the policy details is especially great in the immigration area.</p>
        <p>The court has given Elian's Miami relatives 14 days to request that the case be reheard by the full appeals court. It appears that Elian will be required to remain in the country for at least that period. Lawyers for the relatives are also seeking intervention by the Supreme Court to ensure that Elian will remain in the United States until that court can consider an appeal.</p>
        <p>But the Miami relatives should recognize that even if Elian were allowed to apply for asylum on his own, it is highly unlikely that his claim would be granted. Indeed, the I.N.S. has already made a preliminary assessment that his claim would probably lack merit because he would have to show a ''well-founded fear of persecution'' in his home country, a difficult standard to meet.</p>
        <p>The courts should wrap up any remaining appeals requests as quickly as possible. It is time for the federal authorities to begin preparations to allow Elian and his family to go home.</p>
