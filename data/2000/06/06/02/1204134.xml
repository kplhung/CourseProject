        <p>Ivana Trump confided to him her anxiety about pimples and skin rashes. Courtney Love told him how she used her breasts as a political statement. Sharon Stone told him how she loved to torment men.</p>
        <p>Those were just a handful of the intimate celebrity interviews that made Tom Kummer one of the hottest young journalists in Germany.</p>
        <p>Writing for a number of German magazines from Los Angeles, the brash 37-year-old writer from Switzerland mesmerized editors here with what seemed to be an unparalleled entree to America's biggest stars.</p>
        <p>While most other foreign journalists in Hollywood grumbled about being last in line for even rigidly controlled 15-minute interviews, Mr. Kummer claimed to have befriended many stars and even to have worked out with them in the same gyms.</p>
        <p>There was only one problem: many of his interviews never took place. Most, published in the magazine of the Munich newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung, were cobbled together from material published elsewhere. Some appear to have been entirely fabricated.</p>
        <p>In a scathing report on Saturday, accompanied by an apology to readers, the newspaper concluded that many of Mr. Kummer's interviews in its magazine ''had obviously not taken place'' and had been ''falsified.''  On Tuesday, it fired the magazine's two top editors, Christian Kammerling and Ulf Poschardt.</p>
        <p>It was more than just an embarrassment. Suddeutsche Zeitung is one of Germany's most respected newspapers and has won widespread praise for aggressive reporting on the finance scandals surrounding former Chancellor Helmut Kohl.</p>
        <p>The incident also sheds light on the  grip of American popular culture. Thanks to satellite broadcasting, the Internet and ever better techniques for dubbing, Hollywood has never seemed as close to home. But the reality is that foreign journalists get very short shrift from the industry's public relations machine. Access to movie stars is dished out to those journalists most likely to increase sales, and those are mostly the big American news organizations.</p>
        <p>''My bosses got mad at me, asking me why I couldn't get the kind of interviews that Kummer was getting,'' recalled Claus Lutterbeck, who worked in Hollywood for Stern magazine. Stern was so taken by Mr. Kummer that it briefly hired him in 1995 and transferred Mr. Lutterbeck to Washington.</p>
        <p>In its own report, Suddeutsche Zeitung said the editors of its magazine ignored widespread suspicions about Mr. Kummer, as well his firing from another magazine in 1990 for fabricating an article.</p>
        <p>In April 1999, the magazine cut its ties to Mr. Kummer after editors became convinced that he was fabricating material once again. But they never told readers until a competitor, the magazine Focus, published allegations about him two weeks ago.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kummer, unrepentant, has admitted using material from different sources to create what looked like one-on-one interviews. He also argues that magazine editors knew and approved of his methods.</p>
        <p>In a recent interview with the German magazine Spiegel, he belittled questions about the authenticity as ''too one-dimensional for me.''</p>
        <p>Praised by editors for his wit and  efficiency, Mr. Kummer sold articles to Stern, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung and the magazine of Zurich's Tagesanzeiger.</p>
        <p>Over the last five years, he published ''exclusive'' interviews with singers, actors and celebrities like Whitney Houston, Brad Pitt, Sharon Stone, Kim Basinger, and Ivana Trump, the ex-wife of the New York real estate tycoon Donald Trump. Spokesmen for Ms. Stone, Ms. Basinger and Courtney Love have all denied that any interviews took place, Focus reported.</p>
        <p>Suddeutsche's magazine published the interview with Courtney Love in late 1996. In it, Ms. Love supposedly told Mr. Kummer: ''I play with my breasts, not to show off but to demonstrate a kind of revulsion. I simply transform myself into a voice for all the tormented souls of this world.''</p>
        <p>But according to Suddeutsche Zeitung, Mr. Kummer had expressed this thought himself in an article nearly two years earlier in the Swiss newspaper Weltwoche, writing: ''She plays with her breasts not to show off but to demonstrate revulsion. She wants to embody the voice of all tormented souls in the world.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most bizarre case was his cover story on Ivana Trump in April 1999. Not only did the described interview never take place, he inserted thoughts from ''The Philosophy of Andy Warhol'' and inserted them into her mouth. ''There may be no great mishap in life than skin problems,'' he quoted her as saying. ''Pimples are not really a problem. They come and they go. Skin irritations are much worse. It can only get worse when you're turned down by a famous skin clinic.''</p>
        <p>Catherine Saxton, a spokeswoman for Ms. Trump, said Ms. Trump never remembered any interview at all with Mr. Kummer and did not even know about the cover story.</p>
        <p>''We have looked through our calendar and cannot find any record of a meeting with him,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Even after publishing its own investigation, the Suddeutsche Zeitung was unable to explain how an obscure freelance writer could carry on a deception involving world celebrities for nearly five years.</p>
        <p>Before being fired as co-editor of the Suddeutsche's magazine, Mr. Poschardt told his superiors he thought that Mr. Kummer had been ''rehabilitated'' and had learned from his past mistakes.</p>
        <p>But Stern's publisher, Werner Funk, said he cut the ties with Mr. Kummer after his first interview because editors were convinced he was trying to sell them a fabricated interview with the actress Christina Ricci. Referring to Mr. Kummer and his editors at the Suddeutsche magazine, Mr. Funk said ''they appeared to have a different idea of journalism.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Lutterbeck, now Stern's Washington correspondent, said many German editors were vulnerable to falling into the same trap.</p>
        <p>''The problem is that no one, not even our bosses, knows how Hollywood really works,'' Mr. Lutterbeck said. ''They don't know how hard it is to get any access at all. They think we spend our time at cocktail parties with movie stars. So someone like Kummer can come along and they have no control over him.''</p>
