        <p>The Devils acquired Alexander Mogilny from Vancouver hours before the trading deadline in March for the same reason they traded for Claude Lemieux and Vladimir Malakhov earlier this season: to win a Stanley Cup.</p>
        <p>Mogilny was one of the few Devils who produced tonight, scoring New Jersey's lone goal in a 2-1 loss to the Dallas Stars. It was his fourth goal of the playoffs.</p>
        <p>''Scoring doesn't matter when you lose,'' he said in a whisper. ''I feel about scoring, but it wasn't enough. We didn't play well and we have to do better. The main difference in this game was that they played positional hockey.''</p>
        <p>The speedy and elusive Mogilny, who scored the game-winner in Game 6 against the Philadelphia Flyers in the Eastern Conference finals, was just one of a handful of Devils who stuck with Coach Larry Robinson's game plan tonight.</p>
        <p>The usually mild-mannered Robinson did not resort to a tirade, as he did after his Devils fell behind to the Flyers by three games to one in the previous series.</p>
        <p>''This is only 1-1,'' Robinson said. ''This is not the end of the world and it's not the time to panic. The thing was that our decisions with the puck were poor. We didn't play well and we'll have to play better when we go into their building.''</p>
        <p>What hurt the Devils most were turnovers in the neutral zone that allowed the Stars to use their effective transition game. Turnovers by the Devils resulted in both Dallas goals.</p>
        <p>''There was some frustration,'' Scott Stevens said, ''because a lot of our guys played as individuals. We talked about getting it deep and avoid turnovers, but we didn't do it.''</p>
        <p>Stevens started the play that resulted in Mogilny's goal with a good move in his zone and a lead pass to the rookie center Scott Gomez. Gomez controlled the puck with help from his skates and his stick to carry it into the attacking zone.</p>
        <p>The 31-year-old Mogilny made no mistake after taking the pass from Gomez, during a four-on-four situation. He wristed a ferocious shot from the slot that beat Ed Belfour over the glove side 11 minutes 42 seconds into the game. It was Gomez's first point in the last seven games.</p>
        <p>In five seasons with Vancouver, Mogilny never reached the postseason and, of course, was happy to join the Devils and have a chance at hockey's ultimate prize. He has performed effectively in the playoffs, but this was the night he played with gusto from beginning to end.</p>
        <p>The Devils took three penalties in the opening period after taking none in the opening game of the series. Only one of the penalties resulted in a Dallas power play, however, and the Devils kept the Stars without a shot during the advantage.</p>
        <p>The Devils limited the Stars to just three shots in the first period, while they had nine attempts at Belfour, who looked much stronger tonight after allowing 6 goals on 18 shots in the first game of the series, when he revealed that he was taking medication for a cold that caused him to lose energy.</p>
        <p>Each team had a great chance in the early stages of the second period to break the tie, when Kirk Muller of the Stars hit the left post from the right circle and Randy McKay was denied by Belfour in his crease. As a result, the two teams were tied going into the third period.</p>
        <p>McKay was one of the Devils who echoed Robinson's claim that the team reverted from its game plan at times, turning the puck over to the Stars.</p>
        <p>''The coach told us to keep it deep in their zone and try to forecheck, but we tried to be a little creative in the neutral zone and it cost us,'' McKay said.</p>
