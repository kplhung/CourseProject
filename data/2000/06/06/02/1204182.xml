        <p>When the Knicks' practice ended today, the doors to the gym opened, and scattered around the court were hobbled players with ice packs strapped to their appendages and electric-stimulation machines wired to their aching bones.</p>
        <p>Only one thing seemed at full strength: the Knicks' continued willingness to engage in bravado.</p>
        <p>Patrick Ewing was assuring anyone who would listen that the Knicks would triumph in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference finals Friday night and even the four-of-seven-game series in the Eastern Conference finals.</p>
        <p>Chris Childs echoed the prediction that he made when the Knicks faced a similar situation against the Miami Heat in their previous series. He boldly guaranteed that the Knicks would play their best game of the year Friday and would be back in Indiana for Game 7 on Sunday.</p>
        <p>The injuries -- to Ewing, who missed Games 3 and 4 of this series with tendinitis in his foot; to Latrell Sprewell, who has a partly fractured toe; to Marcus Camby, who has a sprained knee; and to Larry Johnson, who has plantar fasciitis in one foot -- have clearly had an impact on the team. But how much is unclear.</p>
        <p>Before the start of Game 5 in Indianapolis on Wednesday, the Knicks even handed out a sheet of paper detailing all the injuries and the players' uncertain status, although all of them went on to play.</p>
        <p>The Knicks don't usually hand out such information. So it seemed as if the team was either trying to provide an early reason for a possible defeat in Game 5 or, more likely, trying to make the players feel that everyone and everything was going against them and that they would need a great effort to beat the odds and the Pacers.</p>
        <p>The great effort was there for one quarter. And then an 18-point lead was gone before halftime, and the Knicks went on to lose, 88-79.</p>
        <p>Did the injuries play a factor in the Knicks' collapse?</p>
        <p>''To be honest, what happened to us is we just didn't play hard,'' Sprewell said. ''Looking at that tape is so disappointing, to see that type of effort that we gave defensively and knowing how good we can be defensively. I can't speak for the other guys, but I know I was disappointed.''</p>
        <p>Sprewell, Ewing, Johnson and Camby all took part today in a light workout and all are expected to play Friday. Actually, some of their teammates are banged up almost as much. Allan Houston still sports an ice pack on the ankle he rolled in Game 6 against the Heat, and Childs's knee is still aching from a bruise he sustained in Game 2 of this series. It is a fact of life that at this point in the season, if you are still playing, you are doing it in pain.</p>
        <p>''The teams that are left playing are the mentally strong teams that are able to play with those injuries,'' Childs said. ''Injuries affect you in different ways. If you don't have your legs, you're not going to hit your shots, but there's other things you can do.''</p>
        <p>Knicks Coach Jeff Van Gundy, when asked about Sprewell's 10-point performance in Game 5, acknowledged that Sprewell might not be at his best right now, but said: ''We don't need his best. We just need whatever he can give to us. I don't want there to be any sense of discouragement about what they can't do individually, but enthusiasm for whatever they can give us.''</p>
        <p>Sprewell has said from the moment he injured his foot in Game 3 that he would play through the pain, and he reiterated that sentiment today. But he also acknowledged that the injury was hampering his play, although his playoff performances were inconsistent even before his foot was hurt.</p>
        <p>''It's the same as the last couple of days,'' he said. ''It's sore, but I've got to play and I've got to play better.''  Like Sprewell, the other injured Knicks did not look for excuses today. Instead, they tried to focus on the task at hand.</p>
        <p>''If we lose tomorrow we go on vacation,'' Ewing said. ''But this team thrives on adversity. That's the way it's been since I have been here. We have never done anything the easy way. I guess it is just going to have to be one of those type of series for us. We are going to win tomorrow and come back on Sunday and try to win that, also.''</p>
        <p>Childs said: ''I guarantee we'll go back to Indiana. I guarantee we're going back, because I know we're going to play better and we're going to come out and play the best game we've played all year. Everybody that's involved in the game is going to play their best game.''</p>
        <p>Maybe even the ones who are playing hurt.</p>
        <p>REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>LATRELL SPREWELL said the Knicks would take a much more aggressive tack in Game 6. ''Get yourself ready to bang and get bruised up,'' he said. ''We're going to take some fouls tomorrow. Not flagrant fouls, but we're going to be hitting guys.''</p>
