        <p>I recently read a newspaper article about a Vermont farmer who has found a way to make his unprofitable family farm profitable. He sold his milk cows and started leading tours of the farm, obligingly chewing on pieces of hay for photographs. ''The simple old life is gone,'' the farmer was quoted as saying. ''It don't fit in today's world. Our crop is fleecing the city folks.''</p>
        <p>The president of CBS, Leslie Moonves, couldn't have said it better. Like the Vermont farmer, Mr. Moonves has cast his lot with pseudoreality and brought us city folks ''Survivor,'' whose first episode was broadcast on Wednesday night.</p>
        <p>As you must have heard, ''Survivor'' is a ''reality'' game show in which 16 men and women are stranded on an island in the South China Sea, with a television crew to record their travails. (Travails, of course, are crucial to the enterprise -- otherwise, why watch?) Their 39 days on Pulau Tiga have been compressed into 13 one-hour episodes. Just in case nature did not produce enough dramatic tension, the producers built in a guarantee: At the end of each show, the ''castaways'' meet and vote to expel one person (but not the camera crew, of course) from the island. The survivor wins $1 million.</p>
        <p>The advance publicity tantalized with talk of the island dwellers' eating rats, possible romantic liaisons and the potential cruelty in this hyper-Darwinism. That was enough to prompt ABC to move a broadcast of its big gun, ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' opposite ''Survivor'' the night of its debut.</p>
        <p>The prospect of ''Survivor's'' unabashed tackiness generated much commentary: Are we a nation of pathetic voyeurs? (Make that a world of pathetic voyeurs. ''Survivor'' was inspired by a highly-rated Swedish program called ''Expedition: Robinson.'') Have we completely erased the line between real and unreal? As if this question has relevance in the realm of network televison.</p>
        <p>Everyone can relax. The first episode of ''Survivor'' felt closer in spirit to a summer camp color war than ''Lord of the Flies,'' with the master of ceremonies, Jeff Probst, acting as Uncle Jeff, kindly camp director. The cute and comforting Mr. Probst, an experienced host (of VH1's ''Rock and Roll Jeopardy''), appears periodically to explain the rules and to offer encouragement, even to the lousy campers.</p>
        <p>Mark Burnett, the producer, was responsible for the ''Eco Challenge'' series on the Discovery Channel. He has brought to ''Survivor'' the earnest, nature-boy ethos of a Discovery show, but with no pretense of higher purpose. So far almost nothing has been imparted about the natural life of the island, except for ominous and unexplained shots of snakes and rats (none of which have been eaten yet).</p>
        <p>However, there is much exposition on the mechanics of ''Survivor'': how the group is actually divided into an orange team (the Tagi tribe) and a yellow (Pagong). How every three days they compete in a contest. How the losers have to eject someone from their team from the island. The contestants themselves often refer to their strategies for winning.</p>
        <p>In the style of a cheesy disaster movie, ''Survivor'' first establishes the characters, who are deliberately motley -- a foxy woman lawyer, a handsome male doctor with a pierced nipple, an annoying, fleshy corporate guy and a cranky retired Navy SEAL who says things like ''I'm used to the military; no back talk.'' They were not assembled casually. The producers say they culled them from more than 6,000 applications. This may be a reality show, but it has been designed as carefully as make-believe. (There's diversity in age, sex, and ethnicity, as well as a core of men and women who look good in bathing suits.)</p>
        <p>To be sure, people were curious, and standards clearly are not high. ''Survivor'' drew an audience of 15,579,000, not as much as ''Millionaire'' (with 16,578,000), but enough to give the ABC megahit real competition; ''Millionaire'' had a much bigger audience the night before, 22,280,000.</p>
        <p>Revelation and exploitation may be on tap in later episodes (or audiences may simply have to wait until July for ''Big Brother,'' another CBS reality show putting strangers together under many camera lenses,  this time in a house). The conflict in this first ''Survivor'' was mild -- some sniping over whether to build the latrine first or to clear a sleeping area, one of the older men complaining about the ''lazy people.'' Another says dramatically, ''If we don't keep some humor, we'll go mad.'' (This at the end of the first day!)</p>
        <p>Finally, a big argument breaks out among the Panong. Who is going to start the fire? The dispute is resolved; the fire is lighted.</p>
        <p>The Tagi group is more cooperative but cannot ignite a fire, no matter how hard they rub pieces of wood together. Sean, the pierced doctor, says sadly: ''We made a lot of smoke but no fire.'' That's a fair summary of ''Survivor.''</p>
        <p>Castaways, Ahoy</p>
        <p>Nick at Nite has capitalized on the ''Survivor'' publicity blitz by rolling out its newly acquired library of ''Gilligan's Island'' in a weeklong blitz, which the cable network has slyly packaged as ''The Survivors' Guide.'' Beginning Sunday night at 9, viewers can study the resourcefulness of seven sitcom castaways. No reality here: just Gilligan, the Skipper too, the millionaire and his wife, the movie star, the professor and Mary Ann.</p>
