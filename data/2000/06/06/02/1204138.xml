        <p>Tito Puente recorded almost 120 albums over more than 50 years. Here is a selection of some of his best work, including his vital dance music.</p>
        <p>PETER WATROUS</p>
        <p>CUBAN CARNIVAL  (RCA). A cross between Ellingtonian orchestration and Latin percussion. Considered one of Mr. Puente's masterpieces. Recorded in 1955 and 1956.</p>
        <p>DANCE MANIA,  Vol. 1 and 2 (RCA). From 1958, orchestral dance music at the highest possible level, with Santitos Colon singing.</p>
        <p>TOP PERCUSSION  (RCA). A trip into Afro-Cuban religious and secular music, using mostly percussion.</p>
        <p>MAMBORAMA  (Tico). An instrumental album of mambos from 1959, with Mr. Puente playing vibraphone and showing off some of his more modern jazz arrangements.</p>
        <p>VAYA PUENTE  (Tico). Tough dance music from 1962.</p>
        <p>TITO PUENTE SINGS THE EXCITING LA LUPE SWINGS  (Tico). Rocking early salsa with one of the better singers of the time.</p>
        <p>HOMENAJE A BENY  (Tico). A three-CD set recorded in the late 1970's, featuring a series of salsa's best singers, including Celia Cruz, Hector Lavoe and Adalberto Santiago performing the music of Beny More.</p>
        <p>THE LEGEND  (Tico). An example of the modern orchestral dance music Mr. Puente was working on in the late 1970's.</p>
        <p>ROYAL T  (Concord). A late classic of relaxed Latin jazz, from 1993.</p>
        <p>TITO'S IDEA  (RMM/TropiJazz). A jazz orchestral album from the mid-1990's that features tunes like ''Woody 'n' You'' and ''Nica's Tempo.''</p>
        <p>TITO PUENTE LIVE AT BIRDLAND DANCEMANIA '99  (RMM). A hard-core dance album that reflects Mr. Puente's band-leading precision; it won a Grammy.</p>
