        <p>Girl, Interrupted</p>
        <p>After washing down a bottle of aspirin with a bottle of vodka, Susanna (Winona Ryder, left) is sent off to Claymoore psychiatric hospital. It is the 1960's and Susanna, perhaps a little too smart for her own good, talks about mystical undertow, but basically her problems are a neurotic peevishness and a need to grow up. Or, as a nurse (Whoopi Goldberg) puts it, ''You're a lazy, self-indulgent little girl who is driving herself crazy.'' At Claymoore, Susanna falls in with the house insurgent (Angelina Jolie) but then starts to calm down in, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times, ''a small, intense period piece with a hardheaded tough-love attitude.''</p>
        <p>1999. Columbia Tri-Star. $107.37; DVD, $24.95. 127 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release date: June 6.</p>

        <p>Mr. Death</p>
        <p>In Errol Morris's documentary, subtitled ''The Rise and Fall of Fred A. Leuchter Jr.,'' a mousy, mild-mannered Boston-born builder of execution devices gets illusions of omniscience when his cockeyed notions are adopted by Holocaust deniers. Sent by them to Auschwitz in 1988, Mr. Leuchter furtively chips masonry from rooms once used as gas chambers at Auschwitz. Finding no residue of cyanide, he concludes that there were no gas executions at the camp. That makes him a fixture of the neo-Nazi lecture circuit in Europe, but here he makes creepy company in ''the best comedy-horror documentary about the Holocaust ever made'' (Holden).</p>
        <p>1999. Universal. $107.37. 91 minutes. PG-13. Release date: June 6.</p>
        <p>The Eel</p>
        <p>After murdering his wife and her lover, a seeming model of Japanese conformity named Yamashita (Koji Yakusho) pedals to the police station and surrenders. Eight years later he is released in the custody of a Buddhist priest and begins a new life on a remote stretch of coast. There he meets Keiko (Misa Shimuzu), who bears an uncanny resemblance to his wife and awakens all the old issues of jealousy, rage, remorse and guilt. Directed by Shohei Imamura, ''Mr. Yakusho and Ms. Shimizu deliver unerring performances in a splendid film that harvests hope from a bleak landscape'' (Lawrence Van Gelder).</p>
        <p>1998. New Yorker. $95. 117 minutes. Japanese with English subtitles. No rating. Release date: June 6.</p>
        <p>Next Friday</p>
        <p>A loud, low-level sequel to the 1995 comedy ''Friday'' sends Craig (Ice Cube, who wrote and produced this film) from South Los Angeles to the suburbs, where he will presumably get a respite from big-city violence. But out in Rancho Cucamonga all is not bucolic, what with the gangster Joker boys flashing automatic weapons across the street, their pit bull, Chico, assaulting the neighbors, and Craig's cousin Day-Day (Mike Epps) battling his pregnant girlfriend, D'Wana (Tamala Jones). In other words, don't expect surprises in a film ''notable chiefly for feeding a stereotype of blacks as shiftless layabouts interested mainly in recreational drugs and irresponsible sex'' (Van Gelder).</p>
        <p>1999. New Line. $109.37; DVD, $24.98. 100 minutes. Closed captioned. Release date: June 6.</p>
        <p>Straight to Video</p>
        <p>Other new titles of interest, some of which may have had a theater release, appeared on television or been on videocassette in earlier editions.</p>
        <p>A SCANDAL IN PARIS. George Sanders is the French thief Francois Eugene Vido in Douglas Sirk's film, also known as  ''Thieves' Holiday,'' about a young rogue who was born in prison and spends much of his youth there, takes a phony commission in Napoleon's army to escape further indictments and eventually becomes the police chief of Paris. 1946. Kino. VHS, $24.95. 100 minutes. Release date: June 6.</p>
        <p>SEX AND THE CITY. Here is the whole first season of the HBO series, based on Candace Bushnell's book, starring Sarah Jessica Parker as a sex columnist who gets much of her material from her own experiences and those of her friends (Kim Cattrall, Kristin Davis and Cynthia Nixon). 1999. HBO. VHS, $39.92; DVD, $39.99. 300 minutes.</p>
        <p>STELLA, A MATTER OF DIGNITY, ATTILA 74, A GIRL IN BLACK. Four films by the Greek director Michael Cacoyannis (''Electra,'' ''Zorba the Greek'') are on cassette and DVD from Fox Lorber. In ''Stella'' (1955, 92 minutes), a Golden Globe winner, Melina Mercouri stars as a woman with too many men friends for her own good. In ''A Matter of Dignity'' (1958, 101 minutes), a self-centered mother pushes her daughter at a suitor with money and battles with her impoverished maid. Mr. Cacoyannis's only documentary, ''Attila 74'' (1975, 101 minutes), explores the cost of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. In ''A Girl in Black'' (1956, 101 minutes), a young woman fights for her reputation and a solid relationship on a small Greek island. VHS, $19.98 each; DVD, $29.98 each. Greek with English subtitles.</p>
