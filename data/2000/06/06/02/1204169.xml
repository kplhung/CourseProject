        <p>The Giuliani administration and City Council leaders are close to reaching an accord on a $37 billion budget for the 2001 fiscal year, although the proposed settlement could still be disrupted by state legislators in Albany, who might add as much as $1 billion in extra expenses, city officials said.</p>
        <p>Representatives for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the City Council want to try to resolve remaining differences on the budget package by today, city officials said, with a vote by the Council to adopt the spending plan perhaps as soon as Tuesday. The new fiscal year starts July 1.</p>
        <p>The talks between the administration and the Council have focused on differences in the tax-cut plans, as well as some relatively small differences in spending plans for certain city agencies. As of late yesterday, the two parties were considering adding $150 million to $200 million in spending to the budget over the mayor's April proposal to supplement programs like recycling and day care.</p>
        <p>As of yesterday evening, the negotiators had agreed to include a reduction in the commercial rent tax in the budget package, which, according to the mayor's April budget plan, would save businesses $16 million in the next fiscal year. And both sides are supporting cutting a surcharge on the personal income tax to 7 percent from 14 percent. For a taxpayer who earns $60,000 to $99,999 a year, that cut would save an average of $123, assuming the tax rate structure is not changed.</p>
        <p>The budget negotiations this year have been relatively stress-free, because the city economy is booming,  meaning there is a surplus in the current fiscal year of as much as $3.1 billion, which can used to help balance the 2001 fiscal year budget.</p>
        <p>But the talks have been complicated because of legislation under consideration in Albany that could require changes in pension benefits for retired city workers that would cost as much as $1 billion in the coming fiscal year. City officials have asked the state to pick up all or part of the cost of this program, which would give retirees automatic cost-of-living increases in their pensions.</p>
        <p>The city is also asking the state for the authority to borrow an additional $4 billion over the next four years, although so far it looks as though the Legislature is moving toward approving only $2.5 billion for the next two years.</p>
        <p>Depending on what actions are taken by the State Legislature and governor, the city may not be able to afford the tax cuts that the mayor and City Council are advocating, officials said.</p>
