        <p>Through June 17</p>
        <p>Lucky DeBellevue continues to offer a kind of Pop Arte Povera: whimsically abject works like a little folding table covered with pieces of white tape, or plastic boxes stuffed with lengths of tubular pipe insulation. He also presents a complicated, possibly allegorical piece in which a glittering, crowned column of clear plastic strips is joined by white laces to a dark, lumpy mass built from pipe cleaners.</p>
        <p>Those things pale in comparison, however, to three beautiful works made primarily from pipe cleaners, which Mr. DeBellevue knits into chromatically staggering, three-dimensional forms.</p>

        <p>Feature</p>
        <p>530 West 25th Street</p>
        <p>Chelsea</p>
        <p>Through June 17</p>
        <p>Lucky DeBellevue continues to offer a kind of Pop Arte Povera: whimsically abject works like a little folding table covered with pieces of white tape, or plastic boxes stuffed with lengths of tubular pipe insulation. He also presents a complicated, possibly allegorical piece in which a glittering, crowned column of clear plastic strips is joined by white laces to a dark, lumpy mass built from pipe cleaners.</p>
        <p>Those things pale in comparison, however, to three beautiful works made primarily from pipe cleaners, which Mr. DeBellevue knits into chromatically staggering, three-dimensional forms.</p>
        <p>One suspended piece is like a cartoon tree trunk, its dark chocolate color deepened by accents of bright red, yellow and green, its back side punctuated by a perky feather tail. Elsewhere, a funky star shape, its limbs modulating from ultramarine blue to moss green to coral orange, spans a corner of the gallery.</p>
        <p>The showstopper, a ballooning, helmet-shaped volume six and a half feet across, hangs from yellow plastic chains at center stage. Raspberry pink on the outside, with rusty orange layers underneath and a marigold border around its flared lower rim, it is at once stately, ridiculous and erotically lush.</p>
        <p>Mr. De Bellevue may understandably want to avoid typecasting as ''the pipe cleaner guy,'' but these works have it all: formal rigor, inventive and intensive craft, goofy humor and poetic imagination. You wonder why, for now, at least, he bothers doing anything else.</p>
