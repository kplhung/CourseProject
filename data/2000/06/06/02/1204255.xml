        <p>Things could turn around for the recently sold Islanders more quickly than anyone imagined. Yesterday, the Islanders, who were sold in April to Charles Wang and Sanjay Kumar of Computer Associates for $190 million, won the No. 1 pick in the June 24-25 National Hockey League entry draft.</p>
        <p>The Islanders, who had been slotted to choose fifth, had just an 8 percent chance of getting the top pick, but jumped to No. 1 when the number combination assigned them was selected at yesterday's draft drawing in Hasbrouck Heights, N.J. They are the first team since the inception of the drawing in 1995 to move from fifth to first.</p>

        <p>Things could turn around for the recently sold Islanders more quickly than anyone imagined. Yesterday, the Islanders, who were sold in April to Charles Wang and Sanjay Kumar of Computer Associates for $190 million, won the No. 1 pick in the June 24-25 National Hockey League entry draft.</p>
        <p>The Islanders, who had been slotted to choose fifth, had just an 8 percent chance of getting the top pick, but jumped to No. 1 when the number combination assigned them was selected at yesterday's draft drawing in Hasbrouck Heights, N.J. They are the first team since the inception of the drawing in 1995 to move from fifth to first.</p>
        <p>This is big; this is fantastic news, said the team's general manager, Mike Milbury. ''This is the break we've been waiting for for a long time. It just opens up a whole bunch of options.''</p>
        <p>The Islanders can either trade the pick or choose between the University of Wisconsin forward Dany Heatley or the Slovak wing Marian Gaborik. Both are considered players who can make an immediate impact.</p>
        <p>Other top prospects include defenseman Rostislav Klesa, center Scott Hartnell, left wing Raffi Torries and goaltender Rick DiPietro.</p>
        <p>''I'd definitely be happy to be an Islander,'' said Heatley, who attended Game 2 of the Stanley Cup finals last night. Heatley was born in Germany and raised in Calgary. He is 6 feet 1 inch and 200 pounds. He is a left-handed shot who played right wing last season.</p>
