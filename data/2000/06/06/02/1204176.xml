        <p>The Boston Celtics are absent from the postseason for a fifth consecutive year, but the best parts of their old hardcourt -- the parquet that ranks with the yellow brick road in the annals of fabled flooring -- are preparing for a final game.</p>
        <p>In Boston, parquet equals history. Maybe even art. So the floor on which Larry Bird's sneakers squeaked and Red Auerbach's cigar ashes fell will receive its last hurrah at an on-line auction starting Monday on sothebys.amazon.com.</p>
        <p>''There aren't many opportunities like this,'' said Leila Dunbar, a senior vice president and director of collectibles at Sotheby's, the auction house. ''What other floor in basketball has this kind of history?''</p>
        <p>The auction was timed to coincide with the National Basketball Association playoffs and will end June 15.</p>
        <p>From 1946 to 1999, the Celtics played on no home floor but the parquet -- crafted out of scraps of northern Tennessee red oak for $11,000 -- at the Boston Arena, the Boston Garden and the FleetCenter. The finale for the geriatric floor came on Dec. 22, when the Celtics lost to Atlanta, 98-81.</p>
        <p>Now, 40 of the 264 panels that comprised the floor are for sale.</p>
        <p>Twenty of the 2-foot-by-2-foot panels are laid out together at a 10th floor gallery at Sotheby's East Side building to recreate center court -- leprechaun logo included. Another 20 autographed and framed panels are to be displayed on walls where Impressionist paintings hung two weeks ago.</p>
        <p>''It was unique because it looked like no other floor,'' said Bill Russell, the center of the Celtic dynasty from 1956 to 1969. ''But what was most significant about the floor was that teams found it distracting. And that was all right.''</p>
        <p>Teams searched for reasons for losing to Boston, like the Boston Garden's dark and cold locker rooms or the floor's dribble-killing dead spots. ''It was part of our legend for kicking everybody's butts,'' Russell said.</p>
        <p>The auctioneers are not identifying or charging more for the dead spots. But they have priced the floor panels in order of their significance, with most of the proceeds going to charity;</p>
        <p>*The minimum acceptable bid for center court is $75,000.</p>
        <p>*The spot where John Havlicek stole the ball in Game 7 of the 1965 Eastern Conference finals: $15,000.</p>
        <p>*The panel where Russell made a spectacular block in the 1957 finals against St. Louis: $10,000.</p>
        <p>*The spot from which Phoenix's Garfield Heard launched his amazing shot in the second overtime of Game 5 of the 1976 finals: $5,000.</p>
        <p>Jeff Mann, sales director of Boston Parquet at the FleetCenter, examined old video to identify the panels of Celtic lore: Bird's theft of Isiah Thomas's inbounds pass during the 1987 Eastern Conference finals; Kevin McHale's favored low-post area; and where Bob Cousy cried when he bid farewell in 1963.</p>
        <p>The 53-year-life of the Celtics' floor is an anomaly, like a 25-year-old cat. Most N.B.A. floors endure for 7 to 10 years.</p>
        <p>Last July, the Utah Jazz's Delta Center floor was removed and auctioned off by Collectors Universe One-of-a-Kind. Some of the panels were acquired by Upper Deck, of Carlsbad, Calif., which used them to produce a limited edition of collectibles to commemorate the last shot of Michael Jordan's career in the 1998 finals, which gave the Chicago Bulls their eighth N.B.A. championship. Yesterday, on eBay, the bid for one of the items was $5,500.</p>
        <p>Upper Deck recently bought a home jersey worn by Joe DiMaggio in 1951, his final season, which failed to sell in April for the minimum price set by the auction house Christie's. The pinstriped top will be sliced into swatches and inserted as surprises in 2000 Upper Deck baseball card packs next month.</p>
        <p>Upper Deck has similarly diced a Jordan jersey and a Babe Ruth bat.</p>
        <p>The Celtics' floor seems destined for a better, more intact fate, especially for someone who can put center court in his or her rec room. The 200-plus panels not consigned to sothebys.amazon.com for the auction will be sold at retail at more modest prices, Mann said.</p>
        <p>Russell, never one to linger over nostalgia, has a few framed panels hanging on a wall at his Washington State home. ''Sometimes I just look at them and laugh,'' he said.</p>
