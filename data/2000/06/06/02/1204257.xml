        <p>Libor Charfreitag, a 22-year-old Southern Methodist junior from Slovakia, won the men's hammer throw for the second time in three years. His throw of 253-4 not only gave him the victory, but also broke his own national record and won him a place on the Slovak national team for the Sydney Olympic Games in September.</p>
