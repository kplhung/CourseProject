        <p>China and North Korea confirmed today that North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, was here this week for three days of secret meetings. The trip was the reclusive Mr. Kim's first journey abroad since he succeeded his father as leader in 1994 and his first visit to China since 1983.</p>

        <p>China and North Korea confirmed today that North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, was here this week for three days of secret meetings. The trip was the reclusive Mr. Kim's first journey abroad since he succeeded his father as leader in 1994 and his first visit to China since 1983.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kim, 58, ''the great leader,'' as he is called at home, took advantage of the trip to visit China's leading computer manufacturer, the Legend Group, as well as the imperial gate at Tiananmen Square, the Chinese reported.</p>
        <p>Occurring two weeks before Mr. Kim's scheduled meeting with President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea, the trip appeared to be aimed at shoring up ties with China, the lone important ally of economically stricken North Korea.</p>
        <p>China is eager to avoid serious instability in the region or a collapse of the Pyongyang government that might draw South Korean involvement or, perhaps, even American troops, to its border. China has encouraged the North to engage in peace talks and to open its economy to foreign trade and investment.</p>
        <p>China fought alongside North Korea against the United States and South Korea in the Korean War and was long an ally in Communism. But relations became strained in 1992, when Beijing extended diplomatic recognition to economically thriving South Korea, and they have only slowly recovered.</p>
        <p>On Mr. Kim's visit, from Monday to Wednesday, he was the guest of honor at a banquet given by President Jiang Zemin and met separately with other leaders, including Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, Vice President Hu Jintao and Li Peng, the former Prime Minister who heads the legislature. Mr. Kim was accompanied by top military and political officials.</p>
        <p>The two sides reached an ''important consensus'' on bilateral and regional issues of common concern, a spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry, Zhang Qiyue, said this evening, declining to be specific. ''Bilateral relations were raised to a new level.''</p>
        <p>China also made new promises of food and other aid for North Korea, Ms. Zhang said at a briefing.</p>
        <p>A short announcement today from the official North Korean news agency -- as in the case of China's issued only after Mr. Kim had completed his overnight train journey and was safely back home -- described an ''unshakable will'' to develop friendship with China and said, ''Consensus was reached on all matters discussed.''</p>
        <p>North Korea has tried to break out of its isolation, opening relations with Italy and Australia and holding talks with Japan and the United States.</p>
        <p>In footage of their meeting shown on Chinese television tonight, Mr. Kim wore a gray Mao-style jacket, and Mr. Jiang wore a Western-style suit and tie.</p>
        <p>Ms. Zhang declined to explain the extreme secrecy surrounding the trip, saying, ''We think this is a normal visit.''</p>
        <p>But other Chinese officials said privately the North Koreans had insisted that the visit be kept secret until Mr. Kim's return to Pyongyang, and they suggested that he was concerned about his security or the possibility of a coup attempt.</p>
        <p>In public, the Chinese were all smiles, stressing that the longstanding friendship between the two countries had been strengthened. Mr. Jiang told his guest that China welcomed the talks between North and South Korean leaders scheduled from June 12 to June 14 in Pyongyang, and ''hopes the two sides improve their relationship,'' the New China News Agency reported.</p>
        <p>Chinese officials have said in private they find the North Koreans unpredictable and frustrating, as well as too proud to accept openly Chinese coaching on economics or foreign policy. The official accounts today from China seemed intended to help the North Koreans save face, avoiding mention of issues that have strained relations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jiang was quoted as praising North Korea's economic achievements, even though it has suffered a severe decline and food shortages that have sent hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing to China.</p>
        <p>China was angered last year when North Korea tested a long-range missile, frightening Japan and spurring stronger efforts by Japan and the United States to develop antimissile defenses, which China strongly opposes.</p>
        <p>Ms. Zhang would not say whether the issue had been discussed, but restated China's hope to avoid any arms race in the region or any proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.</p>
        <p>China has for years encouraged North Korea to begin opening its tightly controlled economy, which collapsed after subsidies from the former Soviet Union ended nearly a decade ago. Officials refused to say whether Mr. Kim had made any commitments on that. But according to official Chinese accounts, Mr. Kim praised the success of China's economic reforms.</p>
