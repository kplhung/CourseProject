        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Central Park Keepers Struggling to Balance Masses With Grasses'' (front page, May 29): By all accounts, the Central Park Conservancy has done a terrific job beautifying Central Park. But it would be naive to think that its private money does not have a cost for the rest of us.</p>
        <p>Presumably, the wealthy people who give money to the conservancy are mostly white, wealthier and older than the general population. This would also make them less likely to find entertainment in skating, African drummers or children's soccer. The question then becomes, Is the private money worth it?</p>

        <p>I, for one, mourn the loss of the ''Guitar Man'' and would rather enjoy his sweet tones than have green grass. As private groups become involved in more of our public functions, the rich and powerful will also have more say over our private lives.</p>
