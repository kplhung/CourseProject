        <p>President Clinton arrived in Germany for a three-day visit today and faced immediate criticism of his administration's plans to build a limited missile defense system.</p>
        <p>In a 90-minute meeting with Mr. Clinton in the official Chancellery, Chancellor Gerhard Schroder added his voice to the chorus of European allies criticizing the administration's plan, telling Mr. Clinton that it could touch off a new arms race.</p>
        <p>Standing beside Mr. Clinton following their meeting, Mr. Schroder told reporters that the American president presented his views on his administration's position ''in a very frank way.'' Mr. Schroder added, ''I then went on and stated my concerns, concerns that we have to be very careful that any project does not re-trigger the process of a renewed arms race.''</p>
        <p>In an interview that will appear in Friday's Berliner Zeitung, Mr. Schroder was even more forceful, saying, ''Neither economically nor politically can we afford a new round of the arms race. No one can dispute the Americans' right to develop what they believe is right for national defense. On the other hand, we are partners in a common alliance.''</p>
        <p>Other German officials have warned that the missile defense would weaken military ties between the United States and its European allies. And they have accused the United States of overstating the threat.</p>
        <p>In his own remarks to reporters, Mr. Clinton did not respond to Mr. Schroder's assertions. But in briefing reporters later, the national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, acknowledged the criticism.</p>
        <p>''He expressed his concern that we proceed with due consideration for the impact on others, including Europe,'' Mr. Berger said in summing up Mr. Schroder's remarks.</p>
        <p>A number of European leaders are concerned that a missile defense system could upset existing disarmament accords, particularly the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty with Russia, which must be amended to allow for the missile defense plan.</p>
        <p>Neither Mr. Clinton nor any of his aides have made the point -- at least not publicly -- that the administration's plan is far less ambitious than one proposed by George W. Bush, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, who is ready to abandon the ABM treaty as a relic of the past.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Berger stressed that the discord was ''not at all sharp,'' adding, ''It was a very intelligent discussion of a very complicated issue.''</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Clinton laid out the American conviction that it must find ways to counter dangerous emerging nuclear threats like North Korea.</p>
        <p>''I'm concerned about how we proceed with Europe and their sense of comfort level with this,'' Mr. Berger paraphrased Mr. Clinton as telling Mr. Schroder. ''But ultimately, I've got to make a decision in terms of national security.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schroder's criticism slightly tarnished the opening of Mr. Clinton's visit to Berlin, the first by an American president since the city became the capital of a united Germany following the end of the cold war. On Friday Mr. Clinton travels to Aachen, the ancient capital of Charlemagne, to receive the Charlemagne Prize, awarded annually to a person who has worked toward European unity and prosperity.</p>
        <p>On another area of contention between the United States and Germany, Mr. Clinton expressed concern over Germany's handling of child custody cases involving American parents.</p>
        <p>According to the State Department, Germany favors German parents in custody cases and prevents American parents from gaining access to children living in Germany.</p>
        <p>Two prominent cases involve Lady Catherine Meyer, the wife of Sir Christopher Meyer, the British ambassador in Washington, and Joseph Cooke, a New Yorker. Lady Catherine's two sons from a previous marriage were abducted by their German father; she has been allowed to see them for a total of 24 hours in the past six years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cooke has been fighting to regain custody of his two children, who were handed over to foster parents in Germany seven years ago after his wife, a German, fled there with them and declared she was mentally ill.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schroder announced today that Germany would set up a working group of experts with the United States to investigate custody disputes involving American parents, but warned he could not interfere directly in the court system.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton has recently come under pressure from an organized lobby of American parents who complain that Germany has violated conventions guaranteeing the return of kidnapped children.</p>
        <p>Last week, the House of Representatives endorsed the effort in a resolution, voting 416 to 0.</p>
