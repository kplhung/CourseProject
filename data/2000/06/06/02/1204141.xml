        <p>Invoking World War II and the race to the moon, Vice President Al Gore promised today to double federal spending on cancer research and to make ''a flood'' of new cancer treatments and tests available to all Americans who need them.</p>
        <p>In a speech brimming with soaring oratory and buoyant optimism, Mr. Gore described the nation as standing on the brink of medical breakthroughs fueled by genetic research, and called on the federal government to use its resources to turn those discoveries into preventing and curing the most fatal cancers.</p>
        <p>''If I am entrusted with the presidency, I will work with you to put the same energy and priority into fighting cancer that we would put into preventing a war that could take 500,000 American lives every year,'' Mr. Gore, the likely Democratic nominee, told more than 600 people at Emory University Medical School. ''The stakes are that great. We can win this war.''</p>
        <p>The speech offered a vivid example of the recent tactical shift by Mr. Gore away from attacking his likely Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, and toward outlining his own vision in upbeat terms.</p>
        <p>All this week, Mr. Gore, who has been criticized by some Democrats as appearing overly harsh on the campaign trail, has brought a softer, more personal, even intimate touch to his events.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Mr. Gore and an Army friend described their experiences in Vietnam. On Tuesday, he and his wife, Tipper, who has been treated for depression, appeared together at a mental health forum. Today, Mr. Gore referred to the death of his sister, Nancy, from lung cancer and brought along her husband, Frank Hunger, to talk to reporters. And he has not criticized Mr. Bush all week.</p>
        <p>At Emory today, Mr. Gore outlined a multipoint plan for battling cancer, portions of which he had discussed before. He called for doubling, to $9 billion, the amount the federal government would spend over the next five years on cancer research. He advocated legislation to make clinical trials available to more adults and to require Medicare to pay for more cancer-screening tests. And he vowed to make changes to the Food and Drug Administration that would speed the approval of new cancer drugs.</p>
        <p>The address was short on policy details but long on sweeping phrases and historical analogies meant to inspire his audience. For example, Mr. Gore cited President John F. Kennedy's vow to put a man on the moon 40 years ago as a precedent for his own ambitious goal: to end all deaths from colon, breast and prostate cancer by the year 2010.</p>
        <p>''Some say it is impossible to find the answer to many forms of cancer,'' Mr. Gore said. ''I don't agree. One hundred years ago they said the same thing about smallpox. And 60 years ago they said the same thing about polio. They were wrong then. The pioneers and activists such as all of you convince me that the naysayers are wrong again now.''</p>
        <p>He also likened the mapping of the human genome, the template for genetic traits, to the Allies' breaking Nazi Germany's military code in World War II. The genome map, which is nearing completion, is widely expected to hasten the development of new drugs and screening tests for serious diseases.</p>
        <p>''We are on the verge of cracking another enemy secret code,'' Mr. Gore said. ''This enemy kills more Americans every single year than all the Americans who died throughout the entirety of World War II. When we intercept the messages that cancer sends secretly coded from cell to cell, we are going to turn the tide. We will gain the ability to decisively win the war against cancer.''</p>
        <p>The vice president restated his support for having the Food and Drug Administration regulate tobacco to prevent cigarette companies from selling ''deadly products'' to adolescents. Teenage smoking, he said, was ''the No. 1 preventable form of death and disease in America today.''</p>
        <p>In the 1996 Democratic National Convention, Mr. Gore gave a now-famous speech in which he described with searing detail the death of his sister from lung cancer in 1984. The address, meant to highlight the Clinton administration's war on smoking, brought tears to the eyes of some conventiongoers. But it also prompted critics to suggest that Mr. Gore had exploited a painful family chapter for political gain.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Gore obliquely referred to his sister's death without mentioning her. But he tried to show that her illness had changed him, giving him an emotional bond with cancer victims and infusing him with a passion to see the disease cured.</p>
        <p>''I know from my own family's experience what cancer can do to a family,'' he said. ''Many of us here have made sense of a loss by rededicating ourselves to the hope of a cure for others' loved ones.''</p>
        <p>The event today also started on a tearful note as the man who introduced Mr. Gore, Patrick Kardian, repeatedly choked up as he described his own battle with Hodgkin's disease. At one point, Mr. Gore wrapped an arm around Mr. Kardian and whispered in his ear, ''You're doing great.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Michael M. E. Johns, director of the university's health sciences center, said of Mr. Gore: ''He's showing a lot more passion than I've ever seen. I saw that human side of him today.''</p>
        <p>Among the proposals outlined by Mr. Gore were speeding up the process for having Medicare, the government health care program for the elderly and disabled, pay for new diagnostic tests for cancer.</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Gore's plan, a panel of medical experts would make recommendations on new tests worthy of Medicare coverage. If Congress did not act on a recommendation within 60 days, Medicare would automatically begin paying for it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore also proposed increasing by fivefold the number of patients participating in cancer clinical trials sponsored by the National Cancer Institute. He asserted that survival rates for children with cancer had risen sharply because most of those children participated in clinical tests. But less than 3 percent of adults with cancer participate in such tests, he said.</p>
        <p>He advocated legislation that would prohibit discrimination based on a person's genetic makeup, arguing that few people would undergo genetic tests that could pinpoint the potential for cancer if they feared losing their jobs or health insurance.</p>
        <p>And he urged the extension of Medicaid coverage to people who, through federal screening programs, were diagnosed with certain cancers, including breast and cervical, but who lacked health insurance.</p>
