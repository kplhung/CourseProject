        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>While I welcome your coverage of the landmark decision of the Israeli Supreme Court in our case (news article, May 23; Week in Review, May 28; news item, June 1), I wish to clarify certain matters that may mislead people and jeopardize their safety.</p>
        <p>Women of the Wall has won the right to pray at the Western Wall with a Torah, in a woman-only group, in the woman-only section, wearing prayer shawls, in a manner that does not violate Orthodox interpretation of Jewish law as accepted by many Orthodox rabbis and as pioneered by Orthodox feminists like Rivka Haut, a board member of Women of the Wall. Although our members represent all religious denominations, we use traditional Orthodox liturgy.</p>

        <p>We did not ask for the right to wear tefilin (phylacteries); such behavior  may not be protected by law. We invite Jewish women everywhere to join us in prayer on Sunday at the Western Wall.</p>
