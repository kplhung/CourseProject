        <p>THE STATES</p>
        <p>WON'T PLEDGE -- Might the days of The Pledge in tax-hating New Hampshire be over? For years, candidates seeking election there have pledged to block any new broad-based taxes. In her last two campaigns, Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, took the pledge and stood by it. Now, seeking a third term, she says she will not renew her vow. ''This year I cannot make that same promise, whatever the political price,'' the governor said this week. Declining to take the pledge has hurt more than one New Hampshire political hopeful over the years, but the state now faces a crisis: a court has ordered officials to find a fairer way to finance education, one less dependent on local property taxes. Four Republicans, a Democrat and an independent are expected to try to unseat Governor Shaheen, with at least three of them campaigning for an income tax to pay for schools. ''New times demand new thinking,'' the governor said. ''I will not arbitrarily rule out any potential solution to the challenge we face.''</p>

        <p>GENDER BREAKTHROUGH -- North Carolina, which has never elected a woman to any statewide office higher than secretary of state, is poised for something like a breakthrough this year. Two women are the major parties' nominees for lieutenant governor, and women, including a third-party candidate for governor, will also be on the November ballot in four other statewide races. The two nominees for lieutenant governor are state senators: Betsy L. Cochrane, a Republican, was the first woman to hold a leadership position in the General Assembly, and Beverly M. Perdue, a Democrat, has been co-chairwoman of the Senate Appropriations Committee since 1993.</p>

        <p>THE REFORM PARTY</p>
        <p>NO REFORM LINE IN TEXAS -- The Reform Party traces its founding to the political dreams of the Texas billionaire Ross Perot. But the party will not be on the Texas ballot in November. A member of its national committee from Texas, Kelly Abt, said this week that under pressure from Democratic and Republican leaders, the state had set ballot qualification hurdles so high that Patrick J. Buchanan, the party's likely presidential nominee, had been forced to run there as an independent. But the Reform state chairman, Larry Steele, blamed Mr. Buchanan, saying he could have helped get a Reform line on the ballot had he put up the money and effort to gather the necessary ballot-petition signatures. Mr. Buchanan, who has squabbled with state Reform leaders around the country (they consider him a hard-right zealot, not a reformer), says he decided to run as an independent because he was not confident of the signature-gathering ability of the Texas Reform Party.</p>

        <p>THE CONSTITUENTS</p>
        <p>TEAMSTERS STILL WAVER -- James P. Hoffa, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said yesterday that the 1.5-million-member union, the largest in the A.F.L.-C.I.O., might not endorse a presidential candidate this year. ''We're just not in a position to make that announcement now,'' Mr. Hoffa told reporters in Washington after a speech at the National Press Club. Last fall the Teamsters, along with the United Auto Workers, abstained when the labor federation announced its early endorsement of Vice President Al Gore. Since then the vice president has badly disappointed the Teamsters by supporting the trade deal with China. Mr. Hoffa said the next step in deciding whether to endorse a presidential candidate would be meetings with Gov. George W. Bush and with Ralph Nader of the Green Party.</p>

        <p>THE POLLS</p>
        <p>TOO CLOSE TO CALL -- Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush are locked in a dead heat five months before the presidential election, according to a Reuters/Zogby poll released yesterday. The poll found Mr. Bush barely ahead of Mr. Gore, 42 percent to 41 percent, with 17 percent undecided. Adding Mr. Buchanan, Ralph Nader of the Green Party and Harry Browne of the Libertarian Party to the race resulted in Mr. Bush's stretching his lead to only 42 percent to 39 percent. The poll surveyed 1,002 likely voters from Monday through Wednesday and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points, making Mr. Bush's lead statistically insignificant. In most recent polls, Mr. Bush has led Mr. Gore by five points or more. The director of the latest poll, John Zogby, said Mr. Gore had improved his standing with independents, women, blacks and Hispanics. When poll respondents were asked which party they would support in their own Congressional districts, 44 percent said Democratic while 36 percent said Republican -- a gap probably wide enough, should it hold, to allow Democrats to regain control of the House of Representatives.</p>
