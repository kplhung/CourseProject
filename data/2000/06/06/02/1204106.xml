        <p>THE star of the show at the fifth annual Greenwich Concours d'Elegance this weekend isn't an aristocratic Bentley or a pristine Bugatti. It's a much-traveled 1927 Fiat 509 that once hauled fish to market.</p>
        <p>The Greenwich concours has a tradition of being more than just a beauty show for cars. Each year, its founders, Bruce and Genia Wennerstrom, look for cars that have unusual stories behind them. They have also continued to expand the scope of the event, this year adding classic motorboats, motorcycles and even a vintage airplane.</p>
        <p>The old Fiat had been owned by Ignazio Franciamore in his home province, Agrigento, in Sicily; he used it as a taxi during World War II, then sold it in the 1950's to a man who used it for fish deliveries. In 1987, an American collector bought the car and brought it to Scranton, Pa. But it was shipped without antifreeze in the motor and the engine block cracked in the Northeast winter, rendering the car unusable.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franciamore's son, who shares his father's first name and nickname, Iggy, operates a BMW dealership, F &amp; S Motors, in the Bronx. He heard about the old Fiat parked, fittingly, behind a pizza restaurant in Scranton and went to look at it. When he examined the car's papers, he found his father's name on the list of previous owners.</p>
        <p>He bought the car, restored it, and in 1998 drove it in the Columbus Day parade in Manhattan. Both Iggy Franciamores, the 87-year-old father and his 60-year-old son, are expected to be on hand with the car in Greenwich. The elder Mr. Franciamore is expected to be at the wheel of the Fiat, for the first time since 1944, as the car passes the reviewing stand.</p>
        <p>More than 280 automobiles are expected at the two-day event, with different cars displayed each day. The theme for the Greenwich Concours d'Elegance tomorrow is cars from the late 1870's to the late 1970's, with both domestic and European cars in the pre-World War II field and American cars only in the postwar section. On Sunday, the Greenwich Concours Europa comprises postwar European sports, touring and competition cars.</p>
        <p>Among the featured cars will be a Ford GT40 Mk IV that was part of the Ford team that defeated Ferrari at Le Mans in 1967, and a 1933 Rolls-Royce Shooting Brake, or station wagon, that was used by the British Army in its Libya campaign of World War II. Other notable entries include a 1940 Cadillac four-door convertible sedan with side-mounted spare tires; a 1950 Buick Super wood-paneled wagon: a 1953 Ferrari 342 America cabriolet, one of only three built; and a 1929 Stutz Black Hawk Vertical 8 boat-tailed speedster.</p>
        <p>Once again, the concours will have a circle of supercars, featuring ultra-high-performance cars of recent vintage like a McLaren F1 and a Ferrari F40 -- street-legal models capable of speeds over 180 miles an hour.</p>
        <p>The event takes place from 10 to 5 both days, with awards presentations starting each day at 3 p.m. Admission is $12, with children 12 and under free if accompanied by an adult; proceeds benefit Americares. The concours takes place at Roger Sherman Baldwin Park, 100 Arch St., in Greenwich, Conn. Further information can be obtained by calling (203) 618-0460.</p>
