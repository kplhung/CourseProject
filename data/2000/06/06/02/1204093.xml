        <p>Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.</p>
        <p>BONNIE PRINCE BILLY, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. Will Oldham, whose performing moniker has changed from Palace to Bonnie Prince Billy with several steps between, writes and sings as if he had swallowed the Smithsonian Folkways calalog  whole. His mournfulness is timeless and startlingly unironic without ever being earnest. His current ensemble gets him rocking, making his affinity to Neil Young and Bruce Springsteen as clear as his old penchant for anonymous murder ballads. With Mikey Wild, the Centuries and the Israelites. Tomorrow at 8 p.m.; admission is $12 (Ann Powers).</p>

With Mikey Wild, the Centuries and the Israelites. Tomorrow at 8 p.m.; admission is $12 (Ann Powers).</p>
        <p>* CARLA BOZULICH, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. The ferocious and lyrical singer and songwriter behind the venerable Los Angeles bands Geraldine Fibbers and Ethyl Meatplow reveals her latest incarnation tonight. Expect some serious spine tingles. Tonight at midnight; admission is $10 (Powers).</p>
        <p>* URI CAINE, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. This pianist from Philadelphia, known to many from his longstanding place in Don Byron's bands, has been cranking out high-concept ideas on the German record label Winter &amp; Winter. He has been developing a series of personal takes on classical composers: first Mahler, now Bach's ''Goldberg'' Variations. In each he uses instrumentation that adds up to something other than your father's classical music: clarinet, trumpet, a DJ, a jazz rhythm section. It will be good to see this worked out in a jazz club rather than on a concert stage. Mr. Caine's Mahler project is performed tonight at 8 and 10; cover charge is $25, plus a $10 food and drink minimum. The debut performances of his ''Goldberg'' Variations project are tomorrow night at 8, 10:30 and midnight, with a $25 cover plus $10 minimum, and Sunday at 7 and 9 p.m., with an $18 cover and $10 minimum (Ben Ratliff).</p>
        <p>NELS CLINE'S INKLING QUARTET, JOE GALLIVAN'S RAINFOREST INITIATIVE, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. Mr. Cline, a Los Angeles-based guitarist, has one of the most unusual resumes in popular music: he has worked with the postpunk hero Mike Watt and the Geraldine Fibbers rock band as well as the jazz hero Julius Hemphill. This band includes Zeena Parkins on harp, and the West Coast transplant rhythm section of Ken Filiano on bass and Billy Mintz on drums. Joe Gallivan's Rainforest Initiative, featuring the English saxophonists Evan Parker and Elton Dean, promises a mixture of Hawaiian chanting and free improvising -- not your run-of-the-mill gig. The above are two separate sets tomorrow at 8 and 10 p.m.; tickets are $30, which includes admission to all shows for the evening (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* DEL THE FUNKEE HOMOSAPIEN, BLACKALICIOUS, BLOOD OF ABRAHAM, M.C. PAUL BARMAN, S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, near Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940. This fine bill testifies to the continuing health of underground hip-hop. Del has been doing his avant-garde thing since 1991, and Blood of Abraham proved that Jews could rap a few years later. The Blackalicious crew is a relative newcomer, representing the thriving Quannum scene from Oakland, Calif. And the M.C. Paul Barman is the Catskills-style cut-up who has all the hipsters chuckling this year. Sunday at 8 p.m.; admission is $15. (Powers).</p>
        <p>CYRILLE-DRESSER-EHRLICH TRIO, Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival, Knitting Factory, Old Office, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. This band, consisting of the drummer Andrew Cyrille, the bassist Mark Dresser and the saxophonist Marty Ehrlich, seems to get together for festival season regularly now. These three are exemplary musicians patrolling the boundary between tradition and experimentation, and they can play fiercely, fusing cast-iron technique with loose interaction. Sets are Sunday at 7 and 8 p.m.; tickets are $25 in advance or $30 on show day for the whole night of concerts at the club, which includes Matt Moran's Sideshow, David Murray's Speaking in Tongues and Jeff Robinson's Live Bird (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>GROOVIE GHOULIES, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, at 11th Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-0406. It's Halloween in June with this Sacramento band, a perennial favorite on the garage-punk circuit. Thrill and chill to the Ghoulies' spooky yet cheerful repertory, including ''Graveyard Girlfriend,'' ''Do the Bat'' and ''Bye Bye Brain.'' Tonight at 9:30; admission is $7 (Powers).</p>
        <p>* CHARLIE HADEN'S QUARTET WEST WITH STRING ORCHESTRA, Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival, Angel Orensanz Foundation, 172 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212) 343-8805. Over the last decade, the bassist Charlie Haden has revealed his enormous soft spot for jazz as an element of Hollywood film-noir soundtracks and as a kind of gilded nostalgia; his series of records on Verve have done the idea justice. This concert, a first in New York, pairs his Quartet West with a string orchestra for a program of American popular songs. Tonight at 8; tickets are $25 (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>IAN HUNTER, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. The man who jumped the gap between pub rock and glam works his classic-rock charm in this retrospective show. The late Mick Ronson will be missed on guitar, but Mr. Hunter has enough bravado to compensate. Come with lighters to hold aloft during ''All the Young Dudes.'' Tonight at 8; admission is $20 (Powers).</p>
        <p>D. D. JACKSON QUINTET, ''TO LOUIS ARMSTRONG,'' Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. Mr. Jackson, a pianist, likes doing things differently, and his second album since jumping from the minors to RCA puts him in, of all things, an electric fusion context. ''To Louis Armstrong,'' a mini-jazz opera written and directed by Roz Nixon, has a pretty amazing band to back up whatever its narrative may be: the trumpeter Roy Hargrove, the pianist John Hicks, the bassist Christian McBride, the trombonist Wycliffe Gordon and the drummer Bernard (Pretty) Purdie. Mr. Jackson goes on tonight at 8 and ''To Louis Armstrong'' at 10; tickets are $35 for the night (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>PAUL KANTNER, MARTY BALIN, Bottom Line, 15 West Fourth Street, at Mercer Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-7880. These two Hall of Famers from the Jefferson Airplane will perform the band's 1969 album, ''Volunteers,'' in its entirety, with help from their friends Slick Aguilar, Diana Mangano and Chris Smith. There is no word on whether their old friend Grace will pop in to Slick things up a bit. Expect much cosmic meandering anyway. Tomorrow and Sunday at 7:30 and 10:30 p.m.; admission is $25 (Powers).</p>
        <p>THE KLEZMATICS, Makor, 35 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 601-1000. The premier rocking free-jazz klezmer fusion group struts its stuff tomorrow with special guests to be announced. Part of the Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival. Tomorrow at 9:30 p.m.; admission is $20 (Powers).</p>
        <p>PAT MARTINO'S HIP-BOP TRIO, Iridium, 44 West 63rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 582-2121. Mr. Martino is one of jazz's finest guitarists, with a limpid sound and fast fingers. But he still likes to play in the earthy context with which he began in Philadelphia in the 1960's. His new trio includes the organist Larry Goldings and the drummer Idris Muhammad, one of the funkiest players alive. Sets are tonight through Sunday night at 8:30 and 10:30, with additional midnight shows tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $30, plus a $10 minimum. (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* FUNKY METERS, ME'SHELL NDEGEOCELLO, THE JAZZ MANDOLIN PROJECT, Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival, the Lawn, Battery Park, Lower Manhattan, (212) 343-8805. It's the first of the Bell Atlantic's big concert-style-sprawls, which define the festival this year. Dynastically carrying on the tradition of the great New Orleans group the Meters, the Funky Meters combine funk and Crescent City rhythms into party music. Ms. Ndegeocello explores the depths of her psyche and writes the results out in slow-rolling soul. The Jazz Mandolin Project merge bluegrass with jazz and the jam-band style. Tonight at 7; tickets are $35 (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* ERIC REED'S NEW YORK SEVEN, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037. Mr. Reed recently switched his mode of thinking, from a longstanding piano trio to this larger group. With a band including a few Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra members and the exciting rhythm section of the newcomers Barak Moriand Rodney Green, it's full of concise arrangements and fleet, fifth-gear swing. Sets are tonight through Sunday night at 9:30 and 11:30, with a 1 a.m. set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $20, plus $10 minimum tonight and tomorrow; $15 plus $10 minimum on Sunday (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* MAX ROACH AND CECIL TAYLOR DUO, DAVID S. WARE QUARTET, JOEY BARON AND RON CARTER DUO, BOB STEWART AND THE LAGUARDIA HIGH SCHOOL JAZZ BAND, Columbia University, Low Plaza, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 343-8805. Back in 1979, Mr. Roach, the drummer, and Mr. Taylor, the pianist, initiated what would become a series of duet meetings at Columbia University's Wollman Auditorium; they challenge the idea of free interplay by the fact that they're both steeped in their own very definite styles. They're both over 70 now, and it will be curious to see if age has made them more truculent, or less. The long, free concert starts at 6 p.m. on Sunday (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* YO LA TENGO, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Union Square, (212) 777- 1600.The long-surviving Hoboken-based trio Yo La Tengo is a band that feels at home with mystery. In songs that are equal parts intimate revelation and musical questing that goes way beyond words, Ira Kaplan, Georgia Hubley, and James McNew invite fans to find the connection between the ordinary and the sublime. Tonight they share the bill with the free-jazz drummer Susie Ibarra, who just may join them for one of their famous jams. Tonight at 8; admission is $16.50. The performance is sold out, but returns may be available (Powers).</p>
        <p>Z-100 ZOOTOPIA TOUR, Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (516) 794-9303. Stop complaining about the fatuousness of today's pop and get your feet wet in it at this season-inaugurating Top 40 extravaganza. The night's ice cream flavors include Destiny's Child, Savage Garden, Sugar Ray, Macy Gray, Christina Aguilera, the Goo Goo Dolls, Hanson and Vitamin C. Tonight at 7; tickets are $30, $40 and $50; the performance is sold out, but returns may be available  (Powers).</p>
