        <p>IN a move that consumer advocates say could benefit owners of all brands of vehicles, the Ford Motor Company has agreed to cover head-gasket repairs for some rear-wheel-drive cars with the 3.8-liter V-6 engine.</p>
        <p>Ford had announced in February that it would pay for repairs on about 718,000 front-drive automobiles with that engine: the 1994-95 Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable, the 1994 Lincoln Continental and the 1995 Ford Windstar. But the rear-drive cars -- Ford Mustangs, Mercury Cougars and Ford Thunderbirds from the 1994-95 model years -- were excluded. Some consumers were stuck with bills ranging from $1,600 for gasket repairs to $4,000 for destroyed engines.</p>

        <p>IN a move that consumer advocates say could benefit owners of all brands of vehicles, the Ford Motor Company has agreed to cover head-gasket repairs for some rear-wheel-drive cars with the 3.8-liter V-6 engine.</p>
        <p>Ford had announced in February that it would pay for repairs on about 718,000 front-drive automobiles with that engine: the 1994-95 Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable, the 1994 Lincoln Continental and the 1995 Ford Windstar. But the rear-drive cars -- Ford Mustangs, Mercury Cougars and Ford Thunderbirds from the 1994-95 model years -- were excluded. Some consumers were stuck with bills ranging from $1,600 for gasket repairs to $4,000 for destroyed engines.</p>
        <p>Ford changed its mind this spring, saying it now realizes that owners of those cars were also having problems. It is extending the head-gasket warranty on about 294,000 of the rear-drive cars and reimbursing owners who already paid for repairs.</p>
        <p>A head gasket is a thin seal between the engine block and the cylinder head; if it fails, coolant can leak out or seep into mechanical components, potentially causing total engine failure.</p>
        <p>Phil Edmonston, author of the annual ''Lemon-Aid Car Guide,'' said Ford's action was important to owners of other makes because it reinforced the idea that engines should not suffer major defects for at least 7 years or 100,000 miles. General Motors and Toyota have offered similar special policies to cover head-gasket defects.</p>
        <p>Mr. Edmonston, who also has a Web site, www.lemonaidcars.com, said that having such a ''durability parameter'' would give consumers who have problems with other cars ammunition to use in small-claims court or in negotiations with car companies. In addition, Ford's action puts pressure on other automakers to follow suit.</p>
        <p>One company that could feel such pressure is DaimlerChrysler. Some of its 2-liter 4-cylinder engines have also had head-gasket problems, which the company is covering case by case.</p>
        <p>Under its new policy, Ford will extend to seven years or 100,000 miles, whichever comes first, the warranty on the head gaskets on the 3.8-liter V-6 in '94-'95 models. The normal warranty is 3 years or 36,000 miles.</p>
        <p>The automaker will also reimburse consumers who had those repairs done, even if the work was not done by a Ford dealer, a company spokesman, Mike Vaughn, said. There is no limit on the repair cost, and Ford will pay if a new engine was required. The policy also covers owners of used cars.</p>
        <p>The letter being sent to consumers will tell those who already paid for repairs how they can apply for a refund. Those who purchased the vehicles used and do not receive a letter should contact a Ford dealer.</p>
        <p>''Ford is taking a Band-Aid approach to it,'' said Clarence M. Ditlow of the Center for Auto Safety. ''They put on one Band-Aid to see if it would stop the bleeding. It didn't. Now they put on another one, a bigger Band-Aid. But what they need to do is have a comprehensive program.''</p>
        <p>He said Ford should have extended the warranty to 120,000 miles, ''which is the average useful life of a vehicle today,'' and should have covered models predating 1994.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ditlow and Mr. Edmonston want Ford to include '93 cars; Mr. Ditlow said he thought the problem dated as far back as '88 models. Mr. Vaughn said records showed there was no problem with earlier vehicles.</p>
        <p>Although he urged Ford to cover '93 models, Mr. Edmonston said the company was responding in a generous, timely manner. He said DaimlerChrysler should do the same on 2-liter engines in the 1995-99 Neon, Dodge Stratus, Plymouth Breeze, Dodge Avenger and Chrysler Sebring. The problems are being dealt with case by case; the company has not extended the warranty.</p>
        <p>A DaimlerChrysler spokesman, Mike Aberlich, said all owners were not being notified because ''it does not appear to be a universal problem.'' He added: ''That's not to say that we might not decide to do something in the future. We are still watching and analyzing it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Aberlich said DaimlerChrysler was reimbursing consumers for out-of-warranty repairs case by case when they called the company's toll-free assistance number -- (800) 992-1997 -- or went to dealerships. He said the dealers would consider factors including whether there was any evidence that the vehicle was abused.</p>
        <p>One problem with DaimlerChrysler's policy is that owners who figure their warranty no longer applies and go to independent repair shops instead of to dealers might lose a chance for eventual reimbursement. ''They are penalized,'' Mr. Edmonston said.</p>
