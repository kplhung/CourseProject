        <p>The man who drafted Michael Jordan will soon be hired to lead the Nets. Rod Thorn, the league's executive vice president of basketball operations, has agreed in principle to become the Nets' new president and director of basketball, according to a member of the YankeeNets organization.</p>
        <p>Thorn, who has worked for 14 years in the league office, did not return phone calls yesterday seeking comment on his position with the Nets. Thorn was the general manager for the Chicago Bulls from 1978 to 1984, the year he selected Jordan with the third pick of the draft. Houston had selected Hakeem Olajuwon and Portland had chosen Sam Bowie before Thorn chose Jordan.</p>

        <p>The man who drafted Michael Jordan will soon be hired to lead the Nets. Rod Thorn, the league's executive vice president of basketball operations, has agreed in principle to become the Nets' new president and director of basketball, according to a member of the YankeeNets organization.</p>
        <p>Thorn, who has worked for 14 years in the league office, did not return phone calls yesterday seeking comment on his position with the Nets. Thorn was the general manager for the Chicago Bulls from 1978 to 1984, the year he selected Jordan with the third pick of the draft. Houston had selected Hakeem Olajuwon and Portland had chosen Sam Bowie before Thorn chose Jordan.</p>
        <p>''Rod Thorn is a very sound basketball guy and he stands for all the right things in the game,'' said one league official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ''He'll do well and he will command a lot of respect for the Nets.''</p>
        <p>Thorn, who over the past few years has become best known as the league's disciplinarian, will bring instant credibility to a franchise that has long been in search of stability and leadership. He has been involved in the National Basketball Association for three decades as a player, assistant coach, head coach, general manager and league official.</p>
        <p>Thorn, 59, has served for several years as the chairman of the senior men's basketball committee for U.S.A. Basketball, the organization responsible for selecting players for the Olympics and the world championships.</p>
        <p>It will be a homecoming of sorts for Thorn, who is joining the Nets' franchise for the third time. He was a New York Nets assistant coach under Kevin Loughery in 1973-1974, the season the Nets won the first of two American Basketball Association championships, and 1974-1975.</p>
        <p>After becoming the head coach of the A.B.A.'s Spirits of St. Louis for one season, Thorn rejoined the Nets as an assistant coach for their first two seasons in the N.B.A.</p>
        <p>As the Nets' president and director of basketball, Thorn will have the responsibility of reshaping the franchise. His first priorities will be to lead the Nets through the draft, to decide the future of General Manager John Nash with the team and to name a head coach.</p>
        <p>Nash and his staff of scouts and assistant coaches, all of whom were retained after Coach Don Casey was fired on April 26, have been working diligently at scouting players for the June 28 draft. It is likely that Nash and the scouts will remain for the draft, and there is a chance that they will be kept aboard for next season.</p>
        <p>''Rod Thorn has a lot of respect for John Nash,'' a person in the league office said. ''He thinks he is a solid general manager and does not attribute any of the team's past problems to him.''</p>
        <p>The head coaching situation seems to be wide open at this point. But some possibilities include Isiah Thomas, Byron Scott and Eddie Jordan, a current Nets assistant.</p>
        <p>The Nets' principal owner, Lewis Katz, has said the club will let the new president and director lead the coaching search.</p>
        <p>As recently as Wednesday, the Nets were considering other candidates for the president's job, including Mitch Kupchak, Danny Ainge and David Kahn.</p>
        <p>The Nets approached Thorn about directing the team last November, but then the league promoted him from senior vice president of basketball to his current position.</p>
        <p>A close friend of Thorn's who also works in the league office said Thorn had second thoughts almost immediately, and a person with knowledge of the Nets' front-office search said Thorn began campaigning for the Nets' job more than a month ago.</p>
        <p>After an all-American career at the University of West Virginia, Thorn was selected by the Baltimore Bullets with the second pick in the 1963 N.B.A. draft. The 6-foot-4-inch guard went on to play for Detroit, St. Louis and Seattle, averaging 10.8 points over an eight-year career.</p>
        <p>Upon retiring, Thorn worked as an assistant for Lenny Wilkens in Seattle, before joining the Nets' coaching staff. After concluding his second stint with the Nets in 1978, Thorn took over as Bulls general manager and coached them for 30 games during the 1982 season. He was released by the Bulls just months after drafting Jordan.</p>
