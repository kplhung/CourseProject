        <p>In his second solo effort in New York, the young German artist Tobias Rehberger continues to fritter away his talent on a combination of the obvious and the arcane. The gallery is lined with a continuous screen of structures that suggest relatively thick room dividers.

        <p>Lights from undetermined sources flicker on the walls behind these units, which suggest walk-in versions of European abstraction (Vasarely and Herbin) or a swath of 1960's-style bachelor-pad design. That is, the forms might hold a few books, but more likely they are disguised wet bars or stereos.</p>

        <p>In his second solo effort in New York, the young German artist Tobias Rehberger continues to fritter away his talent on a combination of the obvious and the arcane. The gallery is lined with a continuous screen of structures that suggest relatively thick room dividers. Each features a composition of bright geometric shapes, also thick, and has a strange title -- like ''Jack Lemmon's Legs Library,'' ''Tom Cruise Jumping Library,'' ''Counting Money Library'' and ''Climbing Ladders Library.''</p>
        <p>Lights from undetermined sources flicker on the walls behind these units, which suggest walk-in versions of European abstraction (Vasarely and Herbin) or a swath of 1960's-style bachelor-pad design. That is, the forms might hold a few books, but more likely they are disguised wet bars or stereos.</p>
        <p>A look behind these units, while explicitly discouraged by a sign, reveals that each holds one to three small television sets that manically repeat different shots of a single subject (Mr. Lemmon's legs, for instance) that have been lifted from dozens of Hollywood films.</p>
        <p>These works continue Mr. Rehberger's interest in the overlap among design, abstract art and popular culture, just as the inaccessible punch line is consistent with the often hermetic quality of his efforts. Still, if and when one steps behind the colorful facade, the back of the show quickly reduces one's interest in the front. In other words, Mr. Rehberger's conceptual ironies, not to mention his film editing, outstrip his pursuit of a genuinely powerful visual experience.</p>
