        <p>'Walker Evans and African Art, 1935'</p>
        <p>Metropolitan Museum of Art</p>
        <p>Fifth Avenue at 81st Street</p>
        <p>Through Sept. 3</p>
        <p>Although the Metropolitan Museum of Art's recent full-scale retrospective of Walker Evans's photography has gone, a simultaneous show of African sculpture images that he took in 1935 for the Museum of Modern Art lingers on for a while in the galleries devoted to the Arts of Africa, Oceania and the Americas. The photographs are accompanied by some of the actual sculptures.</p>
        <p>At first glance, the African photographs are a far cry from the intensely American depictions of places and people that made Evans's reputation. But actually they are all of a piece -- at least aesthetically -- with his other work. Symmetrically positioned, with soft lighting that created no shadows, and tightly cropped, they were in effect a preview of the compressed compositional style he was to use in photographing the houses, places and people that conveyed his vision of American life.</p>

        <p>Although the Metropolitan Museum of Art's recent full-scale retrospective of Walker Evans's photography has gone, a simultaneous show of African sculpture images that he took in 1935 for the Museum of Modern Art lingers on for a while in the galleries devoted to the Arts of Africa, Oceania and the Americas. The photographs are accompanied by some of the actual sculptures.</p>
        <p>At first glance, the African photographs are a far cry from the intensely American depictions of places and people that made Evans's reputation. But actually they are all of a piece -- at least aesthetically -- with his other work. Symmetrically positioned, with soft lighting that created no shadows, and tightly cropped, they were in effect a preview of the compressed compositional style he was to use in photographing the houses, places and people that conveyed his vision of American life.</p>
        <p>Evans (1903-1975) took these relatively unknown photographs to document the Modern's ''African Negro Art,'' one of the first exhibitions in the United States to present African sculptures as art rather than ethnographic objects. By that time he had already made a reputation as a photographer. The museum's hefty commission -- to shoot more than 450 of the sculptures for a teaching portfolio -- came just before he accepted an important assignment from the federal Farm Security Agency to make documentary photographs of the rural South and parts of the Northeast affected by the Great Depression.</p>
        <p>With the printmaking help of a fellow photographer, Evans was able to juggle the two jobs, as attested by this impressive showing of more than 50 vintage images -- masks, figures, jewelry and utilitarian objects -- from the Modern portfolio. Shot against varied backgrounds chosen by Evans -- blotting paper, pieces of felt, gray sateen -- they are notable for their clarity of detail and strategic positioning to bring out the important contours and features of each work. (Next week, the museum staff will rotate these images, installing another set of prints from the series.)</p>
        <p>Of course, the sculptures themselves are remarkably photogenic, including such arresting objects as a shiny ovoid mask (now owned by the Metropolitan) with pointed chin and sharply stylized features from the Dan people of Liberia and a slim, full-length figure of a fierce looking Fon war god from Benin, holding a weapon in each hand. But Evans saw them for the masterpieces they are, and conveyed their power with real devotion.</p>
