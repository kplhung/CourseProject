        <p>Following are excerpts from the decision yesterday by a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit upholding the denial of an asylum hearing to Elian Gonzalez:</p>
        <p>The courts retain the authority to check agency policy making for procedural compliance and for arbitrariness. But the courts cannot properly re-examine the wisdom of an agency-promulgated policy. . . . In this case, because the law -- particularly section 1158 -- is silent about the validity of plaintiff's purported asylum applications, it fell to the I.N.S. to make a discretionary policy choice. The I.N.S., exercising its gap-filling discretion, determined these things: (1) 6-year-old children lack the capacity to sign and to submit personally an application for asylum; (2) instead, 6-year-old children must be represented by an adult in immigration matters; (3) absent special circumstances, the only proper adult to represent a 6-year-old child is the child's parent, even when the parent is not in this country; and, (4) that the parent lives in a communist totalitarian state (such as Cuba), in and of itself, does not constitute a special circumstance requiring the selection of a nonparental representative. Our duty is to decide whether this policy might be a reasonable one in the light of the statutory scheme. . . .</p>
        <p>While the policy announced by the I.N.S. may not harmonize perfectly with earlier I.N.S. interpretative guidelines (which are not law), the parties have cited, and we have found, no statutory provision, no regulatory authority, and no prior agency adjudication that ''flatly contradicts'' the policy. . . .</p>
        <p>We accept that the I.N.S. policy at issue here comes within the range of reasonable choices.</p>
        <p>First, we cannot say that the foundation of the policy -- the I.N.S. determination that 6-year-old children necessarily lack sufficient capacity to assert, on their own, an asylum claim -- is unreasonable. . . . The next element of the I.N.S. policy -- that a 6-year-old child must be represented by some adult in applying for asylum -- necessarily is reasonable.  . . .</p>
        <p>Critically important, the I.N.S. policy does not neglect completely the independent and separate interest that a child may have, apart from his parents, in applying for asylum. . . . Instead, according to the I.N.S. policy, special circumstances may exist that render a parent an inappropriate representative for the child.  Where such circumstances do exist, the I.N.S. policy appears to permit other persons, besides a parent, to speak for the child in immigration matters. So, to some extent, the policy does protect a child's own right to apply for asylum under section 1158 despite the contrary wishes of his parents. . . .</p>
        <p>And we cannot invalidate the policy -- one with international-relations implications -- selected by the I.N.S. merely because we personally might have chosen another. . . . The final aspect of the I.N.S. policy also worries us some. According to the I.N.S. policy, that a parent lives in a communist-totalitarian state is no special circumstance, sufficient in and of itself, to justify the consideration of a 6-year-old child's asylum claim (presented by a relative in this country) against the wishes of the nonresident parent. We acknowledge, as a widely accepted truth, that Cuba does violate human rights and fundamental freedoms and does not guarantee the rule of law to people living in Cuba. . . .</p>
        <p>Persons living in such a totalitarian state may be unable to assert freely their own legal rights, much less the legal rights of others. Moreover, some reasonable people might say that a child in the United States inherently has a substantial conflict of interest with a parent residing in a totalitarian state when that parent -- even when he is not coerced -- demands that the child leave this country to return to a country with little respect for human rights and basic freedoms.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, we cannot properly conclude that the I.N.S. policy is totally unreasonable in this respect. The I.N.S. policy does take some account of the possibility of government coercion: where special circumstances -- such as definite coercion directed at an individual parent -- exist, a nonparental representative may be necessary to speak for the child. In addition and more important, in no context is the executive branch entitled to more deference than in the context of foreign affairs. . . . This aspect of the I.N.S. policy seems to implicate the conduct of foreign affairs more than any other. Something even close to a per se rule -- that, for immigration purposes, no parent living in a totalitarian state has sufficient liberty to represent and to serve the true, best interests of his own child in the United States -- likely would have significant consequences for the president's conduct of our nation's international affairs: such a rule would focus not on the qualities of the particular parent, but on the qualities of the government of the parent's country. As we understand the legal precedents, they, in effect, direct that a court of law defer especially to this international-relations aspect of the I.N.S. policy. . . .</p>
        <p>The essence of plaintiff's asylum claim was that, if he is returned to Cuba: (1) he will not enjoy the freedom that he has in the United States; (2) he might be forced to undergo  ''re-education'' and indoctrination in communist theory; and (3) he might be used by the Cuban government for propaganda purposes. No one should doubt that, if plaintiff returns to  Cuba, he will be without the degree of liberty that people enjoy in the United States. Also, we admit that re-education, communist indoctrination and political manipulation of Plaintiff for propaganda purposes, upon a return to Cuba, are not beyond the realm of possibility.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, we cannot say that the I.N.S.'s assessment of plaintiff's asylum claim -- that it probably lacked merit -- was arbitrary. To make a meritorious asylum claim, an asylum applicant must show that he has a ''well-founded fear of persecution'' in his native land. . . . Congress largely has left the task of defining with precision the phrase  ''well-founded fear of persecution'' to the I.N.S. . . . Plaintiff points to no earlier I.N.S. adjudications or judicial decisions where a person, in circumstances similar to plaintiff's, was found to have established a ''well-founded fear of persecution.'' Political conditions ''which affect the populace as a whole or in large part are generally insufficient to establish'' persecution. . . .</p>
        <p>We cannot say that the INS had to treat education and indoctrination as synonymous with ''persecution.'' . . .  We have not the slightest illusion about the I.N.S.'s choices: the choices -- about policy and about application of the policy -- that the I.N.S. made in this case are choices about which reasonable people can disagree. Still, the choices were not unreasonable, not capricious and not arbitrary, but were reasoned and reasonable. The I.N.S.'s considerable discretion was not abused.</p>
        <p>Conclusion</p>
        <p>As policy makers, it is the duty of the Congress and of the executive branch to exercise political will. Although courts should not be unquestioning, we should respect the other branches' policy making powers. The judicial power is a limited power. It is the duty of the judicial branch not to exercise political will, but only to render judicial judgment under the law.</p>
        <p>When the I.N.S. was confronted with plaintiff's purported asylum applications, the immigration law of the United States provided the I.N.S. with no clear answer. The I.N.S. accordingly developed a policy to deal with the extraordinary circumstances of asylum applications filed on behalf of a 6-year-old child, by the child himself and a nonparental relative, against the express wishes of the child's parents (or sole parent).</p>
