        <p>At dawn on a Friday morning, hours before the Sabbath, Rabbi Moshe Unsdorfer stepped into a cherry picker and sent himself 20 feet into the air above Borough Park.</p>
        <p>Leaning out of the bucket, he guided a fishing line past an electrical wire, then tied his line off on a pole, checking that it was taut and parallel to the ground.</p>
        <p>The fishing line forms the basic ingredient of an eruv, a symbolic enclosure within which Orthodox Jews are exempted from one of the stricter rules of the Sabbath: the ban on carrying anything in public. But in Borough Park, only some rabbis recognize the eruv, a series of strings that stretch around nearly the entire neighborhood. And the dispute over its legitimacy is the source of one of the biggest controversies in Borough Park since Orthodox Jews began moving to the neighborhood 90 years ago.</p>
        <p>Official witnesses who have used the eruv have been rejected by anti-eruv rabbis minutes before wedding ceremonies. Rabbis who oppose the eruv have had invitations to give guest lectures to pro-eruv congregations rescinded. Vandals have torn down parts of the eruv, prompting supporters to initiate an all-night rabbinical patrol before the Sabbath. During Hanukkah, men opposed to the eruv took to the streets in a truck with loudspeakers, proclaiming in Yiddish that the fishing line was broken and that Jews should not use the eruv. In response, the pro-eruv forces created a telephone hot line in Yiddish so families could check on the condition of the enclosure right before the Sabbath began.</p>
        <p>On the surface, the eruv debate is simply one of differing Talmudic interpretation. But over the last eight months, the controversy has tapped issues of culture and of gender, pitting friend against friend, Hasidim against Lithuanian Jews and women against men.</p>
        <p>Observant Orthodox Jews do no work on the Sabbath, from sunset Friday to sunset Saturday. That includes not carrying anything in a public area, like keys, wheelchairs, strollers and even children, unless there is an eruv.</p>
        <p>The Borough Park controversy began soon after the first small eruv was built in the heart of the neighborhood last October, to aid a Hasidic teenager who uses a wheelchair.</p>
        <p>Hasidic Jews in wheelchairs typically hire non-Jews to take them to synagogues on the Sabbath, because their family members are not allowed to push them or to carry them up and down stairs. But last fall, when the man hired to take the teenager to and from services missed several appointments, the boy's father asked his rabbi, Chaim L. Katz, for help. Rabbi Katz authorized an eruv to be built in blocks adjacent to his synagogue near 15th Avenue and 44th Street, allowing the teenager's father to take him to Sabbath services. In the months that followed, more and more families asked to be included within the eruv.</p>
        <p>''The eruv is the best thing to come along since instant chicken soup,'' said Bassi Weber, a Hasidic Jew and the mother of three, including a 12-week-old boy.</p>
        <p>Borough Park has about 250,000 Jews, the largest concentration of Jews in the country and one of the most Orthodox in the world. The debate over the eruv has attracted the attention of Hasidim and other observant Jews worldwide, said Rabbi Gershon Tannenbaum, director of the Rabbinical Alliance of America.</p>
        <p>More than 225 blocks in Borough Park are enclosed in the eruv. Along the border of the neighborhood, fishing line can be seen strung over alleyways and across streets, either attached to buildings or to poles. Small ribbons flutter on many of the strings, a signal to passers-by that the eruv is intact.</p>
        <p>By creating a symbolic doorway in the wall around the neighborhood formed by attached houses, the fishing line transforms a public area, like a street, into a private one, at least for religious purposes.</p>
        <p>The residents most active in building the eruv said their efforts had enabled families to enjoy the Sabbath better. Many Orthodox families in Borough Park have five or more children, and women with infants and toddlers are effectively shut in their house from Friday night until Saturday sunset if they cannot carry their children outside.</p>
        <p>''The people seeing the biggest benefit are the young mothers who used to be locked up in the house,'' said Rabbi Efraim Blumenberg, the president of the Eruv Society of Boro Park. ''Now you see them going out. The whole world is opened up for them. The benefit is so strong it overshadows everything.''</p>
        <p>Although it was men who put up the first small eruv in the neighborhood last year, it was women who pushed for its expansion and greeted it with enthusiasm. That includes Mrs. Weber, who says scholars can argue over the eruv all they want, but as long as her family's rabbi continues to say it is kosher, she will use it.</p>
        <p>Until this year, Mrs. Weber said, she was stuck in the house on Saturdays, unable to visit friends or to take her children to the park. Now, each Shabbos, Yiddish for Sabbath, she has been able to entertain her children and to take warm food to her 80-year-old aunt who is in a Borough Park hospital within the eruv.</p>
        <p>''Before they put up the eruv, by the time Saturday night came I wanted to run out of the house,'' Mrs. Weber said. ''My kids would say, 'Oh, no, not Shabbos again.' Now it's like, 'Wow, it's Shabbos. Are we going to go outside?' ''</p>
        <p>Some residents have argued that the eruv also enables Orthodox Jews to celebrate the Sabbath better, allowing them to concentrate on prayers and not worry about whether they have left something in their pockets.</p>
        <p>''I've lived here for 31 years and I feel totally different, now I can bring a prayer book to synagogue,'' said Pinchas Shor, a Borough Park plumber.</p>
        <p>Many of the rabbis opposed to the eruv see themselves as standing firm against religious liberalization. The eruv, they fear, could lead to more egregious violations of the Sabbath, like buying items on credit.</p>
        <p>''It cheapens the Sabbath, it makes it look like a weekday, and that is not something we want to see,'' said Rabbi Shaul Bick, whose father, Rabbi Moshe Bick, was a leading opponent of an earlier proposal to build an eruv. ''People could abuse it.''</p>
        <p>Rabbi Bick said he did not want to appear unsympathetic to women with children, but he contended that part of keeping the Sabbath holy was to make sacrifices. The solution for homebound women is not to use an eruv and risk violating the Sabbath, but instead to make their husbands take over more care of the children, Rabbi Bick said.</p>
        <p>Underlying the opponents' arguments is a belief that Jewish law prohibits the use of an eruv in Borough Park. The Talmud and rabbinical decrees prohibit eruvs in cities of more than 600,000 people, in places where roads run straight through town and in areas with numerous shopping districts, Rabbi Bick and others say. Marketplaces and main thoroughfares are public areas by nature, while 600,000 is the number of men ages 20 to 50 the Talmud says were with Moses at Mount Sinai, and therefore serves as the definition of a large city. All of those restrictions apply to Brooklyn, eruv opponents have said.</p>
        <p>In 1978, some of Borough Park's most respected rabbis proclaimed that Brooklyn did not meet the conditions necessary to allow an eruv. And others, including 68 rabbis who signed a statement opposing the eruv, contend that that ruling cannot be ignored.</p>
        <p>''It's a question not to be dealt with by amateurs,'' said Rabbi Yisroel Belsky, who opposes the eruv. ''They are popularizing a matter of religious law. It's like taking a serious medical question and putting it to a vote.''</p>
        <p>There are long-standing eruvs in Flatbush, Park Slope, the Upper West Side and other neighborhoods where modern Orthodox families live. There have been complaints about eruvs in other communities, but those were usually from people concerned that their community was becoming too Orthodox.</p>
        <p>Borough Park's eruv is the first large-scale eruv in a mostly Hasidic New York city neighborhood.</p>
        <p>An eruv had never before been built in Borough Park in large part because of the influence of Lithuanian sects in the neighborhood. Lithuanian Jews were the first Orthodox Jews to move to Borough Park in large numbers, beginning in 1910. Like the Hasidim, Lithuanian Jews wear black hats and are religiously observant. But Lithuanians come from a different religious tradition, one that does not as readily embrace the use of eruvs, particularly in cities.</p>
        <p>Many of the Hasidic groups that moved to Borough Park in the late 1950's came from cities in Poland and in Hungary where eruvs were widely used. Nevertheless, the Lithuanian rabbis remained influential enough to scuttle earlier proposals for eruvs. Today, with the best-known of the earlier Lithuanian rabbis dead, and with Hasidic Jews making up about 85 percent of Borough Park's Jewish population, the balance of power may have shifted.</p>
        <p>The neighborhood's leading Lithuanian rabbis, including the Bick family, remain opposed. The largest Hasidic sects in Borough Park, Bobover and Satmar, have followed that lead. But other Hasidic groups, like Belz, Munkatch and Viener, have embraced the eruv, disregarding the admonitions not to build it. Supporters of the eruv, including Assemblyman Dov Hikind, have urged the opponents to simply ignore the fishing line and allow those who want to use it to carry in peace. But the rabbis opposed to the eruv say that it is wrong for them to remain silent.</p>
        <p>''It's a potential violation and it is not in keeping with the spirit of the Sabbath,'' Rabbi Bick said. ''Any violation of the Sabbath is considered a desecration.''</p>
        <p>Manifestations of the debate are all over the neighborhood. The front of Rabbi Katz's synagogue, for example, is plastered with letters written in Yiddish defending the legality of the eruv in Jewish law. Still, it is difficult to tell which side is winning the debate. On Saturday afternoons, there are far fewer baby carriages on the sidewalks than there are on other days of the week. But there are some, and that is a major change.</p>
        <p>Borough Park is a neighborhood that protects its privacy. And the public debate has made many residents uncomfortable, especially because it has highlighted divisions between people who ordinarily live together in harmony. But some, including Rabbi Tannenbaum, say the debate is good for Borough Park.</p>
        <p>''Everyone is looking to learn from what happens here,'' Rabbi Tannenbaum said. ''Heaven should grant that this level of interest exists on every aspect of Jewish law.''</p>
