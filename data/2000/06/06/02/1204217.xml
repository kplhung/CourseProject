        <p>True North Communications in Chicago said yesterday that it would realign its health care agency operations. The reorganization mirrors the changes made in September at its two principal advertising agency operations, Bozell Worldwide and FCB Worldwide.</p>
        <p>FCB Healthcare in New York becomes the lead global health care agency network, just as FCB Worldwide has become the lead agency network, by absorbing several offices of Bozell Global Healthcare in cities like Costa Mesa, Calif.; Brussels; and Melbourne and Sydney, Australia. FCB Healthcare will now have 250 employees and revenue estimated at $53 million from clients like Glaxo Wellcome.</p>
        <p>Bozell Global Healthcare in Fort Lee, N.J., will continue operating, but now as a smaller, second health care agency brand for True North. John Loden, 53, president and chief executive at FCB Healthcare, becomes chairman and chief executive at the expanded FCB Healthcare. Nick Maiale, 57, chairman and chief executive at a sibling, Wellness Worldwide in Fort Lee, becomes president and chief executive at Bozell Global Healthcare; Daria Blackwell, who had been president there, resigned, the agency said. Wellness Worldwide is being absorbed by FCB Healthcare and Bozell Global Healthcare.</p>
