        <p>The struggles of Chicago public schools seem a world removed from North Side College Preparatory, a gleaming new high school with six computers in every classroom, a 525-seat theater and a student body loaded with academic stars.</p>
        <p>In the hallways between classes one recent morning, a stereo system serenaded the students with a jazz recording by Chuck Mangione,</p>
        <p>''Land of Make Believe.''</p>
        <p>''We're like a suburban school inside the city, pretty preppy,'' said Damien Croteau-Chonka, a 15-year-old freshman who has already built a thriving business as a Web-site designer. ''We're elite academically. But if you can get in here, you belong here.''</p>
        <p>North Side College Prep, a $44 million school nearing the end of its first year, is Chicago's answer to parents who say they must look to the suburbs or private institutions for a top-notch education for their children.</p>
        <p>In truth, few suburban schools could compete with the academic bona fides of the students at North Side College Prep. The median test score for students entering the freshman class this fall was in the 96th percentile nationally.</p>
        <p>But while virtually no one disputes the scholastic prowess of North Side College Prep, some education experts and parents question the fairness of lavishing such resources on the academically gifted, especially when so many children in Chicago are desperately lagging behind in other classrooms.</p>
        <p>The Chicago system, like many, has long struggled with low test scores, attendance problems and teacher shortages.</p>
        <p>''Not all kids are born with the ability to test well,'' said Darlene Pearlstine, an elected representative to a Chicago public school governing council. ''The system is telling those kids that the other schools are for losers and rejects.''</p>
        <p>Such a notion is vehemently debated by Paul Vallas, the head of the Chicago public schools, who has been widely praised for raising test scores and restoring discipline in classrooms all over the city.</p>
        <p>In more than a dozen schools around Chicago, including several in poor neighborhoods, Mr. Vallas has instituted special curriculums for high-achieving students, known as international baccalaureate programs. ''North Side College Prep is only one small part of the picture,'' he said. ''This is about giving more options to all the families in the city.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Vallas is not backing away from the goals creating elite schools. This fall, another new top-shelf campus, the Walter Payton College Preparatory School, will open on the affluent Near North Side of Chicago.</p>
        <p>By 2001, Chicago will offer six such magnet schools for high-achieving students, including South Side College Prep, which has been in operation for two years.</p>
        <p>Kati Hancock, the director of The Education Trust, a research group in Washington that studies school issues, said there was ''no secret about what's going on here.''</p>
        <p>''As the upper-middle class has more disposable income, there is a greater pull by the private schools, and Paul Vallas is not the only school leader looking for ways to compete and keep those kids,'' Ms. Hancock said. ''There is a legitimate argument to be made that you need to keep the tax base, and you need to attract the children of influential citizens, or you lose support for public education in cities. At the same time, there is a danger that we're sending a very devastating message to the other students that we just don't care about them.''</p>
        <p>Moreover, some concerns have been raised about elite schools siphoning off the best students and the best teachers.</p>
        <p>Other big cities, including Chicago, have operated selective-admission public schools before. In New York, the Bronx High School of Science and Stuyvesant High School are geared toward the academic elite. San Francisco has the prestigious Lowell High School. Boston Latin in Boston takes only the top students.</p>
        <p>''It's not new to have these schools,'' Ms. Hancock said. ''What's new in Chicago is that they're building more of them.''</p>
        <p>Besides the money spent on North Side College Prep, and the  admission standards, some critics have also argued that the racial makeup of the school is absurdly out of proportion.</p>
        <p>In a city where white students account for just 10 percent of public school enrollment, 57 percent of the students at North Side College Prep are white. The largest minority group at the school is Asian-American, 17 percent, compared with 3 percent Asian-American citywide.</p>
        <p>Black and Hispanic students, meanwhile, are sharply underrepresented at North Side. It has 11 percent Hispanic students, compared with 37 percent citywide, and  14 percent black students, compared with 53 percent citywide.</p>
        <p>Students at North Side College Prep are admitted solely on the basis of test scores. And the competition has been fierce. For the next school year, North Side accepted about 400 students, out of some 3,000 applicants.</p>
        <p>The school has also been a powerhouse at recruiting teachers and staff members. About 400 teachers applied for 37 slots. The principal, James Lalley, spent several years as the principal at St. Ignatius College Preparatory High School, considered the most prestigious Roman Catholic school in Chicago.</p>
        <p>In the view of Mr. Lalley, the criticism about elitism at a Chicago public school underscores the progress being made in the city's educational system in recent years. He recalled the statement by William Bennett, the former education secretary under President Ronald Reagan, that Chicago schools were the ''worst in the nation.''</p>
        <p>''Chicago schools have had such a bad reputation for so long,'' he said, ''that any success for anyone is good for everyone.''</p>
        <p>Thus far, North Side Preparatory has demonstrated that it can compete with private schools. About one-third of its freshman class attended private schools last year.</p>
        <p>Aaron Kletzing, 16, had planned to attend Luther North High School, a private school, just as an older brother had done. His parents had never considered sending their children to a public school in Chicago. But when North Side College Prep opened, they changed their minds.</p>
        <p>''This place is top-notch and it's free,'' said Aaron, who is a star pitcher on the school baseball team. ''It's pretty simple. You can get a better education here than at Luther North, and you don't have to pay $5,000 in tuition.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 3, 2000, Saturday  An article yesterday about the creation of selective public high schools in Chicago misstated the surname of the executive director of the Education Trust, who discussed the reason for Chicago's action. She is Kati Haycock, not Hancock.</p>
