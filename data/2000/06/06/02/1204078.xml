        <p>''Thirteen'' was shown as part of the 1998 New Directors/New Films Series. Here are excerpts from Stephen Holden's review, which appeared in The New York Times on April 4. The film opens today at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center.</p>
        <p>David Williams's movie ''Thirteen'' belongs to a burgeoning genre that determinedly blurs the line between fiction and documentary filmmaking. Largely improvised, with no screenplay and featuring a cast that includes untrained actors as well as professionals, this portrait of a sullen, quirky 13-year-old black girl growing up in Richmond feels utterly real during much (though not all) of its 87 minutes.</p>

        <p>''Thirteen'' was shown as part of the 1998 New Directors/New Films Series. Here are excerpts from Stephen Holden's review, which appeared in The New York Times on April 4. The film opens today at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center.</p>
        <p>David Williams's movie ''Thirteen'' belongs to a burgeoning genre that determinedly blurs the line between fiction and documentary filmmaking. Largely improvised, with no screenplay and featuring a cast that includes untrained actors as well as professionals, this portrait of a sullen, quirky 13-year-old black girl growing up in Richmond feels utterly real during much (though not all) of its 87 minutes.</p>
        <p>Nina (Wilhamenia Dickens), the movie's unsmiling central character, is a tomboyish adolescent who shortly after her 13th birthday becomes withdrawn and stops speaking. One day she simply disappears from the house where she lives with her salty, God-fearing mother, Lillian (Lillian Folley), who narrates the film. When Nina reappears several days later from an autumnal trek into the Virginia mountains, she is a bit less glum than before.</p>
        <p>While she wanders through the countryside contemplating her life, Nina decides that the one thing she wants more than anything is to own a car. Much of the rest of the film follows her around as she futilely tries to earn enough money to buy one. She applies for various entry-level jobs, works as a baby sitter, cares for people's pets and sits for a portrait painted by a mediocre local artist.</p>
        <p>''Thirteen'' brings in a lot of peripheral characters, some of whom are inadequately identified. Among its more awkward moments are brief flashbacks of Nina's adventures in the woods.</p>
        <p>For all its narrative glitches and its homemade quality, ''Thirteen'' evokes the rhythm, texture and tone of Nina's world in a way that a more carefully scripted film never could. It reminds you how mysterious and complex individual character really is. Nina's obsession with cars and her way of suddenly bursting out with blunt observations and demands make a fascinating portrait of a shy, strong-willed girl whose mind is churning as she tries to figure out the world and her future.</p>
        <p>Ms. Folley's Lillian is ''real'' in much the same way. Deeply religious but not conventionally devout, Lillian is sure that she will eventually go to heaven. While the character is by no means a goody-goody, you feel that if heaven did exist, she would probably be welcomed there.</p>
