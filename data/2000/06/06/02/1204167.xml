        <p>LET suburbia's guardians wrestle with the heartache of sprawl. Jean Parker Phifer, president of New York City's endangered Art Commission, has her hands full trying to cut down on clutter in a cluttered metropolis.</p>
        <p>Perched on a stone bench with her favorite source of bubbly, the Pulitzer Fountain, spewing merry geysers nearby, Ms. Phifer enunciates the commission's nutshell mission with a vehemence one wouldn't expect from a briefcase-wielding 48-year-old architect in a quiet navy pantsuit and tortoise-shell glasses.</p>
        <p>''Hold down the clutter!'' is all she says, but her words cut across the bustling plaza like a battle cry. Here's why.</p>
        <p>As if the commission's urban mission isn't sufficiently quixotic, not to mention unremunerated, lately Ms. Phifer, a stickler for melding aesthetics and public spaces, has found her hands not just full but tied.</p>
        <p>Last week, nearly two dozen members of the City Council, annoyed by what they perceive as the commission's snooty modus operandi, lent their clout to a bill intent on killing an agency that has, for 102 years, had final say on what does or doesn't get built, renovated, relandscaped, or redecorated on city-owned property.</p>
        <p>No wonder Ms. Phifer is feeling a trifle cranky: nobody likes to hear they're poised for extinction. Especially not when they feel they're performing a public service that could mean the difference between a paved-over Central Park (''So many people want to turn it into a Rollerblade arcade!'') and a sylvan semi-wilderness that gleams like an emerald in Manhattan's geographic navel. A public service that saves landmarks like the Pulitzer Fountain (the Yale and Columbia-educated Ms. Phifer was on the team that refurbished it in the 80's) from encroachment by newsstands and neon.</p>
        <p>A public service that rejects parks proposals that feature plastic horses, and disputes -- here's the crux of the spat with the Council -- Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern's unauthorized installation of 150 flagpoles featuring military yardarms that fly his own departmental banners not only in the city's parks but at its war memorials. The commission deems this ''inappropriate,'' but some Council members embrace it.</p>
        <p>The installation so upset Ms. Phifer's predecessor, Reba White Williams, that she resigned and sued Mr. Stern, and though the matter was settled out of court, harsh feelings, and many flagpoles, linger.</p>
        <p>THAT the commission was formed in 1898 to censor an unsolicited deluge of artwork to the city (it was trendy for New Yorkers to donate statues, typically of themselves) is just another mini-irony within a fracas that has brewed since last summer and now, Ms. Phifer frets, billowed woefully out of proportion.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes just plain trees say parks better than a park plaque,'' she says. ''I believe so intensely in the rightness of what we're doing! Aesthetic quality is as important as air quality, as water quality. Everyone talks about the environment; let's talk about the built environment,'' she adds, forging into lecture-speak. ''We can't expect perfection and we certainly don't want uniformity. We're not snobs. We're just trying to keep the truly ugly from gaining ground!''</p>
        <p>Ms. Phifer describes her husband, Tom Phifer, as ''a modernist architect,'' herself as ''a preservationist by training.'' They and their two children live in an extremely modern Upper West Side apartment (his call), and weekend at an 1840ish (her call) house upstate. She didn't grow up playing with Erector Sets instead of Barbies in Bethesda, Md., but historic architecture was a passion for her father, a lawyer, and on weekends she accompanied him on sightseeing treks. She remembers his saying, ''Look at those beautiful lines,'' as he gazed at Colonials. And in her junior year at Yale, where she switched majors after an illuminating semester abroad at British restoration sites, she finally knew what he'd meant.</p>
        <p>''It was one of those moments, where the light bulb goes on and you suddenly know what you want to do with your life,'' she says. ''I wanted to get my hands dirty, build things.''</p>
        <p>After graduation, she worked as a historical architect for the National Park Service in Denver, but in 1979 she decided New York was where the action was, and before she knew it she was on a scaffold outside the 46th  floor of the Chrysler Building, mapping the cracks in its corners for an installation of expansion joints. The Chrysler remains her favorite skyscraper, but it was a succession of renovations in Central Park that got her ''hooked on public space and landscaping'' projects.</p>
        <p>She says it's her goal, before her Arts Commission presidency ends, to get the fencing removed from Central Park's reservoir and expand public access to the waterfront. But first there's that June 16 meeting in Staten Island with James S. Oddo, the Republican sponsor of the abolition bill, at Staadt Circle, the war memorial where one of Mr. Stern's flagposts is ensconced. With Mr. Oddo's blessing.</p>
        <p>Ms. Phifer says she and her fellow commissioners hope for a reconciliation through communication, but she's also a realist: if Mr. Oddo ignores her telephone overtures, will he stand her up on the 16th?</p>
        <p>''I just think it's a very sort of savage idea to try and eliminate a commission that only tries to make things more beautiful,'' she says, a tad plaintively. ''How could anybody not believe in that? It's beyond me.''</p>
        <p>PUBLIC LIVES  Correction:  June 5, 2000, Monday  A Public Lives profile on Friday about Jean Parker Phifer, president of the New York City Art Commission, misstated the number of unauthorized flagpoles installed in parks and at war memorials by the Parks Commissioner, Henry J. Stern. It is 790, not 150; 750 of the 790 came under review by the Art Commission.</p>
