        <p>Behrens, the 7-5 favorite in tomorrow's Massachusetts Handicap, was scratched yesterday after his trainer decided that his bruised left front foot was too tender to race.</p>
        <p>The trainer, James Bond, said Behrens's stablemate Pleasant Breeze would start in his place. Behrens won the race last year, ran second this year in the Dubai World Cup and had drawn the rail  for the race at Suffolk Downs in Boston.</p>

        <p>Behrens, the 7-5 favorite in tomorrow's Massachusetts Handicap, was scratched yesterday after his trainer decided that his bruised left front foot was too tender to race.</p>
        <p>The trainer, James Bond, said Behrens's stablemate Pleasant Breeze would start in his place. Behrens won the race last year, ran second this year in the Dubai World Cup and had drawn the rail  for the race at Suffolk Downs in Boston.</p>
        <p>But the 6-year-old has been ailing from a stone bruise on his foot, and yesterday, after he galloped a mile and a half at Saratoga, Bond reported: ''There was just too much tenderness there. He's just too good, too classy, to take a chance. We'll regroup now.''</p>
        <p>The Breeders' Cup on Nov. 4 is foremost. The Whitney at Saratoga on Aug. 6 is also important. Running Stag, at 3-1, now heads a field of eight in the Massachusetts Handicap.</p>
