      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Baldoria has been open less than a month, but it already feels as if it has been around for 50 years. It's the kind of Italian restaurant that New York could get a patent on, with tall booths in maroon leather, dark wood floors and the music of Frank and Dino emanating from a jukebox. You can spot the place fairly easily. It's the only restaurant in the theater district with a doorman in bow tie and sunglasses.</p>
        <p>Baldoria is the offspring of Rao's, the legendary southern Italian restaurant in East Harlem where tables are booked year-round by a small group of regulars.</p>

        <p>Baldoria has been open less than a month, but it already feels as if it has been around for 50 years. It's the kind of Italian restaurant that New York could get a patent on, with tall booths in maroon leather, dark wood floors and the music of Frank and Dino emanating from a jukebox. You can spot the place fairly easily. It's the only restaurant in the theater district with a doorman in bow tie and sunglasses.</p>
        <p>Baldoria is the offspring of Rao's, the legendary southern Italian restaurant in East Harlem where tables are booked year-round by a small group of regulars.</p>
        <p>The unvarying answer to requests for a reservation earned the restaurant's owner, Frank Pellegrino, the nickname Frankie No.</p>
        <p>His son, Frank Jr., is making it a lot easier on diners at Baldoria. The restaurant has two dining rooms, upstairs and downstairs, and an orthodox reservation policy.</p>
        <p>The menu is traditional and pan-Italian, with appetizers like roasted peppers, vitello tonnato, sauteed clams and a chilled seafood salad of shrimp, squid and lobster. A seasonal surprise was a very fresh salad of fava beans and wild French asparagus served with a scoop of ricotta cheese.</p>
        <p>Risotto with sliced white asparagus, a special, is outstanding. Orecchiette with sausage, broccoli rape and pepperoncini led a list of pastas that included gnocchi alla bolognese, penne in a spicy arrabbiata sauce, and ribbonlike trenette with prosciutto, peas and onions in a light cream sauce.</p>
        <p>Main courses tend to be old friends like veal piccata, osso buco, veal pizzaiola and bistecca alla fiorentina, although a nicely seared grouper, served very simply with sherry and fresh herbs, broke the spell momentarily.</p>
        <p>The wine list at present is meager. Baldoria throws some effort into the desserts, often a big letdown at Italian restaurants. Almond panna cotta, thickly luxurious, comes with an intensely flavored hazelnut ice cream, and the bitter chocolate tart, almost black, rests in a delicate, paper-thin pastry crust that, heaven forbid, seems French.</p>
        <p>At the end of the meal, Frank Jr. dropped by the table and asked, ''Is there anything we could have done to make your meal a more positive experience?''</p>
        <p>Only one thing came to mind. Drop Sade from the jukebox, and rustle up a recording of ''Relaxez-Vous'' by Dino.</p>
        <p>Baldoria, 249 West 49th Street, Manhattan, (212) 582-0460. Dinner entrees, $15.50 to $32.</p>
