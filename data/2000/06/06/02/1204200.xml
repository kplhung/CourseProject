        <p>On tour, they call Karol Kucera Little Cat, and down the stretch today at the French Open, Andre Agassi looked as defenseless as a goldfish in a bowl.</p>
        <p>There will be no repeat of last year's emotional journey at Roland Garros Stadium. No theatrical bows and kisses blown to all corners of the court. No hands clutching head in stunned delight. No communion with the Parisian public.</p>
        <p>Agassi turned escape into an art form here on his way to the 1999 title, but this year it was Kucera's turn to twist free of the ropes, dispatching the top-seeded player, 2-6, 7-5, 6-1, 6-0, in the second round and sending a shock wave through the refurbished center court.</p>
        <p>It has been a disastrous first week for American tennis stars: the second-seeded man, Pete Sampras, and the second-seeded woman, Lindsay Davenport, were both beaten in the first round.</p>
        <p>Agassi, the winner of three of the last four Grand Slam events, made it only one round further, and, as in Davenport's case, part of the explanation was physical. For Davenport, it was a wrenched back; for Agassi, a blister on his right foot. After two rounds, only Michael Chang remains of the nine American men who came to play here.</p>
        <p>Agassi served for a two-set lead at 5-4 in the second, but at 15-15 he dumped an ill-advised and poorly struck drop shot in the net. He then got the worst of a cross-court forehand exchange with Kucera and, on the next point, missed a backhand passing shot to lose his serve and his edge. Kucera soon broke his serve again -- with Agassi making unforced errors on the final two points -- to even the match at one set apiece.</p>
        <p>''That gave me a lot of confidence,'' Kucera said. ''He had the whole match in his hands and suddenly it's one set all.''</p>
        <p>After Kucera jumped out to a 4-1 lead in the third set, Agassi returned to his chair, pulled off his right shoe and sock and summoned the trainer Per Bastholt. Apparently, the blister had started bothering him late in the second set. Bastholt wrapped Agassi's big toe and treated the sole of his foot, where a new blister had developed.</p>
        <p>Agassi did not win another game. He lost 11 in a row, as Kucera confidently smacked groundstrokes to the corners. Agassi proved as incapable of keeping up on the court as he later proved incapable of bringing himself to answer questions from the news media. He fled Roland Garros, risking a $10,000 fine.</p>
        <p>Kucera, a fluid 26-year-old counterpuncher from Slovakia with a great running forehand, had a 2-2 record against Agassi coming into the match and beat him in a testy fourth-round match at the 1997 United States Open.</p>
        <p>''Some players just have a good game for certain other players, and Karol has a good game for playing Andre,'' said Miloslav Mecir, Kucera's coach. ''He doesn't get bothered by power. He can find answers to hard shots, and he can run very, very well.''</p>
        <p>Kucera was ranked eighth in the world at the end of the 1998 season, and he might have finished in the top 10 again last year if not for a sore right wrist that kept him from playing for six weeks in the summer.</p>
        <p>According to Mecir, the former United States Open finalist whose nickname, the Big Cat, inspired Kucera's, his pupil decided to change the type of string on his racket at the end of last season in an attempt to alleviate the chronic pain in his arm.</p>
        <p>''He thought it would be gentler on the arm, but the problem was that he lost confidence and control of the ball,'' Mecir said.</p>
        <p>Kucera resumed using his former strings and beat Gustavo Kuerten on clay in Monte Carlo and won all four matches easily at the World Team Cup last week.</p>
        <p>In other matches, Dominique Van Roost, one day after her tear-filled upset of Davenport, squandered a 6-0, 4-1 lead and lost to Marta Marrero of Spain in three sets. Anna Kournikova, the No. 14-seeded woman, was eliminated by Sylvia Plischke of Austria, 6-2, 4-6, 6-3. Kournikova's inconsistency against Plischke was caused, in part, by the torn ankle ligament she sustained three weeks ago.</p>
        <p>A more surprising upset was the Argentine qualifier Agustin Calleri's four-set victory over 14th-seeded Dominik Hrbaty, Kucera's Slovak Davis Cup teammate. Marat Safin, the 20-year-old Russian, survived his grueling encounter with Andrew Ilie of Australia after Ilie retired with cramps in his legs and right arm while trailing by 0-5 in the final set.</p>
        <p>Stefan Koubek of Austria was unable to finish his match for a different reason. While trailing Attila Savolt of Hungary, 3-6, 7-5, 6-0, 5-2, he was disqualified after throwing his racket in anger and hitting a ball boy. Koubek said he never intended to strike the youth.</p>
        <p>''I'm angry with myself that it went this far, but it happened and now I can't change anything,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Neither can Agassi.</p>
