        <p>HAVE you noticed how poorly the New York Yankees have been doing since their self-proclaimed No. 1 fan, the mayor, cast off his mantle of invincibility and became the diffident, love-is-all-you-need fellow we now see? To someone who is as much a lifelong Yankees fan as Rudolph W. Giuliani, this is cause for concern.</p>
        <p>Consider this. On May 10, when the mayor announced that he and his wife were bound for Splitsville, the team stood comfortably in first place, having won well over two-thirds of its games. Since then, it has lost two-thirds of the time and slipped to second place.</p>

        <p>HAVE you noticed how poorly the New York Yankees have been doing since their self-proclaimed No. 1 fan, the mayor, cast off his mantle of invincibility and became the diffident, love-is-all-you-need fellow we now see? To someone who is as much a lifelong Yankees fan as Rudolph W. Giuliani, this is cause for concern.</p>
        <p>Consider this. On May 10, when the mayor announced that he and his wife were bound for Splitsville, the team stood comfortably in first place, having won well over two-thirds of its games. Since then, it has lost two-thirds of the time and slipped to second place.</p>
        <p>Coincidence? If you say so.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Giuliani has repeatedly made a package deal of his City Hall successes and the brilliant Yankees of recent years. So if he now presents himself as a mere mortal, flawed and vulnerable, can that augur well for the Bronx ball club? Sure, a gentler mayor is nice to have around. But if a byproduct is a disastrous year for the Yanks, die-hard fans will inevitably wonder whether the trade-off is worth it.</p>
        <p>Call this a reach. But it is not much more implausible than the jarring softening of Mr. Giuliani's public persona.</p>
        <p>For a columnist who was out of commission for a few weeks tending to family matters, parachuting back into the New Rudy's New York feels a bit like stumbling into the final reel of ''Invasion of the Body Snatchers.'' Only instead of everyone being soulless, touchy-feely is suddenly in.</p>
        <p>The first instinct was to race home to see if someone was slipping giant pods under beds. But a journey to City Hall seemed to make more sense, to see the man up close.</p>
        <p>He was different, all right.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, he swore in two Family Court judges, and went on to talk about how terrific all judges were and how he had ''great respect'' for them. The last time Mr. Giuliani was heard on the subject of judges, the word from him that stuck in memory was ''jerky.''</p>
        <p>At his daily news conferences, Wednesday and yesterday, he spoke in a soft voice, even while deflecting questions clearly intended to get a rise out of him.</p>
        <p>Mind you, Mr. Giuliani is no different from many other politicians in finding it handy when things go wrong to blame the news media and their supposed biases. But it is also undeniable that some reporters love to bait him at every turn, much like an annoying child at the zoo who jabs at a caged bear with a stick, hoping to get it to growl.</p>
        <p>For now, the Zen Mayor is not taking the bait.</p>
        <p>''It's boring,'' one of his press corps tormentors complained.</p>
        <p>NATURALLY, there is debate about whether the mayor is truly transformed or merely wearing a good-guy mask. Skeptics note that he had promised before to mend his surly ways, only to fall off the kindness wagon.</p>
        <p>But even if the personality change is short-lived, why not take advantage of it? Boring can sometimes be good.</p>
        <p>It wouldn't hurt the press corps, or New York as a whole, to give the mayor a pass for a while and focus on other aspects of governance. Ignoring him completely would be hard. This is such a mayor-centric city that, whoever he is, little can get done without him. But the absorption with Mr. Giuliani (and this columnist is far from blameless in this regard) is sometimes over the top. Surely, other things are happening in and around City Hall that merit a gander.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani has contributed to the problem by insisting that the spotlight always shine on him and by giving his commissioners precious little leash. How many New Yorkers can name anyone in the upper echelons of local government, other than maybe the highly publicized men in charge of the police and the parks? The mayor has rarely allowed commissioners -- and by extension, their issues -- to take center stage, even on a matter as mundane as the pre-Passover survey of matzo prices.</p>
        <p>The suspicion is that most New Yorkers wouldn't mind a break, a belief that deepened Wednesday night while watching Mr. Giuliani hold a ''town hall meeting'' in Red Hook, Brooklyn. For an hour, he fielded two dozen questions on local concerns like the closing of a day care center, heavy truck traffic, waste transfer stations and inadequate housing.</p>
        <p>Prostate cancer was mentioned only once, in passing. Judith Nathan's name came up not at all. Imagine! New Yorkers actually have other things on their minds.</p>
        <p>Perhaps, in the age of the New Rudy, they will have a chance to focus more on what really troubles them. That and how to keep the Yankees from going down the tube.</p>
