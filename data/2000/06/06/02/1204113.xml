        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I was part of a bipartisan delegation of former members of Congress that visited Cuba in 1996, and we reached the same conclusions as Representative George R. Nethercutt Jr. in ''What's Good for China Is Good for Cuba'' (Op-Ed, May 26). A second such delegation last year also agreed.</p>
        <p>With the Soviet withdrawal of support in 1989, Cuba went from being a dagger at our throat to an orphan on our doorstep. The Cubans, rarely the object of our disinterested solicitude over the past century, deserve and welcome the chance to interact with us in every possible way.</p>

        <p>I was part of a bipartisan delegation of former members of Congress that visited Cuba in 1996, and we reached the same conclusions as Representative George R. Nethercutt Jr. in ''What's Good for China Is Good for Cuba'' (Op-Ed, May 26). A second such delegation last year also agreed.</p>
        <p>With the Soviet withdrawal of support in 1989, Cuba went from being a dagger at our throat to an orphan on our doorstep. The Cubans, rarely the object of our disinterested solicitude over the past century, deserve and welcome the chance to interact with us in every possible way.</p>
        <p>When my delegation asked some  dissidents how America could improve life in Cuba, they said, ''Send a flotilla of cruise ships down here, and let the passengers fan out over the entire island.'' The chemical reaction, they said, would bring change far more readily than our current policy.</p>
