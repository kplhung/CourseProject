        <p>Through June 10</p>
        <p>The small black-and-white pictures in this show mark a transition in Robert Mapplethorpe's early career. He had already produced work that incorporated images clipped from porn magazines. With these Polaroids, his first photographs, he created his own erotica using himself as a model.</p>
        <p>The pictures move from shots of empty bedsheets, suggesting blank canvases, to others of the artist nude, in bondage gear, his face sometimes visible, sometimes not. Together they form an up-close, masturbatory sequence, about narcissicism and self-arousal, the atmosphere of voyeurism intensified by the small size of the pictures and by the illicit connotations that surrounded the automatic printing process.</p>

        <p>The small black-and-white pictures in this show mark a transition in Robert Mapplethorpe's early career. He had already produced work that incorporated images clipped from porn magazines.

        <p>The pictures move from shots of empty bedsheets, suggesting blank canvases, to others of the artist nude, in bondage gear, his face sometimes visible, sometimes not. Together they form an up-close, masturbatory sequence, about narcissicism and self-arousal, the atmosphere of voyeurism intensified by the small size of the pictures and by the illicit connotations that surrounded the automatic printing process.</p>
        <p>At the same time, so much of what qualified as ''underground'' in the 1970's has since come above ground that the pictures no longer carry much of a shock. Their primary interest, as Richard D. Marshall points out in an exhibition essay, is historical.</p>
        <p>They brought a transgressive charge of homoerotic sexuality to 1970's body-oriented art, one that would have important repercussions in the 1990's. And they document a raw, oddly vulnerable moment in the development of Mapplethorpe's own work, before self-conscious artfulness began to dull its edge.</p>
