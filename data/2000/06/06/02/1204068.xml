        <p>''Bloomsbury'' is  the nickname  never sought by those directly concerned -- for a group of friends and sometime lovers who began to see one another in or near Gordon Square in London in 1910. They included Virginia Woolf; her sister, the painter Vanessa Bell; Clive Bell, the critic and author of ''Art'' (1914); Roger Fry, the originator of two historic post-Impressionist exhibitions in London, in 1910 and 1914; the painter Duncan Grant, the economist J. M. Keynes and the essayist and biographer Lytton Strachey. They stayed together not as a self-promoting ''group,'' but as people who never tired of one another's company.</p>
        <p>''The Art of Bloomsbury'' is the largest and most complicated loan exhibition ever mounted at the Yale Center for British Art here. What we see is a very large and tightly focused exhibition, but it is much more than that. In an almost subliminal way it gives us the freedom of a certain Britain in the first half of the 20th century. This was a time in which a handful of people provided the model of a civilization in which old ideas were called in question and new ones put quietly forward.</p>

        <p>''Bloomsbury'' is  the nickname  never sought by those directly concerned -- for a group of friends and sometime lovers who began to see one another in or near Gordon Square in London in 1910. They included Virginia Woolf; her sister, the painter Vanessa Bell; Clive Bell, the critic and author of ''Art'' (1914); Roger Fry, the originator of two historic post-Impressionist exhibitions in London, in 1910 and 1914; the painter Duncan Grant, the economist J.

        <p>''The Art of Bloomsbury'' is the largest and most complicated loan exhibition ever mounted at the Yale Center for British Art here. What we see is a very large and tightly focused exhibition, but it is much more than that. In an almost subliminal way it gives us the freedom of a certain Britain in the first half of the 20th century. This was a time in which a handful of people provided the model of a civilization in which old ideas were called in question and new ones put quietly forward.</p>
        <p>At the heart of it were three high Victorian families: the Stracheys, the Stephens and the Frys. Lytton Strachey, with his ''Queen Victoria'' (1921), pioneered the case for biographies that had something pertinent to say in every line but that did not go on forever. His brother, James, made the first translation into English of the complete works of Freud.</p>
        <p>Their sister, Dorothy, married a French painter, Simon Bussy, and was for many years a close friend of Andre Gide. Henri Matisse, a former classmate of Bussy, was their friend and neighbor near Nice. Anyone who thinks that Bloomsbury lacked bite need only look at Bussy's little portrait of Lady Ottoline Morrell in the present show.</p>
        <p>Duncan Grant, a pre-eminent figure in the Yale show, was a cousin of the Stracheys and went to school with the poet Rupert Brooke. Men and women alike fell for him on sight until he was well into his 80's.</p>
        <p>The second Bloomsbury family were the Stephens. Virginia Woolf, the novelist, and Vanessa Bell, the painter, were the daughters of Sir Leslie Stephen, the first editor of the British Dictionary of National Biography.</p>
        <p>Roger Fry's father, Sir Edward Fry, ended his legal career as a Lord Justice of Appeal and his sister Margery was principal of Somerville College, Oxford. He himself had been for a while at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where he was responsible, among other things, for the purchase of Renoir's ''Charpentier Family.''</p>
        <p>These were high Victorian families, but they were not at all stuffy. ''Uncensorious'' is the word for Lady Strachey's attitude to the often wayward antics of her children. Nor did her descendants forget her. Some 50 years ago, when I first went to the Stracheys' house in Gordon Square, I found that the name-board in the hall still bore the names of Sir Richard and Lady Strachey. Though long dead, they were simply marked ''Out,'' as if they had just gone round the block.</p>
        <p>And now, on the title page of the catalog for ''The Art of Bloomsbury,'' we find Vanessa Bell, painter; Duncan Grant, painter; and Roger Fry, critic, painter, designer and mesmeric lecturer on the history of art.</p>
        <p>More than 200 paintings, drawings and sculptures are on view. There are enough autograph letters (none of them perfunctory) to give an interested visitor a long and happy day's reading. (A magnifying glass will help.) There are photographs by the dozen, and not one of them is dull.</p>
        <p>Anyone who knew Leonard Woolf as a widower, quietly fading away, will be amazed by the photograph that emphasizes the trenchant virility that he radiated at the time of his marriage to Virginia Woolf in 1911.</p>
        <p>There are also headsets on which one can call up recorded memories by veterans of the Bloomsbury scene. There are relevant books and manuscripts by members or near-members of Bloomsbury: Virginia Woolf, above all, but also Leonard Woolf, E. M. Forster and Keynes.</p>
        <p>We see the books published by Leonard Woolf under the imprint of the Hogarth Press. Unmistakable Bloomsbury book jackets (mostly designed by Virginia Woolf) also abound. And there are pieces of furniture made at the Omega Workshops, which were directed from 1911 to 1918 by Fry.</p>
        <p>Almost everyone in Bloomsbury agreed with the philosopher G. E. Moore that ''loving friendship'' and esthetic enjoyment were ''the supreme goods.'' From 1910 onward a ''loving friendship'' is clearly present in many of the portraits on view.</p>
        <p>Beginning with Grant's portrait of Keynes (1908), a great many of them are clearly love-tokens. Same-sex love affairs ran throughout the history of Bloomsbury, though significant reversions to heterosexuality could happen at any moment and sometimes led to genealogical havoc.</p>
        <p>And the art? To begin with, the dedicated organizer, Richard Shone, gives the lie to the long-running opinion that Fry's paintings are not worth looking at. Fry's paintings of French landscape in 1912-13, and even more his wonderfully lively and truthful portraits of Iris Tree (1915) and Edith Sitwell (1918), have a candor and a directness that still take us by surprise.</p>
        <p>Bell and Grant were loving companions for half a century, and she had a daughter by him in 1918. But in their work, their selves remained separate. Grant always had surprises to spring, from the hauntingly beautiful abstract image that he painted in 1915 in memory of Rupert Brooke to the apotheosis of contentment that smiles out at us in his ''Vanessa Bell at Charleston'' (1917). Bell, by contrast, could always make something memorable out of plain things and plain places, even as early as 1912 with her ''Monte Oliveto.''</p>
        <p>The art of Bloomsbury was a conversational art, in which high drama remained latent. (Grant put more drama into his ''Parrot Tulips,'' from about 1912, than into any of the paintings that relate to his own life.) Nor were these artists competitive, either with one another or in the market. They did their own thing, in their own way, and they knew that it was part of a world of new books, new poems and new points of view in which they would always have a place.</p>
        <p>''The Art of Bloomsbury'' is at the Yale Center for British Art, 1080 Chapel Street, New Haven, (203)432-2800, through Sept. 3. In conjunction with the show there will be a two-day symposium (June 16 and 17); performances of ''Vita and Virginia,'' a play about Virginia Woolf and Vita Sackville-West written by Eileen Atkins (5:30 p.m. on June 20 and 21); and a program about the composer Ethel Smyth (5:30 p.m., June 22).</p>
