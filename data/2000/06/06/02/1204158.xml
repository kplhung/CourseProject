        <p>Outplayed by the Knicks' Charlie Ward for much of the Pacers-Knicks series, Mark Jackson has reasserted himself as an offensive weapon in the Eastern Conference finals. The player who once used his rump to back down every guard smaller than himself toward the rim ended with 11 points and 7 assists and no turnovers in Game 5, dropping in his jump hook and making himself an option again.</p>
        <p>''I've been letting guys off the hook not doing it as much as I should have,'' Jackson said yesterday. ''And I made a conscious effort last night to do just that. I didn't want to have the season end and think about, 'Man, I should have posted more.' Like last summer. So going into the game, I knew right away I had to be aggressive and take advantage of my strengths.'' Coach Larry Bird said, ''We got have not only assists from Mark Jackson, but we got to have some points and rebounds, too.'' Reggie Miller said: ''I know he's fifth all-time in assists, but when he can get the smaller guards down there on the post, he makes it that much easier.''</p>
