        <p>Editorial scores Jon Corzine campaign's use of private detectives to investigate opponent Jim Florio in New Jersey Senate race</p>

        <p>Opposition research has long been common in political campaigns, and it sometimes leads to mudslinging and unfair attacks. But the recent use of private investigators to search for compromising information turns a tough but acceptable practice into a dangerous trend. Even a political neophyte like Jon Corzine ought to know better.</p>
        <p>The Corzine campaign's use of private detectives in the New Jersey Senate race, first reported in The Philadelphia Inquirer, became known after $200,000 in payments to a prominent New York lawyer, Stanley Arkin, showed up in a campaign spending report. Asked about the payments, Mr. Corzine's aides confirmed that part of the money had been used to pay for private detectives who were making inquiries about Mr. Corzine's opponent, former Gov. Jim Florio, and members of Mr. Florio's staff.</p>

        <p>In 1992 Bill Clinton, then governor of Arkansas, used detectives to arm his White House campaign with dirt to throw at women whose only mistake was their personal association with the future president. That set an unhealthy precedent, and the Corzine campaign erred in following it. The bad publicity forced Mr. Corzine to order an end to the detectives' inquiries. He should follow up with an apology to Mr. Florio and the voters.</p>
