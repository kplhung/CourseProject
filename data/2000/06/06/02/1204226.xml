        <p>Fourth graders throughout New York State performed remarkably better this year in the second year of a more rigorous reading and writing test, with 59 percent passing compared with 48 percent in 1999, education officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Even in New York City, which has long lagged considerably behind suburban and upstate school districts, 42 percent of fourth graders passed the test, up from only 33 percent last year. All of the city's 32 community school districts noted improvement on the test, which was introduced last year to help prepare students for state graduation requirements being phased in over the next four years.</p>
        <p>Richard P. Mills, the state education commissioner, said the results bolstered his high-profile effort to toughen standards throughout the state's schools and to hold students accountable through more demanding standardized tests. But Mr. Mills and other educators acknowledged that the failure rate was still disturbingly high, with 41 percent of the state's fourth graders still not reading and writing at grade level.</p>
        <p>''One significant increase is not nearly enough,'' Mr. Mills said in an interview. ''Everything depends on follow-through over a long period of time.'' Others cautioned against reading too much into the improved scores, pointing out that this was only the second year of the new test. It is not unusual for scores to be strikingly low in the first year a test is given, then rise in the second year as students and teachers grow more comfortable with the test.</p>
        <p>''It's always advisable to look at long-term trends and not get too excited about short-term changes,'' said Robert Berne, vice president for academic affairs at New York University.</p>
        <p>Last year's results horrified parents and teachers not only in New York City, but in many wealthy suburban schools whose students had always scored exceptionally well. Those districts showed the same substantial improvement as New York City this year. In Westchester County, 73.1 percent of students passed this year, compared with 61 percent in 1999. In Nassau County, the percentage of passing students jumped to 77 percent from 65 percent. And 71 percent of Suffolk County's fourth graders passed this year's test, compared with 58 percent last year.</p>
        <p>There was, however, one less-than-optimistic note. The sharpest increases in New York City, which aggregated data by race, were among white and Asian students, who make up only 16 percent and 11 percent, respectively, of the city's 1.1 million schoolchildren. The scores of black and Hispanic students in New York City improved less significantly, with only about 6 percent achieving the highest level of proficiency.</p>
        <p>Education officials shed little light on why the fourth graders fared so much better this year, saying only that students were spending more time reading and writing, and that teachers were finally devising methods that worked. In addition, principals have been ''studying data like crazy'' and determining effective strategies for helping slow learners, Mr. Mills said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mills and Harold O. Levy, the New York City schools chancellor, acknowledged that schools were ''teaching to the test,'' but said they were doing so only by requiring children to spend more time on basics.</p>
        <p>''This test is not something you can drill for,'' Mr. Mills said in an interview. ''There is nothing to memorize, unless you count punctuation and grammar. The only way to prepare for these tests is to read a lot and write a lot, and certainly there is a tremendous amount of that going on.''</p>
        <p>But other educators said that teachers were spending more time having their students read short passages for comprehension and answering questions about them. In some schools, the educators said, those drills were taking time away from reading full books.</p>
        <p>''You can drill kids in reading and writing in ways that don't develop their literacy skills as much as they should,'' said Norman Fruchter, director of the Institute for Education and Social Policy at New York University. ''The more they focus on quick comprehension of short passages, the more the notion of narrative and context gets lost.''</p>
        <p>Students took the test in three parts, over three days in February. In the first part, they read passages of literature and poetry and answered multiple-choice questions. In the second, they listened to a long passage of literature, took notes and wrote about what they had heard.</p>
        <p>The final part involved reading two articles and writing different kinds of essays about them. Students were evaluated not only on reading and writing, but on spelling, grammar and punctuation. Committees of teachers graded the written sections.</p>
        <p>In one exercise, students read a two-page interview with an artist, then wrote a newspaper article encouraging people to attend one of the artist's exhibitions. In another, the teacher read a story called ''Spaghetti,'' about a lonely boy who finds a kitten that smells of noodles. The students took notes, then answered questions. Afterward, they wrote an essay explaining how the boy had changed over the course of the story.</p>
        <p>Scores on the test were grouped into four levels. Students whose scores were in Levels 3 and 4 performed at or above the state standards for reading, writing and listening, while those in Levels 1 and 2 failed to meet the standards or, worse, demonstrated no evidence of proficiency. Education officials could not provide data on exactly how many schools failed to improve at all. But they said that 85 percent of the state's elementary schools either had students move from Level 1 to Level 2, or had students who failed last year move into Levels 3 and 4 this year.</p>
        <p>But educators were mindful that test scores have sometimes been recalculated after the discovery of mistakes in grading or scoring. Thousands of students were consigned to summer school last year on the basis of a city test that was later found to have been incorrectly scored.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy, who became New York City's interim chancellor in January and was appointed to the job permanently last month, said the credit for this year's improvement belonged to Rudy Crew, who was chancellor from 1995 through 1999.</p>
        <p>The city's schoolchildren showed only slight improvement on standardized tests during Dr. Crew's tenure, and in some years, test scores actually fell.</p>
        <p>Dr. Crew often said it would take years for the long-troubled system to make significant gains. Yesterday, Mr. Levy echoed that belief.</p>
        <p>''Educational changes do not take place in a flash,'' Mr. Levy said in a news conference at the Board of Education headquarters in Brooklyn. ''If the improvement we are seeing this year continues, then this is a very meaningful day.''</p>
        <p>For the second year, District 26 in Bayside, Queens, and District 2 in Manhattan ranked first and second among city districts. District 31 on Staten Island showed the most extraordinary improvement, with 40 percent more students passing this year than in 1999. The chancellor's district, which consists of 40 failing schools, had the lowest scores, followed by District 9 in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy invited five district superintendents to his news conference and had them discuss teaching practices that they thought had played a role in improving the test scores. The superintendents said that ongoing in-school training for teachers had been crucial. They also credited intensive reading programs like Success for All, and defended the emphasis on testing.</p>
        <p>''To tell kids that tests aren't important is to sell them short, to cheat them,'' said Vincent Grippo, the superintendent of District 20 in Brooklyn. ''It's a tough reality. But it's a reality we all have to learn to live with.''</p>
        <p>The scores are available at www.emsc.nysed.gov/irts/home.html, a site on the Internet.</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 6, 2000, Tuesday  An article on Friday about fourth graders' performance on a statewide reading test misidentified the New York City district in which scores rose most sharply. It was District 33, a citywide unit with 3 elementary schools and 10 middle schools reporting to the chancellor rather than to a community school board; it was not District 31 on Staten Island.</p>
        <p>A chart with the article misstated the improvement in Irvington, N.Y., since 1999. It was 4 percentage points, not 14.</p>
