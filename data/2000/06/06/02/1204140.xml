        <p>Transportation officials in New Jersey asked the federal Environmental Protection Agency today for more time to fully implement a rigorous system for checking auto emissions, citing continuing problems at smaller inspection stations.</p>
        <p>James Weinstein, the transportation commissioner, and C. Richard Kamin, director of the Division of Motor Vehicles, acknowledged that the tougher emissions test would not be ready at all 32 state-operated inspection stations by the June 30 deadline set by the E.P.A. They have asked for an extra month to prepare for the change at seven smaller stations: hiring 70 more technicians and supervisors, expanding inspection hours and taking appointments to prevent long waits for drivers.</p>
        <p>But both state officials and the environmental agency pointed out that progress had been made since the inspection system's disastrous debut in December. The $450 million system, which is operated by a private vendor, the Parsons Infrastructure and Technology Group, has been plagued by equipment breakdowns and staff shortages from the start, forcing angry drivers to wait as long as five hours to have their cars checked.</p>
        <p>The delays caused such a furor that Gov. Christine Todd Whitman suspended the tougher emissions tests at roughly half the inspection stations in January, allowing them to bring back the older, less time-consuming system during the transition. Currently, nine stations -- primarily those with only one or two inspection lanes -- still have not gone completely back to the new system.</p>
        <p>Mary Mears, a spokeswoman for the E.P.A., said today that the agency was likely to approve the request for a one-month delay to Aug. 1. ''We don't have a problem with this proposal, but we need to get it in writing,'' Ms. Mears said. ''They've fixed about all the inspection lanes, and they've done a good job of it, and we have every reason to believe they're going to get the last ones.''</p>
        <p>But William Dressler, executive director of the New Jersey Gasoline Retailers Association, said that he had written a letter to the E.P.A. opposing the delay, and that if it was approved, he might challenge it in court. His association represents 1,400 private garage owners who have each invested more than $50,000 in equipment to conduct the new emissions test.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dressler said that his members would continue to lose business as long as drivers continued to have the option of taking the less rigorous test at the state-operated stations. ''We're competing against the simpler test,'' he said. ''To me, that's putting us at a distinct disadvantage because my members don't even get a shot at those customers.''</p>
        <p>The new emissions test takes 11 to 15 minutes, compared with 5 minutes for the old test, a crucial difference that would most likely create long lines at the smaller stations. ''When you have a single lane and a lot of people show up, you can't just divert them to another lane,'' said Carl Golden, a spokesman for the Parsons company.</p>
        <p>In a separate development, state transportation officials today also announced further delays in the installation of the E-ZPAss toll collection system on the Garden State Parkway and the New Jersey Turnpike. The work is expected to be completed in September instead of this month because of construction problems and heavy summer traffic, the officials said.</p>
