        <p>The shooting death of a presidential aide Wednesday is being widely interpreted here as a political attack on the West-leaning government.</p>
        <p>Goran Zugic, 39, the security adviser to President Milo Djukanovic of Montenegro, was gunned down outside his home shortly after 11 P.M. His slaying follows several high-profile killings in Serbia but is the first such death in Montenegro, Serbia's smaller partner in the Yugoslav federation.</p>
        <p>As such, it has stunned the population here and shaken the government, which has been trying to steer a peaceful course away from Belgrade's control and the isolationist policies of Yugoslavia's president, Slobodan Milosevic.</p>
        <p>The timing, just a week ahead of local elections in which pro-Milosevic parties are pitched against the Montenegrin government and its allies, raised speculation that it was an attempt by Belgrade to destabilize the political process. ''It looks like a terrorist act against democracy and against the security of the people,'' President Djukanovic said today at a memorial service.</p>
        <p>He and other officials said the killing had all the hallmarks of assassinations in Serbia. Several prominent Serbs have been killed in recent  months, including the paramilitary leader Zeljko Raznatovic and Defense Minister Pavle Bulatovic.</p>
