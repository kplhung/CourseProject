        <p>Don't look now, says Viktor Petukhov, but that Russian economy the world wrote off as a basket case two years ago is roaring back to life.</p>
        <p>He is certainly right about the roaring part.</p>
        <p>Inside a peeling salmon-colored stucco building near the center of this otherwise quiet town, Mr. Petukhov, the director of the Vologda Textile Enterprise, stood one recent day and surveyed the ear-splitting success he has wrought. Around him, a hundred mechanical looms clack-clacked in deafening unison, spitting miles of linen onto spools as big as car axles.</p>
        <p>He said linen sales leapt by 50 percent last year and would grow by a third or so more this year. This from a company that was bankrupt and rudderless just four years ago.</p>
        <p>''There's growth everywhere,'' he said. ''All we need now is stability and some government understanding of the problems.''</p>
        <p>This is Russia's not-quite-open secret: the crash of 1998, the meltdown that wiped out Russia's middle class and turned the Kremlin into a global deadbeat, is over.</p>
        <p>Its devastating aftereffects -- a sharply devalued ruble, the disappearance of imports, a government cut off from addictive foreign loans -- turned out to be fuel for an economy that had simply run out of gas. A landscape littered with bankruptcies two years ago now sprouts hundreds of Vologda Textiles.</p>
        <p>The question is whether that comeback is real and gaining strength, or will run out of steam.</p>
        <p>The Kremlin casts it as real, if shaky, and the numbers look promising. Industrial production through April was 10.3 percent greater than the same period in 1999. Russian exports jumped 50 percent. The average worker's salary, a meager $73 a month, nevertheless was up 7 percent in March over a year ago.</p>
        <p>Companies and the government have begun to pay workers months and even years of back wages. Inflation this year is expected to run about 13 percent, far below the 1999 rate. Investment in new equipment and buildings is rising for the first time in a decade.</p>
        <p>Most promising, Russia's budget now runs a primary surplus -- that is, it has money left after domestic spending to pay some of its foreign debt. In Washington in May, President Vladimir V. Putin's chief economic adviser told President Clinton that the Kremlin no longer needed to secure new foreign loans just to pay its old ones.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin now announces the good news personally, as in April when he disclosed a higher-than-expected increase in economic growth in the first quarter. By recent Russian standards, he boasted, ''this is enormous growth.''</p>
        <p>He cautions, and experts agree, that it cannot last absent basic economic reforms. He already has proposed wholesale changes in taxes, including a flat income tax and corporate tax cuts, and despite concerns that the wealthy would benefit most, the changes appear to have strong support. Mr. Putin promises to announce equally sweeping changes in June. If they become law, his advisers say, Russia's economy should grow by roughly 5 percent a year, and inflation should fall steadily.</p>
        <p>Other top government forecasters are less cocksure. They agree that the economy is reaping the economic windfall of the 1998 crisis. The problem, they say, is that the windfall has now been more or less exploited, and there is little to take its place.</p>
        <p>''In the second part of this year, the positive influences will mostly be over,'' said Aleksandr Frenkel, the chief macroeconomics forecaster at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Economics Institute. ''And the influence of negative factors -- low investment, a foreign payments crisis, a low standard of living -- may significantly influence economic growth.''</p>
        <p>Eduard F. Baranov, the first deputy chief of the government's Economic Research Center, says Russia's boomlet has been confined mostly to raw-materials exports and light industries like food processing and textiles. Major industries have mostly been left behind.</p>
        <p>Companies like Vologda Textiles ''are like little plants that give us hope,'' he said. But they are not the architects of basic reform that the economy needs.</p>
        <p>''We still have the mentality of the old Soviet plan, when we didn't have to think about sales or quality or lowering expenses,'' he said. ''We have to rebuild our organization at the molecular level. And it's going to take a long time.''</p>
        <p>The bears say the glowing statistics look a lot different when Russia's performance is compared with the months before the August 1998 crash instead of the depressed months after it. Investment so far this year is surely greater than last, they allow, but it still is only 92 percent of that during early 1998.  Workers' real income is substantially higher than a year ago. But it remains barely 77 percent of what is was in 1998, and that translates into a lower standard of living.</p>
        <p>''Wages haven't returned yet to their pre-crisis level,'' Mr. Baranov said. ''And while salaries have increased, they have risen at a lower rate than prices.''</p>
        <p>A Russia that poor is hard put to generate enough domestic demand to make the economy grow. The statistics bear that out, Mr. Frenkel says: exports are driving the recovery, accounting for more than $8 of every $10 of growth in the gross domestic product.</p>
        <p>Russian exports have boomed because the fallen ruble has made them exceptionally cheap while economic growth elsewhere has driven up demand. But most are raw materials -- timber, chemicals and especially high-priced oil. Exporting consumer goods is unrealistic; most remain too shoddy or poorly marketed. Some of those same goods have prospered at home because of another crisis-borne opportunity: the chance to fill the gaps on store shelves after the ruble's crash made foreign products too expensive.</p>
        <p>But those gaps have been largely closed. To keep growing, companies now must attract new buyers -- no easy task in a nation whose products are not ready for export, and whose citizens are too poor to buy anyway. In fact, exports have slowed this year, and industrial output fell in April. So did the measure of business managers' confidence in the future.</p>
        <p>All that seems at odds with the brimming orders at Vologda Textile and its kin. But in more than a few ways, Vologda Textile epitomizes the economy's two-steps-forward, one-step-back quality. Like the rest of Russia, this place has come a long way in the last few years, yet still has miles to go.</p>
        <p>For 38 years after its founding in 1953, Vologda Textile was a worry-free place. Its 5,000 workers had state-guaranteed jobs. The bottom line was no concern: the state bought the output, too. In its heyday, the factory churned out 22 million square meters of linen a year.</p>
        <p>But when Communism fell in 1991, Vologda Textile followed the rest of Russian industry into a black hole. The government hastily privatized it. Harebrained schemes that followed included a switch from making textiles to making jeeps. By the mid-90's, the company was bankrupt.</p>
        <p>Vologda's regional government finally intervened, and in 1998 it dispatched Mr. Petukhov, a dour furniture-factory manager to clean up the mess. A mess it was, too. Workers had gone unpaid for three years. With a crippled factory for their product, farmers had stopped growing flax, and cultivation had plummeted to a paltry 6,000 acres in 1998 from 200,000 in the early 90's. Exports were a fantasy: the ancient looms produced only 100-centimeter linen in a world market that bought only cloth 150 centimeters wide.</p>
        <p>That said, Vologda Textile had some advantages. For one, Russia was posed to prosper in the world textile business, if only it could control costs.</p>
        <p>''In Europe, the textile industry is shutting down,'' Mr. Petukhov said. ''Labor costs are very expensive in Europe, and fabrics produced in Europe are very expensive.'' The centers of textile production, he said, have been moving east to Russia, Ukraine and elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Also, the region's government was already pushing the sorts of economic reforms that Mr. Putin is pressing on Parliament. The region's new governor, Vyacheslav Y. Pozgalev, exempted businesses from all taxes, provided they poured the savings into their companies. He lent flax farmers money and equipment. And he gave Vologda Textile a break on electricity prices, and a hefty order of linen to get it back on its feet.</p>
        <p>It also helped that clothing is one of life's essentials. ''When people's income fell after the crash, lots of them became poor,'' Mr. Frenkel said. ''And when you're poor, all you can afford is food and clothes.''</p>
        <p>The crash of '98 solved Vologda Textile's competitiveness woes: almost overnight, the ruble's plunge made its linen four times cheaper to foreign buyers. Nationally, textile production shot up 20 percent in 1999, even as other industries struggled.</p>
        <p>But none of that might have helped had the factory not bootstrapped itself into profitability. The work force was slashed to 1,300, ending the featherbedding that was a staple of Soviet factory life. The government shut the monolithic trade agency that marketed textiles abroad, so Mr. Petukhov began hawking his wares at trade shows in Milan, Paris and New York.</p>
        <p>As in most Russian industry, new equipment was too expensive. So over a year, workers rebuilt 400 looms to produce 150-centimeter fabric and fired up a foundry to make hard-to-get spare parts.</p>
        <p>The result of all the changes: Vologda Textile will sell six million meters of linen this year -- well below its totals of old, but enough to make a profit. Next year, the goal is eight million meters.</p>
        <p>Exports have rocketed to 80 percent of sales, with Italy and the United States the primary customers. Mr. Petukhov also has paid off back wages. That helped workers, who make 31 to 46 cents an hour -- $50 to $70 a month -- for mind-numbing and unhealthy work. ''American workers would never work for such wages,'' Mr. Petukhov grumbled.</p>
        <p>On the assembly line, 37-year-old Tatyana Naidyonova, an apron covering her Harley-Davidson T-shirt, paused from cleaning a machine with kerosene and agreed. ''It's not much money,'' she said. ''But where else can you get any more?'' Raises will have to wait until the plant can sell more and better linen.</p>
        <p>Governor Pozgalev says private investors -- this time with experience -- could buy the factory by year's end. His eventual goal, and Mr. Petukhov's, is to move from a supplier of basic cloth to a producer of more profitable dyed and refined fabrics, and eventually to make and export clothes.</p>
        <p>''We have only to solve the problem of the quality of our material and little by little increase the volume,'' Mr. Petukhov said. ''What's needed is that in Russia we produce as much as possible, and buy as little as possible abroad.''</p>
        <p>That is a long way away. The factory still faces basic problems and Soviet mind-sets at every turn. One example: linen production is severely crimped by the supply of local flax, which is in turn limited by the state's utter failure to replace Soviet-style collective farming and sound management. So Vologda Textile has been forced to buy higher-priced flax from Belgium, France and the Netherlands -- which, in turn, is slapped with a 15 percent customs duty. That raises Vologda Textile's costs, and lowers sales.</p>
        <p>The factory also has to navigate the Gordian customs office, which inexplicably follows the factory's processing of imported flax into cloth even after the duty is paid and the reedy plant is made into thread.</p>
        <p>The factory is peppered with tags on various machines reserving them exclusively for imported flax under customs supervision. Asked why, Mr. Petukhov said drily: ''We have a bureaucracy in this country. You probably have one in America, too.'' That may be solved soon; local flax production should jump by two-thirds, to 25,000 acres, next year.</p>
        <p>For now, though, Vologda Textile must import some 40 percent of its raw material from Europe. That lifts costs. But it is a change that Mr. Petukhov savors.</p>
        <p>''For once,'' he said, ''we're importing our raw materials from the West, instead of the other way around.''</p>
