        <p>Gov. George W. Bush criticized the Clinton-Gore administration today for an approach to land conservation that he said involved too much federal muscle and too little local flexibility. Instead, he proposed using federal resources and incentives to coax state governments and private citizens into greater conservation efforts.</p>
        <p>Against a carefully chosen backdrop of snow-crowned mountains, gargantuan pine trees and the astonishingly blue waters of Lake Tahoe, the Texas governor presented his plan as an illustration of what he said was his deep commitment to preserving natural splendors like the one he was visiting.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush proposed spending a modest amount of money, calling for an additional $2.3 billion in federal spending on conservation efforts over the next five years. But he emphasized that much of that money would be channeled to local governments or used for programs that would encourage private landowners and private groups to take a more aggressive stewardship of the land and water around them.</p>
        <p>''We have a national consensus about the importance of conservation, but critical problems arise when leaders reject partnership, when they rely solely on the power of Washington and the regulations and penalties and dictation from afar,'' Mr. Bush told scores of local residents who gathered here.</p>
        <p>''Unfortunately,'' he said, ''this is exactly what we have seen for the last seven years. We've seen millions of acres of land declared off limits and designated as national monuments just like that, with no real public involvement, no regard for the people affected by these decrees.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said the proposal he made today would help remedy that. It called for an increase in the annual allocation of money for the federal Land and Water Conservation Fund to $900 million from its current level of $500 million. That represented an additional investment of $2 billion over five years.</p>
        <p>The plan would set aside half of that money for state and local conservation efforts. Mr. Bush also proposed tax incentives for private landowners to sell their property to conservation groups and estimated that the lost federal revenue from the measure would be about $300 million over five years.</p>
        <p>Today's speech followed, by only two days, a major address on conservation by Vice President Al Gore, in which Mr. Gore promised to prohibit logging and road building on 43 million acres of undeveloped national forests. It was a pledge that went beyond the currently stated intentions of the Clinton administration.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush did not mention or criticize that proposal specifically, but his remarks suggested that he would be much more reluctant than Mr. Gore to use federal power to declare wilderness areas off limits without the support and cooperation of the people who used and lived near them.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's speech today was his second this year on environmental issues, which the Gore campaign sees as one of the governor's prime vulnerabilities. By several important measures of environmental health, Texas ranks near or at the bottom of the 50 states, although Mr. Bush's aides say the situation has been improving steadily over the five years that he has been governor.</p>
        <p>Based on Mr. Bush's remarks today, several environmental advocates expressed concern that his approach would be too permissive and hands-off and that the results would be the endangering of pristine land and water.</p>
        <p>''The American people want a clean and safe environment, and it sounds like George Bush said today he would not use the tools available to give it to them,'' said Dan Weiss, the political director of the Sierra Club, an environmental advocacy group in Washington.</p>
        <p>Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for the Gore campaign, rejected Mr. Bush's implicit portrayal of the vice president as someone without concern for local sentiments when it came to protecting land and water, and said Mr. Gore believed strongly in working with local residents on conservation efforts.</p>
        <p>With his proposal today, Mr. Bush was doing more than simply asserting concern about conservation. He was again casting the November presidential election as a contest between the view that Washington has the best solutions and the belief that people outside of Washington do.</p>
        <p>''Somehow,'' Mr. Bush said, ''the mentality of Washington is: 'We know better. We know better than the citizens of this great state. Let us think on behalf of the citizens,' goes the thinking. It's time to have new thinking in Washington, D.C.''</p>
        <p>As an illustration of that thinking, Mr. Bush said he wanted to devote $50 million annually from the land conservation fund to provide matching funds for states that develop programs to give private landowners assistance for conservation efforts.</p>
