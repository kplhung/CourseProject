        <p>Rallying Round To Get Out Votes</p>
        <p>Now is the time for all good television personalities to come to the aid of voter-registration drives.</p>
        <p>''We always complain about what we don't like; I do it too, but I vote,'' said the syndicated talk-show host QUEEN LATIFAH, who videotaped a commercial promoting online registration at www.beavoter.com, a nonpartisan site sponsored by the American Association of Retired Persons, America Online and MCI WorldCom.</p>
        <p>The NBC News correspondent JANE PAULEY made voter registration a priority of her principal-for-a-day duties at the High School for Leadership and Public Service in Lower Manhattan in April. The fallout lasted longer than 24 hours. She went back last month with SCHOOLS CHANCELLOR HAROLD O. LEVY and challenged him to expand the program.</p>
        <p>''He thinks it's a great idea,'' said PAM McDONNELL, a spokeswoman for the chancellor, noting that senior Board of Education officials had met with high school superintendents on Tuesday to talk about distributing voter-registration kits citywide.</p>
        <p>At the High School for Leadership, 52 of the 70 students who were old enough to vote have now registered. ''It definitely hit the right chord with the chancellor,'' Ms. Pauley said. ''I think he's quite a believer, and so am I.''</p>
        <p>Wit, Witticisms And Wifely Woes</p>
        <p>''I thought it was going to be witticisms,'' DEBORAH ROBERTS said, recalling her reaction to reading the manuscript of ''Don't Make Me Stop This Car,'' by her husband, AL ROKER. ''I said, 'Al, this is about us.' I had no idea he wanted to talk about us.''</p>
        <p>What followed, she said at a publication party last night at Fresco, a restaurant on East 52nd Street, was ''our little editing process.'' What did she object to? ''The first three chapters,'' she said. They cover fertility counseling, home pregnancy tests and a miscarriage.</p>
        <p>What was deleted? ''It wasn't like whole chapters came out to make me more comfortable,'' she said, explaining that the changes largely involved personal details. ''Even though I live a rather public life,'' said Ms. Roberts, a correspondent for the ABC News magazine ''20/20,'' ''I'm a rather private person.''</p>
        <p>Literary Lions And a Library Cow</p>
        <p>Bovine silliness hit the New York Public Library yesterday. Well-known authors stopped by to sign images of their books that EDWINA SANDYS, an artist who is Winston Churchill's granddaughter, had painted on a life-size fiberglass cow. The images looked pretty much like the spines of the books lined up on bookshelves, which Ms. Sandys conveniently also painted.</p>
        <p>So JOHN BERENDT signed ''Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,'' BEL KAUFMAN signed ''Up the Down Staircase,'' and ARLENE DAHL (''Always Ask a Man'') said she was sure she was the only person in the room who had ever milked a cow.</p>
        <p>''I did it too,'' Ms. Sandys piped up. ''My father bought a farm in Hampshire when we were teeny-weeny.'' He also bought three-legged stools for everyone in the family.</p>
        <p>JILL SPALDING (''Blithe Spirits: The History of the Cocktail'') was paying close attention to whose books were where on the fiberglass cow's body -- that is, who had books placed over the prime cuts. ''I think I did,'' she said. ''Poor John Berendt. He said he got the osso bucco.''</p>
        <p>A High-Priced Fashion Claque</p>
        <p>KENNETH COLE, who was nominated for men's wear designer of the year by the Council of Fashion Designers of America, will have a cheering section of sorts at an awards ceremony at Lincoln Center on June 15. Mr. Cole spent $25,000 to buy 1,000 tickets that will be given to students. ''Kenneth just tries to support fashion reaching out to more than just the fashion community,'' a spokeswoman said. MARC JACOBS and HELMUT LANG were also nominated in that category; Mr. Lang was nominated for women's wear and accessories as well.</p>
        <p>Digging Through Texts, Not Relics</p>
        <p>As a boy, ELIOT WEINBERGER thought he would be an archaeologist when he grew up, excavating Aztec or Mayan ruins. But a pamphlet led him to translate some of the works of the Mexican poet and essayist Octavio Paz. ''Through a series of coincidences, my translations were sent to Paz himself,'' he said. Paz was ''unaware that he was dealing with a teenager,'' Mr. Weinberger said. ''I typed the letter.'' Paz asked him to translate a book of prose poems, and they began a long and close collaboration. Paz, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1990, died in 1998.</p>
        <p>''I would often tell friends that the Octavio I knew was the man who once spent an hour with me looking for my lost cat,'' Mr. Weinberger said on Wednesday after receiving the Mexican Order of the Aztec Eagle, the highest decoration that the Mexican government can bestow on a non-Mexican, at the Mexican Cultural Institute on East 39th Street.</p>
