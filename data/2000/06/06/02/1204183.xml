        <p>This is a 30-second commercial that the Conservative Party of New York has begun broadcasting in Albany and on New York 1 News in New York City. It is the first to include Representative Rick A. Lazio since he announced his candidacy for the United States Senate two weeks ago.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Warfield &amp; Co.  ON THE SCREEN -- The commercial, dubbed ''Snapshots,'' begins with a montage of black-and-white photographs showing a boy on a swing; a portrait shot of Mr. Lazio, his wife, Patricia, and their two young children; clammers at the shore; two men in a store; schoolchildren boarding buses at a school; Mr. Lazio observing children working at computers. ''They could be snapshots from any New Yorker's life,'' the narrator says, as the images fade from one to the other, with soft music in the background, ''or they could be from Rick Lazio's own photo album.'' In fact, most of the pictures are not. Only two belong to the congressman: the family portrait (the picture is shown in black-and-white and in color at different times) and the one in which Mr. Lazio poses with schoolchildren at computers. The rest are generic, ''stock photos'' that advertising agencies use to represent an idea. The 'snapshot' images are followed by glimpses of grass along the water, men in blue work shirts, and a group of schoolchildren, while the narrator speaks of Mr. Lazio's interest in the environment, small business and education. It ends with a shot of Mr. Lazio and his family, in color.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- ''They could be snapshots from any New Yorker's life. Or they could be from Rick Lazio's own photo album. Summers clamming in the tides of Long Island. Growing up helping in his dad's auto-parts store. He and his wife sending their daughters to local public schools. Now working for the values he's lived by: Protecting the environment, helping small business, improving education. Rick Lazio. Made in New York. A message from the Conservative Party, fighting for New York's values.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- Mr. Lazio is a native New Yorker, born in West Islip, N.Y., and residing in Brightwaters, both in Suffolk County. While he has consistently supported tax cuts and incentives to help businesses, his record on education and the environment is mixed. On the campaign trail Mr. Lazio notes his support for the so-called Education Flexibility Partnership Act, or Ed Flex, a bipartisan bill passed by the House last year and signed into law by President Clinton that authorizes states to grant waivers to local school districts that want to spend federal dollars in ways that differ slightly from the specifically intended purpose. But Mr. Lazio also voted in 1995 on a budget plan that called for eliminating the Education Department. On the environment, he has voted against Republican bills to relax clean water regulations and strip the Environmental Protection Agency of enforcement power, but environmentalists have faulted him for supporting legislation that would cut funds for some environmental programs in the coming years.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- The ad never mentions that Mr. Lazio is a congressman or that he is the Republican nominee for the Senate. That may be because the ad, which cost $10,000 to produce and $50,000 for air time, was financed with soft money, the largely unregulated contributions to political parties that are supposed to be used for the party, not for individual candidates. Michael Long, the chairman of the Conservative Party, said that the ad ''happens to be legal and is part of the process and it doesn't say elect or vote for anyone. That's not what it's about. It's about party building. We could have used any New Yorker; we used Rick Lazio.''</p>
