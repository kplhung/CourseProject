        <p>The Prudential Insurance Company of America, the largest life insurer in the United States, has tentatively agreed to take a stake in the Kyoei Life Insurance Company, one of Japan's many faltering life insurers.</p>
        <p>The two companies announced this afternoon that they had signed a memorandum of understanding aimed at giving Prudential roughly a 20 percent stake in Kyoei, while the Japanese insurer will receive a cash infusion of up to 30 billion yen, or about $277 million at current exchange rates.</p>
        <p>The deal is effectively a rescue package for Kyoei. Its ability to meet obligations and cover losses was rated among the lowest of Japan's life insurers as of November. At that time, there was a 70 billion yen gap between what Kyoei had promised to pay policyholders and returns it received on investments.</p>
        <p>''Kyoei started having financial difficulties and came to us to see if we could help them,'' said Kiyo Sakaguchi, executive vice president of Prudential and head of its Japanese operations.</p>
        <p>Japan's life insurance companies are all struggling, burdened by policies sold during the economic boom years that promised a high rate of return. With the economy mired in weakness for much of the last decade and interest rates at record lows, they cannot now make enough on their investments to cover those obligations.</p>
        <p>Over the last three years, three Japanese life insurers have failed, and foreign companies have bought four others. On Wednesday, Japan's regulators forced Daihyaku Mutual, Japan's 15th-largest life insurer, to quit the life insurance business.</p>
        <p>But while Prudential is acting as a white knight, its stake in Kyoei will not entitle it to a management role. ''Our objective is not to take over Kyoei but to help them with financial support and technical support,'' Mr. Sakaguchi said.</p>
        <p>Prudential would become Kyoei's largest shareholder, however, and as such, might even play a role in the nascent movement here to increase the awareness and influence of shareholders in corporate Japan. ''I do see that trend developing, but it may take a little while before shareholders here really assert their position,'' Mr. Sakaguchi said.</p>
        <p>The two companies will also form a marketing joint venture to sell a combination of their insurance policies as well as other investment products. Prudential's sales and training model will be used in hopes of making the sales force more professional. Traditionally, selling life insurance has been a part-time job for housewives in Japan.</p>
        <p>Prudential will also lend an investment expert to Kyoei to help the Japanese insurer find strategies to improve its return on investments.</p>
        <p>The companies said they hoped to cut costs and increase efficiency by eliminating redundant operations.</p>
