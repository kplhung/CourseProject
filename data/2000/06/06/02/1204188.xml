      <block class="full_text">
        <p>A federal appellate panel today upheld the right of immigration officials to let Elian Gonzalez's father take the boy back to Cuba.</p>
        <p>A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta, ruled unanimously that the Immigration and Naturalization Service had the power to decide that only a parent can act for such a young child in immigration proceedings.</p>
        <p>The decision let Juan Miguel Gonzalez move a step closer to taking his son home, though the panel barred Elian from leaving the United States for at least 21 days to give his Miami relatives, who had sought asylum for the boy, time to appeal the decision.</p>
        <p>The ruling is seen as a solid defeat for the relatives who took him in after a failed crossing from Cuba drowned his mother and 10 others and left the boy floating on an inner tube off the Florida coast on Thanksgiving Day. They remained angry and defiant. In Miami's Little Havana section, where Elian had become an icon, there was anger, but the city was quiet.</p>
        <p>Elian's father was elated.</p>
        <p>''I want to thank the American people,'' Mr. Gonzalez told reporters  in Washington, where he and his son are staying. ''I hope we can finally go home.''</p>
        <p>The judges said that while they might make the opposite decision, the law gave wide discretion to the immigration service in such cases and the powers of the executive branch should be respected.</p>
        <p>''This case, at first sight, seems to be about little more than a child and his father,'' the panel wrote in their decision. ''But, for this court, the case is mainly about the separation of powers under our constitutional system of government.''</p>
        <p>That plain language, some legal experts said, would make a successful appeal difficult.</p>
        <p>''This is a very important step in achieving the goal we have sought from the very beginning, to give Juan Miguel and his family the opportunity to return to a life together,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said.</p>
        <p>But the Elian case has involved more than a family. It has drawn international attention -- not all of it good -- to Miami and its powerful Cuban-American community, stirring resentment among the city's other ethnic groups and leading to turmoil in city hall. It also brought Ms. Reno under intense criticism for her handling of the case in her hometown of Miami.</p>
        <p>The 33-page ruling upheld a decision by a Federal District Court judge in March that Elian was too young to comprehend a complicated asylum application, and that his father's rights to take him home outweighed the desires of the boy's Miami relatives to keep him here.</p>
        <p>The decision was written by Judge J. L. Edmondson, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan, and was joined by Judge Joel F. Dubina, an appointee of President George Bush, and Judge Charles R. Wilson, an appointee of President Clinton.</p>
        <p>The three-judge panel found that the immigration service was ''within the outside border of reasonable choices'' in denying the child's asylum application, which he had signed in a childlike scrawl, ''ELIAN.''</p>
        <p>David Abraham, a professor of immigration law at the University of Miami, said the panel recognized ''the conservative traditions of respecting the separation of powers and recognizing that Congress has delegated the authority to make the calls in tough cases'' to the immigration service.</p>
        <p>''The court found that I.N.S. was not arbitrary in what it did,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The family was, as of this evening, weighing its options. But some form of appeal seems likely. The family can ask for a rehearing of the case by the same three-judge panel, or appeal the decision to the full 11-judge 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, or appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>''We have not concluded, we're going to keep fighting for Elian's freedom,'' said Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's great uncle and the man who defied federal orders to give up the boy.</p>
        <p>His defiance led to a raid on April 22 in which federal agents removed the boy from the uncle's home and took him to Maryland, where he was reunited with his father. Father and son are now staying in Washington in a home owned by an international youth organization.</p>
        <p>As for whether there are grounds for an appeal, Kendall Coffey, a lawyer for the family, said the ruling ''did not constitute a resounding endorsement of the way I.N.S. handled this matter.''</p>
        <p>The appellate panel did, in fact, write that ''the court neither approves nor disapproves the I.N.S. decision to reject the asylum application filed on plaintiff's behalf.'' But, the judges wrote, the immigration service did not contradict federal law.</p>
        <p>Gregory B. Craig, the lawyer representing Elian's father, said it was time for the Miami relatives to give up their battle to keep Elian. ''It is now time to end this chapter of Elian's life and to let this family go in peace,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Outside the house in Little Havana where Elian lived for almost five months, news of the ruling drove several women to their knees on the narrow asphalt street. Men wept outside the house, a shrine of sorts here in the Cuban section of Miami, even though Elian's Miami relatives are no longer staying there.</p>
        <p>''I'm hurt,'' said Bienvenido Comas, 27, a City of Miami engineer. ''I cried today. But I have no more tears.''</p>
        <p>Like many here in a city dominated politically, economically and culturally by Cuban-Americans, Mr. Comas said he had been disappointed again and again in this emotionally charged case that led to protests and angry divisions between the city's ethnic groups.</p>
        <p>But there were no violent outbreaks in the city, even in the heart of Little Havana, where protesters had burned dumpsters and tires and clashed with the police after the raid. The police made more than 300 arrests then.</p>
        <p>This time, there was only sadness and disillusionment on Southwest Eight Street, Flagler Street and outside the tiny walkup cafes that usually buzz with political talk.</p>
        <p>''Today's a gloomy day,'' said Jose Portonado, an artist who lives in Little Havana. ''This was our last hope.''</p>
        <p>But the return of Elian to Cuba is still, more than likely, at least a few weeks away, and perhaps longer.  The precise timing remains uncertain, depending on what appeal the Miami relatives seek.</p>
        <p>The appeals panel said that a previous injunction they issued to keep Elian in this country during appeals remained in force until the panel issued a mandate to enforce today's ruling. Such a mandate would not be issued until seven days after the case was effectively closed under federal appellate rules. The panel shortened the usual 45-day period to formally close the case to 14 days.</p>
        <p>That means the Miami relatives have just 14 days to appeal the case.</p>
        <p>If the family wants to appeal the case directly to the Supreme Court, their lawyers must seek a separate order staying Elian's departure from a Supreme Court justice or the entire court.</p>
        <p>If the family does not appeal, which is unlikely, the mandate to enforce the order will be filed in 21 days.</p>
        <p>In Miami, political and legal experts said the Elian affair would not do Miami any good if it was prolonged even more. ''The case demonstrated that the overwhelming majority of Americans were not prepared to have distant relatives kidnap a child from his relatives as a way of continuing a 40-year-old struggle that means less and less to them every day,'' Mr. Abraham said.</p>
        <p>But here, where hatred of Fidel is still fresh, Cuban-Americans cannot stand the thought of returning the child to a Communist government.</p>
        <p>In Germany, President Clinton said he was pleased with the court's decision. ''As I have said before, this is a case about the importance of family and the bond between a father and son,'' Mr. Clinton said in a written statement from Berlin, the second stop on the president's European tour. ''I have supported the Justice Department's conclusion that Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, is the one best suited to speak for his child.''</p>
        <p>And in Atlanta, Vice President Al Gore said he continued to believe that a family court should decide Elian's case. George W. Bush, campaigning in Nevada, said Mr. Gore should urge Mr. Clinton to allow such a family court hearing.</p>
        <p>Lazaro Gonzalez said the family has no choice but to keep fighting any way it can. ''We are going to keep searching for the laws that Elian is entitled to,'' he said. ''So that Elian Gonzalez remains in a free country, as his mom wished.''</p>
