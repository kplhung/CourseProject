        <p>The hopes that many Cuban-Americans had harbored for Elian Gonzalez were overtaken by fears once again today when they learned that a federal appeals court had rejected his Miami relatives' effort to win him an asylum hearing.</p>
        <p>From the streets of Calle Ocho to the empty, shrinelike house in Little Havana where Elian had lived with his great-uncle Lazaro and other kin, people were subdued but disappointed, quietly grieving over the latest setback in a story that has mirrored many of their own personal tragedies of families divided by 90 miles and the roiling waters of conflicting ideologies.</p>
        <p>Outside the house today, a small crowd gathered around a portable radio. Hearing news reports of the court's ruling, people screamed, ''No, no!'' Others sobbed, and some collapsed in anguish on the sidewalk.</p>
        <p>''What is the Statue of Liberty for?'' said one man.</p>
        <p>''It's a joke,'' someone nearby responded.</p>
        <p>Despite the disappointment, the community was peaceful, in contrast to the demonstrations and sporadic unrest that ensued when federal agents took Elian from the house in April and returned him to his father. Those protests tied up traffic and led to some arrests.</p>
        <p>Today, exile leaders repeatedly called for calm, urging people to stay home and not engage in protest. They vowed that the battle would be taken to the Supreme Court and, if necessary, to Cuba.</p>
        <p>The leader of the Democracy Movement, Ramon Saul Sanchez, a main organizer of the vast demonstrations that took place outside the Little Havana house before the federal raid, said he was organizing a protest flotilla of hundreds of boats that would sail to Cuba soon.</p>
        <p>''Our approach is to channel our energies into other ways now,'' he said. ''We are going to be taking risks, but it is the same risk that Rosa Parks took with the civil rights movement. Castro has killed so many people, and he has divided a nation.''</p>
        <p>After Elian was taken from Little Havana to be reunited with his father, Lazaro Gonzalez moved away, to West Miami.</p>
        <p>''As soon as the raid took place, the family did not feel comfortable living in that house, where they had memories of Elian,'' said one of the family's lawyers, Spencer Eig.</p>
        <p>In front of the former Gonzalez home now,  many have left flowers, balloons and posters in tribute to the boy. Elian's swing set, known as El Parque de Elian, has been taken down and moved to the new Gonzalez residence. The lawn has not been mowed. Yellow ribbons are tied to electric poles on the street. Pictures of Elian's mother, who died on the ill-fated crossing in which he was rescued, are accompanied by a message that reads in Spanish, ''Let my son live in liberty.''</p>
        <p>By the gate that was knocked down by the agents who raided the house are posters. One says simply, ''Why?''</p>
