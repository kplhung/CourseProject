        <p>Here is a listing by critics of The Times of Broadway shows that have Tony nominations and are playing this weekend (''Dame Edna'' has won a special Tony; information for the Tony-nominated ''Copenhagen,'' Page 7). Approximate running times are in parentheses. * denotes a highly recommended show.  + means discounted tickets were available at the Theater Development Fund's TKTS booth for performances last Friday and Saturday nights.</p>
        <p>Broadway</p>
        <p>''AIDA.'' Pretty much everything that's right about this Disney cartoon pretending to be a Broadway musical can be summed up in two words: Heather Headley. Playing a Nubian princess in captivity, Ms. Headley has fire, self-possession and an uncompromising sense of purpose. That is more than can be said for anyone or anything around her. ''Aida,'' which has been directed by Robert Falls with songs by Elton John and Tim Rice, seems stranded in its own candy-colored limbo, thrashing between childish silliness and civic preachiness, between campy spoof and tragic tear-jerker, between two and three dimensions. Although it is the first Disney production for Broadway not to be inspired by an animated film, it nonetheless appears to be waiting for the greater destiny of translation into a cartoon. With Adam Pascal (of ''Rent'') as the hieroglyph-stiff love interest and Sherie Rene Scott, making like a refugee from ''Beverly Hills 90210,'' as Aida's rival. The eminent set designer Bob Crowley provided the Las Vegas arcade that is passing for ancient Egypt (2:30). Palace, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212) 307-4747. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $20 to $80 (Ben Brantley).</p>

        <p>''AIDA.'' Pretty much everything that's right about this Disney cartoon pretending to be a Broadway musical can be summed up in two words: Heather Headley. Playing a Nubian princess in captivity, Ms. Headley has fire, self-possession and an uncompromising sense of purpose. That is more than can be said for anyone or anything around her.

Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $20 to $80 (Ben Brantley).</p>
        <p>* ''CONTACT.'' The most potent antidepressant available in New York. Advertising has it that this show from the director and choreographer Susan Stroman is a ''dance play,'' but that hardly captures how it makes you feel. Aided by the dramatist John Weidman and a dream ensemble, Ms. Stroman has created the unthinkable: a sexy, polished work that restores the pleasure principle to the American musical. A theatrical portfolio of three seemingly unrelated vignettes set in different time periods, with top-drawer leading performances from Boyd Gaines, Deborah Yates and Karen Ziemba, ''Contact'' uses an ingeniously selected medley of recordings ranging from Bizet to the Beach Boys. But like a classic Rodgers and Hart musical it converts the messy daily ingredients of sexual attraction and conflict into something as smoothly sweet and tart as a Key lime pie. Both the intoxication of love and the hangover of loneliness are given idealized, elegant form as ''Contact'' weaves romance from a reality we are all familiar with (2:00). Beaumont, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 and $80 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>*+ ''DAME EDNA: THE ROYAL TOUR.'' Delightfully appalling. In this evening of un relenting self-worship, Dame Edna Everage, the Australian housewife turned superstar, anoints herself the new queen of Broadway, and not without reason. The inspired conception (and alter ego) of the comedian Barry Humphries, Dame Edna combines the insufferable smugness of middle-class complacency with the insufferable smugness of stardom, turning all the world into her adoring acolytes along the way. The show, a testament to Mr. Humphries's status as a great physical comic as well as a loopy social satirist, becomes a lopsided conversation between the dominating Dame and her audience. The production's strength isn't in the jokes (which are of varying quality) but in the uninhibited relish with which they are delivered. Despite some mildly humiliating exercises in audience participation, the show becomes a gleeful, surrealist flight into a bubble-gum-pink empyrean (2:20). Booth, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $45 and $65 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>*+ ''DIRTY BLONDE.'' Stand up, boys, and take your hats off. Mae West is back on Broadway in this compact Rolls-Royce of a vehicle written by and starring Claudia Shear. Eight decades after a play with the forthright title ''Sex'' landed her in jail, West is proving that she still has the power to shock and delight. She has also, not incidentally, provided the inspiration for what is hands down the best new American play of the season. This tale of an icon and two of her idolizers (played by Ms. Shear and Kevin Chamberlin) is no evening of mere impersonation; it's not ''Mae West Tonight!'' What Ms. Shear and her director, James Lapine, have shaped is a multilayered study of the nature of stardom. Bob Stillman rounds out the protean three-member ensemble. ''Dirty Blonde'' presents one of the canniest portraits on record of that floating dialogue between celebrities and fans that remains so much a part of American culture (1:45). Helen Hayes, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6262. Tuesdays and Thursdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 and $60 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>+ ''JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR.'' People who insist that where there's smoke there's fire haven't sat through this 30th-anniversary staging of Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber's rock-opera-cum-passion play, a production in which the flame of imagination definitely burns low. This revival, which originated in Britain and is directed by Gale Edwards, features lots of acrid stage smoke, a giant cross made of high-wattage light bulbs and video images of the torture and crucifixion of its title character, played here by a passive and petulant Glenn Carter. What it doesn't have is a single original idea. The score and lyrics still pulse with a freshness and audacity, but you would be better off buying the 1970 recording (2:20). Ford, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $80 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>* ''KISS ME, KATE.'' A mouthwatering revival, with ham as the plat du jour, of Cole Porter's sybarite's delight of a musical about battling egos in show business. As presented by a preening cast led by the wonderful Brian Stokes Mitchell and Marin Mazzie, who wear a spotlight as if it were a dressing gown and vice versa, this ''Kate'' proves that ham can indeed make a banquet if the spices are zesty enough. Avoiding the attitudes that are anathema to lively revivals of vintage musicals -- reverence and condescension -- the director Michael Blakemore and the choreographer Kathleen Marshall have shaped a show that is broad, brazen and finally irresistible. The production, which doesn't seem to have a thought in its giddy head beyond entertaining us as much as it's entertaining itself, feels like one long ear-to-ear grin. The top-drawer Porter score has been beautifully orchestrated by Don Sebesky and is appetizingly sung by an ensemble that conspicuously features a sharp-edged ingenue named Amy Spanger (2:20). Beck, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $29 to $85 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>*+ ''A MOON FOR THE MISBEGOTTEN.'' Every time Cherry Jones and Gabriel Byrne make physical contact in this heart-stopping new production of Eugene O'Neill's great, elegiac love story, the floodgates open to a tide of clashing emotions. The characters they play, an earthy farm woman and a burned-out actor, are as opposite as the quick and the dead. But it is clear that each is wearing a mask that only the other can remove. What makes this ''Moon,'' lovingly directed by Daniel Sullivan, so illuminating is the extraordinary transparency of its stars: their ability to play, and display, all those layers at once. To watch Ms. Jones, Mr. Byrne and Roy Dotrice react to one another is to realize the degree to which O'Neill's last completed play is about how everyone is an actor, a deceiver by necessity. Infused with both clear-eyed observation and a warm, luminous empathy, the performance's solid three hours melt into a quick-coursing stream (2:45). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $60 and $70; $26 (at box office only) (Brantley).</p>
        <p>* ''THE MUSIC MAN.'' A show that makes you feel ridiculously happy one instant and seriously sleepy the next. The director and choreographer Susan Stroman, who created the inspired dance-musical ''Contact,'' isn't as confident in her take on Meredith Willson's jubilant story of a traveling con man who brings rhythm to the stolid town of River City, Iowa. Her transforming imagination stops when the music stops. The production has two perfectly agreeable stars in Craig Bierko, in the title role, and Rebecca Luker, as the frosty librarian who learns to melt. But you get the impression that most of the people onstage are just pretending to live in a land of corn-fed propriety and corny jokes, marking time until a production number comes along to let them show their stuff. When the show is singing or, especially, dancing, it often seems to have winged feet; when it's just talking or clowning around, those feet are flat (2:50). Neil Simon, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $40 to $85 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>*+ ''THE REAL THING.'' This immensely appealing revival of the Tom Stoppard play, from the Donmar Warehouse in London, is a rare thing even in what has been an exceptionally strong season for straight plays: an elegant comedy of infidelity filled with the sort of comebacks that people only wish they were capable of themselves. True, Mr. Stoppard's anatomy of a cerebral (and anachronistically romantic) playwright, played with all-conquering charm by Stephen Dillane, is also always subverting itself, pointing out how some things, love among them, defy glib articulation. But, ah, how articulately it manages to say so. If its structural game playing seems a tad too clever this time around, few comedies have managed to have it so successfully both ways. David Leveaux is the highly accomplished director, while the delectable Jennifer Ehle, a standout in an exceptionally polished cast, plays the self-possessed object of Mr. Dillane's affections (2:15). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $35 to $70 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>*+ ''THE RIDE DOWN MOUNT MORGAN.'' As Lyman Felt, the joyously eloquent, sexually rapacious and relentlessly self-justifying bigamist at this ride's center, Patrick Stewart makes a fine devil for a new millennium. A man who wants everything and can deny himself nothing, Lyman suffers as a result, but in the end, well, the pleasure of living his carefully maintained double life was probably worth its ultimate destruction. In intelligent and savage satire, the play makes a pretty good case for bigamy as a lifestyle choice. And it is the achievement of Mr. Stewart that such stunning amorality seems nearly reasonable. It's hard to imagine a more sympathetic creep (2:10). Ambassador, 215 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 and $65 (Bruce Weber).</p>
        <p>+ ''SWING!'' Think of this hard-smiling homage to the big-band era as ''Smokey Joe's Canteen'' and you'll know what to expect. It's the latest variation on the format of ''Smokey Joe's Cafe,'' the long-running revue that set the tone for the new breed of sanitized nostalgia fests. With its eager, limber cast moving to the gleaming sounds of a fine band called the Gotham City Gates, ''Swing!,'' which is directed and choreographed by Lynne Taylor-Corbett, is by no means the worst of the lot. And there's an infectious energy to the full-throttle ensemble numbers. But there's also a distancing quality of preciousness and little flavor of individual personalities. It's the conceptual gimmicks, which range from dancers dangling from bungee cords to a tap-dancing pajama party, that dominate. Featuring the cabaret singer Ann Hampton Calloway, whose cheerful, clean-cut and oddly suburban aura matches that of the show (2:00). St. James, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m.  Tickets: $20 to $80 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>* ''TRUE WEST.'' The season's most exciting and evenly matched slugfest. With two of this country's finest young actors, Philip Seymour Hoffman and John C. Reilly, squaring off in this superb new revival, a clean victory is impossible to call. Which is entirely appropriate to Sam Shepard's 1980 story of two brothers locked in an increasingly brutal, increasingly funny struggle for identity. Hey, it's family. Nobody wins. Mr. Hoffman and Mr. Reilly are alternating in the lead roles, and to see each in both parts is to enrich deeply your appreciation of just what good actors can do with the limited instruments known as the human body and voice. Under Matthew Warchus's pitch-perfect direction, the production makes a persuasive case for ''True West'' as a great American play. The contrast between the two versions, similarly staged but remarkably different in tone, also shows the variety that can be harvested from a work this fertile without betraying its essential nature (2:00). Circle in the Square, 50th Street and Broadway, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $65 and $67.50 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>+ ''UNCLE VANYA.'' Anton Chekhov, meet Henny Youngman. The director Michael Mayer's ill-advised new interpretation of the 1897 drama for the Roundabout Theater Company, which manages to dim even the luster of the extraordinary British actor Sir Derek Jacobi, seems determined to trace the borscht belt back to Mother Russia. This is a world of stand-up sufferers who never look more contented than when expounding on their profound unhappiness directly to the audience from the center of the stage. Get thee behind me, Stanislavski. The evening, which also features Laura Linney and Brian Murray, offers a few lightning flashes that illuminate the anguish in the forced frivolity, mostly from Sir Derek and Roger Rees. But by and large you don't believe that these noisy show-offs even know one another, much less that they are capable of inflicting deep mutual pain (2:40). Brooks Atkinson, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $45 to $65 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>+ ''THE WILD PARTY.'' The sort of evening that gives orgies a bad name. The season's second theatrical adaptation of Joseph Moncure March's Jazz Age cult poem (the first was at the Manhattan Theater Club), this shrill and feverish show seems determined to take the fun out of hedonism. Featuring pastiche songs by Michael John LaChiusa, who wrote the show's book with its director, George C. Wolfe, ''Wild Party II'' is big on letting its decadent characters suffer loudly and aggressively in the spotlight. The suffering is embodied by talented stars like Mandy Patinkin, Toni Collette (of ''The Sixth Sense,'' making a most creditable Broadway debut) and the legendary Eartha Kitt. But if ''Wild Party I'' seemed to be a party with no personalities, ''Wild Party II'' feels like a parade of personalities in search of a missing party. Actually the shows are equally effective at guaranteeing that a good time is had by no one (2:10). Virginia Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $40 to $85 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>+ ''THE GREEN BIRD.'' If the Tony Awards had a category for best performance by a piece of fruit in a musical role, there's no question which current Broadway show would provide the winner. Ditto for best performance by a masked actor denied the use of the upper two-thirds of his face. And for best use of eyelids by an oversize statue. These unlikely nominees are among the highlights of ''The Green Bird,'' Julie Taymor's alternately enchanting and tedious adaptation of Carlo Gozzi's 18th-century fable. Ms. Taymor, who directed ''The Lion King,'' here sets her sights on an adult audience with a childlike capacity for wonder. Unfortunately, her sense of the transcendent moment is much stronger than her gift for narrative, and it can feel like a long wait between miracles. Among the human cast members Derek Smith is terrific as a melancholy monarch (2:15). Cort, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. Through Sunday. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $45 to $75; $25 student rush available day of show (Brantley).</p>
