        <p>Young lovers once again danced their way into death when American Ballet Theater presented Sir Kenneth MacMillan's ''Romeo and Juliet'' on Wednesday night at the Metropolitan Opera House.</p>
        <p>Paloma Herrera portrayed Juliet, and her Romeo was Marcelo Gomes, who is new to the role this season. Mr. Gomes's Romeo was an attractive, eager youth who grew more serious and mature when he encountered Juliet. In much of the first act, Ms. Herrera made Juliet look shy, sweet and even a bit bland. But she came vibrantly alive in the balcony scene, making her bending and curving movements a sign of an almost ecstatic joy. And Mr. Gomes danced with increasing abandon.</p>

        <p>Young lovers once again danced their way into death when American Ballet Theater presented Sir Kenneth MacMillan's ''Romeo and Juliet'' on Wednesday night at the Metropolitan Opera House.</p>
        <p>Paloma Herrera portrayed Juliet, and her Romeo was Marcelo Gomes, who is new to the role this season. Mr. Gomes's Romeo was an attractive, eager youth who grew more serious and mature when he encountered Juliet. In much of the first act, Ms. Herrera made Juliet look shy, sweet and even a bit bland. But she came vibrantly alive in the balcony scene, making her bending and curving movements a sign of an almost ecstatic joy. And Mr. Gomes danced with increasing abandon.</p>
        <p>His Romeo, however, turned deliberately rigid in the second act as he stood strong and immobile, refusing to respond to the taunts of Ethan Brown's nasty Tybalt. Then, when Tybalt killed the mercurial Mercutio of Herman Cornejo, Mr. Gomes erupted into a frenzy of murderous rage.</p>
        <p>In the third act he once again made standing still expressive as he defied the impetuosity of Ms. Herrera's Juliet to flee into exile. But, only a few scenes later, the anguished way he lifted and carried her lifeless body about in the tomb revealed that this Romeo was now experiencing total desperation.</p>
        <p>Ermanno Florio conducted the Prokofiev score.</p>
