        <p>The graduation ceremony for Baruch College, held at Madison Square Garden yesterday, was as international as New York City itself.</p>
        <p>Among the nearly 2,000 undergraduates were students who came from as far away as Nepal. The valedictorian was from India. The salutatorian was from France. The honorary degree recipient, Chung Mong Joon, a businessman and political official, was from Korea.</p>
        <p>The diversity of the student body really made a difference in the class's education, the valedictorian, Gursimran Kaur, a 22-year-old from the Punjab region of India, told her classmates. ''Interacting with students from all over the world made us more wise,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Many of the students said they found educational opportunities in New York that were not available in their home countries. Marielle Falki, the salutatorian, a cheerful 30-year-old student who plans to pursue a doctorate in psychology, told her classmates that in France, her native country, she would have faced many obstacles as an older student.</p>
        <p>The commencement speaker, Harry Belafonte, the singer and human rights activist, said he was warmed to see so many immigrants, so many people of color and so many women.</p>
        <p>''Part of the struggle of my generation was to see to it that this is the reality,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The battle is not over, he told the graduates. With more young black men in prison than in college, affirmative action in jeopardy, and the effects of AIDS in Africa today worse than the plagues of the Middle Ages, he said, ''our world sits in a very troubled place and sits in need of leadership and of healing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Belafonte spoke passionately to a hushed audience, relating his own efforts to use his reputation as a singer ''in the service of the human family,'' a mission he said he inherited from his mother -- ''a social activist'' -- as he grew up in a poor family in New York City. (He said that he had not gotten past the first year at George Washington High School, and that the only college degrees he had were honorary ones.)</p>
        <p>He also paid tribute to a longtime Baruch accounting professor, Abraham J. Briloff, who, he said, served as his friend and financial adviser, beginning in ''the early stages of my career, when I could not afford him.''</p>
        <p>Baruch will give 900 graduate degrees today in a ceremony at Avery Fisher Hall. It will award honorary degrees to Irwin Engelman, a 1955 graduate and former vice chairman of Revlon Inc., and to Michael Bloomberg, founder of the financial information company bearing his name, who will also speak.</p>
        <p>Brooklyn College</p>
        <p>Wearing saris, yarmulkes, Muslim head scarves and Easter-type pastel hats, relatives gathered yesterday at Brooklyn College to honor graduates who came from a dozen or more nations. But as one graduate, Sophia Jan, noted, higher education was not always this diverse.</p>
        <p>''Just a moment ago in history I would not have qualified'' to go to college, she said in brief remarks to the graduating class, ''because I am a woman, because I am an Asian, though also American, because I do not belong to the dominant religion. How many others of you would have been excluded?''</p>
        <p>As interpreters signed for the hearing impaired and cameras simulcast the event on the college's Web site, the 75-year-old college bid farewell to 2,600 bachelor's and advanced degree recipients while welcoming its eighth president, Christoph M. Kimmich.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kimmich noted that while students once graduated into ''a narrow world of extraordinary privilege,''  today's graduates, ''will compete not with privilege but rather with others like yourselves, a large and ambitious young work force of both sexes and many colors.''</p>
        <p>Honorary degrees were conferred upon A. M. Rosenthal, Pulitzer Prize journalist long with The New York Times and now a columnist for The Daily News, and Constance Emmer Lieber, a philanthropist and advocate of mental health research.</p>
        <p>As the ceremony closed, Fern Cardali's 4-year-old daughter, Dana, waved shyly at her mother, who had just received her master's degree in education. ''She sat through many classes with me,'' Ms. Cardali said. ''She wouldn't go to bed till I went to bed.'' Walking over to drape her gown over her smiling daughter's shoulders, she explained that Dawn would graduate from nursery school next Thursday.</p>
        <p>One degree recipient, Herbert J. Adlerberg, was completing some unfinished business. He enrolled in Brooklyn College in 1948, but dropped out after three years. He eventually earned a law degree and became a State Supreme Court justice, but never received his bachelor's degree. ''In those days, you were permitted to go to law school without graduating'' from college, he explained. Last year, a friend contacted the college ''and they made me a graduate,'' said Mr. Adlerberg, 70.</p>
        <p>His presence among the undergraduates raised some eyebrows. He  ran into a prosecutor whose son was graduating, who ''almost fell out of his chair when he saw me,'' Mr. Adlerberg said.</p>
        <p>Lehman College</p>
        <p>Lehman College gave out more than 1,800 degrees -- 1,331 undergraduate degrees and 526 graduate degrees -- yesterday morning at its Bronx campus, as well as bestowing honorary doctoral degrees on Ruben Blades, the Panamanian musician, actor and civil rights activist, and Serafin U. Mariel, founder, president and chief executive of the New York National Bank.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blades, who delivered the commencement address, told the graduates that education had helped him achieve his goals. ''Everything I have ever tried was crowned by success because of my education,'' Mr. Blades said, adding that he was the first in his family to earn a college degree.</p>
        <p>Yesenia Flores, a graduate from East New York, Brooklyn, who had thought about becoming a doctor but switched to teaching after working as a tutor during college, urged her classmates to reach out to others as their teachers had reached out to them.</p>
