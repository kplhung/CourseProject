        <p>A few weeks ago, Abrehet Amdimeskel was simply a student, who happened to be in English class when the war with Ethiopia came to her town in southern Eritrea. Now, at 14, she is the head of her uprooted household, caring for her grandmother and four younger siblings in a small tent in a huge refugee camp.</p>
        <p>As towns like hers emptied out, she lost track of her parents and two other siblings, and can only hope that they found their way to some other camp.</p>
        <p>''We want peace,'' she said in a camp of about 37,000 refugees in the town of Dadu, 30 miles northwest of the capital, Asmara. ''We want this to stop. We don't know anything about this war.'' She started to cry but would not let herself.</p>
        <p>In the last few days Ethiopia and Eritrea seem to have finally made progress toward ending their two-year war. But relief officials say it is far from certain that the hundreds of thousands of people displaced in the last three weeks of intense fighting will go home anytime soon. Ethiopia today declared the war over, but there is no cease-fire yet and many people, relief officials say, will simply be too afraid to return.</p>
        <p>Complicating the problem is the worry that this refugee crisis could make the food shortages in Eritrea, which are already bad, far worse. Most of the refugees are from the  Gash Barka region, which produces two-thirds of the nation's grain, according to the United Nations World Food Program.</p>
        <p>The seasonal rains -- and thus the main planting season -- are expected to start in the next two weeks. If the displaced cannot get home to plant, said Bruce Orina, a spokesman here for the International Committee of the Red Cross, ''We are talking about potentially a grim situation as food security is concerned.''</p>
        <p>Already, war and drought have reduced the Gash Barka region's harvest by 90 percent, the World Food Program estimates, and 770,000 people faced food shortages even before this latest round of fighting.</p>
        <p>''There is no other area in Eritrea that can fill that gap,'' said Lindsey Davies, a spokeswoman for the agency here in Asmara.</p>
        <p>Last week, the United Nations began airlifting tons of food for the short-term, and other relief groups are scrambling to provide essentials like blankets, tents, cooking pots and clean water. All are in short supply, relief officials say, though it is possible the needs will evaporate if peace talks in Algeria produce a final cease-fire and everyone goes home.</p>
        <p>What has become clearer in the last few days, though, is just how many people were uprooted from their homes after Ethiopia launched a major offensive on May 12, pushing through the trenches along the nations' disputed border and into the places where people actually live.</p>
        <p>Over the last week, thousands of Eritreans have been moving along the roads, particularly along the border areas south of Asmara, flowing north to escape fierce fighting with almost nothing in their hands.</p>
        <p>''The enemy was shelling with heavy artillery,'' said Negisti Tesfu, 35, a mother of six children who fled from her home near Adi Quala five days before to a camp in Dbarwa, about 12 miles south of Asmara. ''There were air bombardments. So I was forced to leave.'' She said at least one child was killed, a 5-year-old boy, along with six cows and two donkeys. She said her home was demolished.</p>
        <p>Early on, the Eritrean government estimated that about 550,000 people were displaced -- a number that Ethiopia said was propaganda aimed at building sympathy abroad. That would have meant more than 1 in 10 people were displaced in a nation of 3.5 million.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Davies of the World Food Program said that her agency now believed that the estimate is probably correct, based on checking the population figures and a rough count of a dozen or so informal encampments stretching from the Sudanese border east to the city of Keren.</p>
        <p>''We're saying it's plausible but it could go up or down'' depending on the fighting, she said. ''We have to constantly assess and verify the numbers.''</p>
        <p>The numbers include an unknown number of the 330,000 Eritreans already displaced by the war in the last two years.</p>
        <p>Relief officials say the suffering has also been lessened by the extraordinary organization of the Eritrean government in getting people out of the war zones quickly. Tens of thousands of people were moved by government bus and truck into camps. Entire villages have been relocated into the camps, complete with the same local administrators and sometimes the same shops.</p>
        <p>But life is still very hard. Thousands of people who settled along the Gash River in the west have to contend with infestations of scorpions and snakes. Hospitals in the evacuated regions are closed, so there is a shortage of medical care. Relief officials worry that if people do not leave before the rains, the camps will be flooded and it will difficult to get in supplies over muddy and waterlogged roads.</p>
        <p>''Of course I would like to live in my house,'' said Habte Tefere, 80, from a village that was shelled near Adi Quala. ''But I couldn't. So I had to come here.''</p>
