        <p>The framed schedule is affixed to a wall beside Tino Martinez's locker, but he never needed to peek at it as he spoke about the challenging teams the Yankees play over the next three and a half weeks. There was a serious tone to Martinez's voice as he discussed a stretch of 23 games that starts against the Braves in Atlanta tonight because he feels the Yankees have been lethargic.</p>
        <p>Forget about the appeal of a World Series rematch with the Braves or the two best teams from the 1990's continuing their battle in a new decade or the team with the best record in baseball now playing the defending champions.</p>
        <p>Martinez has pushed those story lines aside to concentrate on the importance of today.</p>
        <p>To Martinez, this sexy series against the Braves is critical because the Yankees are playing a terrific team and they should use this three-game series to jolt them and remind them that they must start playing crisper ball.</p>
        <p>To Martinez, the games with the Braves are more about getting the Yankees rolling on a solid streak then they are about rekindling an October rivalry.</p>
        <p>''These games are definitely meaningful, especially in the situation we're in now being behind the Red Sox,'' Martinez said. ''We got to get everybody going. I care about what these games mean for us in our division. We've had a big lead before and played the Braves and it hasn't meant as much if we lost. Now, every game is bigger for us.''</p>
        <p>Martinez was not auditioning to play George Steinbrenner in a movie about the 2000 Yankees. He was simply being honest about a team that has lost four of its last six games, that trailed the first-place Red Sox by one and a half games before last night's Boston-Kansas City game and that is facing seven consecutive series against teams with winning records.</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner declined comment when he was asked, in a telephone interview yesterday, his feeling about how the Yankees have played, not exactly a sign of confidence or patience.</p>
        <p>The Yankees are still pursuing help for their vanishing offense and their most recent discussions centered on Houston's Moises Alou, but they have also discussed Cincinnati's Dmitri Young and Baltimore's B. J. Surhoff.</p>
        <p>Regardless of what the Yankees might do, Martinez, who has struggled with only one homer in his last 73 at-bats, conceded that they must wake up soon.</p>
        <p>''We've got to start playing good ball on a regular basis,'' Martinez said. ''Not one or two games and then a flat game. We need to play with intensity and with life every game. At times, it's been lacking. There are times it seems we turn it up when we need to win. We do that two or three days in a row and then we cruise through a little bit.''</p>
        <p>It is rare for Joe Torre to criticize the Yankees for their effort, but he was obviously exasperated as they went 1 for 11 with runners in scoring position and Ramiro Mendoza walked six in a 7-4 defeat to the A's on Tuesday. Then David Cone pitched so poorly in an 8-7 loss to the A's that he defensively said, ''I'm not done by a long shot.''</p>
        <p>For a team that is 28-21, one game behind last year's pace, the Yankees do not yet have the feel of a cohesive, confident team.</p>
        <p>''I like the team,'' Paul O'Neill said. ''I don't like what I've seen of the team. I don't like the way we're playing. I wouldn't want to go about the season with any other players. I think we all believe we'll get it done somehow, but we haven't played the way that we thought we would.''</p>
        <p>Torre and several players said the Yankees have a tendency to play better against the elite teams so the series against the Braves could be a positive for them. The teams have split 10 interleague games over the last three years.</p>
        <p>While Torre puts more emphasis on the team with the finest record in the major leagues now, which is the Braves, as opposed to the defending champions, Mariano Rivera disagreed.</p>
        <p>When Rivera was asked if he would reflect on the 1999 World Series at Turner Field today, he said: ''We don't have to think about it. They do.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees defeated the Braves for the World Series title in 1996 and 1999, and they could meet again in five months. The Braves are a superior team today, but Torre said the Yankees could summon last season's success to lift them, as long as they do not believe their World Series rings contain magical powers.</p>
        <p>''Wearing the crown is a very delicate thing,'' Torre said. ''You got to make sure you don't decide to think it gets you a free ticket anywhere. It's good for your confidence, but it shouldn't be stuck in anyone's face like we're the world champs so we don't have to work as hard as you.''</p>
        <p>O'Neill peered at the schedule beside Martinez's locker, noticed that the Yankees will play the Braves and Mets three times and the Red Sox seven times this month and said: ''We'd better get ready. We've got a lot of mini-World Series coming up.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>ORLANDO HERNANDEZ will make his first start in 11 days when he faces KEVIN MILLWOOD tonight. ROGER CLEMENS, a five-time Cy Young award winner, opposes GREG MADDUX, a four-time winner, tomorrow. ANDY PETTITTE and TERRY MULHOLLAND are the starters on Sunday.</p>
