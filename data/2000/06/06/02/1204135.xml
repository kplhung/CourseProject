        <p>Wednesday night's 4-3 loss to the Dodgers concluded a grueling nine-game road trip for the Mets in which they went from New York to San Diego to St. Louis to Los Angeles and managed to win five of nine games.</p>
        <p>When it was all over, the player in the worst shape was catcher Mike Piazza, who was removed in the sixth inning of Wednesday night's game after Gary Sheffield's backswing smashed him in the forehead. Piazza suffered a slight concussion and a laceration to his forehead, and the cut required one stitch to close.</p>
        <p>When asked after the game if Piazza would start tonight, Manager Bobby Valentine said: ''I don't know. It's one stitch and the swelling has already gone down quite a bit. It's not out of the question.''</p>
        <p>Jay Horwitz, a Mets spokesman, said yesterday that Piazza was in good shape when the team arrived in the morning after an all-night flight from California and that Piazza would be available to play tonight, when the Mets open a weekend series against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.</p>
        <p>After Wednesday's game, Piazza wore a Band-Aid to cover the bump high on the left side of his forehead. He was not exactly sure how he was hit, but said Sheffield's swing might have dislodged his mask and knocked his helmet into his forehead.</p>
