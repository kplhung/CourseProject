        <p>The latest addition to the wave of rental buildings rising on the west bank of the Hudson River is the Portofino, a 283-unit, 26-story tower in Jersey City.</p>
        <p>The pace of leasing at the building, like its predecessors of the last two years, has been rapid. Half of its studio to three-bedroom units, with 625 to 1,433 square feet, have been leased since they went on the market in April. Rents, which in that time have been raised an average of 6 percent, are $1,800 to $4,600 a month.</p>

        <p>The latest addition to the wave of rental buildings rising on the west bank of the Hudson River is the Portofino, a 283-unit, 26-story tower in Jersey City.</p>
        <p>The pace of leasing at the building, like its predecessors of the last two years, has been rapid. Half of its studio to three-bedroom units, with 625 to 1,433 square feet, have been leased since they went on the market in April. Rents, which in that time have been raised an average of 6 percent, are $1,800 to $4,600 a month.</p>
        <p>As with earlier waterside towers, a  substantial number of the Portofino's apartments, in this case 105, have been rented to tenants from Manhattan, said Marshall B. Tycher, a principal of the Roseland Property Company of Short Hills, N.J.</p>
        <p>Roseland is developing the $53 million project in partnership with Peter Mangin, the president of Garden State Development of Jersey City, and David Seltzer, who heads the Seltzer Group of Manhattan, a real estate development concern. Completion of the building, at the corner of Second Street and Washington Boulevard, is set for July.</p>
        <p>New Jersey's 18-mile Hudson shoreline is increasingly attracting renters from Manhattan, residential brokers said, mainly because of the soaring rents and limited supply of rentals on the other side of the river. Monthly rents for apartments on the New Jersey side, they added, are also 40 to 50 percent cheaper.</p>
        <p>Robert P. Antonicello, president of the ACI Group, a real estate concern in Jersey City, said average rents for riverfront units were $30 a square foot a year, or $2,250 a month for a typical 900-square-foot one-bedroom unit. The rental vacancy rate is under 5 percent despite the 2,300 apartments completed or started along the river's edge in the last two years, he said, noting that 2,500 more units are expected to begin in the next 18 months.</p>
        <p>The new housing along the New Jersey waterfront is especially competitive with the many new rentals in Manhattan being built in neighborhoods that are not traditionally residential, said Nancy Packes, president of Feathered Nest, a brokerage in Manhattan, who is working on a riverfront project in Hoboken, N.J. ''For entry-level tenants who don't have the opportunity to rent in traditional Manhattan neighborhoods on the Upper East or West Sides,'' she said, ''developments across the river in established residential areas, like Hoboken, which are minutes away by PATH, become attractive.''</p>
        <p>Carol M. Smith, director of marketing at Marketing Directors, a Manhattan-based consulting and marketing firm that works with waterside developers in New Jersey, including Roseland, said that office development along the New Jersey side of the Hudson and the migration of Manhattan companies there were helping to spur residential construction.</p>
        <p>The waterfront is now more accessible, she said, pointing to the ferries that ply the river and the 20-mile light-rail line that will link the riverfront towns. The first nine miles of the rail line, from Bayonne to Jersey City, recently opened, and by next year the line is to be extended to Hoboken.</p>
        <p>''Tenants are not fleeing Manhattan,'' Ms. Smith said, ''but more young renters are looking to the waterfront for value.'' She said riverfront apartments in New Jersey were ''10 to 15 percent larger than those in Manhattan.''</p>
        <p>Amenities at the Portofino, designed by the Manhattan firm of Schuman Lichtenstein Claman &amp; Efron, include a fitness room and a high-tech wiring system that provides interactive telephone, video, data and security features. There is also a 283-car garage.</p>
        <p>The Applied Development Company of Hoboken, another waterfront developer, is also providing amenities and services to appeal to Manhattan renters. ''We build to the market, and more of our residents are coming from Manhattan,'' said Michael I. Barry, a senior vice president at the company. For example, he said, at his company's Shipyard project in Hoboken, which eventually will have 1,160 waterside residences, Manhattanites leased 17 percent of the 196 units in the first building. At the second building, they leased 25 percent of the 138 rentals.</p>
        <p>Rents for the studio to three-bedroom units, with 550 to 1,500 square feet, are $1,350 to $3,750 a month.</p>
        <p>At two rental towers, totaling 890 units, that the Lefrak Organization of Rego Park, Queens, completed in the last few years at its Newport mixed-used development in Jersey City, 45 percent of the units were leased to tenants from Manhattan, said Edward Cortese, a spokesman.</p>
        <p>The trend, he added, ''seems to have accelerated'' at the two newest Newport buildings, totaling 850 apartments. Rents for the studio to two-bedroom units, with 650 to 1,200 square feet, at his company's four buildings average $23 a square foot a year, or $1,500 for a 825-square-foot one-bedroom apartment, he said.</p>
        <p>''It's almost a cliche,'' Mr. Cortese said, ''but the reason comes down to location and value.''</p>
