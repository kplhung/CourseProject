        <p>Just hours after Gov. George E. Pataki's emissary came here today urging cooperation among Nassau County leaders as they try to solve the county's fiscal crisis, a new row broke out over a Democratic proposal to lay off a 10th of the county government's nonunion work force.</p>
        <p>The emissary, Frank G. Zarb, whose analysis of Nassau's faltering finances led the governor to propose a $100 million state bailout last month, met with officials here at the Garden City Hotel to urge them to work together quickly to cut county spending.</p>

        <p>Just hours after Gov. George E. Pataki's emissary came here today urging cooperation among Nassau County leaders as they try to solve the county's fiscal crisis, a new row broke out over a Democratic proposal to lay off a 10th of the county government's nonunion work force.</p>
        <p>The emissary, Frank G. Zarb, whose analysis of Nassau's faltering finances led the governor to propose a $100 million state bailout last month, met with officials here at the Garden City Hotel to urge them to work together quickly to cut county spending.</p>
        <p>But all three factions of Nassau's bitterly divided government -- the Democrats who control the County Legislature, the Republican minority and the Republican county executive, Thomas S. Gulotta -- were soon at loggerheads again.</p>
        <p>They fought over the Democrats' plan to cut 56 nonunion positions. The plan called for eliminating jobs ranging from $15,000-a-year part-timers to $90,000-a-year deputy commissioners. Among those targeted were 12 assistant district attorneys, 9 employees of the office of the commissioner of accounts, and 3 of the 7 secretaries assigned to the county executive's office.</p>
        <p>Judith A. Jacobs, the Democratic presiding officer of the Legislature, said: ''Not until we take this step will the public stand for any talk about trimming back on programs we all support. Not until we take this step will the rest of the county's work force be willing to consider any proposals to adjust benefits. And not until we take this step will anyone in this county stand for any talk of raising any kind of taxes.''</p>
        <p>The Democrats found that the county employs 10,594 union workers and 588 nonunion workers. With union workers protected by a no-layoff guarantee this year -- with the exception of the police union, which has been engaged in tumultuous negotiations with the county -- only nonunion employees can be laid off right now. The Democrats said the plan would save $1.47 million this year and $14.4 million by 2004.</p>
        <p>But the plan quickly met with a harsh reception. Mr. Gulotta called it ''a political ploy and charade,'' and questioned the wisdom of many of the layoffs.</p>
        <p>Robert Lazaro, a spokesman for Republicans in the Legislature, called it ''a pathetic publicity stunt,'' noting that only Mr. Gulotta had the power to lay off the workers and chiding the Democrats for making a unilateral announcement instead of working on a measure everyone could support.</p>
        <p>And the Nassau County district attorney, Denis Dillon, released a statement warning that the plan to fire 12 prosecutors ''threatens the safety of the public.''</p>
        <p>The clock, meanwhile, is ticking. The county must act soon to cut $50 million from its 2000 budget, and find $70 million more in recurring cuts for the 2001 budget by the fall. If the county does not show significant improvement by June 30, the credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's has threatened to downgrade its bonds to junk status.</p>
        <p>Adding to the county's uncertain outlook is the scant progress that has been made on Governor Pataki's bailout proposal since May 9, when his announcement of the plan received enthusiastic, bipartisan support.</p>
        <p>That proposal -- which pledges $100 million in state aid to the county in the next five years and calls for the creation of a state board to refinance Nassau's debt, monitor its finances and take control if the county fails to put itself in order -- has stalled as Democrats in Albany seek a greater voice on the board. The proposal requires the approval of both the State and County Legislatures.</p>
        <p>But Assemblyman Thomas P. DiNapoli, the chairman of the county's Democratic Party, said he expected a compromise before the end of the legislative session on June 14.</p>
        <p>''I'm optimistic,'' he said.</p>
