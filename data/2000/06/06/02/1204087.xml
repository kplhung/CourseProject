        <p>The fitfully amusing ''Big Momma's House,'' starring the comic whirligig Martin Lawrence, could best be described as ''Stakeout'' goes ghetto, with a touch of ''Tootsie'' for flava -- er, flavor. Mr. Lawrence  plays Malcolm, an F.B.I. agent with a penchant for doing undercover work in full body makeup, apparently to use some of the disguises he didn't get around to in ''Blue Streak,'' his last ''Where's Martin?'' picture.</p>
        <p>Any fan of Mr. Lawrence's sitcom ''Martin'' knows about his skill in using transformative appliances to convert himself into another person with even fewer inhibitions than he displays as himself. When he threw on padding to play Sheneneh, a homegirl-next-door with press-on nail talons and enough hair extensions to tie a four-mast sailboat to a dock, his immersion into this tough-as-nails character who is all Id was shocking and funny. Here he gets to do the same thing when he goes undercover as Big Momma, a stubborn old Southern woman who throws elbows and knees to the groin like a club fighter.</p>

        <p>The fitfully amusing ''Big Momma's House,'' starring the comic whirligig Martin Lawrence, could best be described as ''Stakeout'' goes ghetto, with a touch of ''Tootsie'' for flava -- er, flavor. Mr. Lawrence  plays Malcolm, an F.B.I. agent with a penchant for doing undercover work in full body makeup, apparently to use some of the disguises he didn't get around to in ''Blue Streak,'' his last ''Where's Martin?'' picture.</p>
        <p>Any fan of Mr. Lawrence's sitcom ''Martin'' knows about his skill in using transformative appliances to convert himself into another person with even fewer inhibitions than he displays as himself. When he threw on padding to play Sheneneh, a homegirl-next-door with press-on nail talons and enough hair extensions to tie a four-mast sailboat to a dock, his immersion into this tough-as-nails character who is all Id was shocking and funny. Here he gets to do the same thing when he goes undercover as Big Momma, a stubborn old Southern woman who throws elbows and knees to the groin like a club fighter.</p>
        <p>Why does he impersonate Big Momma, who has conveniently disappeared from the scene? Big Momma's granddaughter, Sherry (Nia Long), is on the run because her ex-boyfriend, Lester (Terrence Howard), a murderous bank-robber, has escaped from prison and is after her. Desperate, Sherry calls Big Momma to seek refuge and rekindle their cold relationship. Malcolm and his partner (Paul Giamatti) believe they can use Sherry to get to Lester. Since the real Big Momma (Ella Mitchell) is conveniently out of town (and stays away so long you wonder if she is ever coming back), Malcolm seizes the opportunity to take her place. When Mr. Lawrence conceals himself under a cubic ton of Max Factor, you wonder where he hides his ears, which normally stick out like handles on a water pitcher.</p>
        <p>This isn't much of a movie; it looks like a series of baseball card shots and may have the worst rhythms ever in a film directed by a former editor, in this case Raja Gosnell. When ''Momma'' does come to life, it does so because of bits like a small turn by the wide-body jet comedian Cedric ''the Entertainer,'' who plays a raise-the-roof preacher who knows just how to awaken the inner Holy Ghost in his parishioners. In his first appearance, Cedric sports a high-gloss California curl and the camera seems to linger on his coiffed head in disbelief. Later, he has sprouted an Afro with a streak of magenta.</p>
        <p>In his Big Momma cover-up, which must contain enough plastic to wrap an entire herd of beef, Mr. Lawrence brings to mind Foghorn Leghorn in disguise; he's a bigger-than-life cartoon. In taking on some of Big Momma's duties, like midwife -- in a tired childbirth scene, all the onscreen characters say ''Awww'' when the baby arrives, a pander to the audience -- Mr. Lawrence uses his eyes to offer knowing complicity.</p>
        <p>And that's the last thing this movie needs: a wink to let the audience know it's all make-believe. Mr. Lawrence showed more devotion to craft in his television series. And Eddie Murphy, who has done much the same thing in films like ''The Nutty Professor,'' certainly goes deeper into character when he puts on makeup.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lawrence gets laughs when, as Big Momma, he leads the church in a rendition of ''Oh Happy Day'' and jumps into dances like the Robot and the Smurf, but if he hasn't done this stuff before, then it certainly feels as if he has. When he is just talking to Sherry's son, the effect is less worried and naturally funny.</p>
        <p>A restless actor, Mr. Lawrence is better when forced to react to his co-stars, particularly taller ones, as he did with Tim Robbins in ''Nothing to Lose'' or Will Smith in ''Bad Boys.'' In such situations, he can make use of his ability to parody vanity. The able Mr. Giamatti isn't a co-star here, and his exasperation seems to come from the fact that he is relegated to pratfalls. The alluring Ms. Long has shown great progress as an actress this year; her work in the feature ''Boiler Room'' and in a segment of ''If These Walls Could Talk 2'' on HBO shows she is ready for bigger things, so coasting on her beauty here must have been like a paid vacation. Flittering on the periphery is Mr. Howard, who acts as if  he is in a substantial movie, which makes a difference. With his movie-star concentration, in his few scenes he gives ''Big Momma's House'' weight.</p>
        <p>''Big Momma's House'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes loud toilet humor, a childbirth scene and reams of shameless comic violence, innuendo and strong language.</p>
