        <p>Sure, Holly Hunter is a remarkable actor, but who would have guessed she could do a dead-on impersonation of Jimmy Stewart? Well, she can. It comes in a pivotal scene in ''Harlan County War,'' when Ms. Hunter's character, Ruby Kincaid, whose husband and father are striking coal miners, tries to persuade a group of women to join their men on the picket line. She has Stewart nailed, right down to those tongue-tied pauses.</p>
        <p>''I watched scabs take my men's jobs,'' she says. ''They'd ah, dah dah, they've been treating us like this since I's a little girl. Yub yub yub, I'm gettin' sick to death of bein' pushed around.''</p>

        <p>Sure, Holly Hunter is a remarkable actor, but who would have guessed she could do a dead-on impersonation of Jimmy Stewart? Well, she can. It comes in a pivotal scene in ''Harlan County War,'' when Ms. Hunter's character, Ruby Kincaid, whose husband and father are striking coal miners, tries to persuade a group of women to join their men on the picket line. She has Stewart nailed, right down to those tongue-tied pauses.</p>
        <p>''I watched scabs take my men's jobs,'' she says. ''They'd ah, dah dah, they've been treating us like this since I's a little girl. Yub yub yub, I'm gettin' sick to death of bein' pushed around.''</p>
        <p>Yes, Ruby succeeds in convincing the other women. And yes, the downtrodden miners ultimately succeed in their bitter fight with the mine owners. But Ms. Hunter, luminous as she is, cannot succeed in fleshing out this cardboard morality tale.</p>
        <p>The film, which Showtime is offering on Sunday night, is fiction set inside the wrenching 13-month miners' strike in Kentucky that was the subject of the Oscar-winning 1976 documentary ''Harlan County, U.S.A.''</p>
        <p>As soon as you meet Ruby, you know she is one of nature's noblewomen. She lives in a sad little company-owned shack with her working-stiff husband, Silas (Ted Levine); her widowed daddy, Tug Jones (Wayne Robson), a victim of black lung; and two angelic children. She cooks, she sews, she hauls water (no indoor plumbing), and she says,  ''Nothin' ever bothers me.''</p>
        <p>Conditions in the mine are hellish, but when a union organizer, Warren Jakopovich (Stellan Skarsgard) shows up, Ruby isn't impressed. She tells him, ''You cain't ever change the way things is done here.''</p>
        <p>Warren, a former miner born in Poland (as good a cover as any for Mr. Skarsgard's Swedish accent), proves to be noble, too. Under his guidance the miners call a strike, and a long standoff follows.</p>
        <p>Ruby begins to warm to the idea of the union, especially after her daddy gives her one of the film's too many too-pat speeches: ''We been coal miners in this family since way back yonder. Pretty good life. Get a contract, it'll be better.''</p>
        <p>She volunteers her pluck for the cause, becoming Warren's ally and even accompanying him to New York to confront the president of the mine's parent company at a shareholders' meeting, where she delivers another Stewartesque oration. Scenes like this are meant to tug at your heart, as the bluegrass-tinged score makes clear. The banjo signals happy turns; the fiddle, sad ones.</p>
        <p>Despite the best efforts of the other actors, Ms. Hunter may as well be in a one-women show here. There is no sexual tension, or human engagement of any kind, between Warren and Ruby. Her moments with Silas, even an explicit lovemaking scene, have no heat. Their marriage is tested a bit by the strike and Ruby's newfound independence, but matters are neatly resolved.</p>
        <p>Ruby's most fully realized encounter is with the fancy bathtub in her New York hotel room. Her unvarnished wonder at the luxurious plumbing is memorable, but the moment feels like an exercise from acting class.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hunter looks wonderful in her simple cotton dresses, even if her upper arms seem to have been sculptured by lifting weights, not tubs of laundry. But strong as she is, she cannot lift this film, written by Peter Silverman and directed by Tony Bill as more civics lesson than drama. Nor can she breathe life into the down-home dialogue.</p>
        <p>When Ruby tells a slimy mine executive why her husband chose to strike, she says: ''That's why God give us tongues. If it don't taste right, spit it out.''</p>
        <p>Or maybe change the channel.</p>
        <p>SEX AND THE CITY  HBO, Sunday night at 9</p>
        <p>Comb your hair, Junior. Those four randy bachelorettes are back, looking for love in all the wrong places. As ''Sex and the City'' begins its third season, fragile Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) is still trying to get over her breakup with Mr. Big. Uncertain Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) is still on again, off again with dogged Steve (David Eigenberg). Perky Charlotte (Kristin Davis) still can't get her hands on the man of her dreams while insatiable Samantha (Kim Cattrall) can't keep her hands off one nightmare guy after another.</p>
        <p>Sunday's episode opens with the four women standing, ''Titanic'' style, on the prow of a Staten Island ferry. Carrie is on her way to judge a firefighters' beefcake contest and her friends are along to ogle. Samantha finds a fireman to smolder with while Carrie fends off the advances of a politician, Bill Kelly (John Slattery). ''He's way too I'm-the-guy,'' Carrie says. But before long she's thinking about playing I'm-the-girl with him. Bill will be back in the next episode, when Carrie hits the campaign trail and wonders if there can be sex without politics.</p>
        <p>This series earns the adjective adult, both for its frank presentation of its subject matter and its sophisticated look at the childishness of grown-ups. Its four stars continue to work together seamlessly. They keep their characters just this side of caricature and they keep their viewers wondering how a half-hour can zip by so quickly.</p>
        <p>Do women this adorable really travel in hungry packs around New York? Dream on, Junior.</p>
        <p>HARLAN COUNTY WAR  Showtime, Sunday night at 8</p>
        <p>Written by Peter Silverman; directed by Tony Bill. Robert W. Cort, David Madden, Mimi Rogers and Chris Ciaffa, executive producers; Keri Selig, co-producer; Flavio Labiano, director of photography. Music by Van Dyke Parks.</p>
        <p>WITH: Holly Hunter (Ruby Kincaid); Stellan Skarsgard (Warren Jakopovich), Ted Levine (Silas Kincaid), Wayne Robson (Tug Jones), Alex House (Buddy Kincaid), Charlotte Arnold (Lucinda Kincaid), Ker Wells (Little Lee) and Jennifer Irwin (Mary Ball).</p>
