        <p>Auto sales dropped 2 percent last month from May of last year, the first year-to-year drop since the summer of 1998. Dismal results at DaimlerChrysler and General Motors entirely accounted for the decline as other manufacturers posted record sales, leaving it unclear whether a long-expected decline in sales had begun.</p>
        <p>Only one in five buyers of new family vehicles pays cash; the rest rely on loans or leases, for which the monthly payments vary with interest rates. As a result, the auto industry is usually one of the first to feel the effects when the Federal Reserve starts pushing up interest rates, as it has done in recent months. Many economists, including Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, have long watched for weak auto sales as an early indicator that the American economy might be slowing.</p>
        <p>But if auto sales fell because of a slowing economy, many automakers would be expected to post lower sales figures. Instead, Ford Motor, Toyota, Nissan, Honda and Mitsubishi announced increases in sales, with Toyota and Mitsubishi reporting their best months ever. Industry experts suggested this meant that the overall decline in sales in May was linked at least as much to specific problems at DaimlerChrysler and G.M. as to the pace of economic growth in the United States.</p>
        <p>While the 2 percent decline in sales last month was the first since August 1998, when a strike crippled G.M., sales were still very strong last month by historical standards. Ward's Auto Infobank, a market data service in Southfield, Mich., calculated that the seasonally adjusted annual rate of sales last month was 17.1 million vehicles. That put last month's sales above the average pace for last year, the industry's best ever, with 17 million vehicles sold.</p>
        <p>DaimlerChrysler's sales plunged 16.8 percent last month after the company tried to reduce its rebates and other discounts in May. The company announced on Wednesday that it was increasing its rebates and eliminating most low-rate auto loans as part of a new sales-incentive campaign intended to match the more generous discounts offered by its main rivals, G.M. and Ford.</p>
        <p>May of 1999 was also the best month ever for DaimlerChrysler. ''That is a tough benchmark,'' James P. Holden, the president of DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler unit, said in a statement.</p>
        <p>G.M.'s sales fell 5.8 percent, as the company, the world's largest automaker, struggled to stay ahead of Ford in total sales. Paul Ballew, G.M.'s executive director of market analysis, attributed the G.M. drop to shortfalls in three specific segments of the auto market, rather than an overall weakening of the market in response to the Federal Reserve's six increases in short-term interest rates or rising gas prices.</p>
        <p>G.M.'s sales of luxury cars suffered as Cadillac ran short of the new DeVille sedan, for which G.M. is still ramping up production after redesigning the vehicle, Mr. Ballew said. The overall pickup truck market weakened in May, while Korean automakers continued to expand their share of the small-car market, which G.M. once dominated.</p>
        <p>''I don't think you can declare May some watershed of industry moderation'' in the pace of sales, Mr. Ballew said in a telephone conference call with reporters this afternoon, adding that G.M. still expected sales to slow somewhat later this year.</p>
        <p>But Haig Stoddard, the manager of industry analysis at Ward's, was more concerned about the industry's short-term health. ''We're definitely heading at least into a stop in the growth we've had,'' he said. ''But June should be a good month because now we've got all this excess inventory they've got to get rid of.''</p>
        <p>G. Richard Wagoner Jr., G.M.'s president, added the title of chief executive today, replacing John F. Smith Jr., who remains chairman.</p>
        <p>Ford's sales crept up 1.4 percent, which still allowed the company to say that it had just enjoyed its best May ever. Toyota's sales inched up 2.7 percent to break a record set last year. Honda's sales rose 3.6 percent, Nissan's increased 11.5 percent and Mitsubishi's were up 31.3 percent.</p>
        <p>The most recently introduced models sold best, the latest sign that American shoppers are becoming more conscious of the latest styles when it comes to cars. William J. Kirrane, Nissan's vice president and general manager of Nissan brand cars, said that his company's Sentra small car and Xterra sport utility vehicle were the most recently introduced models and had sold especially briskly even without incentives.</p>
        <p>''The new products have really done well for us,'' Mr. Kirrane said.</p>
