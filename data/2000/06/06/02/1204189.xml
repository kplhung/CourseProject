        <p>Parents who shun vaccines, patients who demand antibiotics for every sniffle, farmers who use penicillin to fatten their cows and people who wash with antibacterial soaps are all contributing to the spread of disease and the emergence of dangerous, drug-resistant germs, researchers said today at a press briefing on infectious diseases held by the American Medical Association.</p>
        <p>Worldwide, infectious disease is the leading cause of death. In the United States, it is the third-leading cause, after heart disease and cancer, and deaths from infection increased from 1980 through 1995.</p>

        <p>Parents who shun vaccines, patients who demand antibiotics for every sniffle, farmers who use penicillin to fatten their cows and people who wash with antibacterial soaps are all contributing to the spread of disease and the emergence of dangerous, drug-resistant germs, researchers said today at a press briefing on infectious diseases held by the American Medical Association.</p>
        <p>Worldwide, infectious disease is the leading cause of death. In the United States, it is the third-leading cause, after heart disease and cancer, and deaths from infection increased from 1980 through 1995.</p>
        <p>A speaker at the meeting also warned that the health care system in the United States was not prepared for a bioterrorist attack, in which hundreds or thousands of people might flood hospitals, needing treatment for diseases like anthrax, plague or smallpox, which most doctors in this country have never seen.</p>
        <p>Dr. Bruce G. Gellin, executive director of the National Network for Immunization Information at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, said unfounded theories ostensibly linking vaccines to disorders like diabetes were needlessly alarming parents and making some reluctant to vaccinate their children.</p>
        <p>When a child falls ill after being vaccinated, though it is almost certainly a coincidence, it is human nature for parents to suspect the vaccine, and Dr. Gellin acknowledged that their stories make frightening anecdotes. But he said there was no evidence that any vaccine could cause diabetes. Asked to comment on recent Congressional hearings about the possibility, he said, ''Passion overtook science.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Gellin warned that even a small drop in the vaccination rate could lead to a resurgence of diseases like measles and whooping cough, both of which can be fatal. But young parents today may not take the threat seriously because they themselves were vaccinated and have no memory of how severe those diseases can be. Even chickenpox, which many people consider minor, leads to 15,000 hospitalizations and 100 deaths a year, he said.</p>
        <p>Declines in the vaccination rate have led to measles epidemics this year in the Netherlands, with more than 3,000 cases, and in Dublin, with more than 700. Several deaths have occurred in each country.</p>
        <p>Another speaker, Dr. Stuart Levy, director of the Center for Adaptation Genetics and Drug Resistance at Tufts University in Boston, said antibacterial soaps and sprays, popular for washing hands and spritzing kitchen counters, may actually encourage the growth of ever-hardier, drug-resistant germs.</p>
        <p>Dr. Levy said consumers should buy only products without antibacterials, and manufacturers should leave out the antibacterials and go back to making plain, old-fashioned soap and detergent.</p>
        <p>Dr. Levy said he had made his concerns known to manufacturers. Some seemed to take him seriously, he said, but others, he suspected, ''wish people like me would just go away.''</p>
        <p>He said the problem with antibacterials was a simple matter of ''survival of the fittest.'' Rather than killing all bacteria, the products destroy only the weakest, leaving stronger ones to survive and multiply.</p>
        <p>If people acted like surgeons and scrubbed for 10 minutes or left the spray on their kitchen counters for a half hour, the chemicals might actually kill more germs, he said. But nobody does that.</p>
        <p>His research has shown that bacteria resistant to antibacterials are also resistant to some antibiotics used to treat infections in people, and so, he said, widespread use of the products may be contributing to the rise in infections that are difficult or impossible to treat.</p>
        <p>Overuse of antibiotics is also a factor in the development of resistance, Dr. Levy said, citing patients who pressure doctors for unnecessary antibiotics and farmers who use the drugs as pesticides on fruit trees and growth promoters in livestock.</p>
        <p>Dr. James Hughes, director of the National Center for Infectious Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, attributed the rise in death rates from infectious disease partly to lax monitoring, because of the mistaken belief that such diseases had been largely wiped out in the United States.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hughes also warned that the world had become a global village, and that the United States must pay more attention to diseases elsewhere and ''expect the unexpected,'' meaning outbreaks of illnesses that have not occurred here. The outbreak of West Nile encephalitis in the New York area last year was an example, he said, noting that the disease had previously been reported only in Europe, western Asia and Africa.</p>
        <p>Dr. Michael Osterholm, chairman of a private company, Infection Control Advisory Network, in Eden Prairie, Minn., said terrorists could easily obtain infectious organisms and the means to grow and disseminate them. For example, Dr. Osterholm said, crop-dusting airplanes can be bought over the Internet.</p>
        <p>Dr. Osterholm predicted that some sort of germ attack was bound to occur, but, he said, the United States was not prepared. He said stockpiles of drugs and vaccines were needed, along with plans and systems for quickly diagnosing diseases and treating huge numbers of victims.</p>
