        <p>Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy opera, classical music and dance events this weekend in the Northeast.</p>
        <p>Opera</p>
        <p>''MARRIAGE OF FIGARO.'' The homespun but attractive qualities of the Amato Opera's productions and the intimacy of its shoe-box theater offer a useful change of perspective for operagoers used to the big houses uptown. The casts here vary: at the very least, the singers are eager and enthusiastic; sometimes the singing shows great promise. And Anthony Amato, the company's founder, conducts the performances with an evident love of the music. The closing production of the company's season is Mozart's ''Marriage of Figaro,'' performed in English. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday at 2:30 p.m.,  Amato Opera Theater, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village; (212) 228-8200. Tickets: $25; $20 for the elderly and children (Allan Kozinn).</p>

        <p>Classical Music</p>
        <p>AMERICAN BOYCHOIR. This chorus did excellent work in Bach's St. John Passion in April with Kurt Masur and the New York Philharmonic. Here, conducted by its music director, James Litton, and with the New York Collegium playing period instruments, it performs works by Franz Joseph Haydn's younger brother, Michael, a fascinating composer in his own right. The pieces, Missa ''St. Leopoldi'' and ''Vesperae pro festo sanctissimae innocentium,'' will later be recorded by Linn Records for release in the fall. Sunday at 7 p.m., Richardson Auditorium, Princeton University, Princeton, N.J., (609) 258-5000. Tickets: $15 to $25; $10 for students (James R. Oestreich).</p>
        <p>BACHANALIA CHAMBER ORCHESTRA. The group concludes its season, devoted mostly to 20th-century music, with a wide-ranging program. Nina Beilina, a violinist and the artistic director, is the soloist in two preludes and fugues from Bach's ''Well-Tempered Clavier,'' arranged for string orchestra by Philip Lasser. Villa-Lobos's ''Bachiana Brasileira'' No. 9 is presented alongside real Bach, an aria from the ''St. Matthew Passion.'' The orchestra also plays Schoenberg's ''Verklarte Nacht'' and, in its premiere, Jacob Jakoulov's ''Romance.'' Tonight at 8, St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue at 54th Street, (203) 938-2924. Tickets: $20; $10 for students and the elderly (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>GARLAND FOR LINDA. After Linda McCartney died of breast cancer in 1998, Sir Paul McCartney commissioned a group of composers to write a series of choral works that would commemorate his wife and help raise money for the Garland Appeal, which supports breast cancer research and other causes. Among those who responded were Sir John Tavener, Roxana Panufnik, Judith Bingham, John Rutter, David Matthews, Michael Berkeley, Giles Swayne and Sir Richard Rodney Bennett. Sir Paul, who has been writing classical music lately, also supplied a work for the collection, which is called ''A Garland for Linda.'' EMI recently released a recording of the set, which is to be performed in concert (along with choral arrangements of a few Beatles songs) tomorrow at 7:45 p.m. at Riverside Church, Riverside Drive at 122nd Street, Morningside Heights; (212) 307-4100 or (800) 755-4000. Tickets: $30 to $250 (Kozinn).</p>
        <p>GOLDEN FLEECE. The company presents new music-theater pieces. ''Owl in Love,'' by the Philharmonic bassist and humorist Jon Deak, is based on a Haitian folk tale. ''Happy Valentine'' is a love triangle, with lyrics by William Cotter and music by Lou Rodgers. Scenes from Matthew Harris's ''Tess,'' after the Thomas Hardy novel, complete the program. Today, tomorrow and Monday at 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 and 8 p.m.; Theater 22, 54 West 22nd Street, Chelsea; (212) 691-6105. Tickets: $15, students and seniors $12 (Paul Griffiths).</p>
        <p>HUDSON VALLEY CHAMBER MUSIC CIRCLE. Joseph Kalichstein, Jaime Laredo and Sharon Robinson, pianist, violinist and cellist, are familiar to New Yorkers from their fine series of concerts each season at the 92nd Street Y. Here they take the show up the river. The program sets classics -- Beethoven's B flat Trio (Op. 11) and Brahms's wonderfully expansive B major Trio (Op. 8) -- against Richard Danielpour's ''Child's Reliquary,'' which these players recently gave its premiere. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Olin Hall, Bard College, Route 9G, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y.; (914) 338-1172. Tickets: $20; $15 for the elderly; $5 for students (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>MANHATTAN CHAMBER CHOIR AND ORCHESTRA OF SACRED MUSIC. The conductor, choir director, organist and pianist Robert Prior founded the Manhattan Chamber Choir and Orchestra of Sacred Music last year to perform music from various eras of Roman Catholic tradition. Two works on its program tonight, the final concert of the ensemble's season, can be said to emanate from  that tradition: Liszt's Missa Choralis for chorus and orchestra, and Britten's ''Rejoice in the Lamb,'' a cantata for chorus and organ. But claiming the work that concludes the program, Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 9 in E flat,  as part of the Catholic tradition is a stretch. Still, it's a great piece and fits nicely into the program for this free concert. Mr. Prior, who will conduct, is also the pianist for the concerto. Church of the Holy Innocents, 128 West 37th Street, Manhattan. Tonight at 7:30. Admission is free. Information: (718) -224-5721 (Anthony Tommasini).</p>
        <p>MUSIC BEFORE 1800. This group belies its title by going to Brooklyn on Sunday afternoon and presenting sacred music written after 1977. The pieces, all American, are by Catherine Aks, Harvey Burgett, Jackson Hill, David MacBride, Louise Talma and Maurice Wright. Louise Basbas is the group's music director. At Christ Church and Holy Family, 326 Clinton Street, Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets, $15; $10 for students and the elderly; (212) 666-9266. (Bernard Holland).</p>
        <p>NEW CHAMBER MUSIC. The musicians are Robert Frankenberry (piano), Roger Zahab (violin) and David Russell (cello). Mr. Zahab is also one of the composers, in company with Elliott Carter (''Figment'' for solo cello), Judith Weir (Piano Trio), Tamar Diesendruck, Harold Meltzer, C. Bryan Rulon and Dennis Riley. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., St. Peter's Episcopal Church, 346 West 20th Street, Chelsea; (212) 741-0011. Tickets: $10; students and the elderly, $8 (Griffiths).</p>
        <p>NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC. Like many other German conductors, Kurt Masur spent formative years of his youth without the music of Mahler, which was banned under the Nazis' anti-Semitic policies. But he has warmed to a few of the symphonies. He conducted the Philharmonic in the First recently at Carnegie Hall, and here, to end the orchestra's season, he leads the valedictory Ninth, which he and the Philharmonic recorded six years ago for Teldec. With an end to Mr. Masur's eventful tenure as music director now in sight, though still two seasons away, performances of monumental works like this take on added significance. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center; (212) 875-5030 or (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $18 to $77; the performances are sold out, but returns may be available (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>BERNADETTE SPEACH AND THULANI DAVIS. The pianist and composer Bernadette Speach and the poet Thulani Davis have been collaborating on new works in recent years. They are presenting some of their most recent pieces, including ''Passages and Outtakes'' and ''Woman Without Adornment,'' with Ms. Davis reciting the texts, Ms. Speach at the piano, Alva Rogers as vocalist and Jeffrey Schanzer on guitar. Tomorrow at 8 p.m. Lafayette Avenue Presbyterian Church, Lafayette Avenue and South Oxford Street, Fort Greene, Brooklyn; (718) 972-3085. Tickets: $7. (Kozinn)</p>
        <p>WILD GINGER PHILHARMONIC. This colorfully named ensemble of young, energetic players has developed an enthusiastic following since it was founded by David Goodman in 1995. The Brahms Third Symphony is the centerpiece of its program this time. Included as well are Wagner's ''Tannhauser'' Overture and Humperdinck's Overture to ''Hansel and Gretel.'' Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Good Shepherd-Faith Presbyterian Church, 152 West 66th Street, Manhattan; (212) 879-1363. Tickets: suggested donation is $20, $10 for students and the elderly (Kozinn).</p>
        <p>Dance</p>
        <p>AMERICAN BALLET THEATER. Like the film fare at Saturday children's matinees -- do they still exist? -- ''Le Corsaire'' teems with swashbuckling pirates, pretty slave women and skulking villains. Buried in its endearingly old-fashioned melodrama are gems of classical ballet and opportunities for fireworks, like the ''Corsaire'' pas de deux. Today at 8 p.m.; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $20 to $75. Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center; (212) 362-6000 (Jennifer Dunning).</p>
        <p>H. T. CHEN AND DANCERS. The interweaving of generations and cultures in Asian-American families is celebrated in ''Bian Dan.'' The choreography makes expressive use of bamboo shoulder poles used throughout Asia to carry loads, and in various scenes they come to symbolize burdens, oracle sticks and building materials. Today and tomorrow at 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3:30 and 8 p.m., La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, East Village; (212) 475-7710. Tickets: $20 tonight and tomorrow; $15 Sunday (Jack Anderson).</p>

Tonight through Sunday night at 8:30. Tickets: $12. Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village; (212) 674-8194 Also at Danspace this weekend will be dance by Joyce S. Lim and Nami Yamamoto exploring the subtleties of intertwined Asian cultures as part of the theater's free informal Draftwork series, an informal showcase for works in progress.

''Beethoven -- Not Four Naught'' resembles a dialogue between dancers and a Beethoven quartet; ''Spores, Solitude and Summer Humming'' is inspired by patterns of spore reproduction; ''aSOlo'' is a stream-of-consciousness blending of movements and words.

        <p>NEW YORK CITY BALLET. For all his reputation as the master of non-narrative ballet, George Balanchine knew how to tell a good story in dance. He and Alexandra Danilova came up with a confectionary delight in their staging of ''Coppelia,'' a lighthearted romp with dark undertones featuring a village lass, her homespun fiance and a mad old toymaker.

Jeffrey, Elisa King and James Sutton and in ''Raymonda Variations,'' staged by Brunilda Ruiz and Paul Sutherland. Tomorrow at 7:30 p.m.; Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $6 (no reservations).
