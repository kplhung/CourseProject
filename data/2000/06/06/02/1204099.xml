        <p>Even as Sunday's Tony Awards signal the end of one season, another slate of shows is wheeling into sight, whether you're ready or not.</p>
        <p>First comes news of the return of a celebrated one-woman play whose star has been absent from the Broadway stage for nearly 15 years.</p>
        <p>It is Jane Wagner's ''Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe,'' a panoramic look at a group of radicals, corporate tools and homeless visionaries, all inhabiting the body and mind of Lily Tomlin.</p>
        <p>The show was a critical and popular hit in 1985 and subsequently toured extensively. Ms. Tomlin won a Tony for her performance and soon became a film star.</p>
        <p>Now she is returning to Broadway, having dusted off the piece last summer during a long American tour. ''Search'' is to open on Nov. 16 after playing at the Seattle Repertory Theater and the McCarter Theater in Princeton, N.J. The plan is for a 10-week run at a Shubert theater, possibly the Booth.</p>
        <p>Ms. Tomlin said the impetus came after she and Ms. Wagner showed a short portion of ''Search'' to students in a workshop at the University of Southern California. ''The kids had never seen it,'' Ms. Tomlin said in a telephone interview from Los Angeles. ''And they just responded.''</p>
        <p>The opening date, however, may sound awfully familiar to the producers of ''Little Women,'' the musical adaptation of the Louisa May Alcott novel. The piece, being produced by Randall L. Wreghitt (''The Beauty Queen of Leenane'') and Dani Davis, had a reading in April. That was followed in short order by the dismissal of the original songwriting team.</p>
        <p>In their place are Mindi Dickstein, a lyricist whose most recent stage credits include versions of ''Black Beauty'' and ''Little Red Riding Hood,'' and the composer Jason Howland, a protege of Frank Wildhorn. Mr. Howland had been a producer on it. That hiccup aside, ''Little Women'' still plans a late September opening in Boston but will probably shift its Broadway opening at the Ambassador to Nov. 15 to avoid conflict with ''Search.''</p>
        <p>Return of Vidal</p>
        <p>It's been more than two months since producers began to talk about a revival of ''The Best Man,'' Gore Vidal's 1960 satire set in the hothouse environs of a presidential campaign. But now the project appears to be moving ahead with a surprising cast.</p>
        <p>No contracts have been signed, but Jeffrey Richards, one of its producers, says that Spalding Gray, the acclaimed monologuist, has agreed to appear, alongside Charles Durning and Elizabeth Ashley. Mr. Gray would play William Russell, an upstanding presidential candidate with a secret or three, while Mr. Durning would be the ailing President Hockstader. Ms. Ashley would play Mrs. Gammage, the coy national committee chairwoman.</p>
        <p>An agent privy to the negotiations said that Kyle MacLachlan had also been approached, but Mr. Richards would not confirm that. Ethan McSweeney (''Never the Sinner'') will direct.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vidal, never shy to opine, said he was extremely pleased with the casting if not with the process.</p>
        <p>''It was no problem casting 40 years ago unless you wanted Marilyn Monroe,'' he said by telephone from Ravello, Italy, where he lives. ''Today, the actors might still be available, but these agents in Hollywood would rather have their client play a small role in a western to be shot on speculation in Tucson rather than put him in 'Hamlet' on Broadway.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Vidal plans to come to the States to see his opening. The show is to begin previews on Broadway on Sept. 5 and run through Dec. 31. The timing is felicitous for Mr. Vidal; his latest history, ''The Golden Age,'' about World War II, is to be published by Doubleday in September. And on Oct. 4 he turns 75.</p>
        <p>How does he feel his examination of 1950's politics fares in the current political climate?</p>
        <p>''The first thing that you or anyone would notice is there's no mention of money,'' Mr. Vidal said. ''No hard money or soft money. Nobody talks about it.''</p>
        <p>He doesn't plan to update it to fit today's cash-dominated scene. ''The audience is going to be transported to the days of Dick Nixon and Jack Kennedy,'' he said. ''You're going to see what we took for granted.''</p>
        <p>Eviction of a Legend</p>
        <p>Think of Stella Adler, and one almost instantly imagines the fervent early years of American theater, when Stanislavsky was king, matinee tickets were $1 and theaters were grand. But now the acting school that bears that legendary actress's name is in danger of becoming homeless.</p>
        <p>The Stella Adler Conservatory, which Adler founded in 1949 and taught at until her death in 1992, has been at 419 Lafayette Street in the East Village for a decade, just down the block from the Public Theater. But this year the conservatory was told it would be evicted when its lease expires next summer.</p>
        <p>While that is over a year away, the school needs to raise $1.5 million to guarantee a new home. Tom Oppenheim, the conservatory's artistic director and Adler's grandson, said that the inflated real estate market would make it hard to find enough space at the right price.</p>
        <p>''I looked at a space at 26th Street and 11th Avenue last year, which was $15 per square foot,'' Mr. Oppenheim said. ''Now it's $40 per square foot.''</p>
        <p>To raise the money, Mr. Oppenheim has turned to foundations and past students. The school lists luminaries like Marlon Brando, Warren Beatty and Harvey Keitel as alumni.</p>
        <p>''If there is a positive aspect to all of this,'' Mr. Oppenheim said, ''it's that it connects us to alumni and the theater community.''</p>
        <p>Along the Way</p>
        <p>*Tony Torn, son of Rip Torn and Geraldine Page, will be in a new translation of Eugene Ionesco's ''Picture'' starting Monday at the Chashama Theater, 135 West 42nd Street. Dad is the producer.</p>
        <p>*Victoria LaBalme, a student of Marcel Marceau and a wicked mime herself, will appear at 8 p.m. Sunday only at P.S. 122, 150 First Avenue in the East Village.</p>
        <p>* Dana Delany will take over for Lisa Emery in the role of Karen, the opinionated wife, in the Pulitzer Prize-winning ''Dinner With Friends'' at the Variety Arts Theater on June 13.</p>
