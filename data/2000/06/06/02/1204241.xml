        <p>Re ''Central Park Keepers Struggling to Balance Masses With Grasses'' (front page, May 29): Years ago, there was loud, pulsating music at Bethesda Fountain on any given weekend.

        <p>Today, many of the musicians are there to make a buck. They know that tourists frequent the spot, and the musicians wait for the bucket to go around when the music stops. The park must accommodate all tastes and styles, and lovers of both noise and peace must allow for concession and compromise.</p>
