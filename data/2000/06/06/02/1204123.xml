        <p>THE market for million-dollar homes in Florida and Texas has long been stimulated by the fact that such houses appeal to one particular class of wealthy people -- those who are about to file for bankruptcy. Now Congress is about to increase the appeal of such homes to rich people who may not face imminent bankruptcy, but see it as a possibility if they lose a big lawsuit.</p>
        <p>The unlimited homestead exemption in those two states -- as well as in South Dakota, Iowa and Kansas, although relocating deadbeats tend to prefer Boca Raton winters to those of Sioux Falls -- has long been the most obvious way that people with a lot of assets can abuse the bankruptcy code. Go broke owning a $10 million mortgage-free house in Houston, and you can stiff your creditors while you keep the house. Once you emerge from bankruptcy, you can sell the house and use the cash to maintain the lifestyle you think you deserve. So high-livers tend to move from New York, where the homestead exemption is $10,000, to Florida or Texas before they file for bankruptcy.</p>

        <p>THE market for million-dollar homes in Florida and Texas has long been stimulated by the fact that such houses appeal to one particular class of wealthy people -- those who are about to file for bankruptcy. Now Congress is about to increase the appeal of such homes to rich people who may not face imminent bankruptcy, but see it as a possibility if they lose a big lawsuit.</p>
        <p>The unlimited homestead exemption in those two states -- as well as in South Dakota, Iowa and Kansas, although relocating deadbeats tend to prefer Boca Raton winters to those of Sioux Falls -- has long been the most obvious way that people with a lot of assets can abuse the bankruptcy code. Go broke owning a $10 million mortgage-free house in Houston, and you can stiff your creditors while you keep the house. Once you emerge from bankruptcy, you can sell the house and use the cash to maintain the lifestyle you think you deserve. So high-livers tend to move from New York, where the homestead exemption is $10,000, to Florida or Texas before they file for bankruptcy.</p>
        <p>The bankruptcy bill passed by the House did nothing to deal with that abuse, but after a bruising floor fight, the Senate voted to cap the homestead exemption at $100,000.</p>
        <p>Now, meeting behind closed doors, a compromise has been reached, and the senators fighting that abuse have tentatively signed off on it. It will be pitched as a meaningful reform, one that will reduce the abuse. But the reduction is likely to be minimal.</p>
        <p>Under the proposal, the unlimited Florida and Texas exemptions will be available only to those who have lived in the states for at least two years before they file for bankruptcy. And even for them, the exemption will be limited to the amount of equity that the person had in the home two years before filing, plus $100,000. Somebody who moves to Florida just before filing will be out of luck. If fraud can be proved, something that is never easy, money put into a house up to seven years before filing may be vulnerable.</p>
        <p>The catch is that many once-rich people can plan for going broke, stalling off creditors and appealing judgments while the two-year clock is ticking. ''It just says, be sure not to wait too long to get your house in Texas or Florida,'' says Elizabeth Warren, a Harvard law professor.</p>
        <p>The bill also will put a limit of $1 million on the amount a person can squirrel away in an individual retirement account immune from creditors. But it won't do anything about a myriad of other ways, often involving trusts, that money can be protected from creditors. Congress decided not to put a cap on such maneuvers.</p>
        <p>Even though the once-wealthy who take the trouble to plan will still be able to hold on to assets while creditors suffer, the bill that emerges from Congress is sure to make life harder on most of those who file for bankruptcy -- usually after a divorce, job loss or severe illness. The credit card companies will collect more of what they are owed.</p>
        <p>The supposed urgency of bankruptcy legislation came from a rapid rise in the number of bankruptcy filings. That surge has ended, and the number of new cases is falling. But this is a bill with momentum, and final passage is likely if a few disputes -- including one related to judgments against abortion protesters -- can be settled. The new law will do a lot to cut out abuses by people who were just scraping by before they went broke, but much less to eliminate abuses by people who were rich before a judge ordered them to repay people they had defrauded.</p>
        <p>They will call that reform.</p>
