        <p>Lawyers for a group of black agents who have filed a racial discrimination lawsuit against the Secret Service asked a federal judge today to stop what they said were efforts by the agency to intimidate their clients.</p>
        <p>The lawyers said the retaliation had taken several forms, including forced transfers to jobs with less responsibility and warnings by senior official to some of the black agents that their careers could be in jeopardy as a result of the class-action lawsuit.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the agency, James Mackin, denied the accusations, saying: ''We have not in any way engaged in any retaliatory actions or practices and would never do so. We have a zero tolerance policy for discrimination of any kind.''</p>
        <p>The accusations of retaliation underscored the heightened tension at the Secret Service since May 3, when the black agents filed a lawsuit on a broad array of personnel policies.</p>
        <p>The conflict comes at a particularly significant time for the Secret Service, with the presidential election in November opening a number of leadership jobs.</p>
        <p>The agency, which is well known for its high-profile duties protecting the president and other dignitaries, is one whose internal operations are largely hidden by a secretive culture.</p>
        <p>Several agents said they had been subjected to direct and veiled threats because they agreed to be identified as plaintiffs in the suit.</p>
        <p>Leroy Hendrix, a plaintiff who is on Vice President Al Gore's security detail, said he was denied a promotion after complaining that a superior told him of a racial quota system. Later, Mr. Hendrix was transferred to what the lawyers said was a less desirable job.</p>
        <p>Another agent, Luther K. Ivery, said his superiors warned him that they were displeased that he had joined the suit. In a legal brief filed today, Mr. Ivery quoted his supervisor as telling him, ''If I were you, I wouldn't be the one up front.''</p>
        <p>The lawyers said the director of the Secret Service, Brian Stafford, and another high-ranking official had written e-mail messages warning them against participating in the lawsuit.</p>
        <p>An electronic message on Feb. 25 to all employees that was attributed to Mr. Stafford said that ''it is offensive for anyone to question our commitment to equal employment opportunities for all our employees,'' which the lawyers said was intended to question the validity of the lawsuit.</p>
        <p>No one at the agency would comment on the record about the lawyers' accusation, but other Secret Service officials said the message, distributed more than a month before the discrimination complaint was filed, was meant only as a restatement of the agency's official policies against racial discrimination and was not intended to pass judgment on the suit.</p>
        <p>The lawyers also asked a judge to halt job performance evaluations that are scheduled to begin this month. The evaluations are used to determine which agents will receive promotions.</p>
