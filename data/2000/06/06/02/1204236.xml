        <p>A Long Island schoolteacher on a hiking field trip fell into a stream and died at an environmental center in the Catskills yesterday, as eight special-education students looked on, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>The teacher, Laura Steckler, 30, was hiking a trail at the Frost Valley Y.M.C.A. Environmental Education Center in Claryville, Ulster County, around 3 p.m., when she slipped on some rocks and slid down a 25-foot embankment into the fast-moving stream, the Ulster County Sheriff's Office said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Steckler, a teacher at Rosemary Kennedy Center, a state-run school in Plainview, Long Island, for children with physical and mental disabilities, was pulled out of the water unconscious and could not be revived, the police said. Whether she drowned or died from hitting the rocks has not yet been determined.</p>
        <p>Frost Valley, a 6,000-acre retreat set partly inside the Catskill Forest Preserve, is one of the largest environmental education centers in the country, said the organization's executive director, Halbe Brown. He said the death was the first in the center's 35-year history.</p>
        <p>He said Ms. Steckler had put on insect repellent and had gone to the stream's edge to rinse her hands  when she slipped on moss on rocks.</p>
