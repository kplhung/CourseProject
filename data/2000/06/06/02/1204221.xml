        <p>An ambitious plan to create a post to oversee the government's spy-catching efforts has been shelved by the Clinton administration, largely because of strong opposition from Attorney General Janet Reno, federal officials said today.</p>
        <p>The job of a national counterintelligence executive was proposed to answer widespread criticism of the government's efforts to combat espionage.</p>
        <p>The official would have been asked to develop and oversee a strategy to protect the nation's secrets, trying to stay a step ahead of foreign spies by identifying what information -- in government and in industry -- would be the most enticing to other governments.</p>
        <p>The proposal, the product of a yearlong interagency review, gained support from Louis J. Freeh, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation; George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence, and John J. Hamre, who until recently was deputy secretary of defense, officials said.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Reno blocked the proposal, and some officials said they believed that her opposition was the product of her feud with Mr. Freeh, whose agency is charged with overseeing domestic counterintelligence.</p>
        <p>In letters and conversations with other officials, Ms. Reno indicated that she believed the agency needed to solve its own internal problems with counterintelligence instead of adding a new layer of bureaucracy.</p>
        <p>Ms. Reno and Mr. Freeh have been at odds over a wide variety of issues over the past few years, most notably Mr. Freeh's recommendation, which she rejected, that she appoint an independent counsel to investigate campaign fund-raising abuses by Democrats in the 1996 presidential election.</p>
        <p>Opposition to the counterintelligence plan, called CI-21, also surfaced within the F.B.I., where some senior officials were said to fear that it would erode the bureau's authority over spy-hunting operations.</p>
        <p>And some Clinton administration officials said they believed that the interagency panel, formed last summer, had gone too far by calling for  major changes in the counterintelligence structure without adequately consulting with other officials throughout the government.</p>
        <p>''The idea of a new counterintelligence executive is probably not going to work the way it was proposed,'' a senior administration official acknowledged.</p>
        <p>Still, officials said, many of the panel's ideas for changing the direction of counterintelligence may be incorporated in more a modest reorganization plan in the future.</p>
        <p>A high-level review of counterintelligence is still under way within the administration, they said.</p>
        <p>''It's clear that the CI-21 initiative has succeeded in focusing attention, and what will emerge from that is still evolving,'' said the Defense Department spokesman, Kenneth H. Bacon.</p>
        <p>Despite the debate over the proposed reorganization, there is widespread agreement among senior officials that the government has failed to keep pace with the rapidly changing espionage threats faced by the United States in a post-cold-war, information-age era.</p>
        <p>Critics agree that the F.B.I., the Central Intelligence Agency and the Pentagon have found it difficult to shift gears after decades spent keeping tabs on traditional adversaries, like K.G.B. agents working out of the Soviet embassy in Washington.</p>
        <p>Today, as the sole remaining economic and military superpower, the United States faces a wider range of espionage threats than ever before, from both allied and unfriendly nations eager to steal information not just from the C.I.A. or the Pentagon but from corporations and research institutes.</p>
        <p>France, Israel, China, India, Russia and other countries are believed to have turned their focus on the United States to obtain sensitive and economically significant scientific and technological information, as well as traditional military and national security secrets.</p>
        <p>Intelligence officials made some changes after the 1994 arrest of Aldrich H. Ames, the C.I.A. officer who spied for the Soviet Union. But several officials said they believed that the National Counterintelligence Center, established at the agency after the Ames case, had largely failed to provide coordination for counterintelligence. The center would have been abolished under the proposed restructuring.</p>
        <p>Flaws in the government's handling of some high-profile espionage cases, including the investigation of Wen Ho Lee, the former government scientist accused of mishandling government secrets, have underscored the need for counterintelligence reform, officials say.</p>
        <p>In the Lee case, an 800-page classified report by the Justice Department has just been completed detailing the mistakes made both at the F.B.I. and at the Justice Department in the way they handled investigation.</p>
        <p>The report is said to offer an even-handed critique of the government's failures in the Lee case.</p>
        <p>The report criticizes the F.B.I. for its failure to aggressively investigate evidence that China may have stolen American nuclear weapons data, as well as its decision to focus on Dr. Lee early in that investigation. But it also is critical of the Justice Department for its failure to approve F.B.I. requests to wiretap Dr. Lee.</p>
        <p>While he was never charged with espionage, Dr. Lee was accused of  mishandling classified material after investigators found that he had downloaded large amounts of sensitive nuclear weapons design information and then copied it onto portable computer tapes. Some of those tapes are now missing. Dr. Lee has said he is innocent of the charges.</p>
        <p>The reorganization proposed in the new initiative would not have altered the F.B.I.'s authority to handle criminal investigations into spy cases.</p>
        <p>But it would have created a board made up of senior officials from the C.I.A., F.B.I. and Pentagon and advised by other agencies like State and Treasury. Its executive would have set the broad direction of counterintelligence strategy, and would had access to information about ongoing espionage cases.</p>
        <p>''It's terribly unfortunate that the attorney general has seen fit to torpedo this, because the concept is very good and absolutely necessary as we face counterintelligence threats that are as great as ever,'' said Paul Redmond, a former chief of counterintelligence at the C.I.A.</p>
