        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''From Pariah to Poster Boy'' (Week in Review, May 28) is unfair to Latrell Sprewell. Yes, he choked his coach two and a half years ago, but he has earned his present praise as a result of two years of model behavior.</p>
        <p>Anyone who has seen Sprewell play since becoming a Knick cannot have failed to notice that he is always gracious to the referees, never confrontational with other players, is an unselfish team player and is considerate in all public responses. When was the last time a Knick regular had as few technical fouls over a two-year period?</p>

When was the last time a Knick regular had as few technical fouls over a two-year period?</p>
        <p>Your point that the public is often seduced by excellent athletic performance into forgetting bad behavior has general validity. But if ever an athlete has earned the right to respect after a bad deed, Sprewell has. How many years of proof are required for redemption after one impulsive act?</p>
