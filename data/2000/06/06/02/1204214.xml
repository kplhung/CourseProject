        <p>Two New Jersey state troopers who face trial in the 1998 shooting of three minority men in a van on the New Jersey Turnpike told the authorities they shot in self-defense as the van backed toward one of them. But the state released a court document Wednesday in which one of the men, Danny Reyes, said he had raised his hands and was pleading as a trooper shot him four times.</p>
        <p>''I put my hands straight up,'' Mr. Reyes told a state grand jury last year, according to the document. ''He looked right at me. I thought I was safe. He saw I had no weapons.''</p>
        <p>The state attorney general, John J. Farmer, submitted the document to New Jersey Superior Court in Trenton on Wednesday in response to a defense motion to dismiss the indictment against the two troopers, James Kenna and John Hogan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Farmer's brief provides the most detailed information made public on his office's investigation. The Star-Ledger, in Newark, and The Record, in Hackensack, reported on the document yesterday.</p>
        <p>In addition to summarizing the troopers' sworn statements and the grand jury testimony of Mr. Reyes and his three friends, the document discusses investigative conclusions that contradict some aspects of the troopers' accounts.</p>
        <p>The troopers fired 11 shots into a van they had stopped on the turnpike on a rainy April night in 1998. Mr. Reyes was one of four people in the van, all black or Hispanic men in their early 20's from New York City. No one was killed, but the case created an uproar over racial profiling -- the practice of singling out minority drivers for traffic stops -- by the New Jersey State Police and a vow by Gov. Christine Todd Whitman to end it. The troopers were indicted on charges of attempted murder and aggravated assault last September and are awaiting trial.</p>
        <p>According to the state's document, Mr. Reyes said he put his hands up  when Trooper Kenna started shattering the van's passenger window with his flashlight, as Mr. Reyes sat about three feet away.</p>
        <p>Then Trooper Kenna started shooting, Mr. Reyes said.</p>
        <p>Trooper Kenna continued shooting as Mr. Reyes, wounded in the arm, struggled to shift the van's transmission out of reverse as it rolled backward toward the troopers' patrol car, Mr. Reyes said.</p>
        <p>The troopers said they shot into the van in self-defense, because it started backing toward Trooper Hogan seconds after the stop.</p>
        <p>The troopers said they stopped the van near Washington Township because it was traveling 74 or 75 miles an hour. But investigators found that the van had moved an average of 62 m.p.h. on the turnpike, based on the time the driver got a toll ticket, the distance it traveled, and the time the shooting was reported.</p>
        <p>Trooper Hogan said he and Trooper Kenna became suspicious as they followed the van because of ''furtive movements'' by the four occupants, the document said. But two of the passengers, Rayshawn Brown and Jermaine Grant, said they were sleeping when the van was stopped. Mr. Reyes and the driver, Keshon Moore, said they were traveling about 55 m.p.h., listening to music. The four were driving to a college basketball clinic in North Carolina.</p>
        <p>The document quoted the troopers as saying the van's tires were spinning and squealing as it bolted backward toward Trooper Hogan and the patrol car. But the document said various tests, including a re-enactment, showed that the van moved backward at 4 m.p.h. and that the vehicle's tires could not spin or squeal while it was in reverse gear.</p>
        <p>Trooper Hogan was quoted as saying that the van hit him on the lower right leg and that he fired from a prone position on the highway. But a study of the trajectories of the five bullets he fired showed he moved and fired from a semi-crouch and a standing position. In addition, his pants had no rips or other evidence that the van had touched them, the document said.</p>
        <p>In his statement, Trooper Kenna said he broke the van's passenger side window because the van was backing up, he heard Trooper Hogan shout from the rear of the van and he thought the driver was trying to kill his partner. Trooper Hogan, however, told investigators he never shouted or yelled during the incident but fired toward the driver because he feared the van would hit and kill him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moore testified that he was nervous when stopped because he was driving with a suspended license. He told the grand jury that the shattering of the passenger window frightened him, and he ducked between the two front seats. He said he could not get the gear shift into park and could not recall pushing the accelerator.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Moore hid, Mr. Reyes reached over him and tried to shift the van into park, the document said. As he did, two of Trooper Kenna's bullets hit him in the right arm, another in the right thigh and a fourth in the right side of his chest, the document said.</p>
        <p>No drugs or weapons were found in the van, the document said. ''Clothing, a Bible and a book were recovered,'' it said.</p>
