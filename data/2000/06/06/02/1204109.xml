        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The report by the surgeon general that found that the poor are suffering from an ''epidemic of oral diseases'' (news article, May 26) is indeed horrifying. The Children's Aid Society, of which I am executive director, was the first social service agency to establish free dental and health care for the poor in the early 1900's. We now operate eight dental clinics in public schools and community centers, as well as a mobile dental van.</p>

        <p>Many schools had dental clinics in the 1940's and 50's, but they disappeared with budget cutbacks. We urge social agencies, Y.M.C.A.'s and Y.W.C.A.'s, settlement houses and public schools to re-establish preventive and restorative dental care in clinics to serve the poor and immigrant children who need this care the most.</p>
