        <p>Q.: Does a bull get mad when he sees red?</p>
        <p>A.: No. A cow gets mad when she sees red. A bull gets mad when people mistake him for a cow.</p>
        <p>OLD joke. But it brings to mind a reverse thought off what is becoming a commonplace theme: the Knicks are better without Patrick Ewing. In fact, what might be the case is, the Pacers are better without Rik Smits.</p>
        <p>Critics have grown louder about Ewing since the Knicks have won their only two playoff games against the Pacers this series without their longtime center, who was hobbled by injury in those two games.</p>
        <p>Ah, but consider Smits, his counterpart center. When the Pacers made their great run to overcome the Knicks' 18-point lead Wednesday in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals, Smits, for much of that time, had been replaced by Dale Davis. And Smits was scoreless in the game, 0 for 6 from the floor. He had 4 rebounds, compared with the substitute forward Derrick McKey, who gathered in 9. And in the final quarter, with the Pacers holding off the Knicks, to take the three-games-to-two lead in the series, Smits was a sedentary spectator.</p>
        <p>So, if Smits is in the game when Ewing is in the game -- and the Pacer strategy is obviously to insert Smits when Ewing is at his post -- then perhaps the Knicks are actually better with Ewing in the game because that means that Smits is in the game.</p>
        <p>Food for thought, no?</p>
        <p>Remember Game 3, when Smits scored 21 points in the first half? The Pacers could manage only a 1-point lead at the half. And they lost, with Smits scoring just 4 points in the second half. Of course, both Smits and Ewing have had their superb moments recently, but those sweet minutes are becoming more rare. Ewing was superb, to be sure, in the first quarter of Game 5, scoring 9 of his 13 points, including one dazzling spin layup. He even made a pretty pass, for his lone assist in the game. And the glorious effort, it seemed, wore the warrior out.</p>
        <p>Smits came out with some remarks the other day that he'd rather play against Ewing than the spryer Knickerbockers. This riled Knick Coach Jeff Van Gundy. ''How,'' asked Van Gundy, in effect, ''does Smits have the nerve to diss my future Hall of Famer?''</p>
        <p>Smits, as it were, was simply being honest. He loves it when Ewing is reluctant to challenge him when he's ogling the hoop to launch a 3-pointer. And Smits, like Ewing, aging belligerents both, are so battered from metatarsal to patella to pectoralis major, that at times it seems the only way they can drive to the basket is nurse-aided.</p>
        <p>After the Knicks' practice yesterday at SUNY-Purchase and before Game 6 tonight in Madison Square Garden, Ewing was given, as the pols say, equal time. Did he believe the Pacers were better without Smits? ''I don't care about that stuff,'' Ewing said. ''I have nothing to say about it. My foot is sore and I'm going to ice it. I'll be ready for tomorrow.''</p>
        <p>And Van Gundy on Ewing's value in this year's playoffs: ''We beat Miami with Patrick on the floor.'' And the Smits factor? ''No, the Pacers aren't better without Smits. What matters is how a group on the floor is playing. There's no set, predictable group at any time. It's all a human factor, how players are playing. It varies from game to game.''</p>
        <p>So Van Gundy, to avoid elimination tonight, has to be concerned not only with Smits versus Ewing, but also with Travis Best, the Pacer point guard, who, Van Gundy says, gets better every game, from no points in Game 1 to 24 points in Game 5. And he must be concerned with Jalen Rose, who is a terror when he's not in a stupor. And Mark Jackson, who does everything to the smaller Knick guards but bully them for pocket change.</p>
        <p>And, of course, there is still Reggie Miller, who has been relatively quiet in this series -- after two spectacular series against Milwaukee and Philadelphia leading into this one. The impression here is that Miller, invariably a menace to the Knicks, is just hiding behind a door waiting to jump out and shout, ''Boo!''</p>
        <p>Not only do moves on the court separate one player from the other, but also which players are put on the court and when separates one coach from another. That's why some players are better than others, and some coaches are better than others. Ewing and Smits both, if used wisely, can contribute handsomely. Both, however, have a tendency to slow their teams down.</p>
        <p>Enter Larry Bird, Pacer coach. Enter Van Gundy. Let the profundity begin.</p>
