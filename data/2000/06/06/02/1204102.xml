        <p>The Little Orchestra Society's production of Vivaldi's ''Tamerlano'' at Alice Tully Hall on Wednesday was the second American premiere performance of an opera by the composer within a month. At this rate, the store of unheard Vivaldi pieces will last only a few more years.</p>
        <p>No need to worry, though. When all of Vivaldi has been done, there will still be the more than 100 operas of Johann Hasse or those of the more obscure Geminiano Giacomelli -- two composers to be mentioned in this context because they, unwittingly, wrote almost as much of ''Tamerlano'' as Vivaldi did himself.</p>

        <p>The Little Orchestra Society's production of Vivaldi's ''Tamerlano'' at Alice Tully Hall on Wednesday was the second American premiere performance of an opera by the composer within a month. At this rate, the store of unheard Vivaldi pieces will last only a few more years.</p>
        <p>No need to worry, though. When all of Vivaldi has been done, there will still be the more than 100 operas of Johann Hasse or those of the more obscure Geminiano Giacomelli -- two composers to be mentioned in this context because they, unwittingly, wrote almost as much of ''Tamerlano'' as Vivaldi did himself.</p>
        <p>In the early 18th century, composers bothered to compose only when they could not steal, from their own previous works or from those of colleagues. Singers, too, might insist on thrusting favorite arias into the mix. Since the same situations reappeared in libretto after libretto -- fury at an unwanted proposition of love, confusion at the perplexing behavior of a lover -- arias could be shuffled to fit any number of stories.</p>
        <p>The idea of the inviolable work of art had not penetrated the feverishly busy opera houses of Europe at the time. And, as Dino Anagnost explained before conducting this performance, the composer was near the bottom of the operatic pyramid, with the leading singers right up close to the top.</p>
        <p>In some ways this hierarchy has not changed; in other ways it has. The only reason to revive ''Tamerlano'' now is out of a fascination with Vivaldi: great singers are not clamoring to perform it. Indeed it may be hard to find singers adequate to the demands of arias written as display pieces for stars -- and stars with the very special vocal accomplishments of the period.</p>
        <p>This performance showed the problem. All the soloists, singing from the book but costumed and in a rudimentary staging, addressed themselves honorably to the task. Many displayed useful virtues. Ellen Rabiner as Tamerlano and Melanie Sonnenberg as Asteria were mezzos of creamy tone and forceful low register. Julia Anne Wolf, assigned the fiercely virtuoso role of Irene, found moments of vividness. Tambra King (Idaspe) came out with a striking cadenza in the da capo of her last aria. Philip Cutlip, as the captive Ottoman emperor Bajazette, projected frustrated strength. But only Jane Dutton, as Andronico, sounded free, noble and at ease in this extremely difficult music.</p>
        <p>Mr. Anagnost and his players were satisfactory in an orchestral score that has few treasures, outside Asteria's recitative monologue on death, which is marked by a very present and ominous bass line. In an unfortunate effort at education, the performance was encumbered with a part for the composer as narrator. This Tim Jerome did, minimizing the embarrassment.</p>
