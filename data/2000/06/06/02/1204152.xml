        <p>In the latest indication that the Jersey City waterfront has become a corporate haven, Chase Manhattan Bank, the second-largest bank in the country, is moving thousands of employees from Lower Manhattan to two new office towers at the Newport complex.</p>
        <p>The Giuliani administration tried desperately to keep the bank from leasing space across the Hudson River, but the tax breaks offered by the city could not compete with a  better deal in Jersey City. State officials in New Jersey dangled subsidies worth tens of millions of dollars, and Samuel J. LeFrak, the developer, promised to build an office tower within 18 months, according to real estate executives and local officials.</p>
        <p>Chase's search for office space and bargaining for tax breaks recalls an earlier tug of war across the Hudson River, one that New York won. Twelve years ago, Chase had nearly closed a deal to move 5,000 technical jobs to a proposed 1.5 million-square-foot tower at the Newport project. At the last minute, Edward I. Koch, who was then mayor, got wind of the deal and persuaded Chase to remain in New York with the largest municipal tax break ever granted to a New York company: $235 million. The bank then moved the jobs and its computer operations to the Metrotech Center in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>The bank is joining Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, which recently announced plans to erect the tallest building in Jersey City, a 45-story, 1.6 million-square-foot tower at the former site of a Colgate toothpaste factory. Merrill Lynch &amp; Company is building its own tower nearby, and Paine Webber, U.S. Trust and Lord, Abbett &amp; Company have all taken large blocks of space in the past year.</p>
        <p>Judy Miller, a spokeswoman for Chase, declined to comment, as did the bank's broker, Insignia/ESG, and Lloyd Kaplan, a spokesman for Mr. LeFrak, whose family owns the 600-acre Newport complex. But several executives said the two sides had struck a deal in which the developer would build two office towers totaling 1.1 million square feet for about 4,000 employees. Chase would move its staff from 55 Water Street and still have room to expand in Jersey City. The bank's headquarters would remain at 270 Park Avenue.</p>
        <p>''We think Chase is an excellent fit,'' said Tom Gallagher, chief of staff for Bret Schundler, the Jersey City mayor, ''and we welcome them as the latest Fortune 500 company to come to the Jersey City waterfront.''</p>
        <p>Michael Carey, president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation, did not return calls requesting comment, nor did a spokeswoman for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. Word of a pending deal was reported on Tuesday in The New York Post.</p>
        <p>Chase's decision to move some jobs to New Jersey could renew criticism that the Giuliani administration has not developed alternative sites for less expensive back office space to house support staff in Brooklyn or Queens during the current real estate boom.</p>
        <p>''This should be a signal to policy makers that New York needs an aggressive development policy to meet the growing demand by firms to do business in New York City,'' said Mitchell Moss, director of New York University's Taub Urban Research Center. ''We can't afford to let other firms follow Chase across the river.''</p>
        <p>Rents for prime office space in Midtown and Lower Manhattan have soared to $50 a square foot and higher since the recession in the early and mid-1990's. And few large blocks of space are available.</p>
        <p>Many corporate tenants, in turn, have hunted for cheap space in industrial areas of Manhattan, as well as in Jersey City and Hoboken. Metrotech, the back office complex that Mr. Koch promoted in the early 1980's, is practically full. While most economists said that it makes little difference to the regional economy whether a company is located in Manhattan, Stamford or Parsippany, local politicians have competed to lure companies with billions of dollars in tax breaks.</p>
        <p>Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, said he was concerned ''that high rents are forcing companies to reconsider their presence in New York. We need to look into how we can create more affordable back office space in Manhattan, or the surrounding boroughs.''</p>
        <p>Only recently, real estate brokers said, have major corporate tenants been willing to cross the seemingly wide cultural and psychological gulf between Manhattan and Jersey City, which was regarded as a backwater. They were helped along by cheaper rents in Jersey City, enormous tax incentives and a quick ride via a PATH train or ferry. Jersey City is now referred to as the West Bank of Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''The waterfront is extremely active right now,'' said Peter Eppie, executive vice president for SJP Properties, which is building office towers for Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette in Jersey City and for John Wiley &amp; Sons in Hoboken. ''There are an awful lot of major companies looking at space, and the number of available sites is dwindling.''</p>
        <p>Last year, Chase announced that it was looking for one million square feet of office space in Manhattan and elsewhere. The bank talked to a number of developers about building a headquarters in Midtown and made what has become a corporate tenant's obligatory trip to Jersey City, if only to force New York into offering tax breaks.</p>
        <p>But Chase changed its strategy earlier this year and abandoned its quest for a new headquarters as too expensive. Last month, the bank leased 14 floors, or 556,000 square feet, at 1166 Avenue of the Americas, which would allow it to move some employees out of the cramped headquarters building on Park Avenue.</p>
        <p>Less than two months ago, Chase began negotiating in earnest with the LeFraks, who were starting construction of an 800,000-square-foot tower at Newport without a tenant. A confident Mr. LeFrak had already built and leased two other buildings last year and had bought the steel to construct a third. But executives who know him said he was wary of dealing with Chase because it had backed out of their deal in 1988. The developer told the bank that he already had a potential tenant, but whoever signed a deal first would get the building.</p>
        <p>Chase also talked to officials in New Jersey, where the state offers new companies a rebate of up to 80 percent of the state income taxes the new jobs generate for 10 years. One person said the incentive package offered to Chase is worth about $100 million.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the Giuliani administration offered Chase increasingly larger tax breaks if the bank would stay put. But, one real estate executive said, city officials were also slow to respond, in part because Mayor Giuliani was then engaged in the race for the Senate. The tempo picked up after the mayor dropped out of the race, but it was a lost cause by then. Chase had already decided to cross the Hudson, to where rents and other costs were 30 percent lower, and sign a deal for two buildings.</p>
        <p>''Once they hurdle the river, you can't touch the economic benefits of Jersey,'' said one real estate executive involved in the talks. ''No incentive package from New York could've mitigated the difference.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Koch said yesterday that he was saddened by the bank's decision. ''I wish them well,'' he said, ''but I can no longer refer to them as Chase Manhattan.''</p>
