        <p>The Golden Jet is looking up at his son.</p>
        <p>Brett Hull delivered the 15th multigoal playoff game of his career to move past his father, Bobby, for sixth best on the career list. After scoring the game-winner with 4 minutes 16 seconds remaining tonight, the younger Hull now has 21 game-winning goals in the playoffs, second only to Wayne Gretzky, who had 24.</p>
        <p>Until last season, Brett Hull had never won a Stanley Cup. Now, he and the Stars are looking for their second straight following tonight's 2-1 victory over the Devils, which evened the four-of-seven-game Stanley Cup finals at one victory each.</p>
        <p>''I think Hully deserves a lot of credit,'' Dallas Coach Ken Hitchcock said after Hull delivered both of his team's goals. ''It's tough when you are an older player who played in the league when it was a little more wide open.</p>
        <p>''It is a difficult decision that you have to make in your career when you know that the game is so closed off now,'' said Hitchcock, who preaches a disciplined, defense-first style of game. There's not a lot of open space. Rather than look for it, you have to be able to go out and fight for your space.''</p>
        <p>Earlier in his career, Hull would never have bought into such a system.</p>
        <p>''Hully is prepared to do that now,'' Hitchcock said. ''He is a committed guy. He's committed to this team. He's committed to the organization. He deserves a tremendous amount of credit for changing, because it is hard. It's really hard when there is no open ice out there and things are closed off.''</p>
        <p>Hull, though, was not speaking much after the game.</p>
        <p>''It seems like this playoffs, he doesn't talk as much,'' said Guy Carbonneau, one of the Stars' many veteran leaders. ''He does his talking on the ice.''</p>
        <p>Hull just laughed when he heard that.</p>
        <p>''We have too many guys here who can speak for the team,'' the 35-year-old right wing said. ''Their leadership and years of experience far exceeds mine in these situations, so, yes, I let them do all the talking. I usually just get myself in trouble anyway.''</p>
        <p>As the series shifts to Dallas for Games 3 and 4, however, the Devils now find themselves in trouble because of Hull.</p>
        <p>Offensively, the Stars often seem like a one-line team. Hull leads all players in goals, with 11, and points, with 22, in the playoffs. Center Mike Modano, who assisted on both of Hull's goals, is second to his right wing in both categories with 9 goals and 21 points.</p>
        <p>In 149 career playoff games, Hull has scored 88 goals, fifth best in league history. The game-winner tonight came with overtime in sight. Hull redirected a Jere Lehtinen shot past Martin Brodeur. The goal was fittingly set up by a New Jersey turnover in the neutral zone, courtesy of the Dallas trap.</p>
        <p>The Stars' game plan sometimes seems as if it is to bore the opposition into Dallas scoring chances. The Stars might have  been credited with only three first period shots tonight, but one went in for Hull at 4:25 into the game to give the Stars the early 1-0 lead.</p>
        <p>Hull had handcuffed Martin Brodeur with a shot from the top of the left circle. Brodeur might have been screened by Scott Stevens on the play. Hull sure was as the shot beat Brodeur.</p>
        <p>''I think the first goal was just a lot of hard work by Jere and Mike as usual,'' Hull said. ''I was just trying to stay in a good position as the third man. Mike got it to me and I just hurled it and shot it as quick and as hard as I could. I didn't even know that one went in.</p>
        <p>''On the second one, I don't even know how the puck got turned over. I saw Jere going wide to the net, and I kind of saw him flip it to the front of the net, and I just threw my stick out there. I didn't know that went in either until I saw Mike raise his arms.''</p>
