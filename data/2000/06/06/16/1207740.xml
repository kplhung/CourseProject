        <p>CBS's enormous summer hit, ''Survivor,'' soared to new ratings heights Wednesday night, pulling in more viewers than CBS has had on any Wednesday night since the Nielsen Media Research company transformed its ratings system in 1987.</p>
        <p>Three weeks of growing ratings convinced CBS to announce formally yesterday that it would broadcast ''Survivor II, the Australian Outback,'' in the middle of the coming television season, starting in either January or February.</p>
        <p>Given the impact that ABC's ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' had on the last television season, when it expanded from a summer show to a regular-season show, ''Survivor'' has the potential to turn around CBS's ratings fortunes completely, possibly making the network a contender for the overall television leadership next season.</p>
        <p>The network began asking for participants in the next edition of ''Survivor'' after its broadcast Wednesday night. It also announced that it would move up the starting date of its follow-up reality show, ''Big Brother,'' one day, to Wednesday, July 5, at 9 p.m., to take advantage of the big audience flowing out of ''Survivor,'' which will be shown from 8 to 9.</p>
        <p>This week, without the impediment of ''Millionaire,'' which ABC had placed opposite ''Survivor'' the first two weeks of its run, the CBS reality-adventure series added about 5 million viewers, for a total of just over 23 million.</p>
        <p>That was some seven million more viewers than NBC attracted with Game 4 of the National Basketball Association finals Wednesday night. It was also more viewers than ABC had for any edition of ''Millionaire'' last August, when that show quickly established itself as a television phenomenon.</p>
        <p>In addition, ''Survivor'' eclipsed viewing levels for one of CBS's biggest sports events, the National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball championship game.</p>
        <p>Once again, ''Survivor'' proved to be an especially powerful draw with young viewers, bringing in more viewers between the ages of 18 and 34 than any series show that played on CBS all last season. Last night a young participant was finally voted off the island where the show is being staged. Stacey Stillman, a 27-year-old lawyer from San Francisco, was eliminated in a vote by her teammates. In the first two shows. two participants in their 60's were voted out.</p>
        <p>CBS executives yesterday predicted that the show would do even better as the weeks go on and the countdown to an eventual final survivor continues. The show will run through August, with the final episode coming down to two survivors, one of whom will win $1 million. The winner will be selected by the seven previously rejected survivors.</p>
        <p>Like the previous losing contestants, Ms. Stillman made numerous television appearances yesterday from the CBS ''Early Show'' to CNN, Fox News and MSNBC. She also appeared on David Letterman's show on CBS last night.</p>
