        <p>Every June when the list is released, it is met with a certain amount of criticism. One year it was attacked for excluding women and another year for including only women.

        <p>The Tate Gallery in London has announced the finalists for its 2000 Turner Prize, the prestigious $32,000 award given annually to a British artist under 50.</p>
        <p>Every June when the list is released, it is met with a certain amount of criticism. One year it was attacked for excluding women and another year for including only women. One year people said it was lacking in painters in favor of video artists. This year's list -- three men and one woman -- includes two painters. Three of the four artists are not British-born.</p>
        <p>None are among the trendy Y.B.A.'s, or ''Young British Artists.'' The native Briton, Glenn Brown, was included in ''Sensation: Young British Artists From the Saatchi Collection,'' shown at both the Royal Academy in London and the Brooklyn Museum, but he has never been considered one of the high-profile Y.B.A.'s.</p>
        <p>''We've moved on,'' said Nicholas Serota, director of the Tate. ''This year's list shows a depth and range of cultural focus.''</p>
        <p>The three artists who are not British-born, Mr. Serota added, have lived in the London area for more than 10 years, in part because London has good art schools and is a stimulating place for young artists.</p>
        <p>Besides Mr. Brown, a photo realist painter, the list includes Michael Raedecker, a painter whose work incorporates thread and embroidery; Tomoko Takahashi, whose sprawling installations incorporate detritus and snapshots; and Wolfgang Tillmans, a photographer known for his still lifes of clothes and portraits.</p>
        <p>The finalists' work will be on view at the Tate Britain at Millbank from Oct. 25 to Jan. 14 . The winner is to be announced on Nov. 28.</p>
        <p>Antiquities Acquired</p>
        <p>The Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth went shopping at this week's antiquities sales in New York and ended up buying two exceptionally rare pieces: a Greek vase from the fifth century B.C. and a bronze Roman head dating from about the first century B.C.</p>
        <p>The vase, which the museum bought at Christie's for $1.7 million, was from the collection of Elie Borowski, a collector and curator of antiquities at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto. Dating from around 480 B.C., the vase measures 11 1/2 inches in diameter and has painted scenes on both the interior and exterior.</p>
        <p>The head, which the Kimbell bought at Sotheby's for $4.5 million, a record for a classical antiquity and an ancient bronze, measures 11 3/4 inches in height. A Roman copy of a lost Greek original, the head is believed to have been discovered in the 16th century and was acquired by the 18th-century Venetian collector Bernardo Nani. More recently it was owned by Hans Calmann, a London dealer in old master drawings.</p>
        <p>''The two objects will transform our classical collection, which hasn't been one of our strongest departments,'' said Timothy Potts, director of the Kimbell. ''There hasn't been anything like these pieces on the market for decades.''</p>
        <p>Italian Photographs</p>
        <p>Building an impressive photography collection has been a high priority for the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston. When it opened its $50 million building in March, the museum had its first permanent photography gallery. In January it acquired 22 photographs by artists including Diane Arbus, Gerhard Richter and William Eggleston. Recently, its photography curator, Anne Wilkes Tucker, has turned toward collecting Italian photographs from the 1940's and 50's.</p>
        <p>She approached Giorgio Borlenghi, a Houston real estate developer, and his sister Ermy, both contributors to the museum and both acquainted with this period in Italian photography. With money from Mr. Borlenghi and his wife, Cathy, and Ermy Borlenghi and her husband, Gordon Bonfield, along with help from some trustees, the museum formed the Carla and Lorenzo Borlenghi Collection, named after Giorgio and Ermy's parents.</p>
        <p>The collection consists of 18 photographs by photographers who worked in Florence, Milan, Venice and Rome. ''There were different aesthetics and schools,'' Ms. Tucker said. ''Rome was the center of paparazzi photographs, while Florence and Venice produced work that was more formalist and abstract.''</p>
        <p>Among the photographs acquired are five by Tazio Secchiaroli. Secchiaroli, who died two years ago, was the celebrity-hounding photographer who was the inspiration for Paparazzo, the central character in Federico Fellini's 1960 film ''La Dolce Vita.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Tucker said the Italian photographs would be part of an exhibition going on view in February 2002.</p>
        <p>New Costume Curator</p>
        <p>After the much-publicized cancellation of the Coco Chanel retrospective, which was to be the Costume Institute's big exhibition in December, officials at the Metropolitan Museum issued a statement saying that the death of Richard Martin, its chief curator of the Costume Institute, in November made the Chanel show impossible to organize. He had initiated the show, and the Met had no one to fill his shoes.</p>
        <p>While people in the art and fashion worlds expressed strong views -- both for and against canceling the show, which was to be financed by Chanel -- and with no one inside the museum able to plan such a complex project, the museum may have felt more pressure than ever to name a successor to Mr. Martin.</p>
        <p>This week it announced that Harold Koda, an associate curator of the Costume Institute in the mid-1990's, was returning as its curator-in-charge. Mr. Koda is to start at the Met on Nov. 6 after serving as a co-curator with Germano Celant of the Giorgio Armani exhibition that opens at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in October.</p>
        <p>The Met also announced that James C. Y. Watt, a senior curator and expert on Chinese art, had been named chairman of the museum's department of Asian art. He succeeds Wen C. Fong, who is retiring on June 30 and will become a curator emeritus.</p>
