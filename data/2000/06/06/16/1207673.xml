        <p>HYBRID-POWER vehicles, the engineers point out, can come in all shapes and sizes. The first two on the market are the two-passenger Honda Insight and the five-passenger Toyota Prius.</p>
        <p>They are notable for using electric motors to achieve remarkable gasoline fuel economy. And they look like hybrids: eggy, sleek and futuristic.</p>
        <p>But DaimlerChrysler is demonstrating another tack entirely.</p>
        <p>Call it the red-meat hybrid, an S.U.V. as brawny as a pure gasoline version, in exactly the same body, with the same tough-looking wheels and grille, and four-wheel drive. But this Dodge Durango is modified to get 30 percent of its horsepower through an electric motor instead of from the gasoline engine. As with the Japanese entries, the result is better fuel economy. The improvement is just three miles per gallon, but on a big sport utility like the Durango, that is a full 20 percent.</p>
        <p>DaimlerChrysler showed the truck here recently at the conclusion of the American Tour de Sol, an annual electric-car race.</p>
        <p>An early fan was Senator Frank H. Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, who is chairman of the Energy Committee. ''Feels like a normal car,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In contrast to the Insight, a two-seater that gets about 70 miles per gallon but owes part of that to its sleek form and aluminum frame, or the Prius, which has a slightly boxy appearance, the hybrid Durango prototype is indistinguishable from the gasoline version -- unless you spot the ''state of charge'' meter on the dashboard, or crawl under the front to see the 70-horsepower electric motor, mounted sideways, that drives the front wheels.</p>
        <p>''This is the soccer mom car,'' Senator Murkowski said.</p>
        <p>It is also, by far, the simplest of the three. The Insight has an electric motor sandwiched into the drivetrain between the gasoline engine and the manual transmission. The Prius has a planetary gear, a specially developed device that means that at any given moment, the electric motor can be working alone, or assisting the gasoline engine, or draining energy from the gasoline engine to recharge the battery.</p>
        <p>The Durango is far simpler; an ordinary V-6 gasoline engine in the front drives ordinary wheels in the back, and the electric motor under the front of the car turns the front wheels; the only connection between the two drivetrains is the pavement. When the driver pushes the brake pedal, the electric motor switches into a generator, robbing the car of momentum and converting that into current to recharge the batteries.</p>
        <p>If the batteries are depleted as the car cruises, the motor in front will start letting the wheels drag a little and recharge the batteries, using the pavement to transfer energy from the gasoline system to the electric one.</p>
        <p>''This is a leap in technology that can get you an instant improvement,'' said William Craven, a project-management specialist who works on the Durango and the Epic, the company's all-electric minivan.</p>
        <p>His competitor, David W. Hermance, an executive engineer at Toyota, whose car and its unusual gearing system is perhaps more of a leap, put it differently.</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview, he said: ''There are three attributes you're trading off -- emissions, fuel economy and acceleration, or performance. You decide what it is you want your vehicle to do in those three attributes, and then you size your internal-combustion engine and your motor so as to get the combination you're interested in.''</p>
        <p>To get acceleration, Mr. Hermance said, use a larger gasoline engine; to get better fuel economy and pollution control, favor the electric side.</p>
        <p>The Toyota relies on the electric motor alone when it is moving slowly, and the Honda makes heavy use of the electric motor every time the driver shifts to a higher gear; both shut off the gasoline engine entirely when the car is waiting at a stop sign or red light.</p>
        <p>Both of them were designed as hybrids, from the ground up. And both, but especially the Honda, gain performance by shedding weight. Their performance is good but nothing special.</p>
        <p>In contrast, the Durango weighs the same in the hybrid version, and performs about the same -- that is to say, like a hard-charging bull. It has a slightly lower towing rating than the all-gasoline version of the Durango. The Prius and Insight, on the other hand, are unlikely candidates to tow anything.</p>
        <p>Chrysler said that teaming the 3.9 liter V-6 with a Siemens 3-phase AC induction motor gave ''V-8 performance with better than V-6 fuel economy.''</p>
        <p>In the parlance of this emerging technology, the Durango is a ''mild hybrid,'' and the Insight and Prius are ''heavy hybrids.''</p>
        <p>There are other differences. The Prius and Insight have no direct cost comparisons, since they are not new versions of an all-gasoline car, but both appear to sell at a modest premium above what a conventional gasoline car that size would cost.</p>
        <p>American manufacturers suggest that Toyota and Honda are actually taking considerable losses on each of the cars sold, something that DaimlerChrysler does not seem willing to do.</p>
        <p>DaimlerChrysler says each hybrid Durango would cost $3,000 extra to make; it is lobbying for special tax credits.</p>
        <p>The Japanese entries are on the road now. The population of hybrid Durangos is one lonely preproduction prototype. If the Chrysler division decided now to produce it, the hybrid would go on sale in about three years.</p>
