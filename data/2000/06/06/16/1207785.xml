        <p>The Security Council today urged visiting ministers from a half-dozen African nations embroiled in the war in Congo to join in seeking a way out of the desperate conflict that continues to devastate the biggest country in central Africa.</p>
        <p>The message -- repeated as two days of talks got under way here -- was that the United Nations could accomplish nothing to stem such carnage and alleviate Congo's suffering without active help from its African neighbors.</p>
        <p>France, which holds the council's rotating presidency this month, circulated a new draft resolution that expressed ''deep concern'' over the continuing hostilities in Congo.</p>
        <p>The draft resolution demanded ''the orderly withdrawal of all foreign forces'' from Congo, with a four-month deadline for Rwanda and Uganda to pull out their troops, which battered the city of Kisangani earlier this month in fighting each other. Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe have supported President Laurent Kabila's government in Congo.</p>
        <p>The resolution welcomed the participation in today's meeting of a political committee formed under the cease-fire agreement reached last July in the Zambian capital, Lusaka. Senior officials at today's session came from Congo, Angola, Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe, as well as two Congolese rebel movements and the Organization of African Unity.</p>
        <p>The complexity of achieving any consensus was underscored when Rwanda's foreign minister, Ande Bumaya, said that Rwandan troops could not leave without security guarantees that Hutu rebels would stop using Congo as a base for attacking his country.</p>
        <p>The Security Council previously authorized the dispatch of 5,537 peacekeepers to Congo, but there has been a mounting reluctance to commit them to monitoring a cease-fire that has yet to take hold.</p>
        <p>The secretary general's special representative to Congo, Kamel Morjane, told the council today that the troops earmarked for peacekeeping in the country were not nearly enough, and said an extra battalion was needed just to prevent new fighting over Kisangani. He also proposed extending the date now set for a peacekeeping contingent to begin deploying in Congo early next month.</p>
        <p>The chief United States representative, Richard M. Holbrooke, who visited the region five weeks ago with other council representatives, said there was ''no excuse for what happened in Kisangani,'' where the latest fighting between Rwandan and Ugandan troops killed at least 160 Congolese civilians and injured another 1,000.</p>
        <p>The fighting, Mr. Holbrooke said, made it more difficult to recruit peacekeeping forces to go to Congo because the duty had become more dangerous.</p>
        <p>He also rejected writing off Congo as a failed nation. ''States don't fail,'' Mr. Holbrooke said. ''Leaders do.''</p>
        <p>In a report to the Security Council last week, Secretary General Kofi Annan asked council members to make it clear to the warring parties in Congo ''that their assurances of support for the peace process and guarantees of security and freedom of movement can no longer be taken at face value, but must be reflected in their actions.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Annan pointed out that one-third of Congo's population, or 16 million people, critically needed food, more than 1.5 million were displaced and 5 million were completely or partially isolated from their traditional supply routes.</p>
        <p>He also referred to a cholera outbreak and growing H.I.V. infection rates.</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 17, 2000, Saturday  An article yesterday about talks at the United Nations on the war in Congo misspelled the name of Secretary General Kofi Annan's special representative to Congo in some copies. He is Kamel Morjane, not Kamal Moranje. The article also misstated Congo's size ranking in Africa in some copies. It is not the largest country; Sudan is.</p>
