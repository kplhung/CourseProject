        <p>At first look, the quaint fishing port of Gloucester, Mass., seems an unlikely hangout for the jazzy city painter Stuart Davis (1894-1964). But Davis loved the place, with its sea-brightened light, its rocky coast, its maritime activity and its art colony goings-on. Besides Davis, these attributes lured well-known painters over the years, including Winslow Homer, William Morris Hunt and Frank Duveneck in the late 19th century, and Edward Hopper, John Sloan, Childe Hassam, William Glackens and Milton Avery in the 20th.</p>
        <p>Gloucester, Davis wrote in his 1945 autobiography, was the place he had been looking for: ''It had the brilliant light of Provincetown, but with the important additions of topographical severity and the architectural beauties of the Gloucester schooner. I wandered over the rocks, moors and docks with a sketching easel, large canvases and a pack on my back, looking for things to paint.''</p>

        <p>At first look, the quaint fishing port of Gloucester, Mass., seems an unlikely hangout for the jazzy city painter Stuart Davis (1894-1964). But Davis loved the place, with its sea-brightened light, its rocky coast, its maritime activity and its art colony goings-on. Besides Davis, these attributes lured well-known painters over the years, including Winslow Homer, William Morris Hunt and Frank Duveneck in the late 19th century, and Edward Hopper, John Sloan, Childe Hassam, William Glackens and Milton Avery in the 20th.</p>
        <p>Gloucester, Davis wrote in his 1945 autobiography, was the place he had been looking for: ''It had the brilliant light of Provincetown, but with the important additions of topographical severity and the architectural beauties of the Gloucester schooner. I wandered over the rocks, moors and docks with a sketching easel, large canvases and a pack on my back, looking for things to paint.''</p>
        <p>Davis, in fact, had been drawn to Gloucester by Sloan, a friend of his family, and spent almost every summer there from 1915 to 1934. He first went with his mother, Helen, a sculptor, and his brother, Wyatt. In 1925 his parents acquired a house, and Davis -- by then very much part of the summer scene -- set up his painting studio in it. Did Gloucester and its well-worn motifs play a role in the lively and innovative American Cubist style that Davis eventually developed? No doubt about it, as evidenced by ''Stuart Davis in Gloucester,'' a show of some 45 oils, watercolors and drawings at the National Academy of Design, organized by the Cape Ann Historical Association with the art critic Karen Wilkin as curator.</p>
        <p>By the time he got to Gloucester, however, Davis had already been hit with Armory shock, caused by the big-bang 1913 show in New York that gave American innocents their first real experience of European modernist art. As a matter of fact, Davis, who worked at cartooning and illustrating while studying with the Ashcan painter Robert Henri, exhibited no fewer than five watercolors at the Armory Show (priced at $100 each). They were animatedly realistic, but when he saw them in context, he decided he had to think in more progressive terms. He turned to the Fauvist and Cubist modes he saw there for the first time.</p>
        <p>Among the standout early works he did in his summer place is a reductive Fauvish landscape, ''Hillside Near Gloucester'' (1915-16). A crisp tree with a pale lavender trunk next to a large aquamarine rock is set against a bright lavender-blue sky that Matisse himself would not have scorned. In paintings like ''Rocky Neck, Gloucester'' and ''Airview'' (both 1916), Davis seems to be trying his hand at Cubist structure, piling together the geometric shapes of houses and buildings and pushing their landscapes into planar thrusts.</p>
        <p>In his efforts to become a ''modernist'' painter, Davis tried a number of styles, producing work far more experimental than that of his fellow artists. Much of it was cued by the European avant-gardists he had admired at the Armory show, like  van Gogh, Matisse and Picasso. But  though he didn't turn away from the picturesque themes offered by Gloucester, Ms. Wilkin points out in her ''Stuart Davis in Gloucester,'' a book accompanying the show, he often applied the Modernist notions he saw at the Armory show to subjects more in line with the gritty philosophy of Henri and the Ashcan School: backyards, sheds and outhouses, and working streetscapes with garages, gas pumps and cars.</p>
        <p>An example of Davis's more mundane interests is the painting ''Coal Derrick'' (1916), a view of the harbor divided in the middle by a long, ungainly black apparatus used to hoist coal from ships. It sits in the water close to a harbor shoreline tightly packed with a Cubist jumble of houses, while flattened fingers of land jut out from another angle.</p>
        <p>In ''Multiple Views'' (1918), he makes an awkward pass at an important Cubist notion, that of simultaneity. A number of separate Gloucester vignettes are compressed into one painting: houses, figures, the facade of a garage, a tree, a tower, landscape elements and less readable forms, all on a flat surface plane. Crude as it is, the work anticipates his later, stylized landscapes like ''Report From Rockport'' (1940; not in the show) that meld abstract and semi-abstract bits and pieces into a busy, complex whole whose colors dazzle.</p>
        <p>Some of the paintings of the early 1920's seem to flounder, suffering from Davis's laborious attempts to go further with Cubism. ''Garden Scene'' (1921), painted in muddy colors, is a rambling collection of flattened, largely geometric shapes in search of a composition. But by the mid-1920's, his work had lightened up. He was beginning to hit his stride, as evidenced in the sprightly watercolor ''Gas Pumps'' (1925).</p>
        <p>A jaunty red caricature of a pump with price (was gasoline ever really 36 cents a gallon?) is poised on the edge of a heavily stylized harbor scene with boats and sea gulls, the sea conveyed by a set of straight horizontal lines. The scene, anchored at either end by the pump and a buoylike form, is partially framed within a linear trapezoid, in turn enclosed by a more irregular geometric outline. It's a slight drawing, but it anticipates the later work for which Davis is celebrated: the snappy compositions -- tied together by ingenious linearities -- cued by neon signs, billboards, rushing traffic, the beat of jazz and other elements by which he so deftly conveyed the cacophony of modern life.</p>
        <p>Some of the later paintings in the show already illustrate the bouncy, energetic shorthand that characterizes Davis's mature styles, among them ''Sail Loft'' (1933), an intricate canvas in which stylized parts of boats, wharves, water, fishing shacks, rope and other nautical mementos are strategically melded in a tightly designed composition. By this time, Davis had already established a reputation with his first abstract paintings, the influential ''Eggbeater'' series of 1927.</p>
        <p>The exhibition includes a number of black-and-white drawings that reveal how cleverly Davis plotted the schematics of his work, and a post-Gloucester oil or two to show that he used motifs from the fishing port long after his close association with the place was over. Certainly Gloucester played a role in his work, as did his other environments, especially New York City, providing a special light, evocative motifs and  particular spaces. Yet as Ms. Wilkin  herself suggests, Davis's art has more to do with his own genius -- his gift for paring line and shape to essences and uniting them with scintillating color -- than with any special place.</p>
        <p>''Stuart Davis in Gloucester'' remains at the National Academy of Design, 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 90th Street, (212) 369-4880, through July 30.</p>
