        <p>A well-known Serbian opposition leader, Vuk Draskovic, was shot and wounded on Thursday night at his home by gunmen, an adviser said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Draskovic was hit twice in the head when attackers fired through a window from his garden, but he was wounded only slightly, said Ognjen Pribicevic, Mr. Draskovic's chief adviser.</p>
        <p>''He was hit in the ear and on the left side of the head,'' Mr. Pribicevic said. He said Mr. Draskovic had been taken to a hospital and was released within three hours.</p>
        <p>As leader of the largest opposition party, the Serbian Renewal Movement, Mr. Draskovic is the most important opponent to President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia. Mr. Draskovic has been leading a campaign for early elections to remove Mr. Milosevic from power. Despite his charisma, he has failed to mobilize much support on the streets in recent months or to unite convincingly with other opposition leaders.</p>
        <p>Last month, the government moved to close his party's television station, Studio B, a sign of its irritation with its presence.</p>
        <p>Mr. Draskovic apparently feared for his safety, and immediately traveled to Montenegro, Serbia's sister republic in the Yugoslav Federation, and asked for protection from President Milo Djukanovic, who leans toward the West.</p>
        <p>''His hands were still shaking,'' said a foreign diplomat who saw Mr. Draskovic shortly after his arrival.</p>
        <p>Mr. Draskovic returned to Belgrade as his supporters rallied to protest the shutdown of Studio B, and he subsequently traveled to Moscow to appeal to Russia, which maintains close ties with Mr. Milosevic.</p>
        <p>Mr. Draskovic has repeatedly accused the government of trying to kill him and has warned that Belgrade is waging a campaign of ''state terrorism'' to maintain its power.</p>
        <p>His party faults Belgrade for an automobile accident in the fall in which Mr. Draskovic's brother-in-law and bodyguards were killed. Mr. Draskovic says that the truck that slammed into the car was intending to kill him and his wife, who were in the same convoy.</p>
        <p>Party officials have also suggested that the government was behind recent high-profile murders in Belgrade, including that of Defense Minister Pavle Bulatovic.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, Mr. Draskovic was watching television alone in his home in a seaside resort, Budva, when the attackers fired at 11:30 p.m., Mr. Pribicevic said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Draskovic thought that there were two attackers who approached through the garden and broke the window glass as they fired, Mr. Pribicevic said. Mr. Draskovic managed to escape to a neighbor's apartment, and he was taken to the hospital.</p>
        <p>From the hospital, he spoke by telephone with his wife, who had remained in Belgrade. He left the hospital for an unknown destination.</p>
