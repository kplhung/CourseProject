        <p>Kobe Bryant was tracked down in a dark corridor at the Conseco Fieldhouse today by an admirer who shared an opinion with the wunderkind guard of the Los Angeles Lakers.</p>
        <p>''You know with that game last night, the way you pulled it out, you crossed the threshold,'' the man said. ''You know that, right?''</p>
        <p>Bryant smiled.</p>
        <p>''I hope you're right,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Whatever invisible barrier exists between the spectacular and the transcendent, Bryant stepped into another world Wednesday night.</p>
        <p>It was not the numbers -- he scored 8 of his 28 points in overtime -- that piggybacked the Lakers to a 120-118 victory over the Indiana Pacers in Game 4.</p>
        <p>It was not the body language, the way he sneered at Reggie Miller on the perimeter before blowing past him to the basket. It was not the way he kept his right wrist cocked in a follow-through motion after dropping in a 23-foot jump shot with 1 minute 20 seconds left in overtime, a pose reminiscent of Michael Jordan's in 1998, when he nailed the coffin shut on the Utah Jazz.</p>
        <p>It was not the sweet reverse layup off a rebound with 5.9 seconds left that demoralized the Pacers. It was in the interview room -- the sweat barely dried and a three-games-to-one lead in the National Basketball Association finals secure -- where Kobe Bryant showed he was 21 going on 40. He understood the moment, carrying the team after Shaquille O'Neal fouled out with 2:33 left in regulation.</p>
        <p>''This is the game I've been dreaming about, to be honest with you,'' Bryant said. ''These are the type of situations I dream about every day. When I was a kid, watching the N.B.A. on TV, I always wanted to be in a game like this, where you can't stop them from scoring and they can't stop you.</p>
        <p>''This is what I wanted to do.''</p>
        <p>When exactly was Kobe Bryant a kid?</p>
        <p>The player who starred in an N.B.A. heirloom in the heartland looked older and sounded much wiser than 21.</p>
        <p>''Awesome,'' Larry Bird said.</p>
        <p>''Kobe was great,'' Phil Jackson said.</p>
        <p>O'Neal was so enraptured with Bryant's performance that he deigned to bestow a nickname on Bryant. ''The Big Little Brother,'' O'Neal said, smiling.</p>
        <p>Jackson has deftly avoided the Jordan comparisons. Of Bryant's performance on Wednesday, the Lakers' coach said: ''I've seen a lot of great ones, but, you know, when you compare the fact that I probably coached, what, 100 games, 110, 115 games with Michael Jordan, I saw a lot of games above or beyond that level from an individual performer. But that's not to take anything away from Kobe.''</p>
        <p>Bryant today led everyone along on the journey -- from the cocksure 18-year-old rookie who fired up air balls against the Jazz in the playoffs to the impetuous, one-on-one All-Star who had trouble co-existing with O'Neal to the consummate star and teammate.</p>
        <p>''He brought the game to me in a different light,'' Bryant said of Jackson. ''It was more kind of relaxing, going with the flow of the game, you know, just investigating the floor really. You penetrate. You know that you can get to that spot, so you say: 'O.K, I know I can get there. I'll come back there later. I might come back there in the fourth quarter.'</p>
        <p>''Little mind games that you play. That's how he approached it with me. He taught me very, very well.''</p>
        <p>Last season, after the Lakers were knocked out in the second round by the San Antonio Spurs, Bryant intimated to several of his former high school teammates that life in L.A. was not all good.</p>
        <p>He and O'Neal were privately feuding -- they engaged in slap fight before last season -- trying to work out the dynamics of their relationship on and off the floor. Worse, observers in and out of the league wondered aloud if Bryant was not more about himself than the Lakers, whether he could ever get out of his one-on-five shoe-commercial mode.</p>
        <p>''I was upset that we kept losing in the playoffs,'' Bryant said. ''I was upset with people talking about my game as far as not being a team player or being great defensively. I just wanted to make a change. I wanted to make it happen. I wanted to prove, you know, that what they were saying was wrong.''</p>
        <p>This season Bryant passed more often, improved his shot selection and slowed the game down in his mind, picking his spots rather than attacking the basket on every possession. Now, he and O'Neal are on the cusp of their first title.</p>
        <p>You have to feel for the other poor souls in Bryant's class at Lower Merion High School outside Philadelphia. At the 10-year reunion, bank presidents and biophysicists will have to compete against a fistful of championship rings, unimaginable wealth and a keen understanding of the world their classmate has attained without setting foot in a university lecture hall.</p>
        <p>''He's planning on getting married this summer at 21,'' Jackson said. ''That seems pretty young in this day and age. Maybe not when I graduated from college. But I think he's mature beyond his years. I think he's handling this very well. I think he's grown a lot in one year. And yet, I see a young man who's still got 13, 14 years of excellent basketball ahead of him.''</p>
        <p>Much has been made about Bryant's decision to get engaged -- as if there some unwritten rule that an N.B.A. player must have 29 girlfriends in 29 cities before settling down -- that the kid can't possibly know what he is doing by committing to a 17-year-old high school senior.</p>
        <p>Maybe he is already an old soul, who needs neither the bar scene nor hotel groupies to validate the continued adolescence that professional sports promotes.</p>
        <p>Hypocritical, no, given how fast we want our young stars to grow up. Whether it is Tiger Woods telling a crude joke or Allen Iverson paying blind homage to his trouble-making friends from the neighborhood, we often malign young athletes for transgressions we made at their age. We give them no grace period to grow up, to learn to be adults before they take over their companies and dominate their chosen professions.</p>
        <p>And yet, here is Bryant, ruining the curve for everyone.</p>
        <p>This is what he did after the most 47 scintillating minutes of his career on Wednesday. Bryant did not celebrate with childhood friends until the wee hours of the morning. He retreated to his hotel room, telephoned his fiancee, Vanessa Laine, his mother, Pam, and father, Joe (Jellybean) Bryant, a former N.B.A. player, elevated his sore ankle that kept him out of Game 3 to reduce the swelling, and fell asleep. No clubs, no parties. Just a responsible employee, readying himself for work the next day.</p>
        <p>When Bryant was 19, cruising through Venice Beach, Calif., in his jet-black BMW, he admitted that he liked the music of the Spice Girls. Now, this could be seen as culture suicide, the end of his hip-hop icon status. But Bryant liked the idea of young kids pushing the limits, and we was not afraid to share that opinion.</p>
        <p>Do you know a single 19-year-old in America who would make such an admission about the Backstreet Boys today?</p>
        <p>Byrant also felt a kinship with Martina Hingis and the Williams sisters, Venus and Serena.</p>
        <p>''They're out there doing the impossible at such a young age,'' he said. ''You can't help but admire that, that they know what they want that young.''</p>
        <p>One of the most conventional thoughts circulating in the league was that Bryant had somehow been coaxed by his management, Adidas marketing teams, into early marriage, that in order to project a cleaner, corporate image like Michael the Infallible, he needed to have the appearance of a family on the horizon.</p>
        <p>Sometimes we reach for things that aren't there. Closer to the truth, Kobe Bryant probably went after the girl he dreamed of marrying with the same passion and zest he went after Game 4. Not everyone needs their 20's to grow up anymore. The kid knows what he wants.</p>
        <p>Now fit him for two rings: one for the wedding and another for the championship.</p>
