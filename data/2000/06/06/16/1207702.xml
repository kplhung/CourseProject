        <p>''Time Regained'' was shown as part of last year's New York Film Festival. Here are excerpts from Janet Maslin's review, which appeared in The New York Times on Sept. 30, 1999. The film opens today in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>If there were a prize for sheer ambition, it would justly go to ''Time Regained.'' The Chilean filmmaker Raul Ruiz has approached that literary Godzilla, Marcel Proust's ''Remembrance of Things Past,'' from the most challenging vantage point possible.</p>
        <p>''Time Regained,'' the epic's seventh and final volume, is the one that recapitulates and resolves all that has come before, and it is Mr. Ruiz's aspiration to synthesize the themes and characters of Proust's monumental work in a single film. In the face of such a daunting prospect, a running time of 158 minutes is really no time at all.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ruiz's propensity for surrealistic touches serves him better than usual in this context. How else to intermingle past and present, to fuse many different impressions of a single character, or to delve with Proustian fortitude beneath the material's genteel veneer? The match of filmmaker and material is felicitous, and its prospects are not diminished by a stellar cast. When the least glamorous Frenchwoman in a film turns out to be Catherine Deneuve (as the matronly Odette, seen mostly in her dowager days), it is at the very least bound to please the eye.</p>
        <p>But ''Time Regained'' struggles under the burden of adapting such rarefied material. Remove most of the impressions, sensations, sighs and longings from ''Remembrance of Things Past,'' and what remains, at least on screen, is a ''Dallas''-load of furtive liaisons and lavish social gatherings. Mr. Ruiz presents this atmosphere with a knowing wink and with a prim little mustachioed Marcel (Marcello Mazzarella) to glide through time and space taking mental notes. But in spite of the film's enterprising efforts to draw the viewer into his realm of enduring, tantalizing relationships, it finds no real way of making the necessary introductions.</p>
        <p>''Time Regained'' whirls from the sickbed of the elderly Marcel to his boyhood and back again, with the characters in his life as the only significant figures in this landscape. They, too, are seen through time, so that Gilberte (Emmanuelle Beart) can be both the little girl who once made a coarse hand gesture that Marcel would never forget, and the fading wife of Robert Saint Loup (Pascal Greggory), who finds her less compelling than his male lovers.</p>
        <p>The dreamy manner in which the film unfolds, with gliding props that suggest one long sleepwalk, fuses all of these impressions together while also rendering them opaque. Difficult as it is to decipher one man's lifetime from his final memories, Theo Angelopoulos's Palme d'Or-winning ''Eternity and a Day'' achieved that sensation with more emotion and less psychic clutter.</p>
        <p>''Time Regained,'' a brave literary adaptation without much resonance outside its literary context, also stars Marie-France Pisier as the giddy, selfish Madame Verdurin, Vincent Perez as the flirtatious Morel and John Malkovich as the decadent Monsieur de Charlus, who casts one of the work's longest shadows.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ruiz's visual wit and playful style are put to good use when the masochistic Charlus visits a male bordello for a beating. The oval-framed hole in the wall through which Marcel enterprisingly peeks into the bedroom is a dandy correlative for the writer's point of view.</p>
