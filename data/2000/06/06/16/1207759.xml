        <p>After five days at his family's compound at Kennebunkport, Me., Gov. George W. Bush returned today to the campaign trail and embarked on a 72-hour,  five-state fund-raising drive that is expected to bring in nearly $5 million for Republicans to wage the fall campaign.</p>

        <p>After five days at his family's compound at Kennebunkport, Me., Gov. George W. Bush returned today to the campaign trail and embarked on a 72-hour,  five-state fund-raising drive that is expected to bring in nearly $5 million for Republicans to wage the fall campaign.</p>
        <p>In his one public campaign event before a round of closed receptions for donors in Maine and Boston, the Texas governor proposed an additional $880 million in federal spending and tax incentives over five years to help disabled Americans with work, public access and new technology.</p>
        <p>''Our goal now is clear -- to speed up the day when our country has removed the last barrier to full independent productive lives for every person with or without disability,'' Mr. Bush said in a 15-minute speech to a small group of people, many in wheelchairs, at Alpha One, a nonprofit organization that provides services to the disabled.</p>
        <p>''All citizens with disabilities ask is a chance to use their own gifts and talent to make their own contribution,'' Mr. Bush said after making a quick tour of the facility.</p>
        <p>The presumptive Republican presidential nominee recalled that his father, the former president, had signed the Americans with Disabilities Act 10 years ago this month.</p>
        <p>The law is designed to provide the disabled with greater opportunities and equal access to services, public facilities and employment.</p>
        <p>The Texas governor then proposed an array of new programs, spending increases and tax incentives, to help the disabled with new technology and public access.</p>
        <p>They included $20 million a year in matching funds to states to guarantee loans so the disabled could buy computers and modems to work at home; a tripling to $33 million of the federal research budget for universities to develop technology; and $10 million in matching funds to help make places of worship more accessible to the disabled.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, who brought in a record $80 million for his presidential primary campaign, spent much of the day raising $1.1 million for the Republicans' autumn offensive, including the kinds of unregulated, unlimited donations that the House has voted to ban. Senate Republicans have consistently blocked the legislation.</p>
        <p>At the Eastland Park Hotel in Portland, Me., Mr. Bush raised an estimated $100,000 for the Maine Republican Party.</p>
        <p>Then he flew to Boston, where he spoke briefly to reporters at Logan International Airport before heading to two events that were to bring in $1 million for the national Republican Party.</p>
        <p>On Friday, Mr. Bush plans to raise another $1.1 million for Republicans in appearances in Ohio and Kentucky and on Saturday in Florida he is to raise $2.75 million for the state and national parties.</p>
        <p>The fund-raising followed Mr. Bush's five-day retreat at his family's Maine compound, where he celebrated his parents' birthdays and made plans, with aides and strategists, for the Republican National Convention, at the end of July in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>Senator John McCain of Arizona, Mr. Bush's main rival in the Republican primaries -- who had put the abolition of big money fund-raising at the center of his campaign -- has agreed to speak on the second night of the convention, said Karen Hughes, Mr. Bush's spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>The night will focus on America's role in the world and is also likely to feature former Republican presidents.</p>
        <p>''We think it's appropriate that a hero and former prisoner of war speak to our convention about the need to rebuild America's military,'' Ms. Hughes said of Mr. McCain.</p>
        <p>Although the second night's most prominent convention slot is usually reserved for a keynote speaker, Mr. McCain had not been offered that role.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's advisers said that historical spot might be done away with. Mr. Bush's aides were planning for retired Gen. Colin L. Powell to speak on the opening night of the convention, Monday, July 31.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, in his Boston news conference, repeated that he wanted to preserve the current Republican platform's plank on abortion, which calls for a ban on the practice, without exception and the appointment of judges who respect ''the sanctity of innocent human life.''</p>
        <p>''We are a pro-life party,'' Mr. Bush said. ''I recognize good people can disagree. We are going to be a pro-life party at the convention.''</p>
