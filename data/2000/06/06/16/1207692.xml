        <p>''Neil Simon's 'Hotel Suite,' '' which opened last night at the Gramercy Theater, couldn't be less hip. That's a not entirely terrible distinction; you watch with a kind of campy amazement at the jelled-in-amber social attitudes, the punch-line jokiness of the dialogue and the well-worn clowning. Besides, the nostalgia of it all might well be the point.</p>
        <p>Presented by the Roundabout Theater as part of its second stage season, the show is, after all, an omnibus, a repackaging of elements from Mr. Simon's previous ''suite'' plays with some rewriting by the playwright. It consists of four hotel room episodes, two from ''California Suite'' (1976) before intermission, and afterward, one each from ''London Suite'' (1995) and ''Plaza Suite'' (1968). (The whole might have been aptly titled ''Suite Suite.'')</p>

        <p>''Neil Simon's 'Hotel Suite,' '' which opened last night at the Gramercy Theater, couldn't be less hip. That's a not entirely terrible distinction; you watch with a kind of campy amazement at the jelled-in-amber social attitudes, the punch-line jokiness of the dialogue and the well-worn clowning. Besides, the nostalgia of it all might well be the point.</p>
        <p>Presented by the Roundabout Theater as part of its second stage season, the show is, after all, an omnibus, a repackaging of elements from Mr. Simon's previous ''suite'' plays with some rewriting by the playwright. It consists of four hotel room episodes, two from ''California Suite'' (1976) before intermission, and afterward, one each from ''London Suite'' (1995) and ''Plaza Suite'' (1968). (The whole might have been aptly titled ''Suite Suite.'')</p>
        <p>The episodes are cleverly paired, two visits each to separate marriages, each pair a showcase of a separate aspect of the playwright's comic predilections; in sum, Neil Simon 101. The first and third reveal Mr. Simon in bittersweet mode, a la ''Lost in Yonkers,'' They focus on an English couple, Diana (Helen Carey) and Sidney (Leigh Lawson), she an accomplished and insecure actress, he an urbane antiques dealer who also happens to be bisexual with a bias toward men.</p>
        <p>In the opening segment, they are in Los Angeles on the night of the Academy Awards, for one of which Diana is a nominee. In two scenes -- before and after the ceremony (she loses, no surprise) -- the play reveals the emotional cost of their incompatible desires. When we see them again in London after intermission, it is years later, and the marriage is dissolved. Diana has become a renowned television star and Sidney is living in Greece with a male lover. Mortality is involved.</p>
        <p>The second and fourth episodes show Mr. Simon's slapstick side, the hyperbolic eccentricities and actions of character exemplified by ''The Odd Couple.'' In them we meet Marvin (Ron Orbach) and Millie (Randy Graff), a Jewish couple from Philadelphia, their marriage twice tested by familial rites of passage.</p>
        <p>In the first, Marvin, in Los Angeles for his nephew's bar mitzvah, awakens in his hotel room next to a hooker, thoughtfully provided by his brother. He doesn't remember any of it, but that's the least of his problems; his wife has just arrived at the hotel and the prostitute, having consumed an entire bottle of vodka, is unrousable. Gymnastic efforts at concealment ensue.</p>
        <p>The marriage lives to fight again, after intermission, on the day their daughter, Mimsey, is to marry. In a fit of prenuptial terror, Mimsey has locked herself in the bathroom of the Plaza Hotel, and her resistance to her parents' pleading, threatening and bellowing is remarkably durable. By the time her fiance lures her to her fate with the terse eloquence of youth -- ''Chill out,'' he says -- both her parents are injured and soaking wet, their formal clothes tattered and askew.</p>
        <p>The show is given a snappy staging by John Tillinger, who directed the revival of Mr. Simon's ''Sunshine Boys'' on Broadway three seasons ago; the sets, by James Noone, are brightly suggestive of the different styles of the three cities' hotels (the only unrealistic taint is that the suites seem awfully compact, a function of the theater's diminutive stage), and the actors are uniformly deft at fulfilling their assigned types. (This includes Amanda Serkasevich in a variety of small parts, including the passed-out hooker, to which she brings new and very funny meaning to the phrase ''dead weight.'') In particular, Mr. Orbach, a bulky actor, provides a skillful bluster that owes much to Jackie Gleason, and Ms. Carey is a marvelously nuanced drunk; her body language slurs, just noticeably, with her spoken language.</p>
        <p>But the show nonetheless feels oddly out of time. Mr. Simon is, of course, one of our most prolific and durable playwrights. But with a comic sensibility born in another era (recall the young marrieds of ''Barefoot in the Park''), he has, for the past decade or so, struggled to accommodate a more contemporary sense of social intercourse. Shows like ''Jake's Women,'' the musical version of ''The Goodbye Girl,'' and even the 1950's comedy ''Laughter on the 23rd Floor,'' all of which had Mr. Simon's signature quickness of wit, nonetheless suffered from a humor whose time had passed.</p>
        <p>''Hotel Suite'' seems to revel in this retrograde quality, almost defiantly. Mr. Tillinger appears to acknowledge this by having the scene changes performed by a perky ensemble of very young actors dressed as bellmen and chambermaids, who engage in sexy horseplay as they move the furniture around. But what are we to make of a woman who vows to avenge her husband's infidelity by taking his credit card and threatening to spend all his money? (Quite aside from the implied gender politics, it was a hackneyed joke when Mr. Simon wrote it more than three decades ago.)</p>
        <p>More discomforting are the episodes dealing with homosexuality. Not that Mr. Simon is unsympathetic to the societal prejudice aimed at gay people, or AIDS victims, which is raised timidly here; he's rather witty on the frustrations facing Diana and Sidney and compassionate toward their hardships, too. But there's something adult-educationish in the writing, which has the knee-jerk liberal tone of a white man writing about blacks, explaining people like ''them'' to people like ''us.''</p>
        <p>At one point in the show, Ms. Carey's Diana, as a late-career success in television, defends her abandonment of the theater this way: ''Our theater doesn't exist any more. They're all revivals, and then they revive the revivals.'' Perhaps inadvertently, ''Hotel Suite'' echoes the resignation of this remark. Mr. Simon's work is worthy of a retrospective, but this one feels like a self-delivered testimonial.</p>
