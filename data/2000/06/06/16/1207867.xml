        <p>HUANG-John. It is with great sorrow that we mourn the loss of our dear friend and colleague, John Huang. John was a credit to both the medical profession and the legal profession. His insight and analytical skills will sorely be missed. Most cherished of all, however, was his friendship and loyalty and it is in that regard that we are left with a void that will be filled with memories. In all facets of life, he has left an indelible mark. His legacy will surely live on in the hearts of those he touched and in his caring and devoted wife Mabel and two sons, Michael and David, of whom he was tremendously proud. We were honored to have spent this time with you and our prayers go out to you and your family until we meet again. Roy F. Scaffidi, Esq.</p>
