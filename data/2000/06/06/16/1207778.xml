        <p>In the legal equivalent of a bench-clearing brawl, closing arguments in the tax-fraud trial of Albert J. Pirro Jr. ended chaotically this afternoon after the prosecution suggested that Mr. Pirro lusted for money in much the way it said President Richard M. Nixon had lusted for power.</p>
        <p>Angry defense lawyers immediately moved for a mistrial, saying that the analogy was an unfair insinuation of bribery and obstruction of justice, and that the mere mention of Mr. Nixon's name would ''pollute the environment'' of the trial.</p>

        <p>In the legal equivalent of a bench-clearing brawl, closing arguments in the tax-fraud trial of Albert J. Pirro Jr. ended chaotically this afternoon after the prosecution suggested that Mr. Pirro lusted for money in much the way it said President Richard M. Nixon had lusted for power.</p>
        <p>Angry defense lawyers immediately moved for a mistrial, saying that the analogy was an unfair insinuation of bribery and obstruction of justice, and that the mere mention of Mr. Nixon's name would ''pollute the environment'' of the trial.</p>
        <p>Until that point, the summations had proceeded smoothly, with each side trying to buttress its arguments and poke holes in the other's. But when Cathy Seibel, an assistant United States attorney, wrapped up her rebuttal summation by describing Mr. Nixon and Mr. Pirro as ''smart people'' who ''keep very damaging information around,'' the ordinary turned into the extraordinary.</p>
        <p>First, the Nixon analogy elicited protest and looks of disbelief from lawyers for Mr. Pirro, a real estate lawyer and Republican lobbyist. He and his brother and accountant, Anthony G. Pirro, are accused of improperly deducting more than $1.2 million in personal expenses as business write-offs in order to avoid more than $400,000 in taxes. Then, with the jury out of the courtroom, the two sides rushed to spar before Judge Barrington D. Parker Jr., nattering in tones that could often be heard in the back of the gallery.</p>
        <p>''I think it's so venomous, I think it's so vicious that I move for mistrial,'' said an enraged Gustave H. Newman, Albert Pirro's lead lawyer. ''I usually don't lose it in a case, but I lost it in this case. In 45 years, I've never seen anything like that. It's despicable.''</p>
        <p>The squabbling threw the trial into turmoil, prompting Judge Parker to schedule another special meeting for Monday at 9 a.m. to consider the mistrial motion.</p>
        <p>The four-week-old trial has already offered more than its share of drama and surprises, usually away from the jury, either in conferences with the judge or outside the Federal District Courthouse here.</p>
        <p>If Judge Parker does not declare a mistrial -- and some lawyers who observed today's proceeding predicted he would not -- then he will proceed to instruct jurors on the 61-count indictment later Monday morning, with deliberations to follow. Many lawyers believe that if either Pirro brother is convicted, the defense will almost certainly appeal.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, Ms. Seibel began the round of summations by calling Albert Pirro, the husband of Jeanine F. Pirro, the Westchester County district attorney, an arrogant ''crook'' with ''chutzpah'' who greedily subsidized his lavish expenses on cars, art and vacations with taxpayer money. She was followed by Mr. Newman, who said that Mr. Pirro may have made some minor errors on his tax returns, but had nothing to hide.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Newman said that far from being a crook, Albert Pirro had tried to ''do the right thing'' by cooperating with the Internal Revenue Service and repaying the government about $1 million in back taxes and interest. And he said that about 95 percent of the deductions and 99 percent of the income made by Mr. Pirro's companies were uncontested in the case.</p>
        <p>''Like the old Ivory soap commercial, he's 99.9 percent pure,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Newman may have been off a tad, since the correct figure for the soap is 99.44 percent. But had he known that, he would no doubt have used that small error to reinforce the argument that people make mistakes, and when people who do make mistakes try to make amends -- as Albert Pirro did -- they should be commended, not indicted.</p>
        <p>Mr. Newman was followed by Roger L. Stavis, the lawyer for Anthony Pirro, whose name has been mentioned less frequently than Jeanine Pirro's during the trial. In his summation, Mr. Stavis repeated his contention that his client was simply doing his job as an accountant and that he was not some ''Svengali'' who had conspired with his older brother.</p>
        <p>Then it was time again for Ms. Seibel to conclude matters. First, she commended Mr. Newman for his eloquence and Mr. Stavis for his stentorian style. But she contended that she had one thing that they did not: ''overwhelming evidence.'' She scoffed at the defense's argument that Albert Pirro should not be punished because he paid back taxes.</p>
        <p>But it was the final part of her summation that most riled Albert Pirro's lawyers. She likened what she called Mr. Pirro's orchestration of criminal activities and efforts to turn over incomplete records, when subpoenaed by the government, to the actions taken by Mr. Nixon during the Watergate scandal.</p>
        <p>''In Nixon's case, it was power that drove him,'' she said. ''In this case, it was money that drove Albert Pirro.''</p>
