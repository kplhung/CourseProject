        <p>''You look pretty,'' the little girl said as my yellow kayak glided past. At first -- tired, sweaty, sunburned -- I thought I hadn't heard right.</p>
        <p>''Excuse me? What did she say?'' I called out to the man and woman with her, probably her parents. On this sunny Sunday they basked lazily in their backyard, which looked out onto the narrow canal connecting the two largest Finger Lakes.</p>
        <p>This slender waterway was the focus of my first-ever solo kayaking and camping trip. Before I left, worrisome thoughts nagged. Will my arms hold out for 12 miles of paddling in one day? Is going through a lock dangerous in a kayak? Will it get dark before I reach camp? Will I be safe?</p>
        <p>Now, however, with five hours of paddling and all three of the day's locks behind me, with plenty of daylight left and only a few miles to go, I had worked myself into empty-minded calm. The Cayuga-Seneca Canal, which connects those two Finger Lakes to the Erie Canal, does not run wide, deep or fast. Its loose curves parallel the main road that runs through historic Waterloo and Seneca Falls. I could have had lunch at McDonald's if I'd wanted to.</p>
        <p>And I was feeling strong. With the scenery a relatively mild succession of backyards and marshes interspersed only briefly with looming buildings from the Industrial Revolution, I had had plenty of time to practice every stroke tip I had ever received.</p>
        <p>By this point I was twisting smoothly from side to side with gentle, nearly silent paddle sweeps, a peculiar motion that felt powerful and effortless. It was then that I heard the little girl's call.</p>
        <p>''She said, 'You look pretty,' '' the man repeated. I was amused and flattered. And there was also pride, to seem pretty to a little girl in this context -- not in dress or looks, but in motion, independence and strength. ''Well, thank you,'' I said to the girl. ''You look pretty, too.''</p>
        <p>It was one of many highlights of this trip, the first I had ever planned exclusively by my 39-year-old self. When it turned out none of my friends could join me, I decided it was time to come of age.</p>
        <p>Camping was what my family did for vacations, but my responsibilities had been minimal. As an adult, I'd camped and kayaked, but always with friends who were in charge.</p>
        <p>I was drawn by the history of New York's canal system, a 19th-century accomplishment of brute force that created transportation for people and goods. The Erie Canal, opened in 1825 by Gov. DeWitt Clinton, underlies both the nation's great population expansion westward and the prominence of the port of New York. But today it is the preserve of fishermen and pleasure boaters.</p>
        <p>Almost adolescent excitement simmered while I pored over maps,  coming up with this plan. Day 1: Leave food, camping gear and a bicycle at the Cayuga Lake State Park, then drive the 12 miles west to Seneca Lake State Park and get started. (The kayak, a borrowed yellow plastic sit-on-top model -- distinct from  the more sophisticated covered shell variety into which the paddler's legs slide -- was light enough for me to get it on and off the car by myself.) Paddle the canal back to Cayuga Lake, passing through Locks 4, 3 and 2, dropping a total of 65 feet in elevation. Camp.</p>
        <p>Day 2: Paddle up the lake to Lock 1 and through a 7,000-acre wildlife refuge, to the Erie Canal. Then back to camp. Ride the bike to Cayuga to get the car, and return for a last night of camping.</p>
        <p>And that's basically how it worked. On Morning 1, I was in the water just after 10 a.m., maneuvering out of the quiet marina and into the canal, which turned out to be 30 yards across at its widest, with the bottom almost always visible. Marshy areas teemed with red-wing blackbirds. A startled great blue heron lifted off, its long legs dangling, its vast wings beating slowly.</p>
        <p>With my polarized sunglasses, I could see past the water's gleaming surface, and was astonished to spot giant fish, three feet long, clustered by a drainage pipe. A fisherman said they were carp. Later, I stared at a red-tailed hawk circling overhead.</p>
        <p>The first lock, No. 4, was five miles into the trip, at Waterloo, where the canal's elevation drops 14.5 feet. It is a giant doorway framed in 30-foot-tall blue girders, its gates -- vast, incredibly strong cabinet doors -- rising perhaps a third of the way up. The kayak nosed up to the red stoplight at the lock's right just after noon, and a big chunk of my nervousness evaporated. I'd been going 2.5 miles an hour -- so the day's paddling could be over by midafternoon.</p>
        <p>Three blasts from the tiny whistle hanging from my neck was supposed to mean Open Sesame to the lockkeeper. But from the vantage point of a kayak, floating insignificantly in front of this miracle of engineering, it just seemed ridiculous, like blowing a whistle at a 747. Passers-by stopped to look inside the lock's basin, and it seemed likely that they were watching it fill, so I simply waited. After a while, the tops of two pleasure cruisers began to emerge over the gate. A few more minutes, and, with a buzzing mechanical hum, the gates slowly opened. The pleasure cruisers motored out.</p>
        <p>The light turned green, and I headed in, calling to the lockkeeper: ''I've never been through a lock before. What do I do?''</p>
        <p>''Just grab on and hand yourself down,'' he said. I took hold of one of the thick ropes hanging along the lock's walls, and the gates, humming again, closed. A new drone began, along with the sound of a great rush of water. I felt like a first-time flier on takeoff.</p>
        <p>The water dropped at perhaps two feet a minute. Soon I was at the bottom of a giant cement tank. It was cold. Then the gates in front of me opened, and I paddled out, a rare and amusing sight to a cluster of fishermen trying their luck on the lock's other side. ''What do you call one of those?'' one even asked.</p>
        <p>Two more locks that day, and another lock twice the next -- and I never did blow that whistle.</p>
        <p>I made it to home base, but two hours later than I'd projected. My maps marked Cayuga Lake State Park, but not exactly. It turned out to be another mile down the lake, which I made even longer by following the shoreline's meandering edge. Still, I had enough daylight and energy to set up camp, have an instant noodle-soup dinner and bike 10 minutes to town for some missing provisions (beer and chips). Praising the inventor of the air mattress, I passed out in my tent around 10 p.m.</p>
        <p>Wildlife took over the second day. First, I tried to figure out what was making the desperate splashing that burst out over and over along the lake's reedy edges. Clumsy muskrats? But it was the carp again, in pairs, thrashing around in the warm shallow water in behavior so weird it just had to be mating.</p>
        <p>A young osprey stood proudly in its high matted nest by Lock 1, where the lockkeeper told of finding deer swimming in the lock basin many a morning.</p>
        <p>The canal runs through the Montezuma National Wildlife Refuge, where at least a dozen great blue herons flapped across my line of vision. Little martins swooped around, vacuuming up insects. A drainage pipe from the refuge's vast duck pond attracted a roiling shoal of hundreds of carp, which were  turning out to be the trip's theme fish. Binoculars helped me pick out the profile of what could have been a mink, beaver or marten peeking at me over tall grass 100 feet ahead. As I drifted closer, it scuttled off.</p>
        <p>Nature simmered away so entrancingly, and the canal's current carried me so effortlessly, that the day turned dreamlike. But when I landed for a brief lunch at a meadow and had to pull the kayak up on the bank, the deep fatigue in my back muscles reawakened me. And I'd have to fight the current -- and a light but noticeable headwind -- on my return. So I resolved to turn around when I reached the Erie Canal, a mile ahead.</p>
        <p>And the best sighting of all came after I had done so, laboring upstream and against the wind for the final leg of my voyage of independence. A small dark lump slid across the water, emerging to leaped into the underbrush. Something seemed to be dangling from its mouth. Instead of disappearing, it darted ahead, in and out of the brush along the shore. I paddled quickly past, then turned around. Just 10 feet away, a ferretlike creature crouched motionless on the bank. Its fur was brown, tipped in black. Its eyes, trained directly on me, were big, round and brown. It had four inches of silver fish dangling out of its mouth.</p>
        <p>It was so primal, so much in its place, so complete. A river otter, I later found out. It flipped around and dashed off. And I paddled back to camp, dreamy again and deeply content, thinking how pretty it was.</p>
        <p>Brave the Locks</p>
        <p>The New York Canal Authority, (800) 4CANAL4, sends out maps and brochures, including the locations, hours and phone numbers of all 57 of the system's locks, as well as instructions about how to maneuver safely through the state's 524 miles of canals.</p>
        <p>Cayuga Lake State Park, (315) 568-5163, has a boat launch and 286 campsites, most with no electricity. They cost $13 a night for nonelectric sites and $15 for those with electricity. Reserve by calling Reserve America, (800) 456-CAMP, or visiting www.ReserveAmerica.com.</p>
        <p>Seneca Lake State Park, Geneva, N.Y., (315) 789-2331, is open dawn till dark. It is about 275 miles from New York City. Take Interstate 80 west through New Jersey, then, in Pennsylvania, 380 north to Scranton, and 81 north to 20 west, to Geneva.</p>
