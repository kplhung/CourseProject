        <p>Personal wealth and power do not necessarily correspond on Capitol Hill, with some of the leading members of Congress holding few assets and avoiding the booming stock market.</p>
        <p>Others, however, took the plunge.</p>
        <p>Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader and a former college professor, has no assets beyond a checking account. He supplements his income of $151,800 with an annual teacher's pension of less than $2,500, according to House personal financial disclosures released today. (Other lower-ranking members make an annual salary of $136,700.)</p>
        <p>The speaker of the House, Representative J. Dennis Hastert, earned a salary of $175,400 for 1999. He reported assets from investments and real estate, but also had considerable liabilities. Mr. Hastert listed property, including a 270-acre farm in Shipman, Ill., a town house in Washington and an opera house in Plainfield, Ill. The building, which he now rents out, once housed a theater and his father's restaurant. Mr. Hastert valued the farm and opera house at $100,001 to $250,000; rental income from the farm and opera house, he said, was $15,001 to $50,000 each.</p>
        <p>He is paying mortgages on the property. He also signed loans for home repair and co-signed several loans with family members.</p>
        <p>The House minority leader, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, reported a mutual fund worth $15,001 to $50,000, with several other investments of less than $15,000. But the cost of education countered his assets. Mr. Gephardt, who earned $151,800 in salary, owed $50,001 to $100,000 on one student loan, and $15,001 to $50,000 on another. He also borrowed $15,001 to $50,000 on his life insurance policy.</p>
        <p>Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip and the House's third-ranking Republican, valued his Exxon stock at $50,001 to $100,000 and reported a bank account of $1,001 to $15,000. He has no significant debt.</p>
        <p>Since the late 1970's, members of Congress have been required each year to file broad financial disclosure reports intended to reveal that they do not have holdings that might pose a conflict of interest. The rules permit the members to provide a rough snapshot of their assets and debts.</p>
        <p>From the other side of the Capitol, Senator Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey, was active in the market last year, buying and selling technology stocks. He made more than 100 transactions last year, sometimes buying and selling stocks on the same day.</p>
        <p>Senator Torricelli's stock holdings were valued from $260,000 to $775,000, for technology companies like Amazon.com.</p>
        <p>Last summer, Mr. Torricelli bought $1,001 to $15,000 worth of the DrKoop.com stock on Aug. 5 and sold it the same day. He listed a purchase of the same amount of Novell stock on Aug. 10 and sold it the next day. And on Aug. 11, Mr. Torricelli bought $15,001 to $50,000 worth of AmeriTrade stock and sold it on Aug. 13.</p>
        <p>Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, reported $250,000 from the Heinz family foundation for the 1998 Heinz Award in Public Policy. Mr. Moynihan, who is retiring, received a special exemption from the Senate Ethics Committee allowing him to accept a gift worth $50 or more.</p>
        <p>Senator Chuck Hagel, a Republican from Nebraska who is a former investment banker, reported assets of $1 million to $5 million and $500,000 to $1 million in two Merrill Lynch accounts. He also listed $100,001 to $250,000 in a Longview Capital fund.</p>
        <p>Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, Democrat of West Virginia, reported three blind trusts worth more than $80 million.</p>
        <p>Senator Peter G. Fitzgerald, Republican of Illinois, listed Bank of Montreal stock that he inherited from his father.</p>
        <p>Not all members of the Senate were drawn to the stock market. Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, reported two credit union accounts of less than $1,000, and at least $15,000 of debt owed to Mastercard.</p>
        <p>And Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, held a Senate credit union savings account of $1,001 to $15,000 and property in his home state worth $200,001 to $500,000.</p>
