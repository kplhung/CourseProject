        <p>Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman has ordered new health standards for the ground beef that the federal government buys for the school lunch program.</p>
        <p>For the first time, department officials said, the government will require testing for disease-causing bacteria and set limits for permissible levels. McDonald's and other large fast-food companies already impose similar standards.</p>
        <p>Several consumer groups called attention to the lack of government bacteria standards after one former school lunch provider, Supreme Beef Processors of Dallas, won a court ruling that allowed it to stay open despite failing several Agriculture Department inspections since April 1999. The department announced this week that the plant had failed a fourth inspection.</p>
        <p>Under new regulations that use scientific testing at meat processing plants, the Agriculture Department should have been able to withhold inspection service, tantamount to suspending operations at a meat plant, from Supreme Beef when it failed its third inspection for salmonella contamination. But a permanent injunction prevents the department from suspending inspection services on the basis of the failed salmonella tests.</p>
        <p>The order applies to ground beef in the Northern District of Texas.</p>
