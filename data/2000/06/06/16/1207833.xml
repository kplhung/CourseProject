        <p>It's an old story, of course, wedged out of a typical American landscape: a bunch of uniformed baseball players, standing, hats off, faces toward the Stars and Stripes flying from the center-field flag pole in a pretty little small-town ballpark on a sweet spring night.</p>

        <p>It's an old story, of course, wedged out of a typical American landscape: a bunch of uniformed baseball players, standing, hats off, faces toward the Stars and Stripes flying from the center-field flag pole in a pretty little small-town ballpark on a sweet spring night.</p>
        <p>And in typical fashion before the start of the game, these players, as well as some 3,000 fans in the stands in Dodd Stadium in Norwich, Conn., listened to the national anthem, sung over the public-address system by the earnest Mystic Middle School choir. Typical perhaps for most of the people there, but hardly prosaic for the pitcher, cap on heart, standing on the mound, the escapee.</p>
        <p>''I felt very emotional,'' he said through a translator after the game, which took place eight days ago. ''I mean no disrespect to America -- which I am grateful for -- but I wish I could have heard the Cuban national anthem, too. I was a little bit sad for that.''</p>
        <p>Looking closer at the pitcher, one could have sworn he had seen him before, on the mound in Yankee Stadium. There were the now-familiar navy blue stirrups exposed almost to the knees, the bill of the navy blue baseball cap curved nearly like a view-finder. And when he pitched, one may have convinced himself that this was, yes, El Duque, Orlando Hernandez, the Cuban defector and Yankee ace:</p>
        <p>Right-handed, cups his glove up to his nose when getting the sign from the catcher, throws from numerous angles, throws a wide assortment of breaking pitches, mixes speeds and has that high, peekaboo kick in his motion which, at the last moment, gives a sudden jerk, as though he has been bitten by a bee in the buttock.</p>
        <p>But peering closer, one notices that he is somewhat smaller than El Duque and younger, rather boyish looking. He doesn't throw quite as hard, though he can whistle the ball 89 or 90 miles an hour. And his uniform blouse reads ''Navigators,'' the team from Norwich, the Yankees' Class AA affiliate. And the opponents on June 8 were not, say, the Red Sox, but the New Britain Rock Cats.</p>
        <p>This is Adrian Hernandez, who is being widely referred to as El Duquecito -- Little El Duque -- and it is hardly a secret that he idolized and assiduously modeled his pitching style after the Yankees' Hernandez. They are not related, though they were friends and played together on the Havana Industriales, a high-level team in Cuba.</p>
        <p>And two weeks ago, in his first start in organized baseball, it seemed Adrian Hernandez was a more impressive clone even than Dolly the Sheep. Pitching for Tampa, the Yankees' Class A team in the Florida State League, he struck out 13 batters in six and two-thirds innings, giving up just one run on three hits and walking one.</p>
        <p>George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, and some members of the Yankee brass watched the game. They saw enough: move him to the next level. Which is Norwich.</p>
        <p>''He's an experienced pitcher for his age -- he's 25,'' Billy Connors, the Yankees' vice president for player personnel and their traveling pitching adviser, said before the night game. ''Got a lot of moxie out there. And if he does as well tonight as he did in Tampa last week, it's possible he could move up quickly again.'' To Columbus, the Class AAA affiliate? ''Yes,'' Connors said. ''And yes, it's possible you could see Adrian pitching in Yankee Stadium before the end of the season.''</p>
        <p>Connors also cautioned that Adrian is not completely the second El Duque. At age 25, and 6 feet 1 inch and 190 pounds, he is about 10 years younger and not as experienced as the 6-2, 190-pound Orlando Hernandez was, having been one of Cuba's winningest pitchers. Both their stories had the stuff of drama, however.</p>
        <p>El Duque stealthily made his way out of Cuba on a raft in December 1997. Adrian, last Jan. 2, boarded a plane in Havana and either used a forged visa to get on the aircraft as himself, or disguised himself as a woman. He dismisses the latter, but won't confirm the former. ''I don't want to talk about that now,'' he said. The fact is, the plane flew to Costa Rica and hooked up with an agent, who contacted the Yankees. When Orlando Hernandez heard about it, he recommended Adrian to them.</p>
        <p>The Yankees looked Adrian Hernandez over, worked him out in their training complex in Tampa, saw he had ability and brains, was a hard worker and kept himself in superb shape, and signed him to a four-year, $4 million contract.</p>
        <p>In Norwich now, leading off for the Rock Cats was Cleatus Davidson, the shortstop, batting left-handed. Hernandez kicked, fired a pitch sidearm and Davidson lined it to right-center- field for a triple.</p>
        <p>''Adrian has to be convinced that throwing sidearm to left-handed batters is dangerous,'' Connors said, watching from the press box. ''Gotta come more over the top. I told him. He'll learn.''</p>
        <p>The next batter bounced out to short, the run scoring. Hernandez struck out the next hitter and retired the fourth on an infield grounder. In the second, three up, three down. Looked dominating. In the third, though, after two outs, storm clouds: he walked three straight batters, then got a fly ball for an out. In the fourth inning, he walked the first batter. Got a double play and a strikeout. Still strong. Could he almost smell the kosher hot dogs at Yankee Stadium?</p>
        <p>And around about the fifth inning, he recalled, he looked up at a sky box and saw none other than El Duque himself, in white baseball cap and short-sleeve shirt. ''I felt proud that Orly'' -- the name he calls Orlando -- ''would come all the way from New York to see me pitch,'' Hernandez said. Maybe it was a loss of concentration, or nervousness, but he then ran into trouble: two hits, two walks, two runs. In the sixth, after Hernandez walked the first batter, the Norwich manager, Dan Radison, removed him, with the score 6-3.</p>
        <p>The final line: five innings, four hits, four runs (three earned), eight strikeouts, seven walks, one wild pitch, one balk. Winning pitcher: Hernandez.</p>
        <p>''It's a lot of walks,'' Connors said after the game, ''but he was always around the plate.''</p>
        <p>Tom Filer, the Norwich pitching coach, said, ''And when he wants to, he can reach back and pop the ball.''</p>
        <p>Hernandez's second outing -- against the New Haven Mariners on Tuesday night -- wasn't nearly as successful. He gave up six runs in just two innings, and clearly struggled with his control again, walking four batters and hitting two others.</p>
        <p>''I told him it's not the end of the world,'' Connors told The New Haven Register. ''Sometimes this is the best thing that can happen because everything had been going so good. Now he knows he has to pitch ahead in the count and throw strikes.''</p>
        <p>About his performance that night, Adrian said the umpire's strike zone was ''tinier'' than he had experienced before, a problem that no doubt plagued him in his second outing with Norwich on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>After Tuesday night's outing, there may be some tossing and turning. Still, he's here and he's pitching for the Yankee organization, and he's entitled to dream.</p>
