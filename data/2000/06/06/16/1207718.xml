        <p>American diplomats met with Israeli military officials today to reiterate their objections to the sale of an airborne radar system to China, participants in the talks said.</p>
        <p>The Americans also pressed for consultations before Israel offers advanced weapons to other countries ''of concern'' to the United States.</p>
        <p>Some Israeli officials reacted testily to the request, fearing that the United States was in effect asking for veto power over Israel's arm sales. And some of the American officials appeared exasperated by what they see as Israeli unwillingness to acknowledge growing concern about tension in the Taiwan Strait and about the potential exposure of United States forces there.</p>
        <p>But diplomats from both sides said they welcomed the effort to tamp down a simmering dispute that has prompted one key Congressman to threaten to cut military aid here.</p>
        <p>''We are both trying to find a way to resolve a disagreement, though our view still is that they should cancel the sale,'' a State Department official said after the meetings.</p>
        <p>The American delegation presented a list of 27 ''countries of concern,'' including China and India, another important Israeli arms client, where Washington wants formal consultations before Israel negotiates arms sales, even if the weapons do not incorporate United States technology.</p>
        <p>The increasing technical sophistication of Israel's homegrown defense systems prompted this unusual request, United States officials said. ''This is a special relationship, with special obligations on both sides,'' an American official said.</p>
        <p>The American delegation was headed by Eric Newsome, director of the State Department's political and military affairs, and included  several high-ranking Pentagon officials and Martin Indyk, the American ambassador to Israel. Amos Yaron, the Defense Ministry's director general, led the Israeli side.</p>
        <p>So far, Israel has resisted the intensifying pressure to rescind the agreement to supply China with the $250 million worth of an early-warning radar and communications system. Mounted in a refurbished Ilyushin-76 transport parked on the periphery of Tel Aviv's Ben-Gurion International Airport, the airborne surveillance center is just weeks away from its final test flights, officials close to the project said.</p>
        <p>Sonny Callahan, an Alabama Republican who heads the House subcommittee that oversees foreign aid appropriations, vowed earlier this week to slice $250 million from next year's $1.92 billion military package for Israel if the sale is concluded.</p>
        <p>He said he would drop his objection if Defense Secretary William S. Cohen testifies that the sale would not jeopardize national security. That is a difficult proposition for Mr. Cohen, who forcefully stated in recent visits to Israel that the radar system would greatly heighten the risks faced by United States forces in Asia.</p>
