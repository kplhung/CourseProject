        <p>Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy opera, classical music and dance events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region.</p>
        <p>Opera</p>
        <p>''CARMEN.'' The first production of the Opera Festival of New Jersey is Bizet's ''Carmen,'' one of the most popular operas ever written. But this inventive company, which performs only in the summer at the McCarter Theater on the campus of Princeton University, has more unusual productions lined up for later in the season, including Hugo Weisgall's ''Six Characters in Search of an Author'' and Princeton native Frank Lewin's ''Burning Bright.'' Verdi's ''Falstaff'' rounds out the season. ''Carmen'' will feature Suzanna Guzman in the title role, Gerald Powers as Don Jose and Kristopher Irmiter as Escamillo. Michael Ching conducts and Elizabeth Bachman, in her festival debut, is the stage director. Tomorrow's performance at 8 p.m. is the opening night gala. The gala dinner beforehand costs $150 per person. But the post-performance festivities in the theater lobby are free to all; cocktails are at 5 p.m., dinner at 6. McCarter Theater, Princeton University, 91 University Place, Princeton, N.J. Tickets: $24-$82. For tickets, information and directions, call: (609) 258-2787; gala information, (609) 279-1750 (Anthony Tommasini).</p>

        <p>''MARRIAGE OF FIGARO.'' The homespun but attractive qualities of the Amato Opera's productions and the intimacy of its shoe-box theater offer a useful change of perspective for operagoers used to the big houses uptown. The casts here vary: the singers are eager and enthusiastic, and sometimes promising, and Anthony Amato, the company's founder, conducts the performances with an evident love of the music. The performances this weekend close the season, and tomorrow evening's show will also include a celebration of Mr. Amato's 80th birthday. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Sunday at 2:30 p.m. Amato Opera Theater, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village. Tickets: tomorrow evening's performance is $50; the Sunday performance is $25; $20 for the elderly and children; (212) 228-8200 (Allan Kozinn).</p>
        <p>''RIGOLETTO'' and ''MADAMA BUTTERFLY.'' This summer marks the 34th consecutive year of the Met in the Parks, the Metropolitan Opera's popular and free series of operas in concert performance. Verdi's ''Rigoletto'' opened on Tuesday in Central Park with a fine cast, headed by Carlo Guelfi in the title role. An alternate cast will sing tonight's performance in Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx: Frederick Burchinal as Rigoletto, Jonathan Welch as the Duke of Mantua and Jennifer Welch as Gilda. Nello Santi conducts. Tomorrow night in Van Cortland Park in the Bronx, a highly-touted Hungarian soprano, Georgina Lukacs, in her first appearance with the Met, will sing the title role of ''Madama Butterfly,'' with Paul Charles Clarke as the callow American naval lieutenant B. F. Pinkerton. Julius Rudel will conduct. ''Rigoletto: Pelham Bay Park, Bronx; today at 8 p.m. ''Madama Butterfly: Van Cortland Park, Bronx; tomorrow at 8 p.m. Performances are free; information, (212) 362-6000 (Tommasini).</p>
        <p>Classical Music</p>
        <p>BARGEMUSIC. There are few better places in the city to hear chamber music than this barge floating on the East River, with its live, intimate acoustics and its spectacular view of Lower Manhattan. Good weather will only enhance the experience, and the performances are often as fine as the setting. Here, in programs coordinated by Toby Hoffman, a violist, he is joined by other performers, including Peter Nagy, a pianist, and Colin Carr, a cellist. The big piece tonight and tomorrow is Brahms's G minor Piano Quartet (the one Schoenberg gussied up for orchestra); on Sunday, it is Schubert's ''Trout'' Quintet. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, and Sunday at 4 p.m., Bargemusic, Fulton Ferry Landing under the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-4061. Tickets: $27; $25 for the elderly; $15 for students (James R. Oestreich).</p>
        <p>GOLDMAN MEMORIAL BAND. Outdoor concerts by concert bands can be a hard sell these days: the repertory generally has an olden quality, marches and galops not being especially in vogue now, and the amplification that is usually necessary to help these groups compete with traffic exact a cost on whatever subtlety the playing may show. Still, the Goldman Memorial Band, which traces its roots to 1911, tends to draw fairly large crowds to its free summer performances. Its program this weekend is to be conducted by David Eaton and includes the premiere of ''The New York Times Color March,'' a work by Carl Schlesinger, a retired printer at The New York Times who wanted to commemorate the newspaper's introduction of color photographs, illustrations and advertisements in 1997. Also on the program is a tribute to the Manhattan School of Music, with works by John Corigliano, Vittorio Giannini and a commissioned work by Drew Hemenger, a doctoral candidate at the school. Sunday: 6 p.m. at Damrosch Park at Lincoln Center (212) 807-4915. Admission is free. (Kozinn).</p>
        <p>MANNES BACH INSTITUTE. It is nice to see that the blockbuster commemorations of the 250th anniversary of Bach's death this year have not entirely crowded out more intimate affairs. The Mannes College of Music here concludes a two-week institute on Bach performance, which has included concerts by faculty members and students. Appropriately, the final event is devoted to the students newly groomed, offering selected arias as well as works featuring cello, flute and other instruments. Tonight at 8, Mannes Concert Hall, 150 West 85th Street, Manhattan, (212) 580-0210, ext 277. Admission: free (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>MAVERICK CONCERTS. This enterprising chamber music series, in its 85th season, offers concerts in an open-sided barn where the sounds of nature and the music of man interact freely. It is opening its season with what it calls a Prelude Concert, with performances by Steven Lubin, the pianist, and Danielle Woerner, the soprano. Also on the program is Mary Louise Wilson's play, ''There's a Deer in My Soup,'' and a community sing with the Ars Coralis choir. Saturday at 5 p.m. Maverick Road between Routes 28 and 375, West Hurley, N.Y., just outside Woodstock. (914) 679-8217 Tickets: $15. (Kozinn).</p>
        <p>Dance</p>
        <p>AMERICAN BALLET THEATER. Martine van Hamel returns to the company as Madge the witch in ''La Sylphide'' tomorrow night, preceded by Robert Joffrey's ''Pas de Deesses.''

Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $20 to $75. Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center; (212) 362-6000 Matinee-goers can brush up on their Bournonville at ''ABTalks,'' a free pre-performance discussion featuring the dance writer Elizabeth Kaye at 12:45 p.m. in the theater (Jennifer Dunning).</p>
        <p>LAZ BREZER. A charter member of Kei Takei's Moving Earth, Laz Brezer will perform in dances by himself and Ms. Takei, a new piece by Daniel Nagrin and a collaboration with the avant-garde circus producer Keiichi Nishida.

        <p>DANCE FOR JOY MINISTRIES. Even the most committed atheist would probably admit that there is an almost religious sense of exaltation at the heart of dance. Dance for Joy Ministries, a 30-member company founded and directed by Iris Cloud, formerly with Dance Theater of Harlem, seasons its style of ballet and liturgical dance with joy in an attempt to share the gospel through dance. Sunday at 4 p.m. Tickets: $25. TriBeCa Performing Arts Center, Borough of Manhattan Community College, 199 Chambers Street .
