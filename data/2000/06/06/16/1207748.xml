        <p>The Ford Taurus factory in Atlanta has no air-conditioning to ward off the sweltering heat of the Georgia summer. Its scuffed concrete floors and sooty ceiling beams hold the grit of 53 years of car-building. On the assembly line, orange robots weld car roofs and sides and, farther down, hundreds of men and women install the cars' interiors. To all appearances, it is an utterly ordinary car factory.</p>
        <p>Yet the Atlanta plant is, in fact, special. According to a highly regarded annual study released yesterday, it was the most efficient in North America last year, representing the first time that an American-owned auto plant has surpassed Japanese-owned factories on this continent in labor productivity.</p>
        <p>What is more, productivity has improved across the United States auto industry in recent years. While the Ford plant in Atlanta ranked as No. 1, the biggest overall efficiency gains last year took place at General Motors, which was once known for inefficiency. The Ford Motor Company is the most efficient American automaker, although its performance was marginally worse by some measures last year because of the production of very big, complicated vehicles like the new Ford Excursion sport utility.</p>
        <p>Over the last several years, the Big Three Detroit-based automakers have gradually made up much, though certainly not all, of the productivity gap between their factories and those owned by the Japanese.</p>
        <p>They have done so mainly through improved management and organization rather than through the use of high-technology computers and robots, though they have integrated such equipment into their factories, according to Harbour &amp; Associates, a consulting firm in Troy, Mich., that issued the report yesterday. Japanese automakers continue to set the standard in quality, but better management is helping Detroit automakers start to catch up in reliability, too, although estimates vary widely for precisely how much the quality gap has closed.</p>
        <p>''In terms of overall performance, not just labor productivity, they continue to close the gap,'' said Ronald E. Harbour, the consulting firm's president. ''But the Japanese are not standing still, and still lead in quality, productivity and manufacturing cost.''</p>
        <p>In the 1980's, the productivity gap between American and Japanese factories, particularly auto factories, was a major preoccupation for politicians, corporate executives and investors alike. Ten years of economic stagnation in Japan and the rise of American high-technology industries have pushed auto productivity comparisons out of the limelight. But while attention has moved on to Microsoft and the Internet, much has changed in the nation's auto factories.</p>
        <p>''In the 1980's, there was a widely held, popular view that Japan represented the economic future,'' said Robert Shapiro, the under secretary of commerce for economic affairs. ''Since the 1980's, the U.S. auto industry has recovered very nicely, and in part that reflects productivity gains.''</p>
        <p>A decade ago, General Motors, Ford and what is now the Chrysler division of DaimlerChrysler required more than twice as much labor as their Japanese competitors to build a car. Today they need 21 percent to 46 percent more hours of labor in the factory. That is still a hefty disadvantage, to be sure, but it is manageable because factory labor now accounts for only a tenth of the cost of a car, as other expenses, like design and engineering, have grown throughout the industry.</p>
        <p>Detroit's problem is that it has been unable to improve management practices at all factories. But a few of the Big Three's best-run factories are now as efficient as the Japanese operations or more so, according to the study by Harbour, which prepares yearly reports based on confidential productivity data from the seven leading automakers in North America. Auto factories in Japan are slightly more efficient than Japanese-owned factories in the United States, because they are closer to some of their suppliers, but the gap with these factories has narrowed, too, Mr. Harbour said.</p>
        <p>The most productive factories are not distinguished by a higher degree of automation than their competitors. Robots are now commonplace for physically strenuous or dangerous tasks, but humans have proved themselves less expensive for many other tasks. Indeed, the most automated assembly plant in North America, the Mitsubishi midsize car factory in Normal, Ill., also had some of the lowest labor productivity last year because so many employees were constantly required to keep the robots maintained and repaired, Mr. Harbour said.</p>
        <p>What really seems to separate the productive factories from the inefficient ones is something more basic than automation, and yet more complex. ''It's good management,'' Mr. Harbour said.</p>
        <p>What particularly efficient factories have in common, he said, is that they seldom shut down their assembly lines in the middle of a shift. As a result, they rarely require unscheduled overtime to meet production quotas. G.M., Ford and Chrysler assembly lines suffered frequent shutdowns until recently, because workers were absent or auto parts reached the assembly line that were defective or did not fit together easily. The assembly lines of Japanese-owned factories almost never stop in the middle of shifts.</p>
        <p>Senior managers at Japanese automakers tend to say that high productivity comes from a constant attention to detail, advice that American automakers are starting to follow. ''There is no silver bullet,'' said Daryl Wilson, Toyota's vice president for manufacturing in Canada. The Toyota Corolla factory in Cambridge, Ontario, was North America's most efficient in 1998.</p>
        <p>At Ford's factory in Atlanta, which displaced the Toyota plant as most efficient last year, strong labor-management relations have permitted more attention to detail. Until the last few months, absenteeism was just 2 percent, one-third the rate at many factories in Michigan and Ohio. So, the factory seldom needed to use substitute workers, who are less familiar with the tasks at hand.</p>
        <p>The absentee rate inched up to 3 percent early this year, upsetting Steve Trousdale, the chairman of the local unit of the United Automobile Workers union, who is determined that the Atlanta factory not be chosen for layoffs in the next recession.</p>
        <p>In April, Mr. Trousdale sent a strongly worded letter to every union member.</p>
        <p>''Attendance must improve,'' it said.</p>
        <p>''If AWOL's go down, job security goes up,'' the letter continued.</p>
        <p>''You must be responsible and come to work!'' the letter concluded, in boldface capital letters printed in extra-large type.</p>
        <p>The national leadership of the U.A.W. discourages competition among local unions for fear that automakers will play them off against one another. But Mr. Trousdale, loyal to the workers in Atlanta who elected him, disregards such concerns. ''I've got to look at what is good for the Atlanta work force,'' he said last month at the factory. ''I don't really look at what somebody else thinks.''</p>
        <p>Yet the Atlanta factory still has union work rules guaranteeing that workers with the most seniority receive the easiest jobs, a system that limits management's flexibility. Japanese automakers, which are nonunion, do not face such rules, and organize their employees into more flexible teams that take whatever tasks most need doing.</p>
        <p>Todd Cooper, a 32-year-old worker on the Ford assembly line in Atlanta, has the task of putting 35-pound dashboards into cars day after day, grueling work assigned to those with little seniority. But he accepts this as better than his previous job as an electrician on construction sites. ''I don't have to work outside in the cold and the rain,'' he said last month, eating a sandwich from his lunchbox while sitting, exhausted, on a crate next to the line.</p>
        <p>In Windsor, Ontario, DaimlerChrysler is also paying close attention to details. Sandra Bouckley, the company's manager for advanced minivan manufacturing, is trying to change the way her company prepares for the introduction of a new model.</p>
        <p>When Chrysler redid the minivan in 1995, it closed its minivan factories in Windsor and St. Louis for nearly three months to replace equipment, losing sales. This year, Ms. Bouckley has already had the assembly line extended to make room for old and new machinery, and she has had much of the new equipment brought in over weekends. As a result, the Windsor factory will close for only two weeks between models.</p>
        <p>''This was a philosophical, technological deviation from the way we've always done business, and we decided we'd test it in Windsor,'' Ms. Bouckley said.</p>
        <p>That is a big improvement, but Japanese automakers sometimes change models in a day by making even more elaborate preparations. By contrast, DaimlerChrysler will close its St. Louis minivan factory for seven weeks this summer because the company is not yet able to change over two factories quickly at the same time.</p>
        <p>Until the mid-1990's, G.M. was the least efficient automaker in North America in stamping car hoods, doors, roofs and other parts out of big sheets of steel. Then, Joseph Spielman became G.M.'s vice president for metal parts stamping in 1994. And now, the company is the most efficient of the Big Three in stamping by some productivity measures but trails well behind Honda and Toyota. Mr. Spielman has managed this partly by standardizing equipment: he reduced the number of sizes of stamping presses to just 6 from 57, for example.</p>
        <p>That made it easier to service the machines and exchange parts among them, allowing G.M. to make do with only 200 stamping presses instead of the 350 it had in 1993. Since each press is as big as a Boeing 737-300 and carries the same price tag, $32 million, the investment savings have been huge. But G.M. has not been able to reduce employment to match because of its restrictive labor contracts, Mr. Harbour said.</p>
        <p>It is hard to improve upon Mr. Spielman's self-description: ''6-foot-6 1/2 and 250 pounds of romp and stomp.'' But as far as the U.A.W. and its members were concerned, Mr. Spielman had a little too much romp and stomp until recently. Upset by his demands for better productivity, workers at a factory in Flint, Mich., started a strike two years ago that crippled the company's production for two months, costing it $2 billion in after-tax profits.</p>
        <p>In the aftermath of the strike, both sides have been committed to greater cooperation, and Mr. Spielman has become an outspoken advocate of worker involvement. ''It isn't me out there with a cattle prod or a whip,'' he said. ''It's people out there saying, 'This is ours; this is our plant.' ''</p>
        <p>Blue-collar workers in factories are now in close touch with white-collar engineers sitting at computers in office buildings. Workers with questions about blueprints used to be told to mail letters to the engineers, waiting two weeks or more for a reply. Since January, workers have been sending e-mail messages to engineers, using personal computers in the factories. Mr. Spielman requires the engineers to respond within 24 hours.</p>
        <p>James DeLair, the local union vice president in Flint, said the changes had been noticeable. ''There seems to be a whole lot more interest in what the worker has to say,'' Mr. DeLair said. ''The working relationship, hourly to salaried, could still use improvement, but upper management wants to make things better.''</p>
