        <p>There's a lot going on in Inka Essenhigh's semi-abstract, incipiently pornographic, slick-surfaced paintings. More than completely meets the eye, which may be part of the problem.</p>
        <p>Ms. Essenhigh's new work has improved since her last show. Once again, her humanoid surrogates -- headless, sometimes limbless mutants -- strain at their bindings, hurtle about or suffer obscure humiliations on vast fields of flat off-key colors. But they are less relentlessly suggestive of members of the armed forces, their carryings-on aren't as frenetic, and Ms. Essenhigh has brightened and varied her corrupted palette. The camouflage khakis, greens and grays are giving way to a range of pinks, yellows, oranges and -- in the best work, a big painting titled ''Reconstruction'' -- a contrast of aqua and blood red.</p>

        <p>There's a lot going on in Inka Essenhigh's semi-abstract, incipiently pornographic, slick-surfaced paintings. More than completely meets the eye, which may be part of the problem.</p>
        <p>Ms. Essenhigh's new work has improved since her last show. Once again, her humanoid surrogates -- headless, sometimes limbless mutants -- strain at their bindings, hurtle about or suffer obscure humiliations on vast fields of flat off-key colors. But they are less relentlessly suggestive of members of the armed forces, their carryings-on aren't as frenetic, and Ms. Essenhigh has brightened and varied her corrupted palette. The camouflage khakis, greens and grays are giving way to a range of pinks, yellows, oranges and -- in the best work, a big painting titled ''Reconstruction'' -- a contrast of aqua and blood red.</p>
        <p>Interestingly this work, whose central swath of red seems to depict a gory operating-room drama (and a blend of Francis Bacon, Matta and Wifredo Lam), is the only one that carries from a distance. Otherwise Ms. Essenhigh doesn't quite bring off the contrast between the general and the specific, or the abstract and the sexual, that she seems to be seeking.</p>
        <p>Things get a bit programmatic, the style becomes too relentlessly consistent, the color too carefully husbanded, and monotony sets in. Ultimately you may spend more time thinking about Ms. Essenhigh's ideas, ambition and impressive array of precedents than you do enjoying or contemplating her work as complete paintings.</p>
