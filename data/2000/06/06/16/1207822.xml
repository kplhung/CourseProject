        <p>Roger Clemens was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a strained right groin yesterday, and he intends to complete his recovery in that time frame. It may be a few days, however, before the Yankees will get a better idea of how long he will be out.</p>
        <p>''We've got to rest it now,'' said Clemens, who was on the disabled list in 1993 with a similar injury. ''I don't put a lot of stock in injuries. I'm going to deal with it and get it well.''</p>

        <p>Roger Clemens was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a strained right groin yesterday, and he intends to complete his recovery in that time frame. It may be a few days, however, before the Yankees will get a better idea of how long he will be out.</p>
        <p>''We've got to rest it now,'' said Clemens, who was on the disabled list in 1993 with a similar injury. ''I don't put a lot of stock in injuries. I'm going to deal with it and get it well.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees recalled the reliever Darrell Einertson from Class AAA Columbus, but Einertson has already been told his promotion is temporary. Unless another injury alters the club's plans, Einertson will return to the minors tomorrow, and the right-hander Jake Westbrook will be called up to join the rotation.</p>
        <p>Clemens's status is likely to have some impact on how the Yankees evaluate trade possibilities. If the Yankees eventually go deep into trade talks with the Cubs about Sammy Sosa, they could ask for one of two right-handers as well -- Ismael Valdes or Kevin Tapani.</p>
