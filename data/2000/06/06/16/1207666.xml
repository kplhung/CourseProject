        <p>Although Queens may not be much of a range, it does have a home where the buffalo roam and the deer and the antelope play. It's the Queens Zoo, a center for American species, which will be shown off festively tomorrow and Sunday at Bison Bonanza Weekend.</p>
        <p>''This zoo gives you the sense of being in a national park,'' said Alison Power, a zoo spokeswoman. ''You can look at the prairie dogs and see the bison in the background, which is what really happens on the Plains.''</p>

        <p>Although Queens may not be much of a range, it does have a home where the buffalo roam and the deer and the antelope play. It's the Queens Zoo, a center for American species, which will be shown off festively tomorrow and Sunday at Bison Bonanza Weekend.</p>
        <p>''This zoo gives you the sense of being in a national park,'' said Alison Power, a zoo spokeswoman. ''You can look at the prairie dogs and see the bison in the background, which is what really happens on the Plains.''</p>
        <p>To help children get into the spirit, Regina Ress, a storyteller, will relate Navajo-inspired tales, and the zoo will offer face-painting (choose to become either a bear or a mountain lion) and craft projects, like making a bison button and a headdress of horns. The horns will be decorated with real bison wool from the fields.</p>
        <p>More opportunities to play animals will include human-size prairie dog tunnels and games like the bison bolt and the coyote challenge, a form of tag in which some will portray coyotes and others will be rabbits.</p>
        <p>''The bison bolt is basically a 50-yard dash where the kids can test their speed against that of a bison,''  Ms. Power said. ''A bison can do it in about three seconds.''</p>
        <p>The zoo considers the bison its signature animal for good reason: the Wildlife Conservation Society helped save the species from extinction in 1905, when it shipped some of its own bison out West.</p>
        <p>''Some of those out there now are descended from stock from the Bronx Zoo, which is kind of neat,'' Ms. Power said. Then again, survival skills are what New York is all about.</p>
        <p>Bison Bonanza Weekend, tomorrow and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the Queens Zoo, 53-31 111th Street, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 271-1500. Free with admission: $2.50; the elderly, $1.25; ages 3 to 12, 50 cents; under 3, free.</p>
        <p>Next Stop, the 1930's</p>
        <p>The subway has been called a lot of things, but a time machine isn't one of them. That may change on Sunday, however, when a rarely glimpsed train leaves the 59th Street-Columbus Circle stop in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>It's the New York Transit Museum's Nostalgia Train, a genuine 1928 D-type, on the first of three summer excursions.</p>
        <p>''You can sit right on the wicker seats; nothing is behind glass,'' said Roxanne Robertson, the museum's director of special projects. ''The hand grips are covered in enamel, the light bulbs are exposed and the ceiling fans operate.''</p>
        <p>The cars, of bolted steel, are the heaviest ever built, but they will seem to shed years as the train speeds to its first stop: the Transit Museum, in a 1936 decommissioned IND station in Brooklyn Heights.</p>
        <p>''This is one of the few times that our vintage rail excursions have actually driven into the Transit Museum itself,'' Ms. Robertson said. Ticketholders will have an hour to explore the space, which includes the 1878 Money Car G, the oldest existing mass-transit car.</p>
        <p>They can also pass through wrought iron and mahogany turnstiles, move the switch on a signal light and touch the equipment used by the men who dug the subways.</p>
        <p>Then it's off to the ultimate nostalgia stop: Coney Island. Travelers can trade the subway for the Ferris wheel or the waves and after two hours reboard for Jay Street-Borough Hall, 59th Street-Columbus Circle and, alas, the year 2000.</p>
        <p>New York Transit Museum Nostalgia Train, Sunday and July 9 and 23 at 9:30 a.m. (the train leaves promptly at 10), 59th Street-Columbus Circle station, Manhattan. Tickets: $25 ($20 for new museum members); under 17, $10; under 3, free (limit one free child per adult). Reservations required: (718) 243-8601.</p>
        <p>A World of Music</p>
        <p>Many children's knowledge of music doesn't go beyond tunes like ''Old MacDonald'' and the Top 40. It is Dianne Berkun's mission to take them from Britney Spears to Bach, and New Yorkers can hear the results tomorrow night.</p>
        <p>Ms. Berkun will present the Grand Finale Concert of the Brooklyn Youth Chorus Festival 2000, an event that will combine the vocal talents of the chorus, of which she is the artistic director, with those of other children's singing groups from New York and elsewhere.</p>
        <p>''What you will see is just under 400 children singing together as one mass choir,'' Ms. Berkun said.</p>
        <p>Doreen Rao will conduct the concert, which will include the Brooklyn Youth Chorus's intermediate and concert divisions, as well as the Alaska Youth Choir, Bel Canto Children's Chorus of Pennsylvania, Brooklyn Children's Ensemble, the Chapin School Choir, Plymouth Boys and Girls Choir, P.S. 102 Chorus, P.S. 140/ 142 Chorus and the Young People's Chorus of New York City.</p>
        <p>You can get a taste of their singing today at 12:15 p.m., when three of the groups will give a free performance on the steps of Borough Hall.</p>
        <p>Tomorrow night's 90-minute program, at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Opera House, will range from the Christe Eleison in Bach's B-minor Mass to Lee Kesselman's Navajo-based ''Hoshonji Song'' to Stephen Leck's ''Kungala: A Place to Sing and Shout,'' about Australia.</p>
        <p>There are so many different styles, Ms. Berkun added, that ''it's like a mini-musical journey.''</p>
        <p>Brooklyn Youth Chorus Festival 2000 Grand Finale Concert, tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. at the Howard Gilman Opera House, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100; Ticketmaster, (212) 307-4100. Tickets: $30, $15, $8. Information: (718) 243-9447.</p>
