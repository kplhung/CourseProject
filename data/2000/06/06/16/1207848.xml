        <p>Jeffrey Hammonds raced home with the winning run on a soft grounder by Brent Mayne to cap a wild ninth inning as host Colorado rallied to beat Houston, 5-4, yesterday.</p>
        <p>Todd Helton, who had not homered since May 29, tied the game at 4-4 when he hit a fastball from Billy Wagner (2-4) over the center-field fence leading off the ninth.</p>
        <p>Hammonds followed with a sharp single, advanced to second on a groundout and took third on a wild pitch. Mayne then hit a bouncing grounder to first baseman Jeff Bagwell, whose throw to the plate was high, allowing Hammonds to slide in safely under Tony Eusebio's glove.</p>
        <p>Colorado's comeback prevented Houston from winning three straight for the first time this season and gave the Rockies some momentum as they prepare for a three-game series against National League West-leading Arizona.</p>
        <p>''It picks us up for the weekend,'' Colorado Manager Buddy Bell said. ''I don't know if we necessarily needed it, but we'll take it. It's something that will help us get our hearts started.''</p>
        <p>Wagner, who had been 4 for 4 in save chances at Coors Field, blew a save opportunity for the eighth time in 14 chances this season. The Astros fell to 3-15 in one-run games.</p>
        <p>''I don't have an answer to this,'' Wagner said. ''What do you want me to do? Start making up pitches out there? I am throwing pitches and they aren't missing them.''</p>
        <p>The Colorado closer Jose Jimenez (4-0) had his own problems, allowing a game-tying single to Bill Spiers in the ninth and forcing home the go-ahead run when he walked Richard Hidalgo with the bases loaded.</p>
        <p>Helton bailed out Jimenez with his 18th home run of the season and his first in 48 at-bats.</p>
        <p>''It seemed like about 248 at-bats,'' Helton said. ''About two weeks ago, they started pitching me a little different, a little tougher. They were testing my discipline a little bit.''</p>
        <p>PIRATES 2, BRAVES 0: Kris Benson pitched a six-hitter for his first career shutout and drove in a run with an infield single, leading host Pittsburgh past Atlanta.</p>
        <p>Benson (5-5), lowering his earned run average to 2.08 in his last 10 starts, held the middle of the Braves' order to one hit and toughened up with runners on base to gain the Pirates a split in the four-game series.</p>
        <p>Benson outdueled Kevin Millwood (4-6), who made his second start of the series after lasting only one-third of an inning Monday.</p>
        <p>Kevin Young started the Pirates' fourth with a double, extending his hitting streak to 10 games, and Bruce Aven ended a 0-for-15 streak with a single to center.</p>
        <p>Millwood, winless since May 17, retired the next two hitters. But Benson, with only two hits in 23 at-bats, hit a liner off the outstretched glove of first baseman Wally Joyner. The ball deflected to second baseman Quilvio Veras, but Benson easily beat him to the bag as Young scored the game's first run.</p>
        <p>The Pirates added a run in the eighth against Bruce Chen on Brian Giles's leadoff double and Pat Meares' two-out R.B.I. infield single.</p>
        <p>DODGERS 4, DIAMONDBACKS 0: In Los Angeles, Kevin Brown (4-0) pitched a four-hitter for his third straight complete game and struck out 10 in his 16th career shutout, his first since last Sept. 4 at Chicago.</p>
        <p>Todd Stottlemyre (8-4), activated from the disabled list before the game, trailed by 3-0 after six pitches, giving up home runs to Todd Hollandsworth and Gary Sheffield and a double to Mark Grudzielanek.</p>
        <p>Eric Karros added an R.B.I. single in the eighth against Vicente Padilla.</p>
        <p>Stottlemyre, coming off the fourth stint on the disabled list in his 13-year career, had not pitched for the Diamondbacks since May 29, when he was forced out against St. Louis because of tendinitis in his right elbow. This time, he allowed three runs and five hits in six innings.</p>
        <p>Hollandsworth, playing for the first time after missing 11 games with a strained right hamstring, drove Stottlemyre's first pitch to left-center for his fifth homer, his fourth leading off a game. Grudzielanek doubled two pitches later and Sheffield hit a 1-1 pitch for his 19th home run.</p>
        <p>Stottlemyre allowed only two more hits -- a single and a double by Hollandsworth. Stottlemyre struck out seven, including Sheffield, Shawn Green and Eric Karros in succession in the third.</p>
