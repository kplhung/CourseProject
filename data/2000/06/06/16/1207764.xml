        <p>The sun setting over Jericho Turnpike cast a tangerine glow over the big white cars struggling to maneuver into the driveway. Stretch limousines, it would seem, are no longer long enough. This crowd arrived in 40-foot sport utility vehicles, Lincolns so large that they need six wheels, and even a new, somewhat oxymoronic concept: the stretch sports car, in this case a white Ferrari.</p>
        <p>Well-dressed couples emerged from the chauffeur-opened car doors. A Giorgio Armani followed by a Ralph Lauren followed by a Prada. And that was just the guys.</p>
        <p>Oscar nominees? Debutantes? Captains of industry? Try high school students. It was prom night, Long Island-style, a night where there is nothing inconspicuous about the consumption and a graduating senior is lucky to escape with a tab of less than $1,000.</p>
        <p>''It's a big night,'' explained Eric Kuscsik, 17, as he and his date stepped out of the stretch Ferrari, which he said has a mirrored ceiling and vibrating seats, and headed into the Huntington Town House for the prom of St. Anthony's High School in South Huntington.</p>
        <p>The days when proms were simple affairs in high school gyms festooned with crepe paper streamers and balloons are long gone. Driven by boom times, youthful exuberance and the matrimonial-industrial complex of high fashion, catering halls and luxury car rentals, the prom is no longer just a rite of passage; it has become a serious expenditure.</p>
        <p>Couturiers like Vera Wang now field requests for prom dresses. And after Jennifer Lopez wore a Badgley Mischka gown to the Academy Awards in 1999 (no, not the naughty one), aspiring prom queens began seeking their own Badgley Mischkas.</p>
        <p>''Rarely will they go over $3,000 for a prom dress,'' said Mark Badgley, who estimated that the firm sells a dozen haute prom dresses a year.</p>
        <p>And the prom itself is now only a small part of the equation. There are the catered pre-prom parties, where the parents who subsidize much of the revelry get to ooh and ahh and photograph their dressed-up progeny. Then there are the after-prom festivities, which often require another brand-new outfit for a nightclub or, for some, a late-night cruise.</p>
        <p>To recover from all this, many promgoers repair to the Hamptons for a few days.</p>
        <p>''It's totally blown out of proportion,'' said Kim Laffer, 18, as she prepared to go to both the Great Neck North High School prom on June 7 and her own prom, the Syosset High School prom, at the Waldorf-Astoria on June 16. ''I hate to say it, but there's a lot of competition.''</p>
        <p>Some kids even compete with themselves. When Dan Aversano and his friends rented a stretch Lexus S.U.V. last year for the junior prom of Chaminade High School, which is in Mineola, they wondered how they could possibly top themselves at their senior prom.</p>
        <p>''This year,'' Mr. Aversano, 18, said, ''we were looking to do something more.''</p>
        <p>That is how he came to rent the Truckousine: a stretch white Ford 350 pickup truck with a Jacuzzi in the bed. ''My dad thought it was a little ridiculous,'' he conceded. ''But I have to say, it was so much fun I wish I could do it again.''</p>
        <p>After the prom, he and his friends headed out to Bridgehampton, where they had rented a seven-bedroom, six-bathroom house with a tennis court and a pool for $4,250.</p>
        <p>All told, he said, his share of the expenses came to this: $387 for the house, $262 for the Truckousine, $160 for a rented black tuxedo with white lapels, $155 for two tickets to the prom itself, and $30 for a corsage for his date. Just under a thousand bucks.</p>
        <p>''There's no doubt about it: the prom is a huge industry,'' said Garfield Bowen, the publisher of Prom Guide and www.promguide.com, a directory of clothing retailers, catering halls, limousine companies, after-prom events and just about everything else the promgoer needs to prepare for the big night.</p>
        <p>Teenage magazines, fashion magazines and bridal magazines all publish prom issues and supplements that are fat with advertising. Now, at Web sites like www.yourprom.com, teenage shoppers can click on dozens of dresses by designers like Jessica McClintock and After Six and read makeup tips and horoscopes.</p>
        <p>Young men are spending more on clothes as well. ''They don't rent a tuxedo anymore -- they rent a designer label,'' said Jack M. Springer, the executive director of the International Formalwear Association. ''They want a Pierre Cardin, a Perry Ellis, an Oscar de la Renta. Mandarin collars are very big. They favor vests over cummerbunds.''</p>
        <p>A survey his group did last year found that proms accounted for a fifth of all tuxedo rentals, generating about $300 million a year.</p>
        <p>Then there are the cars. This year's hottest item is the stretch Hummer.</p>
        <p>Of course, the prom does not have to be ruinous. When Seventeen magazine did an online poll asking readers how much they planned to spend on their proms, they received 4,148 responses: 19 percent said they would spend less than $100, 59 percent said they would spend $100 to $300, and 22 percent said more than $300.</p>
        <p>But Long Island seems to be in a league of its own. ''What are all these kids going to do for their weddings?'' wondered Rhona Silver, the owner of the Huntington Town House, which holds scores of proms each year. ''They're very demanding: they want filet mignon, they want lobster tail. The days of stuffed chicken are over.''</p>
        <p>Getting ready for the prom is no small feat. Nicole Coelho, a senior at Mineola High School, had an iridescent taffeta dress custom made for her at Bridal Reflections in Carle Place, had three sessions at a tanning salon, had her hair done in Garden City and had a manicure and a pedicure.</p>
        <p>On the evening of her prom, her friends and their parents gathered at her house in Mineola. A small tent was set up outside the garage, over a table of crudites and soda. The couples exchanged corsages and boutonnieres -- the words would appear to be French for expensive flowers -- and the parents took snapshot after snapshot.</p>
        <p>Then their ride came. ''Holy moly,'' said Gena Stanisic, 40, who was there seeing off her daughter Jessica, as the 32-passenger, 6-wheel white Ford Explorer glided down the street. ''We had limos at my prom, but none of these five-mile-long jobs.''</p>
        <p>It was longer than most of the houses on the street are wide. Some parents worried about how safe it was. ''This is no problem,'' the driver, Tom McSherry, 43, reassured them. He explained that he drove even longer cars most of the year: oil rigs.</p>
        <p>Inside the Explorer were two television sets, a fake fireplace, a stereo and a Sega video game system. ''Sega? I'm not leaving the limo,'' said Vladimir Srdoc, 18.</p>
        <p>The couples piled in, and the car pulled out to the Crest Hollow Country Club, the first stop in a night that would take them to Caroline's Comedy Club in Manhattan, back to Long Island for an after-prom brunch, and then to a resort upstate for a few days.</p>
        <p>''It's your prom,'' Ms. Coelho said. ''It only happens once in your life.''</p>
