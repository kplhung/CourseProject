        <p>Baseball was emboldened to seek more from NBC and Fox because it negotiated a deal with ESPN last year in which the cable network will pay an average $138.5 million annually, nearly four times as much as its 1999 fee.</p>

        <p>In its new network rights deal, Major League Baseball is seeking two to three times as much as the combined $975 million that Fox and NBC are paying in their current deals, which expire after this season.</p>
        <p>Baseball was emboldened to seek more from NBC and Fox because it negotiated a deal with ESPN last year in which the cable network will pay an average $138.5 million annually, nearly four times as much as its 1999 fee.</p>
        <p>Fox and NBC's exclusive negotiating period, in which only they can speak to baseball, expires Monday, but it could be extended. Once the period ends conclusively, CBS can talk to baseball, probably about NBC's package, which has no regular-season baseball except for alternating All-Star Games.</p>
        <p>NBC and Fox are not expected to meet baseball's demands, largely because they do not believe their current deals are undervalued in the way that ESPN's previous contract was.</p>
        <p>'Monday Night' Announcement</p>
        <p>ABC Sports is expected to announce its replacement(s) for Boomer Esiason on ''Monday Night Football'' early next week, along with its plan to revamp various production elements of the series. Don Ohlmeyer, the producer, is said to have decided or to be very close.</p>
        <p>A vote for Dan Fouts came from Keith Jackson, with whom Fouts worked on college football last year. Fouts recently auditioned.</p>
        <p>''I'm looking for someone to replace Dan because I believe he's the man,'' said Jackson, the first play-by-play announcer on ''Monday Night,'' in 1970. ''He has just enough irreverence and a dash of show biz.''</p>
        <p>ABC is also expected to add a second sideline reporter to the crew. Lesley Visser has been the sole reporter.</p>
        <p>It's Parquet</p>
        <p>Center court of the Boston Celtics' parquet floor, which was used for 53 years, was auctioned online yesterday by sothebys.amazon.com for $331,000.</p>
        <p>Bidding soared by nearly $200,000 in the last few hours of the two-week auction, with the 30th bidder winning the section, which is made of 20 panels of red oak, and has the leprechaun emblem in the middle.</p>
        <p>Forty of the floor's 264 red oak panels, each measuring two feet by two feet, were in the auction. In addition to the center-court section, 20 other panels were auctioned individually.</p>
        <p>*The panel where John Havlicek stole an inbounds pass from Hal Greer of the Philadelphia 76ers in the 1965 Eastern Division finals sold for $28,600.</p>
        <p>*A panel honoring the Celtic Hall of Famers sold for $29,150.</p>
        <p>*A panel that was part of Kevin McHale's favorite low-post position sold for $13,035.</p>
        <p>*The panel where Phoenix's Garfield Heard heaved a last-second shot to force Game 6 of the National Basketball Association finals into a third overtime sold for $6,710.</p>
        <p>Airwaves</p>
        <p>Game 4 of the Lakers-Pacers N.B.A. finals produced a 13.1 Nielsen rating, up 9 percent from Game 4 last year. The four-game 11.1 average rating is off 2 percent from 1999. . . . Marv Albert, a Ping-Pong aficionado, will call Wimbledon for TNT.</p>
