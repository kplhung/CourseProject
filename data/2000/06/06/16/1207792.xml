        <p>Rina Banerjee, who contributed an impressive installation to this year's Whitney Biennial, is now having her first Manhattan gallery show: two of them, in fact, simultaneously and both in Chelsea.</p>

Burned-out lightbulbs and powdered spices, chunks of Styrofoam and glittering sari cloth create a hybrid version of exoticism, one that works not just West to East but in both directions, and has a creepy, spoiled, mutant beauty.</p>

        <p>Admit One</p>
        <p>529 West 20th Street, Chelsea</p>
        <p>Through June 24</p>

        <p>Rina Banerjee, who contributed an impressive installation to this year's Whitney Biennial, is now having her first Manhattan gallery show: two of them, in fact, simultaneously and both in Chelsea.</p>
        <p>Ms. Banerjee was born in India but has lived in the United States since she was a child. Her work mixes Asian and Western materials. Burned-out lightbulbs and powdered spices, chunks of Styrofoam and glittering sari cloth create a hybrid version of exoticism, one that works not just West to East but in both directions, and has a creepy, spoiled, mutant beauty.</p>
        <p>The show at Admit One, which is made up of several dense but attenuated installations, has a hothouse-garden look. Vinelike plastic tubing snakes across the wall, ending in simulated leaves and fruit that look both attractive and unsavory. They suggest the kinds of tropical specimens that Western colonialists once tried to classify and transplant, often with startling results: some plants never took but others grew out of control in new environments.</p>
        <p>Ms. Banerjee's recent work has looked less and less culturally specific, as is evident in a self-contained installation at Debs &amp; Company. The room is half-filled with a system of thick webbing, formed from endless layers of clear plastic wrap and resembling a monstrous digestive system in which handfuls of colored ritual powder and spices are trapped.</p>
        <p>The artist has given the piece a didactic title, ''Exoticism Was for Sale,'' a clear reference to the all-devouring organism known as global culture. But even without the idealogical tag, the piece has a work-intensive strangeness that holds the eye and moves beyond literal interpretation.</p>
