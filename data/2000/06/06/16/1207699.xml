        <p>It's unusual for a movie to stack the deck with a fistful of jokers, but the new version of ''Shaft'' -- part remake and part sequel -- does just that. Here, John Shaft is not a complicated man. He's not even as complicated as the second-rate score, which has more wah-wah pedal guitar effects than the ''Shaft'' marathon TNT ran a couple of nights ago. (The environmentally minded composer, David Arnold, recycles Isaac Hayes's triumphant ''Theme From 'Shaft' '' throughout the movie.)</p>
        <p>On the other hand, the always dependable and indomitable Samuel L. Jackson as John Shaft, nephew of the seminal freelance crime fighter in the 1971 original, is unmistakably the star. His sharpshooter's timing and saucer-eyed self-awareness has found a home: he's doing Samuel L. Jackson again, only this time he's called Shaft. Despite its being an assemblage of retro and contemporary cliches, the movie works as empty-headed entertainment (though a featurette on the raging battles attending the production would probably be far more compelling and just as racially charged).</p>

        <p>It's unusual for a movie to stack the deck with a fistful of jokers, but the new version of ''Shaft'' -- part remake and part sequel -- does just that. Here, John Shaft is not a complicated man. He's not even as complicated as the second-rate score, which has more wah-wah pedal guitar effects than the ''Shaft'' marathon TNT ran a couple of nights ago. (The environmentally minded composer, David Arnold, recycles Isaac Hayes's triumphant ''Theme From 'Shaft' '' throughout the movie.)</p>
        <p>On the other hand, the always dependable and indomitable Samuel L. Jackson as John Shaft, nephew of the seminal freelance crime fighter in the 1971 original, is unmistakably the star. His sharpshooter's timing and saucer-eyed self-awareness has found a home: he's doing Samuel L. Jackson again, only this time he's called Shaft. Despite its being an assemblage of retro and contemporary cliches, the movie works as empty-headed entertainment (though a featurette on the raging battles attending the production would probably be far more compelling and just as racially charged).</p>
        <p>Shaft is a Manhattan police detective when first introduced, and he makes more entrances than Joan Crawford did in her entire career. For about a third of its running time, ''Shaft'' is basically a runway show, and not for Eleganza this time. The hero is done up in Giorgio Armani's trademark sleekness, and he wears it well, though he dresses like the r-and-b performer R. Kelly. When Shaft verbally smacks down a colleague (Daniel Von Bergen) who brags about the four-bedroom house he bought in Nassau County, it's an example of the pot calling the kettle extravagant.</p>
        <p>''Shaft'' may be the most unrepentantly politically incorrect movie since the glory days of ''The French Connection.'' When Shaft is ready to go to work in one of several shootouts -- some of the most primitively staged gunplay since the Republic western serials of the 1940's -- he cocks a shotgun and cracks, ''It's Giuliani time.''</p>
        <p>Part of that lack of sensitivity may come from the writer Richard Price, who contributed the character of the drug kingpin Peoples Hernandez. As Peoples, the skillful and talented Jeffrey Wright steals the movie, though it's petty larceny, to be sure. Peoples is a trash-talking, violent exemplar of the id. His peculiar enunciation leads one to believe he has burned the roof of his mouth. ''Ju god a bin'ness car?'' he says, and we know he means ''You got a business card?''</p>
        <p>The picture wants to trade on the not-so-subtle differences between stereotype and archetype, and breaks a sweat trying to shatter each. In that way, laboring to find its own politics in the naive but powerful way the original did, ''Shaft'' becomes the United Nations of misanthropy. It has not only Peoples Hernandez but also a wealthy, heartless WASP racist, Walter Wade Jr. (Christian Bale). Wade sets the picture into motion when he beats a young black man (Mekhi Phifer) to death, then beats the rap by fleeing the country. Shaft becomes a ''black private dick'' and leaves the police force to bring Wade to justice, flinging his shield at the judge who sets Wade free on bail.</p>
        <p>Like the original, ''Shaft'' becomes a woman-in-jeopardy movie. Diane (Toni Colette), a waitress, witnesses the assault and disappears. Shaft and his friend Detective Carmen Vasquez (Vanessa Williams) set out to track her down. Peoples and Wade join forces, though the spectacle of these two battling for onscreen primacy -- the chilly, brittle Wade and the florid, sly Peoples -- is not unlike a death match between Luciano Pavarotti and Placido Domingo for the microphone.</p>
        <p>It's hard to remember so unapologetically flamboyant a movie, with two major villains and a star who welds its mismatched pieces through sheer presence. Mr. Jackson uses the intense, deliberate concentration of a Baptist preacher, even on a laugh line. Every dialogue exchange is a baptism by fire, and the hero is as much fun to watch as the villain.</p>
        <p>Though saucy and upbeat, he's judgmental; the fact that no one but his woman understands him is not an issue this time around, because he doesn't have one. Except for a sex scene in the opening with nothing but torsos -- a scene cut so quickly it almost seems subliminal and you may not be sure if Shaft is in it -- the movie has no romance.</p>
        <p>The one area in which the original ''Shaft'' succeeded is that it explicitly portrayed black men as sexual beings in a way they had never been on-screen before. Though an outrageous flirt, the nouveau Shaft has more affection for his wardrobe than anything else. It would be way too retro to have Shaft carry on with the ladies as if it were still the 70's, but it would be nice if he at least had a steady girlfriend. He's very close to the kind of guy Sidney Poitier (and Eddie Murphy in the ''Beverly Hills Cops'' movies) often played who strode into a situation, saved the day and left alone.</p>
        <p>For filmgoers, especially African-American filmgoers, of a certain generation, it's tough to stop thinking of ''Shaft'' as something that belongs to them. Simply by changing the color scheme of a shopworn genre, film noir, the original made a political statement. And by adding elements of New York cultural history, like basing the villain Bumpy Jonas on a real-life racketeer, Bumpy Johnson, it earned whispers of confidence from a black audience aware of many sides of its history.</p>
        <p>Yes, the new ''Shaft'' had to be different, if only because the remake simply couldn't generate the same visceral impact as the original. It couldn't possibly have the same giddy shock of the new.</p>
        <p>Still, this ''Shaft'' is aware of the racial politics of a different era. The scene that incites Wade to violence has a flashback scene featuring a witty triumph by the victim that's a sure-fire pleaser -- a great scene too, though it also makes clear that no one wins in such confrontations. ''Too black for the uniform, too blue for the brothers'' is the reason Mr. Jackson's Shaft gives his uncle for leaving the force. The uncle is played by the original Shaft, Richard Roundtree, cooler and silkier than ever; it's a crime he's not used more.</p>
        <p>The politics seem glib here, more cynical than in any blaxploitation-era movie, and by the end Shaft has turned into a vigilante. With plot points cribbed from the history of the black action film, from ''Gordon's War'' to ''New Jack City,'' ''Shaft'' is pasted together like a ransom note.</p>
        <p>This may be the first movie that runs under two hours and yet has no attention span. Characters are abandoned and picked up; narrative threads dissolve before your very eyes, no doubt because of the backstage battles along racial lines, including Mr. Jackson's refusal to deliver lines by Mr. Price. It is said that the director, John Singleton, and his co-producer, Scott Rudin, squabbled like Peoples and Wade. Still, ''Shaft'' will probably score at the box office. It will be a cheap, opportunistic victory, but an enjoyable one.</p>
        <p>''Shaft'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes multiple scenes of gunplay, beatings and lots of profanity.</p>
