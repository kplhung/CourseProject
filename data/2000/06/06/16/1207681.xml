        <p>It's been on and off more times than Dame Edna's wig, but the long-awaited production of ''The Unexpected Man,'' by Yasmina Reza, who won a Tony Award for ''Art,'' is apparently coming to fruition, and with an impressive cast to boot.</p>
        <p>Performances of the two-hander, about a pair of strangers meeting on a train, are to begin on Oct. 11 at the Promenade Theater. Eileen Atkins will play the female lead, a literary fan, as she did in London, where she won an Olivier Award. Opposite her is another famous face long absent from an American stage, Alan Bates. Mr. Bates, who won a Tony in 1973 in ''Butley,'' will play a writer with a story to tell.</p>

        <p>It's been on and off more times than Dame Edna's wig, but the long-awaited production of ''The Unexpected Man,'' by Yasmina Reza, who won a Tony Award for ''Art,'' is apparently coming to fruition, and with an impressive cast to boot.</p>
        <p>Performances of the two-hander, about a pair of strangers meeting on a train, are to begin on Oct. 11 at the Promenade Theater. Eileen Atkins will play the female lead, a literary fan, as she did in London, where she won an Olivier Award. Opposite her is another famous face long absent from an American stage, Alan Bates. Mr. Bates, who won a Tony in 1973 in ''Butley,'' will play a writer with a story to tell.</p>
        <p>The production, which played in London in 1998 with Michael Gambon as the writer, will again be directed by Matthew Warchus (''True West''), who also directed ''Art'' on Broadway and in the West End.</p>
        <p>The production had been rumored to be coming to New York several times since, most recently for a January run at the Gramercy Theater. But that fell through after a suitable male lead could not be found. This time, however, Julian Schlossberg, a producer, says everything is a go. ''We're very excited,'' he said. ''Our hats are over the windmill.''</p>
        <p>Signing the Stars</p>
        <p>With summer vacations looming, several of next year's big musicals have been looking to signing their leading men.</p>
        <p>Topping the list are the producers of ''The Producers,'' the musical adaptation of Mel Brooks's 1968 film satire about a pair of hapless Broadway schemers. Nathan Lane played the deranged producer Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel in the movie) in early readings and is still the leading candidate for that part. For his sidekick, Leo Bloom, the accountant turned producer played by Gene Wilder in the film, producers are pursuing Matthew Broderick.</p>
        <p>A member of the production team who spoke on condition of anonymity said the two actors were the leading choices for the roles but stressed that no deals had been signed.</p>
        <p>The musical, with a score by Mr. Brooks and a book by him and Thomas Meehan, is expected to try out in Chicago early next year before a spring opening on Broadway.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere, after several days of rumors, the producers of ''Seussical,'' the Dr. Seuss musical, were ready to confirm that David Shiner had been cast in the prime role of the Cat in the Hat. Mr. Shiner is probably best known to audiences as the clowning foil of Bill Irwin in Broadway runs of ''Fool Moon'' in 1993, 1995 and 1998. The role of the Cat, who acts as the musical's narrator, was something of a surprise for Mr. Shiner, who said he had auditioned on a lark.</p>
        <p>''I'd never done a musical before,'' he said, speaking from his home in Germany. ''So I was very relaxed. I never thought they'd take me.''</p>
        <p>Well, they did, so now Mr. Shiner is to start vocal lessons. Rehearsals begin on July 10 for a planned October opening at the Richard Rodgers Theater.</p>
        <p>Finally, the biggest guessing game in town is who might be in the running for ''Oklahoma!,'' the revival that the producer Cameron Mackintosh says he will bring to Broadway this year -- but only if he gets the right cast. He and the director Trevor Nunn have been holding casting calls for male and female leads. Spokesmen for the show were mum on casting, but those in the know say that Marc Kudisch (the cocaine-sniffing ambisexual in ''The Wild Party'') and, even more enticingly, Harry Connick Jr., have been sighted coming and going to audition rooms.</p>
        <p>Two on Broadway?</p>
        <p>Nothing is definite, but the Manhattan Theater Club could soon have two productions on Broadway.</p>
        <p>Already announced is Charles Busch's comedy ''The Tale of the Allergist's Wife,'' confirmed to open on Broadway on Nov. 2, most likely at the Barrymore Theater (currently home to ''The Real Thing''). But there is also talk that ''Proof,'' David Auburn's drama about a touched mathematician and his daughter, might have a further life as well. The theater club has already extended its run at City Center until July 30, but  several commercial producers have inquired about a run at a larger theater, possibly the Walter Kerr.</p>
        <p>There is one complication, however. Mary Louise Parker, the star of ''Proof,'' is listed on promotional material as the star of ''Desire Under the Elms,'' opening at the Roundabout Theater Company this fall. If ''Proof'' proves to have legs, someone's plans might have to change.</p>
        <p>Filling Shoes</p>
        <p>Taking on a play like ''True West,'' which calls for toaster larceny, typewriter demolition and attempted murder, is never easy for an actor. But that job is even more daunting when the roles taken over have most recently been filled by Philip Seymour Hoffman and John C. Reilly, both nominated for Tony Awards for their performances.</p>
        <p>But such is the task at hand for Josh Brolin and Elias Koteas, accomplished film actors who start their run in ''True West'' on Wednesday, with Mr. Brolin playing Austin, the soft-spoken screenwriter, and Mr. Koteas as Lee, his drifter brother. (The two will begin switching roles in late July and alternating in early August.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Brolin, who began his career in theater and will be seen in this summer's film thriller ''The Hollow Man,'' said he was eager to be back onstage. ''I think I wanted to say no, but with this play, how can you say no?'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Koteas, who has played memorable roles in ''The Thin Red Line'' and ''Crash,'' among other films, echoed Mr. Brolin's sentiment.</p>
        <p>''I was kind of searching for something to get myself back onstage,'' said Mr. Koteas, who adds that he is still getting reacquainted with the stage. ''There's technical stuff, '' he said. ''Getting used to using your voice, your body -- it's different.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Brolin says that comparisons with their predecessors are natural but dismisses them with a smile. ''People are going to write about it because it's easy to write about,'' he said. ''But it's kind of ridiculous, isn't it? It's like comparative lit, which I always thought was one of the dumbest classes ever. How do you compare one piece of art to another? They just are what they are.''</p>
