      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial lauds profound humanity of Pope John Paul II in forgiving Mehmet Ali Agca for assassination attempt in which Pope was critically injured in 1981; says it is possible that Agca, who has been extradited to Turkey where he was convicted in absentia for murder, will now speak about his crime but it is unlikely that he will clear up mysteries that surround his terrorist past</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The pardon of Mehmet Ali Agca, would-be assassin of Pope John Paul II, is a reminder that cold-war mysteries may still lie buried in the archives of the former Soviet Union and the East bloc.  Mr. Agca shot the pope at his weekly general audience in St. Peter's Square on May 13, 1981. John Paul was wounded in his hand and stomach, and required two operations and four and a half months of convalescence. Whether Mr. Agca acted alone or at the bidding of the K.G.B. and the Bulgarian secret service, or was backed by the Gray Wolves, a right-wing Turkish terror group to which he belonged, is still unknown.</p>
        <p>The pardon granted by Italy's president was long sought by the pope, who announced from his bed after the shooting that he forgave Mr. Agca. The pope visited Mr. Agca in prison in 1983, and later received Mr. Agca's mother at the Vatican.</p>

        <p>The pardon of Mehmet Ali Agca, would-be assassin of Pope John Paul II, is a reminder that cold-war mysteries may still lie buried in the archives of the former Soviet Union and the East bloc.  Mr. Agca shot the pope at his weekly general audience in St. Peter's Square on May 13, 1981. John Paul was wounded in his hand and stomach, and required two operations and four and a half months of convalescence. Whether Mr. Agca acted alone or at the bidding of the K.G.B. and the Bulgarian secret service, or was backed by the Gray Wolves, a right-wing Turkish terror group to which he belonged, is still unknown.</p>
        <p>The pardon granted by Italy's president was long sought by the pope, who announced from his bed after the shooting that he forgave Mr. Agca. The pope visited Mr. Agca in prison in 1983, and later received Mr. Agca's mother at the Vatican.</p>
        <p>Mr. Agca has been returned to prison in Turkey. He was convicted in absentia for the murder of a moderate Turkish newspaper editor and sentenced to death, but the sentence was later reduced to 10 years. While it is possible that Mr. Agca will now speak about his crime, it is unlikely he will clear up the mysteries. He has said that the Bulgarians and Soviets backed him. But he has also said he acted alone, and claimed in court to be Jesus. In 1986 three Bulgarians and three Turks were acquitted of conspiracy to kill the pope for lack of evidence, an ambiguous verdict in Italy.</p>
        <p>East bloc archives are inconclusive. The Russian government has produced cables that purport to show that the K.G.B. was surprised by the attempt. But K.G.B. defectors have said they saw other cables asking how to ''get close'' to the pope -- code, they assert, for assassination.</p>
        <p>What we do know is that after the pope saw his assailant in prison, he said, ''I spoke to him as I would speak to a brother whom I have forgiven and who enjoys my confidence.'' Those standing outside the cell watched him fold his hands around Mr. Agca's several times. The existence of such profound humanity is a mystery of another sort, one that will remain always elusive.</p>
