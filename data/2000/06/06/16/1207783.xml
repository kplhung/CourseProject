        <p>To some, Commerce Secretary William M. Daley is as affable, self-effacing and disarmingly smooth as any top-drawer lobbyist in this town. To others, he is the perfect child of Chicago's gritty machine politics: brass-knuckles tough, vindictive and, at times, searingly blunt.</p>
        <p>But there is broad agreement among those who know him that Mr. Daley is perhaps the best political mind in President Clinton's cabinet.

        <p>To some, Commerce Secretary William M. Daley is as affable, self-effacing and disarmingly smooth as any top-drawer lobbyist in this town. To others, he is the perfect child of Chicago's gritty machine politics: brass-knuckles tough, vindictive and, at times, searingly blunt.</p>
        <p>But there is broad agreement among those who know him that Mr. Daley is perhaps the best political mind in President Clinton's cabinet. And for that reason, many Democrats cheered the announcement today that Mr. Daley will be leaving the administration next month to become chairman of Vice President Al Gore's presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>''He is genetically prepared for this,'' said Senator Richard Durbin, Democrat of Illinois. ''Politics is in his bloodstream.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Daley, the youngest son of Chicago's most famous mayor and the brother of its current one, inherits a campaign that has been described by some Democrats as adrift, dispirited and plagued by divisions. And while no one expects Mr. Daley to fix all the problems by himself, many Democrats say he brings the right mixture of tools to the task.</p>
        <p>He is a centrist with strong ties to business leaders at a time when Mr. Gore is trying to position himself as a prudent manager of the economy. He is a consummate behind-the-curtains manager adept at avoiding the kind of controversy that has at times bedeviled the Gore campaign. And he is tough enough an in-fighter to enforce discipline on a campaign that has sometimes lacked it.</p>
        <p>''You know there is a price to pay if you cross him,'' said Representative Robert Matsui, a California Democrat. ''And that's extremely important in running a campaign.''</p>
        <p>Most recently, Mr. Daley, 51, has been a central figure in the administration's push to get Congress to give China permanent normal trade relations. Congressional and White House officials credit Mr. Daley not only with being one of the administration's best lobbyists on the China bill, but also its chief strategist. It was Mr. Daley who drew up the initial list of undecided Democrats to focus on. And it was Mr. Daley who had the best instincts about how to handle each one, the officials said.</p>
        <p>''His instincts are such that he knows when to be exceedingly blunt, and when to be softer and gentler in tone,'' said Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative. ''He is very affable and on a dime can become very steely.''</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Daley's effective handling of the China bill did not sit well with leaders of organized labor, and Mr. Daley will have to move swiftly to smooth things over with Mr. Gore's union allies.</p>
        <p>''There are some wounds out there in the labor community that need to be healed,'' said Representative Rod Blagojevich, a Chicago Democrat.</p>
        <p>Though he has never run for office, Mr. Daley has had ample experience helping on the presidential campaigns of Walter F. Mondale, Michael S. Dukakis and Mr. Clinton. But it was at his father's feet, and in the mayoral campaigns of his brother, Richard, that Mr. Daley clearly learned his politics.</p>
        <p>David Axelrod, a Democratic consultant from Chicago who has worked for the Daleys, tells a story about how Mr. Daley responded to a newspaper column by Mike Royko describing Mr. Daley and his brother, Richard, as ''too dumb to tie their shoes.''</p>
        <p>Instead of hollering back, Mr. Daley called the columnist and said, ''I just want you to know we're all wearing loafers now.''</p>
        <p>Similarly, Mr. Daley's brother, John, fondly describes how his younger sibling consistently escaped punishment at their Roman Catholic school, even though he was engaging in the same kinds of pranks as the other kids.</p>
        <p>''He never got caught,'' said John, a Cook County commissioner. ''You couldn't talk the Jesuits out of anything. He just knew how far to go. He was very smart.''</p>
        <p>But critics say Mr. Daley's suave exterior can hide a vindictive personality. Representative Luis V. Gutierrez, a Chicago Democrat, said that Mr. Daley called his office and berated one of his aides after Mr. Gutierrez endorsed former Senator Bill Bradley for the Democratic nomination.</p>
        <p>''To me, he's the kind of Machiavellian person behind the prince,'' Mr. Gutierrez said.</p>
        <p>William Michael Daley was born on Aug. 9, 1948 in Chicago, where he stayed for all of his schooling: De La Salle High School, Loyola University and John Marshall Law School.</p>
        <p>He was president and chief operating officer of the Amalgamated Bank of Chicago from 1990 to 1993, and has been a partner in one of Chicago's biggest law firms, Mayer, Brown &amp; Platt.</p>
        <p>In 1993, after Mr. Daley helped run the Clinton campaign in Illinois, the President tapped him to shepherd the North American Free Trade Agreement through Congress. And in 1996, Mr. Clinton chose him to replace Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown, who had died in a plane crash.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daley and his wife, Loretta, have three children. The family still resides in Chicago, where Mr. Daley returns on weekends.</p>
        <p>Today, both Democrats and Republicans who support the China bill lamented that he would not be there to push it through the Senate. But Democrats said they expect him to bring the efficiency to the campaign that his father brought to running Chicago.</p>
        <p>''Bill has the best political gut of anyone I've ever known,'' said Mr. Axelrod, the Chicago consultant. ''I think that is an inherited trait.''</p>
        <p>THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: MAN IN THE NEWS  Correction:  June 20, 2000, Tuesday  A Man in the News article on Friday about Commerce Secretary William M. Daley misidentified the Chicago high school that he attended. (The error also appeared in a profile of Mr. Daley on Dec. 14, 1996.) It was St. Ignatius High School, now called St. Ignatius College Prep, not De La Salle High School.</p>
