        <p>It's been 20 years since I left Long Island to live in Atlanta, and I've spent my entire working life here, so I guess that by now you may call me an Atlantan. I have gotten used to finding the city's fanciest restaurants in strip malls, and I have even done the tomahawk chop. I have grieved over my estrangement from the ocean and gone on. There is indeed only one thing that serves to remind me that this is not where I'm from nor where I intend to end up, one thing that reminds me -- in the incessant and inventive kvetching it inspires -- that I am, after all, a New Yorker: the accursed Atlanta heat.</p>
        <p>I have never gotten used to it. I don't want to get used to it, for the same reason poor souls cast into perdition probably don't welcome the forecast, no matter how diabolically upbeat the weatherperson: it's hell; I'm not supposed to like it. I'm not equipped for it, genetically or culturally. Indeed, in a region that has seen the continual blurring of regional distinction, the heat -- or, rather, one's opinion of it -- has always served as an enduring line of demarcation between native Southerners and Yankee expatriates.</p>
        <p>For me and my wife and everyone else we know who hails from the North, the heat of an Atlanta summer is nothing short of a pestilence. We are driven to fits of desperate nostalgia about summer days when the breeze billowed in the curtains, absolving us of the obligation to air-condition, and the lemony light pouring through the windows was soft and benign. ''We used to love summer!'' we say, with sad insistence. ''We used to go outside!''</p>
        <p>Southerners, on the other hand, still love the summer, even though they never go outside unless they have to. Tthey have a sentimental attachment to the heat; they were formed in it, and so was their society. They feel sort of patriotic about it, the way they feel about kudzu, which takes so much of its character from the expansive temperatures that it ends up metaphorical.</p>
        <p>Southern nostalgia celebrates not the freedom of summer but rather its creeping stasis, as manifested in Papaw's penchant for seersucker and straw hats, the fan Mamaw wielded when it got really hot, and the sweet tea that doused the sweat from Mother's delicate upper lip. Of course, as it has gotten hotter and hotter the heat has begun to obliterate, even here, the notion of summer as a storehold of memory, as it chases people from the sultry porch swing to the chilly TV room: who, after all, can get nostalgic about air-conditioning?</p>
        <p>Now we hear from the U.S. government that the South is literally on the rise, boiling up through the temperate latitudes and becoming so pervasive that Atlanta's weather will become New York's, as Houston's will become Atlanta's. I have lived in Atlanta long enough to adopt some of its defensive boosterism, so there's part of me that wants to say it serves New York right for scoffing at our cosmopolitan pretensions. At the same time, I wonder how New Yorkers are going do in the heat, since in the South climate is concomitant with culture, and the endless miasmic summers are the crucible in which generations of genteel Southerners learned to sweat while standing still.</p>
        <p>I wonder how New Yorkers are going to do when the heat becomes simultaneously startling and numbing, when the sun becomes this whitish disc fixed in the sky, when humidity leaches the brilliance from the moon and the stars, when long-awaited rains wind up trickling down like seepage or sweat, when the heat wakes up as early as a cranky baby and stays up as late as a drunken guest.</p>
        <p>I'm enough of a New Yorker to want to tell you how I've done: I've become a heat-obsessive, a heat-crank. I've gone around the bend. I've written such phrases in my journal as ''the sun, it is winning,'' and two years ago I started a novel only to realize that I had written the first 20 pages about a sunstroked dog trying to get a drink of water.</p>
        <p>My tongue hangs out from May to October, and now I'm facing the fact that those corny variations of Saul Steinberg's famous depiction of Gotham sold by Atlanta gift shops --  you know, the whole world reduced to the vantage from Peachtree Street -- were horribly prescient.</p>
        <p>In an effort to flee the omnipresence of air conditioning, my wife and I recently set about buying a house on Long Island, though now, in light of the Congressional report predicting the heat's northward progression, the thing we worry about is the house's lack of precious A.C. There is no escape, you see. The whole world is Atlanta, unless you happen to live here, in which case the whole world is Houston.</p>
