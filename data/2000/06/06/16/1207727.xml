        <p>New York City can still afford to offer its residents and businesses some new tax cuts in the coming year, but probably not as much as originally planned, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday.</p>
        <p>That assessment by the mayor came after state lawmakers agreed this week to give retired state and city government workers annual cost-of-living increases in their pensions.</p>
        <p>Initially, city officials feared that the pension enhancements might cost the city budget as much as $1 billion in 2001, wiping out the city's ability to offer new tax cuts, like a reduction in the personal income tax rate that would save the average taxpayer an estimated $99 a year.</p>
        <p>But because legislative leaders agreed to phase in the pension enhancements over five years and to curtail the size of the annual increase in benefits, city officials estimated yesterday that it would now cost an extra $98 million in the 2001 fiscal year, growing to $586 million in additional contributions to the pension systems by 2005.</p>
        <p>With the biggest impact not set to hit until after Mr. Giuliani leaves office, the mayor said yesterday that the city could still enact some new tax cuts this year. To ease the crunch on his successor, the mayor indicated that he also intended to order city agencies to find ways to reduce spending at the start of the new fiscal year on July 1.</p>
        <p>''There is room for tax cuts,'' the mayor said yesterday at a news conference at City Hall. ''Not as much room as we originally thought,'' he said, meaning before the automatic cost-of-living increase came along, ''but more room than we thought a couple of weeks ago.''</p>
        <p>The city still needs approval from state lawmakers to adopt the changes in its tax rates, action that is considered likely but is not expected to happen until the last day of the legislative session next Thursday, said Assemblyman Herman D. Farrell Jr., chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.</p>
        <p>Assuming these changes are approved, Mr. Giuliani said yesterday that he would meet with the City Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone, to decide how much of the approximately $415 million in tax cuts endorsed this month should be enacted.</p>
        <p>City Council officials said yesterday that it was too early to handicap which tax cuts were most likely to survive. Aside from the reduction in the personal income tax, options include a reduction in the commercial rent tax and the creation of city tax credits for the elderly who rent apartments and for parents who pay for child care.</p>
