      <abstract>
        <p>Thomas L Friedman Op-Ed column says smooth succession of Bashar al-Assad after death of his father, Hafez al-Assad, was orchestrated by coalition of Alawite tribal elders, key army officers and his powerful brother-in-law Gen Asef Shoukat; says key question is not what sort of Syria Bashar al-Assad wants, but what sort of Syria his backers want; says Bashar is offered up as a liberalizer, but not one who will go too far; notes, however, reserve of repressed energy among Sunni elite and younger generation, who may not put up with from Bashar what they put up with for so many years from his tyrannical father; notes additional threat to Bashar of Hafez's brother Rifaat, now in exile, who tried to claim Syria's leadership when Hafez died (M)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>If you want to understand Syrian politics today, after Hafez al-Assad's death, go to the video store and check out three movies: ''Pinocchio,'' ''The Wizard of Oz'' and ''Godfather II.''</p>
        <p>''Pinocchio'' is useful because if you believe that Bashar al-Assad has, by himself, orchestrated his own smooth succession of his father, well, then I have some lakeshore property in the Syrian desert I'd like to sell you. Bashar is Pinocchio; the real question is who is Gepetto? Who is pulling the strings behind the scene?</p>
        <p>Until last week Bashar's only title was head of the Syrian Computer Society. Within hours after his father's death he was named the armed forces commander, and the Syrian Parliament passed a law lowering the minimum age of the Syrian president from 40 to 34. Bashar is 34. You have to love that. They didn't bother with 30 or 25, they went right to B-34. Bingo. Who whispered to the Parliament to do that? Bashar alone? I don't think so.</p>
        <p>It would be wrong to assume that Bashar is simply a puppet. He appears more serious than that. But it would be unwise to assume he is ruling alone. His father met a lot of opposition when he tried to elevate Bashar earlier. So Bashar needs friends. For the moment a coalition of Alawite tribal elders, key army officers and his sister's powerful husband, Gen. Asef Shoukat, seem to have come together to back him. This means that the real question is not simply what sort of Syria Bashar wants, but what sort of Syria his Gepettos want.</p>

His father met a lot of opposition when he tried to elevate Bashar earlier. So Bashar needs friends. For the moment a coalition of Alawite tribal elders, key army officers and his sister's powerful husband, Gen. Asef Shoukat, seem to have come together to back him. This means that the real question is not simply what sort of Syria Bashar wants, but what sort of Syria his Gepettos want.</p>
        <p>''What we have here is a coalition of the family, the elders and the chieftains who have decided that Bashar offers the best vehicle for survival, because with Bashar they can present a united front against the great challenges ahead,'' said Rob Satloff, head of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. ''He offers the image of a liberalizer, perhaps enough to keep Syria's Sunni majority from exploding after the passing of the reviled Hafez, but not one who will go too far. He offers the image of an economic reformer, who can entice foreign investment and economic aid, but not one who will crack down on corruption too harshly. And with Bashar they have someone who, unlike his father, might actually smile at Israelis, without giving away anything in substance.''</p>
        <p>Which leads to our next film, ''The Wizard of Oz.'' You know the scene -- the one where Dorothy's house lands on the Wicked Witch and all the munchkins come out to sing ''Ding, dong, the witch is dead.'' That is exactly how many Syrians feel today about the end of President Assad's cruel tyranny. Syria's Sunni elite, and the rising new generation, are hungry to join today's global conversation.</p>
        <p>If you want to understand Syria today, study Iran. The Iranian mullahs kept the lid on almost as tight as Hafez did, but when they finally had an election 75 percent of Iranians  voted for the leader who wanted to loosen the lid.</p>
        <p>The single most underestimated force in international affairs today is what happens -- thanks to globalization -- when we all increasingly know how everyone else lives. People everywhere start to demand the same things, and when they can't get them, they get frustrated. No wonder the Syrian lawmaker Youssef Jedani was quoted in The Times as saying of Bashar: ''There are very high expectations, because he's young and open and wants to give more liberty and democracy.'' But Mr. Jedani added: ''I think he'll follow the same rhythm as his father. You can't go fast here.''</p>
        <p>Oh, yeah? There is a lot of repressed energy in Syria, and the young will not put up with indefinitely from Bashar what they put up with for so many years from his father. Managing that pent-up energy may be Bashar's biggest challenge.</p>
        <p>Provided Bashar survives -- which brings us to ''Godfather II.'' No sooner was Hafez dead than his brother Rifaat, who in 1982 saved the family's rule by crushing the Muslim fundamentalist uprising in Hama, claimed Syria's leadership. Rifaat is in exile, but he controls an Arabic satellite TV station, which he uses to beam messages into Damascus. Could Bashar ever do to Rifaat what Michael Corleone did to his brother Fredo when he proved disloyal in ''Godfather II'' -- have one of his thugs take Fredo fishing and then shoot him in the head? If I were Rifaat, I wouldn't go fishing with any strangers.</p>
