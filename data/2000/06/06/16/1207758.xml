        <p>Lawyers for the Miami relatives of Elian Gonzalez today asked all 12 judges of the federal appeals court based in Atlanta to reverse a decision that would allow the boy's father to take him back to Cuba.</p>
        <p>Two weeks ago, a panel of three judges from that court dealt a major setback to the relatives who have been trying to keep 6-year-old Elian in the United States. The three judges ruled unanimously that the Immigration and Naturalization Service, part of the Justice Department, had the authority to decide that only Elian's father could act for such a young child in immigration proceedings.</p>
        <p>Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, opposes the request for asylum filed on the boy's behalf by the Miami relatives. Mr. Gonzalez, who has been living with his son in a leafy Washington neighborhood while the legal case is being decided, has said he will return to Cuba with Elian as soon as possible.</p>
        <p>The Miami relatives, who had been given 14 days to appeal the panel's decision of June 1, filed papers today contending that the judges had misinterpreted the law and the Constitution. In particular, they argued that the judges had neglected considering a Supreme Court ruling issued last month, which they contended should have a substantial effect on the case.</p>
        <p>The three-judge panel based its ruling largely on a 1984 Supreme Court decision that executive branch agencies like the immigration service are entitled to wide discretion in interpreting their own regulations. While the  judges gave broad hints that they did not agree with the immigration service's decision to deny an asylum hearing, they were emphatic that the agency's officials were free to make a decision without judicial interference as long as it was not unreasonable.</p>
        <p>''Although courts should not be unquestioning, we should respect other branches' policy making powers,'' the judges wrote.</p>
        <p>But lawyers for the Miami relatives say the three judges ignored a ruling the Supreme Court handed down on May 1. In that case, the justices ruled 6 to 3 that courts need not defer to an executive agency decision that is ''contained in an opinion letter'' as opposed to a  ruling made after a formal procedure in which notice is given and comment is taken from the public.</p>
        <p>The May 1 ruling came in a Texas case in which the justices rejected a Labor Department ruling and said public employers, like state governments and their agencies, can require employees to take compensatory time off at specific times.</p>
        <p>The immigration service's decision on whether a 6-year-old like Elian could seek asylum independently from his father was an agency interpretation of the existing law.</p>
        <p>''This error undeniably affected the outcome of this case,'' said the brief filed for Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez.</p>
        <p>To gain a rehearing, Lazaro Gonzalez and his family would have to persuade at least 7 of the 12 judges on the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit. The odds are generally against obtaining such a review because of the momentum provided by the earlier opinion. But if the Miami relatives should succeed, Elian's case would carry on for weeks, if not months, as the full 12-member court reviewed the case.</p>
        <p>If the full court denied the request for a rehearing, it would set in motion a process that would allow Juan Miguel Gonzalez to take Elian back to Cuba in a matter of days. The boy's father is under a court order not to remove Elian from the United States. But the three-judge panel said the order would be lifted as soon as it issued a mandate enforcing the ruling. Under normal circumstances that would occur seven days after the final decision at the appeals court level.</p>
        <p>That means, for example, if the full court declined to hear the case, Juan Miguel Gonzalez would be free to return to Cuba with Elian seven days later. The only remaining remedy for the Miami relatives would be to seek an emergency stay from the Supreme Court within those seven days. But that would be a remote possibility if the appeals court decided against them because the Supreme Court issues such stays only in cases in which there is a substantial likelihood of success.</p>
        <p>Attorney General Janet Reno, who has been resolute in insisting that the boy belongs with his father, said today that she hoped ''that the matter could be considered and ruled upon promptly and that we can go forward.''</p>
        <p>Lawyers for Juan Miguel Gonzalez and the Justice Department have until Tuesday morning to file a reply brief with the appeals court.</p>
        <p>Elian was picked up floating on an inner tube off Florida after the boat in which he and his mother had been bound for the United States capsized. His mother and 10 others drowned, and Elian was placed by the authorities with Lazaro Gonzalez in Miami.</p>
