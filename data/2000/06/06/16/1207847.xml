        <p>Russ Johnson singled home the winning run in the ninth inning and Steve Trachsel threw his second complete game of the season as the host Tampa Bay Devil Rays beat the Anaheim Angels, 2-1, last night.</p>
        <p>John Flaherty opened the bottom of the ninth with a single off Shigetoshi Hasegawa (5-2). Steve Cox reached safely and the pinch-runner Miguel Cairo advanced to second on second baseman Adam Kennedy's error.</p>
        <p>Cairo then stole third, prompting the Angels to walk Bobby Smith to load the bases with no outs.</p>
        <p>It was the second straight game Tampa Bay won in its last at-bat. Fred McGriff hit a two-homer during a three-run ninth inning in the Devil Rays' 3-2 victory over Anaheim on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Trachsel, who gave up one run and six hits, entered looking for back-to-back victories for the first time since posting consecutive 1-0 victories over Boston and the Yankees last month.</p>
        <p>The right-hander recorded a complete-game victory on May 6 over the Red Sox's Pedro Martinez. Five days later, Trachsel (5-6) worked seven shutout innings and beat the Yankees' Orlando Hernandez.</p>
        <p>Anaheim's Jarrod Washburn allowed one run and two hits over seven innings. He struck out four, but walked six. Over his past two starts -- covering 14 innings -- the left-hander has given up two runs and seven hits.</p>
        <p>Tampa Bay's Bubba Trammell broke a scoreless tie with a solo homer in the sixth inning. Trammell's seventh homer of the season traveled an estimated 415 feet and struck an overhanging catwalk about 110 feet above the playing surface.</p>
        <p>The Angels tied it at 1-1 on Troy Glaus's run-scoring groundout in the seventh.</p>
        <p>The Angels failed to capitalize on scoring chances in the third and fourth innings.</p>
        <p>Darin Erstad was thrown out by the right fielder Jose Guillen when he tried to score from second on Scott Spiezio's single in the third.</p>
        <p>In the fourth, Mo Vaughn was left stranded after a leadoff double.</p>
        <p>MARINERS 12, TWINS 5: Mike Cameron set a career high with four hits, tied his major league-best with five runs batted in and hit his first career grand slam for visiting Seattle.</p>
        <p>Rob Ramsey (1-1), who relieved the injured starter Paul Abbott, pitched two and two-thirds innings for his first major league victory, and Rickey Henderson had three singles, scored three runs and reached base four times for Seattle.</p>
        <p>Alex Rodriguez and John Olerud each hit two-run homers off LaTroy Hawkins in the ninth.</p>
        <p>Twins starter Mark Redman (4-2), who surrendered six earned runs on eight hits, five walks and no strikeouts, needed 82 pitches to record seven outs.</p>
        <p>He gave up three straight singles to start the game before Edgar Martinez bounced into a fielder's choice, driving in one run. Cameron followed an R.B.I. single by Henderson in the second with a shot over the power alley in left for a 6-1 lead.</p>
        <p>In the fifth, Henderson singled, stole second and scored on Cameron's single off Hector Carrasco. Alex Rodriguez made it 8-1 with another single.</p>
        <p>Cameron's night wasn't all good. He misplayed Corey Koskie's drive in the seventh and the ball bounced off his glove for a two-run double.</p>
        <p>The Twins scored two more in the eighth, on Butch Huskey's run-scoring groundout and Jay Canizaro's R.B.I. single.</p>
        <p>RAMIREZ TO BEGIN ASSIGNMENT: Manny Ramirez, the Indians' All-Star right fielder, one of nine Cleveland players on the disabled list, will begin a rehabilitation assignment today at Class AA Akron.</p>
        <p>Ramirez, out since May 30 with a strained left hamstring, is expected to be the designated hitter and play some right field this weekend when the Aeros play host to the Altoona Curve.</p>
        <p>''We want him to get 16 to 20 at-bats,'' said Indians Manager Charlie Manuel, who hopes to have Ramirez back in time for a four-game series at first-place Chicago next week.</p>
        <p>Ramirez's hamstring has not completely healed and he has yet to run at full speed on it. .</p>
        <p>Ramirez was batting .322 with 13 homers and 47 runs batted in when he was injured.</p>
