        <p>Fighting between Ethiopian and Eritrean soldiers paused today as ministers from both nations prepared to sign a preliminary cease-fire on Sunday that would involve yet another role for United Nations peacekeepers in a conflict in Africa.</p>
        <p>In all, the two-year war -- which has cost tens of thousands of lives -- seems decisively closer to an end. Today top ministers from each nation were preparing to travel back to Algeria to sign the document brokered there by the Organization of African Unity over the last two weeks. On Wednesday night, a final hurdle was cleared when Ethiopia  accepted the plan, which Eritrea approved last week.</p>
        <p>Outside officials said they were cautiously optimistic that this was the first concrete step toward peace.</p>
        <p>''It's more than a simple 'O.K., we will not shoot,' '' said a senior administration official in the United States, which was deeply involved in negotiating the deal. ''It's a very solid foundation to deal with remaining issues.</p>
        <p>''The important thing is that in signing this they are committing to resolving these issues politically and peacefully and not through the barrel of a gun,'' the official said.</p>
        <p>The plan calls for an immediate cease-fire and the creation of a 15-mile buffer zone, outside the range of most artillery fire, to be patrolled by United Nations peacekeepers. That buffer zone would be entirely in Eritrean territory, reflecting the gains Ethiopia won on the ground in the last month.</p>
        <p>But officials said the signing would be only the first step toward a resolution of the conflict. The heart of the final deal is an independent commission to establish the border between the two nations officially, a complicated process involving century-old colonial treaties that are far from clear. Disagreement over who owned what, in fact, set off the war in May 1998.</p>
        <p>There is also a question of what will happen in the next weeks or months, in the time between the signing and the arrival of the first peacekeepers. Ethiopian forces will remain on Eritrean territory until then -- and for two weeks afterward -- and no one rules out further skirmishes.</p>
        <p>Officials from both sides, however, said today that they would respect the cease-fire and that they would now turn their attention to the demarcation of their 620-mile border. The issue may be particularly important to Eritrea because Ethiopian troops have not only pushed it out of the disputed areas but now occupy  land that unquestionably belongs to Eritrea.</p>
        <p>''Territorial gains mean nothing,'' said Yemane Ghebremeskel, a spokesman for the Eritrean president, Isaias Afwerki.</p>
        <p>Ethiopian officials, denying that their losses were huge, cast the war as a protection of their sovereignty,  which they say Eritrea violated by moving troops into several areas along the border it claimed as its own in May 1998. Selome Taddesse, a spokeswoman for Ethiopia's prime minister, Meles Zenawi, said she believed it would be proved that the territory belonged to Ethiopia.</p>
        <p>''I am confident we have nothing to lose,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Before the war began, Ethiopia and Eritrea had been allies, with growing economies and a close friendship with many Western nations, the United States chief among them. In 1993, Eritrea, for a generation the northernmost province of Ethiopia, won its independence, though the new border between them was never officially marked off.</p>
        <p>A series of border skirmishes escalated quickly into full-scale warfare, with long lines of trenches, tanks, artillery bombardments and air raids. In the process two nations considered to be the most stable on the Horn of Africa -- in the same region as Sudan and Somalia, in a near-constant state of war -- were also thrown into disarray.</p>
        <p>Officials from both nations, as well as Western countries looking to restore that stability, say they hope they can begin to concentrate again on developing their now-demolished economies.</p>
        <p>One major issue outstanding is exactly what role the United Nations will play and when. A United Nations spokeswoman, Marie Okabe, said a three-member planning team was expected to go Algeria this weekend to begin preparations for the deployment of peacekeepers.</p>
        <p>But, she said, the Security Council has not decided whether to actually  send them. So there are no estimates of when they could go, from which countries and in what numbers.</p>
        <p>The agreement comes at an awkward time for United Nations peacekeeping operations in Africa, only weeks after dozens of peacekeepers were kidnapped in Sierra Leone. That debacle has cast doubt on a planned operation for Congo, in which 5,537 peacekeepers and observers have been approved to shore up a shaky peace deal among six nations fighting there.</p>
        <p>Several officials said, however, that the peacekeeping operation in Ethiopia and Eritrea would be far more straightforward: peacekeepers could be deployed along a clearly established front line between opposing armies that have largely fought by the generally accepted rules of war. There are none of the irregular forces or renegade rebel troops that can make peacekeeping operations far more complicated, uncertain and treacherous.</p>
        <p>''It's a very different operation,'' the United States official said. ''But obviously the parties are going to have to live up their agreement. And there is no justifiable reason for guns to be fired once this agreement is signed.''</p>
        <p>Amid the vague language of the preliminary peace agreement, there are already differing interpretations in how each side views the peacekeepers' role. Ms. Taddesse said the peacekeepers must be confined to the buffer zone in Eritrea. Mr. Ghebremeskel, the Eritrean spokesman, said he understood that peacekeepers were to patrol both sides of the border.</p>
