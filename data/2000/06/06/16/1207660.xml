        <p>A brash young space traveler with festering father-son issues, his tart-tongued female colleague and a crew of oddly shaped intergalactic creatures: if the basic ingredients of Don Bluth and Gary Goldman's ambitious animated film ''Titan A.E.'' sound awfully familiar, it's because in some ways this handsomely designed intergalactic adventure could be described as Son of ''Star Wars.''</p>
        <p>But in many other respects the movie is not a George Lucas imitation. Its guiding concept imagines the human race literally lost in the stars and scattered about the universe in ''drifter colonies'' after an alien invasion in the 31st century has destroyed the planet. Even then the survivors and their descendants are pursued by the aliens who drove them from their home. Huddled in their enclaves, these refugees hoard useless earthly bric-a-brac that reminds them of their home. (''A.E.'' stands for ''After Earth.'')</p>
        <p>''Titan A.E.'' goes only so far in implying a multi-species equality. Without designating a hierarchy it suggests that humans are still superior to almost everyone else. That's why their enemies, the Drej, are determined to chase them to the ends of the universe if necessary.</p>
        <p>Then why, given the movie's poignant notion of humans as intergalactic exiles, does so much of ''Titan A.E.'' feel emotionally flat and mechanically tossed off? Despite some gorgeous sequences, including one set in a lake of glowing hydrogen ''trees,'' ''Titan A.E.'' is bland. Although crammed with action, little of it produces roller-coaster thrills of adventure and self-discovery.</p>
        <p>Part of the problem may have to do with our ever loftier technological expectations of science fiction movies in the post-''Star Wars'' era, and ''Titan A.E.'s'' animation techniques are certainly innovative. The two-dimensional figures interact seamlessly with three-dimensional computer-generated surroundings that are richly colored and loaded with intriguing gadgetry. But when thrust into complex environments that cry out for real human figures, the animated characters tend to seem smaller than life.</p>
        <p>''Titan A.E.'' has problems in pacing, storytelling and character definition. In striving to be all things to all generations, the screenplay, adapted from a story by Hans Bauer and Randall McCormick, vacillates uneasily between the fluff of Saturday morning cartoons and fairly sophisticated wisecracking. Although the action sequences are lively, they zip by too fast to build up much cliffhanging excitement.</p>
        <p>When we first meet the movie's hero, Cale (Matt Damon), he is a towheaded little boy whose father, a military scientist, is racing against time to complete a secret operation, the Titan Project, that could save humanity from extinction. Earth is about to be destroyed by the Drej, a race of soulless aliens described as ''pure energy,'' who swarm in shape-shifting formations of laser-blue lights and speak in mechanized, metallic mumbo jumbo.</p>
        <p>As the end of the world looms, Cale's father bids a hasty farewell to his son before shipping him off to safety. Although the boy is desperate to remain, his father is firm about his having to leave and promises that one day they will be reunited. In a parting gesture he gives his son a magic ring that he says will protect him from harm.</p>
        <p>The story leaps ahead more than a decade. Cale is now a rebellious teenage dock worker at a space station that resembles a grungy junkyard of rusting outmoded machinery. Seething because he believes his father abandoned him, he has little regard for humanity. But his feelings suddenly change when he discovers that the ring his father left him contains a genetically encoded map to guide him to the Titan, a spaceship designed to save humanity and concealed somewhere in the universe.</p>
        <p>With Korso (Bill Pullman), the space captain of the spaceship Valkyrie and an old acquaintance of his father, Cale embarks on this ultimate treasure hunt. In close pursuit are the Drej, who know of the Titan's existence and are waiting for Cale to lead them to it. As the code is deciphered step by step, the predictable space battles erupt, and two of Cale's fellow treasure hunters reveal a treacherous side.</p>
        <p>One signal that Korso is not entirely a good guy is his red goatee. Action heroes just don't wear goatees, especially red ones. Mr. Pullman's John Wayne-like vocal swagger is just a little too exaggerated for comfort. Korso's wily first mate, Preed (Nathan Lane), is even more suspicious. Haughty and slightly effeminate with a Vincent Price voice, he conforms to Hollywood's stereotypical image of the effete villain.</p>
        <p>Also on board the Valkyrie is Akima (Drew Barrymore), a curt, resourceful Eurasian-looking pilot, and a crew that includes the vessel's eccentric, turtle-like navigator, Gune (John Leguizamo), and its sour, grumbling weapons specialist, Stith (Janeane Garofalo).</p>
        <p>''Titan A.E.'' tries to pack so much into 90 minutes that the characters don't have enough screen time to engage our emotions. Cale and Akima in particular have all the depth of television spinoffs of Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia. This is not to say that ''Titan A.E.'' isn't entertaining in its breezy, mild-mannered way, only that its mythology and characters barely resonate.</p>
        <p>''Titan A.E.'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes action sequences that could frighten very young children.</p>

Cruden; produced by David Kirschner, Mr. Bluth and Mr. Goldman; released by 20th Century Fox. Running time: 90 minutes. This film is rated PG.</p>
