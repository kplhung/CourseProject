        <p>The United Nations is hoping to finish up the job of verifying that Israel has withdrawn from southern Lebanon, but its work was frustrated today when Israeli soldiers fired shots near a United Nations team visiting one of the last remaining unchecked border sites.</p>
        <p>Israeli authorities expressed regret over the incident, which forced the postponement of an expected announcement here that the border verification was complete.</p>
        <p>''They said it was a stupid mistake and let's get on with the verification tomorrow,'' a United Nations spokesman, Fred Eckhard, said. He and other officials expressed confidence that the tortuous task could be completed on Friday.</p>
        <p>Four shots were fired into the air and a fifth into the ground, just yards from the deputy commander of the United Nations peacekeeping contingent in southern Lebanon. The shots forced the inspection team, consisting of United Nations and Lebanese military officials, to retreat from the immediate area.</p>
        <p>Confirmation that Israel has left southern Lebanon would allow the United Nations to start deploying its own peacekeepers on the border and give the signal for the Lebanese government to reassert its authority in southern Lebanon.</p>
