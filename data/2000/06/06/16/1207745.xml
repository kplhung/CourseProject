        <p>The government decision to close the 19 nuclear power plants in Germany over the next 20 years reflects the power of the environmentalist movement in a country where the trauma of war has imbued the term ''nuclear'' with a powerful negative resonance.</p>
        <p>''No other country has undertaken this course in such an ambitious way,'' said Rezzo Schlauch, leader of the Green Party Parliamentary Committee. ''The shutdown of almost 20 plants in about 20 years amounts to a triumph for the Greens, and we believe other countries will follow our example.''</p>
        <p>The agreement reached today between the ''Red-Green'' coalition of Chancellor Gerhard Schroder, a Social Democrat, and the energy industry sets out a program for the fastest elimination of nuclear energy ever pursued by a major economic power. The plan would deprive Europe's largest economy of the current source of one-third of its power.</p>
        <p>In France, nuclear power accounts for more 70 percent of the energy needs, and in the United States, the figure is close to 20 percent. But in neither of those has concern over nuclear energy polarized society as in Germany.</p>
        <p>This is a country where environmental concerns are evident in everything from the stunning multiplicity of garbage cans provided for every form of recycling to the decision of many furniture stores to shun any object made from wood not obtained in ecologically sound ways.</p>
        <p>The precise pace of the closing was left flexible in an accord reached after what Volker Heck, a spokesman for the major RWE energy company, called ''a not very friendly discussion.''</p>
        <p>He suggested that power utilities had accepted the accord because they were tired of the constant and costly harassment that has surrounded their nuclear operations and because the large surplus of electrical power in Germany will allow them at least five years to consider what new plants to build.</p>
        <p>A limit on the amount of electricity generated, equivalent to an average total working life of 32 years for each nuclear plant, was set. Because the last plant was built in 1989, that would suggest that the last plant would close in 2021.</p>
        <p>But as energy companies will be able to allot the permissible output as they choose among plants, some operations may continue beyond that date. In effect, the quick closing of inefficient plants will allow energy companies to use efficient ones longer.</p>
        <p>''The figure of 32 years helps the Greens politically, but we were in fact left with some room to maneuver,'' Mr. Heck said. That flexibility was a condition of the companies in accepting an accord that provides for no financial compensation.</p>
