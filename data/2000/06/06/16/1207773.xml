        <p>Editorial on unfolding clash between Russian Pres Vladimir Putin and small group of business titans who control much of their nation's wealth; says Russian democracy will remain stunted as long as oligarchs retain stranglehold on economy but problem cannot be remedied by misusing prosecutorial power against them, which seems to be case in arrest of media mogul Vladimir Gusinsky; says Putin must find way to challenge tycoons that does not eviscerate freedom of press and other liberties Russians so recently won</p>

        <p>The shape of Vladimir Putin's presidency could well be determined by the unfolding clash between the Russian leader and the small group of business titans who control much of their nation's wealth. Certainly, Mr. Putin faces no more difficult task than determining how to curb their political and economic influence without trampling on Russia's newly found freedoms. His government has not made a promising start by arresting Vladimir Gusinsky, an oligarch who owns Russia's only independent television network and some of its most fearless newspapers and magazines. Mr. Putin seemed to acknowledge as much yesterday when he called the arrest ''excessive.''</p>
        <p>There is good reason to be alarmed by the raw power often exercised by the tycoons. Like the moguls who built corporate empires in the United States in the first decades of industrialization, the Russian business barons have taken advantage of an unregulated economy to gain control of banks, transportation systems and natural resources like oil and gas. With a hand from government officials, they bought valuable state enterprises for a pittance when the Kremlin privatized Russia's industrial assets after the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p>

        <p>The shape of Vladimir Putin's presidency could well be determined by the unfolding clash between the Russian leader and the small group of business titans who control much of their nation's wealth. Certainly, Mr. Putin faces no more difficult task than determining how to curb their political and economic influence without trampling on Russia's newly found freedoms. His government has not made a promising start by arresting Vladimir Gusinsky, an oligarch who owns Russia's only independent television network and some of its most fearless newspapers and magazines. Mr. Putin seemed to acknowledge as much yesterday when he called the arrest ''excessive.''</p>
        <p>There is good reason to be alarmed by the raw power often exercised by the tycoons. Like the moguls who built corporate empires in the United States in the first decades of industrialization, the Russian business barons have taken advantage of an unregulated economy to gain control of banks, transportation systems and natural resources like oil and gas. With a hand from government officials, they bought valuable state enterprises for a pittance when the Kremlin privatized Russia's industrial assets after the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>They have used their wealth to manipulate Russian politics to protect their financial interests. Sometimes those interests have dovetailed with reform, as when the oligarchs supported Boris Yeltsin for re-election in 1996 against a Communist opponent. But that is not always so. The tycoons, for example, have opposed effective banking regulation and an overhaul of Russia's broken tax system.</p>
        <p>Russian democracy will remain stunted as long as the oligarchs retain a stranglehold on the economy and the Kremlin. But the problem cannot be solved overnight, nor can it be remedied by arresting the businessmen or misusing prosecutorial powers to intimidate them, which seems to be the case with Mr. Gusinsky. Rather than reverting to the practices of a police state, Mr. Putin must begin the hard but essential work of creating a system of law and regulation that over time diminishes the power of the magnates and insures a more equitable distribution of economic assets as Russia develops its free-market economy.</p>
        <p>Because Mr. Gusinsky and some of the other moguls like Boris Berezovsky, Vladimir Potanin and Mikhail Khodorkovsky own large news organizations, any government move against the oligarchs inevitably raises sensitive free-press issues. The arrest of Mr. Gusinsky this week was especially unsettling because his media companies have carried the most critical coverage of Mr. Putin and the war in Chechnya. The growth of a robust and inquisitive free press in Russia has been one of the most encouraging developments since the demise of Communism, and should not become a casualty of conflicts between the government and the oligarchs. Mr. Putin must find a way to challenge the power of the tycoons that does not eviscerate the liberties Russians so recently won.</p>
