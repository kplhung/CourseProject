        <p>Roberta Smith reviews Richard Prince's photographs at Barbara Gladstone Gallery (S)</p>

        <p>Barbara Gladstone Gallery</p>
        <p>515 West 24th Street</p>
        <p>Chelsea</p>
        <p>Through June 30</p>
        <p>Richard Prince is still, or again, up to no good. After 20 years of showing in New York he can eke out work that disturbs, resists assimilation as art and questions authorship. He has also, after several bouts of painting, gone back to photograph appropriation. In the past he was famous for rephotographing photographs, often ''ganging'' together separate but related images onto single sheets of paper. These rather elegant works function as lexicons of American obsessions and subcultures: surfing, motorcycles, low-riders.</p>
        <p>Now Mr. Prince is simply grouping images, handsomely matted, in single frames, like a dedicated collector of memorabilia. Most of them are publicity photographs of stars of rock, stage, screen and television -- celebs du jour -- with signatures and dedications provided by Mr. Prince. Mixed with these are bits of art, some of it by Mr. Prince, and personal arcania (like a photograph of Cindy Sherman, once Mr. Prince's girlfriend).</p>

        <p>Now Mr. Prince is simply grouping images, handsomely matted, in single frames, like a dedicated collector of memorabilia.

        <p>Blondness, heavy metal, cowboy hats, Courtney Love: these are some of the things that seem to connect various groups of images. Sometimes there is an editorial comment: five photographs of Brooke Shields in different incarnations (including Mr. Prince's photograph of her famous prepubescent bathtub session) is joined by an image of Robin Curtis, in everyday clothes but wearing her Klingon makeup from ''Star Trek,'' in other words a freak.</p>
        <p>But the true freak here is fame itself and the distortions it visits upon all parties. The simplest evidence may be a work that groups a photograph of Charles Bronson as Geronimo with three checks signed by Mr. Bronson, all made out to plumbers and contractors.</p>
