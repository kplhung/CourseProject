        <p>In the beginning there was research, some legal work and in some cases a lot of restoration. The result is a niche and a Web site: www.broadwayarchive.com, which specializes in theatrical productions made for television. Gathered together they make an unusual outcropping in the home video sea.</p>
        <p>At present about 40 productions are available on videocassette at the site, most of them from PBS. Swoosie Kurtz and Geraldine Fitzgerald star in Eugene O'Neill's ''Ah, Wilderness!'' (1976); Blythe Danner and Frank Langella in Tennessee Williams's ''Eccentricities of a Nightingale'' (1976); Irene Worth in Samuel Beckett's ''Happy Days'' (1980); Dustin Hoffman and Eileen Brennan in Maxwell Anderson's ''Star Wagon'' (1966); James Earl Jones and Raul Julia in ''King Lear'' (1974).</p>

        <p>At present about 40 productions are available on videocassette at the site, most of them from PBS. Swoosie Kurtz and Geraldine Fitzgerald star in Eugene O'Neill's ''Ah, Wilderness!'' (1976); Blythe Danner and Frank Langella in Tennessee Williams's ''Eccentricities of a Nightingale'' (1976); Irene Worth in Samuel Beckett's ''Happy Days'' (1980); Dustin Hoffman and Eileen Brennan in Maxwell Anderson's ''Star Wagon'' (1966); James Earl Jones and Raul Julia in ''King Lear'' (1974).</p>
        <p>Productions to be added go back to the Dupont Show of the Month and the Kraft Television Theater in the 50's and 60's: George C. Scott and Agnes Moorehead in ''A Tale of Two Cities'' (1958); Lee J. Cobb and Eli Wallach in ''Don Quixote'' (1959); Julie Harris and E. G. Marshall in ''The Night of the Storm'' (1961); Laurence Olivier, Judith Anderson, Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy in ''The Moon and Sixpence'' (1961).</p>
        <p>To start such a collection one negotiates for rights and goes digging for the material, wherever it has landed over the years. ''Basically, they were rotting in warehouses,'' said Andrew Barrett, a vice president of the Broadway Theater Archive, which began looking for the productions in 1996 in broadcasters' vaults, libraries, museums and other likely spots.</p>
        <p>And there are hundreds more out there to be found. The owners include estates, production companies and various individuals. About 70 broadcasts have come from WNET. Mr. Barrett said that owners have been cooperative. ''They realize that no one else is doing this, and their stuff would be lost forever,'' he said. Information: (800) 422-2827.</p>
        <p>Pooh-Bahs Return</p>
        <p>''We all know the old-fashioned answer to that question,'' said Mike Leigh, whose film ''Topsy-Turvy,'' nominated for four Academy Awards, is to be released on Tuesday on tape and DVD by USA Home Entertainment. The question was how he feels about the film on video. ''Basically I hope that anybody who sees it has a pretty big screen.''</p>
        <p>The big, colorful film about the difficult and sometimes hilarious relationship between the librettist William Schwenck Gilbert and the composer Arthur Sullivan was a departure for Mr. Leigh, noted for small and highly original urban dramas. ''On a level of naughtiness and anarchy, I was attracted by the sheer unlikelihood of me doing such a project,'' he said from London.</p>
        <p>But there were fundamental connections. ''The main subject of the film is one I endlessly come back to, which is the tension between what we are and what we pretend to be, the mask,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Reflections like these make good additions to director's commentaries on DVD, particularly when the director is as expressive as Mr. Leigh. Someday he will make a commentary, he said, but there is none on the disc available next week.</p>
