        <p>North and South Korea yesterday pushed for cooperation on the athletic level, as well as the political. Both sides are speaking encouragingly about the possibility of marching together at the opening ceremonies of the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, on Sept. 15.</p>
        <p>The plan calls for North and South Korea to march under the Olympic flag, as well as the flags of the two countries, Olympic officials said. The countries would field separate teams for competition in Sydney, but they are being encouraged to send a joint team to the 2001 world table tennis championships in Japan.</p>

        <p>North and South Korea yesterday pushed for cooperation on the athletic level, as well as the political. Both sides are speaking encouragingly about the possibility of marching together at the opening ceremonies of the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, on Sept. 15.</p>
        <p>The plan calls for North and South Korea to march under the Olympic flag, as well as the flags of the two countries, Olympic officials said. The countries would field separate teams for competition in Sydney, but they are being encouraged to send a joint team to the 2001 world table tennis championships in Japan.</p>
        <p>Kim Un Yong, a member of the International Olympic Committee and a National Assembly member from South Korea, proposed the joint march last month to Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the I.O.C.</p>
        <p>On May 25, after the countries had announced plans for the landmark summit talks that took place this week, Mr. Samaranch wrote to the presidents of both countries and proposed the Olympic march. He said it would ''not only contribute to peace in the region but will also allow joint training and mutual cooperation.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the North Korean I.O.C. delegate reacted positively to the South's suggestion of a unified march in Sydney. ''I am expecting the joint entrance of the South and North Korean teams at the Sydney Olympics,'' said Chang Ung, the I.O.C. delegate from North Korea, was quoted as saying.</p>
        <p>A show of solidarity in the Olympics would represent a political victory of sorts for Kim Un Yong, who seeks to succeed Mr. Samaranch as I.O.C. president but received a severe warning from the Olympic committee last year in the wake of the Salt Lake City bribery scandal. His son, known as John Kim, has been indicted on charges that he received a sham job paid for by Salt Lake's Olympic organizers.</p>
        <p>Talks have begun on the possibility of North Korea playing host to some matches in the 2002 men's World Cup, scheduled to be held in Japan and South Korea. The two Koreas fielded a joint team for the 1991 world table tennis championships.</p>
