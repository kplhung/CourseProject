        <p>IT was hard to suppress a sigh while reading about Bishop Edward M. Egan's farewell to Connecticut the other day.</p>
        <p>Bishop Egan, who will be installed on Monday as the Roman Catholic archbishop of New York, held a final news conference in Bridgeport, his soon-to-be-former base. He covered a range of topics, including his hopes for strong interfaith relationships.</p>
        <p>So far so good. But then he told a lighthearted story about a visit he had made to a synagogue in Stamford, where, he recalled, all the ushers wore ''white beanies.'' That's when the wheels came off the wagon.</p>
        <p>Not because the bishop had said anything terrible. It was because he and his staff started biting their nails over the possibility that someone in New York, long on outrage and short on humor, might -- underline might -- think he had said something terrible.</p>
        <p>''The bishop felt that perhaps he misspoke,'' a worried spokesman said soon after the news conference. Some Jewish listeners, he fretted, might take offense.</p>
        <p>Now, it is true that ''beanie'' has an air of silliness about it and may not be the most felicitous word for the head covering worn by many Jews to show devotion to God. ''Skullcap'' would have been better. But if ever a slip fell under the heading of So What, this was it. That was the feeling of many prominent Jews, including the head of the Anti-Defamation League, an organization whose antennas are always up for possible slurs.</p>
        <p>And that was the reason for the sigh. The episode said less about Bishop Egan than it did about New York. It underlined the discouraging extent to which the city is perceived not as a ''gorgeous mosaic,'' to use that weary cliche, but rather as a basket case of ethnic and racial hypersensitivity, a place where the slightest misstep can scald you, where even an archbishop must fear where he treads.</p>
        <p>All too often, that perception is reality.</p>
        <p>New York is not alone in this regard, of course. You may recall how Washington's local government became a laughingstock last year when a white official resigned under fire (he was later rehired) after correctly using the word ''niggardly'' while discussing a budgetary matter with a black colleague. The colleague took offense instead of looking in a dictionary. The word, of Scandinavian origin, means ''miserly'' and has nothing to do with the similar-sounding racial slur.</p>
        <p>You could easily see the same kind of situation occurring here. It is almost impossible to talk or write negatively about a public figure in this city without hearing cries of bias from some New Yorkers who share that person's ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation.</p>
        <p>You have a problem with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani? That makes you anti-Italian, to hear some people tell it. Find flaws in the Rev. Al Sharpton? You must be a racist. Question the wisdom of a New York hate-crimes law? That's because you despise gays.</p>
        <p>OVER-THE-TOP touchiness has reached the point where some see prejudice against their professions. This goes well beyond Shakespeare's ''kill all the lawyers'' line.</p>
        <p>A news article about the Wendy's massacre last month described a suspect as the man thought to have been ''the architect of the crime.'' One New York architect, his tongue not detectably in cheek, complained in a letter to the editor about this ''most unfortunate analogy.'' There it is: the ugly face of anti-architect bigotry. One would call this a butchering of common sense, but that might invite a protest by meat cutters.</p>
        <p>The latest group to detect occupational bias is the New York police force, angry over a new Bruce Springsteen song lamenting the killing of Amadou Diallo by four plainclothes officers.</p>
        <p>Plenty has been said about this song and the hyperventilating over it by uniformed men and women who are supposed to be tough guys, able to take anything. But it seems worth noting that one police union leader, Robert N. Lucente, managed to give offense while taking offense. He dismissed Mr. Springsteen with a crude antigay slur that, in context, made zero sense.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lucente apologized. But not before gay members of the New York City Council felt obliged to join the fray by calling a news conference to denounce him.</p>
        <p>Round and round New York's wheel of sensitivity spins, as Bishop Egan is about to discover. Here's an unsolicited tip for the new archbishop: don't sweat the beanies. What you may want is a helmet, to deflect the bean balls of outrage that one group or another is sure to aim at your head before long.</p>
