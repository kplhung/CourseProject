        <p>It sometimes seems as if the film industries of a peaceful, prosperous, and more or less united Europe have staked their survival on recreating the strife, misery and division of the European past. In recent years, the political catastrophes that convulsed the continent in the middle decades of the 20th century have become fodder for costume drama, as horror gives way to sentimentality.</p>
        <p>Recent films like Istvan Szabo's ''Sunshine'' and Regis Wargnier's ''East-West'' confront the brutality and moral ugliness of fascism and Stalinism, but they infuse the past with an unmistakable air of romance. This development is troubling but inevitable. For all our commitment to remembering, the past does recede. Its specific hurts become less acute, and its ephemera -- silk stockings and veiled hats, boxy automobiles and charming rural towns -- become objects of nostalgia.</p>

        <p>It sometimes seems as if the film industries of a peaceful, prosperous, and more or less united Europe have staked their survival on recreating the strife, misery and division of the European past. In recent years, the political catastrophes that convulsed the continent in the middle decades of the 20th century have become fodder for costume drama, as horror gives way to sentimentality.</p>
        <p>Recent films like Istvan Szabo's ''Sunshine'' and Regis Wargnier's ''East-West'' confront the brutality and moral ugliness of fascism and Stalinism, but they infuse the past with an unmistakable air of romance. This development is troubling but inevitable. For all our commitment to remembering, the past does recede. Its specific hurts become less acute, and its ephemera -- silk stockings and veiled hats, boxy automobiles and charming rural towns -- become objects of nostalgia.</p>
        <p>''Butterfly,'' Jose Luis Cuerda's delicate, quietly devastating new film, is doubly nostalgic since it filters its tale of ideological cataclysm through the eyes of a child. But Mr. Cuerda, who fashioned ''Butterfly'' out of several linked short stories by Manuel Rivas, views childhood realistically, as a state of curiosity and confusion, rather than of preternatural wisdom or angelic innocence, and so ''Butterfly,'' though it has the look of a picture postcard from the olden days, arrives with the urgency of a telegram.</p>
        <p>Moncho is a sensitive, observant boy living in a Galician town in the summer of 1936, when Republican Spain was on the threshold of civil war. This was a time when ordinary Spaniards, according to the film's introductory titles, were torn between the desire for social progress and the demands of tradition. In Moncho's family, this tension takes the shape of occasional disputes between his father, a tailor with Republican sympathies, and his churchgoing mother, who is, as her husband affectionately puts it, ''very mystical.''</p>
        <p>The town itself is less amicably divided, and there are portents -- black-hatted Civil Guards lurking in the woods, testy exchanges between the local schoolmaster and the parish priest -- of the strife to come. Of course, the main upheavals in the boy's life are not political at all, but are rather the usual jolts and bewilderments of the coming-of-age story.</p>
        <p>Manuel Lozano, who plays Moncho, has a wide-eyed, slightly pouty face that registers amazement, bafflement and an almost scholarly intellectual appetite. Moncho is equally fascinated by the physiology of bugs and the mechanics of human sex (which he observes while spying, with his best friend, Roque, on the town drunk sporting in a hay loft with the town tramp).</p>
        <p>''Butterfly'' is a bit like a calmer, less bawdy ''Amarcord'' -- full of the magical absurdity of recollected boyhood, set to the brassy tumult of a ragged provincial dance band. But Moncho's story, inevitably, involves a loss of innocence, which the stealthy arrival of fascism renders particularly devastating.</p>
        <p>After his doting parents and his dreamy, saxophone-playing older brother, Moncho's most important relationship is with Don Gregorio, a freethinking schoolmaster whose unorthodox ideas about pedagogy and discipline (to say nothing of religion and politics) make him a suspect, as well as a revered, figure in the town.</p>
        <p>As Don Gregorio, the great Spanish actor Fernando Fernan Gomez, recently seen in a small role in Pedro Almodovar's ''All About My Mother,'' embodies the faltering, slightly comic dignity of the doomed republic. His every word and gesture signal his faith in democracy, progress and the innate perfectibility of human nature.</p>
        <p>This makes him a tragic figure, and gives the film's nostalgia a core of raw political anguish. Don Gregorio, with his passion for science and stubborn (and frequently tested) belief in the decency of the boys he teaches, personifies the flawed, valiant attempt at modern secular democracy that was driven underground and all but extinguished by Franco. If ''Butterfly'' makes you feel that loss anew, it also looks at it from a consoling distance, so that the betrayal of democracy becomes an enactment of personal, intimate, childish weakness rather than an inexplicable evil.</p>
        <p>''Butterfly'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has some nudity, a brief sex scene and violence that is all the more upsetting for being suggested rather than shown.</p>
        <p>BUTTERFLY</p>
