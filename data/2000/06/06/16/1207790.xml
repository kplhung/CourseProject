        <p>'A Working Street Photographer, 1940's-90's'</p>
        <p>Brooklyn Museum of Art</p>
        <p>200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park</p>
        <p>Through Aug. 6</p>
        <p>A fast eye, a quick mind and a speedy shutter are essentials for a good street photographer, a breed of picture taker with which Vivian Cherry proudly identifies. Over the last half-century she has shot neighborhoods of Brooklyn and the Lower East Side, Depression-era Harlem, Times Square, Mexico, the rural South and the Third Avenue El in New York City.</p>
        <p>This show of more than 70 works, organized from the museum's own collection by Barbara Head Millstein, curator of photography, has some real strengths. Among them is a 1948 series on small boys in New York City playing at adult violence, menacing each other with authentic-looking toy guns and staging ''lynchings.'' (One disturbing scene shows a black youth, well into the spirit of the game, posing as a lynchee against a wall.)</p>

        <p>Ms. Cherry has a field day with two 1955 series on the old Third Avenue elevated transit line, which had brutalized the avenue with noise and darkness since 1878. The series on riding the El offers, among other treats, a window glimpse of a man, mouth open, in a dentist's chair as seen through a V of the line's underpinnings. The other series, on razing the El, includes lively vignettes of sidewalk watchers and a shot of a heroic-looking demolition man, cigarette on lip, absorbed in directing the downward path of a pair of steel beams. (No hard hats in those days, only goggles and caps turned backward.)</p>
        <p>For recent works, taken in Mexico and Times Square, Ms. Cherry has turned to color, with less impressive results. The earlier photographs, enhanced by the vintage appeal of their black-and-whiteness, have an edge that the later ones lack.</p>
