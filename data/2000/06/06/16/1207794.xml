        <p>'The Use of Evidence'</p>
        <p>Gorney Bravin &amp; Lee</p>
        <p>534 West 26th Street</p>
        <p>Chelsea</p>
        <p>Through June 30</p>
        <p>Emil Lukas's mixed media paintings might best be seen as rudimentary thought experiments. Like a boy scientist, Mr. Lukas keeps wondering where this or that improbable process might lead. In this he resembles artists like Tom Friedman and Tim Hawkinson, though his works are less labor intensive and less craftily inventive than theirs.</p>
        <p>Usually the Pennsylvania-based artist focuses on processes and materials. He puddles paint into the convexities of deformed canvases or fills the cracks between glass tiles and then removes the tiles, leaving a pattern of raised grout lines. In one piece, he dropped a sheet of glass onto wet plaster, which dried into a remarkable, all-over bubble pattern. In part of another, he put live maggots into a hole in a block of plaster and poured ink over them; when they crawled out, they left trails, creating an abstract painting.</p>

        <p>Mr. Lukas's works are philosophically engaging because they call attention to gaps in ordinary thinking. In ''Mixing Cups,'' he imbedded 12 different cups that he had used for mixing paint in a block of plaster, turning the cups into negative holes. Why, this piece seems to ask with Zen-like equanimity, should we be any less interested in what is outside than what is inside the cups?</p>
