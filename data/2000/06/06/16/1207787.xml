        <p>WITH every pair of eyes in the gallery staring back at the 16th tee, a marshal who had been stationed for hours along the fairway ropes had a question.</p>
        <p>''How does he stand?'' the marshal asked.</p>
        <p>''Five under,'' somebody said. ''He birdied 14.''</p>
        <p>To identify the golfer on the 16th tee, ''he'' was enough. In other years in golf, ''he'' meant Jack Nicklaus and earlier it meant Arnold Palmer, but ''he'' now means Tiger Woods, who floated through the fog at Pebble Beach for a six-under-par 65 in the opening round of the 100th United States Open.</p>
        <p>Perched above the cliffs and surf of Carmel Bay, it's as if Pebble Beach is out there on the planet golf, especially when the fog separates it from the tall green woods of the Del Monte forest.</p>
        <p>''June gloom,'' the world's best golfer was saying now. ''This is what people from southern California call it; this is what happens every June. The fog, the low clouds roll in. They burn off early in the afternoon, and you have a wonderful summer but generally that's the way it is along the coast.''</p>
        <p>When red numbers, denoting strokes under par, kept going up next to his name on the Open leader boards, it indeed was June gloom for all the other golfers who now have to try to overtake him.</p>
        <p>Neither fog nor four missed greens in regulation deterred golf's he-man from his appointed round of 65 that ended with his being unable to see the green of the 543-yard 18th hole from the tee. ''I know where I need to line up on 18 off the tee, so I went with my target out there,'' he explained. ''My hazard stake wasn't visible, but there are three corporate tents out there in a line that fit perfectly with the line I wanted, so I ripped it right at it.''</p>
        <p>After his 300-yard drive soared to a stop in the first cut of rough to the right of the fairway, he drilled a 4-iron into a greenside bunker, blasted to about 18 inches and holed the putt for his sixth birdie.</p>
        <p>But for all his celebrated length off the tee, his accurate approach irons and five par-saving putts created his lowest score in his six Opens. Listen to his clinical description of his other birdies:</p>
        <p>On the 331-yard fourth hole, ''a 60-degree sand wedge to about a foot, made that.'' On the 106-yard seventh, ''a pitching wedge to about 20 feet left, made that.'' On the 446-yard 10th, ''an 8-iron to about 15 feet, made that.'' On the 399-yard 13th, ''a 9-iron to about a foot, tapped that in.'' On the 573-yard 14th, ''I hit a driver, driver, pitched up there to about a foot, tapped that in.''</p>
        <p>Arriving at his drive on that 14th fairway, he surveyed the remaining 257 yards to the flagstick. When those in the nearby gallery saw him pull out his driver, they whooped. They thought he was going for the green. But he wasn't.</p>
        <p>''I had 257 on the front, which I thought I could hit a 3-wood to with no problem,'' he recalled. ''But I didn't feel that was the play, because if I hit a 3-wood and it flies in the bunker, it could bury. I went with the driver, trying not to cut it so it doesn't run up the gap and over the green.</p>
        <p>''I was trying to put the ball in the rough, short of the green or in the bunker. I felt if I could hit the ball in the bunker, it would roll up the bank and back down and still be on the upslope of the bunker. That didn't happen. I pulled it a little bit and got underneath the tree.''</p>
        <p>From the thick rough, his pitch stayed under that overhanging tree, floated just onto the fringe and rolled down to about a foot away.</p>
        <p>''That's why we came, to see the game,'' a voice in the gallery said in awe of that pitch shot. ''You'll never see a shot better than that one.''</p>
        <p>Yes, you will, if not today then maybe on the weekend because he and Pebble Beach were made for each other. He was 12 when he and his father, Earl, drove up from Cypress, Calif., to play it for the first time. He doesn't remember what he shot that day but he thought the course played ''really long.'' When he later returned for the California State Amateur, he thought it ''played short.''</p>
        <p>And at age 24, how did he think it played yesterday?</p>
        <p>''Difficult,'' he said. ''The fairways were fast and running. You can run out of room on some of those doglegs if you don't shape your shot properly.''</p>
        <p>But with Tiger Woods, difficult is a relative term.</p>
