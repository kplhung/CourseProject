        <p>Gore Replaces Chairman Of Presidential Campaign  Vice President Al Gore said Commerce Secretary William M. Daley, regarded as a shrewd operative in Democratic politics, would replace Mr. Gore's campaign chairman, Tony Coelho, who is hospitalized with an inflamed colon. Mr. Daley, a scion of the Chicago political family, will leave the cabinet on July 15. Though Mr. Coelho's departure was attributed to the advice of his doctors, many Democrats said the move was inevitable, given the way that Mr. Gore's campaign had been struggling.</p>

        <p>Citing rising budget surplus estimates, Mr. Gore said he would offer Americans $500 billion in tax cuts over 10 years, twice what Mr. Gore had proposed and half of what his Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush had proposed. Gore aides said the tax cuts would primarily be limited to families with children and aging parents while Mr. Bush's would apply across the board.</p>

        <p>Bush Plan for the Disabled  Gov. George W. Bush proposed an additional $880 million in federal spending and tax incentives over five years to help disabled Americans with work, public access and new technology.</p>

        <p>Lazio's First Stock Options Paid a Handsome Return  Representative Rick A. Lazio's first foray into high-risk securities -- $2,300 for stock options on Quick &amp; Reilly, a brokerage house, in August 1997 -- yielded $16,000 in less than two weeks, a nearly 600 percent gain, on word of a possible takeover. A spokesman said Mr. Lazio, who was in his third term at the time, bought shares in the company earlier and had simply made a shrewd bet.</p>

        <p>More Arrests in Park Attacks  The police arrested six more men in the sex attacks in Central Park after the National Puerto Rican Day Parade on Sunday and identified more suspects in the frenzy of assaults that terrified parkgoers, embarrassed the city and prompted an internal police review. All told, eight men have been arrested in the assaults on dozens of women.</p>

        <p>Patrick J. Buchanan, a Republican seeking the Reform Party nomination for president, suggested that ''liberal cop-bashing'' by Hillary Rodham Clinton and others had encouraged the park attacks.</p>

        <p>Nile Virus Detected in Queens  City health officials said initial tests had shown that a chicken left in a coop in Corona, Queens, had been infected with the West Nile virus, and that if follow-up tests confirmed that finding, insecticide would be sprayed in the area next week.</p>
