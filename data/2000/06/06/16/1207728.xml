        <p>Insisting that he plans to withdraw from hands-on management of his huge hedge funds that once swung the world's markets, George Soros said today that a $6.5 billion fund to be introduced next month would seek lower returns and be run in part by outside money managers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Soros, whose Quantum Fund has been hit by the resignations of top managers and a flight of investors' cash, told reporters here that his Quantum Emerging Growth Fund would be merged with the Quantum Fund on July 1 to create the Quantum Endowment Fund. He described it in a letter to shareholders as ''a structure that will last beyond my lifetime.''</p>

        <p>Insisting that he plans to withdraw from hands-on management of his huge hedge funds that once swung the world's markets, George Soros said today that a $6.5 billion fund to be introduced next month would seek lower returns and be run in part by outside money managers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Soros, whose Quantum Fund has been hit by the resignations of top managers and a flight of investors' cash, told reporters here that his Quantum Emerging Growth Fund would be merged with the Quantum Fund on July 1 to create the Quantum Endowment Fund. He described it in a letter to shareholders as ''a structure that will last beyond my lifetime.''</p>
        <p>He said the new fund would be less leveraged than the Quantum Fund in its heyday, when Mr. Soros, the Hungarian-born financier, became known for coups like betting against the pound during the 1992 British financial crisis. The move reportedly netted Mr. Soros $1 billion.</p>
        <p>''In my old age I have become conservative,'' Mr. Soros, 69, told reporters here. ''I'll be happy if I average 15 percent rather than 31 percent.'' Historically, the Soros funds have averaged 32 percent returns from big, leveraged plays on bonds, commodities, currencies and stocks. He said that his new fund would rely less on borrowed money than in the past.</p>
        <p>Mr. Soros indicated that as he pulled back from day-to-day management to concentrate on philanthropic funds, his 36-year-old son, Robert, would adopt an increasingly central role in the family's financial empire. ''It would be a big mistake for me to go back into the ring,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Today's announcement comes after months of turmoil that began when two senior managers, Stanley Druckenmiller and Nicholas Roditi, left in April. Since March, assets in his funds have dropped to $11 billion from $19 billion as investors withdrew and technology stocks fell.</p>
        <p>Mr. Soros said he would put more of his money into more stable real estate and private equity. And, he said, roughly half the assets in the reorganized fund would be managed by up to 20 outsiders. The portfolio will be spread over real estate, ''macro'' bets using less borrowed money, private equity and stocks, which will account for half of the fund's assets, he said. The change will mean that about 100 Quantum Fund traders and money managers will lose their jobs.</p>
        <p>''The reorganization is almost done,'' Mr. Soros said.</p>
        <p>The changes have led some analysts to conclude that the Quantum Fund is far more a personal investment vehicle than in the past. Mr. Soros acknowledged today that ''outside money is probably less than 40 percent'' and said the reorganized fund ''fits my personal needs better than the previous one.''</p>
