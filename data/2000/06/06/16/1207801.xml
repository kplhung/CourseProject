      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Jeff Van Gundy, basketball coach of the Knicks, and Bobby Valentine, baseball manager of the Mets, have something in common. Each once worked for the same tough boss.</p>
        <p>Van Gundy was a graduate assistant at Providence College, minding a summer camp of high school kids one night while casually watching the Providence team in an informal practice. His athletic director, lurking within the gym that night, saw Van Gundy and scolded him for breaking a National Collegiate Athletic Association rule by watching college players at that time of year.</p>
        <p>''He told me that not knowing the rule was not acceptable,'' Van Gundy recalled. ''He made it emphatic and clear.''</p>
        <p>The same man managed Valentine's baseball team when Valentine was a 17-year-old amateur in the Cape Cod summer baseball league. Valentine was the only high school kid on a team of college players. So the manager took a special interest.</p>
        <p>''He was concerned about my nights, whether or not I was with the right people,'' Valentine recalled. On a road trip, when there were not enough seats in the car, Valentine's older teammates put him in the trunk. Their manager was not pleased. ''He was very upset about my lack of good judgment'' in allowing the older players to haze him in such a way, Valentine recalled. ''He gave me a responsibility lecture.''</p>
        <p>Their former boss is not now known for his prowess in basketball or baseball, but is nevertheless successful and important in sports. He is Lou Lamoriello, president and general manager of the Devils, the champions of the National Hockey League. With two Stanley Cup titles and three Eastern Conference championships in the last six seasons, he is one of the most successful executives in his business and his franchise has one of the best records among New York metropolitan area teams.</p>
        <p>In the near future, Lamoriello may well be working for a hockey/baseball/basketball corporation with a very tough boss. When the Devils are sold by John McMullen to with a very tough boss. When the Devils are sold by John McMullen to YankeeNets this summer, the man expected to have the most power in the new conglomerate will be George Steinbrenner, the principal owner of the Yankees. As it would happen, the teams in partnership with the Devils would compete directly with Van Gundy's Knicks and Valentine's Mets.</p>
        <p>But it is not a sure thing that Lamoriello will be a part of YankeeNets. Both he and Steinbrenner are strong-willed and demanding men, accustomed to winning and obsessed with control. While Steinbrenner can be bombastic, opinionated and meddlesome, Lamoriello is taciturn, secretive and restrained. Could Lamoriello work with such a man?</p>
        <p>He paused before answering.</p>
        <p>''I can't say I cannot because I don't know him,'' Lamoriello said. ''You have to look at the success he's had and you have to say there is something there.'' Lamoriello mentioned Yogi Berra, the former Yankees catcher and manager who recently repaired his relationship with Steinbrenner after a long estrangement.</p>
        <p>''Yogi is a good friend of mine,'' Lamoriello said. ''I see the relationship they have right now. Yogi is not a person to put himself in those positions unless he feels comfortable.'' He said he planned to meet with Steinbrenner and make his decision soon.</p>
        <p>An Eagle's Eye for Detail</p>
        <p>Lamoriello talked from behind a big desk in his office at Continental Arena. Above him was a big, circular window, its roundness in counterpoint to his balding head. Over Lamoriello's left shoulder, on a wall, was a picture and a quotation from Vince Lombardi with the title ''What It Takes to Be No. 1''</p>
        <p>Lamoriello is 57 years old, trim as an athlete, and energetic, with quick strides. He dresses in well-tailored dark suits and speaks with the accent of his native Providence, R.I.</p>
        <p>At Providence College, he was captain of both the hockey and baseball teams. After graduating, he was an assistant coach of both teams for four years and then coach of the hockey team for 15 more. And after five years as the school's athletic director, he joined the Devils in 1987.</p>
        <p>In conversation he makes direct, piercing eye contact. During the interview for this article, the telephones kept ringing and his secretary occasionally left messages on his desk. It was late afternoon and Lamoriello apologized for being three whole minutes late for the interview. Making people wait is not his style.</p>
        <p>Unlike many businesses in the year 2000, Lamoriello's office does not permit voice mail or e-mail. This is not to cut costs, although he never hesitates to save a dollar, but to achieve broader purposes.</p>
        <p>''I still think we are such a people business that a live voice can respond to everyone,'' Lamoriello said. ''You call here and that phone is answered within two rings. Doesn't that feel good?''</p>
        <p>Along with improving customer relations, Lamoriello said lack of voice mail keeps employees on their toes, near their desks, focused on their duties. His approach is reinforced, he said, when he calls other companies and gets the runaround through voice mail. ''I think we should keep a live voice,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But his critics might see this as evidence of small-mindedness, of Lamoriello's not seeing the forest for the trees. Despite the success of his team, the Devils rarely sell out their regular-season games and have a minor profile in the nation's largest market, virtually ignored by some major media outlets. After the Devils clinched the cup in Dallas last Saturday night, some fans said that they could not get information about the team's return when they called the Devils' office on Sunday.</p>
        <p>The team landed at Teeterboro Airport in Bergen County on Sunday afternoon and the cup was transported to the arena, with just a few fans present. What could have been a public relations bonanza -- great television video on a slow news day -- fizzled away. The official celebration, on Wednesday night in the arena parking lot, drew a crowd estimated at 45,000.</p>
        <p>When queried about his feel for marketing and public relations, Lamoriello expressed only a slight hint of uncertainty. For a suburban team this good, he was asked, is a rare sellout and low visibility the best it can do?</p>
        <p>''It's a good question,'' Lamoriello said. ''I don't have an answer to it. I don't want to use the word uncontrollable, but it's a good word. We've put the product forward as best we can. You hear people criticize marketing. Well, you can't have any better marketing than what just went on in the last 10 weeks. What can you do different?''</p>
        <p>That may be answered by Steinbrenner's ''hockey people'' after the  franchises are merged. The sale will bring Lamoriello at least several million dollars for his minority share of the hockey team, and he will become a free agent. Should he leave the Devils, his record in New Jersey would make him attractive to many teams.</p>
        <p>Louie's Famous Formula</p>
        <p>Lamoriello has several proteges around the N.H.L., including Dean Lombardi, general manager of the San Jose Sharks. When asked whether Lamoriello could work with Steinbrenner, Lombardi sighed and said, ''Geez,'' before contemplating the notion. Then he added: ''Steinbrenner is a smart businessman. Why mess with Louie's formula?''</p>
        <p>Lombardi said he learned ''Louie's formula'' late one night in 1996, when he took over the Sharks and found the franchise ''a mess, in so much turmoil, a wreck, the whole thing had blown up.'' Feeling lonely and perplexed after a game, Lombardi asked Lamoriello for a meeting. Lamoriello gave him three hours of information and a pep talk.</p>
        <p>''I'll never forget those guideposts,'' Lombardi said. '' 'Keep your focus. Suck it up. Stick to your guns.' He showed how his organizational chart was set up, who responds to who in situations of conflict.''</p>
        <p>Because Lamoriello often seems measured and cold, Lombardi said people overlook his softer side. Lamoriello is not a glad-hander, Lombardi said, ''who will walk into a room, shake your hand and look over your shoulder to see who else he can talk to.'' But he will devote his attention to you, listen and respond. ''He comes on close to the vest,'' Lombardi said. ''You hear about the regimented stuff. But he's all about substance. You've got a real friend.''</p>
        <p>Similar things were said by Rick Pitino, the president and head coach of the Boston Celtics, who coached for Lamoriello at Providence in the mid-1980's, when Van Gundy was a graduate assistant. When Pitino's son died six months after birth, Lamoriello arranged the funeral, including, Pitino said, ''which priests were on the altar.'' (Some of Lamoriello's closest friends are Dominican priests.) But Pitino also saw a secretive side of Lamoriello that some might find excessive and that Pitino found amusing.</p>
        <p>When he first interviewed for the Providence job, Pitino said, Lamoriello insisted that they meet at a hotel at midnight. They talked for three hours. Then Lamoriello wanted Pitino to see the facilities. ''Now?'' Pitino said, checking his watch. ''Yes,'' Lamoriello said. So they toured the gym between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m.</p>
        <p>''Under the cloak of darkness,'' Pitino said. ''The C.I.A. could not have found out where we were.'' But Pitino quickly added: ''I know the flip side of Lou. He is warm and gentle and loving.'' Three or four times a year, when things are getting particularly tough in Boston and the critics are finding fault, Pitino said he calls Lamoriello. And Lamoriello tells him: ''You're tough enough to take it. . . . Stick to your plans.''</p>
        <p>The Keeper of Tradition</p>
        <p>It is a philosophy Lamoriello practices with his Devils. ''We never look for excuses,'' Lamoriello said. ''We look for reasons. The fine line between winning and losing is no different than the fine line between kindness and weakness.''</p>
        <p>And what does that mean?</p>
        <p>''It's an expression I use,'' Lamoriello said. ''A lot of people cannot differentiate between kindness and weakness. Because a person is easygoing, they think he is weak. And vice versa. There is a fine line. And that fine line is very, very important.''</p>
        <p>The afternoon turned to evening and the conversation moved through many hockey topics. On the 2002 Olympics: Yes, Lamoriello would like another chance to manage the United States team and do better this time than he did in 1998, when the team was a disappointment on and off the ice in Nagano, Japan.</p>
        <p>On the low-scoring N.H.L. games and the rules: Don't make too many new rules, he said. Enforce the old ones. ''We had a game in here the other night, triple overtime, 0-0,'' Lamoriello said. ''Anyone who was critical of that game because the final score was 1-0, they are looking for something wrong. Fans were on the edge of their seats. You saw those two goaltenders! You saw the benches! You saw the anticipation! What more do you want? If you want more than that, it's not available.''</p>
        <p>On loud recorded music and video displays during games and his decision to bring an old-fashioned, live-organ sound back to his arena: ''As far as the entertainment around the game, don't let it become bigger than the game. That's why the organ came here. There is a proper mix. I am a traditionalist.''</p>
        <p>On the perception that he is vindictive and punitive toward players who challenge his authority and the policy of the team: ''I taught high school in my earlier years. Before you have respect, there has to be a little fear. Not fear in a detrimental way. Fear of what the end result might be. You have to have a little fear of your superiors. I am from the school that you do what's right, not what's politically correct. You have to have that little fear of your schoolteacher. Now, is that good? That is healthy.''</p>
        <p>On replacing Robbie Ftorek as coach with Larry Robinson with eight games remaining in the regular season and the Devils in first place: ''Very hard. Robbie is a good person and a friend. Robbie, in his own way, allowed some of our younger players to blossom. Gave them total freedom. And, sometimes, your greatest assets become your liabilities. They forgot about other things. The decision was made like every other decision. You have to separate your heart from your head.''</p>
        <p>On what makes his franchise unique: ''I go back to my background with a college team. Our veterans are our seniors. Our freshmen are our rookies. All of them have talent, all of them have humility. If there is something wrong, I want the veterans to be the ones to handle it. If a young player cannot understand why things are done, it's just like the freshman who is homesick. He wants to go home. The coach is mad at him. The senior will take him for a walk on campus and say, 'Listen, we've all gone through this.' ''</p>
        <p>On his uncharacteristic move of acquiring high-salaried veterans like Vladimir Malakhov and Alexander Mogilny right before the playoffs: ''The unknown is the most powerful thing. Sometimes, anyone's best asset is when people can't predict what you'll do.''</p>
        <p>He smiled, a look of satisfaction that made up in confidence and pride what it lacked in warmth and charm. When the tape recorder was shut off, he chatted a few more minutes, amiably but in generalities, asking for opinions and feedback. On or off the record, Lamoriello never leaks any secrets or gossip to any reporter. Some resent him for it, but most respect the consistency.</p>
        <p>Soon it was time for him to move on to other business. The phones were still ringing, but nobody answered them because the office staff had gone home. Lamoriello said goodbye, shook hands, put on his glasses, picked up a stack of messages and reached for the telephone.</p>
