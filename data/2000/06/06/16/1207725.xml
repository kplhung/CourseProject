        <p>On the To-Do List, Get a Manicure</p>
        <p>The soprano RENEE FLEMING has been invited to sing at BISHOP EDWARD M. EGAN'S installation as the Roman Catholic archbishop of New York. And, in contrast to her last encounter with the bishop, she will not have dirt under her fingernails this time.</p>

I'm good at that. I do not take an enormous amount of time getting glamorous. I can get ready in 10 minutes if I have to, and that night, I did. So we got there in time.''</p>

        <p>On the To-Do List, Get a Manicure</p>
        <p>The soprano RENEE FLEMING has been invited to sing at BISHOP EDWARD M. EGAN'S installation as the Roman Catholic archbishop of New York. And, in contrast to her last encounter with the bishop, she will not have dirt under her fingernails this time.</p>
        <p>She did when she met Bishop Egan last month at a concert at St. John the Evangelist, a Catholic church in Stamford, Conn. ''I'd been gardening, frantically planting perennials'' before the Saturday evening concert, she said, ''and my daughter had Kool-Aid stains on her mouth. But I'm a quick-change expert. I'm good at that. I do not take an enormous amount of time getting glamorous. I can get ready in 10 minutes if I have to, and that night, I did. So we got there in time.''</p>
        <p>Being Renee Fleming, she was seated next to the bishop. ''He'd seen 'Rosenkavalier' -- that's what we discussed,'' she said, referring to the Strauss opera in which she starred at the Metropolitan Opera last season. ''He is a huge opera fan, and he's a hugely charismatic, larger-than-life personality.''</p>
        <p>Later, Ms. Fleming said, a friend joked that Ms. Fleming would be asked to sing at midnight Mass on Christmas Eve ''if he didn't notice the dirt under the fingernails.'' The bishop did not wait until December. The call to sing at the installation came a couple of days later. The bishop asked that she sing two movements of the ''Exultate Jubilate'' by Mozart.</p>
        <p>Meet the Beetles At a Garden Party</p>
        <p>Beetles -- the winged, biting kind, not the Volkswagen variety -- got into the act at the Museum of Modern Art's annual Party in the Garden on Wednesday. They were not on the guest list, of course. But they were talked about as the museum's president, AGNES GUND, saluted DAVID ROCKEFELLER, the chairman emeritus, who turned 85 on Monday.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gund said that since childhood, Mr. Rockefeller had been a major beetle collector. She sounded as if she knew enough to be one, too, as she listed a number of beetle facts that mesmerized the almost 2,000 guests.</p>
        <p>''Every fifth living thing on this planet is a beetle,'' she said, adding, under her breath, ''And apparently every sixth living thing must be a friend or relative of David's.''</p>
        <p>Another factoid Ms. Gund mentioned: Mr. Rockefeller has a motorized Rolodex ''not unlike that of dry cleaners'' containing more than 100,000 names. (Of people, presumably, not different types of beetles.)</p>
        <p>Now he also has a music box replica of the museum's new building. It was a present from YOSHIO TANIGUCHI, the building's architect. It plays -- what else? -- ''Happy Birthday.''</p>
        <p>The garden party, which raised more than $1.3 million for the museum, was different from past gatherings: this time, striking employees were picketing across from the museum's main entrance on West 53rd Street near Fifth Avenue. The workers -- archivists, assistant curators, bookshop workers and other employees -- walked off their jobs April 29.</p>
        <p>Send Us Money, Forget the Speech</p>
        <p>The Republican National Committee sent a fund-raising pitch -- give $1,000 and attend the party's convention in Philadelphia, which begins on July 31 -- to former GOV. MARIO M. CUOMO.</p>
        <p>''This just proves that Governor Bush is the leader of the party of optimism,'' said MARK PFEIFLE, a G.O.P. spokesman, adding that he did not know how Mr. Cuomo -- the keynote speaker at the Democratic National Convention in 1984 -- wound up on a Republican mailing list.</p>
        <p>''Maybe I should go just for kicks,'' Mr. Cuomo said, ''if only on the theory that so many Republicans are trying to become Democrats, like Pataki and Lazio trying to creep over to the middle, and George W. They're like fallen-away Catholics who think they can reinstate themselves by putting two pennies in the poor box.''</p>
