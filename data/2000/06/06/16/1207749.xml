        <p>In the brokerage business, the climb to the top ranks of management almost always started from a stockbroker's desk in a local branch. But, suddenly, the route to the top has been diverted through business schools and investment bankers' offices on Wall Street.</p>
        <p>Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &amp; Company said yesterday that it had chosen John Schaefer, a longtime investment banker to run its brokerage operation, the second largest in the country.

        <p>In the brokerage business, the climb to the top ranks of management almost always started from a stockbroker's desk in a local branch. But, suddenly, the route to the top has been diverted through business schools and investment bankers' offices on Wall Street.</p>
        <p>Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &amp; Company said yesterday that it had chosen John Schaefer, a longtime investment banker to run its brokerage operation, the second largest in the country. The appointment came a few months after the biggest brokerage firm, Merrill Lynch &amp; Company, named another former investment banker, E. Stanley O'Neal, to run its brokerage network.</p>
        <p>Like Mr. O'Neal, Mr. Schaefer is the first person to hold his new job who never was a stockbroker. The similarities do not end there. Both men are 48 and each has a master's degree in business administration from Harvard Business School.</p>
        <p>''It's not about rewarding the most senior broker any more,'' said Richard Strauss, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company. ''We're past that stage. It's about getting the most strategic thinker in place. Things are changing so quickly in the brokerage business, there's no room for error.''</p>
        <p>At the heart of the changes is Internet technology, which ushered in cheap, online stock trading and led investors to question why they were paying commissions of $200 or more to place trades through brokers. Morgan Stanley and Merrill both capitulated last year and, over the objections of their armies of brokers, introduced online trading with commissions as low as $29.95.</p>
        <p>The integration of new technology into Morgan Stanley's various businesses has been Mr. Schaefer's primary focus as the firm's chief strategic and administrative officer for the last two years. He also is the co-chairman of a committee that oversees the firm's investments in electronic securities exchanges and other areas of electronic commerce.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schaefer, who was not available for comment, succeeds James F. Higgins as president and chief operating officer of the firm's private client group. Mr. Higgins, 52, is assuming the title of chairman of the group, which was the Dean Witter brokerage firm before Dean Witter merged with the Morgan Stanley investment banking firm in 1997.</p>
        <p>Mr. Higgins, who has run the brokerage operation for 12 years, also was not available for comment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schaefer inherits a group of more than 13,000 brokers who have been wrestling with the merger of self-service investing with their traditional service of personally advising clients on how to manage their money. Last year, after operating its online-trading service as a separate division under the brand name of its Discover credit card, Morgan Stanley renamed it Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Online and folded it in with the rest of the firm's brokerage operations.</p>
        <p>Morgan Stanley announced that shift with great fanfare, a step ahead of Merrill Lynch's introduction of online trading, but Morgan Stanley has guarded information about how well its online service has been received.</p>
        <p>Dean Witter could have had a big head start online against its Wall Street competitors. It was the first to experiment with trading over the Internet when it bought Lombard Brokerage, a small San Francisco-based online brokerage firm, in 1996 for about $60 million. But Mr. Higgins and other Dean Witter executives feared the reaction of the firm's brokers to the new threat and as a result did not embrace the new technology.</p>
        <p>Eric Roach, who founded Lombard and helped run Dean Witter's online business until earlier this year, said Mr. Schaefer's experience in dealing with new technology made him an ideal choice to succeed Mr. Higgins. ''He really gets it,'' said Mr. Roach, the chief executive of an Internet start-up called eLance.com. ''He's a great leader. He's absolutely direct. He's opinionated but he listens.''</p>
        <p>Dean Witter's brokers historically have been less productive than their competitors at Merrill Lynch and the Salomon Smith Barney unit of Citigroup, analysts said. Some analysts believe that lag results in part from Dean Witter's reluctance to open its sales network to products, like mutual funds, from other companies. While other brokerage firms are struggling to get their brokers to sell their own funds, as many as 70 percent of the funds sold by Dean Witter brokers are their own funds.</p>
