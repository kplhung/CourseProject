        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Michael Beschloss (Op-Ed, June 11) asserts that Adlai Stevenson ''could go quite happily for months or years without picking up a book'' and that ''on the nightstand, on the day he died, was but a single volume -- the Social Register.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps at times Stevenson could have gone a few months without reading a book because there were campaigns to wage. But to suggest that years passed before he read a book is wrong. I know this as a fact, having been associated with him for more than 15 years.</p>
        <p>As for the Social Register, John Bartlow Martin, in his biography of Stevenson, said that he had catalogued Stevenson's library in Illinois, and that at that time ''on the night table beside his bed lay a book -- the Social Register.''</p>
        <p>Martin noted this about six months after Stevenson's death in London, and it is hardly significant or indicative of anything, since he probably used it to find the telephone numbers of friends.</p>
        <p>WILLIAM MC C. BLAIR JR.  Washington, June 12, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer was Adlai Stevenson's administrative assistant from 1950 to 1952 and his law partner from 1952 to 1960.</p>
