        <p>Asked about his training regimen, Oscar De La Hoya put on his celebrity pose, stroked his chin and playfully tweaked his pretty boy image.</p>

        <p>Asked about his training regimen, Oscar De La Hoya put on his celebrity pose, stroked his chin and playfully tweaked his pretty boy image.</p>
        <p>''It's the most perfect camp I ever had,'' he said. ''I'm in the best shape of my life and I've been eating good foods. And my face comes out better on the camera when I'm on a great diet.''</p>
        <p>Looking good has never been more of an issue with De La Hoya, the reigning World Boxing Council welterweight champion, who has vowed a makeover in ring substance and style since losing to Felix Trinidad last September. Nine months later, the only loss of De La Hoya's career (32-1, 26 knockouts) carries significant weight in his title defense Saturday night against Shane Mosley (34-0, 32 knockouts) at the Staples Center.</p>
        <p>Can De La Hoya reverse the damage to his reputation caused when he dodged Trinidad in the last three rounds and cost himself a victory in the biggest fight of his career?</p>
        <p>De La Hoya has since tried spin control, offering injury and poor judges' scoring as excuses for failing to protect and increase his early lead against Trinidad. Heading into this year, he declared he would fight four times and win each by knockout.</p>
        <p>''That's my goal, and I'm standing behind it,'' De La Hoya said. ''It's made me refocus and dedicate myself. It's a lot of pressure on me, but that's what I believe I'm going to do.''</p>
        <p>In February, De La Hoya warmed to his prediction by stopping Derrell Coley in the seventh round. Now, he has to use his fists instead of his mouth against a dangerous opponent who is on a higher level than Coley and just as quick as De La Hoya.</p>
        <p>''I can bang with anybody; that's not a problem,'' De La Hoya said of Mosley. ''That's what we trained for, going forward and throwing a lot of hard punches and combinations. Attack, attack, attack.</p>
        <p>''I don't think I'm going to show my boxing skills the way I did with Trinidad. I will be more explosive and aggressive. I think it will be a fight with a lot of fast, early action.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, De La Hoya knows he must put on a good show for his hometown fans to dispel the notion that he has traded his roots for celebrity status. De La Hoya, who is expected to receive $8 million for fighting Mosley, reportedly is building a house in Beverly Hills, and Wednesday night was a guest on ''The Tonight Show'' with Jay Leno.</p>
        <p>Mosley sensed the shift in De La Hoya's fan support during a photo shoot shortly after their title bout was announced. If the fact that the session was for Uppercut magazine, a publication partly owned by De La Hoya, wasn't curious enough, Mosley was asked to pose along Whittier Boulevard -- in the shadow of De La Hoya's old neighborhood -- under a sign that reads ''Welcome to East Los Angeles.''</p>
        <p>''It was less than one mile from where he used to live,'' said Mosley, who is from Pomona. ''It was around 6 in the morning, and some people came by and said: 'Yeah, Shane, go get Oscar! Beat him up!' ''</p>
        <p>De La Hoya said: ''You can't have everybody like you. If 5 percent of the people don't like you, you still have 95 percent of your fan base. For an athlete that's on top of his game, it's always going to be that way. A lot of times, people of your own race are against you and don't want you to win. That's just the way people are.''</p>
        <p>Mosley, the former lightweight champion, thought De La Hoya beat Trinidad.</p>
        <p>''I don't know if he was hurt that bad or just trying to protect his lead,'' Mosley said. ''He outpointed Trinidad, but he could have done a better job.''</p>
        <p>Mosley added: ''Oscar would be better off fighting a toe-to-toe fight and not running around. I don't think the fans would appreciate that from him again.''</p>
