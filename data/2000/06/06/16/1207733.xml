        <p>Al Leiter curls his hands into an upside-down ''U'' and places them just above his eyes. This is the view he used to have when he stood on the pitcher's mound.</p>
        <p>Slowly, Leiter separates his hands. The view broadens, revealing probing, challenging eyes, and his hands keep moving in opposite directions. This is how the Mets' left-hander sees things now. In his 14th major league season, Leiter sees it all.</p>
        <p>''He was always a tunnel-vision type of pitcher,'' catcher Mike Piazza said. ''Now, he's starting to understand that it's more than just throwing hard cutters and sliders.''</p>
        <p>Leiter, who will start for the Mets in Milwaukee on Friday, is 7-1 this season, three victories short of his 100th, a milestone he would have reached long ago if not for injuries early in his career. Years of planes, buses and hotels have made baseball seem more like a job, except when he is pitching. Pitching keeps getting more fun.</p>
        <p>''I have such a better idea,'' Leiter said. ''When I had the stuff the scouts loved, I looked in there, and when a guy hit a ball a certain way and hit it foul, I wasn't real sure if he was on it or if he wasn't on it, if it was a good pitch or a bad pitch. Now, I see it.''</p>
        <p>That understanding has made him smarter on the mound, and the more he learns, the more he wants to know.</p>
        <p>Mike Hampton, the No. 1 starter in his first year with the Mets, has seen Leiter staring at videotape, looking for any kind of weakness he can find in an opposing hitter. Hampton asked Leiter how that changed his approach, and Leiter said it did not. But one pitch a hitter cannot handle could be important.</p>
        <p>''I'm like: 'Dude, I'm going to stay with my strengths, sinkers away, cutters in, changeups. If I get a weak hitter or someone that I want to show a curveball, I'll do that,' '' Hampton said. ''But he's like, 'Just that one thing might help you win the game.' It kind of gets you thinking. You never have all the answers.''</p>
        <p>Leiter never thought he did, but sometimes he pitched that way. With the Yankees in the late 1980's and the Blue Jays in the early 90's, he was surrounded by veteran pitchers whose advice he understood but sometimes could not execute.</p>
        <p>He has taken the best lessons and applied them to his game. David Cone, a teammate of his with Toronto in 1992, taught him to prepare quickly before each inning because umpires appreciate when a pitcher is ready. The next year, Leiter watched a declining Jack Morris, who still prowled the clubhouse on the days he pitched with a look that said he could not be beaten.</p>
        <p>Leiter shared that lesson with Glendon Rusch, the 25-year-old left-hander who had sometimes looked defeated when he struggled early in his career. Hampton is more accomplished that Rusch, but he is only 27 and said he also looks to Leiter for guidance.</p>
        <p>''He prepares himself for his start more than anybody I've played with before,'' Hampton said. ''I really enjoy watching him play the game.''</p>
        <p>Leiter has evolved as he teaches. Over the years, he would watch pitchers with inferior stuff enjoy much more success because they used both sides of the plate and changed speeds. He also noticed how some pitchers with better fastballs struggled because they threw nothing else.</p>
        <p>Leiter decided to stick with his strengths -- but not always. His fastball is still hard, but not quite what it once was, and he is more willing to surprise hitters, even with change ups, when he is behind in the count. Piazza said he called pitches now that he never would have called for Leiter two years ago.</p>
        <p>''The reality is, look, I can't throw it by everybody,'' Leiter said. ''I have to pitch. You have to get to that point in your career where you feel good enough to trust that it works.</p>
        <p>''I am not the least bit ashamed that I had to throw Jimmy Leyritz a 3-2 slider the other day in the sixth inning,'' he said, referring to a strikeout pitch against the Yankees' designated hitter in a 12-2 victory last Friday. ''Years ago I never would have thrown a 3-2 slider. I wouldn't want to walk him, so I'd overthrow a fastball and throw it high for a ball.''</p>
        <p>Lots of strikeouts, lots of walks. That was the old Leiter. After a 1-0 victory over Tampa Bay two starts ago, Leiter said his performance reminded himself of the pitcher he once was. He threw 123 pitches before he was replaced in the seventh, walking five and striking out eight.</p>
        <p>But he was referring only to the numbers, not to the way he pitched. His best stuff had abandoned him, so he tried curveballs and changeups instead of persisting with the hard, inside pitches. He walked one hitter four times, but he was the right one to walk -- Greg Vaughn, Tampa Bay's powerful left fielder.</p>
        <p>It was not a masterpiece, but it was a victory, proof that older and wiser can be a winning combination. For Leiter this season, it has worked most of the time.</p>
        <p>''I'm feeling much better now, as a pitcher, than ever,'' he said.</p>
