        <p>With the current New York legislative session  limping toward a close, negotiators in Albany are focusing on key issues where action should be possible before adjournment next week. Ballot reform and gun control are of critical importance.</p>
        <p>In April, with the memory still fresh of the ballot-rigging that nearly prevented Senator John McCain from competing in the state's presidential primary, the State Senate approved remedial legislation offered by one of the chief architects of that debacle, Gov. George Pataki. The measure would automatically place all recognized G.O.P. candidates on the primary ballot.</p>
        <p>The bill contains a disappointing provision that would turn the Republican presidential primary into a winner-take-all contest, and it fails to address Democratic Party procedures. But that is no excuse for the lack of interest shown so far by the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver. He needs to seize this rare opportunity to ensure that New York's voters have a wider choice of candidates.</p>
        <p>Last-minute maneuvering will also decide the fate of the constructive gun control package that Mr. Pataki introduced in March. The Senate, which is usually allergic to gun controls, would probably be forced to go along if the governor and the Assembly can agree on a bill. The governor's package includes a ban on assault weapons, background checks for guns purchased at gun shows, raising the age for purchasing guns from 18 to 21, ballistics fingerprinting of all new guns to make them easier to trace, and a requirement that gun dealers provide a trigger lock with every gun sale. The bill should be strengthened by requiring built-in trigger locks and including penalties for those who fail to store their weapons safely.</p>
