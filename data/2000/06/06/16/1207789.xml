        <p>'Female Allegories of America'</p>

        <p>Uncle Sam, the allegorical male representative of the United States, has always had a female counterpart, the damsel dressed in flowing robes who came to symbolize Liberty. Back in the 16th century, when mapmakers drew their post-Columbus versions of the world, she was L'Amerique, an Indian princess with feathers in her hair, an emblem of one of the Four Continents. By the late 18th century she had evolved into Columbia, the daughter of England's Britannia and France's revolutionary Marianne, and then into the matronly Lady Liberty we know today.</p>
        <p>As a sequel to its ''Uncle Sam'' show last year, the New-York Historical Society has mounted a very lively display of his iconic sister in her many guises. Posters, cartoons, illustrations, advertisements, sheet music covers, photographs and consumer products tell the story of Liberty's evolution. In a busy 16th-century French etching, ''Geographia Blauiana,'' the green-gowned symbol  appears in a chariot as cherubs fly above her; in a 1988 lithograph by Saul Steinberg she is seen in a feathered headdress admiring the Chrysler Building.</p>

        <p>As a sequel to its ''Uncle Sam'' show last year, the New-York Historical Society has mounted a very lively display of his iconic sister in her many guises. Posters, cartoons, illustrations, advertisements, sheet music covers, photographs and consumer products tell the story of Liberty's evolution. In a busy 16th-century French etching, ''Geographia Blauiana,'' the green-gowned symbol  appears in a chariot as cherubs fly above her; in a 1988 lithograph by Saul Steinberg she is seen in a feathered headdress admiring the Chrysler Building.</p>
        <p>The Statue of Liberty, by the French sculptor Frederic-Auguste Bartholdi, was installed in New York Harbor in 1886 and soon took on the status of an official national image. Other wonderful ''Liberty'' interpretations in the show range from an 1884 cartoon in Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper that shows the statue a thousand years later as a withered old crone seated on a rock, torch drooping into the water, to an anticipatory 1883 photograph, ''Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt as 'Electric Light' at the Vanderbilt Ball,'' showing the redoubtable society matron garbed as the lady of Bedloes Island.</p>
        <p>The show is rich, too, in pertinent material in which the female symbol takes an auxiliary role, like the 1788 Fragonard etching celebrating the achievements of Benjamin Franklin as a statesman and a 1914 cartoon by Joseph Keppler Jr. derogating J. P. Morgan's bequest of art to the Metropolitan Museum on the ground that his money came from shady dealings. (Liberty holds her torch to illuminate his bust.)</p>
        <p>Anyway, ''The Changing Face of Liberty'' abounds in treasures like these. And the amazing thing is that to assemble it the society had only to reach into its own capacious bins. As New York's most illustrious attic, it keeps our past alive.</p>
