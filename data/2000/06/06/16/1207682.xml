      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>SAINT ETIENNE: ''Sound of Water'' (Sub Pop). ''Sail away, sail away,'' Sarah Cracknell of Saint Etienne coos in ''How We Used to Live,'' the nine-minute mini-suite that sums up ''Sound of Water'' as it drifts between distant, unhappy memories and persistent hope. For a decade, Saint Etienne has been leavening pop songs with dance-club rhythms, coolly observing how far astray passion and ambition can lead. The band's fifth unified album, ''Sound of Water,'' floats above the fray; its songs yearn for escape and sanctuary. Saint Etienne collaborated with the minimalist German electronic group To Rococo Rot and with Sean O'Hagan, the Beach Boys idolator from the High Llamas. The few uptempo songs are skeletal and abstracted, transparently displaying their underlying patterns of clicks and blips and nonsense pop syllables, while the ballads sway between two chords like Brian Wilson in a hammock. Saint Etienne remains fascinated with pop construction, but has moved past cleverness and easy ironies. Its songs are no longer puzzles; they're atmospheric, self-contained worlds.</p>
