        <p>President Clinton is likely to name Robert L. Mallett, the deputy commerce secretary, to replace William M. Daley as acting secretary as a result of the announcement that Mr. Daley would lead the Gore campaign, an administration official said tonight.</p>
        <p>The official said the White House chief of staff, John D. Podesta convened a meeting this afternoon to begin discussing candidates to replace Mr. Daley for  the six months remaining in Mr. Clinton's term.</p>
        <p>The official said that the White House had not made a final decision whether Mr. Mallett would be formally nominated to succeed Mr. Daley but that he was on a short list of candidates.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Mallett ranks as the No. 2 official at the department, he keeps a relatively low profile. He is perhaps best known for his work on developing trade ties with Africa and working on disease prevention and poverty relief there. He also helps oversee the department's many agencies, including the Census Bureau and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p>
        <p>A 1979 graduate of Morehouse College, Mr. Mallett attended Harvard Law School and later worked as legal counsel to former Senator Lloyd M. Bentsen of Texas and as deputy mayor of the Washington city government.</p>
