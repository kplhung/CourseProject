        <p>In an often-turbulent debate yesterday over New York City's proposal for the largest rent rise in four years, tenants demanded a freeze while landlords called for an even bigger increase. The two sides squared off at the Rent Guidelines Board's annual hearing, which lasted all day and into the night.</p>
        <p>The board has proposed a 4 percent increase for one-year leases and 6 percent for two-year leases for the  million apartments covered by rent-stabilization laws. Its final vote will come on Thursday.</p>
        <p>Board officials repeatedly shouted for order as the tenant-dominated audience at Cooper Union burst into applause and cheers for its speakers and frequently jeered and booed landlord representatives. The lively crowd ebbed and flowed in size from a couple of dozen people to a few hundred.</p>
        <p>''I'm running this meeting, not you, sir,'' the board's chairman, Edward S. Hochman, said as he reined in one advocate at the microphone.</p>
        <p>Several tenants were removed for disrupting the hearings. The evening session was recessed for 15 minutes by a disruption when the police, who were ordered to remove one woman, ended up in a shoving and pulling match with several other people in the aisle. Four people, two men and two women, were arrested and charged with disorderly conduct.</p>
        <p>The first to be ejected, in the afternoon, was a white-haired woman who got in the last words as police officers escorted her out. Turning her face back to the board, she said, ''Shame on you!''</p>
        <p>City Councilman Stephen DiBrienza got into a brief shouting match with the board as he sympathized with the renters' emotions. ''I find shockingly offensive the level of police presence,'' he said, referring to the several officers in the auditorium. ''These are tenants, not terrorists.''</p>
        <p>Strong feelings and vivid oratory are hallmarks of the rent hearings.</p>
        <p>''I'm disabled, but I don't feel any different from any tenants, because all tenants in this city are disabled,''  Bill Hunter of Manhattan said.</p>
        <p>Davidson Garrett, who lives in a single-room-occupancy hotel in Chelsea, told the nine-member board, ''Our rooms are half the size of the table you're sitting at.''</p>
        <p>Pleading for the owners of small buildings, Jimmy Silber said, ''These are the owners that provide the best housing in New York.'' He said that past rent increases had left those properties struggling. ''The owners took it on the chin,'' he said. ''Please do not punish the small-property owners.''</p>
        <p>The board's final vote usually follows its original recommendation. The authorized increases will cover leases renewed between Sept. 30, 2000, and Oct. 1, 2001.</p>
        <p>For five of the last six years, the board has reflected the low-inflation era by adopting 2 percent rises for one-year leases and 4 percent for two-year leases. The exception, after a sharp rise in fuel oil prices, was 5 percent for one-year leases and 7 percent for two-year leases in 1996.  The current surge in fuel oil prices is the major factor behind the pending rent increase.</p>
        <p>''Many property owners still owe money for last year's fuel costs,'' said Jack Freund, executive vice president of the city's major landlord group, the Rent Stabilization Association. ''They are deeply troubled how to pay the bills.'' He added that the proposed rent increase was not enough to cover projected fuel costs. ''And every day, the price of oil heads higher and higher,'' Mr. Freund said.</p>
        <p>Another landlord advocate, Dan Margulies, executive director of the Community Housing Improvement Program, complained that owners were also burdened by the costs of various added regulations on lead paint, facade inspections and fire safety.</p>
        <p>But a tenant representative on the board, Jeffrey Coleman, argued that landlords had already benefited from past rent increases above their actual costs and that higher rents based on the last oil price increase were never rolled back after the prices dropped. Citing a staff study of city tax records, he said, ''Landlord profits surged 11 percent last year.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Coleman added that ''nothing takes into account the skyrocketing value of property'' in the current real estate market. One tenant from Queens, Ida Pollack, said: ''This is a show, a circus. I have been coming here for 20 years, and all I can say is bring in the clowns.'' At that point, however, there were still more than 100 speakers registered to speak.</p>
