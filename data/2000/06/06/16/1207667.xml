        <p>AS it asking too much to expect that someone would spend $70,000 to $100,000 for a lump of brown clay with four wheels?</p>
        <p>A life-size, two-ton clay model of the Volkswagen New Beetle (the real thing sells for $16,000 or so) went on the auction block at Christie's last week.</p>
        <p>And it stayed there.</p>
        <p>Only a few people bid on the clay model, which was part of Christie's 20th century decorative arts sale, and those bids failed to reach critical mass.</p>
        <p>''We had a few bids and they got close to our minimum bid requirement,'' Margaret Doyle, a Christie's spokeswoman, said. ''But it didn't sell. We are disappointed. A lot of people looked at it when it was on display in our gallery. It stood out, that's for sure.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Doyle would not divulge the minimum bid requirement; the sale catalog listed it at about $70,000.</p>
        <p>No full-size clay auto models are known to have been auctioned, Christie's said. More typically, the clay is reused or destroyed during the process of measuring for molds used in production.</p>
        <p>The clay model will return to the Volkswagen Design Center in Wolfsburg, Germany, where it was produced in 1995.</p>
