        <p>Glen Sather, the Rangers' president and general manager, is going through his list of prospective coaches, probably even checking it twice. But Sather said yesterday that one high-profile, would-be candidate had better call him if he wanted Sather to respond.</p>
        <p>This week Mike Keenan, who in 1994 coached the Rangers to their first Stanley Cup championship since 1940, again indicated that he was extremely interested in the job. Keenan also said that his representative, Rob Campbell, had twice attempted to contact Sather.</p>
        <p>When asked yesterday if Keenan was on his list of candidates, Sather said, I would think that if he was interested in the job, he would call me on his own.</p>
        <p>I will, Keenan said yesterday afternoon. I'd love to coach in New York again.</p>
        <p>Sather confirmed two names on his list: John Paddock and Walt Kyle. Paddock, a former coach and general manager with the Winnipeg Jets/Phoenix Coyotes, coached the Rangers' top minor league affiliate, the Hartford Wolf Pack, to a Calder Cup championship this season, signifying supremacy in the American Hockey League.</p>
        <p>Kyle coached the Edmonton Oilers' top minor league affiliate in Hamilton, Ontario, and remains friends with Sather, who left the Oilers' organization last month after 24 years.</p>
        <p>It is doubtful, however, that Sather would ask Mark Messier, the captain of the 1994 Rangers, to become his player-coach if the Vancouver Canucks did not pick up the option on Messier's contract by July 1.</p>
