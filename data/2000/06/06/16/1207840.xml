        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Police Release Photos of 7 Men Sought in Melee'' (news article, June 15), about the mob assault in Central Park last weekend:</p>
        <p>The fear of violence against us is something that all women live with their entire lives. As the mother of three daughters and a survivor of rape, I have had to teach my daughters constantly to be aware of their own vulnerability.</p>
        <p>This is not an enjoyable task. The need for such an awareness frequently permeates what should be a relaxing walk in the park on a Sunday afternoon or a sense of freedom about growing up and being safe.  Women are not safe, and last Sunday's rampage and violation are the perfect example of how women are viewed by many men in our society and culture.</p>
        <p>I hope that a large protest will be organized. This incident has served to re-inflame me, and I want my voice to be heard and my person to be seen along with all the other women in this city, country and the world who have been offended.</p>
        <p>JANE BERGER  New York, June 15, 2000</p>
