        <p>To see Irina Dvorovenko and Maxim Belotserkovsky step into the leading roles of American Ballet Theater's ''Swan Lake'' on Wednesday afternoon at the Metropolitan Opera House was to see two outstanding dancers outdo themselves and enhance a 19th-century classic with a splendid and mature performance. Kevin McKenzie's new version, seen first in May, has some idiosyncratic touches. In Act I the Polonaise music for aristocrats goes to jolly peasants, and Prince Siegfried is pictured as a wallflower.</p>
        <p>Above all, the accent is on dramatic incident woven into swiftly moving detail. It is up to the principals to bring depth to the plot through their dancing. This is what Ms. Dvorovenko and Mr. Belotserkovsky did with unusual technical polish. It allowed their performance a flow of movement with emotional nuance absorbed into the dancing and then conveyed to the audience. Nothing resembled a set piece, performed apart from the rest of the ballet.</p>

        <p>To see Irina Dvorovenko and Maxim Belotserkovsky step into the leading roles of American Ballet Theater's ''Swan Lake'' on Wednesday afternoon at the Metropolitan Opera House was to see two outstanding dancers outdo themselves and enhance a 19th-century classic with a splendid and mature performance. Kevin McKenzie's new version, seen first in May, has some idiosyncratic touches. In Act I the Polonaise music for aristocrats goes to jolly peasants, and Prince Siegfried is pictured as a wallflower.</p>
        <p>Above all, the accent is on dramatic incident woven into swiftly moving detail. It is up to the principals to bring depth to the plot through their dancing. This is what Ms. Dvorovenko and Mr. Belotserkovsky did with unusual technical polish. It allowed their performance a flow of movement with emotional nuance absorbed into the dancing and then conveyed to the audience. Nothing resembled a set piece, performed apart from the rest of the ballet.</p>
        <p>Coherence was the touchstone of this performance. Mr. Belotserkovsky was a lyrical prince, always in character but able to land perfectly in arabesque after a double turn in the air. Ms. Dvorovenko's Odette was hypnotic, giving full shape to her adagio and solo in Act II. Unlike others, her Odile did not simplify the choreography in the solo, and her attitude turns had a striking amplitude. The same security allowed her to keep the form of the choreography throughout the performance and to whip off her dazzling fouettes, ending in a triple.</p>
        <p>Just promoted as principals at Ballet Theater, Ms. Dvorovenko and Mr. Belotserkovsky have worked to remold themselves as dancers. Trained at the Kiev Ballet school in Ukraine, they were gifted from the start at Ballet Theater. But Ms. Dvorovenko has now stretched her strong calf muscles into a lean silhouette, and her original flashiness has been channeled into a refined style without loss of steely technique. Always a noble dancer, Mr. Belotserkovsky has now acquired the powerful technique he previously lacked. Together they are a stunning and exciting partnership.</p>
        <p>In this perfect ''Swan Lake,'' credit must also go to the coaching of Irina Kolpakova, the former Kirov ballerina who has clearly set these dancers on the right course.</p>
        <p>How to keep the production's interpolated and traditional dances from turning into a series of set pieces was a problem that Paloma Herrera, a new Odette-Odile with Julio Bocca, did not solve on Tuesday night. Unity in a 19th-century role does not come easily to her. Nonetheless her Odette had a touching vulnerability, and her fouettes as Odile were as excellent as ever. The task before her was to achieve continuity in a role, to cease turning the choreography into a series of steps, as in her blurred entrechats at the end of Act II. In Act III her Odile was a childlike temptress playing games, and technique was imperfect. Mr. Bocca, clearly having an off night, showed little of the classical silhouette expected.</p>
        <p>Among the soloists on Wednesday afternoon Joaquin De Luz and Herman Cornejo, an exceptionally talented 19-year-old, brought impeccable dazzle to Mr. McKenzie's virtuosic Neapolitan Dance, while the Pas de Trois in Act I sparkled with Sascha Radetsky, with his clean technique, flanked by Stella Abrera and Gillian Murphy.</p>
