        <p>House Republicans, warned by one of their pollsters that the prescription drug issue could cost them their majority in November, are following his script for defusing the issue almost word for word.</p>
        <p>A memorandum from the pollster, distributed to the Republicans at their caucus last week, suggested ''phrases that work'' on the issue, including: ''Too many senior citizens are forced to choose between putting food on the table and being able to afford the prescription drugs they need to stay alive. In our great nation, this is morally wrong.''</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, announcing the Republican drug plan for government-approved and subsidized private insurance plans, Speaker J. Dennis Hastert said: ''In fact, too many senior citizens and disabled Americans are forced to choose between putting food on the table and being able to afford the prescription drugs they need to stay alive. In our great nation, this is morally wrong.''</p>
        <p>At a House hearing that day, Representative Bill Archer of Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said, ''I really hope we can proceed on this very, very important issue without turning it into a political issue.'' The Republican leadership wants the bill voted on before the July 4 recess.</p>
        <p>But five days earlier the pollster, Glen Bolger of Public Opinion Strategies, a Virginia firm, warned the House Republican Conference that the prescription drug issue was a political problem for Republicans. While the Republican Party has strong messages on other important issues aside from drugs, ''Democrats enjoy a huge generic advantage as the party best perceived as being able to handle this issue,'' Mr. Bolger's memorandum said.</p>
        <p>However the issue may affect Congressional candidates, prescription drugs were the subject last week of Vice President Al Gore's first national television commercial, which portrayed the prospective Democratic presidential nominee as ''fighting for a prescription drug benefit.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bolger advised the Republican House members in the memorandum that the issue was ''very important'' to swing voters, including ''rural residents, rural women, white women, South residents, New England residents, women, working women, homemakers, age 55-64, age 65 plus, women 18-34, 60-plus retired women.''</p>
        <p>He cited polls by others showing that only 20 percent of Americans said Republicans would do a better job ''helping elderly Americans get access to affordable prescription drugs,'' while 53 percent said Democrats would do better. Based on focus groups he conducted for the National Republican Congressional Committee, Mr. Bolger wrote that people felt ''Republicans aren't doing anything for seniors'' and that ''upset seniors don't believe politicians (especially Republicans) understand how important and concerning this issue is to them.''</p>
        <p>He offered this advice, ''It is more important to communicate that you have a plan as it is to communicate what is in the plan.''</p>
        <p>The pollster warned Republicans to beware of and answer potential Democratic attacks like: ''Republicans are in the back pocket of H.M.O.'s, insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies. Republicans are out to protect the special interests, not the real interests of senior citizens.''</p>
        <p>Wednesday Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, who had a copy of Mr. Bolger's material, said at the White House, ''The House Republicans have cynically cloaked in pollster-provided rhetoric a prescription drug plan that benefits insurance and drug companies far more than it benefits seniors without drug coverage.''</p>
        <p>But most of Mr. Bolger's advice dealt with how to sell the issue, and his clients were plainly listening or reading.</p>
        <p>He suggested that Republicans say of their plan, ''By making it available to everyone, we're making sure that no senior citizen or disabled American falls through the cracks.''</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, Representative Roscoe G. Bartlett of Maryland told the House, ''By providing prescription drug coverage for everyone, Republicans want to make sure that no senior citizen or disabled American falls through the cracks.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bolger's memorandum said ''seniors like the idea of a voluntary plan'' and repeatedly urged Republicans to stress that their plan was ''affordable.'' Representative J. C. Watts Jr. of Oklahoma, chairman of the Republican caucus, told the House: ''Our plan is voluntary. It is also affordable and available to all.'' Representative Sam Johnson of Texas said the Republican plan provided ''coverage for all, and it is coverage that will be affordable and available for all seniors.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Representatives Bartlett, Watts, Johnson and Curt Weldon of Pennsylvania all cited the food-versus-prescription-drugs problem.</p>
        <p>But no one followed the Bolger script more earnestly than Mr. Hastert.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bolger suggested, ''Our plan protects low-income seniors by giving them prescription drug coverage, and offers ALL other seniors a number of affordable options to best meet their needs and protect them from financial ruin.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hastert said, ''Our plan not only protects low-income seniors who lack prescription drug coverage, it also offers ALL others a number of affordable options to best meet their needs and protect them from financial ruin.''</p>
        <p>The pollster wrote: ''A stronger Medicare with prescription drug coverage is a promise of health security and financial security for older Americans, and we're working to ensure that promise is kept. America's seniors deserve no less.''</p>
        <p>The speaker said: ''Strengthening Medicare and providing prescription drug coverage is a promise of health security and financial security for older Americans, and we're working to ensure that promise is kept. Our senior citizens and disabled Americans deserve no less.'''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bolger said this afternoon that he was happy to see that his advice had been taken.</p>
