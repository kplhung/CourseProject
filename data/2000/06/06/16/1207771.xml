        <p>Perhaps no outside country has more to gain from peace on the Korean peninsula than China. And so, as the leaders of North and South Korea ended their three-day summit meeting with an agreement and a hug, Chinese officials were understandably elated.</p>
        <p>''The Chinese side believes that the summit has produced important results and is a major event of historic significance,'' said Zhu Bangzao, the Foreign Ministry spokesman. ''It will make a valuable contribution to the maintenance of peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. The Chinese side is heartily pleased.''</p>
        <p>In fact, the meeting in Pyongyang  in many ways represented a triumph of Chinese diplomacy, diplomats and policy experts said, because China -- the only major power to have longstanding diplomatic relations with both sides -- was instrumental in bringing the Koreas together.</p>
        <p>''North Korea had to decide it wanted to do this,'' said Zhang Xiaojin, a professor of international relations at People's University in Beijing. ''But compared with other countries, China had an important role.''</p>
        <p>China shares a long border and an even longer Communist brotherhood with North Korea. It fought alongside North Korea in the Korean War, and for the last decade, since the fall of the Soviet Union, it has been North Korea's only significant ally.</p>
        <p>But since it established relations with South Korea in 1992, China has at the same time cultivated increasingly close political relations as well as a brisk trade with Seoul.</p>
        <p>China has fretted about the possibility of armed conflict on the peninsula and about the dire condition of  North Korea's economy -- which has prompted hundreds of thousands of North Koreans to flee illegally into China.</p>
        <p>''China's first goal is not to have an imploding North Korea at its border,'' said David Shambaugh, director of the China Policy Program at George Washington University.</p>
        <p>To that end, China has supplied North Korea with food and fuel during its severe food shortages of the last six years. Chinese diplomats have long encouraged North Korea to follow in China's footsteps: adopting outward-looking reforms in order to revive its moribund economy.</p>
        <p>Until several months ago, that advice seemed to be falling mostly on deaf ears. But the momentum shifted dramatically this spring as North Korea made overtures to a number of Western nations. And just weeks ago, Mr. Kim made the long-awaited visit to China. It was his first official  trip abroad since he became his country's leader in 1994.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kim spent three days in Beijing, meeting with Chinese leaders and touring some of China's most successful high-tech enterprises. He told Chinese officials that he was impressed and indicated that he planned to follow the Chinese model.</p>
        <p>But the summit meeting this week, with the two Korean leaders clearly getting along well together, was perhaps more successful than the Chinese could have dreamed.</p>
        <p>''This kind of friendly dialogue may lead to more support from South Korea -- and that puts less pressure on China,'' said Professor Zhang.</p>
        <p>Foreign policy experts added that the subtle Chinese diplomacy that culminated in the summit meeting might also have reset the geopolitical balance in northeast Asia, diminishing the role of the United States in particular. China had long feared  that the North's collapse could effectively lead to the absorption of North Korea by the South leaving the United States troops now in South Korea right at the Chinese border.</p>
        <p>By cultivating relationships with both North and South, ''China has brought both parties under their tutelage,'' said Professor Shambaugh.</p>
        <p>''They have co-opted South Korea and maneuvered the U.S. pretty much out of this chapter,'' he said.</p>
