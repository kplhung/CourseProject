        <p>The former Soviet republic of Georgia has officially become the 137th member of the World Trade Organization. It is the fourth former republic to gain membership, joining Kyrgyzstan, Latvia and Estonia. The country first applied to join in 1996 and was approved for membership last October. When Georgia's Parliament failed to ratify its membership accord before January, the deadline was extended. About 30 other countries, notably China and Russia, are waiting to join the global trade group, which sets rules for international commerce.</p>
