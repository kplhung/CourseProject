        <p>Gone in 60 Seconds  Nicolas Cage, Giovanni Ribisi, Angelina Jolie, Robert Duvall, Delroy Lindo, Timothy Olyphant, T. J. Cross, Christopher Eccleston  Directed by Dominic Sena  PG-13 119 minutes</p>
        <p>For a one-step action plot, assign a huge task and allow no time. In this case the object is to steal 50 automobiles and have them on a container ship in four days. ''These are not Honda Civics,'' says Memphis Raines (Mr. Cage), a former master car thief. You could pay $150,000 for some of these vehicles -- snarly new Lamborghinis and Ferraris, a 1967 Shelby Mustang GT 500, a 1962 Aston Martin DBI.</p>
        <p>So switch off the brain ignition and get ready for a summer clang-banger of an auto show and demolition derby courtesy of the producer Jerry Bruckheimer, who wrecked a lot of stuff in ''Con Air,'' also with Mr. Cage, a few summers ago.</p>
        <p>Situations like these call for another action staple: the legendary pro who has sworn off whatever bad thing he was so good at doing but is forced to resume with extreme reluctance. Memphis, lately a legitimate go-cart dealer, returns because of his little brother, Kip (Mr. Ribisi), who is still stealing cars.</p>
        <p>In an era of swift, computer-assisted thievery, Kip still throws a brick through one plate-glass window and drives the Porsche through another plate-glass window. Little wonder he is behind in his deliveries to Raymond Calitri (Mr. Eccleston), an auto-theft impresario eager to meet his quotas and uphold his reputation in South American stolen-car circles.</p>
        <p>Handcuffing Kip to a car about to be crushed in a scrap-yard compactor, Calitri summons Memphis and tells him to steal 50 cars in the time allotted or his brother is a bouillon cube.</p>
        <p>All right, all right, says Memphis, who then proceeds to fritter away three of the four days rounding up his old car-stealing crew. With but hours left, he and his associates start picking off the treasured 50. Everybody drives very fast, and there are a lot of accidents.</p>
        <p>VIOLENCE People get roughed up and so do the paint jobs.  SEX Memphis and a colleague (Ms. Jolie) get into the carnal spirit while waiting for a couple to start lovemaking and become distracted enough not to notice that their purple Ferrari is being stolen. But this being a PG-13 movie, things are too hot not to cool down.  PROFANITY Some strong cussing can be heard over the engines'  scream.</p>
        <p>For Which Children?  UNDER AGE 11 The film is not suitable for young children, but by age 10 or so some parents may relent.  AGES 11 AND UP Those cars. Those chases.</p>
        <p>Big Momma's House  Martin Lawrence, Nia Long, Terrence Howard, Ella Mitchell, Paul Giamatti, Jascha Washington  Directed by Raja Gosnell  PG-13 97 minutes</p>
        <p>To trap an escaped killer named Lester (Mr. Howard), an F.B.I. agent named Malcolm (Mr. Martin) and his partner, John (Mr. Giamatti), trail Lester's ex-girlfriend, Sherry (Ms. Long), who they hope will flee and lead Lester to her grandmother's house in suburban Georgia.</p>
        <p>Big Momma's house. A stakeout is set up across the street, but an opportunity to get into the place to plant surveillance devices presents itself when Momma (Ms. Mitchell) departs for an extended time away. Malcolm then decides to become the woman, which plays into Mr. Lawrence's considerable talent for transformation and introduces elements of ''Tootsie.''</p>
        <p>To impersonate Big Momma, an extremely large woman, Malcolm applies great slabs of latex to all parts of his body. The face especially threatens to slide south, and at one point Malcolm, making an emergency exit from an upper floor, falls through the bottom of the rig.</p>
        <p>But he certainly fools Sherry, who appears on Momma's doorstep with her young son, Trent (Jascha Washington). Along with the rest of the town, Sherry takes to the imitation Big Momma as if she were the genuine article. Malcolm appreciates Sherry, too, particularly in abbreviated outfits, but ogling from within Big Momma's mountainous folds gets awkward.</p>
        <p>As Momma, Malcolm finds out that he's a prolific cook of greasy baked goods and a midwife. (''It's a baby!'' he shrieks during a birth.) He's also a jivey preacher, a gospel belter and, stirring in Malcolm's talents, a pretty fair playground basketball player. Granny's got game, but then Lester appears and Malcolm is forced into some police activity. Finally the real Big Momma returns, and there are romantic matters to straighten out.</p>
        <p>VIOLENCE Quite a bit, but always comic and plainly so.  SEX There is the childbirth scene, and Malcolm's Big Momma has a hard time containing her lust for Sherry.  PROFANITY The bathroom variety, loud and crude.</p>
        <p>For Which Children?  UNDER AGE 10 The movie is both relatively harmless and basically inappropriate for small children.  AGES 10-12 Mr. Lawrence is gamey, but he is a funny man. Children would have a good time. Parents must decide.  AGES 13 AND UP Why, sure.</p>
        <p>Shanghai Noon  Jackie Chan, Owen Wilson, Lucy Liu, Xander Berkeley, Walton Goggins, Roger Yuan, Brandon Merrill  Directed by Tom Dey  PG-13 110 minutes</p>
        <p>Unwillingly betrothed to a chubby fellow who stuffs himself with cupcakes, Princess Pei Pei (Ms. Liu) is luckily kidnapped and ends up in Nevada, where, the year being 1881, Indians are warring and Chinese slave laborers are building a railroad. Sent in pursuit, a detail of imperial bodyguards brings an emperor's ransom to be offered for her return.</p>
        <p>The most determined of the emperor's men, Chon Wang (Mr. Chan),  falls in with a blond, very relaxed train robber named Roy O'Bannon (Mr. Wilson) and rescues a little girl after a wild brawl with a half-dozen Crow warriors. That makes him a hero in an Indian village, where he puffs too much peace pipe and wakes up with the chief's daughter (Ms. Merrill), to whom he is married forthwith.</p>
        <p>Many martial arts altercations lie ahead for Chon Wang (pronounced John Wayne by this time in his adventures), who in best Jackie Chan fashion erupts as if a string of firecrackers had gone off in his trousers. O'Bannon, a New Age forerunner, has calming advice and a habit of disappearing in a crunch. The princess meanwhile decides she will stay in Nevada to help her laboring countrymen. Could it be that she has fallen for Chon Wang? And what is to be done with all that ransom?</p>
        <p>VIOLENCE The hand-to-hand combat is furious, funny and partly realistic. People also get shot and killed, but the cumulative effect is humorous.  SEX A tepee tryst is revealed the morning after.  PROFANITY Some rowdy cowboy talk.</p>
        <p>For Which Children?  UNDER AGE 8 Mr. Chan is a delight at any age, but all this would be confusing, overwhelming and just not right for the little ones.  AGES 8-10 The film is a bit of a gray area at this level. Parents know best.  AGES 11 AND UP Fine.</p>
