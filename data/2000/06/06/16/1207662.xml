        <p>Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy Broadway and Off Broadway shows this weekend.

        <p>Broadway</p>
        <p>''AIDA'' (Tony winner for best musical actress, score, scenery and lighting). Pretty much everything that's right about this Disney cartoon pretending to be a Broadway musical can be summed up in two words: Heather Headley. Playing a Nubian princess in captivity, the Tony-winning Ms. Headley has fire, self-possession and an uncompromising sense of purpose. That is more than can be said for anyone or anything around her. ''Aida,'' which has been directed by Robert Falls with songs by Elton John and Tim Rice, seems stranded in its own candy-colored limbo, thrashing between childish silliness and civic preachiness, between campy spoof and tragic tear-jerker, between two and three dimensions. Although it is the first Disney production for Broadway not to be inspired by an animated film, it appears to be waiting for the greater destiny of translation into a cartoon. With Adam Pascal (of ''Rent'') as the hieroglyph-stiff love interest and Sherie Rene Scott, making like a refugee from ''Beverly Hills 90210,'' as Aida's rival. The eminent set designer Bob Crowley provided the Las Vegas arcade that is passing for ancient Egypt (2:30). Palace, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212) 307-4747. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $20 to $85 (Ben Brantley).</p>

Pretty much everything that's right about this Disney cartoon pretending to be a Broadway musical can be summed up in two words: Heather Headley. Playing a Nubian princess in captivity, the Tony-winning Ms. Headley has fire, self-possession and an uncompromising sense of purpose. That is more than can be said for anyone or anything around her.

Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $20 to $85 (Ben Brantley).</p>
        <p>* ''CONTACT'' (Tony winner for best musical, choreography and featured actor and actress). The most potent antidepressant available in New York. Advertising has it that this show from the director and choreographer Susan Stroman is a ''dance play,'' but that hardly captures how it makes you feel. Aided by the dramatist John Weidman and a dream ensemble, Ms. Stroman has created the unthinkable: a sexy, polished work that restores the pleasure principle to the American musical. A theatrical portfolio of three seemingly unrelated vignettes set in different time periods, with top-drawer leading performances from Deborah Yates and the Tony winners Boyd Gaines and Karen Ziemba, ''Contact'' uses an ingeniously selected medley of recordings ranging from Bizet to the Beach Boys. But like a classic Rodgers and Hart musical it converts the messy daily ingredients of sexual attraction and conflict into something as smoothly sweet and tart as a Key lime pie. Both the intoxication of love and the hangover of loneliness are given idealized, elegant form as ''Contact'' weaves romance from a reality we are all familiar with (2:00). Beaumont, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 and $80 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>*++ ''COPENHAGEN'' (Tony winner for best play, director and featured actress). Who would ever have thought it: that three dead, long-winded people talking about atomic physics would be such electrifying companions? Michael Frayn's endlessly fascinating speculation on the ambiguity of human motives and the limits of scientific knowledge takes on a subject that would seem to have the sex appeal of a frozen flounder: a meeting in 1941 between the Danish physicist Niels Bohr (Philip Bosco) and Werner Heisenberg (Michael Cumpsty), his former protege and a German, during which no one, to this day, knows exactly what happened. Mr. Frayn turns the encounter among the men and Bohr's wife, Margrethe (the Tony-winning Blair Brown), into a wide-ranging, intensely emotional consideration of everything from quantum mechanics to the loss of a child, from the fate of the world in the atomic age to the nature of friendship. Under the meticulous direction of Michael Blakemore, with three fiercely passionate performances, the result is a most invigorating and ingenious play of ideas (2:20). Royale, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $40 to $65; $25 student rush tickets at box office on day of performance (Brantley).</p>
        <p>*++ ''DAME EDNA: THE ROYAL TOUR.'' Delightfully appalling. In this evening of un relenting self-worship, Dame Edna Everage, the Australian housewife turned superstar, anoints herself the new queen of Broadway, and not without reason. The inspired conception (and alter ego) of the comedian Barry Humphries, Dame Edna combines the insufferable smugness of middle-class complacency with the insufferable smugness of stardom, turning all the world into her adoring acolytes. The show, a testament to Mr. Humphries's status as a great physical comic as well as a loopy social satirist, becomes a lopsided conversation between the dominating Dame and her audience. The production's strength isn't in the jokes (which are of varying quality) but in the uninhibited relish with which they are delivered. Despite some mildly humiliating exercises in audience participation, the show becomes a gleeful, surrealist flight into a bubble-gum-pink empyrean (2:20). Booth, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $45 and $65 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>* ''KISS ME, KATE'' (Tony winner for best musical revival, director of a musical, musical actor, costumes and orchestration). A mouthwatering revival, with ham as the plat du jour, of Cole Porter's sybarite's delight of a musical about battling egos in show business. As presented by a preening cast led by the wonderful Marin Mazzie and the Tony-winning Brian Stokes Mitchell, who wear a spotlight as if it were a dressing gown and vice versa, this ''Kate'' proves that ham can indeed make a banquet if the spices are zesty enough. Avoiding the attitudes that are anathema to lively revivals of vintage musicals -- reverence and condescension -- the director Michael Blakemore and the choreographer Kathleen Marshall have shaped a show that is broad, brazen and finally irresistible. The production which doesn't seem to have a thought in its giddy head beyond entertaining us as much as it's entertaining itself, feels like one long ear-to-ear grin. The top-drawer Porter score has been beautifully orchestrated by Don Sebesky and is appetizingly sung by an ensemble that conspicuously features a sharp-edged ingenue named Amy Spanger (2:20). Beck, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $29 to $85 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>*+ ''A MOON FOR THE MISBEGOTTEN'' (Tony winner for best featured actor). Every time Cherry Jones and Gabriel Byrne make physical contact in this heart-stopping new production of Eugene O'Neill's great, elegiac love story, the floodgates open to a tide of clashing emotions. The characters they play, an earthy farm woman and a burned-out actor, are as opposite as the quick and the dead. But it is clear that each is wearing a mask that only the other can remove. What makes this ''Moon,'' lovingly directed by Daniel Sullivan, so illuminating is the extraordinary transparency of its stars: their ability to play, and display, all those layers at once. To watch Ms. Jones, Mr. Byrne and the Tony-winning Roy Dotrice react to one another is to realize the degree to which O'Neill's last completed play is about how everyone is an actor, a deceiver by necessity. Infused with both clear-eyed observation and a warm, luminous empathy, the performance's solid three hours melt into a quick-coursing stream (2:45). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $60 and $70; $26 (at box office only) (Brantley).</p>
        <p>* ''THE MUSIC MAN.'' A show that makes you feel ridiculously happy one instant and seriously sleepy the next. The director and choreographer Susan Stroman, who created the inspired dance-musical ''Contact,'' isn't as confident in her take on Meredith Willson's jubilant story of a traveling con man who brings rhythm to the stolid town of River City, Iowa. Her transforming imagination stops when the music stops. The production has two perfectly agreeable stars in Craig Bierko, in the title role, and Rebecca Luker, as the frosty librarian who learns to melt. But you get the impression that most of the people onstage are just pretending to live in a land of corn-fed propriety and corny jokes, marking time until a production number comes along. When the show is singing or, especially, dancing, it often seems to have winged feet; when it's just talking or clowning around, those feet are flat (2:50). Neil Simon, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $40 to $85 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>*+ ''THE REAL THING'' (Tony winner for best play revival, actor and actress). This immensely appealing revival of the Tom Stoppard play, from the Donmar Warehouse in London, is a rare thing even in what has been an exceptionally strong season for straight plays: an elegant comedy of infidelity filled with the sort of comebacks that people only wish they were capable of themselves. True, Mr. Stoppard's anatomy of a cerebral (and anachronistically romantic) playwright, played with all-conquering charm by the Tony-winning Stephen Dillane, is also always subverting itself, pointing out how some things, love among them, defy glib articulation. But, ah, how articulately it manages to say so. If its structural game-playing seems a tad too clever this time around, few comedies have managed to have it so successfully both ways. David Leveaux is the highly accomplished director. The delectable Jennifer Ehle, a Tony winner and a standout in an exceptionally polished cast, plays the self-possessed object of Mr. Dillane's affections (2:15). Barrymore, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $30 to $70 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>* ''TRUE WEST.'' The season's most exciting and evenly matched slugfest. With two of this country's finest young actors, Philip Seymour Hoffman and John C. Reilly, squaring off in this superb new revival, a clean victory is impossible to call. Which is entirely appropriate to Sam Shepard's 1980 story of two brothers locked in an increasingly brutal, increasingly funny struggle for identity. Hey, it's family. Nobody wins. Mr. Hoffman and Mr. Reilly are alternating in the lead roles (through Sunday, after which they will be replaced by Josh Brolin and Elias Koteas), and to see each in both parts is to enrich deeply your appreciation of just what good actors can do with the limited instruments known as the human body and voice. Under Matthew Warchus's pitch-perfect direction, the production makes a persuasive case for ''True West'' as a great American play. The contrast between the two versions, similarly staged but remarkably different in tone, also shows the variety that can be harvested from a work this fertile without betraying its essential nature (2:00). Circle in the Square Theater, 50th Street and Broadway, (212) 239-6200. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $67.50 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>Off Broadway</p>
        <p>*+ ''DINNER WITH FRIENDS.'' It would be difficult to forge a more harmonious union of cast, director and script than the one created at the Variety Arts Theater, where Daniel Sullivan's unflinching production of Donald Margulies's rueful play deserves a long and healthy run. Mr. Margulies has fashioned a deceptively straightforward suburban comedy. He has chosen the most shopworn of subjects, marital infidelity. Yet his take is so forthright and clear-eyed that the normal array of yuppie hang-ups are made rawer here, more disturbing. What initially seems a rather conventional glimpse at the perils of breaking up becomes an original examination of the terrors of staying together. The production, which has been given a gorgeous shelter-magazine sheen by the set designer Neil Patel, is as satisfyingly professional as they come (2:10). Variety Arts, 110 Third Avenue, at 13th Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $30 to $60 (Peter Marks).</p>
        <p>* PROOF. An exhilarating and assured new play that turns the esoteric world of higher mathematics literally into a back-porch drama, as accessible and compelling as a detective story. A mystery about the authorship of a particularly important proof, it is also about twin enigmas: genius and love. Without any baffling erudition the play presents mathematicians as both blessed and bedeviled by the gift for abstraction that ties them achingly to one another and separates them, also achingly, from concrete-minded folks like you and me. Perhaps most satisfying of all, it does so without a moment of meanness. As directed by Daniel Sullivan with the pace of a psychological thriller, and performed by an exemplary cast, most notably Mary-Louise Parker, the play reaches into the most competitive and difficult intellectual terrain and finds -- guess what? -- good people (2:00). City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2:30 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2:30 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $50 (Bruce Weber).</p>
