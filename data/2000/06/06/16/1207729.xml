        <p>When Ruby Sprott read an advertisement last fall announcing plans for new two- and three-family houses in central Harlem for people with annual incomes of $50,000 to $70,950, she saw it as an opportunity to make the leap from a 12-year renter to a homeowner in the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>Dr. Sprott, an education professor at the State University of New York at Old Westbury, is among the buyers at Lafayette Theater Townhouses, a $10.9 million development that will create 73 residences in 27 two- and three-family homes. Construction started last week on the houses, which will rise in clusters on nine vacant scattered sites bounded by West 129th and 134th Streets, between Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard and Fifth Avenue.</p>
        <p>All the four-story homes, being built by the Novalex Contracting Corporation of Harlem, have been sold or are under contract to be sold at an average price of $327,694 since marketing began nine months ago. They are being designed to resemble the existing 19th-century brownstones being renovated on the blocks, which are in or near the historic Lafayette Theater area.</p>
        <p>Charles A. Brass, president of the New York City Housing Partnership, an intermediary between the city and private builders, said the new houses would complete redevelopment of those blocks by filling in the vacant lots with housing that is affordable and blends with neighbors.</p>
        <p>Both the area and the project are named for the theater that once stood at 2225 Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard, between 131st and 132nd Streets. From the time the theater opened in 1912 through the 1930's, it was the venue for various black theater companies, most known as the Lafayette Players. After being abandoned in the late 1930's, the theater was used temporarily as a church, and while being restored was destroyed by fire in 1968. A church now stands on the site.</p>
        <p>When the Lafayette houses are completed in 18 months, Dr. Sprott will move into a new three-family home from a two-bedroom rental in the neighborhood. ''I never seriously looked to buy a house because I figured I couldn't afford one like this,'' she said. ''Now, I have more space in a house with appealing architecture that is new so I don't have to struggle with renovating an old one.''</p>
        <p>Comparable new housing in the area starts at $450,000 to $550,000, said Carole N. Griffin, who heads the Griffin Group, a residential brokerage company in Harlem and is sales agent for Lafayette Theater Townhouses. The Black United Fund of New York is the community sponsor for the project, which received an $8 million construction loan from Fleet Bank, an active lender in Harlem.</p>
        <p>Lafayette Theater Townhouses is part of the city's Neighborhood Builders Program, which helps neighborhood contractors develop and provide affordable housing. Its sponsors include the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development and the Housing Partnership. Novalex has been involved for the last five years in the rehabilitation of about 90 buildings, mainly brownstones as well as small apartment houses, said Michael T. Rooney, its vice president. This is its first new construction project.</p>
        <p>The state and the city provided capital subsidies averaging $23,900 per unit in each of the houses, and the Manhattan borough president's office has added $4,100 per unit. The total average subsidy for each home, $76,930, lowered the sale prices ranging from $279,900 to $359,900. Much of the money from the borough president's office will allow the developer to add such architectural details as stoops and cornices.</p>
        <p>At the same time, under another city program, work is completed or will begin on three projects on and near the blocks of the Lafayette Theater Townhouses. They involve the renovation of 82 brownstones.</p>
        <p>Lafayette Theater Townhouses was conceived four years ago. But it took until last month to secure the building permits and obtain the additional financing for the design of the homes, all the while keeping them affordable, said Carol L. Abrams, a spokeswoman for the housing department.</p>
        <p>In addition to the public subsidies, another key is that the Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, is financing the mortgages under more flexible underwriting guidelines. These allow the lender to qualify buyers by deducting 60 to 75 percent of the rental income, for two- and three-family homes respectively, from the mortgage payment and to use a higher income ratio than the standard 28 percent.</p>
        <p>The two-family homes, with 2,100 to 2,400 square feet, will have a 600-to-700-square-foot one-bedroom rental on the ground level, topped by the owner's three-bedroom unit with 1,500 to 1,600 square feet on three floors. The three-family homes, with 2,900 to 3,800 square feet, will contain an owner's unit, with 1,600 to 1,900 square feet on the first two floors. The larger homes will have two units that are two-bedroom rentals, with 900 to 950 square feet on the top two stories, while the smaller homes will have two one-bedroom units with 700 to 800 square feet on the upper floors.</p>
        <p>Rents in Harlem have also risen to offset the monthly cost, Mr. Rooney of Novalex said. Monthly rents for the apartments will be $900 to $1,100 for the one-bedroom units and $1,100 to $1,300 for those with two bedrooms, Ms. Griffin, the broker, added. The project is also eligible for a 20-year tax abatement from the city.</p>
        <p>The homes, designed by Roberta Washington Architects of Harlem, will have masonry concrete facades in addition to the cornices and stoops ''to replicate the look of original brownstones,'' Mr. Rooney said.</p>
