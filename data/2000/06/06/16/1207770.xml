      <block class="full_text">
        <p>President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said today that prosecutors had gone ''too far'' in jailing the owner of Russia's largest independent media company two days ago.</p>
        <p>''I personally believe that this is excessive,'' Mr. Putin said during his state visit to Berlin. ''I think it should have been possible to handle this without an arrest.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin's remarks were the first time that he has criticized the detention of Vladimir A. Gusinsky, the owner of Media-Most, an influential amalgam of newspaper, radio and televison interests that had been critical of the government.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin has repeatedly insisted that he cannot influence the actions of Russia's prosecutor general, Vladimir Ustinov. And today he stopped short of saying the case against Mr. Gusinsky was without merit.</p>
        <p>But his comments raised questions not only about the arrest but also about Mr. Putin's control over his  Kremlin aides, many of whom he inherited from President Boris N. Yeltsin.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Putin was not aware of Mr. Gusinsky's arrest, as he has said before, and did not approve of it, as he said today, the question was who ordered it, and why. Some in the Russian capital, including Mr. Gusinsky's aides, traced the actions against Media-Most to Aleksandr Voloshin, the Kremlin chief of staff, who is close to the inner circle of the former Kremlin regime, known in Moscow as the ''family.''</p>
        <p>And if senior Kremlin officials had acted behind his back, the question was whether Mr. Putin would try to take action against them, and thus demonstrate his political independence. He is expected to return to Moscow on Friday.</p>
        <p>Another possibility was that Mr. Putin was simply trying to distance himself from a decision that had set off intense criticism at home and abroad. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott appeared in an unusual taped interview on Mr. Gusinsky's NTV television network today and warned that government interference with the press would  hurt Russia's standing in the world.</p>
        <p>And today Robert S. Strauss, a former United States ambassador to Russia, canceled plans to lead several top American business executives to Moscow for a meeting with Mr. Putin. The trip was to have been conducted under the auspices of the U.S.-Russia Business Council, a Washington trade association. Mr. Strauss, who said he knew Mr. Gusinsky when serving in Moscow, said it would be inappropriate to promote commercial investment there now because the jailing of the top media executive well known for criticizing Mr. Putin ''raised political and legal questions'' about Russia under its new president.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gusinsky was arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of embezzling millions of dollars in state property. He has denied the charges, and his detention is widely seen in Russia as a politically motivated campaign against a powerful media tycoon who had criticized the government and made enemies in the Kremlin.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gusinsky, 47, owns the nation's only independent television network, one that avoided the Kremlin's embrace during the recent parliamentary and presidential elections and has provided reasonably objective coverage of the brutal war in Chechnya. He also controls several important publications.</p>
        <p>Since he was put in jail, Russia's most powerful business tycoons have assailed the move, fearing it could be the start of a crackdown that could lead to their detention as well.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gusinsky remained in the Butyrskaya prison. The chief prosecutor in the case, Valery Nikolayev, said that charges would be brought against him on Friday, and suggested that he might be released afterward pending trial.</p>
        <p>As the furor over the arrest continued, Geni Reznik, Mr. Gusinsky's lawyer stood outside the prison and read a two-page handwritten statement that he said came from his client.</p>
        <p>''This is a political intrigue organized by high-ranking representatives of the government who consider freedom of speech a danger,'' the statement said. ''During the first interrogation, I witnessed a laughable scene as two investigators quarreled and interrupted one another for half an hour as they tried to say what they suspect me of.''</p>
        <p>In his remarks today, Mr. Putin  said Mr. Gusinsky should not have been jailed, but merely questioned.  Rather than put him in jail, ''it would have been possible to insist that he not leave the country,'' Mr. Putin said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ustinov, the prosecutor general, is believed to have been appointed by Mr. Putin at the insistence of Kremlin aides who are close to members of the Yeltsin family and the financier Boris A. Berezovsky, including Mr. Voloshin, the Kremlin chief of staff. Virtually nobody in Russia believes that the prosecutor is truly independent of powerful political and financial interests.</p>
        <p>One view of Mr. Putin's role is that he is not yet fully in control of the Kremlin, but is dependent on aides like Mr. Voloshin, who helped bring him to power. That runs counter to the image that Mr. Putin has sought to foster of a decisive leader who is determined to bring order to Russia. The other view is that Mr. Putin was disingenous when he insisted he was not behind the campaign against Mr. Gusinsky.</p>
        <p>The first scenario, the newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets observed acerbically today, ''means the president is weak and not in charge.'' The second scenario ''means he is the main persecutor of dissent.''</p>
