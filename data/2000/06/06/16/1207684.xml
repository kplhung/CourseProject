        <p>If you're still disconsolate over the demise of ''Beverly Hills 90210,'' then ''Boys and Girls'' may be the movie for you. I don't mean the early, cheesy Shannen Doherty ''90210,'' mind you, or the sleazy, soap-operatic Dylan-in-distress middle years. What this feeble, harmless romantic comedy calls to mind is an extra-long episode from one of the show's interminable final seasons, in which the cast seemed to change every week and nobody could remember if Donna was still a virgin or not, because nobody -- not the audience, not the writers, not even the long-suffering David -- cared.</p>
        <p>Freddie Prinze Jr., who specializes in anodyne romantic comedies with defiantly forgettable titles, is a nice-looking young actor with a winning, gentlemanly manner -- kind of like Ricky Nelson without the smoldering eroticism. His natural demeanor is so pleasant and untroubled that the screenwriters, a duo called the Drews, and the director, Robert Iscove -- also responsible for ''She's All That,'' Mr. Prinze's first star vehicle -- have had to labor mightily to drum up enough emotional complication to eke out a 90-minute movie. Well, not all that mightily. Mr. Prinze does appear briefly in braces, in a team-mascot gopher head and in an unflattering modified Dutch-boy haircut, but the idea that his character could be at all troubled, lonely or neurotic is a conceit the movie can't possibly sustain.</p>

        <p>If you're still disconsolate over the demise of ''Beverly Hills 90210,'' then ''Boys and Girls'' may be the movie for you. I don't mean the early, cheesy Shannen Doherty ''90210,'' mind you, or the sleazy, soap-operatic Dylan-in-distress middle years. What this feeble, harmless romantic comedy calls to mind is an extra-long episode from one of the show's interminable final seasons, in which the cast seemed to change every week and nobody could remember if Donna was still a virgin or not, because nobody -- not the audience, not the writers, not even the long-suffering David -- cared.</p>
        <p>Freddie Prinze Jr., who specializes in anodyne romantic comedies with defiantly forgettable titles, is a nice-looking young actor with a winning, gentlemanly manner -- kind of like Ricky Nelson without the smoldering eroticism. His natural demeanor is so pleasant and untroubled that the screenwriters, a duo called the Drews, and the director, Robert Iscove -- also responsible for ''She's All That,'' Mr. Prinze's first star vehicle -- have had to labor mightily to drum up enough emotional complication to eke out a 90-minute movie. Well, not all that mightily. Mr. Prinze does appear briefly in braces, in a team-mascot gopher head and in an unflattering modified Dutch-boy haircut, but the idea that his character could be at all troubled, lonely or neurotic is a conceit the movie can't possibly sustain.</p>
        <p>Mr. Prinze plays Ryan, a Berkeley engineering major (hey, stop snickering) whose best (and apparently only) friends are his comic room-mate sidekick (Jason Biggs) and the girl he really loves even though he can't admit it. Her name is Jennifer, she's played by Claire Forlani, and the big joke is that while Ryan's an uptight control freak who insists on planning everything, Jennifer is a wild, spontaneous, free spirit who lives in and for the moment.</p>
        <p>The moment seems to drag on forever. The best thing that can be said about ''Boys and Girls'' is that it is studiously inoffensive. But this means that every time a potentially interesting complication arises -- an inkling of sexual confusion, a situation that might lead to hurt feelings, a funny joke -- the movie bolts like a panicky colt, or like Ryan, who keeps remembering that he has studying to do.</p>
        <p>I saw ''Boys and Girls'' at a sneak preview packed with eager members of its target audience. After about 30 minutes, many of them seemed to wish they'd stayed home to study. ''I never thought I could feel ripped off by a movie I saw for free,'' one young man remarked on his way out. He was the voice of his generation, or at least of the mob of his peers who had, during Ryan's big emotional speech about love, trust and fidelity, howled with derisive laughter at Mr. Prinze's furrowing brow and downturned mouth. They may have been disappointed, but I, at least, was able to leave the theater with new-found respect for America's often maligned and misunderstood youth.</p>
        <p>''Boys and Girls'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some mild profanity, a mild sex scene and some mildly off-color jokes.</p>
