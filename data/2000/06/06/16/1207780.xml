        <p>Patrick J. Buchanan suggested yesterday that ''liberal cop-bashing'' by Hillary Rodham Clinton and others had encouraged the sexual assault spree by a gang of men in Central Park on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Buchanan, who is running for president, launched, unbidden, into an attack on Mrs. Clinton in the midst of a news conference he held near the United Nations to denounce the proposed creation of an international war crimes tribunal. Mr. Buchanan, a Republican who is seeking to run as the Reform Party candidate, suggested the Central Park sexual assaults were, at least in part, the product of declining police morale caused by criticism of police tactics over the past year.</p>
        <p>''The liberal cop-bashing by folks like Hillary Rodham Clinton is in part responsible for the new diminishment of the morale of the police,'' Mr. Buchanan said at a news conference that was sparsely attended, reflecting a significantly lower profile in his latest bid for the presidency.</p>
        <p>''And it would not surprise me in the least,'' he said, ''if a lot of these cops were far less aggressive in defending citizens, and far less likely to get involved in what they ought to be doing -- which is, quite frankly, busting a few heads and taking those folks to jail.''</p>
        <p>Asked for an example of ''liberal cop-bashing'' by Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Buchanan noted the time she referred to the ''murder of Amadou Diallo,'' just before the trial of the four police officers who shot him.</p>
        <p>''That was an outrageous, outrageous, slanderous, vicious, stupid statement,'' Mr. Buchanan said.</p>
        <p>The police officers were subsequently acquitted. Mrs. Clinton has said that she misspoke in describing the shooting as a murder, and apologized for her remarks.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, campaigning yesterday on Long Island, near the home base of her Republican opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio, responded by attacking Mr. Buchanan again.</p>
        <p>''This is another in a long line of Mr. Buchanan's attacks on people -- anti-Semitic comments, his racist and bigoted comments,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''So I'm not surprised.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton said yesterday that she was ''outraged'' by the incident in the park. And Mr. Buchanan described it as ''an act of barbarism and animalism.''</p>
