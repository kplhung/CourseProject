        <p>Soros to Turn to Outsiders To Help Run Hedge Fund  George Soros said that a $6.5 billion revamped Quantum Fund would seek lower returns and be run in part by outside money managers as he continues to withdraw from hands-on management of his huge hedge funds.</p>
        <p>Mr. Soros, 69, said he would put more of his money into more stable real estate and private equity investments. He also said that the new fund, which will be created by merging the Quantum Emerging Growth Fund with the Quantum Fund, would rely less on borrowed money than in the past. [Page C2.]</p>

        <p>Legal Maneuvering in Napster Case  Napster, the Internet service that allows music files to be transmitted online, said that it was hiring David Boies, the lawyer who led the government's case against Microsoft, to help defend it in a battle with the recording industry in a case that many see as landmark for technology-era copyright issues. The industry has asked a court to stop Napster from operating pending the outcome of the trial. [C6.]</p>
        <p>Boeing Plans to Sell St. Louis Unit  Boeing said that it was in talks to sell a parts operation with 1,700 employees at a plant in St. Louis to improve its efficiency. Potential buyers were not disclosed. The unit makes parts from sheet metal and composite materials, the type of work Boeing has sought to shed to concentrate on design, final assembly and services like maintenance. Shares of Boeing, based in Seattle, rose $1.3125, to $40.125. [C8.]</p>

        <p>Foreign Steel Makers Attack Limits  American limits on steel imports have cost United States consumers up to $150 billion in the last three decades, according to a study sponsored by foreign steel producers.

        <p>'Survivor' Could Help CBS Thrive  CBS's enormous summer hit, ''Survivor,'' soared to new ratings heights on Wednesday night, pulling in more viewers than CBS has had on any Wednesday night since the Nielsen Media Research company transformed its ratings system in 1987. Given the effect that ABC's ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' had on the last television season, when it expanded from a summer show to a regular-season show, ''Survivor'' has the potential to turn around CBS's ratings fortunes.

        <p>Oil Investor Is Accused of Fraud  A federal judge has said that investors in Aspen, Colo., have a ''substantial likelihood'' of proving a fraud and racketeering case against Viktor Kozeny, an investment promoter who persuaded them to put up $450 million in an investment-gone-bad. The case involves a venture, managed by Mr. Kozeny, to acquire control of the lucrative state-run petroleum company in Azerbaijan. [C4.]</p>
        <p>Microsoft Replies to Appeals Brief  Microsoft told the Court of Appeals that the judges should ignore a government brief asking them not to begin work on the company's antitrust appeal until the Supreme Court decides whether to consider it. [C6.]</p>
