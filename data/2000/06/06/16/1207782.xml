        <p>THE REFORM PARTY</p>
        <p>WAR CLOUDS OVER LONG BEACH  The Reform Party's convention is taking on some of the trappings of a World Wrestling Federation spectacle, with partisans ''woofing'' at each other on the Internet and demanding extra security guards for the thriller of a nominating show in Long Beach, Calif., in August. ''COME ON BABY, lets ROCK 'cause we've already LOCKED and LOADED!!!!!!'' a Texas party functionary said in an e-mail exchange between party members quarreling over the slow progress of Patrick J. Buchanan toward the party's presidential nomination. Opponents of Mr. Buchanan have no real candidate to oppose him and have begun warning of credentials challenges and possible violence at the convention. ''I anticipate some emotional, physically aggressive people confronting other people,'' said Cedric Scofield, a party committee member. ''We need more security.'' He proposed that floor bouncers be hired. But Gerry Moan, the party chairman, said opponents of Mr. Buchanan's views might present a bigger problem outside the convention center. Accordingly, he has moved more money to perimeter security.</p>

        <p>THE STATES</p>
        <p>BUSH SNUBS KENNEDY FOE  It would seem like an easy decision for the Republican presidential contender to endorse the Republican challenger to Senator Edward M. Kennedy. But Gov. George W. Bush of Texas knows how to walk around a political minefield when he sees one. Asked yesterday about Jack E. Robinson, the only Republican candidate to collect enough signatures to take on Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Bush said at Logan International Airport in Boston, ''It's hard to endorse somebody I've never heard of.'' Earlier in the day he told radio station WBZ: ''I'm very close to Governor Cellucci. I'm going to take my advice from Paul.'' After some uncomplimentary news articles, Mr. Robinson, a 39-year-old businessman, released an 11-page list of embarrassing incidents in his life. Mr. Cellucci, who had originally backed Mr. Robinson, dropped his support.</p>

        <p>G.O.P. AVOIDS FLORIDA FIGHT  Anxious to avoid a divisive primary and protect the party's hold on a Senate seat, Florida Republican leaders and Gov. Jeb Bush orchestrated a shuffle that left Representative Bill McCollum as the party's presumptive Senate nominee and shifted his chief opponent to a race for state office. That opponent, the state education commissioner Tom Gallagher, announced yesterday that he would seek his old job as insurance commissioner, deferring to Mr. McCollum in the race to succeed Senator Connie Mack, who is retiring. Mr. McCollum was far ahead in the money race, but the primary was likely to have been tough and could have left the winner weakened in the general election against the Democratic candidate, Bill Nelson, the current insurance commissioner. While Florida Democrats are disappointed that the Republicans will skirt an intramural fight, many believe that Mr. McCollum, who was a House impeachment prosecutor, will make the better foil.
