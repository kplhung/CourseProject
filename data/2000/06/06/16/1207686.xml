        <p>While New York basks in fine cuisine and exotic restaurants, there is still no better place to be if you're simply in the mood for steak and potatoes. Here are 12 outstanding steakhouses to choose from.</p>
        <p>1. Angelo and Maxie's Steakhouse</p>
        <p>*  [Rating: 1 star]</p>
        <p>(212) 220-9200</p>
        <p>233 Park Avenue South, at 19th Street</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>This is not a place for counting calories, watching cholesterol or moderating. Luckily, you don't have to count your pennies, either. You go to Angelo and Maxie's to enter a bygone era of red meat, cocktails by the goblet, cigars and gentle prices. A cigar shop perfumes the front of the restaurant while a smoking room in back is lined with humidors. The most consistent thing about the food is the portion size: huge but not always tasty. The best bets are the raw bar and excellent shrimp cocktail, the veal chop, the porterhouse steak and the moist chicken, served whole. Desserts -- gooey chocolate concoctions -- are similarly over the top, but the wine list offers some terrific values.</p>

        <p>2. Bobby Van's Steakhouse</p>
        <p>*  [Rating: 1 star]</p>
        <p>(212) 867-5490</p>
        <p>230 Park Avenue, at 46th Street</p>
        <p>$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>This offshoot of the Bridgehampton, N.Y., institution seems comfortable in its perch at the foot of Park Avenue, and the men drinking martinis and smoking in the bar look as if they've been there forever, always a good sign at a two-fisted New York steakhouse. The meat, particularly the porterhouse for two, three or four, can be terrific, with that fine, aged flavor, but it's not consistent. Shrimp cocktail and lobster are also fine choices, as is the giant veal chop. Dessert is not a strong suit.</p>
        <p>3. Cite</p>
        <p>++</p>
        <p>(212) 956-7100</p>
        <p>120 West 51st Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>If you visit this large, boisterous Art Deco restaurant and you see the wine flowing like water, it must be after 8 P.M., when one of New York's great wine deals goes into effect. From 8 to midnight, Cite, one of Alan Stillman's restaurants, which also include the Post House, Smith &amp; Wollensky, Maloney &amp; Porcelli, Manhattan Ocean Club and Park Avenue Cafe, serves a three-course meal for $59.50 with as much as you want of four wines, which usually include Champagne, a decent white and a couple of decent reds. Along with the wine, Cite serves fine sirloin and other steakhouse staples. Sides like creamed spinach and french fries are top-notch.</p>
        <p>4. Frank's</p>
        <p>*  [Rating: 1 star]</p>
        <p>(212) 243-1349</p>
        <p>85 10th Avenue, near 15th Street</p>
        <p>Chelsea</p>
        <p>$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Unlike the fancy uptown steakhouses with their dim lights and thick carpets, Frank's has a no-nonsense air, as if reminding you that what you went out to do was to eat and eat big. Frank's, which moved to this site from its historic location on 14th Street after a fire five years ago, was always a steakhouse for the meat district, and the menu, at least, still shows its roots. Appetizers include extraordinarily tender stewed tripe, sweetbreads, veal kidneys and other butcher-friendly selections. The huge aged T-bone is the best of the steaks, but the shell steak, filet mignon and skirt steak are also fine choices, as well as the veal chop. Cheesecake is just what you would wish for in a steakhouse dessert.</p>
        <p>5. Gallagher's</p>
        <p>+++</p>
        <p>(212) 245-5336</p>
        <p>228 West 52nd Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>The slabs of aged prime beef hanging in the windows of Gallagher's are a steak lover's delight, and if you know anything about meat, so much the better: you can go into the refrigerated room with its hanging meat and pick your own steak. The best bet at this shrine to long-gone prizefighters and sports stars is to stick with the sirloin steak and other basics, like the fabulous steak fries and terrific onion rings.</p>
        <p>6. Keens Steakhouse</p>
        <p>+++</p>
        <p>(212) 947-3636</p>
        <p>72 West 36th Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Simply for atmosphere, Keens is wonderful. The dim lighting from etched-glass lamps, the dark paneled walls, the polished wood tables and the cracked leather banquettes convey a men's club feeling enhanced by the old-time photographs, oil paintings and a collection of more than 50,000 old clay tobacco pipes from the time when Keens was a men's club. The dining room has barely changed since it opened in 1885, except for the name, of course, which used to be Keens Chophouse. Few people are familiar with mutton chops these days, but Keens continues to serve them, along with the usual steakhouse fare and 178 single-malt Scotches.</p>
        <p>7. Michael Jordan's: The Steakhouse</p>
        <p>**  [Rating: 2 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 655-2300</p>
        <p>23 Vanderbilt Avenue, in Grand Central Terminal</p>
        <p>$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Penny and Peter Glazier, Michael Jordan's partners in this venture, have created a different kind of celebrity restaurant. It spotlights the magnificence of the refurbished Grand Central Terminal rather than the magnificence of Mr. Jordan's basketball career. David Walzog, the chef at Tapika (which is also owned by the Glaziers), reworked the standard steakhouse menu with energy and imagination. Onion rings are small, crisp little puffs of onion air, while the creamed spinach is bright green and delectable. All the standard cuts of beef are available: a 6-ounce strip steak, a 12-ounce filet mignon and a double porterhouse for two that weighs in at 44 ounces. But the best is the flavorful rib-eye steak: big, salty and charred on the outside. The wine list includes excellent bottles at fair prices.</p>
        <p>8. Morton's</p>
        <p>+++</p>
        <p>(212) 972-3315</p>
        <p>551 Fifth Avenue, at 45th Street</p>
        <p>$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Morton's arrived in New York six years ago with its Chicago rituals intact. Take the ''talking menu,'' in which a waiter shows the diners the various cuts of raw meat encased in plastic wrap. Some New Yorkers appreciate this, and some abhor it. The meat is sometimes very good and sometimes not. The best bet is the New York strip, a compact, dense cut that is cooked with great authority, much better than the thin, gray porterhouse. Morton's warm, clubby room and pleasant staff have won devotees. The chain also has a branch in Lower Manhattan at 90 West Street in the shadow of the World Trade Center.</p>
        <p>9. Peter Luger Steakhouse</p>
        <p>***  [Rating: 3 stars]</p>
        <p>(718) 387-7400</p>
        <p>178 Broadway, near Driggs Avenue</p>
        <p>Williamsburg, Brooklyn</p>
        <p>$$$ Cash only</p>
        <p>If you insist, the waiter will give you a menu, but there's not much to read. For more than a century, people have been flocking to these bare, beer-stained halls to eat a single dish: porterhouse steak, served for two, three or four. The potatoes are usually good, and the spinach is acceptable, but the meat is the main point; it's the best steak in America.</p>
        <p>That is why the restaurant is packed seven days a week with people who, perhaps out of necessity, have developed affection for the beer hall setting.</p>
        <p>10. Smith &amp; Wollensky</p>
        <p>**  [Rating: 2 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 753-1530</p>
        <p>797 Third Avenue, at 49th Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>The dry-aged steak at Smith &amp; Wollensky is consistently very, very good. When you order the sirloin rare, it arrives gorgeously cooked, cool in the middle, charred and slightly grainy on the outside. The lobsters are also terrific. As for atmosphere, Smith &amp; Wollensky has a no-nonsense, down-to-earth plainness. Side dishes are impressive and, surprisingly for a steakhouse, chicken and fish are cooked by people who actually seem to like chicken and fish.</p>
        <p>11. SoHo Steak</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 226-0602</p>
        <p>90 Thompson Street, near Spring Street</p>
        <p>SoHo</p>
        <p>$ Cash only</p>
        <p>This thoroughly French little restaurant, drawing a young, good-looking crowd, emphasizes meat but is not a simple steakhouse: music whispers in the background, adding life to a room but never growing too loud; lighting is pleasant but never too dim: and the food is always both familiar and creative.</p>
        <p>It all makes for a festive downtown atmosphere, just right for a moderately priced celebration. Grilled foie gras is wonderful, served with red grapes and aged balsamic vinegar, while a braised oxtail raviolo is an earthy, delicious appetizer. SoHo Steak, of course, offers steak, including a very French grilled sirloin under a pile of crisp, excellent french fries with mustard, and filet mignon with a glaze of foie gras mousse.</p>
        <p>12. West 63rd Street Steakhouse</p>
        <p>*  [Rating: 1 star]</p>
        <p>(212) 246-6363</p>
        <p>44 West 63rd Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>With its leopard-skin-print rug and glass-enclosed private elevator that whisks patrons up to the restaurant, where they are surrounded by mahogany paneling and beautifully framed art, the West 63rd Street Steakhouse is as restful and cozy as a millionaire's library.</p>
        <p>But the food -- especially the steaks -- can be inconsistent: superb on one visit, mediocre the next. Appetizers are also up and down, with excellent shrimp cocktails and fine littlenecks but dreary lobster bisque and steak tartare.</p>
        <p>This wouldn't matter if you could count on the steaks, but that's not the case. The porterhouse and T-bone are sometimes aged to perfection, sometimes not, though the veal chop is a fine piece of meat, and the roasted baby chicken is flavorful. Still, service is considerate, the room is spacious and the congenial atmosphere is a pleasure.</p>
