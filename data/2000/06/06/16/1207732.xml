        <p>This is the third of a series of television commercials in which Microsoft's leaders describe the company's values and its importance to the economy. The first began shortly after a federal judge ruled in April that Microsoft had repeatedly violated the nation's antitrust laws. The current installment, titled ''Vision,'' began running Sunday, four days after the judge ordered that Microsoft should be split in two. Microsoft is appealing both the legal ruling and the breakup order.</p>

        <p>This is the third of a series of television commercials in which Microsoft's leaders describe the company's values and its importance to the economy. The first began shortly after a federal judge ruled in April that Microsoft had repeatedly violated the nation's antitrust laws. The current installment, titled ''Vision,'' began running Sunday, four days after the judge ordered that Microsoft should be split in two. Microsoft is appealing both the legal ruling and the breakup order.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- McCann-Erickson/A&amp;L, part of McCann-Erickson Worldwide, which is a unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies.</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- William H. Gates, the Microsoft chairman, is seated, wearing a blue sweater. His hands are folded with one elbow resting on a table. The setting, at the company studio, is wood tones and personal computers.</p>
        <p>Beside Mr. Gates on the table are a coffee cup, paper and pen, carefully placed to look casual. It is as if Mr. Gates had just paused from contemplation for a few words with the camera. As he speaks, the camera moves closer to him and slightly to his left. His words are accompanied by the soft strains of an acoustic guitar.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- The commercial is entirely Mr. Gates speaking of his company:</p>
        <p>''The next generation of software is being developed right here. It will understand your voice, anticipate your needs, protect your privacy, and connect you to the Internet wherever you are. It will help your children learn, and give businesses new tools to succeed in the coming digital world.</p>
        <p>''We've been writing great software for the past 25 years. It's what we're all about. It's our passion, and it always will be.</p>
        <p>''The best is yet to come.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- Some competitors will cringe at the declaration that Microsoft products, especially its Windows operating system, are ''great software.'' And whether computers will soon do all that Mr. Gates says is open to question. But how can you argue with vision and optimism? It has certainly worked so far for Mr. Gates.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- The commercial is the equivalent of a ''fireside chat'' with Bill Gates. He presents the benevolent face of Microsoft -- a hard-working paragon of American capitalism, laboring daily to make better software to improve people's lives. It is a visual antidote to the portrayal of Microsoft in the antitrust trial as a bullying, arrogant monopolist. No arrogance in this commercial, which even helpfully identifies Mr. Gates, in white letters, as the chairman and co-founder of Microsoft, in case any Martians are tuning in.</p>
