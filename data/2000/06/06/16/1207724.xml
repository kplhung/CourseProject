        <p>Suddenly, Bill Russell is back in public, emerging from his quiet life on Mercer Island, Wash., as the white-bearded icon of teamwork.</p>
        <p>The Boston Celtics legend is now an ''original,'' who suggests that viewers to ''ask for an original'' Coors beer in a commercial. He was the subject of an HBO documentary that he and his adviser pitched and the recipient of a $400,000 deal to write a book on leadership.</p>
        <p>He is in demand as a motivational speaker at $25,000 a speech. And he is now so available to the Celtics that he attends events like last Sunday's barbecue for season ticket-holders.</p>
        <p>Russell, 66, last wore a Celtics uniform 31 years ago, and last coached, to a 17-41 record, at Sacramento 12 years ago. Then he seemed to disappear, more in the manner of Sandy Koufax, with occasional sightings, than the full-bodied reclusiveness of J. D. Salinger.</p>
        <p>Why resurface now, and with such gusto? At first, Russell said he did not know. ''I'll see if I can figure it out,'' he said during one of two telephone interviews. ''Can I call you in a week or two?''</p>
        <p>Then, he added, ''I wanted to be forgotten.''</p>
        <p>The thinking behind Russell's planned renaissance was not his. ''My plan was to fade away,'' he said. ''I've tried to keep my life as small as possible. I have some good friends, and I have fun.''</p>
        <p>But that was not what his business adviser, Alan Hilburg, and Russell's daughter, Karen, wanted for him. In the summer of 1998 they convinced him that the end of the millennium would spawn retrospectives and lists about the 20th century's greatest athletes and that he had to tell his story -- or others would.</p>
        <p>''We talked about how much of today's generation doesn't know basketball existed before Magic, Larry and Michael,'' Hilburg said. ''Bill told me that one of his grandchildren asked him, 'Were you as good as Michael Jordan?' ''</p>
        <p>They convinced Russell that his singular identity -- the ultimate team sports champion -- was valuable, but dormant. Russell had won two National Collegiate Athletic Association championships at the University of San Francisco, an Olympic gold medal and 11 National Basketball Association titles in 13 years, but Jordan's Chicago Bulls, with six titles in eight years, had come to symbolize the greatest generation.</p>
        <p>''I was comfortable with going home and closing the door, but Alan and my daughter and a few friends said that wasn't right,'' Russell said. ''They said I shouldn't take my accomplishments in silence. While I'm not completely comfortable with this, I can put myself in a frame of mind where I'm not uncomfortable.''</p>
        <p>Russell's deference to his daughter and his adviser indicates an apparent easing of his need to go his own way. ''When I was active as a player, I always felt I was the only one on the planet who knew what he was doing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Tom (Satch) Sanders, a former Celtics teammate, said: ''Everything's always been a personal choice with Russell. He's charming if he wants to be. He's capable of doing a lot more, but he never wanted to. But he was visible on the golf course.''</p>
        <p>Bob Cousy, another Celtics teammate, added, ''He's mellowed and is allowing himself to reach out and communicate with people who want to have a relationship with him.''</p>
        <p>Inside their unit, Cousy said, Russell was outgoing and witty, but when faced with racism on the outside, he was uncommunicative. ''I think he's concluded that there's good and bad, but you can't be consumed with the bad,'' Cousy said.</p>
        <p>Russell Redux is, in essence, a product relaunch designed to emphasize Russell's championship pedigree, not to deal with his image, ingrained with the public as enigmatic and aloof. He still refuses to sign autographs, preferring to speak to a fan or shake his hand instead. He distinguishes between autographs for fans or teammates and corporate deals to sign goods for a fee to sell to serious collectors.</p>
        <p>The plan to revive the Russell brand took shape in September 1998, when Hilburg invited Frank Deford of Sports Illustrated to meet with Russell in New York. ''Russell couldn't say it out of modesty,'' Deford said, ''but Alan said to Bill, 'The millennium is fading and you're fading; you've got to make an effort to come out.' ''</p>
        <p>Hilburg wanted Deford's input and wondered if he wanted to write about Russell in Sports Illustrated. Deford's positive response led Hilburg to ask if HBO Sports, where Deford also works, would want Russell's cooperation for a documentary. Russell's name had not been on HBO's radar screen as a possible subject because network executives assumed he was unavailable.</p>
        <p>Deford's article was published in early May 1999, three weeks before Russell's No. 6 uniform jersey was retired in an emotional ceremony at the Fleet Center in Boston. In 1972, Russell had demanded that his uniform be raised to the Boston Garden rafters with no fans present. But because the Fleet Center gala was organized by Karen Russell to benefit the National Mentoring Partnership, Russell's favorite charity, he agreed to a public ceremony.</p>
        <p>The event attracted a longtime nemesis, Wilt Chamberlain; Russell's former coach, Red Auerbach; former teammates; and Larry Bird and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. The crowd's standing ovation moved Russell to tears and a rapprochement with Celtic fans.</p>
        <p>Russell's elevated profile began to attract companies and organizations eager to hear him speak.</p>
        <p>''My message is team effort,'' he said. ''Almost all successful organizations are team efforts. What you have to find out in a team is what are your strengths and how to use them effectively, and how not to overuse them and underuse them.''</p>
        <p>Coors and Invesco, a financial services company, sought him out for commercials. To push its slogan -- ''You Should Know What Invesco Knows'' -- Invesco gleaned a 30-second snipped from hours of interviews that discusses how grabbed a rebound based on calculating what the shooter ''does, what he thinks; under stress, how he'll act.''</p>
        <p>Steve Moran, a vice president of Invesco, said it chose Russell in part because the company knew he would rank high on lists like ESPN's ''SportsCentury'' top 50 North American athletes of the century.</p>
        <p>''He exudes wisdom,'' Moran said, ''and we were able to draw a parallel between his specialized knowledge of rebounding and the specialized knowledge we have in our field.''</p>
        <p>Russell met the Coors standard because his play was ''revolutionary or groundbreaking,'' said David Taylor, a Coors spokesman.</p>
        <p>Hilburg said he and Russell are wrapping up two more deals and are seeking an Internet deal. Russell has also agreed to write the leadership book for Dutton.</p>
        <p>All told, the Russell revival will earn enough to secure his retirement, Hilburg said.</p>
        <p>One opportunity that Russell spurned was talking to ESPN for the network's ''SportsCentury'' profile of him. He did not want to dilute the impact of the HBO documentary, which premiered in April, six months after the ESPN profile was broadcast. ''I had no regard for contributing to it or helping it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Yet, last September, he appeared at the Times Square ESPN Zone restaurant to promote ''SportsCentury.'' Why did he promote a series he would not participate in? ''Alan asked me to do it,'' Russell said.</p>
        <p>The longevity of Russell's renaissance may be up to Russell. He could endure like Arnold Palmer, who is ageless in the marketing world, or he could retreat to his serene life, with his companion, Marilyn.</p>
        <p>Russell said, ''Sometimes I read about the alcoholic's creed -- one day at a time.''</p>
