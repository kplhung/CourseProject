        <p>On Sunday, June 4, the CBS News program ''60 Minutes'' showed a striking report as its lead segment:  A man claiming to be Ahmad Behbahani, a ''czar of Iranian state-sponsored terrorism,'' was being held under armed guard in Turkey, where he was seeking to get his story out.</p>
        <p>Interviewed off camera, he told a compelling story. Among other things, he said that he had planned the bombing of the Pan Am jet over Scotland in 1988, as well as two other terrorist acts that have been tied to Iran, the bombing of the Khobar Towers building in Saudi Arabia in 1996 that killed 19 American soldiers and the attack on a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires in 1994 that killed 86 people.</p>
        <p>Nearly two weeks later, ''60 Minutes'' is still not sure who the man is,  and the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are saying he is an imposter. In addition, ''60 Minutes'' has backed off somewhat on his importance.</p>
        <p>''Our source, who is at a high level in our government and whom we trust totally, has told us that the C.I.A. and the F.B.I. have concluded he was in Iranian intelligence, but not as high up as he claimed he was,'' said Lesley Stahl, the correspondent who reported the story.</p>
        <p>But the network is defending its treatment of the interview, saying it had taken great care to make clear that it was reporting only the man's claims.</p>
        <p>The story behind the story has the murky intricacies of a John LeCarre novel. It involves a cast of characters that includes the exiled former Iranian president Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, armed Turkish police officers, a former C.I.A. terrorism specialist and unnamed sources in the Clinton administration, as well as references to several of the most infamous terrorism episodes of the past 12 years.</p>
        <p>''60 Minutes'' said it found the man from a tip provided by Mr. Bani-Sadr. It rushed to the refugee camp in central Turkey to secure the information that Mr. Bani-Sadr said the man was eager to disclose.</p>
        <p>The man, who was being held under armed guard by the Turkish police, never appeared on camera. Instead, an Iranian-born associate producer from ''60 Minutes'' sneaked into the camp and questioned the man, who identified himself as Ahmad Behbahani. The producer then reported what she heard to Ms. Stahl.</p>
        <p>The program used a former C.I.A. terrorism specialist, Robert Baer, as a consultant, and he managed to ask the man a question about an assassination in Iran that, Mr. Baer said, only someone directly involved could have known.</p>
        <p>''We had Baer, who is a very good guy, saying frankly this guy knows some things,'' said Don Hewitt, the executive producer of ''60 Minutes.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Hewitt acknowledged that ''when you're in this world, you often have no idea what the truth is,'' and that was one reason he had hesitated to go with the segment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hewitt said he decided to show the interview after Ms. Stahl reported receiving word from the C.I.A. that the agency's chief in Ankara had  interrogated the man for two days, a sign of his importance, and finally secured a comment from an official in Washington that the man was at least ''in Iranian intelligence.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hewitt said, ''I said that was enough to go with the story.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Stahl said, ''We tried very hard to make sure this was right.'' She noted that the actions of the Turks, who followed the ''60 Minutes'' crew everywhere it went and guarded their subject much more tightly than anyone else in the camp, indicated to her that he was somebody important.</p>
        <p>''We were never told, by any of our sources: 'Don't go on the air with this, you're making a mistake,' '' she said.</p>
        <p>In addition, Ms. Stahl said, on the Friday before the broadcast, a CBS  correspondent in Washington called to say he had been hearing that such a story existed. ''We thought the story was leaking out,'' Ms. Stahl said. ''That was a factor in the decision to go with it.''</p>
        <p>So, at midday that Saturday, Mr. Hewitt made the decision to put the report in the air. He explained: ''I said, 'Let's put it on but let's be very careful.' If you noticed, we were still very careful in how we said this is a man who says he is Behbahani, who says he was involved in these things.''</p>
        <p>But a week later, The Washington Post reported that officials in the C.I.A. and the F.B.I. had concluded that the man was ''an imposter who lacks basic knowledge of Iran's intelligence apparatus.'' The newspaper also reported Iran's denial that the man was Ahmad Behbahani and that the Iranian intelligence ministry identified him as Shahram Beladi Behbahani.</p>
        <p>One main area of dispute was the man's age. The experts cited in The Post said the man would have been no more than 20 when the Pan Am jet exploded, too young, they said, for such an assignment.</p>
        <p>Ms. Stahl said, ''To be fair we did hear some discrepancy about his age.'' But she added that they had information the man is 38, not 32. She said Mr. Bani-Sadr had seen a photograph of the man they spoke to and had said he ''looked like'' Ahmad Behbahani.</p>
        <p>''60 Minutes'' had hoped to have additional evidence on the story, perhaps this week. The program had been told that a section of videotape from a Iranian newscast might show the man they questioned in a security detail for the former Iranian leader Hashemi Rafsanjani.</p>
        <p>But when ''60 Minutes'' asked for the tape to be sent from Ankara by Federal Express, it mysteriously disappeared somewhere in Istanbul -- twice. This led Ms. Stahl to believe that someone did not want ''60 Minutes'' to see the tape.</p>
        <p>''I have to say the loss of that tape does add to my suspicions,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Stahl also said she wondered why anyone would believe an identification offered by the Iranian intelligence ministry, and why her interview subject, if he really is no one important, had not been released from custody.</p>
        <p>''Why go to these lengths to keep him hidden?'' Mr. Hewitt asked. ''If he's a fake, trot him out.''</p>
        <p>Instead, he said, the man is still apparently being held by the Turks, outside the reach of the press.</p>
        <p>Ms. Stahl said: ''I don't know what to think. Of course, it goes without saying that if we were wrong, perhaps we should have waited. But I'm suspicious of everybody in this story.''</p>
