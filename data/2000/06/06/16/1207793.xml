        <p>Through June 24</p>
        <p>The English artists James White and Tim Sheward, conceptualist collaborators since 1995, have produced a stylish installation that is at once annoyingly oblique and richly suggestive. It is dedicated to that multivalent icon, the palm tree.</p>
        <p>At the center of the gallery stand five palms, each the height of a person, laser-cut from green tinted Perspex, a transparent plastic that resembles glass. They look like decorative objects from a fancy department store display. On the surrounding walls hang six large black-and-white photographs laminated to aluminum panels. Three shot in Australia show palm trees with backgrounds of dark, stormy skies and corporate buildings. The three others depict palm trees at a luxury hotel in Italy.</p>

        <p>The English artists James White and Tim Sheward, conceptualist collaborators since 1995, have produced a stylish installation that is at once annoyingly oblique and richly suggestive. It is dedicated to that multivalent icon, the palm tree.</p>
        <p>At the center of the gallery stand five palms, each the height of a person, laser-cut from green tinted Perspex, a transparent plastic that resembles glass. They look like decorative objects from a fancy department store display. On the surrounding walls hang six large black-and-white photographs laminated to aluminum panels. Three shot in Australia show palm trees with backgrounds of dark, stormy skies and corporate buildings. The three others depict palm trees at a luxury hotel in Italy.</p>
        <p>Prompted in part by titles, religious interpretations come to mind. The exhibition is called ''Paradise,'' and so the Italian photographs and the Perspex palms -- four are gathered into a group called ''Garden'' -- evoke Eden. The palm is also associated with Christ's Passion, and the ominous Australian pictures, one of which is called ''Nazareth'' and another ''The Power and the Glory,'' might allude to that.</p>
        <p>These ideas are opposed, however, by corporate and consumerist elements: the office buildings, the luxury hotel, the cheap plastic trees. The sacred collapses into the profane. The most interesting possibility is that the artists are creating a genuine religious poetry. More likely, though, the animating spirit is one of ordinary secularist irony.</p>
