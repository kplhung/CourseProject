        <p>Add another chapter to John Daly's controversial career. He withdrew from the 100th United States Open today, quitting after his first-round 12-over-par 83, which included a 14 on his final hole, the par-5 No. 18.</p>
        <p>Daly's debacle at No. 18 began when he hit his first tee shot out of bounds to the right. Because of the heavy fog, Daly did not realize his ball was out of bounds until he walked up the fairway.</p>

        <p>Add another chapter to John Daly's controversial career. He withdrew from the 100th United States Open today, quitting after his first-round 12-over-par 83, which included a 14 on his final hole, the par-5 No. 18.</p>
        <p>Daly's debacle at No. 18 began when he hit his first tee shot out of bounds to the right. Because of the heavy fog, Daly did not realize his ball was out of bounds until he walked up the fairway.</p>
        <p>He returned to the tee box, then hit two more tee shots out of bounds into the water hazard left of the fairway. With three tee shots and three penalty strokes, Daly was now hitting seven off the tee. He finally hit that tee shot into the fairway, then he laid up about 115 yards short of the green. But his ninth shot went into the water again. He took a drop in the bunker, plus another penalty stroke and was forced to play his next shot left-handed, because his stance was impeded by the sea wall.</p>
        <p>He failed to advance his 11th shot very far, but his 12th shot finally reached the green, then he two-putted for his 14. Daly left the course quickly without comment.</p>
        <p>Daly also had a bizarre finish at last year's Open in Pinehurst, N.C., shooting a final-round 83, including an 11 on the par 4 No. 8. On that hole, Daly took a two-stroke penalty for hitting a ball in motion. Afterward, he vowed not to play in this year's Open but later sent a letter of apology to the United States Golf Association and decided to play this year.</p>
        <p>After today's episode, Daly may regret that he showed up, especially to play just one round, while taking a spot that someone else would have been thrilled to have.</p>
        <p>Clampett Returns in Style</p>
        <p>Bobby Clampett's opening-round 68 was remarkable, considering he has only played in one tournament during the past 21 months, and that he basically retired from the PGA Tour in 1995. Clampett, who had not played in the Open since 1986, made the field as a qualifier, overcoming bogeys on two of the first three holes of his regional qualifying tournament.</p>
        <p>''This is a gift from God,'' he said. ''It was almost like playing golf in heaven, hitting every fairway and green for the first 10 holes and being four under par at an Open.''</p>
