        <p>Right about the time Representative Rick A. Lazio's voting record was being condemned by Hillary Rodham Clinton on Wednesday in her fiercest campaign attack to date, Mr. Lazio was on the floor of the House casting a most prosaic vote, to approve the record of the previous day's proceedings.</p>
        <p>More significant votes would follow over the next 48 hours, and Mr. Lazio, the Republican nominee for United States Senate, was there, off the campaign trail, to keep up a sterling attendance record out of a sense of duty and because he knew his opponent was watching closely.</p>
        <p>In a week in which Mrs. Clinton has intensified her criticism, Mr. Lazio has spent much of his time attending to Congressional duties in Washington, and juggling news media interviews and fund-raising. He attended two fund-raising events here.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio says he remains committed to balancing what he says will be an aggressive campaign schedule with fulfilling his House obligations. He has not promised to attend all votes -- and he has missed some since entering the race May 20 -- but has said he would make an effort to be present for significant ones.</p>
        <p>Independent analysts say Mr. Lazio's predicament is a common one for incumbent representatives, who find their voting records under attack and therefore must dash back to Washington from the campaign trail to show their commitment and concern.</p>
        <p>Stuart Rothenberg, who publishes a nonpartisan political newsletter here tracking Congressional races, said Mr. Lazio's situation was a bit exacerbated by the timing of Mrs. Clinton's barrage, coming just when he needs to be in New York to make himself better known. Several polls have shown the race at a virtual tie, with many people supporting Mr. Lazio more out of opposition to Mrs. Clinton than because of familiarity with what he stands for.</p>
        <p>''It allows her to determine and dictate the state agenda and discussion,'' Mr. Rothenberg said. ''If he is in Washington, it's hard to respond, to counterpunch.''</p>
        <p>Twice in the last week, in an attempt to portray Mr. Lazio as indecisive and beholden to the House Republican leadership, Mrs. Clinton's staff has issued statements accusing Mr. Lazio of changing his vote on some measures to go along with Republicans.</p>
        <p>The latest criticism came today, when Mrs. Clinton's staff said Mr. Lazio changed a vote Tuesday evening on a measure to require drug companies that receive federal financing to offer the resulting products at a reasonable cost to consumers. A spokesman for Mr. Lazio responded by saying Mr. Lazio's final vote in favor of the measure reflected his previously stated position on the issue and that, in the 15 minutes generally allotted for voting, members often adjust their votes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio was not available for an interview, his campaign aides said, but they brushed off Mrs. Clinton's attacks and said Mr. Lazio would keep up his Congressional duties.</p>
        <p>''He takes this job very seriously and he likes to be informed about the issues and a broad range of subjects,'' said Bryan Flood, a campaign spokesman. He said Mr. Lazio planned to resume campaigning on Friday and over the weekend, with events upstate and in the New York City region. Next week, he said, Mr. Lazio will probably return to Washington for a few days for more voting as the session winds down to the Fourth of July recess.</p>
        <p>Attendance was an issue in the 1998 Senate campaign, with the incumbent, Alfonse M. D'Amato, accusing his Democratic challenger, Charles E. Schumer, of missing House votes, until it was learned that Mr. D'Amato had missed votes as a member of the Nassau County Board of Supervisors in 1980 while he ran for Senate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio was present for 99 percent of the votes in the House in 1999, according to Congressional Quarterly; the average was 96.5 percent.</p>
        <p>House records show that since May 20, when he announced he would seek the nomination, Mr. Lazio has missed a handful of votes on incremental pieces of legislation, such as amendments to amendments on bills. He did miss a final vote on a bill dear to Republican leaders -- to phase out the federal estate and gift tax -- on June 9, which passed 279 to 136. Mr. Flood said Mr. Lazio missed it to attend a funeral for an uncle on Long Island. It was also the day he named his campaign manager and, in the evening, visited a Sons of Italy club in the Catskills.</p>
        <p>This week, Mr. Lazio voted for a bill giving electronic signatures on legal documents equal weight as handwritten ones, a measure that passed 426 to 4. He did buck the House leadership in voting against a $339.5 billion measure for education, health and labor programs, which passed 217 to 214 in a vote largely along party lines. Mr. Lazio joined 7 other Republican moderates primarily from the Northeast and 206 Democrats -- in opposing the measure, which President Clinton has promised to veto on grounds that it is insufficient and lacks provisions to hire more teachers and repair schools.</p>
