        <p>Nineteen years ago, Bernadine Skillern caught a quick glimpse of a man who had just committed a nighttime murder in a grocery store parking lot. She identified him in court as Gary Graham in testimony so strong that, despite almost no other evidence, a jury found him guilty and later sentenced him to death.</p>
        <p>With Mr. Graham scheduled to die next Thursday and death penalty opponents mounting an all-out effort to stop his execution, Ms. Skillern testified again today, this time in the court of public opinion.</p>
        <p>Again and again at an hourlong news conference, she repeated her unwavering belief that Mr. Graham was the man she had seen shoot Bobby Lambert outside a Safeway supermarket in Houston.</p>
        <p>''I saw Mr. Graham shoot and kill Mr. Lambert on that parking lot in 1981,'' said Ms. Skillern, 53. ''That has not changed. That is not going to change.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Skillern's emotional but unflinching appearance was a pointed rebuttal in a public relations battle that, until now, has been dominated by advocates for Mr. Graham.</p>
        <p>With protests planned in Texas for next week, the Graham case is attracting national attention and creating a political headache for Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Mr. Bush has defended capital punishment in his state despite growing outside criticism focusing on, among other issues, the quality of legal representation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Graham's advocates say his original trial was a travesty. His court-appointed lawyer, Ronald G. Mock, conducted virtually no investigation of the case and put on no witnesses during the guilt phase of the trial. Ballistics tests showed that a .22-caliber revolver taken from Mr. Graham after his arrest did not match the murder weapon. And two other witnesses who could have contradicted Ms. Skillern's story were never called to testify.</p>
        <p>''There is no other case that has more doubts of innocence today than this man right here,'' said Lawrence C. Marshall, legal director of the Center on Wrongful Convictions at Northwestern University, which has helped exonerate nine death row inmates in Illinois and has taken on the Graham case.</p>
        <p>Sitting before a bank of television cameras at a conference table this morning, Ms. Skillern said she had decided to speak out today because of ''misinformation'' about the case in the news.</p>
        <p>On the night of May 13, 1981, when she witnessed the murder, Ms. Skillern said, she waited in her car with her two youngest daughters, then 9 and 5, as her 14-year-old daughter shopped inside the Safeway. It was about 9:30.</p>
        <p>According to the trial transcript, Ms. Skillern testified that she saw Mr. Graham ''off and on about 60 seconds, maybe a little longer.'' She told the jury that she had seen the side of his face, and that she had then blown her horn, at which point she looked directly at his face for ''a split second, maybe a second.''</p>
        <p>Today, she repeated roughly the same story, saying that she had seen the killer's face from different angles three or four times over 90 seconds. Looking through her windshield, she said, she looked directly into his face when he walked in front of her headlights, about a car distance away. She honked her horn, she said, because she wanted to stop him from shooting.</p>
        <p>''I said, 'Don't! Don't shoot!' '' recalled Ms. Skillern, who held her news conference in the office of her spokesman, Rusty Hardin, a former state prosecutor who is now a defense lawyer.</p>
        <p>At a news conference earlier in the week, Mr. Graham's advocates praised Ms. Skillern's sincerity but raised questions about the reliability of eyewitness testimony in general, particularly in the absence of other evidence.</p>
        <p>Jennifer Thompson, a rape victim from North Carolina, told of identifying her attacker, who was convicted and sentenced to prison, only to later discover from DNA evidence that she had identified the wrong man. So certain was Ms. Thompson of her initial identification that when she was later shown a photograph of the real assailant, she said it was not him. (The man was ultimately convicted, based on DNA evidence.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Graham's advocates have suggested that detectives steered Ms. Skillern toward identifying Mr. Graham by manipulating mug shots and the subsequent lineup.</p>
        <p>Ms. Skillern disputed any suggestion that she had been unduly influenced. She said that she had picked out Mr. Graham's mug shot but that she had wanted to see him in person to confirm her belief that he was the killer. When she saw him in the lineup the next day, she said, she shuddered with fear, not realizing that he could not see her behind a glass wall.</p>
        <p>Next week, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles will vote on whether to commute Mr. Graham's sentence or go forward with the execution. In 1993, the board voted against commutation, but then-Gov. Ann Richards granted Mr. Gray a 30-day stay of execution that led to the re-examination of his case.</p>
        <p>The fact that Mr. Graham has already received one stay sets up a tricky legal situation. Under Texas law, a governor is allowed to grant an inmate only one stay of execution.</p>
        <p>As is his custom, Mr. Bush has remained silent about the Graham case, but a campaign aide said the governor's legal advisers believed that under the law, Mr. Bush cannot grant a stay. Advocates for Mr. Graham say the law could be interpreted to mean one stay per governor, but they say commutation or a conditional pardon to allow a new trial, which can occur only with the parole board's blessing, is their real goal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Graham's lawyers are pursuing a theory that Mr. Lambert was actually killed by a hit man.</p>
        <p>Federal court records indicate that Mr. Lambert had been arrested in Oklahoma City in August 1980 on charges of drug smuggling. Federal officials had subpoenaed him in hope that he would testify against higher-ups in the alleged drug operation.</p>
        <p>Just before he was killed, Mr. Lambert had been seen in a grocery store with a thick wad of bills. But the police found $6,000 in cash in Mr. Lambert's back pocket after his killer fled.</p>
        <p>''That makes it seem rather strange to me, that it was a robbery,'' said Steve Beck, a private investigator who was the head Drug Enforcement Administration agent in Oklahoma City at the time of the murder.</p>
        <p>The Houston district attorney's office has dismissed the possibility of a hitman as ''pure speculation.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Graham, who once pleaded guilty to a string of armed robberies, was 17 at the time of the killing.</p>
        <p>Ms. Skillern has not spoken publicly about the case since Mr. Graham was nearly executed in 1993. She said her testimony had altered her life. She quit her job as an elementary school secretary because of controversy from the trial, though she now works as a secretary in a local school district. She said she had received death threats and harassing telephone calls. But, she said, she has never changed her mind about what she saw that night.</p>
        <p>''I'm very sure,'' she said. ''There's never been a doubt in my mind. Never.''</p>
