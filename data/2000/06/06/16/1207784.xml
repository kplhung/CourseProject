      <block class="full_text">
        <p>President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia proposed today that his country be placed at the heart of Europe's defenses against missile attack. Mr. Putin warned that an American missile defense system would lead to a ''very dangerous'' arms race.</p>
        <p>Speaking to several hundred German business leaders in this capital that long stood at the epicenter of the cold war, Mr. Putin sought to portray Russia as a natural ally of Germany and the new Europe, while depicting the United States as insensitive to European concerns.</p>
        <p>''Our cooperation could take the form of building a nonstrategic missile defense system reliably covering all of Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals,'' Mr. Putin said on the second day of a three-day visit here. ''We think this is all possible technically and technologically. All we need is the political will.''</p>
        <p>The Russian clearly senses that European unease over the American plan has presented an unusual opportunity. The setting in Germany gave his words an added edge.</p>
        <p>The Russians appear to be proposing the use of ''theater'' antimissile systems allowed under the Antiballistic Missile Treaty of 1972 to shoot down short- and medium-range missiles that threaten Europe. The Russians say they are developing technology that could down missile-bearing rockets in the boost phase.</p>
        <p>The United States is skeptical of the idea. But Mr. Putin is aware that his proposal buttresses what appears to be a central strategic aim, driving of a wedge between Europe and the United States.</p>
        <p>Germany, like other European countries, has expressed ambivalence about the proposed American system, which is widely seen here as an unproven weapon against an unlikely enemy and one that would undermine what the Germans call the ''architecture of disarmament.''</p>
        <p>''There is now no risk of all-out war in Europe,'' Mr. Putin said. ''But that is no reason for complacency.'' He added that the proposed American system ''would be a blow, especially in Europe.''</p>
        <p>Because such a United States system would in part depend on equipment placed in Europe, the consequences would be particularly serious, Mr. Putin continued, noting that Russia would have no choice but to regard such equipment as ''directed against Russia'' and would respond ''in an appropriate way.''</p>
        <p>''What would NATO then do?'' he asked. ''Would Russia respond? And what's that called? It's called a new arms race. We think that is very dangerous. Can we find a way out? I am sure we can.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin's hosts appeared mildly taken aback by the provocative tone of the speech that was delivered after Mr. Putin's first meeting with Chancellor Gerhard Schroder. The German government has been relentlessly upbeat about Mr. Putin, who spent five years here as a K.G.B. spy. Germany has described relations between the two countries as a ''strategic partnership.''</p>
