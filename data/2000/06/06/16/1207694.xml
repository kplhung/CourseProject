        <p>Sweet and Lowdown</p>
        <p>Woody Allen's film lives a jazz lover's fantasy: to step back into the 30's and find out what the near-greats were like. And so we have Emmet Ray (Sean Penn, left), a guitarist with just enough talent to get away with his hubris and selfishness. ''I like women but they gotta have their place,'' says Emmet. His girlfriend, Hattie (Samantha Morton), literally never says a word. But ''Mr. Allen's tone,'' Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, ''is too genial, despite the character's obvious dark side, to allow Emmet much weight.''</p>

        <p>Sweet and Lowdown</p>
        <p>Woody Allen's film lives a jazz lover's fantasy: to step back into the 30's and find out what the near-greats were like. And so we have Emmet Ray (Sean Penn, left), a guitarist with just enough talent to get away with his hubris and selfishness. ''I like women but they gotta have their place,'' says Emmet. His girlfriend, Hattie (Samantha Morton), literally never says a word. But ''Mr. Allen's tone,'' Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, ''is too genial, despite the character's obvious dark side, to allow Emmet much weight.''</p>
        <p>1999. Columbia Tri-Star. $105.77; DVD, $29.95. 95 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13. Release date: June 20.</p>
        <p>Anna and the King</p>
        <p>It's unfair to ask this film to be what it isn't, but one still misses Yul Brynner, Deborah Kerr and the music in ''The King and I.'' Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-Fat occupy the roles of the schoolteacher and the Siamese king who sent for her to teach his 58 children. In place of music, Andrew Tennant's adaptation of Anna Leonowens's diaries relies on grand settings and a multicultural sensitivity that splits the pair on political and cultural issues. But ''without any real sparks between the main characters, 'Anna and the King' unfolds like an exotic historical diorama with dramatic vignettes thrown in for spice'' (Stephen Holden).</p>
        <p>1999. Fox. $107.37; DVD not yet available. 147 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13. Release date: June 20.</p>
        <p>The Emperor and the Assassin</p>
        <p>Compared with other Chen Kaige films (''Farewell, My Concubine,'' for example, or ''Temptress Moon''), this one, about China's first emperor, Ying Zheng (Li Xuejian), clanks along as a relatively conventional blood-soaked narrative of back-stabbing imperial politics and mass slaughter. Eventually the emperor's betrayal of his lover and brilliant strategic ally (Gong Li) leaves him friendless and standing alone. One may wonder whether it is a disguised parable about the failed ambitions of Mao's Cultural Revolution, but with its action, pomp, suds and moralizing, ''the movie conveys the sweep of history with a capital H'' (Holden).</p>
        <p>1999. Columbia Tri-Star. $99.36; DVD, $29.95. 160 minutes. Mandarin with English subtitles. R.</p>
        <p>All I Wanna Do</p>
        <p>In 1963 the students at Miss Godard's boarding school include the promiscuous girl (Monica Keena), the angry rich one (Kirsten Dunst) and the bulimic one (Heather Matarazzo). Odette (Gaby Hoffman) arrives with her horse and a way with snappy sayings that leads one classmate to predict that she will become ''a speechwriter or a demagogue.'' When a merger with a boys' school threatens, the girls fight for the school's identity. That leads to girl-power melodrama and bratty farce, but ''the ungainliness is part of the film's charm'' (A. O. Scott).</p>
        <p>1998. Miramax. $104.16; DVD, $32.99. 94 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13.</p>
        <p>Straight to Video</p>
        <p>Other new titles of interest, some of which may have had a theater release, appeared on television or been on videocassette in earlier editions.</p>
        <p>WITNESS PROTECTION. When the petty mobster Bobby Batton (Tom Sizemore) gets caught cheating on his bosses and is ordered killed, he decides to rat on them to the authorities. That lands him, his wife (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) and children (Shawn Hatosy and Skye McCole Bartusiak) in a duplex apartment where they are taught how to live in the Federal witness-protection program by a United States marshall (Steve Beck). They have a lot to learn, especially the arrogant Bobby, and, Ron Wertheimer wrote in the New York Times, the ''process of forced metamorphosis is both fascinating and frightening.'' 1999. HBO. $79.99; DVD, $19.98. 101 minutes. Closed captioned. Release date: June 13.</p>
        <p>POETRY IN MOTION and IMAGINE THE SOUND. Two films by Ron Mann explore Beat writers and 60's avant-garde jazz musicians. Charles Bukowski, Amiri Baraka, William S. Burroughs, John Cage, Allen Ginsberg and Robert Creely, among others, appear in ''Poetry in Motion'' (1982, 90 minutes). Cecil Taylor, Archie Shepp, Bill Dixon and Paul Bley are featured in ''Imagine the Sound'' (1981, 90 minutes). Home Vision. $19.95 each.</p>
        <p>THE MORPH FILES. Peter Lord, a founder of Aardman Animations and co-director with Nick Park (''Wallace and Gromit'') of the forthcoming film ''Chicken Run,'' helped create the British claymation and computer animation series about Morph, an ever-changing character who inhabits a desktop world and lives in a box. 1999. BBC Video. Three cassettes, $9.98 each. 45 minutes.</p>
