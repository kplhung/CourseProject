        <p>OH, I'm going off in 52 directions again! Sorry!'' Gideon Taylor apologizes charmingly, most exuberantly, his hands whipping through the air like a martial artist, his accent and outlook uniquely that of a Dublin man whose father was the Irish government's first Jewish minister.</p>
        <p>The tale he's approaching, in his Manhattan office, took place about a decade ago, in Atsede Mariam, a dot at the end of a footpath in the Ethiopian wilderness. Mr. Taylor, then 26, was sitting in his tukul, the straw and mud hut where he readied thousands of Ethiopian Jews for an airlift to Israel, talking with Kes Taya, their 80-ish, near-blind rabbi.</p>

        <p>OH, I'm going off in 52 directions again! Sorry!'' Gideon Taylor apologizes charmingly, most exuberantly, his hands whipping through the air like a martial artist, his accent and outlook uniquely that of a Dublin man whose father was the Irish government's first Jewish minister.</p>
        <p>The tale he's approaching, in his Manhattan office, took place about a decade ago, in Atsede Mariam, a dot at the end of a footpath in the Ethiopian wilderness. Mr. Taylor, then 26, was sitting in his tukul, the straw and mud hut where he readied thousands of Ethiopian Jews for an airlift to Israel, talking with Kes Taya, their 80-ish, near-blind rabbi.</p>
        <p>''He asked me, 'Do you know about the Jews killed in Europe?' '' recalls Mr. Taylor. '' 'Just one question, then: Why did the Evil King Hitler do that?' ''</p>
        <p>Caught by memory, Mr. Taylor slaps his knee in confounded silence. ''And now,'' he continued, ''I spend all my time thinking about the Holocaust, but I never get to think about it in such simple, basic terms.''</p>
        <p>After a decade with the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, working on rescue missions for Jews in Ethiopia, Yemen and Syria and on relief programs in Africa and Eastern Europe, the tireless Mr. Taylor, 35, is  executive vice president of the Claims Conference, the major umbrella group addressing compensation and restitution for Jewish Holocaust survivors.</p>
        <p>In that role, he has a prominent seat in current negotiations. Working  with Israel Singer, the chief negotiator for the Claims Conference, Mr. Taylor, who has a law degree from Oxford, has been tough and detail-oriented, not only with the Germans, but also in talks with European insurers and the Austrians.</p>
        <p>On Monday, the Clinton administration announced that a major obstacle to the creation of a $5 billion fund by the German government and industry for Nazi-era slave laborers and forced laborers -- Jews and non-Jews -- had been overcome. The deputy treasury secretary, Stuart E. Eizenstat, who represents the United States at the talks, said of Mr. Taylor, ''We wouldn't be where we are today without him.''</p>
        <p>Last year, the Claims Conference, officially known as the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, distributed $239 million to survivors. ''The job is fundamentally impossible,'' Mr. Taylor says. ''You're taking the greatest moral challenge, the Holocaust, and putting it together with the most base form of human interaction -- money. You can't really do compensation, you can't be made whole. So I speak of a measure of justice, something that's symbolic, that helps survivors live with a measure of dignity.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Taylor, two generations removed from the Holocaust, raised in a country neutral during World War II, might seem an unusual choice for the position, which he assumed about 18 months ago. But the Claims Conference needed someone like him.</p>
        <p>ITS accomplishments were substantial: since the 1950's, when its leaders began negotiating without the international support, it has gotten Germany to set aside $50 billion. But some survivors criticized the Claims Conference for being bureaucratic and slow, its overworked  staff impatient with elderly claimants.</p>
        <p>Mr. Taylor was fresh, energetic, compassionate but also practical. He has replaced dusty file cabinets with Web sites and e-mail, speeded the claims process, and insisted on more and better-trained workers to answer the daily flow of 350 calls, 100 letters and 15 e-mail messages.</p>
        <p>Not bad for a guy who, until he came here as a Y.M.H.A. camp counselor when he was 18,  formed his impressions of America from the Herman Wouk best seller ''Marjorie Morningstar,'' ''Peanuts'' comics and books about the Johnson and Kennedy years.</p>
        <p>''Politics in America seemed so glamorous,'' he says. ''Those conventions! The balloons! It was the thing and the thing!'' (This is how he talks when he's worked up: he never met an exclamation point he didn't embrace.) ''Not like at home!''</p>
        <p>As a boy he would campaign  with his father, a veteran member of the Irish parliament, by rushing from church to church  as Mass let out, passing out leaflets and shouting through a bullhorn precariously mounted on their car.</p>
        <p>''The Irish have great respect for religion,'' he says. ''An election worker said to my father, 'Sir, should we also come on Saturdays to your church?' '' (His Polish forebears went to Dublin, opened a storefront and selected an English name that derived from their vocation.)</p>
        <p>It was also in his boyhood that he developed his ability to focus on small stuff -- buying bicycles for Rwandans when war destroyed transportation -- and to think big thoughts. His father's constituents always called the house about potholes, even as his father was working on social justice reform. ''An Irish politician has to be both Senator D'Amato and Senator Moynihan,'' Mr. Taylor remarks.</p>
        <p>Though he lives on the Upper West Side with his wife, Deborah Kazis, a writer, and their daughter, he remains fervently Irish, as only one  who, as a toddler, had an eye-blink appearance in the film of ''Ulysses,'' with Milo O'Shea, and whose mother,  a children's author, is the librarian at a Jesuit seminary, can be.</p>
        <p>But he is acutely conscious of his other identity. ''In the negotiations with the Germans, I try to make sure the details are done,'' Mr. Taylor says, ''because even the smallest detail in a clause can have implications for thousands of people.''</p>
