        <p>The Southfield, Mich., office of FCB Worldwide, part of True North Communications, is parting ways with Little Caesars in Detroit, part of Little Caesar Enterprises. Billings for the account were estimated at $40 million.</p>
        <p>Scott Anderson, a spokesman for FCB, confirmed a report of the change in the daily fax edition of Advertising Age, adding that the account posed a conflict with the account of the Taco Bell Corporation in Irvine, Calif., part of Tricon Global Restaurants, which is handled out of the Costa Mesa, Calif., office of FCB. The Little Caesars account had been handled by the Southfield office of a True North sibling, the Bozell Group, which was called Bozell Worldwide until September, when the network was reorganized and the business was transferred to FCB.</p>

        <p>Susan Sherbow, a spokeswoman for Little Caesars in Detroit, said Little Caesars plans to look for one agency to handle a consolidated account for the pizza chain as well as other businesses owned by Little Caesar Enterprises. Those businesses include the Detroit Red Wings and the Detroit Tigers, which had been handled on a project basis, also by FCB.</p>
