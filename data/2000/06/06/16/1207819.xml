        <p>On a spring day 21 years ago, 6-year-old Etan Patz left his family's SoHo loft to walk to his school bus alone for the first time, and vanished without a trace. Over the years, his unsolved disappearance haunted investigators and came to symbolize the agonies of families with children missing in America.</p>
        <p>For a decade, the prime suspect in what investigators believe was Etan's abduction and murder has been Jose A. Ramos, 55, a former mental patient now imprisoned for molesting a boy in Pennsylvania. While Mr. Ramos is said to have made admissions about Etan, no proof -- or a body -- has ever been found. And Mr. Ramos is up for parole in September.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, working with some urgency but quietly so as to raise no false hopes of a breakthrough in the case, a dozen police officers and detectives spent eight hours in the dark, filthy basement of a tenement at 234 East Fourth Street on the Lower East Side, where Mr. Ramos was living on May 25, 1979, the day Etan vanished a mile away.</p>
        <p>No one expected to find a body or even fragments of one after so many years. In the boiler room, however, the police broke up a rusted, unused 1939 coal-fired furnace and hauled it out in chunks, and they carried away a dozen blue plastic barrels of ash and dirt shoveled up from the basement floor. None of the officers at the scene would comment on what they were up to.</p>
        <p>But Inspector Joseph Reznick, the commander of special investigations, the Police Department's umbrella unit for major cases and missing-persons investigations, said last night that all the materials are to be examined for DNA evidence that might prove that Etan's body had been there.</p>
        <p>''It's a huge mass of material and my guess is it will take two weeks to go through it,'' the inspector said. ''There will be no overnight announcement. But this is a long-term investigation, and I won't be satisfied until we've done everything possible to solve this case.'' He noted that Mr. Ramos's parole hearing in September had given urgency to the search for a crucial missing link. ''It's got our clock ticking,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Etan's parents, Stanley and Julie Patz, who still live in the same loft, at 113 Prince Street, and who have campaigned successfully over the years to raise the national consciousness about missing children, were told about the search for new evidence, but were not expecting any major breakthrough immediately. ''Don't hold your breath about what they're going to find,'' Mr. Patz said. ''Don't forget, this is something we live with every day. It's difficult to get excited.'' Nonetheless, he remained hopeful that a case that has seen thousands of leads and theories come to nothing might finally be resolved.</p>
        <p>While no one was ever charged in the disappearance and apparent death of blond, blue-eyed Etan Patz, Mr. Ramos's name surfaced in the inquiry in the late 1980's when Stuart R. GraBois, a former federal prosecutor who spent years working on the case, discovered strong circumstantial evidence against him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ramos, a drifter who had a history of trying to lure young boys into sexual encounters in Montana, California and elsewhere, turned out to be an acquaintance of a woman who worked for the Patzes as a baby-sitter.</p>
        <p>In 1990, while Mr. Ramos was serving a seven-year sentence in Pennsylvania for child molestation and was facing a new charge of sexually molesting an 8-year-old boy,  Mr. GraBois took the unusual step of having himself named a deputy state attorney general to help prosecute the suspect by pressuring him -- in exchange for leniency -- to disclose his possible role in the Patz case.</p>
        <p>Under intense questioning by investigators, Mr. Ramos was said to have admitted that he was with the boy the day he vanished, but he denied abducting and killing him and did not disclose any details that might have implicated him. He pleaded guilty in the Pennsylvania case and was sentenced to up to 20 years in prison.</p>
        <p>There was no further development until last April, when investigators in New York reported that Mr. Ramos had told a cellmate that he had taken Etan to his apartment on May 25, 1979, and had sexually assaulted him. The cellmate quoted him as saying that ''Etan is dead, there is no body, and there will never be a body.''</p>
        <p>The cellmate, who was not identified, also gave investigators what he said was a map drawn by Mr. Ramos showing the Patz loft in SoHo and, a mile to the east, his own building at 234 East Fourth Street on the Lower East Side. The building had been searched for evidence years ago, but nothing had been found.</p>
        <p>Among other developments in the intervening years, forensic scientists have developed techniques for extracting genetic evidence from strands of DNA in fragments of material that might be years old. That hope inspired investigators to look again at the basement, where, they said, Etan's body may have been destroyed.</p>
        <p>Four police vehicles -- a truck, a van, a patrol car and an unmarked supervisor's car -- drew up about 8 a.m. outside the six-story red-brick building between Avenues A and B, and a dozen officers, many wearing heavy work gloves and carrying shovels, picks, hammers and other  equipment, went into the basement, a warren of small rooms.</p>
        <p>By midafternoon, the officers began rolling out barrels of ash and dirt, and chunks of rusted iron that were pieces of the old coal-fired boiler, unused since a new boiler was installed in 1998, the inspector said.</p>
        <p>No one in the building could recall Mr. Ramos. But Victor Serrano, 36, who lives across the street at No. 241 and was a teenager in 1979, said that he remembered the man. He said he lived on the second or third floor of No. 234, but seemed more like a homeless person.</p>
        <p>''He used to come with a supermarket cart,'' Mr. Serrano said. ''He was always friendly with all the kids,'' to whom he sometimes gave toys. ''But I never got friendly with him,'' Mr. Serrano said. ''He always spooked me.''</p>
