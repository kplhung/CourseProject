        <p>WERE the books ever honest at CUC International?</p>
        <p>The biggest accounting fraud ever -- one that cost investors $19 billion and involved more than $500 million in phony profits over just three years, now turns out to have gone on almost forever.</p>
        <p>Cosmo Corigliano was a 23-year-old accountant for Ernst &amp; Whinney when he joined CUC in 1983, the same year it went public. ''The activities had started about then,'' Mr. Corigliano told Judge William H. Walls this week, as he pleaded guilty to fraud charges.</p>
        <p>Faking the numbers, he said, ''was my job, and my superiors were encouraging me.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Corigliano, who rose to become CUC's chief financial officer, is likely to end up in prison. He and a number of his subordinates are cooperating with prosecutors, who are clearly gunning for his bosses at CUC.</p>
        <p>But for investors, the most interesting question is not whether Walter A. Forbes, CUC's founder, will go to jail. It is how this fraud managed to go on so long. The Securities and Exchange Commission is sure it started by the late 1980's and thinks it may have begun in 1985 or before. It ended in 1998, after CUC merged with HFS to form the Cendant Corporation and a CUC accountant spilled the beans.</p>
        <p>For all those years, the books were audited by Ernst &amp; Young or its predecessor, Ernst &amp; Whinney. In hindsight, they missed more than a few red flags. A report by Arthur Andersen, another accounting firm hired after the fraud was exposed, described meetings in which Ernst &amp; Young officials asked questions and got odd answers. In one case, there was no explanation or documentation for $25 million in profits. The auditors decided that was not a material amount, and let it go. The Andersen report did not criticize Ernst &amp; Young, but that was no surprise. Ernst &amp; Young had refused to supply information to Andersen until it was promised that the report would not comment on the quality of the Ernst &amp; Young audits.</p>
        <p>The S.E.C. says that the fraud was easier to pull off because CUC officials knew which subsidiaries would be audited, and therefore hid the most obvious frauds in subsidiaries that they knew the auditors would not look at.</p>
        <p>As the fraud grew, CUC's old tactics of inflating revenues and suppressing expenses were no longer adequate. So it took to manipulating merger reserves, which are supposed to cover one-time costs related to takeovers and are often ignored by investors. The reserves became a cookie jar in which operating losses could be fraudulently concealed. Unfortunately for CUC, some of its acquisitions were such dogs that the merger reserves were soon exhausted, making it necessary to make more acquisitions.</p>
        <p>Did the auditors know what was going on? They deny it, and there is no proof they did. But they didn't show much suspicion when confronted with some odd-looking transfers of funds between various accounts. Abraham Briloff, an emeritus professor of accounting at Baruch College, studied the Andersen report and concluded that ''the auditors were fooled because, in some measure at least, they wanted to be fooled.'' Had they blown the whistle, people would have asked why they had not done so years earlier.</p>
        <p>That is not, needless to say, the way they see it at Ernst &amp; Young. ''That suggestion is offensive,'' said Kathryn Oberly, the firm's general counsel. ''The CUC people were so determined to fool the auditors that they could fool any audit firm or any team of auditors.''</p>
        <p>Investors may not find that especially reassuring.</p>
