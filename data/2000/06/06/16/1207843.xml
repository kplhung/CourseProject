        <p>Everybody has a breaking point, Chuck Knoblauch said last month after his throwing jitters resurfaced, and the Yankees' second baseman apparently reached his after his problems erupted worse than ever last night. After throwing away three balls in the first six innings of last night's 12-3 loss to the Chicago White Sox, Knoblauch left the game. Then he left Yankee Stadium as well, walking out in his street clothes while the game was in progress.</p>
        <p>Joe Torre said he had no reason to believe that Knoblauch would not be at Yankee Stadium tonight when the Yankees play the White Sox again. However, Torre and the Yankee players spoke uncertainly of Knoblauch's future, other than to express their belief that the team needs him.</p>
        <p>''We all hope he doesn't make a rash decision under stress or emotion,'' David Cone said.</p>
        <p>The Yankees made a pitching change in the sixth inning, shortly after Knoblauch made his third error of the night, and while the rest of the infielders gathered at the mound and three outfielders met in center field, Knoblauch stood alone at second base, his hands on his hips, his frustration apparent in his expression. The inning ended on a ground ball to the shortstop Derek Jeter, Knoblauch circling behind first base to back up the play, as he has done so many times in his 10-year career.</p>
        <p>Holding his glove in his right hand, Knoblauch descended the dugout steps and said something to Torre as he passed the manager on the bench before both headed for the runway that leads to the clubhouse. Torre returned shortly thereafter; Knoblauch did not.</p>
        <p>One member of the organization said Knoblauch was visibly upset in the clubhouse, breaking some items.</p>
        <p>Within minutes, Knoblauch left Yankee Stadium, according to uniformed personnel, and was driven away from the park by a clubhouse attendant.</p>
        <p>Torre said that when Knoblauch beckoned him into the runway, the second baseman was ''hurting.''</p>
        <p>Knoblauch told Torre that he was hurting the team, and Torre said he cut off Knoblauch at that point and told him to go home immediately to avoid the crowd of reporters that would surround his locker after the game.</p>
        <p>Torre said he intended to call Knoblauch after reaching home last night. ''I hope he sleeps on it and realizes the most important thing is that everybody here is on his side,'' Torre said, ''and we all want him to feel better about this thing.''</p>
        <p>Knoblauch said last month that he had two possible career paths: either he would solve his throwing problems, or he would ''take it to the house'' -- as in quit baseball. There was no immediate word during the game from the Yankees about what Knoblauch's intentions were when he left the field.</p>
        <p>Knoblauch, who turns 32 next month, has the rest of this season and next season on his current contract, at $6 million a year. Shortly after the Yankees traded for him in February 1998, an agreement -- never announced -- was made to pay him $9 million annually for the 2002 and 2003 seasons.</p>
        <p>Knoblauch has played in four All-Star Games, collected 1,584 career hits and ranked among the game's best leadoff hitters since he broke into the majors in 1991, successes he has reminded himself of constantly since he began having throwing trouble in 1998.</p>
        <p>But Knoblauch has eight throwing errors in his last 21 games, and 12 errors over all this season.</p>
        <p>Knoblauch made several nice plays in games against Boston on Tuesday and Wednesday. But his throwing problem erupted fully last night, just one inning after he made a nice scoop and throw on a grounder hit by Herbert Perry.</p>
        <p>Leading off the third inning, Ray Durham smacked a hard grounder directly at Knoblauch, who fielded it easily before stepping and throwing to first base. All season long, Knoblauch has tried to throw the ball harder, rather than loop it tentatively.</p>
        <p>But this throw was far to the left of first baseman Tino Martinez, who came off the bag to catch the ball, and he was unable to tag Durham passing by. There was a burst of murmurs and jeers, and some booing when Knoblauch ran off the field.</p>
        <p>Two innings later, Paul Konerko was on third with two outs when Carlos Lee grounded to Knoblauch. It was another easy play, but Knoblauch again threw wide of Martinez, pulling him off the base. The boos from the Stadium crowd were louder this time, and they continued when Knoblauch led off the bottom of the fifth.</p>
        <p>The error that drove him from the field occurred the next inning. With runners at first and second, Frank Thomas hit a routine double-play grounder at Jeter, and the shortstop shoveled the ball to Knoblauch. With the runner closing on him -- but not enough to really impede the throw -- Knoblauch fired far to Martinez's right, the ball eluding the dive of the first baseman. Durham, who had been at second, raced around third and scored, to a torrent of boos.</p>
        <p>''It's a tough situation,'' Jeter said, ''but you've got to support people when they're up and when they're down. The ball up the middle was a tough play, and he made it look easier by getting there. And the double play, that's the hardest thing to do in baseball, so to be honest with you, I think he made only one bad throw today.''</p>
        <p>Jeter also indicated that the fans should go a little easier on the second baseman. ''It's frustrating, and the fans got on him,'' Jeter said. ''But if we're going to win, we're going to need Chuck. We're here to support him, and I think it's about time the fans do the same.''</p>
        <p>Knoblauch made a throwing error against the White Sox May 24, and after that game he suggested he would quit baseball if he couldn't conquer the problem.</p>
        <p>''I don't need this,'' Knoblauch said at the time. ''I'm not out here for the money. I'm out here to have fun. I don't need the money. I don't need this.''</p>
        <p>Knoblauch was asked at the time if he was close to the breaking point. ''Pretty close,'' he replied.</p>
