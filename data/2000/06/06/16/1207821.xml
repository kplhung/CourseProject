        <p>By all appearances, Ranch 1 Chicken Inc. had carved out a promising niche in the highly competitive fast-food market. Billing itself as a healthier alternative to most of its rivals, it was serving up grilled chicken-breast sandwiches in 58 restaurants, mostly around New York City, and had planned to expand rapidly throughout the country and internationally in airports, highway rest stops and amusement parks.</p>
        <p>''They were not a large company,'' said Thomas Miner, an owner of Technomic Inc., a food industry consulting firm in Chicago, ''but they were one we had identified as being a hot concept we were watching.''</p>
        <p>The first setback for Ranch 1 came in January, when the company canceled its plans for a public offering, saying the timing was not right. Worse news arrived Wednesday, when a federal indictment was unsealed that accused the company's chief executive, Sebastian Rametta, 34, of Staten Island, and its vice chairman, James F. Chickara, 45, of Holmdel, N.J., of being associates of the Colombo crime family.</p>
        <p>Although Ranch 1 itself was not accused of wrongdoing, the indictment claims that Mr. Rametta, known as Sebbie, and Mr. Chickara, who is also the president of World Gourmet Soups, a wholesaler, participated in a scheme with members of the Bonanno and Colombo crime families to secretly pay stock brokers exorbitant sales commissions to push shares in their private companies to unsuspecting customers. They were among dozens of people charged in what federal authorities characterized as one of organized crime's most wide-ranging assaults on the financial markets.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chickara's lawyer, G. Robert Gage Jr., could not be reached. But Edward J. M. Little, the lawyer for Mr. Rametta, said, ''Mr. Rametta is innocent of the charges and we intend to defend him to the utmost.''</p>
        <p>Raymond DioGuardi, the chief financial officer of Ranch 1, said, ''We're shocked, quite honestly, at the disclosure and the nature of the allegations.'' Mr. DioGuardi, who joined the company six months ago, said the company would conduct its own investigation of the charges.</p>
        <p>The indictment is unlikely to cost the company customers, said Arlene Spiegel, the director of the food and beverage practice at PricewaterhouseCoopers, the consulting company, but it is certain to crimp its efforts to grow by forging partnerships with other companies.</p>
        <p>Until the recent indictment, Ranch 1 had basked in publicity of a different sort. In 1996, New York magazine named it the best fast-food chain in the city. Last month, George A. Naddaff, the chairman of Ranch 1, and Mr. Rametta were named finalists for Ernst &amp; Young's Entrepreneur of the Year Award.</p>
        <p>The company reported losses of $17.6 million from 1996 to 1999, which Mr. DioGuardi attributed to the cost of expansion.</p>
        <p>Founded by two Israelis, Ranch 1 opened its first restaurant in 1990 next to the Ed Sullivan Theater on Broadway at 53rd Street. By 1996, when it was bought by Mr. Chickara and Mr. Rametta, the co-founders of Arnie's Bagelicious Bagels, a wholesale bakery, the chain had grown to 10 restaurants. Later that year, Mr. Chickara and Mr. Rametta brought in Mr. Naddaff, the founder of Boston Chicken (now Boston Market), as chairman. David Sculley, the former president of Heinz U.S.A., became a major investor.</p>
        <p>Food industry consultants say Ranch 1 appeals to customers because the chicken is grilled instead of fried. The chain also boasts that it takes only 45 seconds to fill an order.</p>
