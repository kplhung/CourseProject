        <p>Across the bloody fields of Scotland, in the land where the stage smoke swirls and the synthesizers scream like banshees, strides a faceless figure in black, thudding along in thick, corpse-kicking boots. Who is this masked man, speaking so portentously about how ''foul and fair'' his day has been? At last he raises the gleaming vizard of his helmet and there, behold, is a most familiar wide-browed visage: hey, it's one of America's most popular television stars, and, boy, does he look as if he means business.</p>
        <p>Such is the nearly anonymous entrance of Kelsey Grammer in the blunt-witted new production of ''Macbeth'' that opened last night at the Music Box Theater under the direction of Terry Hands.

        <p>Across the bloody fields of Scotland, in the land where the stage smoke swirls and the synthesizers scream like banshees, strides a faceless figure in black, thudding along in thick, corpse-kicking boots. Who is this masked man, speaking so portentously about how ''foul and fair'' his day has been? At last he raises the gleaming vizard of his helmet and there, behold, is a most familiar wide-browed visage: hey, it's one of America's most popular television stars, and, boy, does he look as if he means business.</p>
        <p>Such is the nearly anonymous entrance of Kelsey Grammer in the blunt-witted new production of ''Macbeth'' that opened last night at the Music Box Theater under the direction of Terry Hands. There seem to be at least two quite legitimate reasons for this semi-incognito first appearance in the tragedy's title role by Mr. Grammer, who is best known as the charmingly ineffectual shrink on the hit sitcom ''Frasier.''</p>
        <p>For one thing, it forestalls that disruptive shock of recognition that might prompt some rowdy theatergoer to yell out, ''Where's Niles?,'' in reference to Frasier's television brother. It allows the actor's voice, most un-Frasier-like here as it solemnly intones Macbeth's opening lines, to introduce his character without prejudice.</p>
        <p>What's more, in a play replete with images of dissembling -- in which people must ''make our faces vizards,'' in Macbeth's words -- introducing the ambitious Thane under wraps makes thematic sense. As Lady Macbeth (played here by Diane Venora) famously chastises her vacillating husband, his face ''is a book'' that is all too easy to read.</p>
        <p>Well, that's what the script says, anyway. To tell the truth, Mr. Grammer unmasked isn't that much more illuminating than he is with his visor down. It's not that he is crippled by his high Q rating. You don't think, ''Hey, look at old Frasier up there.'' On the other hand, you never for a second think that a complicated, conflicted character named Macbeth is up on the stage either, just an actor speaking lines in a melodious bass voice.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grammer is by no means ill at ease with Shakespearean speech. (He understudied the role of Macbeth in the ill-starred Vivian Beaumont production of 1981 and received good notices for his Cassio in the 1982 James Earl Jones-Christopher Plummer ''Othello.'') But he seems to have based his performance largely on the first words of Hamlet's advice to the traveling players -- ''Speak the speech, I pray you'' -- and then stopped right there.</p>
        <p>The same might be said of most of this production, in which crisp, even violent enunciation is the dominant characteristic. This is, after all, a ''Macbeth'' in which ''Lay on, Macduff'' is delivered not to Macduff but to the audience.</p>
        <p>Who says they don't do Shakespeare like they used to? Mr. Hands's staging of the canon's most compact and fastest-moving tragedy suggests what the barnstorming American companies of the 19th century must have been like: potboiler productions emphasizing melodrama over psychology, with a lot of stately actors planting themselves like trees at the edge of the stage and declaiming fiercely and nobly.</p>
        <p>Not that Mr. Hands, whose 1984 Broadway productions of ''Cyrano de Bergerac'' and ''All's Well That Ends Well'' for the Royal Shakespeare Company are still fondly remembered, neglects more contemporary touches. He and his designer, Timothy O'Brien, have conceived this production in chic, spare basic black, from the walls of the bare-bones set to the stark, funereal costumes that would blend in easily at any Chelsea opening.</p>
        <p>Another nod to more recent vintages of ''Macbeth'' is evident in those sinister muses, the three witches (Myra Lucretia Taylor, Starla Benford and Kelly Hutchinson), who again show up as battlefield scavengers, Mother Courage types gone toxic. (This is, for the record, at least the third such variation on this idea that I have seen.) They are, however, exceptionally loud and declamatory witches, in keeping with the evening's overall tone.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hands's general intent appears to have been to present ''Macbeth'' as straightforwardly as possible, letting the ever compelling story carry the audience along. Yet somehow this streamlined, intermissionless version, which weighs in under two hours, has a plodding quality that matches the lumbering and circular steps with which the actors have been encouraged to move.</p>
        <p>Part of this lethargy has to do with an overriding literal-mindedness. The sensibility comes across in the radio-play-style sound effects by Tom Morse. (When someone says, ''I hear horses,'' there is an immediate obliging clip-clop.) The same attitude surfaces more annoyingly in the annotative gestures of the acting. When Macbeth begs the earth not to hear his traitorous footsteps, he touches the ground; when he refers to the contents of his wife's heart, he touches his chest; when he wonders if that's a dagger he sees before him, he squints.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grammer basically has two gears here -- amoral, confident Macbeth and tender, contrite Macbeth -- and he has pretty much worn them out by the end of his second monologue. He also has a tendency, especially with Ms. Venora, to jump with both feet from one mood into the other, disregarding any steps between.</p>
        <p>Ms. Venora, a glamorous Shakespeare veteran who appears to better advantage as Gertrude in the current Ian Schraeger-style film version of ''Hamlet,'' at least conveys feelings of vicious ambition and disgusted horror in the same instant. But she casts her ambivalence with operatic grandeur and, like Mr. Grammer, she sounds all her notes early on.</p>
        <p>In their scenes together, as they jerk abruptly between rage and sorrow, contempt and affection, these Macbeths bring to mind Faye Dunaway in ''Chinatown,'' turning her face from side to side and repeating, ''She's my sister, she's my daughter.''</p>
        <p>They do, however, provide one electric moment. That's when Macbeth, having ''discovered'' the body of Duncan, describes the mutilated king in sensory detail to a horrified crowd while staring his wife hard in the eyes. It's a private coded declaration in a public situation. ''See what you've made me do,'' he seems to be saying. And it fully justifies Lady Macbeth's fainting in the next moment.</p>
        <p>To tell the truth, though, this was the only scene in the entire production that made me sit up straight and prick up my ears. The rest of the evening holds no surprises. No one else in the cast stands out, particularly, as being horribly embarrassing or wonderfully inspiring. As a result, a work that traditionally gallops off the page here does indeed creep in a petty pace from scene to scene.</p>

        <p>THEATER REVIEW  Correction:  June 19, 2000, Monday  A theater review of ''Macbeth'' in Weekend on Friday misidentified the director and misstated the year of a Royal Shakespeare Company production of ''All's Well That Ends Well'' on Broadway. It was directed in 1983 by Trevor Nunn, not in 1984 by Terry Hands (the director of the current ''Macbeth'').</p>
        <p>The review also misidentified the play that the company presented on Broadway in repertory with ''Cyrano de Bergerac'' in 1984. It was ''Much Ado About Nothing,'' not ''All's Well That Ends Well.''</p>
