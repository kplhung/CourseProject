        <p>By all accounts, it was almost impossible to dislike John Singer Sargent as a man. Henry James said of him in 1884, ''He has high talent, a charming nature and is civilized to his fingertips.''</p>
        <p>In all professional matters, he was a gifted strategist. Not the least of his triumphs was that he was succeeded by ideally dutiful descendants. They were anxious to find the best homes for what had been entrusted to them, rather than to sit on the heap of gold that it might have brought.</p>
        <p>Not being a marrying man, he left an unmarried sister, Emily Sargent, and a married sister, Violet Ormond. Mrs. Ormond (1870-1955) was exemplary in her guardianship of Sargent and his estate, as is her grandson Richard Ormond, co-author of the continuing ''Complete Paintings of Sargent.''</p>
        <p>Between 1925, when Sargent died, and 1937, museums in Boston, Washington and Harvard were given more than 1,000 of his drawings. But after Emily died in an accident in 1936 and Violet was about to turn 80, in 1949, it was decided that the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York should be offered the bulk of what remained of the estate. It was for the museum (whose director at the time, Francis Henry Taylor, was a distant cousin of Violet Ormond) to do with it whatever seemed best.</p>
        <p>The Metropolitan duly received a massive gift from the Sargent estate in June 1950. The gift included ''110 watercolors, a scrapbook containing about 140 sheets of drawings and sketches, a scrapbook containing 54 drawings and watercolors, and four sketchbooks'' and much else.</p>
        <p>It has taken exactly 50 years to sort it all out. In all, 341 items from the gift are included in the monumental catalog that has just been published by the Met (with 714 illustrations, 109 of them in color). And there is now a very large exhibition of watercolors and drawings from the Ormond bequest.</p>
        <p>Throughout his career, and with the possible exception of his enormous decorations for the Boston Public Library, Sargent knew when to start and when to stop. He also knew where to dig in, and when to move on. Even when he was still making his way, he knew how to produce work that in the words of one shrewd judge ''more or less kicked other people's pictures to pieces.''</p>
        <p>Above all, he did not like to get trapped in any one specialty. He was nature's tourist, and rarely at a loss for a telling image from his travels. And he was the portraitist whom everyone wanted, not simply because he could ''capture a likeness,'' but also because his portraits in oils would almost always radiate a certain moral security.</p>
        <p>He could go to a landscape unknown to him -- the English countryside, for instance -- and carry it off as if he had been there all his life. And whatever he let out of the studio had a certain immunity from the risks that bigger artists take. It is therefore legitimate to wonder what he was like when he was not ''on show.''</p>
        <p>Much of it can be seen in this exhibition's four distinct sections: Childhood and Youth (1856-74), Student Years and Early Career (1874-89), Professional Activity (1890-1925) and Records of Travel and Other Studies (1890-1925).</p>
        <p>The show is full of surprises, from the moment that Sargent in his 15th year was shaping up as a student of the high ground in Switzerland. The two drawings of white oxen in their blue-shadowed stable in Siena, dated around 1910, have a tranquil monumentality.</p>
        <p>These are true portraits (rather than ''paughtraits,' as Sargent used to call them, in exasperation at having to do so many of men and women). The oxen are rendered with a spontaneous affection that is not always found among the charcoal portraits on thick Whatman paper that he was to make by the score in London, allotting roughly two hours to each sitter. (As Stanley Olson says in his biography of Sargent, published in 1986, Sargent ''moved the production of likenesses into the realm of an hourly wage.'')</p>
        <p>Part of the fascination of this show is that it includes many memorable things that Sargent never thought of selling. As to why this was, all are free to speculate and none of us can be certain.</p>
        <p>A particularly striking example is the quite large group of drawings and sketches from Sargent's service as an official military artist from July 1910 onward. What was later asked of him was that he should in some way portray the joint activities and, if possible, the camaraderie of British and American troops in France. Initially he was not inclined to do it, on the grounds that he had never seen anything ''really horrible'' in his life and did not wish to risk the experience.</p>
        <p>It was arranged, however, that Sargent would not see too much action at close quarters. As he knew nothing of soldiers and soldiering and was initially a guest of the commander-in-chief of the British armies in France, with a comfortable bed and full board, he was not exactly in the thick of things. (One Sunday morning he overheard a regimental band playing on its way to church. ''I suppose there's no fighting on Sundays?'' said Sargent to his host.)</p>
        <p>In spite of this initial problem, the wartime material that was left to the Met includes some remarkably exact and well-conceived studies of forward areas in which the war was temporarily in abeyance. Dugouts, convoys of trucks, camps and a camouflaged field -- all were given his best efforts.</p>
        <p>The gentlest and least vicious of men, Sargent took human nature at its most presentable for his terrain. One or two of his other wartime studies present the front line as a place in which young men lay around in twos and threes, naked and in long grass, asleep as often as not.</p>
        <p>It is permissible to doubt that these were scenes that Sargent himself witnessed in France in the fall of 1918, though the subject matter recurs elsewhere in the show -- most notably in his watercolors of the black work force who were building a friend's villa in Florida in 1917. An almost sainted innocence is the mark of these studies.</p>
        <p>He could be very grand, too, when the subject encouraged it, as in the glorious ''Garden Near Lucca'' (circa 1910). The mix of sculpture, architecture and a cascade of convolvulus is one of Sargent's strongest inventions. The best things in this show take a little finding, but it's worth the trouble.</p>
        <p>''John Singer Sargent Beyond the Portrait Studio: Paintings, Drawings and Watercolors From the Collection'' is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Sept. 24.</p>
