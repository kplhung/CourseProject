        <p>The tour through the minefield began near one of the main roads, among the houses where the little children were playing.</p>
        <p>Mohid Hashim, who leads a mine-clearing team, shouted at the youngsters in Pashto, ''Hey, don't you know that red flag means it's dangerous here?''</p>
        <p>The children scurried away, but as always they would meander back. Housing is impossibly scarce here in war-devastated Kandahar, the second-largest of Afghanistan's cities. Several families have taken shelter surrounded by the rubble of what is called Minefield 179, willing to risk the explosives buried in their new backyard.</p>
        <p>Afghanistan, one of the world's most enduring battlegrounds, is also among its most booby-trapped landscapes. It has an estimated five million to seven million of the deadly devices concealed in the rocky soil -- about one for every three of the nation's people.</p>
        <p>But in a place where even a scrap of good news has become as rare as a peaceful summer, there is some cause for thanks. A mine-clearing operation, perhaps the largest in the world, has in 10 years reduced the number of maiming explosions by half. Each day now, only 10 to 12 people make a misstep that blows them apart.</p>
        <p>''Of course we are still scared of explosions, but I have eight children, and a father cannot keep that many small ones from running around,'' said Abdul Nabi, a poor laborer who has built a home in the minefield from stony debris and cornstalks.</p>
        <p>He had come out of his dark hovel into the fierce light. Two of his youngsters had been traipsing among the piles of crushed brick, chasing each other through a labyrinth of jagged half walls. About 15 yards from his door, a man in a hard white helmet was doing the tedious work of ''de-mining,'' carefully probing and digging.</p>
        <p>The father did not want to be harshly judged. This is Afghanistan, he explained, and there have been 21 straight years of war. Many of the ordinary rules of rational behavior have, by necessity, been abandoned.</p>
        <p>He shrugged defensively. ''Where else is there for us to live?'' he said. ''As they started clearing the mines, people began moving in. We have a good space here.''</p>
        <p>The ''de-miners'' work for various international charities under the auspices of the United Nations. There are 4,800 people involved, split into teams throughout the country. In 10 years, more than a million explosive devices have been safely exploded or dismantled, said Richard D. Kelly, who manages the program.</p>
        <p>Minefield 179, about the size of a football field, is among the last contaminated grounds within Kandahar. Excavation at the site has been going on for nearly a year.</p>
        <p>So far, 11 mines have been unearthed, as well as 80 ''UXO's,'' shorthand for ''unexploded ordnance,'' which includes rockets, bombs and grenades. Some 30,000 metal fragments have also been found. Those objects further slow the monotonous work, because each one has to be uncovered carefully to be sure that it is not deadly.</p>
        <p>Abdul Sattar is a merchant of some means, but even he decided to accept the risks of living in the minefield. His family owned property within No. 179. He rebuilt his house in 1996.</p>
        <p>He answered a knock on his handsomely painted front door. ''Yes, there is some danger, but it does not bother me,'' he said with more nonchalance than bravado. ''The U.N. found a mine under the corner of our house some time back, and the other day they found another one about 20 yards from here. But soon all the mines will be gone.''</p>
        <p>One of his five children stood with him. Just a few feet away, on the other side of a brick wall, one of the men in helmets was busy ferreting through the unpredictable soil.</p>
        <p>''It's all up to Allah,'' Mr. Sattar said of the danger. ''You must have faith.''</p>
        <p>Afghanistan is not alone in its land-mine infestation, though it is surely among the most afflicted. Estimating global numbers is very difficult, but Angola, Cambodia, Iraq and Egypt also finish near the top of most lists.</p>
        <p>Actually, large numbers are not as important as strategic location: how many people live near the minefield, how much fertile land is unusable.</p>
        <p>The Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979, and driving it out took a decade. The Soviet troops were orderly in configuring their minefields, forming broad protective arcs around key roads, cities and dams. The groups of Afghan mujahedeen, who battled each other after defeating the Soviet Army, were more haphazard with their placements -- indeed often random.</p>
        <p>They all used the gamut of insidious devices. Fragmentation mines leapt into the air, spraying a thousand steel splinters like little daggers. Blast mines tore off limbs while propelling dirt, gravel and bone fragments into the fresh wounds. Triggering mechanisms were often disguised as a pen or a pack of a popular brand of cigarettes.</p>
        <p>In 1998, most countries in the world signed a treaty renouncing use of antipersonnel mines, although those not signing included the United States, China and Russia. President Clinton pledged to join the majority by 2006, giving Washington time to develop alternatives to what is considered an important defensive weapon.</p>
        <p>Military observers say that a modest amount of mine installation continues in Afghanistan as the Taliban, who control most of the country, try to complete their conquest of a well-armed opposition. But most devices in the ground are the afterlife of earlier fighting.</p>
        <p>''I'm not one of them ban-the-mines people,'' said Ross Chamberlain, an Australian explosives expert who had joined the walk through No. 179. ''If someone's coming to attack your house, you've got a right to defend yourself any way you can. But do it right. If you've put mines in, it's your job then to take them out.''</p>
        <p>The men now taking them out in Afghanistan are local people, hired at a starting salary of $100 a month. This is a top wage these days, but the work is perilous, and there is no glamour to it -- no cinematic images of a heavily perspiring man snipping colored wires. The main danger comes from the boredom of sifting through dirt.</p>
        <p>So far this year, five de-miners have been killed in Afghanistan. ''One was sheer stupidity,'' Mr. Chamberlain said. ''The guy hit an antitank mine with a pick.''</p>
        <p>The tour continued. Minefields 178 and 180 looked a lot like No. 179. Minefield 232 was at the edge of the city in an open field with wheat planted nearby.</p>
        <p>The final stop was Kandahar's main hospital, back toward the center of town. The crowded wards in this city almost always have someone newly mutilated.</p>
        <p>On this day, there were two, and the one who was awake was Abdul Khaliq. He was 14 and scrawny, lying in a corner bed near a window.</p>
        <p>His left leg had been gone for two weeks. A bulky white bandage covered the stump, and every now and then he rubbed it with his fingers. His right leg and thighs and chest had also been hurt, but the most striking thing about him was the stunned look in his eyes, as if he were frozen in that instant he heard the blast and flipped into the air.</p>
        <p>It had happened as he ran up a small hill outside of the city, chasing friends over familiar ground. For years, they had crossed that terrain. Nothing before had ever exploded.</p>
        <p>''We were playing,'' he said weakly. ''We were playing.''</p>
