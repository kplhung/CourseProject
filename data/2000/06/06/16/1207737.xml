        <p>Fearing that new workfare requirements have forced poor college students on the welfare rolls to drop out of school,  the Legislature passed a bill today allowing such students to count internships and other work-study assignments toward the work requirements.</p>
        <p>The Giuliani administration and the City University of New York have long battled over whether college students who are on welfare should be bound by the same work requirements, known as workfare, as other recipients are.</p>
        <p>New York City and other local governments around the state typically require welfare recipients to work 20 or more hours per week in a workfare assignment to qualify for public-assistance benefits. The assignments usually range from doing clerical work in government agencies to cleaning public parks.</p>
        <p>Advocates for the poor argue that students required to participate in workfare should be permitted to count internships and other work-study assignments, but not regular course work, toward fulfilling their workfare obligations. They also contend that many students required to participate in workfare assignments are forced to drop out of college.</p>
        <p>Five years ago, before the workfare program was introduced in New York City, more than 10 percent of CUNY's student body -- some 28,000 students -- received public assistance. The number of welfare recipients at CUNY has shrunk by more than a third, to about 18,000, since workfare was instituted, according to lawmakers.</p>
        <p>Charles Deister, a spokesman for Gov. George E. Pataki, said today that the governor had not decided whether he will sign the legislation.</p>
        <p>But the Giuliani administration expressed concerns about the bill, saying that it did not allow the city to evaluate the kinds of internships and work-study programs that students would perform in place of their workfare assignments.</p>
        <p>Anthony Coles, a senior adviser to Mr. Giuliani, said the city did not oppose allowing college students on welfare to count internships and similar jobs toward fulfilling workfare obligations, as long as those jobs  provided ''real work experience.''</p>
        <p>''In the past, we have had reservations about whether CUNY could administer a workfare program that met the requirements of the new welfare law,'' he said. ''It's up to CUNY to do a good work-study program.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Coles maintained that it ought to be up to city welfare officials to decide what internships and programs would fulfill the requirements. ''We want the right to approve the program,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The legislation passed today comes three years after the governor and the Legislature approved a law that would require welfare officials to place students in workfare jobs on college campuses so they can continue their studies. At the time, CUNY officials argued that students asked to juggle both off-campus jobs and college classes had trouble staying in school.</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 19, 2000, Monday  An article on Friday about a bill in Albany to let college students count internships and other work-study programs toward the workfare requirements they must meet to get public assistance misstated the number of welfare recipients attending the City University. It is 7,569, not 18,000.</p>
