        <p>QUEENS: DOCTORS CONVICTED  Two doctors with troubled medical histories were convicted Wednesday in State Supreme Court in Queens of practicing medicine without authorization. Dr. Ana Marie Santi, 61, had her license to administer anesthesia suspended in 1998 after the death of a patient undergoing liposuction. Dr. Peter Corines, 51, had his license revoked last year, though the revocation had been stayed for a period. Dr. Corines owns Surgical Consultants P.C., an outpatient clinic in Queens, and had hired Dr. Santi even though he knew her license was suspended, the jury found. Both doctors face up to four years in prison.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: YOUTH COMMISSIONER  Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has appointed Jerry Cammarata, left, an ally on the Board of Education, as commissioner of the city's Department of Youth and Community Development. He replaces Martin Oesterreich, who left last year to head the Department of Homeless Services. Mr. Cammarata, a speech pathologist, said yesterday that he would give up a $15,000 annual stipend from the Board of Education but keep his seat, which he has held since 1995. A Staten Island resident, he will earn $133,000 overseeing a $140 million annual budget for youth programs and community development projects, including adult literacy programs.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: COUPLE CONVICTED  A Bronx couple accused of forcing two Nigerian immigrants to be their personal servants were convicted of involuntary servitude. The convictions, on Wednesday, came after a prosecutor told the jury in Federal District Court that Prosper and Ifeoma Udogwu had badly mistreated two girls, 10 and 13. Mrs. Udogwu was a child welfare worker when the couple arranged to bring the girls from Nigeria.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: OFFICER SUES  A former police officer fired for shooting an unarmed squeegee man is suing to get his job back. The former officer, Michael Meyer, was acquitted last year of criminal charges in the 1998 off-duty shooting of Antoine Reid. In papers filed Wednesday in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, Mr. Meyer said the internal departmental trial that led to his firing was prejudiced because of ''the extraordinary amount of adverse publicity.'' On June 14, 1998, Mr. Reid tried to wash the windshield of Mr. Meyer's car, which led to a confrontation. The former officer fired a single shot into Mr. Reid's chest.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: STRIKE PRESSURES RISING  Leaders of Local 1-2 of the Utility Workers of America said yesterday that chances were growing that the union would go on strike on June 25 against KeySpan Energy, a new company that produces 25 percent of New York City's energy. Jerry Waters, a vice president of the local, said KeySpan's negotiators walked out of a bargaining session on Monday but were hinting that they wanted to resume talks. ''We're miles apart from a settlement,'' he said. The local's contract expires on June 25 with Consolidated Edison and three other companies that have entered the New York market as a result of industry deregulation: KeySpan, Orion Power Holdings and the NRG Energy unit of Northern States Power.</p>

        <p>NEW JERSEY</p>
        <p>TRENTON: TRANSPORT BILL  Republican leaders agreed yesterday to funnel $3.75 billion over the next four years to continue a statewide road and transportation building program. Differences between bills pending in the State Senate and Assembly had delayed a decision on how much the Transportation Trust Fund would get. The compromise bill requires lawmakers to vote on any new highway and caps salaries, operating expenses and the amount the state can borrow.</p>

        <p>TRENTON: BEAR HUNT OPPOSED  Gov. Christine Todd Whitman has asked state officials to halve  plans for a large-scale hunt to thin New Jersey's growing bear population, and a Senate panel has cleared a bill to ban the hunts. The State Fish and Game Council has proposed allowing 350 bears to be killed, more than a third of the state's estimated 1,000 bears. Governor Whitman wants only 175 bears hunted. Homeowners and farmers have complained that bears have threatened children and killed livestock.  Steve Strunsky (NYT)</p>
        <p>HACKENSACK: TEACHER ARRESTED  A 27-year-old teacher was arrested yesterday on charges that he had sex with a 14-year-old student at the teacher's home in East Rutherford and at Hackensack Middle School. The teacher, Jeffrey Levine, was charged with aggravated sexual assault and endangering the welfare of a child, the Bergen County prosecutor's office announced. Phone messages left at Mr. Levine's home were not returned. The student was not identified.</p>

        <p>TRENTON: SEX OFFENDER BILL  With no debate, the State Assembly agreed to make New Jersey the first state with a constitutional amendment guaranteeing that details about convicted sex offenders can be posted online. Yesterday's 72-to-2 vote put the measure one step closer to voters, who have ultimate authority on amendments. The amendment would allow the state to post on the Internet the names, addresses, physical descriptions and criminal histories of convicted sex offenders who fall under a local notification procedure known as Megan's Law.</p>

        <p>HADDAM: NUCLEAR PLANT PHASE-OUT  The Connecticut Yankee nuclear power plant has been disconnected from the power grid as a safety measure as workers pull down miles of wires as part of the decommissioning of the plant. The plant's four steam generators have already been removed, and work crews are now focused on the heart of the nuclear plant. Northeast Utilities, the plant's chief owner, decided in 1996 to decommission the plant because it was not economically feasible to keep it running.</p>
