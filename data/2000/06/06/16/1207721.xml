        <p>Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has proposed an innovative and ambitious plan to enroll some 900,000 eligible but uninsured New York City residents in Medicaid and other government health insurance programs. He cites his own experience with prostate cancer as one reason he has become more attuned to the needs of the uninsured.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's illness caused him to withdraw from the Senate race, but that difficult decision has now made it possible for him to devote his administrative talents to solving a significant social problem. His new plan, if successful, could be a model for the rest of the nation and become one of his most important legacies to the city.</p>

        <p>Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has proposed an innovative and ambitious plan to enroll some 900,000 eligible but uninsured New York City residents in Medicaid and other government health insurance programs. He cites his own experience with prostate cancer as one reason he has become more attuned to the needs of the uninsured.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's illness caused him to withdraw from the Senate race, but that difficult decision has now made it possible for him to devote his administrative talents to solving a significant social problem. His new plan, if successful, could be a model for the rest of the nation and become one of his most important legacies to the city.</p>
        <p>This is an interesting and positive departure for a mayor who has favored tightening social service programs and indeed has been criticized for being too tough on welfare recipients. No new program would be created, and federal and state governments will pay most of the costs for new enrollees.  But the city's share could amount to more than $150 million as enrollment increases.</p>
        <p>Currently there are an estimated 1.5 million low-income uninsured individuals in the city. More than half could have health insurance under existing public programs. More than 200,000 very-low-income children and adults in the city are eligible for Medicaid coverage but are not enrolled. Hundreds of thousands of other low-income children are eligible for subsidized health insurance under Child Health Plus, a state-run program, and by next January, thousands of low-income adults will also become eligible for subsidized care under Family Health Plus, a new state program.</p>
        <p>Yet these eligible individuals -- two-thirds of whom are working -- are not enrolled because they do not know about these programs, or have been put off from seeking coverage in light of city efforts to reduce welfare rolls and other public services. Finding these individuals and helping them sign up is a bureaucratic challenge.</p>
        <p>Though some nonprofit groups are trying to help families enroll, private groups do not have the resources to reach large numbers of people. Mr. Giuliani's plan would take a systematic citywide approach, setting up shop in schools, firehouses, housing developments and other places where people can obtain information. Like the successful ''Compstat'' model used by police to monitor crime hot spots, the plan will use continuous tracking of enrollments. The city will be divided into eight ''Health Stat'' regions, each with a manager. The city will hold weekly meetings to monitor the number of uninsured being signed up and assess tactics.</p>
        <p>This project will require investment for training and outreach workers. The payback in benefits to low-income children and working families that need insurance will far outweigh those costs.</p>
