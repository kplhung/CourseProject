        <p>Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.</p>
        <p>LOUIS ARMSTRONG CENTENNIAL BAND, La Belle Epoque, 827 Broadway, at 12th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 254-6436. Led by the tubaist David Ostwald, the group has long been known as the Gully Low Jazz Band but has changed its name for an important year of Armstrongiana (including a regular early-evening residency on Tuesdays that it started recently at Birdland). The players are faithful interpreters of Armstrong's early period and include some great musicians: the clarinetist Ken Peplowski, the guitarist Howard Alden, the drummer Alvester Garnett, and sometimes the great Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra trombonist Wycliffe Gordon. Music is on Sunday from noon to 4 p.m.; admission is $35 (Ben Ratliff).</p>

        <p>Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.</p>
        <p>LOUIS ARMSTRONG CENTENNIAL BAND, La Belle Epoque, 827 Broadway, at 12th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 254-6436. Led by the tubaist David Ostwald, the group has long been known as the Gully Low Jazz Band but has changed its name for an important year of Armstrongiana (including a regular early-evening residency on Tuesdays that it started recently at Birdland).

Music is on Sunday from noon to 4 p.m.; admission is $35 (Ben Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* SUSANA BACA, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8777. Susana Baca has made musicological studies of Afro-Peruvian songs; she has also followed her clear, knowing voice in less purist directions, fusing the modal delicacy of her Peruvian band with New York musicians. For these shows, her band will be joined by David Byrne and Marc Ribot on guitars and John Medeski on keyboards. Tonight at 8 and 10; admission is $30 (Jon Pareles).</p>
        <p>CYRO BAPTISTA AND BEAT THE DONKEY, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. The Brazilian percussionist Cyro Baptista has an ear for syncopation and timbre and a smart sense of humor. Beat the Donkey is his 10-member percussion ensemble, with an international assortment of musicians. Its guest for two shows is the guitarist Marc Ribot, who can make his instrument croon or clank; after performing on Mr. Baptista's twisted tribute album for Villa-Lobos, ''Vira Loucos,'' he clearly understands Mr. Baptista's timing and respect for melody. Sunday at 8 and 10 p.m.; tickets are $10 in advance, $12 on Sunday (Pareles).</p>
        <p>BLACK EYED PEAS, S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940. To say they are energetic doesn't begin to describe the three Los Angeles-based hip-hoppers in Black Eyed Peas, who simply put on one of the most dynamic shows in the genre. Dancing, freestyling, beat-tossing -- it all happens in overdrive at a Black Eyed Peas show. This show will probably introduce music from the group's long-awaited second album, ''Bridging the Gap,'' due in August on the Atomic Pop label. Sunday at 9 p.m.; admission is $18 (Ann Powers).</p>
        <p>MARY J. BLIGE, Radio City Music Hall, 1260 Avenue of the Americas, at 50th Street, (212) 247-4777. The queen of hip-hop soul returns for a summer visit, and her subjects will surely turn out to pay homage. A Mary J. Blige concert is a tidal experience; the singer washes over you with the force of her voice and her emotions, and her fans surge right back. Expect plenty from ''Mary'' (MCA), her latest release and an artistic milestone. With Jagged Edge and Carl Thomas. Tomorrow and Sunday at 8 p.m.; tickets are $38 to $78 (Powers).</p>
        <p>BOWERY ELECTRIC, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3055. This Brooklyn-based duo mixes expansive electronic rhythms with lush melodies, swelling drones and hypnotic female vocals. This sound was once experimental, but now it has become an established way of remaking rock. Give Bowery Electric credit for keeping it fresh in subtle ways. With Datachi and Calla. Tomorrow at 9 p.m.; admission is $12 (Powers).</p>
        <p>R. L. BURNSIDE, HUBERT SUMLIN, Summerstage, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 72nd Street, Central Park, (212) 360-2777. It's almost worth hoping the weather stays muggy for this show, just to conjure the appropriate deep, sweaty feeling for an afternoon of gut-wrenching blues. R. L. Burnside, from northern Mississippi, is one of the leading survivors of the Mississippi Delta scene, and he is adventurous enough to have experimented with whippersnappers like Beck and Jon Spencer. Hubert Sumlin was the man worthy of playing guitar next to Howlin' Wolf for many years. These two masters will be joined by a cadre of stars, including David Johansen, Levon Helm and Jimmy Vivino. Tomorrow at 3 p.m.; free (Powers).</p>
        <p>* CACHAO, CHICO O'FARRILL BIG BAND, Central Park Summerstage, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 72d Street, (212) 360-2777. This double bill presents two vectors into Afro-Cuban jazz. The bassist Israel Lopez, nicknamed Cachao, perfected the springy, laconic bass lines that drive Cuban dance bands, and in the 1950's he was an instigator of the descarga, a jazz-tinged Latin jam session. The conga virtuoso Carlos Valdez, or Patato, will be sitting in. Chico O'Farrill was a pioneer in Afro-Cuban jazz arranging, and his big band is a disciplined, rip-roaring ensemble with Cuban rhythms as its sparkplug. Sunday at 3 p.m.; free (Pareles).</p>
        <p>FREDDY COLE QUARTET, Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue, above Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 242-1785. Through a series of records on the Fantasy label, Mr. Cole has strengthened his career as a suave, rhythmically sure jazz singer; comparisons with his brother, the late Nat (King) Cole, are no longer necessary. Sets tonight and tomorrow night are at 9, 11 and 12:30 a.m.; Sunday night sets are at 9 and 11. Cover charge tonight and tomorrow is $20 , Sunday $17.50; $10 minimum. (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* BOBBY HUTCHERSON, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037. It's possible that Mr. Hutcherson, the vibraphonist, has never put in a bad performance as he has made his way through several different varieties of the ''new thing'' in jazz in the 1960's and finally as a master of the mainstream. He is a musician of graceful temperament and precise technique, and his band this week includes the pianist George Cables, the bassist Santi Debriano and the drummer Carl Allen. Sets through Sunday are at 9:30 and 11:30 p.m., with a late set tonight and tomorrow night at 1; cover charge is $20 (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>FREEDY JOHNSTON, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (212) 477-8150. Freedy Johnston's finely turned folk-rock songs have carefully balanced melodies that he sings in a winsome tenor. But for all their classic symmetry, they're the confessions of some desperate, unsavory and unbalanced characters. Tonight at 9; admission is $10 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>SHANE MCGOWAN AND THE POPES, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-1224. Is it ethical to recommend a Shane McGowan show? The leader of the Pogues and later the Popes has been so apparently drunk in recent New York performances that he has barely made it through the show. Yet there is no denying his great artistry, when he manages to stay awake onstage. And there is no doubt his loyal fans will turn out to cheer his every self-destructive move. Tomorrow at 8 p.m.; tickets are $30 in advance, $35 day of show (Powers).</p>
        <p>RICKY MARTIN, Nassau Coliseum, Uniondale, N.Y., (516) 794-9300. Beyond his open-mouthed grin and his shaking bonbons, Ricky Martin has a mission: to unite the Americas as one giant commercial pop market. He's a trouper onstage, working hard to stoke the party. Tonight at 8; tickets are $35 to $95 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>MYRA MELFORD'S SAME RIVER, TWICE, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501. Ms. Melford, the pianist, has diversified in the last few years, forming several different bands at once. This is the main project, a quintet with chamber-music tendencies but new-jazz energy, including the cellist Erik Friedlander, the trumpeter Cuong Vu, the clarinetist Chris Speed and the drummer Michael Sarin. Sets are tomorrow night at 8 and 10; tickets are $10 (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>STEVE MILLER BAND, GOVERNMENT MULE, Jones Beach, Meadowbrook Parkway South, Wantagh, N.Y., (516) 221-1000. Up jumps the boogie at this summer celebration of things borrowed and blue. One generation of white blues innovators passes it on to the next as Steve Miller, who has watched his jumpy guitar and poppy songwriting scale the charts many times, shares bandleading duties with Warren Haynes, who graduated from a youthful apprenticeship with the Allman Brothers to the sweet spot in his own Southern-fried band, Government Mule. An extra treat: the harmonica king Norton Buffalo, a Miller mainstay. Tonight at 8; admission is $32 to $42 (Powers).</p>
        <p>* HANK MOBLEY 70TH BIRTHDAY FEST, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. This week, organized by Don Sickler, the polymath arranger, educator, record producer, music publisher and trumpet player, pays homage to one of the great saxophonists of the post-bop era. Using Mobley's arrangements and the repertory of some of his best old Blue Note records, the band includes -- at different times during the week -- the saxophonists Joe Lovano, Jimmy Green and James Spaulding; the pianists Ronny Mathews, John Hicks; the bassist Ron Carter; and the drummer Winard Harper. Sets tonight and tomorrow night are at 8 and 10:30, with a $25 cover; Sunday night sets are at 7 and 9, with an $18 cover (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>PIETASTERS, EDNA'S GOLDFISH, CATCH-22, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-1224. Ska will not die as long as young fans like to don porkpie hats and bop to its fractured beats. This show is a fine representation of the subgenre's current style. The Pietasters, from Washington, add playful soul bits into the mix; the appealingly earnest Edna's Goldfish, from Long Island, take it toward pop. New Jersey's Catch-22 is a little bit punk. Tonight at 8; admission is $12 (Powers).</p>
        <p>* ''PORGY AND BESS''/''SKETCHES OF SPAIN,'' JVC Jazz Festival, Carnegie Hall, 881 Seventh Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 247-7800. Two great, popular monuments of jazz since the dawn of the LP era, the Miles Davis-Gil Evans collaborations on ''Porgy and Bess'' and ''Sketches of Spain,'' found their way into all kinds of different record collections. They're rather bold, early concept albums, and they're for everyone, from jazz to pop to classical music enthusiasts. Here, the highly regarded composer and arranger Maria Schneider, who studied with Evans, will conduct the band through Evans's original arrangements; the trumpeter Jon Faddis will play the Miles Davis role. The concert is Sunday night at 8; tickets are $20 to $55 (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>ROYAL TRUX, JUCIFER, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3055. Neil Hagerty and Jennifer Herrema have been making psychotronic meltdowns out of classic rock for years now; some might still say the duo should be institutionalized, but in underground circles they are an institution. Behind the aviator shades, they're really autodidact intellectuals creating a warped pop culture of their own. For this show, Royal Trux is joined by Jucifer, another male-female duo with a yen for scratchy rock and a sweet streak that makes it more than a Melvins imitator. With Burning Brides. Tonight at 9; admission is $10 (Powers).</p>
        <p>CLEM SNIDE, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. Eef Barzelay and his mates continue their swooning path through dreams of Americana on Clem Snide's latest release, ''Your Favorite Music'' (Sire). Aficionados of drowsy pop particularly like the band's cover of the Ritchie Valens classic ''Donna.'' Tonight at midnight; admission is $5 (Powers).</p>
        <p>* SONIC YOUTH, PETER BROTZMANN CHICAGO TENTET PLUS TWO, Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 564-4882. With concise rock songs or far-reaching jams, Sonic Youth celebrates the electronic maelstrom within the guitar. Its long instrumental stretches ride an inexorable beat through feedback, dissonance, metallic clanks, seesawing glissandos and resonating drones. The music peals and claws and fills a room with hyperactive overtones. To bring out its kinship with avant-garde jazz, Sonic Youth is sharing the bill with the saxophonist Peter Brotzmann, who honks and shrieks and muscles his way through improvisations, and a large ensemble featuring some of Chicago's leading jazz experimenters. Tomorrow at 7 p.m.; tickets are $20.</p>
        <p>* SUPER FURRY ANIMALS, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, at the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. One of the Welsh bands that emerged in the mid-1990's, Super Furry Animals hopscotch through rock to play whatever they want, whether it's glam or garage-rock or psychedelia or techno with a Hawaiian guitar sample. There's plenty of melody, humor and unabashed affection behind the unhinged style-hopping. Tonight at 9; admission is $12 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* ''TANGO: PASSION AND SWING,'' JVC Jazz Festival, Carnegie Hall, 881 Seventh Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 247-7800. Tango and jazz have gone together rather naturally ever since the tango rhythm became popular in New Orleans at the beginning of the century. And American jazz players have enjoyed crossing over to the Argentine side, most notably the vibraphonist Gary Burton. Mr. Burton will be on hand for this concert, as will the saxophonist Joe Lovano, the accordionist Pablo Ziegler and the Quintet for New Tango, and the saxophonist Paquito D'Rivera. Singers and dancers from the theatrical productions ''Forever Tango'' and ''Tango Argentino'' will also be included. The concert is tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $20 to $50 (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* TINA TURNER, LIONEL RICHIE, Continental Airlines Arena, East Rutherford, N.J., (212) 307-7171. At the center of a lavish rock spectacle, Tina Turner plays her archetype to the hilt. She's the indomitable woman, scarred but never defeated, strutting and singing in a voice that won't give in. Lionel Richie, on his latest comeback tour, showers the audience with old hits and shameless blandishments. The concert is tonight, ticket are $45.25 to $125.25 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>TRIBUTE TO ROBERT JOHNSON, JVC Jazz Festival, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400. The bluesman Robert Johnson endures, and will always transfix young blues scholars with his handful of songs, among the most intense little bodies of work ever created in popular music. This concert includes interpretations of Johnson by the singers and guitarists Honeyboy Edwards, John Hammond, Guy Davis, Robert Jr. Lockwood and -- the nontraditionalist of the lot -- the stunning Chris Whitley, whose career always seems to be on the rise but never gets to where it deserves to be. The concert is tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $31 (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>BOBBY WATSON AND HORIZON, JVC Jazz Festival, Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, 515 Lenox Avenue, at 135th Street, Harlem. A Father's Day special has been a regular part of George Wein's JVC festival for some years now, and this year the draw to an affordable show at a good, underrecognized venue is Mr. Watson, the saxophonist who was one of the stars of jazz in the 1980's. The current version of his band Horizon includes the pianist Orrin Evans, a hard-hitting Monklike player who never fails to tear it up on stage. The concert is Sunday at 3 p.m.; tickets are $12 (Ratliff).</p>
