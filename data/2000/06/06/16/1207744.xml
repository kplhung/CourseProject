        <p>The agreement signed at the summit meeting in Pyongyang on Wednesday, just days shy of the 50th anniversary of the start of the Korean War, was brimming with words that heralded the arrival of peace. Yet the two countries are still technically at war, and no one wants to raise the question of who would govern a unified nation.</p>
        <p>Japan's prime minister likened the breakthrough to the fall of the Berlin Wall, yet the DMZ remains firmly in place, an ugly barbed-wire scar across the Korean peninsula. There is no popular uprising against the Communist government in the North, and no serious discussion of removing the troops and weaponry that line both sides of the border.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, American officials trying today to puzzle their way through North Korea's apparent, or at least public, change of attitude said they saw the first real glimmer of hope that one of the last remnants of the cold war could gradually erode, and that North Korea might soon be regarded less as a rogue state and more like just another failed state.</p>
        <p>''Exactly what's going on is hard to read,'' said Nicholas Eberstadt, a longtime Korea scholar at the American Enterprise Institute here. ''Kim Jong Il proved that he really is a moviemaker, and he made himself the star,'' Mr. Eberstadt said, referring to the North Korean leader's obsession with the cinema, which once led him to kidnap a South Korean director and a famous actress to build him a film industry.</p>
        <p>But no one in Washington pretends to understand the rest of the script in Mr. Kim's latest production. In meetings at the White House and the State Department today, some wondered aloud whether the sudden emergence of the reclusive North Korean leader was a one-time anomaly or a radical change of strategy.</p>
        <p>Is he prepared to pull his troops back from the demilitarized zone and dismantle the tens of thousands of mortar and missiles that could destroy Seoul in an hour? And, if so, should the United States be ready to talk about pulling its 37,000 troops out of the Korean peninsula, as the North has demanded for years? Could a country whose major export consists of missiles and arms shipped to the Middle East break off that arms trade, or satisfy the United States that it should be removed from the State Department's list of terrorist nations?</p>
        <p>If its actions match its good words, the desperately poor country will suddenly be eligible for a range of international goodies, including aid from the World Bank and the I.M.F. But the aid would inevitably come attached to communications technology, an influx of foreigners and outside ideas -- all anathema in a country where radios can only be tuned to the official government stations.</p>
        <p>''This clearly has to be taken as a change in North Korean tactics in how to engage the world,'' said Robert Gallucci, who negotiated the 1994 deal with North Korea to freeze its nuclear program and is now the dean of Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service. ''Whether it is a strategic change, or whether this is truly a new North Korean approach to the world, it is simply too early to know. There is a lot of history here -- war, terrorism, nuclear ambitions, incidents at sea -- that suggests the need for a lot of caution.''</p>
        <p>None of those issues were discussed at length at the summit meeting. But South Korean officials who telephoned Washington today said Kim Dae Jung had raised the questions of North Korea's nuclear program and missile exports in his talk with his North Korean counterpart.</p>
        <p>But he did so chiefly to alert Kim Jong Il that these issues remain  stumbling blocks, American and South Korean officials said, and he made no effort to address them in a meeting that was mostly about setting a tone of cooperation.</p>
        <p>The full briefing for American officials will come tomorrow and this weekend, when South Korea's national security adviser arrives here.</p>
        <p>So the Clinton administration today was clearly trying to balance caution with encouragement for Kim Jong Il, a man until recently regarded as an Asian Saddam Hussein.</p>
        <p>''There is a good deal of euphoria in the South,'' said one senior administration official who has been deeply involved in negotiations with the North for years. ''But is there a change in the million-man army? In the missile program? In the North's nuclear ambitions?''</p>
        <p>The only conclusion the administration could safely reach, he said this afternoon, was ''not yet.''</p>
        <p>The depth of the new opening by the North will be plumbed repeatedly in the next few months -- by South Korea, Japan and the United States. The United States has missile talks with the North that begin in a few weeks. Japan is negotiating a possible resumption of diplomatic relations -- if it can resolve the issue of Japanese women believed kidnapped by the North, and the country's continued harboring of members of the Japanese Red Army terrorist group. South Korea, once the euphoria dies down, will learn whether the exchanges of families, the communications links and the cultural exchanges -- all promised before -- turn into reality.</p>
        <p>But there is no question that with this week's summit meeting, the Clinton administration finds itself at a very different place from six years ago this week. Then, the United States was about to support sanctions against North Korea for its refusal to allow inspectors to visit the site of its suspected nuclear weapons program.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton was warned by his top military advisers that the North could make good on its threat that it would respond to the sanctions by invading the South. Mr. Clinton was about to order more troops to the region, to back up the B-2 bombers he had recently dispatched to within easy reach of the DMZ.</p>
        <p>Now, a policy of rapproachment that the administration entered reluctantly -- at the urging of South Korea's president, Kim Dae Jung,  when he came to office two years ago -- has radically changed the atmosphere. The mystery is whether it has also changed the nature of the North Korean threat.</p>
