        <p>Has Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation been left behind in the digital age?</p>
        <p>After an early and expensive Web fiasco, the company, which owns Fox television, Twentieth Century Fox, HarperCollins and a worldwide collection of other media assets, has kept a low profile on the Internet. Mr. Murdoch has publicly criticized the pending sale of Time Warner to America Online and has said that Internet companies are valued far too highly for the News Corporation to consider a similar merger.</p>
        <p>But since the AOL-Time Warner linkup, Mr. Murdoch has been working feverishly to put in place a huge media-technology deal of his own that will answer questions about his digital strategy.</p>
        <p>As soon as today, the News Corporation will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission to sell shares in a new company holding all the interests in satellite television that it has been building up over the last decade -- including the vast Star system in Asia, BSkyB in Britain, and stakes in other systems in Europe and Latin America, which collectively reach 100 million homes in 60 countries.</p>
        <p>Analysts expect the new company, which will use some variation of the Sky name, to be valued at more than $40 billion, almost as much as the parent company. With the company expected to raise perhaps $5 billion, it will be the largest media offering in history. It is certainly the sort of financial engineering that has been the hallmark of the News Corporation. But what does satellite television have to do with the Internet?</p>
        <p>Everything, in the News Corporation's view. As Internet connections become faster, people will gravitate to video content rather than just words and pictures, it assumes. More important, now that cable and satellite systems are moving to digital transmission, the channel-changing box is turning into a specialized computer that can deliver interactive information games and shopping over the television screen.</p>
        <p>''The average household spends seven hours in front of the television,'' said Peter Chernin, the president of News Corporation. ''Imagine what we can do if we change the relationship from one way to two way.'' (Mr. Murdoch, the 68-year-old chairman, declined to be interviewed, citing his treatment for prostate cancer.)</p>
        <p>The set-top box could also become the hub of a network linking other household devices from telephones to power meters, especially for homes without a computer. By creating the Sky unit and using the money from the offering to deploy those boxes rapidly around the world, the News Corporation hopes to head off other competitors.</p>
        <p>Indeed, for many homes outside the United States, that box may be the only computer in a household and could be the hub that links to other household devices, from telephones to electric meters, each of which could generate fees for the box's owner. So the News Corporation has realized that its television business can be transformed into something that is as much a technology network, if it moves fast enough. It is talking about bringing in a technology company, like Microsoft or a wireless telephone player, as a major investor in the Sky unit.</p>
        <p>''We are moving from a television world to a multimedia world in which we can create an array of content services and applications, for satellite, wireless and other platforms,'' said Chase Carey, the co-chief operating officer of the News Corporation, who will become president and chief executive of the Sky unit, based in New York.</p>
        <p>But there is another motive for the creation of Sky, one that has little to do with new technology and everything to with the panic of television programmers during the two days last month when Time Warner pulled Disney's ABC off it's cable systems.</p>
        <p>''In a world moving to five, six seven major media companies, you don't want to be in a position where you have to count on others,'' Mr. Chernin said. ''You need to have enough marketplace dominance that people are forced to deal with you.''</p>
        <p>The News Corporation itself had to enlist the help of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to get Time Warner Cable to carry the Fox News Channel in New York. While the News Corporation does not have any cable or satellite distribution of its own in the United States, it hopes that Sky's dominance of television distribution outside of the United States will give it increased bargaining power with the media companies here.</p>
        <p>But that is not to say that the News Corporation plans to keep Sky out of the United States. It has tried and failed several times to build or buy a satellite broadcasting system here. If Sky's shares are valued as high as the company hopes, analysts say it will try to use that stock to buy the EchoStar Communications Corporation or DirecTV, the most valuable asset in the Hughes Communications unit of General Motors.</p>
        <p>''By setting up a financial vehicle for its satellite assets, News Corporation will have a means of using a high-multiple currency to make acquisitions, and GM Hughes is a natural target,'' said Ed Hatch, a media analyst at SG Cowen.</p>
        <p>Indeed, there was speculation a few months ago that Mr. Murdoch was considering a bid for General Motors solely to get at DirecTV. The car business, presumably, he would jettison as an unneeded byproduct.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chernin declined to comment on the G.M. talk but he hardly disclaimed interest in DirecTV. The News Corporation, he said, has long believed that owning content like programming and distribution like satellite systems is equally important.</p>
        <p>''There are great arguments and debates about whether content is king or distribution is king,'' Mr. Chernin said. ''At the end of the day, scale is king. If you can spread your costs over a large base, you can outbid your competitors for programming and other assets you want to buy.'' (In England, this week, the News Corporation exercised the power of its scale, when BSkyB won the rights to the top soccer league, bidding $:1.1 billion.)</p>
        <p>But Mr. Chernin said Sky would have a strong business even without a satellite company here. It will have a toehold in interactive television in the United States through its 20 percent stake in the soon-to-be-merged TV Guide Gemstar. TV Guide magazine still has 10 million subscribers, but the company is now focused on producing electronic program guides used on set-top boxes to select from the hundreds of available channels.</p>
        <p>Even outside the United States, the News Corporation will face a considerable challenge tying together its holdings. The only part of the Sky empire it owns outright is Star in Asia. The rest are a collection of partnerships, but Mr. Carey insists that in most countries the News Corporation has effective management control, despite the ownership stakes of local partners.</p>
        <p>News Corporation has meanwhile been negotiating, so far unsuccessfully, to bring more partners into Sky in other regions. Jean-Marie Messier, the chief executive of Vivendi, has publicly expressed interest in linking its 49 percent of Canal Plus, Europe's largest pay television service, to Sky. But that was before he began negotiating to buy Seagram and its Universal movie and music studios. Mr. Carey said that the News Corporation is not in discussions with Vivendi.</p>
        <p>Yet what is to say that people in any country will want to shop or read information on a television screen, given the disappointing results of earlier trials?</p>
        <p>The News Corporation has been emboldened by the experience of BSkyB, which made a pre-emptive move to convert its system from analog to digital signals, starting in 1998. By giving away set-top boxes worth $200, the company converted 3.4 million of its 4.2 million subscribers to the digital system.</p>
        <p>In addition to more channels, BSkyB offers an interactive television service called Open, with the usual crop of information pages on news, weather and sports. But use has been far higher than for other such services. Half of the customers use it at least once a week.</p>
        <p>News Corporation is hardly alone in betting on the future of media convergence. America Online is about to introduce its own AOL TV set-top box. Microsoft has spruced up its WebTV product. In Europe, moreover, companies are lining up to pay as much as $5 billion for licenses to offer the next generation of wireless telephone service called 3G, which is also capable of delivering high-speed data services.</p>
        <p>The News Corporation has not bid for wireless licenses. But it figures that Sky's position straddling media and technology will let it cut deals to merge wireless services with its Sky offerings. ''A lot of companies just bid a lot of money for 3G licenses so they can compete with four other companies that offer the same thing,'' Mr. Carey said. ''They are going to need to differentiate their cell phone services and clearly we can bring our brands, our content and the services we are developing.''</p>
