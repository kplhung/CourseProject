        <p>Armed with a flood of tips that followed the release of suspects' photographs, the police yesterday arrested six young men, from all around the region and all walks of life, and charged them in the rampage of sexual assaults Sunday in Central Park.</p>
        <p>One of the suspects, a barber from Queens, described getting into ''an innocent water fight that got out of hand.''

        <p>Armed with a flood of tips that followed the release of suspects' photographs, the police yesterday arrested six young men, from all around the region and all walks of life, and charged them in the rampage of sexual assaults Sunday in Central Park.</p>
        <p>One of the suspects, a barber from Queens, described getting into ''an innocent water fight that got out of hand.'' Another, a minister's son,  planned to go to college and hoped to become a lawyer. A third, a high school student, told his mother that he was actually trying to help a women being attacked. And a fourth, a father of two boys from Jersey City, was described by friends as a good parent.</p>
        <p>The Police Department, buoyed by its sudden success in making arrests,  yesterday released photographs of 13 more suspects taken from videotapes of the melee, and said that as many as 20 people were still being sought in attacks on as many as 37 women. In addition to yesterday's six arrests, two people were arrested immediately after the incident.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's arrests began at 5:30 a.m. and continued throughout the day and into the night. For the police, it was a frenetic day: the victims of the attacks filed through the Manhattan South Homicide Squad's offices on East 21st Street to watch videotapes of the attack, and at one point, with more than a dozen women waiting to watch the videos, the police ordered four more VCR's and monitors.</p>
        <p>The men arrested yesterday, who ranged in age from 16 to 31, were all charged with first-degree sexual abuse, a felony, and may face additional charges, said Deputy Chief William Taylor, who is overseeing the investigation. Most had no arrest records or arrests for minor crimes, he said.</p>
        <p>Arrested first yesterday was John Taylor, 24, of 141 Beach 56th Street,  who was picked up at his mother's  home in Queens about 5:30 a.m. Steven Burt, 31, of Jersey City, surrendered to the authorities there. Isaias Lozano, 20, of 117-12 Jamaica Avenue, and Manuel Nunez, 18, were arrested in the morning, and 16-year-old Roberto Camacho of Inwood, Long Island, surrendered later in the day.</p>
        <p>Manuel Vargas, 18, of 1174 Sheridan Avenue in the Bronx, the man the police described as the ''main player'' or ''instigator,'' surrendered last night, telephoning a detective sergeant at a number listed on one of the many business cards that investigators had distributed throughout his Bronx neighborhood, an official said. ''He is identified by at least five or six of the women,'' a senior investigator said.</p>
        <p>Police who had earlier searched his family's home seized a shirt they said he wore during the attacks.</p>
        <p>In addition to the complaints of  assault and sexual abuse, nine women said that they had been robbed, officials said.</p>
        <p>Maria Nunez wept yesterday as she described how the police came for her son, Manuel, who has a year left at Taft High School. He had not mentioned the parade until a friend spotted his photo in the paper yesterday, she said.</p>
        <p>Another parent shared her shock.  ''I was surprised and it hit me hard,  because I know he's innocent,'' said Isaias Lozano, Mr. Lozano's father, a minister. ''He was at the parade in the wrong place at the wrong time.''</p>
        <p>Some in Jersey City recalled Mr. Burt as a conscientious father of two boys and companion to their mother, Genise Shuler, until the couple broke up six years ago. ''He was a nice guy who worked and took care of his family,'' Ms. Shuler said. ''He was always by himself and not with a crowd.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Camacho, who climbed out a window in the back of his house in Inwood while his mother spoke to the police Wednesday, surrendered yesterday after people in his Long Island community identified him.</p>
        <p>As more than 75 detectives concentrated on identifying suspects and making arrests in the attacks, Internal Affairs detectives looked into  complaints that police officers had failed to respond to reports of the assaults. The detectives questioned nearly 100 police supervisors and prepared to begin questioning officers today.</p>
        <p>Senior police officials also began investigating how the southeast corner of the park and parts of adjoining Central Park South had been left with little police presence, despite the deployment of 4,000 officers at the parade.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of officers were dismissed starting at 5 p.m.; officials wanted to determine whether commanders had coordinated staffing so that the southern part of the parade route would retain some police coverage, an official said.</p>
        <p>Although some of the officers who were allowed to go home had been patrolling Central Park South, officials have said that none were assigned to cover the section of the park where the majority of the attacks occurred. If the officers had been in the general area, they might have spotted people moving toward the site of the melee, officials said.  But one official cautioned that on a very crowded day, as the parade ended and thousands of people began to head home, it may not have been easy to discern that a large group had begun to descend on a particular area.</p>
        <p>''If you see a roving band,'' the supervisor said, ''you are supposed to put it out over the radio, but what if everything is so crowded that all you see is a crowd moving down the street?''</p>
        <p>At a news conference on the arrests, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani defended the conduct of the majority of the police officers who patrolled the parade, but acknowledged that some may have failed to respond properly to reports of the attacks. He said complaints against them would be vigorously investigated.</p>
        <p>He also stressed that the responsibility lay with the unruly men who had committed the crimes.</p>
        <p>''Whether the response was excellent in some cases, wanting in others, that's a response. The actual physical attack was conducted by these -- could be 30, 40, 50, could be as many as 60 males -- and they're the ones who bear the ultimate responsibility for it.''</p>
        <p>The mayor said he had talked to six victims of the assaults. Four, he said, praised the police reaction, and two were critical.</p>
        <p>A senior police official said that investigators had begun to focus on a handful of officers, who, he said, may have failed to respond properly to complaints about roving bands in the sweltering park, where groups of disorderly men formed gantlets, splashing water on women, tearing at their clothes and groping them. But the official said he did not see the officers' conduct as egregious.</p>
        <p>Last night, Gov. George E. Pataki said he would propose legislation to designate gang sexual assault as a separate crime, said Caroline Quartararo, a spokeswoman for Mr. Pataki. The crime would be a class D felony with a maximum prison sentence of seven years, a far more serious crime than simple sexual assault, a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail, she said.</p>
        <p>Chief Taylor yesterday credited the pictures and more than 50 calls to the police Crime Stoppers telephone line -- encouraged by the $2,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and an additional $10,000 reward at conviction -- with yesterday's successes.</p>
