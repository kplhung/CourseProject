        <p>In discussions of popular culture nowadays, few words are more crassly degraded than reality, as in the ''reality programming'' that is a hot new television trend. The misapplication of the word to categorize gimmicky televised pseudo-events is all the more distressing when such sensationalist fluff is compared with the best documentary and fiction films to be seen each year at the Human Rights Watch Film Festival. This reality is the genuine article.</p>
        <p>The vital annual series, which opened on Wednesday at the Walter Reade Theater with Randa Chahal Sabbag's documentary about Lebanon, ''A Civilized People,'' is probably the best New York showcase for films exploring political, social and economic issues that cannot be neatly summarized in 15-minute segments. And in a gossip- and celebrity-saturated media climate that increasingly ignores the world beyond our borders, the festival offers intimate, often painful glimpses into other cultures that no other information source could provide.</p>

        <p>In discussions of popular culture nowadays, few words are more crassly degraded than reality, as in the ''reality programming'' that is a hot new television trend. The misapplication of the word to categorize gimmicky televised pseudo-events is all the more distressing when such sensationalist fluff is compared with the best documentary and fiction films to be seen each year at the Human Rights Watch Film Festival. This reality is the genuine article.</p>
        <p>The vital annual series, which opened on Wednesday at the Walter Reade Theater with Randa Chahal Sabbag's documentary about Lebanon, ''A Civilized People,'' is probably the best New York showcase for films exploring political, social and economic issues that cannot be neatly summarized in 15-minute segments. And in a gossip- and celebrity-saturated media climate that increasingly ignores the world beyond our borders, the festival offers intimate, often painful glimpses into other cultures that no other information source could provide.</p>
        <p>Human rights issues, of course, concern the United States as well as the rest of the world. One of the most powerful films to be shown in the festival, Laurie Collyer's documentary ''Nuyorican Dream'' (next Friday at 6:15 p.m. and June 26 at 8:30 p.m.), is set mostly within the city limits of New York. Seven years in the making, this astoundingly intimate film is a close-up, at-home portrait of a troubled Puerto Rican family in the Bronx. Their troubles are viewed through the compassionate and loving eyes of Robert Torres, the only family member to have graduated from college.</p>
        <p>Mr. Torres, a 30-year-old New York City schoolteacher, is the eldest son of Marta Gutierrez, a courageous mother to whom falls the almost impossible task of holding together three generations of her family with few resources. Throughout the movie, Mr. Torres offers pointed observations about how a legacy of colonialism, an inadequate inner-city educational system and ingrained prejudice that keeps Puerto Ricans out of fast-track classes and diminishes their already low self-esteem combine to perpetuate a cycle of poverty, drugs and hopelessness.</p>
        <p>In addition to the mother and son, we meet two of Mr. Torres's sisters, who are battling drug addiction, and a younger brother who is in prison. What gives the film an extra edge is that Mr. Torres, who is gay, is clearly alienated from his loved ones by his middle-class status. The dual perspective he offers, of someone who belongs to the family yet sees beyond its insular world, lends the film a wrenching authenticity. As much knowledge and wisdom as Mr. Torres has gained, he is essentially powerless against the social forces that have oppressed his family and thousands like them. ''Nuyorican Dream'' strikes an even deeper emotional chord than ''An American Love Story,'' the much-publicized multipart documentary about an interracial marriage that was shown last year on PBS.</p>
        <p>A perfect example of an international story that could be done justice only by a documentary film is Kevin McKiernan's video movie ''Good Kurds, Bad Kurds: No Friends but the Mountains'' (June 24 at 1 p.m., June 28 at 6 p.m. and June 29 at 1 p.m.). The film is, among many other things, a concise history of a people Mr. McKiernan calls ''the Native Americans of Asia Minor.''</p>
        <p>The ''good Kurds'' in the eyes of the United States are those who live in Iraq and are persecuted by Saddam Hussein. The ''bad'' are those fighting a guerrilla war against the government in Turkey (an American ally), where they make up 20 percent of the population. The movie delves deep into the history and politics of Kurdistan region while analyzing the seemingly contradictory policy of the United States and criticizing Turkey for human rights violations.</p>
        <p>Also notable on the international front are Marco Bechlis's ''Garage Olimpo'' (next Friday at 9:15 p.m., June 25 at 8:45 p.m. and June 26 at 3:15 p.m.) a not-for-the-squeamish film from Argentina about an opponent of the military dictatorship who is tortured in a garage in the heart of Buenos Aires, and ''Pathos'' (tomorrow at 6:30 p.m., Sunday at 8:15 p.m. and Monday at 3:45 p.m.), a drama by the Indian director Jayaraaj about aging parents whose grown children sell the family plantation out from under them and blithely ship them off to an old-age home. The touching Lebanese video documentary ''Children of Shatila,'' directed by Mai Masri, looks at the impoverished lives of two Palestinian children, 11 and 13, growing up in a refugee camp in Lebanon (June 26 at 6 p.m., June 28 at 8:45 p.m. and June 29 at 3:30 p.m.).</p>
        <p>A high point of the festival is a rare showing (tonight at 9:15 and tomorrow night at 9) of Martin Ritt's black-and-white drama ''Edge of the City,'' a movie so atmospherically gritty it has dirt under its fingernails. Released in 1957, three years after ''On the Waterfront'' (an obvious prototype), ''Edge of the City'' is a portrait of an interracial friendship and social prejudice on the job. John Cassavetes plays Axel, a drifter with a guilty secret, and Sidney Poitier is his best friend, Tommy, a cocky, free-spirited fellow porter at the West Side Terminal. Jack Warden is their corrupt, bullying boss. As Tommy, Mr. Poitier is nothing less than incandescent, effusing a volatile mixture of devil-may-care humor and infectious joie de vivre.</p>
        <p>The Human Rights Watch Film Festival continues through June 29 at the Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center. Admission: $9; members, $5; senior citizens, $4.50 at weekday matinees. Information and screening times: (212) 875-5600 or www.filmlinc.com.</p>
