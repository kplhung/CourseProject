        <p>From farmers tilling rice paddies to workers walking through high-rise office buildings, South Koreans were both elated and relieved -- and a bit wary -- today as their president brought back promises of peace and reconciliation from North Korea.</p>
        <p>''This week, I saw things happen that I never imagined would take place,'' said Kim Bok Young, 50, who runs a clothing company in Seoul. ''In our hearts, I think we have already achieved reunification.''</p>
        <p>Echoing that sentiment was Jang Young Joo, a 47-year-old government worker who was holding a South Korean flag in a crowd of hundreds at City Hall trying to catch a glimpse of President Kim Dae Jung's motorcade. ''So much of the negative feelings are gone, and now I want reunification as soon as possible,'' he said. ''We're brothers and sisters.''</p>
        <p>For the younger generation of South Koreans, recent images of North Koreans broadcast across the nation were enough to dispel stereotypes ingrained since childhood.</p>
        <p>''When I was young, I was taught that North Koreans were strange,'' said Kim Jung Joon, a 22-year-old medical student, as he sat in a Starbucks coffee shop in Seoul. ''But after seeing them on TV, they weren't as weird as I thought.''</p>
        <p>But for a nation with old memories of the Korean War and fresh scars of a devastating economic crisis, the prospect of ties with North Korea seemed both daunting and scary.</p>
        <p>Pulling out weeds from her rice paddy in Pyongtaek, a city some 40 miles south of Seoul, Kim Ok Su, 75, let out a deep breath when asked how she felt about the possibility of reunification with North Korea.</p>
        <p>''I don't know much, but I think there will be many difficulties after reunification, and lots of money we'd have to spend,'' Ms. Kim said shyly. ''My youngest boy lost his job after the I.M.F.,'' she added, alluding to the economic crisis that broke out in late 1997, causing South Korea to turn to the International Monetary Fund for emergency loans. ''He still hasn't found a job.''</p>
        <p>The discussion about North Korea led Ms. Kim to reminisce about the Korean War, which started 50 years ago. The memories may be hazy, but they are bitter.</p>
        <p>''The Commies came to our village with guns and took our food and wouldn't even let us leave our lights on at night,'' she said. ''They killed a lot of people here. Just thinking about Commies makes me shudder.''</p>
