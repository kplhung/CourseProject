        <p>Here is a selective listing of new or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show.</p>
        <p>BARBARA CARROLL, Bemelmans Bar, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212) 744-1600. This agelessly chic red-haired pianist and singer seems to know every important popular song ever written and to be able to perform from memory in any key. Her elegant, lyrical pianism is a compendium of 20th-century jazz styles, from Count Basie to Erroll Garner to Bill Evans and beyond. And her clipped, understated vocals, which verge on speech-song, approach lyrics from a wry but warmhearted point of view. Through July 22. Tuesday through Saturday nights, beginning at 9:30. From 5:30 to 8, Michael Devine. No cover for early show; cover for late show: $15. No minimum; $5 cover at the bar.</p>

        <p>BARBARA CARROLL, Bemelmans Bar, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212) 744-1600.

From 5:30 to 8, Michael Devine. No cover for early show; cover for late show: $15. No minimum; $5 cover at the bar.</p>
        <p>* HOWARD FISHMAN QUARTET, Sardi's, 234 West 44th Street, (212) 221-8440. Powerful echoes of Stephane Grappelli and Bix Beiderbecke are among the influences rippling through the Howard Fishman Quartet's seamless swing. The group -- Mr. Fishman on guitar, banjo and vocals; Russell Farhang playing virtuosic Grappelli-style violin; Peter Ecklund on cornet; Andrew Hall on bass -- folds elements of vintage jazz, swing and early bluegrass into rhythmically animated, richly allusive jazz chamber music. Whether the music is Stephen Foster (a bubbly ''Old Folks at Home''), Gershwin (''Soon'') or Romberg (''When I Grow Too Old to Dream''), it is all translated into lilting, fine-tuned ensemble music that transcends time and idiom. Fridays at 10:30 p.m. No cover charge, but $15 minimum at tables.</p>
        <p>* ''OUR SINATRA,'' Blue Angel Theater, 323 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. The rising young cabaret star Eric Comstock is the mastermind behind this utterly winning tribute to Ol' Blue Eyes, which focuses on what Mr. Comstock calls the hidden gems and orphan songs that Sinatra made popular. Joined by Christopher Gines, a creamy baritone who echoes Dick Haymes and Steve Lawrence in their prime, and Hilary Kole, a perky swinger, Mr. Comstock conducts a witty and knowledgeable survey of the Sinatra canon. Mr. Comstock focuses on the mature Sinatra and Mr. Gines on the dreamy 1940's balladeer, with Ms. Kole bridging the gap. The memorable show proves there are still young singers good enough to keep the tradition alive. Today, tomorrow, Monday and Thursday nights at 8; Sunday at 3 and 7:30 p.m.; Wednesday at 2:30 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $50 and $55 (premium ringside seating, $75 and $80).</p>
        <p>FIREBIRD CAFE, 363 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 586-0244. Tonight at 9 and 11, Sian Phillips. Cover: $30; $15 minimum. Tomorrow night at 9 and 11, Kane Alexander. Cover: $25; $15 minimum. Sunday night at 7, Julie Gold, singer-songwriter (part of Firebird Songwriters series); at 9, Jack Donahue, singer. Cover: $20; $15 minimum.</p>
        <p>* BOBBY SHORT, Cafe Carlyle, at the Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212) 744-1600. Although his voice has its ups and downs, Mr. Short, now 75, still gives the best cabaret party in New York. For his 32nd spring season at the Cafe Carlyle, he is joined by a small, top-notch swing band, and he struts his bluesier pianism in the instrumental ''Moten Swing.'' Nobody puts a more vivacious spin on Cole Porter than Mr. Short, whose new show includes a boyishly wistful version of ''Why Shouldn't I?'' and the hilariously tongue-twisting, double-entendre-laden title song from ''Can-Can.'' Tuesday through Saturday nights at 8:45 and 10:45. Through June 24. Cover: $60 at tables, no minimum; $30 cover at the bar.</p>
        <p>FEINSTEIN'S, at the Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212) 339-4095. Vikki Carr.
