        <p>In yet another reshuffling of his presidential campaign, Vice President Al Gore announced today that William M. Daley, the secretary of commerce and a shrewd operative in Democratic politics, would replace the campaign chairman, Tony Coelho.</p>
        <p>Mr. Coelho, who has been in a hospital since Monday night with an inflamed colon, said he had decided to step down on the advice of his doctors, who urged him to restrict his travel and slow his pace.

        <p>In yet another reshuffling of his presidential campaign, Vice President Al Gore announced today that William M. Daley, the secretary of commerce and a shrewd operative in Democratic politics, would replace the campaign chairman, Tony Coelho.</p>
        <p>Mr. Coelho, who has been in a hospital since Monday night with an inflamed colon, said he had decided to step down on the advice of his doctors, who urged him to restrict his travel and slow his pace. But many Democrats said the move had been inevitable, given the way Mr. Gore's campaign has struggled in recent months.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daley flew from Washington to Lockland, Ohio, a Cincinnati suburb, to join Mr. Gore at a scheduled campaign event this afternoon as Gore advisers sought to project a sense of optimism, despite the upheaval to the campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daley is to visit the Gore headquarters in Nashville next week and will relocate there to become what Mr. Gore called a ''full-time, hands-on'' manager. He will leave his cabinet post on July 15.</p>
        <p>Coming less than five months before Election Day, the change seems unlikely to bring any immediate strategic or visible changes to the campaign. Even so, Mr. Daley is taking over at a time when important decisions will have to be made about a running mate, the national convention and where to pump the campaign's resources.</p>
        <p>''We're not going to miss a beat,'' Mr. Gore told reporters as he announced Mr. Daley's appointment, the secretary at his side. For his part, Mr. Daley said of the campaign, ''I don't see any problems whatsoever.'' [Man in the News, Page A27.]</p>
        <p>While Democrats hoped that the shift in chairmen would energize the campaign, it created another unwelcome distraction for Mr. Gore, largely overshadowing his recent efforts to capitalize on the prosperity of the Clinton years and offer new proposals for taking advantage of the growing budget surplus. Today, in fact, Mr. Gore doubled the size of his proposed tax cut, to $500 billion over the next decade. [Page A27.]</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's campaign has been largely on the defensive since the primary season, and his opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has begun pulling ahead in many surveys, including those in states expected to be pivotal in November.</p>
        <p>But what is most troubling to Democrats is a sense among strategists in both parties that Mr. Bush has been far more successful in making the transition to the general election campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daley has never run a national campaign. But he is known as a skilled manager and is highly regarded in Democratic circles, as well as in the business community. In 1992, he helped the Clinton campaign navigate the politics of the Midwest, the crucial battleground for the coming general election. He is a son of the late Mayor Richard J. Daley, who dominated Chicago politics for two decades, and the brother of current Mayor Richard M. Daley.</p>
        <p>While the overhaul was prompted by Mr. Coelho's health, several Gore campaign officials said that in recent weeks the vice president had recognized that he needed to make changes in his campaign, which seemed to drift after Mr. Gore clinched the Democratic nomination nearly three months ago.</p>
        <p>Two people close to the campaign also said that Mr. Gore's wife, Tipper, had expressed concerns about Mr. Coelho's health for the past month or more, wondering whether he was up to the job.</p>
        <p>Campaigns, generally, are not won or lost by campaign chairmen. But Mr. Coelho's departure is significant because it reflects how even after years of preparation, the vice president still has had trouble assembling a stable inner circle to run his organization.</p>
        <p>In contrast, Mr. Bush has maintained the same tight circle of aides since announcing his candidacy, and those aides seemed to take delight in the Gore campaign's woes.</p>
        <p>''I wonder whether naming a new chairman involves yet another reinvention of the Gore campaign,'' said Karen P. Hughes, Mr. Bush's communications director.</p>
        <p>Today's move also underscored a belief among Democrats that Mr. Gore needs to move quickly to energize his campaign as it prepares for the Democratic National Convention in August, when the vast majority of voters traditionally begin to pay close attention to the election.</p>
        <p>''This transition better be seamless and it better be fast, because there is no time to lose,'' said Senator Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey. ''George Bush is well-funded and well organized, and clearly has developed a sense of momentum.''</p>
        <p>The real problems of the Gore campaign, of course, may come down to more than just one man.</p>
        <p>''If anyone understands that you live or die by the sword it is Coelho,'' said Representative Luis V. Gutierrez, Democrat of Chicago. ''He's a consummate politician. I'm sure he left for two reasons: He's genuinely sick and he understands there are genuine problems with the campaign.''</p>
        <p>People close to Mr. Coelho and Mr. Gore said that the two had never worked well together, and that the vice president was increasingly bypassing him and turning to other advisers like Carter Eskew.</p>
        <p>''Tony and Al Gore never really liked each other,'' said a top Democratic official who knows Mr. Coelho well. ''There's little mutual respect and no affection. They're very different people.''</p>
        <p>When Mr. Coelho came to the campaign a year ago, he was former House majority whip, known for his aggressive fund-raising prowess. He had served in Congress from 1978 to 1989, representing part of California's Central Valley. He resigned 11 years ago today after questions were raised about whether he had profited from a junk bond in what looked like a sweetheart deal.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Gore named Mr. Coelho as his campaign chairman in May 1999, the campaign was beset by overspending, and many Democrats credit Mr. Coehlo with cutting costs and steering through a treacherous series of primary contests.</p>
        <p>But other one-time allies said that his controlling personality had led Mr. Coelho to reach into virtually every aspect of the campaign, and that an abrasive manner had alienated many of those with whom he worked, including Donna Brazile, the campaign manager.</p>
        <p>Moreover, they said, federal investigations into his past financial activities had created even more problems. For example, one Gore ally said, Mr. Coelho could not be an effective spokesman for the vice president because he declined to appear on television, largely out of concern that he might be questioned about the federal investigations.</p>
        <p>While most of his problems were internal to the campaign, Mr. Coelho also took the blame for one of Mr. Gore's biggest political fiascos: his call for Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban boy, to be given permanent residence in the United States, a position that put him at odds with President Clinton and others in the administration.</p>
        <p>In a recent interview, Mr. Coelho acknowledged there had been mistakes, particularly that the campaign had allowed Mr. Gore to become enmeshed in the Gonzalez case. But Mr. Coelho also said that he had brought discipline and order to the campaign -- and that he had stepped in so the vice president did not have to make all the decisions.</p>
        <p>Asked if, before he took over, Mr. Gore was a micromanager in the mold of President Jimmy Carter, Mr. Coelho said: ''I think he probably was. People said he did. But since I've been on board he doesn't.''</p>
        <p>Many inside and outside the campaign perceived the illness as a convenient cover for Mr. Gore to ease Mr. Coelho to the sidelines after a somewhat tumultuous yearlong reign.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Coelho, who turned 58 today, said the move came strictly for health reasons.</p>
        <p>''The call I made to the vice president last night informing him of my doctor's advice is one of the most difficult calls I have ever had to make,'' he said in a statement released by Gore headquarters in Nashville. ''My doctors have told me that I need to slow down, eat better and travel less for a period of time. Unfortunately, none of this advice is consistent with the rigors of chairing a presidential campaign.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Coelho has long had epilepsy, and two people close to him said he  had suffered several seizures recently.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daley had been under consideration as a running mate for Mr. Gore. But Mr. Gore said in an interview tonight that he had removed Mr. Daley from consideration because ''it is not possible to be a full-time hands-on campaign manager all the way through the election and also be a vice-presidential running mate.''</p>
        <p>The vice president has such confidence in Mr. Daley that he had offered him the post in the first place, before turning to Mr. Coelho. Mr. Daley, who has been commerce secretary since January 1997, resisted the entreaties, saying he had not been in office long enough.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said today that Mr. Daley sprang to mind last night immediately after he spoke with Mr. Coelho. Mr. Coelho had called Mr. Gore, who was attending a fund-raising dinner on the Upper East Side last night, about 11 o'clock. Mr. Gore said he called Mr. Daley in Washington after midnight, waking him up. Mr. Gore and Mr. Daley said neither of them had notified President Clinton until today.</p>
        <p>''I took his commerce secretary away before I told him,'' Mr. Gore said, adding that he called the president this morning.</p>
