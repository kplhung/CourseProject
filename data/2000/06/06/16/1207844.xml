        <p>Chuck Knoblauch was infected with throwing jitters two years ago and, for two years, he instinctively played through them, always coming back in spite of all the attention they attracted.</p>
        <p>His throwing mechanics were described in detail and analyzed in super slow motion last fall: see how his feet don't move, the voices said, see how terrible he is. Little Leaguers yelled at him, their coaches offered suggestions. But Knoblauch persevered, batting .313 with a pivotal home run in the third game of the World Series. Somehow, he managed to box those throwing failures and set them aside in some remote corner of his mind, and continue to be a highly effective player.</p>
        <p>Luis Sojo, one of his teammates, remarked in March how tough Knoblauch must be to withstand the pressures of his problem. ''Anybody else would've taken his bats and gone home,'' Sojo said.</p>
        <p>Last night, however, all parts of Knoblauch -- the fielder, the hitter, the person -- were affected by his throwing neurosis. Last night, he finally had enough, calling his manager after his third throwing error in four innings and telling him how badly he was hurting the team. Joe Torre told Knoblauch not to say anything more and suggested he go home immediately, rather than wait and expose all of his feelings to reporters. It was a prudent decision by Torre, who probably remembered how Knoblauch suggested to reporters last month, after a particularly poor throw, that he might quit.</p>
        <p>But Knoblauch needs to follow the instinct that has always guided him and get back on the field -- immediately. Tonight. He needs to run out to second base before the first inning, take a few practice grounders from first baseman Tino Martinez, and he needs to hope that the very first ball is hit to him, so he can move on.</p>
        <p>If he doesn't do this, the problem will fester, the attention it draws will grow. If he goes out tonight and makes a few plays, good or bad, he will at least be moving forward. But the longer Knoblauch stays out of the lineup, stays away from the field, the more attention will be focused on his throwing, and on the reaction from the fans, and on and on.</p>
        <p>His teammates long ago accepted the fact that Knoblauch is going to make throwing errors. Martinez does not jog to first base when a ball is hit to Knoblauch. He moves quickly to the bag, spreads his feet wide and prepares for anything, a throw in any direction, low or high or to his right or left. No one complains, no one gripes, no one rolls his eyes. They all understand they are a better team with Knoblauch.</p>
        <p>Imagine the Yankees without Knoblauch. They would have no true leadoff hitter, no one to jump-start the offense, no one who reaches base so consistently, forces the opposing first baseman to stay anchored to first and keep the hole open for Derek Jeter to shoot for. Knoblauch scored 117 runs in 1998 and batted .375 in the World Series against the Padres. Last year, he scored 120 runs before hitting .333 in the American League Championship Series and starring in the World Series.</p>
        <p>''He's a package for me, and the offensive side, coupled with the defensive side, we definitely come out with the plus,'' Torre said last night. ''How can you say anything other than it's a plus? We've won two World Series in two years, and he's been our second baseman.</p>
        <p>''But again, when you're going through a tough time, like he is right now, you have a tendency to magnify the bad stuff and not really take the good stuff into consideration.''</p>
        <p>Said Martinez: ''He feels he's hurting the team by making errors, and he's not. Everybody makes errors, and I don't think he realizes how many key hits he gets, how many big runs he drives in in clutch situations, and not a whole lot of guys can do that.</p>
        <p>''He makes our offense go. With him and Jeter at the top, they get us going.''</p>
        <p>The Yankee players could have easily slipped out the side doors to the clubhouse to avoid reporters last night. But most lingered, and it was clear they wanted to support Knoblauch. ''Everybody on the team feels for him,'' said Scott Brosius, the third baseman. ''He's frustrated because he wants to win, and he wants to play well.''</p>
        <p>Knoblauch said one night last month that he needed to solve his problem or quit, but the next day, he was more circumspect, joking at his own expense. He assured reporters that he would not walk away this season. ''That's quitting; I'm not into quitting,'' he said. ''If I was really whacked, I'd be in the Caymans right now, or Martha's Vineyard.''</p>
        <p>He might feel like going to the Caymans today. But he needs to be at Yankee Stadium, at second base, for the sake of the Yankees, and himself.</p>
