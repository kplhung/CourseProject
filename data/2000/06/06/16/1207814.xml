        <p>Gone are the long way wavy locks. Gone is the familiar headband.</p>
        <p>''I'm getting older now,'' Bjorn Borg said.</p>
        <p>He is 44 now, the father of a teenager. His hair is sandy gray and layered smartly short, and he is on the verge of retiring. Again. After eight years, Borg has decided this will be his final one on the senior men's professional tennis circuit.</p>
        <p>''For me, it's enough,'' Borg said. ''I'm still going to be involved. I'm just not going to travel as much.''</p>
        <p>The LastMinuteTravel.com Masters championship, being held on Central Park's Wollman Rink, marks Borg's last professional event in the United States. Even though he lost to Andres Gomez, 6-3, 6-4, yesterday in his first match of the round-robin tournament, Borg said he was not disheartened.</p>
        <p>''There's not any pressure,'' Borg said. ''You just go out and play. If youlose, it's not the end of the world.''</p>
        <p>Twenty years ago this summer, Borg won his fifth straight Wimbledon title, a record, with a five-set victory over John McEnroe that is still a classic.</p>
        <p>The two do not discuss those points anymore, even though they regularly re-enact their rivalry on the seniors tour.</p>
        <p>''When they started this tour, I realized that Imissed my friends, my generation, all these guys,'' Borg said.</p>
        <p>Borg owns 11 Grand Slam singles titles, as opposed to Connors's eight or McEnroe's seven, but he receives third billing.</p>
        <p>''For me, that's never been the important issue,'' he said.</p>
        <p>What is important to Borg now rests mainly in Sweden, which is the reason he is retiring from competitive tennis for the third time. Until the end of the year, he will still play senior tournaments in Europe and then will help develop 10 junior players back in Sweden through a five-year program he created.</p>
        <p>Besides running his clothing company out of Stockholm, he is looking forward to spending more time with his 14-year-old son, Robin, who also plays tennis. Borg does not coach him, nor pressure him.</p>
        <p>Borg played ice hockey until he was 17 in Sweden, but a year later he won the first of his six French Opens. On this senior tour, he has won only five tournaments and did not qualify for this season-ending event until April, as the eighth and last seeded player. Connors, who is scheduled to play Borg today, is worried that the Swede's departure will have an impact on the tour.</p>
        <p>''He was so good for the tour when he wanted to come back and play and be a part of it from the beginning, especially when a lot of guys were shooting it down,'' said Connors, who founded the tour in 1993. ''It's going to be tough on the tour and I hate to see that.''</p>
        <p>''I missed him when he walked away the first time,'' said Connors, who defeated Mats Wilander, 6-1, 6-2, yesterday, but had to see a doctor afterward because of a neck problem.</p>
        <p>Borg first retired from the ATP Tour in 1983, when he was 27, and came back for eight single events in 1991 before he joined the senior circuit in 1993.</p>
        <p>Wilander grew up admiring his nation's hero and his colleagues are now looking to him to replace him.</p>
        <p>''In some ways, he will be the person most expected to step in certain ways for Borg, which obviously can't be done, but to some degree,'' McEnroe said of Wilander. McEnroe is 1-1 in the round robin after losing to Mikael Pernfors, 3-6, 6-3, 10-5.</p>
        <p>Also, Henri Leconte stopped Mansour Bahrami, 7-6 (6), 3-6, 10-8.</p>
        <p>Wilander, 35, has been on the senior tour three years. Tonight he will play his idol in the match rescheduled from Wednesday.</p>
        <p>After having once lost to Borg, 6-1, 6-1, when he was 16, Wilander went on to win seven Grand Slams. Only since joining the senior tour has he become close friends with Borg, though.</p>
        <p>''We all looked up to him,'' Wilander said. ''I think he is still the nicest guy in the world.''</p>
