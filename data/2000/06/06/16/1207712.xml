        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Brat Control on Easy Street'' (news article, June 12):</p>
        <p>I offer this advice for parents with young children: Start them immediately on the ''jar system,'' an idea first introduced in the early 1990's by Neale S. Godfrey, the kids-and-money guru.</p>
        <p>Each week, children work around the house to earn an allowance that is then divided into different jars.</p>
        <p>In our home, those jars are for College, Charity, Saving for Fun Stuff, Quick Cash (pocket money) and Tax.</p>
        <p>Our son is 9 and has been using the jars for five years. He has made several small but well-considered charitable contributions to various organizations, and has bought toys that he saved many weeks or months to buy.</p>
        <p>We still buy him birthday and Christmas presents and, yes, even the occasional gift for no reason. But there is nothing like seeing one's child buy a $50 Pokemon Nintendo game with $1 bills and coins that he earned and saved, and sharing the sense of accomplishment he feels.</p>
