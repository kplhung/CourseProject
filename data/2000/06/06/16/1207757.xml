      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Stung by criticism of his record-breaking spending in the Senate primary, Jon S. Corzine has laid off most of his campaign workers and dropped several consultants.</p>
        <p>The changes, coupled with a reshuffling of Mr. Corzine's top aides, suggest that Senator Robert G. Torricelli will enjoy a greater degree of influence over the Corzine campaign.</p>
        <p>Altogether, 51 workers were let go after the primary with one week's notice, leaving just 17 full-time employees. The layoffs will reduce the campaign's twice-monthly staff payroll to $82,000 from $550,000, said Christy E. Davis, a co-manager of the campaign.</p>
        <p>In addition, two top officials have switched roles and another has departed. Steven Goldstein, who was paid $20,000 a month as a co-campaign manager and Mr. Corzine's chief spokesman during the primary, has relinquished his full-time job to start a public relations business, Attention America. He will remain heavily involved in the Senate campaign, but as a consultant, under terms which were not disclosed.</p>
        <p>Steve DeMicco, a principal in the New Brunswick consulting firm Message and Media, will join the campaign full time, replacing Mr. Goldstein. He will share the title of co-campaign manager with Ms. Davis, but two Democratic officials close to the campaign said Mr. DeMicco would play a more senior role, an assertion Ms. Davis disputed.</p>
        <p>Mr. DeMicco's firm received a $50,000-a-month retainer during the primary campaign for its work, mainly on direct mailings to Democratic voters. It is unclear whether Message and Media will continue to work directly for Mr. Corzine or shift over to the coordinated fall campaign on behalf of all the Democratic Party's candidates in federal races in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>It is also not known whether Mr. Corzine will directly or indirectly finance the coordinated campaign, with regulated contributions or unlimited soft-money contributions.</p>
        <p>Mr. DeMicco is a close associate of Senator Torricelli, the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, who has closely followed Mr. Corzine's campaign. Both Ms. Davis and Mr. Goldstein had worked previously for Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, with whom Mr. Torricelli has long feuded.</p>
        <p>Patty McGuire-Nelson, who received $18,000 a month during the primary campaign as Mr. Corzine's political director, left voluntarily, aides to Mr. Corzine said.</p>
        <p>Of the 51 campaign workers who have left the campaign, 12 were field workers whose jobs ended with the June 6 primary; some of them may also wind up working for the Democratic coordinated campaign in the fall.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goldstein conceded that Mr. Corzine saw a need to react to reports and editorials that were critical of the campaign's spending in the primary, which approached $35 million, more than four times the previous record.</p>
        <p>''Jon intends to run a more leanly staffed operation in the general election for two reasons,'' Mr. Goldstein said. ''One is a more practical one: He no longer needs as big a staff or expenditure of resources now that he has name recognition. And two, he wants to send a clear signal of fiscal responsibility.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine left on Wednesday for a 10-day vacation in the Turks and Caicos Islands of the Caribbean, and could not be reached for comment.</p>
