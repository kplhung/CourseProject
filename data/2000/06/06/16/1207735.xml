        <p>American trade restrictions on imported steel have cost customers in this country as much as $150 billion in the last three decades, a new study sponsored by foreign steel producers asserts.</p>
        <p>The report, written by lawyers for foreign steel makers and supported by the American Institute for International Steel, was dismissed by the Clinton administration as biased.</p>
        <p>The 300-page study takes aim at United States antidumping laws that it says protect domestic companies, including Bethlehem Steel and USX-U.S. Steel Group, against more efficient competitors in Japan, South Korea, Brazil and other nations. Those protections and some government subsidies effectively raise the cost of everything with steel components, from aircraft to kitchen utensils, it said.</p>
        <p>''American consumers and taxpayers have paid a high price to protect an antiquated industry that refuses to modernize and compete fairly,'' said Horst Buelte, chairman of the steel group. ''The vital interests of many key U.S. business sectors have been sacrificed to the narrow demands of the U.S. steel industry.''</p>
        <p>American steel-making companies have waged an intense campaign to persuade the Clinton administration to protect them against some foreign competitors in recent years. The companies pointed to a 30 percent surge in imports in 1998 that undercut the profitability of domestic steel makers, forcing layoffs and plant closings.</p>
        <p>Under pressure from the American steel makers and unions, President Clinton has imposed punitive duties on a wide range of steel imports, saying they were sold in this country at artificially low prices. In response this week, South Korea filed a case against the United States at the World Trade Organization, protesting measures Washington took to limit imports of line pipe.</p>
        <p>Robert S. LaRussa, acting under secretary of commerce for international trade, called the study ''totally ridiculous and absurd.''</p>
        <p>''Nobody is going to argue that the U.S. market is not the most open market in the world, especially in steel,'' he said.</p>
