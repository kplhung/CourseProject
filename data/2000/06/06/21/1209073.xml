        <p>Being Mike Tyson means never having to say anything. But his very presence induces an inimitable maelstrom of tumult and disorder, even in London -- the home, incidentally, of the reigning heavyweight champion, Lennox Lewis.</p>
        <p>The play of England's national soccer team in the 2000 European championships may be the top sports story here this week, but Tyson has managed to find his niche in the sports soap opera category.</p>
        <p>Today, he made news by canceling the only London news conference he had scheduled for Saturday's fight in a Scottish soccer stadium against Lou Saverese.</p>
        <p>Refusing to meet with reporters is not significant for Tyson, but since he has already postponed the Saverese fight twice -- and delayed his trip to London by four days because of the death of a friend -- it fueled new suspicions that he may still pull out of this fight.</p>
        <p>Then there was Tommy Brooks, Tyson's co-trainer, who said of his fighter, ''He's mentally distressed.''</p>
        <p>Brooks acknowledged that Tyson was disturbed enough by the June 9 murder of a longtime friend, Darryl Baum, that he considered postponing the fight last week. But then, there was the matter of his contract with Showtime. Brooks said of Tyson, ''He's trying to honor the agreement.''</p>
        <p>Tyson did take a walk along Park Lane, across from Hyde Park, followed by a huge contingent of reporters and photographers. Wearing a soccer jersey and matching shorts, he stopped to pose for a few photos and shook hands with some well-wishers.</p>
        <p>He has become a familiar public figure here. He took to the streets of London on Sunday as well, visiting a tailor on Bond Street by day and two wine bars in the Brixton neighborhood by night. English newspapers ran accounts of Tyson being mobbed at the wine bars. They quoted a female photographer who said she was rescued by Tyson when the crush of people rushing at the boxer knocked her over and pinned her against a railing. The photographer said Tyson interceded and saved her from injury.</p>
        <p>Late today, British television crews were camped outside Tyson's hotel astride Hyde Park hoping to catch his next absorbing foray.</p>
        <p>''The more Tyson does, whether it's good or bad, the more they want to see him,'' Saverese said today, a wily smile beneath a boxer's askew nose. It's like going to a car race to see a wreck.''</p>
        <p>One thing Tyson does not appear to be is woefully out of shape. It had been rumored that his weight had ballooned to 270 pounds, but walking past reporters today on his way to a brief workout, he looked trim. And calm.</p>
        <p>He also responded quietly to a question or two.</p>
        <p>''I came here to fight,'' said Tyson, whose appearance in London has also been opposed by leaders of women's groups, who did not want him, as a convicted rapist, granted entry to England. ''That's what I do. I'm a professional fighter.''</p>
        <p>This being the stealthy, shady world of boxing, where the referee's last command is always ''protect yourself at all times,'' there are some who believe Tyson did not meet with reporters or open his workout as planned because he is hiding something from Saverese.</p>
        <p>Eager to play along, Brooks said: ''We have a nice little surprise set up for Mr. Saverese. We've been working on some things.''</p>
        <p>Tyson had been expected to arrive in London last Wednesday, but instead he flew from Phoenix, where he had been training, to New York to attend Baum's funeral on Saturday.</p>
        <p>Tyson's handlers said Baum and Tyson had been friends since grade school. Brooks said Baum was like a brother to Tyson.</p>
        <p>''They treated each other like family,'' the trainer said.</p>
        <p>Baum had been with Tyson in Phoenix until June 8. Because he was not part of the group coming to England for the fight, Baum flew home to New York. He was shot on a street corner the next day.</p>
        <p>''I know Mike's hurting,'' Jay Bright, Tyson's other trainer, said. ''But he's very focused about these things. I never heard anything about the fight being postponed.''</p>
        <p>Maybe not, but when Tyson flew to London on Sunday, Saverese -- already training in Glasgow -- made sure he got the news.</p>
        <p>''When I heard he had landed over here,'' said Saverese, who flew to London today to conduct his scheduled news conference, ''I was doing back flips in Glasgow.''</p>
        <p>Wednesday, Tyson plans a last London workout. He may even entertain questions from reporters. Or he may not.</p>
        <p>Later that evening, Tyson is set to fly to Scotland. He is expected to be met at the airport by protesters opposed to his presence.</p>
