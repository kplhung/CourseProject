        <p>Talent Showcase</p>
        <p>From 18 countries -- among them Russia, Uzbekistan, China and Brazil -- gifted dancers, age 17 to 24, have journeyed to New York. And today through Sunday, under the eyes of judges like the ballet stars Cynthia Gregory and Julio Bocca, they are participating in the sixth New York International Ballet Competition at Alice Tully Hall. The event culminates on Sunday night at 7 with a gala performance and award ceremony.</p>
        <p>Summer Prospect</p>
        <p>Hot on the heels of summer's arrival comes the 22nd season of ''Celebrate Brooklyn!'' With the new Prospect Park Band Shell in Park Slope as its locus, this international potpourri offers classic movies (''West Side Story''), classic music (the Brooklyn Philharmonic), jazz and salsa, as well as performers like the zany Blue Man Group and the choreographer Donald Byrd and his group. Continuing through Aug. 19, the entertainment begins at 7:30 tomorrow night with the blues singer Susan Tedeschi, followed on Friday night by the Cuban music of Bamboleo and Barbarito Torres.</p>
        <p>Collector's Passion</p>
        <p>The names include Renoir, Matisse, van Gogh, Modigliani, Thomas Hart Benton, Charles Burchfield and Alexander Calder. Their art has been collected during the last 60 years by Chapin Riley, a pillar of Worcester, Mass., who later moved to the West Coast. Beginning on Saturday at the Worcester Art Museum, 28 paintings, sculptures and works on paper -- some from Mr. Riley's personal collection, others donated by him to the museum -- go on display. Assembled in the 19th- and 20th-century galleries, ''The Riley Collection: From van Gogh to Hockney'' is to be on view through Aug. 6.</p>
        <p>Art and More Art</p>
        <p>In the realm of art, this is the time when many roads lead to Basel. Today through Monday, the 31st anniversary Art Basel fair in that Swiss city brings together modern and contemporary works by more than 1,000 artists, presented by 250 leading dealers and galleries from Europe, the Americas, Asia and Australia. Basel's museums and galleries are also presenting major exhibitions, including the Vitra Design Museum's homage to the modern architect Luis Barragan and the Cy Twombley show at the Kunstmuseum der Offentlichen Kunstasammlung Basel. In ArtZappening from late Saturday night until early Sunday morning, cultural institutions in Basel's historic city center will offer open houses, concerts, performances and receptions.</p>
