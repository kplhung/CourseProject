        <p>Mike Hampton stood at his locker dressing silently, while Armando Benitez, one stall away, explained over and over the pitch he had thrown and the result of the pitch. Hampton did not look up as Benitez expressed his apologies for the damage done.</p>
        <p>Hampton had sat in the dugout less than an hour earlier, watching as Benitez, the usually reliable Mets closer, surrendered a leadoff home run in the top of the ninth inning to pull a hard-earned victory away from him.</p>
        <p>The home run, by Philadelphia's Pat Burrell, tied the score at 2-2, spoiling seven innings of hard work by Hampton. At least Hampton had made it that far after the elements conspired to ruin his last two outings, but that did little to soothe the Mets' frustration after Benitez gave the game away in the 10th and they fell to the Phillies, 3-2, at Shea Stadium.</p>
        <p>''It was a hanging slider,'' Benitez said of the home run pitch. ''He's a good hitter and he hit it. You can't do the job every time. Sometimes you have to lose. I feel sorry for Mike. He threw a real good game. I came in for one inning and I blew the game. I feel real bad for that.''</p>
        <p>Hampton said Benitez had apologized.</p>
        <p>''But the guy was what, 16 appearances in a row without giving up a run?'' Hampton said. ''You can't expect the guy not to give up a run the rest of the year. He tried to make a pitch, probably left it a little up, and the guy's got a lot of power and he hit the ball out. He's out there trying to make good pitches and trying to win. It's part of the game.</p>
        <p>''This is a team game. I'm here for one reason, and that's to help the team reach and win a World Series. We win as a team and lose as a team.''</p>
        <p>After Hampton left with a 2-1 lead after seven innings, John Franco pitched a perfect eighth and handed the ball to Benitez. But the hard-throwing right-hander gave up a home run on a 1-2 pitch to Burrell, ending Benitez's streak of 17 scoreless innings pitched.</p>
        <p>In the 10th, Benitez gave up a leadoff double to Doug Glanville. After Benitez struck out Ron Gant and Scott Rolen, Mike Lieberthal lined a hard single to center, scoring Glanville with the winning run. The Mets went down meekly in the bottom of the inning, as Jeff Brantley registered his ninth save.</p>
        <p>In his previous two starts, Hampton threw a total of just 79 pitches, battling the weather and an injury. Against the Yankees on June 11, he pitched two and one-third innings before the game was called because of rain. He started just three days later in Chicago, but rain pelted Wrigley Field and he pitched just one inning before the weather and a strained groin ended his day.</p>
        <p>While the injury healed sufficiently for Hampton to take the mound last night, he toiled through seven innings, somehow slipping around the holes he dug with control troubles to allow just one run and four singles. He walked six, his highest total since he issued six on May 3.</p>
        <p>''I was a little out of sync the first three innings,'' Hampton said. ''I started getting better as the game went on. I don't care if I walk 50. If they score one run I can handle it.''</p>
        <p>Mike Piazza provided an early cushion for Hampton, driving an 0-1 fastball into the left-field bleachers for a two-run home run off of Paul Byrd in the first inning, his 19th home run of the season.</p>
        <p>Hampton had a rough first inning. He walked Gant and Rolen in succession with one out, but got out of trouble by inducing Lieberthal into a 5-4-3 double play. While he did not surrender a hit over the first three innings, he struggled with his control, walking five and throwing 51 pitches, 30 of them balls.</p>
        <p>The Phillies broke through in the bottom of the seventh. Kevin Sefcik led off with a single that deflected off the glove of a diving Robin Ventura at third base, and Alex Arias hit a ground single just past second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo. Desi Relaford sacrificed Sefcik to third, and he scored on Glanville's sacrifice fly to right.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>Outfielder DARRYL HAMILTON was on the field before the game, working on his hitting and running. He met with Manager BOBBY VALENTINE to discuss plans for his return to the active roster. Hamilton underwent surgery on his left foot on April 7. ''Hopefully, by the weekend I will go and take it to another level, which is probably a rehab stint,'' Hamilton said.</p>
        <p>REY ORDONEZ, who broke his left forearm on May 29, was in town to have the cast replaced. ''I've been like a little baby,'' he said after struggling to put his uniform on with one hand. ''The last two weeks I had a lot of pain and I couldn't do anything. Now it's a little better. I put on about five pounds, but I'm starting to work out now.''</p>
        <p>BOBBY J. JONES will pitch Friday night against Pittsburgh at Shea since the team received a solid report of his last outing with Class AAA Norfolk. . . . PAUL WILSON threw on Monday for Norfolk and struggled, giving up six earned runs on eight hits in five innings.</p>
