        <p>Derek Jeter and Tino Martinez went out for lunch this afternoon, a chance for the Yankee teammates to think about something other than the task that faced them in a few hours: batting against Boston pitcher Pedro Martinez. They ordered pizza and the pie served to them was custom-sliced: PEDRO, it spelled.</p>
        <p>Hours later, Jeter earned the right to send his pizza back and have these words added: Loses to the Yanks. Jeter, Bernie Williams and Paul O'Neill slugged home runs against Martinez tonight and Andy Pettitte shut out Boston into the eighth inning as the Yankees beat the Red Sox, 3-0.</p>
        <p>George Steinbrenner is the principal owner of a first-place team once again. The Yankees (36-29) have taken the first two games of this four-game series to move one and a half games ahead of the Red Sox (35-31) in the American League East, and exactly one week after he spoke ominously about his team at Yankee Stadium, Steinbrenner cheerfully boarded an elevator on the third floor of Fenway Park tonight.</p>
        <p>''They did great,'' Steinbrenner said, words charging from his mouth. ''Pettitte pitched a great game. Any time you beat that guy'' -- Martinez -- ''you're doing something.''</p>
        <p>Martinez had allowed only three home runs this season before this game; he had not lost a decision to the Yankees since September 1998. One of the goals against Martinez, Yankee Manager Joe Torre said before tonight's game, is to try to stay even with the right-hander, to keep the game close and hope that you can beat the pitchers who relieve him.</p>
        <p>Ramiro Mendoza lifted the Yankees' morale tremendously with his performance here Monday night, when the Yankees crushed the Red Sox, 22-1, and Pettitte's teammates could see early tonight that he had the stuff and the focus to give them a chance to win again.</p>
        <p>He was working with alacrity, nodding in agreement to the signs quickly and pumping his two-seam fastballs for strikes, getting the ball back and throwing it again. Pettitte said afterward that it was as good as he had ever felt.</p>
        <p>A good thing, too, because Martinez was doing what he always does. The Yankees began the game with just 15 hits in their last 112 at-bats against Martinez, with 51 strikeouts, and Martinez retired the first nine hitters, six on strikeouts. The home plate umpire, Larry Young, called out O'Neill on a low changeup to end the first inning, and started the second inning by calling out Williams on a fastball belly-button high. Torre yelled to Young from the dugout, asking facetiously if the umpire was O.K.</p>
        <p>Pettitte faltered in the third inning, walking Jeff Frye with a runner on first and one out. Pettitte promised himself before the game that he would not allow Nomar Garciaparra to beat him on an inside fastball, but in this situation Pettitte whipped a cutter and Garciaparra singled to left; self-loathing overcame Pettitte as he ran to back up home plate.</p>
        <p>Left fielder Shane Spencer charged Garciaparra's single, thinking the ball was hit too softly for him to throw out Jose Offerman at home plate, but he tried anyway, grabbing the bounder quickly and firing, feeling as if he did not make the best possible throw because he had gripped the ball deep in his palm.</p>
        <p>The throw reached catcher Jorge Posada on one bounce, awkwardly, forcing Posada to draw both hands toward his chest. It appeared to Pettitte that if Offerman had slid, he would have been safe easily.</p>
        <p>But Offerman went at the plate standing, preparing to separate the ball from Posada, and he was out when Posada showed the ball to the umpire. The Red Sox did not score in the inning.</p>
        <p>Chuck Knoblauch singled to lead off the next half-inning, the Yankee fourth, before being picked off promptly with Jeter at the plate. Before the game, Jeter had held a remote control in his right hand, leaned forward and stared at a small TV screen, like a kid absorbed by a cartoon. What Jeter was staring at, actually, was videotape of Martinez.</p>
        <p>The best approach against him, Jeter said before the game, is to look for the fastball.</p>
        <p>''If you guess with his other pitches, you got no chance,'' he said. ''You can guess with the fastball and try to eliminate the other pitches.''</p>
        <p>Now, with a 1-and-1 count, Martinez threw a fastball. Jeter swung and smashed the ball halfway up the screen that is built above the monstrous left-field wall. It was only one run, but it was a lead, and Pettitte agreed later that it bolstered his confidence.</p>
        <p>Williams decided before the game that the best way to hit Martinez was to attack him early in the count, to try not to fall behind in the count and fall at the mercy of his other pitches. Williams, batting left-handed, led off the Yankee seventh and whacked Martinez's first pitch the other way, into the screen, close to where Jeter's ball had gone.</p>
        <p>O'Neill homered the next inning, a golfed liner that barely cleared the low wall of the Boston bullpen in right-center field. It was the first time Martinez had allowed three homers in one game since Sept. 24, 1998.</p>
        <p>Martinez left after eight innings, allowing one walk and striking out nine, but as Pettitte shut out the Red Sox through the seventh and into the eighth, the boos grew louder for the Red Sox, who have mustered one run in 18 innings at home against the once-slumping Yankees and have relinquished first place.</p>
        <p>Pettitte departed with two out in the eighth, having yielded six hits in a commanding effort, and Mariano Rivera got the final four outs for his 16th save.</p>
        <p>The Yankees shook hands in the middle of Fenway Park. If winning back-to-back games in this town, including a victory against Martinez, does not help the Yankees' confidence, Torre said afterward, then nothing will.</p>
