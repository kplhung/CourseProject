        <p>GODDARD-Ruth R. Truly a woman of the century, her enthusiasm for life and culture spanned many oceans and continents allowing four generations of our family to share in her warmth and caring love. We will miss you. Junko, Patrick and Mie Tam; Michi, Stephen, Matthew and Erica Ho (Japan and Hong Kong)</p>
        <p>GODDARD-Ruth. Ruth will be missed by scores of people who care for other people. Fare well to our one of a kind friend for half the 20th Century. She will be lovingly remembered. Herbert C. Bernard</p>
