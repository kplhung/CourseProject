        <p>Oracle Corp reports fourth-quarter earnings ended May 31 well in excess of analysts' estimates; earnings were $926 million, up 76 percent from similarly adjusted earnings of $527 million in year-earlier period; revenue rose 17 percent, to $3.37 billion from $2.94 billion in fourth quarter of fiscal 1999; total earnings for quarter were $4.91 billion (M)</p>

        <p>Propelled by strong sales of software applications for doing business over the Internet, the Oracle Corporation today reported fourth-quarter earnings well in excess of analysts' estimates. But sales of Oracle's core database product slightly trailed estimates, and Oracle shares dropped in after-hours trading.</p>
        <p>Excluding investment gains, Oracle reported earnings of $926 million, or 31 cents a diluted share, up 76 percent from similarly adjusted earnings of $527 million, or 18 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue rose 17 percent, to $3.37 billion from $2.94 billion, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999.</p>
        <p>Analysts had expected Oracle to earn 26 cents in the quarter, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.</p>
        <p>Total earnings for the quarter ended May 31 were $4.91 billion, or $1.63 a diluted share. Total earnings included a $6.5 billion one-time gain from the sale of 12 percent of Oracle's holdings in Oracle Japan; Oracle now owns 74 percent of the operation. This equity reduction was necessary for Oracle Japan to comply with the listing requirements of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.</p>
        <p>Oracle shares closed today at $86.046875, up 4.6875 cents, in Nasdaq trading, but dropped by $5 in after hours trading.</p>
        <p>''They had one chink in their armor, which is that database growth wasn't as strong as it should have been,'' said Robert Austrian, an analyst with Banc of America Securities. ''But that's balanced by the five gold stars they get in other areas. Their e-business applications really are taking off and that of course is the future of the new economy. Operating margins are on fire, and it's really a case of leading by example.''</p>
        <p>Oracle said a year ago that it would cut $1 billion from expenses, and company executives say that goal has been accomplished by using their own Internet-based applications for processes like sales force management and human resources.</p>
        <p>''We're now shooting for $2 billion,'' Geoff Henley, Oracle's chief financial officer, said in a telephone interview. ''Of course the second billion will be harder. It will have to come from higher revenue growth, but we're confident we can do that,'' he said. ''A billion dollars in annual savings translates to a 10-point improvement in our margins.''</p>
        <p>He said that in the fourth quarteroperating margin had risen 13.7 points, to 41.1 percent from 27.4 percent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Henley said the greatest contributor to the quarter's sales was the strong growth in applications, and he added that he sees this performance continuing in the first quarter. Oracle said applications software sales increased 61 percent, to $447 million in the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>''Sixty-one percent growth is just a stunning number, and the pipeline is absolutely awesome,'' he said, adding that he expected license growth to be higher in the first quarter.</p>
        <p>The apparent slowdown in database license growth reflects a shift in Oracle's sales model, not a longterm demand trend, Mr. Henley said. ''It is strictly a comparison issue,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The growth in applications was led by customer relationship management, programs, sales of which grew at a 161 percent rate. Companies use the programs to manage sales and service operations. Database software sales increased 12 percent, to $1.2 billion. Consulting, education and support revenues increased 7 percent, to $1.5 billion.</p>
        <p>Larry Ellison, Oracle's chairman and chief executive, said that during  the last quarter Oracle sold more application software than SAP, the large European software company,  ''$447 million vs. $352 million.''</p>
        <p>''Our applications business has been accelerating while theirs has been flat,'' he said in a conference call with analysts. ''We think we have a chance of rolling up the enterprise applications space.''</p>
        <p>For the year, adjusted net income increased 61 percent, to $2.1 billion, or 69 cents a diluted share, compared with $1.3 billion, or 43 cents a share, in fiscal 1999. Revenue grew 15 percent, to $10.13 billion from $8.83 billion in the previous year.</p>
