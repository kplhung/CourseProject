        <p>First Lady Takes A Turn as a Card</p>
        <p>TOM DRAPE had to laugh when HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON joined in the spoofing at a gathering of political reporters in Albany earlier in the month. Mrs. Clinton showed photographs of herself as a baby and as first lady meeting dignitaries like Pope John Paul II. But the images had been doctored so that she was wearing a Yankees cap in each photo.</p>
        <p>Mr. Drape, who designs satirical greeting cards, had more or less the same idea months ago, and has sold more than 200,000 copies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Drape calls it the ''fact is'' card. It is meant to be a birthday card.</p>
        <p>''The fact is, I've always been a Yankees fan!'' Mrs. Clinton declares in a balloon on the card, a Yankees cap on her head. Below that is a similar image of Mrs. Clinton, this time wearing a skullcap. ''The fact is, some of my relatives were Jewish!'' the caption says. Below that is another image of Mrs. Clinton, this time with spiky green hair and a pierced body part (her cheek). ''The fact is, I've always loved the Sex Pistols!'' Inside, the message reads: ''The fact is you look younger than ever! Would I lie to you?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Drape, who runs Red Tree Studios in Leawood, Kan., said that his cards were very nonpartisan.</p>
        <p>''We do cards about Hillary and Bill and George Bush and Bob Dole,'' he said. ''But the Hillary cards are going even stronger than ever. The 'fact is' card is our best seller on our Web site. Hillary is getting 40,000 hits a week.''</p>
        <p>But MAYOR RUDOLPH W. GIULIANI has not been one of Mr. Drape's targets, not even when he was running against Mrs. Clinton. ''We try for a national audience,'' Mr. Drape said. ''Even though I was personally interested in the Giuliani-Hillary race, that didn't have legs out here in the rest of the country. She may have a national following, but he didn't.''</p>
        <p>And REPRESENTATIVE RICK A. LAZIO, Mrs. Clinton's new opponent? ''We've started writing some things,'' he said. ''From what we see, he's going to give it more of a race there.''</p>
        <p>Mate for the Thing With Feathers</p>
        <p>The jeweler RONALD WINSTON -- whose father, Harry, dreamed up a quintessential stunt when he sent the Hope Diamond to Washington by first-class mail in 1958 -- calls it ''the soul mate to the Hope Diamond.'' It is a 41-carat gem known as the Dresden Green, a rare specimen that does not come with any known curses.</p>
        <p>For years, Mr. Winston has been trying to borrow it. Like Friedrich August I of Saxony, he wants to show it off, but not at coronations or dinner parties. A well-guarded display case would suit Mr. Winston fine. ''I went to Germany in the Iron Curtain days and started to negotiate,'' he said. ''It was just too difficult.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Winston persisted, and in October, the Dresden Green will leave Germany. It will be on loan to -- what else? -- the Harry Winston Gallery at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington.</p>
        <p>''Ronald Winston provided the energy and the inertia to keep this going,'' said JEFFREY POST, the curator of the national gem and mineral collection at the Smithsonian. ''In Dresden, they were conservative about wanting this piece to leave, as we would be with the Hope Diamond.''</p>
        <p>Blues Royalty On 42nd Street</p>
        <p>The deal that the blues guitarist B. B. KING has with the B. B. King Blues Club and Grill on West 42nd Street, near Eighth Avenue, calls for him to appear there 12 nights a year. Last night, opening night, was one of the 12 nights. But Mr. King was on stage early. A noontime warm-up.</p>
        <p>Someone asked if he had helped with the menu, and the one-liners started.</p>
        <p>''I didn't get to this size by not eating,'' he said, explaining that he liked fried dill pickles, but adding, ''I'm a semivegetarian.''</p>
        <p>So what about 42nd Street, now that it is lined with brand-new buildings? Mr. King said he liked it. ''I even walk out here by myself, lots of times.''</p>
        <p>Then, advice to the audience: ''Put your plugs in your ears. I am one of those old blues players who's played so long I can't hear, so I turn it up.'' He took one last swig of Diet Coke, handed the can to the trumpet player and started playing.</p>
        <p>''We'd like him to be here as much as he can,'' said STEVEN BENSUSAN, whose family runs the club under a license from Mr. King, ''but he's on a full touring schedule.''</p>
