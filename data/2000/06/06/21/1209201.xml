        <p>Albanese Development Corp unveils $95 million proposed 26-story apartment tower at Battery Park City that will use solar panels for energy, rainwater for use in toilets and possibly geothermal system for heating and cooling; building, described as first environmentally 'green' residential high rise in nation, described (M)</p>

        <p>Ever since humans crept into their first cave to get out of the rain, home has mainly meant shelter from the elements. A new 26-story apartment tower at Battery Park City will turn that basic idea on its head -- using sun, rain and snow to make the building work.</p>
        <p>Solar panels will collect energy to light the common hallways. Rainwater will be collected in a 15,000-gallon tank on the roof for use in tenants' toilets. And a geothermal system is being considered that would exploit the constant 50-degree temperatures of the earth for cooling in the summer and heating in the winter.</p>

        <p>Ever since humans crept into their first cave to get out of the rain, home has mainly meant shelter from the elements. A new 26-story apartment tower at Battery Park City will turn that basic idea on its head -- using sun, rain and snow to make the building work.</p>
        <p>Solar panels will collect energy to light the common hallways. Rainwater will be collected in a 15,000-gallon tank on the roof for use in tenants' toilets. And a geothermal system is being considered that would exploit the constant 50-degree temperatures of the earth for cooling in the summer and heating in the winter.</p>
        <p>The building, which state officials say will be the first environmentally ''green'' residential high-rise in the nation, will even have a water-recycling plant in the basement to treat waste water from sinks, showers and washing machines for reuse in landscaping and for flushing toilets.</p>
        <p>The full details of the $95 million proposal, put together by the Albanese Development Corporation, a major New York City-based builder, are to be announced today at a news conference. Work on the building, which officials said would be the first in New York to be built under an environmental tax credit plan signed by Gov. George E. Pataki last month, would start in early 2001 and take more than 18 months to complete.</p>
        <p>People familiar with the project, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that because some of the elements in the proposal were untried, the development team was committed only to exploring them. The below-ground thermal energy system, in particular, using pipes that would carry water down into the ground under the building's foundation and then back out in a closed loop, has never been used in any major New York high-rise, they said.</p>
        <p>Each of the approximately 250 rental apartments in the building will essentially have its own air supply: a dedicated filtration and humidity-control system connected to the outside of the building and controlled by the tenant.</p>
        <p>Apartment towers also have vastly different water-use issues than office buildings. The water-recycling plant in the basement will treat waste water and the storm runoff from the rooftop tank using a chemical-free combination of oxidizing agents and coagulants in conjunction with gravity filtration.</p>
        <p>The building's exterior will be designed by Cesar Pelli &amp; Associates, the firm that did the World Financial Center in New York and the Canary Wharf project in London, while the engineering work will be done by Cosentini Associates, which also worked on the Conde Nast building. The building's architect is Schuman Lichtenstein Claman Efron.</p>
        <p>One man close to the project said that the final exterior design would probably require some compromise between form and function. For example, he said, the proposal contemplates windows of different sizes, depending on the direction they face: larger on the south side for maximum light but smaller on the north to minimize heat loss.</p>
        <p>''The challenge,'' he said, ''will be to blend the environmental and the aesthetic.''</p>
