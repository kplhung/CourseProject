        <p>Earthworks  Kaye Playhouse</p>
        <p>Martita Goshen surely intended to create something grand when she choreographed ''Threshold,'' the multimedia piece that her company, Earthworks, performed on Friday night. Yet although the production was elaborate and its images may have meant much to Ms. Goshen, it remained strangely uncommunicative. This ''Threshold'' failed to open upon a realm of universal significance.</p>
        <p>Ms. Goshen conceived the work as a triptych. But its parts flowed into one another without pause. ''Prologue'' established the overall solemn tone. The other two sections, to a taped collage of music in various styles, combined dancing onstage with projected images of dancers on a screen, for which Jack Young was in charge of video production and Peter Richards was film editor. ''In the Chamber: Flashback'' showed views of a Greek hillside near Athens. ''Revelations: Coming Home'' was filled with scenes taken on an Irish coast.</p>
        <p>The choreography for both the live dancers and those on screen was similar. Treading solemnly, people kept shifting positions and raising their arms in stately and soulful gestures. Their actions had a ritualistic air without conveying even the slightest hint of what these rituals were supposed to symbolize.</p>
        <p>In addition to music, the taped accompaniment included recitations. ''I am water, I am fire, I am sustenance,'' said one voice. Another voice spoke of ''a time of peace, truth and growth.'' One had to take all this on faith. And when a voice kept repeating, ''I remember,'' one wondered what Ms. Goshen was trying so hard to recall.</p>
        <p>The live performers were Rachel Berman, Taryn Griggs, Patricia Durbin-Ruiz, Richard Kilfoil, Becka Vargus, Felicia Norton, Anton Wilson and Ms. Goshen.</p>
