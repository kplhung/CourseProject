        <p>As Gov. George W. Bush confronts yet another closely scrutinized death penalty case this week, the immediate decision before him is one that has become remarkably familiar over the course of 134 executions in Texas during his five and a half years in office: whether or not to use his limited power to halt the next one.</p>
        <p>But now that Mr. Bush is running for president and the eyes of an entire nation are upon him as never before, he faces a second, amplified challenge.</p>
        <p>It is to demonstrate, through the tone of his voice and the set of his jaw, that he feels the full weight of his responsibility. And it is to show, through his bearing and his choice of words, that he comes by his steadfast position in support of the death penalty after extensive soul-searching and careful thought.</p>
        <p>Because of the stakes involved, the emotions it stirs and the welling questions about the fairness of its administration, the death penalty has become one of the tests of Mr. Bush's seriousness, a quality he arguably comes by less easily than his levity or spunk.</p>
        <p>And while there is little or no hint in public opinion surveys that his  advocacy of capital punishment in  itself carries political risks, there is certainly reason to believe that more than a few voters are watching, and judging, the manner in which he  navigates this sensitive terrain.</p>
        <p>''He needs to be careful to portray this in the most sober and respectful of lights,'' said Bruce Buchanan, a professor who teaches courses on the presidency at the University of Texas. ''Any evidence of being perfunctory or lacking sensitivity is a problem for him, not necessarily in terms of politics but in terms of gravitas.''</p>
        <p>The current case in question is that of Gary Graham, scheduled to be put to death by lethal injection on Thursday in Huntsville, Tex. Mr. Graham was convicted of a 1981 murder largely on the embattled testimony of a single eyewitness.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush and his aides have said that because of the circumstances of this case specifically and the boundaries of the Texas governor's powers  generally, he may have little or no discretion over Mr. Graham's fate once the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles renders its ruling on the matter this week. If the board authorizes execution, the most the governor can typically do is grant a one-time, 30-day reprieve. And Mr. Bush's ability to do even that in Mr. Graham's case is in question, since  Gov. Ann W. Richards granted such a reprieve to Mr. Graham in 1993.</p>
        <p>But whatever the limits on Mr. Bush's discretion, they do not alter the burden on his public comments and demeanor when the moment of decision comes.</p>
        <p>''This gravitas issue is a very important one,'' said Stephen J. Wayne, a professor of government at Georgetown University who specializes in the American presidency.</p>
        <p>''I don't think he can say, in a snide way, 'I'm going through with this, he's guilty, period,' '' Professor  Wayne said. ''He's got to demonstrate some reflection in his words.''</p>
        <p>The capacity to do so is something that many Americans want in a president, said Professor Wayne, who, along with other political analysts, noted that there had been a few occasions when Mr. Bush failed to exhibit it.</p>
        <p>A profile of Mr. Bush in Talk magazine last year described a scene, which the governor and his aides have said was mischaracterized, in which he mocked the last-minute clemency pleas of Karla Faye Tucker, a convicted killer whom Texas ultimately executed.</p>
        <p>And there was a moment during a Republican presidential debate in early March when Mr. Bush laughed, perhaps somewhat nervously, when asked about a Texas lawyer who fell asleep during a trial that ended with  a death sentence for his client.</p>
        <p>Those examples are extreme. But there have been many other times when Mr. Bush, who seldom holds any private introspection up to public light, has responded to questions about capital punishment with strikingly terse answers conspicuously lifted from a well-worn script.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush and his aides seem to be at least partly conscious of that and eager to cast his ruminations on death penalty cases as prolonged and profound.</p>
        <p>That was the portrait of the governor that emerged in the autobiography he published last year, ''A Charge to Keep,'' written primarily by his communications director, Karen P. Hughes. An entire chapter of the book was devoted to the death penalty.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, for the first time since entering office, Mr. Bush granted a death-row inmate a 30-day reprieve, in defiance of the Board of Pardons and Paroles. The issue in the case was the possibility that further DNA testing could clarify the facts presented at trial, and Mr. Bush's decision allowed him to show that he was neither oblivious nor aloof to a central, scientific reason for the changing dynamics of the death penalty debate.</p>
        <p>On Monday, aboard the campaign plane that brought him out to the West Coast to begin a week of campaigning that he knew would be dominated by the latest scheduled execution in Texas, Mr. Bush was more voluble on the death penalty than usual.</p>
        <p>He said not only that he was standing his ground ''in the face of a pretty considerable movement to undermine the death penalty in Texas,'' but also that he understood the passion of that crusade.</p>
        <p>''I harbor no ill will,'' Mr. Bush told reporters. ''I understand it's a very emotional issue for people. It's an issue where fine people disagree.''</p>
        <p>Talking about how much attention he was paying to Mr. Graham's case, he emphasized that he had spent the entire ''trip from the governor's mansion to the plane'' -- a drive of 15 to 20 minutes -- talking to a state lawyer about it.</p>
        <p>Asked whether accounts like the one about the sleeping lawyer made him wonder whether people were getting fair trials, he quickly and succinctly responded, ''That's what the appellate process is for.''</p>
        <p>But several hours later, he returned to the reporter who had posed the question and pointed out that in that case, the defendant had confessed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush had clearly gone and done some research. He had just as clearly come to the conclusion that it was a good idea to let people know that.</p>
