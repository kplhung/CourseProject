        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Books Unbound, Life Unraveled,'' by John Updike (Op-Ed, June 18), brought to mind the day I packed up my father's apartment after his death in 1994.</p>
        <p>My childhood bedroom was now a library, and I painstakingly and lovingly went through each book, unable to discard any that were not completely falling apart. A friend I've had since high school helped me and shared the memories.</p>
        <p>I found my grandparents' books, my uncle's books, New York Public Library books circa 1920, my father's high school and college textbooks, my mother's best friend's poetry and so on.</p>
        <p>I packed them all up and sent them to Atlanta, where they are now the furniture of our library, which is one of my children's previous bedrooms and is a guest room for children and grandchildren.</p>
        <p>A heritage by Microsoft? I think not.</p>
        <p>NANCY COWAN WEISMAN  Atlanta, June 19, 2000</p>
