        <p>MAYOR JOHN SPENCER picks up a magazine in his office featuring a picture of Gen. Colin Powell and says: ''That's what we need, leadership. For presidents, mayors, superintendents.''</p>
        <p>The mayor thought he had found his brand of leadership in Andre J. Hornsby,  who was recruited from Houston two years ago as the first black superintendent of the perennially struggling Yonkers schools. Some saw him as arrogant and autocratic, but Dr. Hornsby wasn't afraid of taking on tough issues, and results were beginning to show in increased reading scores. But, Mr. Spencer said, ''He changed.'' And so, in an outcome some here liken to the break-up of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Rudy Crew, Dr. Hornsby was fired last week by a school board Mr. Spencer controls.</p>
        <p>All roads in Yonkers seem to lead to the 15-year-old federal court finding of segregation in schools and housing, which has shaped the script of recent history in Yonkers. In the case of the fired superintendent, that road is exceedingly short.</p>
        <p>In the mayor's view, the superintendent became too enamored of the court-ordered desegregation plan. When an appeals court overturned the plan last year, the mayor cheered, but the superintendent wanted to go back to court to urge that it be reinstated to cure ''vestiges'' of racial inequality. Dr. Hornsby, who has not spoken publicly since his dismissal, wasn't necessarily committed to the segregation designation. But he did want the $1.2 billion that the state and city would be forced to pay to finance the plan over 10 years.</p>
        <p>But the mayor, who is white, deplores the segregation label sewn to his city many years ago. ''Don't play that racism card, when none exists,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Many supporters and detractors of Dr. Hornsby say his firing was not about race, noting that his temporary replacement is black. But for some, the episode recalls the defiance of the 80's, when City Council members endured a contempt ruling rather than carry out the court's housing plan.</p>
        <p>''I think he wants to paint a picture that he's comfortable with,'' Andrea Stewart-Cousins, a Westchester County legislator, said of Mr. Spencer, ''that the city has gotten rid of all the problems with race and we're just moving forward as one big happy family.''</p>
        <p>In the view of Yonkers's leadership, the court order was always a spectacle, and an expensive one at that. It was imposed by outsiders, primarily government officials and Judge Leonard B. Sand of the United States District Court, and perpetuated by lawyers like Michael H. Sussman, the Orange County lawyer who represents the local N.A.A.C.P. The two-term Republican mayor lists among his accomplishments the dissolution of a state financial control board that monitored city government, and he saw Dr. Hornsby as a partner in delivering the state's fourth-largest school system back to local control as well.</p>
        <p>But some of the old issues intervened, even as people said they weren't there.</p>
        <p>Board lawyers prepared a brief showing that while the percentage of minority-group members has increased, from less than 50 percent in the 1980's to 75 percent of the 26,000 students now, black and Hispanic students are underrepresented in advanced classes and overrepresented in disciplinary actions. When the board kept the brief from being filed in court, it was leaked to the N.A.A.C.P., which used it to make a case for continuing the desegregation plan. Dr. Hornsby, who said he needed the money the court order would have assured, questioned the commitment of city officials to education.</p>
        <p>IT was then that Dr. Hornsby appeared to some as another outsider. ''It was an attack on my city,'' said Thomas Weibrecht, a school board member and Yonkers's capital projects administrator.</p>
        <p>But the Rev. Luther Evans of the Community Memorial Baptist Church sees city officials attacking the schools. ''He doesn't care about these kids because they're minority kids,'' he said of the mayor.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the mayor points out that taxes are increasing next year, partly to keep education spending high even as he says the state shirks its duty. The schools face a $24 million shortfall next year, and some officials predict hundreds of layoffs.</p>
        <p>''I think it's a very sad place we are at,'' said Maria Chiulli, the school board vice-president who supported Dr. Hornsby.</p>
        <p>Yonkers is in need of leadership. Here's how Mr. Spencer employed what he calls the Colin Powell style of leadership -- leading by building coalitions: He approached his appointees on the board and built a coalition for ousting the superintendent. ''I didn't do anything,'' he said. ''I just called for his head and went silent.''</p>
