        <p>Sudan, joining a growing list of pariah nations, is trying to create a new image for itself by engaging more positively with the world, the Sudanese ambassador to the United Nations said today.</p>
        <p>Sudan's immediate goals are ambitious. It is seeking African support for a regional seat on the Security Council beginning next year. It is also lining up international backing for a lifting of sanctions imposed four years ago when Sudan was accused of harboring suspects in an attempted assassination of President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt.</p>
        <p>Both intentions present problems for the United States, which keeps Sudan on its list of nations supporting international terrorism because, the Clinton administration says, the Sudanese government maintains links with Osama bin Laden, a financier of Islamic militancy.</p>
        <p>Diplomats say the United States has been working behind the scenes to persuade other African nations to deny the Sudanese one of the council's seats, which are rotated within regions. Some African envoys say the Americans have suggested that if Sudan withdraws its request for a seat, Washington may look more favorably on other issues involving Sudan, though no promises have been made about sanctions.</p>
        <p>American diplomats and Sudan's ambassador, Elfatih Mohamed Ahmed Erwa, deny that any direct talks have taken place between them. In an interview, Mr. Erwa said that no deal would be possible because Sudan would lose all credibility among Africans if it backed down.</p>
        <p>''We are not battling against the United States,'' Mr. Erwa said. ''Does the United States decide who goes to the Security Council or not?''</p>
        <p>Rather, he said, Sudan's president, Omar el-Bashir, has taken steps that demand a new look at Sudan.</p>
        <p>In recent months, President Bashir has sidelined Hassan al-Turabi, a powerful Islamic politician with whom he had shared power for years. The move, other diplomats say, could be risky because Mr. Turabi commanded a significant following. The government has also made some gestures toward negotiating an end to a destructive civil war with Christians and African traditionalists in the south who have refused to accept the Islamic government.</p>
        <p>''The U.S. wants to see a change of behavior,'' Mr. Erwa said. ''We think in Sudan there has been lots of change of behavior.''</p>
        <p>The Sudanese, in a letter to the Security Council this month, said that sanctions imposed in 1996, a year after the attack on Mr. Mubarak, were no longer relevant because Sudan had reached an agreement with Egypt, the aggrieved party, and Ethiopia, where the attack took place. Both accepted Sudan's argument that the suspects were no longer in Sudan, where they were believed to have hidden, and that the government had tried to find them.</p>
        <p>Diplomats say it will be hard for the United States to indefinitely block a council resolution lifting sanctions because they were applied largely on Egypt's behalf. The sanctions, including diplomatic curbs on Sudanese officials abroad and an embargo on Sudanese flights, were not strictly enforced, diplomats say.</p>
        <p>When Washington attacked a pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum in August 1998, the strike was not related to United Nations sanctions but was in retaliation for what Americans said were Sudanese links to terrorists whom Washington held responsible for the bombing of its embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.</p>
