        <p>THERE'S some interesting art at Jon Wurtzburger's Upper East Side penthouse -- Jeane Arp, Georges Roualt, Henry Moore -- but Mr. Wurtzburger, a former stockbroker in a retired-guy get-up of pink, yellow and lime checked shirt and chinos, rushes his visitor by, as a man does with an interest of his wife's that doesn't interest him at all.

        <p>THERE'S some interesting art at Jon Wurtzburger's Upper East Side penthouse -- Jeane Arp, Georges Roualt, Henry Moore -- but Mr. Wurtzburger, a former stockbroker in a retired-guy get-up of pink, yellow and lime checked shirt and chinos, rushes his visitor by, as a man does with an interest of his wife's that doesn't interest him at all. The ''Oh, that stuff'' hustle. And as a man does when he wants to avoid a subject.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wurtzburger says of another Henry Moore that they got it in '73, sold it when the art market skyrocketed later and one daughter was working at Christie's. No, he doesn't want that in the story.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wurtzburger, 66, is a man with a mission and one mission only: he wants to get out the word about AirLifeLine, an association of volunteer pilots who last weekend flew 160 children from Chernobyl to cities throughout the United States for medical care. He is the president of the group, which provides transportation to patients in financial need, and a pilot.</p>
        <p>He's also not crazy about discussing his financial success, although in this duplex with the glimmering views and the photos of the fund-raising wife, Reva, posing with Zubin Mehta, that's like not discussing the 1,200-pound gorilla in the room. A gorilla who collects.</p>
        <p>''I've no interest in the things I've done in my life before,'' Mr. Wurtzburger says, taking a seat in the den. ''I couldn't care less. I was on the New York Stock Exchange for 26 years. I traded for my own account, never did any trading for the public. I retired four years ago and I haven't looked back. I don't care about stock, I have no interest in anything commercial or financial anymore.''</p>
        <p>From the looks of this apartment, it would seem he no longer needs to be involved in anything financial, he is told.</p>
        <p>''We were lucky, we bought this apartment in 1970,'' he says. ''New York was going to the dogs.''</p>
        <p>Then, he steers the interview back to AirLifeLine.</p>
        <p>''I want to have people around the country know that if you're poor and need health care, particularly if you need to travel a distance to get chemotherapy or radiation or help with burns, you can,'' he says. ''That's what I'm interested in seeing in that newspaper of yours.''</p>
        <p>There are people who can spend decades in New York and still seem as if they're from out of town. This is Mr. Wurtzburger, a former governor of the New York Stock Exchange, who sounds, though he has never been in the service, like a retired Air Force man, perhaps out of a base in his home state in Maryland. He shuns the personal. He is direct.</p>
        <p>''You get where I'm at?'' ''I see where you're coming from.''</p>
        <p>How big is his Bonanza jet?</p>
        <p>''I see where you're coming from. It's a million-dollar plane.''</p>
        <p>It is only when telling stories about AirLifeLine and the missions he flies weekly out of Teterboro (N.J.) Airport that Mr. Wurtzburger seems relaxed. Even then he focuses on his passengers: the teenager born without a chin he brought to New York for reconstruction last week, perhaps. Life deals some people a pretty tough hand, Mr. Wurtzburger says.</p>
        <p>Ask him about his background, growing up in Baltimore, the son of a real estate investor, and he'll say it was middle class and tell you about working at the A.&amp; P. to get money for flying lessons.</p>
        <p>HE does not volunteer that his parents, Alan and Janet Wurtzburger, were art collectors and important benefactors of the Baltimore Museum of Art. Their gifts included sculpture by Alexander Calder, Jacques Lipchitz and Auguste Rodin. If people hear you're ''to the manner born,'' they believe everything is given to you, Mr. Wurtzburger will explain later.</p>
        <p>His boyhood dream is to become a doctor, but he has no talent for science. He goes into finance, marries his college girlfriend, has two daughters, flies for fun.</p>
        <p>In 1990, Mr. Wurtzburger hooks up with AirLifeLine. A typical mission: he gets a call on the floor of the Stock Exchange at 2 in the afternoon about a New Jersey man who can have a liver transplant if he can get to Cleveland within five hours.</p>
        <p>''Little did I know there was going to be a blinding snowstorm coming off of Lake Erie,'' he says, warming up to a war story. ''We made three missed approaches. It was such a bad night that the ambulance taking the man to the hospital slips off the road. The poignant thing is, he got his liver, but he had the nurses call me up to see if I was all right.''</p>
        <p>The difficult part of the job, Mr. Wurtzburger says, is losing passengers he has become close to.</p>
        <p>''This particular patient I flew back and forth 12 or 14 times to Minneapolis,'' he says. ''A 30-year-old lady, six children, double mastectomy. I fell in love with her; she had something I really wanted, which was serenity. I wanted to know how she got it.'' He pauses. ''How she was able to cope so well with her disease. I learned so much from her. She stayed at my house.</p>
        <p>''When we lost her, it was a very, very big loss to me personally. I learned so much from her, as I did from many of the cancer patients.''</p>
        <p>''Before I met this lady, the glass was always half empty. I think I was striving to see if I could do more instead of relaxing with what I was able to do. Like running, I was always forcing myself to do it faster, to get my heart rate faster.</p>
        <p>''And now, I'm not looking to do more except in this one area, getting sick people in the air. I only care about things that count in life.''</p>
