        <p>The Justice Department asked the full 12-member federal appeals court in Atlanta today to quickly affirm the immigration service's ruling that Elian Gonzalez should be able to go home to Cuba with his father.</p>
        <p>The department also asked the court to shorten the process by which Elian and his father could return to Cuba. The government's brief was in response to an appeal filed last week by Elian's Miami relatives to overturn the ruling by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.</p>
        <p>In its brief, the department asked the court, the United States Court of Appeal for the 11th Circuit, not only to decide in favor of the immigration service but to issue a mandate enforcing the ruling immediately. That would eliminate the usual seven-day waiting period after a decision.</p>
        <p>If the court accepts the government's request, Elian and his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, could board a flight for Cuba hours after the ruling.  Mr. Gonzalez is under a court order not to take Elian back to Cuba until the court issues a mandate.</p>
        <p>The most important remaining legal issue is whether federal courts should give great deference to the rulings of the immigration service in the case. In the absence of an explicit law, the immigration service had ruled that Elian, as a 6-year-old boy, could not request an asylum hearing on his own. The ruling meant that Elian's father, and not Elian's Miami relatives, spoke for the boy. The relatives have fought to have the boy remain in the United States.</p>
        <p>A panel of 3 of the 12 judges on the court decided that the ruling by the immigration service was reasonable and should not be reviewed by the courts. The Miami relatives asked the full 12-member court to reconsider the case.</p>
