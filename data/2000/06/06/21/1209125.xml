        <p>Judge Delays Restrictions In Microsoft Antitrust Case  The trial judge in the Microsoft antitrust case unexpectedly issued an order delaying the sweeping conduct restrictions he had imposed until a higher court affirms them.</p>
        <p>Until the order by the judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, the Supreme Court would have been called on to rule quickly on Microsoft's request to stay the remedy order -- or to decide that the case should be sent to the appeals court. Now the Supreme Court, or the appeals court, can review the entire appeal, and rule on it, before deciding whether to impose the judge's remedy, modify it or cancel it. The process could take a year or longer. [Page A1.]</p>

        <p>Publicis Reaches a Deal for Saatchi  Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the London agency company, agreed to be acquired by Publicis for about $1.9 billion in stock. Maurice Levy, the chairman and chief executive of Publicis, will head a merged entity, the Publicis Groupe, which will oversee the agencies now under the Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and Publicis banners. Saatchi &amp; Saatchi will continue as an autonomous unit. The American depository receipts of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi fell $1.5625, to $31.50, after increasing by 30.3 percent on Monday. Publicis dropped almost 12 percent. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [C6.]</p>
        <p>Oracle Posts 76% Gain in Earnings  Propelled by strong sales of software applications for doing business over the Internet, Oracle posted a 76 percent gain in fourth-quarter earnings, beating analysts' estimates. But sales of Oracle's core database product slightly trailed estimates, and Oracle shares dropped in after-hours trading. [C10.]</p>
        <p>Nasdaq Hits 4,000, but Dow Falls  Stocks were mixed as the Dow Jones industrial average fell 122.68 points, or 1.2 percent, to 10,435.16, and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index slipped 10.05 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,475.95. But the Nasdaq composite index gained 23.53 points, or 0.6 percent, to 4,013.36, closing above 4,000 for the first time in more than two months. The index is now down just 1.4 percent this year.

        <p>Digital Island Stock Jumps 31%  Shares of Digital Island soared 31 percent after the company said that it was working with Compaq Computer, Intel and Microsoft to create a network for delivering real-time audio and video on the Internet. [C2.]</p>
        <p>Goldman Sachs Profit Rises 21%  Overcoming big paper losses on some of its investments, Goldman Sachs rode its best performance in investment banking to a 21 percent increase in second-quarter profit, beating forecasts. Despite the solid results, shares of Goldman fell $2.625, to $89. [C2.]</p>
        <p>Breakup of Russian Utility Opposed  A group of foreign investors in Russia's electricity monopoly, Unified Energy Systems, has asked President Vladimir V. Putin to stop a corporate breakup that the investors say is moving too fast and would destroy the value of their holdings. [C4.]</p>
        <p>I Was a Teenage Phenomenon  David Nelms, president and chief operating officer at Discover Financial Services, a unit of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, was quite the industrious teenager. He ran a lawn service and made more per hour than his mother. He narrowly missed winning a $10,000 scholarship in a Junior Achievement competition. And he bought several rental properties, managing and maintaining more than 50 units as an 18-year-old landlord. All that before college, marriage and a Harvard M.B.A. The Boss. [C9.]</p>
        <p>Trade Deficit Narrowed in April  The nation's trade deficit narrowed to $30.44 billion in April from a record $30.6 billion in March as a decline in oil prices offset record demand for foreign-made autos, computers and consumer goods, government figures showed. The deficit is on track to reach $350 billion this year, compared with last year's record of $265 billion. [C2.]</p>
