        <p>The 39-year-old Matthaus, who was supposed to rescue the franchise this season, seems to be running against the wind less than a season after he was named Germany's player of the year.

        <p>No one would say it, but some MetroStars players grinned when asked yesterday if the team has been better off without Lothar Matthaus.</p>
        <p>The 39-year-old Matthaus, who was supposed to rescue the franchise this season, seems to be running against the wind less than a season after he was named Germany's player of the year. The MetroStars have been doing signifiantly better without him and Germany was eliminated in the European championships yesterday as Matthaus extended his international record by playing in his 150th game for his native country.</p>
        <p>Matthaus is expected to return to the metropolitan area over the weekend and will miss at least two more Major League Soccer games: tonight against D.C. United at Giants Stadium and Saturday at Colorado against the Rapids.</p>
        <p>''We'll give him a week to rest,'' Coach Octavio Zambrano said, after putting his players through two hours of practice at Kean University in Union, N.J. ''He's played a lot of soccer and he can use a little rest. He's a very important part of this team, but we made it clear when he came that this was not going to be a one-man show.''</p>
        <p>The MetroStars have won five of six games (one was a United States Cup game) since Matthaus left on May 13, and with 21 points, from 7 victories and 7 losses, the MetroStars have equaled their victory total from last year (7-25) and are within reach of first place in their division.</p>
