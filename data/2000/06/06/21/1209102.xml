        <p>The deal, which was announced after trading closed yesterday, would create a company with $475 billion in assets under management, 4,000 employees and 5.8 million mutual fund shareholders.

        <p>Alliance Capital Management, the giant New York money management firm, has agreed to acquire the privately held money management and research firm Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company for $3.5 billion.</p>
        <p>The deal, which was announced after trading closed yesterday, would create a company with $475 billion in assets under management, 4,000 employees and 5.8 million mutual fund shareholders. In trading after hours, Alliance, which is controlled by the French financial services holding company AXA Group, fell 2.9 percent, to $48.50.</p>
        <p>Alliance is publicly traded, but structured as a limited partnership. The deal consists of about $1.5 billion in cash and 40.8 million newly issued limited partnership shares of Alliance.</p>
        <p>After the death last year of Zalman C. Bernstein, the founder of Sanford C. Bernstein who changed his name after converting to Orthodox Judaism, executives have considered selling the company, including a public offering. After the stock offering in Goldman Sachs last year, Bernstein was left as one of the last prominent privately held securities firms in New York.</p>
        <p>The combination is another in a string of recent mergers and acquisitions among money management firms. Last week, the Boston-based money manager Nvest agreed to be acquired by the French money manager CDC Asset Management, in a deal valued at $700 million. On Monday, Old Mutual, a South African money manager, agreed to buy the United Asset Management Corporation for $1.46 billion. And last month, the UniCredito Italiano Group agreed to acquire the Boston mutual fund company Pioneer Group for $1.2 billion.</p>
        <p>''The industry is becoming very commoditized, and it's become very hard to differentiate yourself,'' said Christopher J. Brown, an analyst with Financial Research, a mutual fund industry consultant.</p>
        <p>The combination of Alliance and Bernstein, however, is larger than the three previous deals combined, and the new company will manage billions of dollars in retail and institutional accounts, including equities and fixed-income investments. It also brings together two firms known for different styles of investing. According to Alliance executives, the potential for more diversified offerings is part of the deal's attraction.</p>
        <p>''Alliance Capital is a recognized leader in the growth style of investing; Bernstein in the value style,'' said Bruce W. Calvert, chief executive of Alliance. Bernstein is also one of the largest managers of private portfolios for wealthy clients, a coveted field in the industry.</p>
        <p>''We will be able to compete effectively for institutional investment management assignments in any of the world's major markets,'' Mr. Calvert said.</p>
        <p>The divergent investment styles have led to divergent fortunes of late for the firms. Investors, who have been impatient with value-oriented investing during the technology-fueled bull market, have withdrawn $1.6 billion from Bernstein mutual funds this year, through April, making the firm's mutual fund division the industry's third-worst seller, according to Financial Research.</p>
        <p>Alliance funds, meanwhile, have had $3.5 billion in inflows over the corresponding period.</p>
        <p>Despite Bernstein's struggles, the addition of a value-oriented firm is considered critical to AXA's plans to broaden Alliance's investment offerings and be ''sort of an international Citigroup,'' according to Clare Nickson, an analyst at UBS Warburg.</p>
        <p>In North America, AXA also controls Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette and AXA Financial, formerly the Equitable Companies.</p>
        <p>THE MARKETS: MARKET PLACE  Correction:  June 24, 2000, Saturday  The Market Place column in Business Day on Wednesday about the acquisition of Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company by Alliance Capital Management misstated the amount paid in another recent deal between money management firms. Last week, Nvest agreed to be acquired by CDC Asset Management for $1.9 billion, not $700 million.</p>
