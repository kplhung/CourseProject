        <p>Fred Rosen, the founder of a long-established Manhattan public relations firm, died on Sunday at his home in Water Mill, N.Y. He was 84 and also had a home in Midtown Manhattan.</p>
        <p>He suffered from Shy-Drager syndrome, a neurological disorder, said his wife, Jane.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosen was born in Manhattan, attended public schools there and roved the United States as a teenager, riding the rails like a hobo.</p>
        <p>Later, he was a journalist for Current History, Holiday and other magazines. During World War II, he was in the Army in North Africa and Italy and was a roving editor of Yank magazine, the Army weekly.</p>
        <p>Early in the 1950's, Mr. Rosen established his firm, Fred Rosen Associates, which had clients including the government of India, the foreign trade ministry of Italy, the current Aga Khan's development projects, American Express, Goldman Sachs and The New York Times Company.</p>
        <p>Besides Jane, his wife of 58 years, he is survived by a son, Jeffrey, of Clinton Corners, N.Y.</p>
