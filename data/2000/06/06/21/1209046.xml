        <p>No one at the Earth Justice Legal Defense Fund, an environmental law firm in San Francisco, expected December 1998 to be the cruelest month. The holiday season is supposed to be about peace, not tribal warfare. But war is what broke out, over Yuletide decorations.</p>

That did not fly, either.</p>

        <p>No one at the Earth Justice Legal Defense Fund, an environmental law firm in San Francisco, expected December 1998 to be the cruelest month. The holiday season is supposed to be about peace, not tribal warfare. But war is what broke out, over Yuletide decorations.</p>
        <p>The fracas began when Christian employees decided to celebrate and the manager told them to decorate the office however they saw fit. But the firm's non-Christian employees, including Jews, Buddhists and Muslims, felt slighted, so the boss told them all to decorate their personal areas rather than one centralized location. That did not fly, either.</p>
        <p>''People went all out, and it became almost obscene with the excess,'' said Tracy Salkowitz, the executive director of the Northern Pacific region for the American Jewish Congress in San Francisco, who was brought in along with an outside lawyer to help negotiate a truce. ''They were angry and bitter.''</p>
        <p>In a half-day workshop that about 30 employees attended, the two arbitrators explained the law on religion in the workplace. Then Ms. Salkowitz asked people to describe what the holiday season meant to them. ''They said December was a dreary month; they wanted to keep it festive and celebrate the earth,'' Ms. Salkowitz recalled.</p>
        <p>The result was that employees created a festival committee in charge of seasonal decor, dressed up the lobby and other common spaces with greenery and tributes to the earth, organized a food drive and abolished the company party in favor of community service.</p>
        <p>Earth Justice's brush with religious discord is hardly a workplace anomaly. With the nation undergoing something of a spiritual revival, more companies are seeking to accommodate employees' religious needs by initiatives like letting people swap religious holidays, organizing prayer breakfasts or spiritual retreats, setting aside prayer rooms and even hiring on-site corporate chaplains. The Fellowship of Companies for Christ International, a Christian group, estimates that 10,000 Bible-study and prayer groups meet in the workplace.</p>
        <p>''It's to an employer's benefit to accommodate employees' religious needs,'' said the Rev. Diana Dale, the executive director of the National Institute of Business and Industrial Chaplains, in Houston. ''It's a core part of people's grounding, and it makes them more productive.''</p>
        <p>Sometimes, that means simply letting people take prayer breaks. At mondus.com, a shopping site for businesses in Manhattan, Farid Senzai, 30, a Muslim who is the company's director of business development, unrolls his prayer rug every afternoon and becomes unavailable for meetings.</p>
        <p>His co-workers, who include Christians, Jews and even a believer in the Hindu religion Jain, ''are understanding,'' Mr. Senzai said.</p>
        <p>''They don't bother me if my door is shut, and they'll go out of their way not to eat food in front of me during Ramadan,'' the Muslim month of fasting.</p>
        <p>The epicenter of American capitalism, the New York Stock Exchange, has also become a bit of a religious center lately. Jay Knopf, senior vice president of the brokerage firm Spear, Leeds &amp; Kellogg, has organized a mincha minyan, or afternoon prayer of Orthodox Jews, in a computer room at the exchange four days a week. (Agudath Israel, a Jewish advocacy group, says there are 99 workplace minyans in Manhattan alone.)</p>
        <p>''It doesn't cost the company a penny,'' Mr. Knopf said, ''and the employee has better job satisfaction.''</p>
        <p>Prayer at the exchange is not just for Jews, either. On Friday mornings, a Christian group gathers in a corner room.</p>
        <p>Such activities reflect the norms of a deeply religious society. In a recent Gallup poll, 95 percent of those surveyed said they believed in God, and 48 percent reported talking about their faith at work that day.</p>
        <p>Employers have taken note. The Society for Human Resource Management in Alexandria, Va., says 68 percent of 743 human-resource professionals at American corporations who were polled in 1997 said they offered flexible schedules for religious observances and 15 percent said they provided space or time for religious observances.</p>
        <p>Mixing God and the office is not to everyone's liking, of course, and it can be legally tricky. Complaints to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission about religious discrimination rose to 1,811 in 1999 from 1,584 three years earlier, though they still paled in comparison with 24,454 accusations of sexual discrimination in 1998.</p>
        <p>Federal law requires ''reasonable accommodation'' of religious practice in the workplace. Guidelines issued by the Clinton administration in 1997 say Federal employees have the right to express their beliefs, for example by keeping copies of the Bible or the Koran on their desks, as long as they do not interfere with the rights of others.</p>
        <p>The trouble is that ''employers don't know what their obligations and rights are,'' said Marc Stern, a lawyer with the American Jewish Congress in New York, who helped draft the guidelines.</p>
        <p>''If the employer is a devout Christian and he's running prayer breakfast, can he make everyone come?'' Mr. Stern asked. ''Are Christmas trees offensive to others in the same way a nude pinup is offensive to someone? Many firms have been operating under the bad advice to treat religion the way you treat sex, which is to ban it from the workplace.''</p>
        <p>That was the issue at Sandia National Laboratories, the federal nuclear research center in Albuquerque, N.M. The lab allowed an employee group that supported equal rights for gay people to meet on its property but turned down a Christian group's request for company recognition. The Christian group sued in May of last year, and its lawyer denounced Sandia's policy as ''an insult not only to believers in God, but to believers in freedom everywhere.'' Sandia declined to comment on that accusation. But John German, a spokesman for the lab, said the two sides reached an agreement in principle last Friday to allow the Christian group to meet on its premises.</p>
        <p>Some questions may not have satisfactory answers. Which holds precedence, Mr. Stern asked, a man's right to follow a religious stricture against working with women or a woman's right to equal employment opportunities? ''The secular-religion divide is too great,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Still, some people want to build bridges. Ms. Salkowitz, the American Jewish Congress official in San Francisco, started a project this month aimed at getting people to air their religious differences openly. ''You'd be amazed at the problems that arise,'' Ms. Salkowtiz said. ''But it's in a company's best interest to work it through. They did it at Earth Justice. You wouldn't even recognize them.''</p>
