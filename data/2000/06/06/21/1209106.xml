      <abstract>
        <p>Massachusetts public health officials say statistics suggest state may be first in which more babies are born to women over age of 30 than under it; statistics show among women who gave birth in 1998, about 43,000 were 30 or over, and that about 39,000 were under 30; in 1990, only 37,000 women 30 years or older gave birth, compared with 55,000 under 30; in 1980, number of new mothers under 30 was nearly triple new mothers 30 and over; graphs (M)</p>

        <p>At first, it seemed that it might be a statistical blip. But no, public health officials said today, it is a definite and striking trend: Massachusetts, they believe, has become the first state where more babies are born to women over the age of 30 than under it.</p>
        <p>State figures made public this week showed that among Massachusetts women who gave birth in 1998, about 43,000 were 30 or over, and about 39,000 were under 30. That contrasted sharply with state figures as recent as those from 1990, when only about 37,000 women 30 and over gave birth, compared with 55,000 under 30. In 1980, the number of new mothers under 30 was nearly triple the new mothers 30 and over.</p>

        <p>At first, it seemed that it might be a statistical blip. But no, public health officials said today, it is a definite and striking trend: Massachusetts, they believe, has become the first state where more babies are born to women over the age of 30 than under it.</p>
        <p>State figures made public this week showed that among Massachusetts women who gave birth in 1998, about 43,000 were 30 or over, and about 39,000 were under 30. That contrasted sharply with state figures as recent as those from 1990, when only about 37,000 women 30 and over gave birth, compared with 55,000 under 30. In 1980, the number of new mothers under 30 was nearly triple the new mothers 30 and over.</p>
        <p>''This is a trend, this is happening,'' said Deborah Klein Walker, the Massachusetts associate commissioner of public health.</p>
        <p>It was in 1996 that the over-30 mothers first slightly exceeded the under-30 mothers here, Ms. Walker said, and the increase in their dominance has been steady ever since.</p>
        <p>The rise in older mothers may be mainly of sociological rather than medical interest because there is no sharp change in fertility or healthy births at the age of 30 or thereabouts.</p>
        <p>But in Massachusetts, at least, it does bring one medical corollary: a slight rise in cases of low birth weight. That condition usually occurs in premature babies, and they are more at risk for problems like breathing difficulties and brain disorders.</p>
        <p>The link, said Dr. Fredric Frigoletto, chief of obstetrics at Massachusetts General Hospital, is that ''older women might have slightly more difficulty getting pregnant.'' These women, Dr. Frigoletto added, often ''resort to artificial reproduction techniques, which are associated with multiple births, and multiple births are associated with prematurity.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, Massachusetts, where insurance companies are required to cover infertility treatments, has the highest number of multiple births in the United States, and multiple births are strongly associated with low birth weights, those less than 5.5 pounds. According to the state statistics just released, in 1998 less than 5 percent of single babies were born at low birth weights, but 50 percent of twins and 92 percent of triplets weighed in low.</p>
        <p>The rise in multiple births means a change for health workers gauging and fighting low birth weights. Historically, low birth weights have occurred largely among poor young minority women, and have tended to be a sign of faulty nutrition and prenatal care. But now, with so many older mothers using high-tech help to have babies, the low weights are occurring more often among white, more affluent and more educated women as well.</p>
        <p>It is important to draw that distinction, state health officials say, because the numbers might seem to indicate that efforts at helping poor mothers were bringing little result; in fact, they say, they are making progress, but the low birth weight numbers are skewed by the pool of multiple births to older mothers.</p>
        <p>As for why Massachusetts has such a preponderance of older mothers, many attribute it to the large number of educated women in the state and their tendency to delay having children.</p>
        <p>Dr. Walker said she was virtually sure that Massachusetts was the only state to reach the point where more babies were born to women over 30 than under it. Federal reports on pregnancy rates and births do not break the numbers down by state, and officials at the National Center for Health Statistics said today that such figures were not readily available.</p>
