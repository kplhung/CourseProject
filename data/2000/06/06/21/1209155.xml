        <p>As soon as it was over, the tears rushed from the eyes of the most imposing man in sports, the most powerful player the National Basketball Association has seen in three decades.</p>
        <p>Shaquille O'Neal, just moments away from grasping his first championship trophy, was crying, in part, because he could no longer be slighted.</p>
        <p>Since leaving Louisiana State University after three years in 1992, where he failed to lead the Tigers to a national title, O'Neal has been regarded by many as a dominant individual phenomenon who perhaps lacked the instincts, commitment and fortitude of a champion.</p>
        <p>He has been mocked for saying to his detractors that he had won at every level except college and pro; derided for making movies and hip-hop albums in his off-seasons; and denied his place in history alongside the greatest centers in the game.</p>
        <p>When O'Neal was named one of the 50 best players of all time in 1996, some people scoffed that it was premature, that he was unworthy because he was without a title.</p>
        <p>But like one of his thunderous slam dunks, O'Neal, who on Monday became only the third player to be named the most valuable player of the regular season, the All-Star Game and the N.B.A. finals in a single season, can no longer be denied.</p>
        <p>''I've held emotion for about 11 years now,'' O'Neal said in explaining his tears after recording 41 points, 12 rebounds and 4 blocked shots to lead the Los Angeles Lakers to their series-clinching victory over the Indiana Pacers in Game 6. ''Three years of college. Eight years in the league. Always wanting to win. It just came out.''</p>
        <p>In major professional sports, championships define true greatness. Hakeem Olajuwon's stature rose tremendously after leading the Houston Rockets to the championship in 1994, and Tim Duncan was prematurely anointed the best player in the league when San Antonio won the championship last year.</p>
        <p>Now that O'Neal has won his title, what is to keep him from being viewed in the elite company of Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar?</p>
        <p>Besides Russell, whose string of 11 championships in 13 seasons is almost unfathomable, none of the great centers has been without blemishes in terms of winning titles.</p>
        <p>Chamberlain won only two championships in his 14 years and, like O'Neal, did not win his first until his eighth season.</p>
        <p>Abdul-Jabbar won his first title in 1971, his second season, but did not win another one until he was teamed with Magic Johnson in 1980. And like O'Neal during last year's playoffs, Abdul-Jabbar experienced an embarrassing playoff sweep, when the Lakers lost to Bill Walton's Portland Trail Blazers in four straight games after registering the league's best regular-season record in 1976-1977.</p>
        <p>Abdul-Jabbar went on to win four more titles with Johnson, James Worthy and a tremendous Lakers team. O'Neal has never had that type of supporting cast and, Kobe Bryant's periodic shows of greatness aside, was almost a one-man gang against the Pacers.</p>
        <p>In one of the best individual series, O'Neal averaged 38 points, 16.7 rebounds, 2.7 blocks, 45.5 minutes and shot 61.1 percent from the field. No other Lakers player averaged as many as 16 points a game.</p>
        <p>Lakers General Manager Mitch Kupchak said that O'Neal needs to make sure that his championship run is duplicated to erase all doubt about O'Neal's place beside Russell, Chamberlain and Abdul-Jabbar.</p>
        <p>''I'd like to see him put together a couple during a 10- or 12-year period, so people can look back at him and say he played 12 years, averaged 30-something points a game and had three or four championships,'' Kupchak said. ''Right now, you can include him in any discussion with Russell, Wilt and Kareem.''</p>
        <p>O'Neal has often been characterized as an unskilled player who dominates simply because of his 7-foot-1-inch size, but Pete Newell, the longtime guru who has tutored O'Neal, Abdul-Jabbar and Olajuwon at his Big Man Camp, said O'Neal has more post moves than any center to play except Olajuwon.</p>
        <p>''Shaq's got a spin move, and I don't think anybody ever saw Chamberlain use the spin move,'' Newell said. ''He's got a right hook off the glass that he's really perfected. He's got a little baby hook in the paint. He's got a step back. He's got a lot more shots than people give him credit for. Olajuwon had the most moves of any center because he had the great footwork, but he wasn't the physical force around the basket that Shaq is.''</p>
        <p>Under the leadership of Coach Phil Jackson, O'Neal rededicated himself, improving his conditioning, rebounding and passing and emerging as a true defensive force for the first time in years. Now, other than foul shooting, it is hard to find a weakness in his game.</p>
        <p>''Shaq's one of the 11 greatest players in the history of the game,'' Walton said. ''The first six are really easy: Russell, Chamberlain, Jabbar, Magic, Larry Bird and Michael Jordan. There's a lot of choices for the next four or five and Shaq is right in there.</p>
        <p>''You can never say who the best is. What matters is that Shaquille O'Neal, the way he played this year, regardless of the championship, established himself as among the best. And he's got a great foundation personally to build from, and with his newfound priorities of the team, defense and rebounds that's put him over the top.''</p>
        <p>But after the way O'Neal dominated the Pacers, Indiana point guard Mark Jackson, one of the game's most cerebral players, is ready to bestow Jordanesque compliments to O'Neal.</p>
        <p>''He's the best big guy I've ever seen,'' said Jackson, who is 35 and a 13-year N.B.A. veteran. ''And I've seen them all. I'm a student of the game. To have a guy as big as he is, as agile as he is, with athletic ability. He can do everything on the floor, with the exception of being a great free-throw shooter. He's the best to ever play the game at the center position. There's no question in my mind about that.''</p>
