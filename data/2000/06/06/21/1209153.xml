        <p>Dance for Joy Ministries, which  performed on Sunday afternoon, shares the gospel through dance with a thorough professionalism that is unusual in liturgical dance. The new,  30-member company is drawn from a school founded by Iris Cloud, a former member of Dance Theater of Harlem, in the Living Word Church in lower Manhattan.

        <p>Dance for Joy Ministries  TriBeCa Performing Arts Center</p>
        <p>Dance for Joy Ministries, which  performed on Sunday afternoon, shares the gospel through dance with a thorough professionalism that is unusual in liturgical dance. The new,  30-member company is drawn from a school founded by Iris Cloud, a former member of Dance Theater of Harlem, in the Living Word Church in lower Manhattan. The company puts on a very good show.</p>
        <p>The ringing gospel and religious popular music to which the dances are set has something to do with that. But the choreography, by Ms. Cloud and her performers, makes savvy use of the stage and of the varied levels of dance training and abilities of all the dancers.</p>
        <p>The well-rehearsed performers stand out for their lyrically expressive arms and hands. The movement is for the most part simple, using ballet and tap to sensitive effect. Highlights included the exciting ''Everything I Desire,'' choreographed by Chinyere Nwosa and Angela Potter, and the somberly joyous ''Order My Steps.'' ''Taking It Back,'' a rhythm-tap group number led by Allicia Rudolph, is a showstopper that would look right at home in Riverdance or a Broadway revue. What sets it apart is the inward joy and unself-conscious devotion that animate all the performing, most notably in ''He Loved Me With a Cross,'' created and performed by Patricia Gibson, Katrina Medley and Ms. Potter.</p>
        <p>Eyes shining, Ms. Potter gently and even comically embodies the forces of good and near-evil in ''Woman Thou Art Loosed,'' a suite based on the writings of T. D. Jakes, a Dallas minister, and set to his music. Rachael Davidson and Jacqueline Sawyer powerfully reclaim their stolen children in another highlight.</p>
        <p>The afternoon also included commentary by the ebullient Ben Harney and by Ms. Cloud, an elfin performer. The company's children's ensemble will perform on Sunday afternoon at the center, at 199 Chambers Street.</p>
