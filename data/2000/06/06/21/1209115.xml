        <p>Professional lobbying of New York City government officials increased again last year, as $12.7 million was spent by such companies as Anheuser-Busch and the Roundabout Theater trying to influence city lawmakers and bureaucrats.</p>
        <p>The increase compared with 1998 was small -- just 2 percent -- but it was the fifth gain in a row. The amount that companies pay firms to lobby the city has jumped by 50 percent since Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani entered office in 1994, according to the city clerk's annual report on lobbying, which is to be released today.</p>
        <p>The top lobbying firm for the fourth year in a row was the Albany office of Wilson, Elser, Moskowitz, Edelman &amp; Dicker, which billed $1.4 million to clients including the Hotel Association of New York City, the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts and the American Insurance Association.</p>
        <p>''Everyone wants to have an advocate on the city and the state level,'' said Peter A. Piscitelli, the partner in charge of the New York City office of Wilson, Elser. Mr. Piscitelli was a senior aide in the Koch administration, and his son, Anthony Piscitelli, is a senior aide to Mr. Giuliani, serving as the city's lobbyist in Albany.</p>
        <p>Another firm high on the list with close ties to the Giuliani administration, is Fischbein, Badillo, Wagner &amp; Harding. Ranked eighth among the lobbyists, it earned $389,195 in fees last year, a 21 percent increase over 1998. Two of the firm's senior partners -- Herman Badillo and Raymond B. Harding, the leader of the state Liberal Party -- are close political allies of the mayor. And Mr. Harding is the father of Robert M. Harding, Mr. Giuliani's deputy mayor for economic development and finance, and Russell A. Harding, president of the New York City Housing Development Corporation.</p>
        <p>Democrats and civic advocates have criticized Mr. Giuliani for several years for allowing a firm run by Mr. Badillo and Mr. Harding to lobby his administration, and have said it lobbied on behalf of only three clients in the year before Mr. Giuliani took office. Last year, it was paid to represent 32 clients, including Shaya B. Developers, a real estate developer, and Rite Aid pharmacies.</p>
        <p>''It's a matter of the appearance of influence and access to City Hall,'' said Gene Russianoff, senior attorney at the New York Public Interest Research Group. ''It's a serious issue.'' Mr. Russianoff himself is a registered lobbyist. (His group was paid $5,634 for lobbying the city.)</p>
        <p>Richard S. Fischbein, a senior partner at Fischbein, Badillo, said yesterday that overall receipts from lobbying New York City officials were less than 1 percent of his firm's annual revenue. Most of the lobbying work entails helping companies with land-use and zoning matters, he said, but he rejected suggestions that his firm took advantage of its close ties to the mayor. ''The whole concept is absurd,'' Mr. Fischbein said.</p>
        <p>The city clerk's annual report offers only a glimpse of actual lobbying efforts in the city, as many common forms of lobbying, like public relations or legal representation, are not included.</p>
