        <p>Major league umpires have a new union, but their new leaders have discovered, much to their dismay, that they are involved in the same old negotiations. After months of silence and hope for a quick labor agreement, John Hirschbeck, the president of the new union, said yesterday that he was ''very disappointed in baseball.''</p>
        <p>So disappointed, discouraged and disenchanted, Hirschbeck said, that umpires had discussed among themselves the possibility of a strike.</p>
        <p>He did not discuss the possibility of taking a strike vote, but he said: ''We started this new union with the hope of creating a less confrontational relationship with management than had been in the past with Richie Phillips and the old union. We weren't looking for controversy. We were trying to show good faith.''</p>
        <p>Later, he added: ''Their feeling of us is almost to take advantage of a new union. Rather than work with us, it's like they want to take advantage of us. Our cooperation shouldn't be taken for weakness or lack of resolve.''</p>
        <p>Hirschbeck talked by telephone from Boston, where he worked the the Red Sox-Yankees series. The interview was his first on the negotiations since they began, and the disappointment he spoke of was clear in his voice. Phillips, who has maintained a low profile since his ouster, did not return a telephone call seeking comment.</p>
        <p>Under an interim agreement, neither side can take any action against the other until July 15, and then only after it has given two weeks' notice, which cannot be done before July 1.</p>
        <p>Sandy Alderson, Major League Baseball's executive vice president for baseball operations, said the commissioner's office was prepared to deal with any action the umpires might take. ''We want to get this thing negotiated,'' he said, ''but it has to be done on reasonable terms.''</p>
        <p>Alderson said a lockout of the umpires ''is not something we've contemplated or would contemplate any time soon.''</p>
        <p>In talks conducted out of the glare of public scrutiny, the two sides had reached agreement in principle on other elements of the contract, but then negotiations stalled over four issues. They have not met in two weeks.</p>
        <p>Hirschbeck identified the thorny issues as control and discipline, free speech, salaries and jobs for the 22 umpires whose resignations were accepted last year following Phillips's failed mass resignation strategy. That strategy prompted Hirschbeck, Joe Brinkman and other umpires, mostly from the American League, to form a new union.</p>
        <p>The insurgents won approval of a majority of the umpires in a vote conducted by the National Labor Relations Board, but now, as leaders, they have found a new collective bargaining agreement no easier to attain than Phillips ever did.</p>
        <p>''I had hoped it could have been done a long time ago,'' Hirschbeck said. ''The big changes they're trying to implement are things we could never be satisfied with or tolerate in a contract.''</p>
        <p>Hirschbeck also said that Ralph Nelson, the executive in the commissioner's office who is in charge of the umpires, has become a focal point of distrust among the umpires. He said the relationship with Nelson has become ''very strained,'' saying, ''Many umpires have told me one thing was said to them and another was done; they are not happy.''</p>
        <p>In addition, Hirschbeck said, umpires have been fined for reasons they previously did not face. He said six umpires have been fined this season and believed that only one fine was ''somewhat justified.'' Some of the fines, he said, were levied after umpires allegedly did not run into the outfield to get closer to a fly ball.</p>
        <p>He said one umpire was fined $250 on that basis, another $500. ''He had no idea that anything about his on-field performance was wrong in what he was doing,'' Hirschbeck said of the latter umpire. ''It was about fly balls and coverage. All of a sudden he receives a $500 fine.''</p>
        <p>Alderson defended Nelson. He said Nelson did not do anything he did not know about.</p>
        <p>''It's not easy changing a management style when management to a large extent has abdicated its role over a period of time,'' Alderson said. ''We've never hidden our intentions here. We intended to exercise more control over the umpires. We are doing that and we expect to do it going forward.''</p>
        <p>Hirschbeck said the control issues, such as the fines, provided an example of why umpires want somebody like an arbitrator to hear appeals of disciplinary action against them. Management is against the idea.</p>
        <p>''They want total control over the umpires where they can walk up to an umpire and say you're done,'' Hirschbeck said. ''I'm not saying an umpire has to be like a Supreme Court judge and stay for life, but it's only fair to have some type of system in place where if an umpire does something wrong or needs to improve, he can go to someone who is impartial.''</p>
        <p>The two sides have discussed the possibility of having five-man umpiring crews, giving each umpire one week's vacation every fifth week. That plan could lead to the rehiring of some of the 22 umpires who lost their jobs.</p>
        <p>Hirschbeck said the two sides seemed to be moving toward a resolution on the 22, but ''where we had gotten seemed to dissolve at the last meeting.''</p>
