        <p>Teaching Gardens Threatened</p>
        <p>Two public schools in the Bronx have enhanced their sixth-grade life sciences curriculums by having students dig their fingers into the soil of nearby community gardens on plots owned by New York City. Both sites, however, are on city-owned plots that the city is now seeking to return to the tax rolls.</p>
        <p>Administrators at the two schools say that learning about cultivating seedlings has taught the students some elementary biology and mathematics, improved overall academic performance and turned many students into avid gardeners.</p>
        <p>On a recent school day in the Morrisania section, students from Middle School 158, working like Virgil's bees, planted beets and added flowers between the apple tree and the rose bushes in a garden on Union Avenue. ''We're planting marigolds around the tomato plants to keep the bugs away,'' said Jennifer Davila, 12, one of more than 150 sixth graders who began tending the quarter-acre plot this spring.</p>
        <p>M.S. 158's site and another a few blocks away maintained for the last four years by students at Community School 134 are among the hundreds of gardens that the city now wants to turn into housing. The schools are waiting for a ruling by the State Appellate Division, expected soon, that would lift a temporary restraining order and permit the bulldozing.</p>
        <p>According to CAROL ABRAMS, a spokeswoman for the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, 41 three-family houses are scheduled to be built on community  gardens in Morrisania.</p>
        <p>''If they tear it down, it will be back to texts for the students,'' said M.S. 158's assistant principal, DAVID H. MARZETTE.</p>
        <p>Playing Fields for N.Y.U.</p>
        <p>Since New York University sold its University Heights campus in the Bronx to City University in 1972, it has had no outdoor athletic fields to call its own. But thanks to a recently approved state plan for the conversion into a state park of the Eastern District Terminal, a seven-acre waterfront parcel in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, the university will be getting new home fields for softball, soccer and other sports.</p>
        <p>The school, which competes in the N.C.A.A.'s Division III, will lease the space for the playing fields from the state and pay for the construction, which will cost at least $3 million. The fields will be available for public use during the summer and between the university's games and practices during the school year.</p>
        <p>6 Fulbrights at Fairfield</p>
        <p>Fairfield University has six Fulbright scholars -- the most the school has ever had -- in this year's graduating class. The students were among about 1,000 chosen from 5,000 applicants for the Fulbright grants, the most prestigious scholarship awarded by the United States government.</p>
        <p>The scholarships, which pay for a year of independent study, research or teaching abroad, will send the Fairfield students to Britain, Japan, France, Germany, Australia and Poland.</p>
