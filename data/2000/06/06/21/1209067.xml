        <p>About four months ago an old woman receiving me in a once-grand, now dust-filled and neglected St. Petersburg flat was assuring me that her son, who had been in prison for a year and a half, was being used to get at Vladimir Gusinsky, a media mogul who owns the magazine where I work. I attributed her words to an understandable desire to get me interested in her son's case, perhaps by exaggerating its significance on a national scale. She had my sympathy, but I did not write a story.</p>
        <p>I should have -- not because the government is now making an issue of this man's business ties to Mr. Gusinsky, but because his experience is a perfect example of the sort of extralegal practice that made Mr. Gusinsky's arrest possible.</p>
        <p>The man's name is Dmitri Rozhdestvensky, and when he was arrested, he was the head of Channel 11, an independent television station in St. Petersburg. He was also a close ally of St. Petersburg's first mayor, Anatoly Sobchak, who lost his bid for re-election in 1996. Under his successor, Mr. Sobchak himself and many of his aides and allies were investigated by the federal prosecutor's office. Some were jailed. All but one -- Mr. Rozhdestvensky -- have been let out, and, one by one, cases charging corruption have been closed.</p>
        <p>In March 1998 Mr. Rozhdestvensky was charged with nonpayment of taxes. On a single day that month, investigators searched the apartments of 41 of his employees, including freelance journalists. In September 1998 the tax charges were dropped and replaced with embezzlement charges, which allow arrest. For the past 21 months, Mr. Rozhdestvensky has been moved from jail to jail in three different cities on charges that have continued to mutate: now he is accused of misappropriating company funds to build a summer house and illegally giving a member of his staff an inexpensive Russian car.</p>
        <p>Just weeks before Mr. Rozhdestvensky was jailed, his wife, Natalya, suffered a massive stroke. His lawyers have presented documents showing that she is unable to care for herself. Normally that, coupled with proof of Mr. Rozhdestvensky's own worsening health, would be enough to have him released from prison. But not in this case, because the prosecutors do not want him released. And in Russia, just as in the Soviet Union, the prosecutor's office has the right to review and overturn court decisions -- which is to say, to dictate them. In Mr. Rozhdestvensky's case, the term of pretrial detention has even been extended past the legal limit of 18 months.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rozhdestvensky's parents and friends hoped he would be released after Vladimir Putin became president: the two men had worked together in St. Petersburg and had been political allies. It is unclear why this did not happen. In a sense, the reasons don't matter. What does is that Mr. Rozhdestvensky's case is not all that unusual.</p>
        <p>All over Russia, the authorities routinely subject local businessmen and journalists to harassment and persecution. Though Mr. Rozhdestvensky was one of the most prominent businessmen and media leaders in Russia's second-largest city, his arrest has drawn precious little attention from either the domestic or international press. It was only when the same thing happened to Mr. Gusinsky, who was released on Friday after being accused of embezzlement, that the world took notice. (Though a low price paid by Mr. Gusinsky's company for stock in Mr. Rozhdestvensky's station figured in the case against Mr. Gusinsky, those charges have nothing to do with Mr. Rozhdestvensky's own case.)</p>
        <p>Russia today is a very different place than it was 10 years ago because it has people like Mr. Gusinsky, Mr. Rozhdestvensky and many others who create independent local and national media. But their existence is precarious.</p>
        <p>For a long time, we in Russia hoped that a new, democratic concept of freedom and justice would trickle down from Moscow, where it seemed to be taking hold, to the regions. Instead, we see the random injustice that remained typical for the regions occurring on a national scale.</p>
