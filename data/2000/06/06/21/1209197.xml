        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Amanda Hesser's article on restaurant lighting (''Dining by Flashlight: Restaurants Fade to Black,''  June 7) reminded me of dinner at home when I was growing up. My mother anticipated the current craze for feeding blind by decades. White candles were a must, and the chandelier was doused before dinner was served.</p>
