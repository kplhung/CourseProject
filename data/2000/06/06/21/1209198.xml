        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It was refreshing to see you address the federal government's inherent conflict in advising Americans on nutrition while promoting American agricultural products (''At a Nutrition Conference, a Bland Diet,'' June 7). While there are some serious concerns that must be addressed, the federal government should be applauded for introducing food safety into the nutrition guidelines for the first time and stressing the importance of hunger and nutrition assistance for those in need.</p>

        <p>It was refreshing to see you address the federal government's inherent conflict in advising Americans on nutrition while promoting American agricultural products (''At a Nutrition Conference, a Bland Diet,'' June 7). While there are some serious concerns that must be addressed, the federal government should be applauded for introducing food safety into the nutrition guidelines for the first time and stressing the importance of hunger and nutrition assistance for those in need.</p>
        <p>At City Harvest, food safety is one of the biggest concerns that we face when rescuing food for New York's hungry, who are at greater risk for food-borne illness. Proper education and training is critical to insuring the safety of all food, including that food that goes to feed those less fortunate. All people deserve access to safe, nutritious and culturally appropriate foods on a predictable basis.</p>
