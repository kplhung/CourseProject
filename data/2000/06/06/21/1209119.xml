        <p>The Clinton administration is quietly maneuvering to sidestep a contentious decision over whether to build a national missile defense system, playing down the significance of the Pentagon's next test of the system and leaving final decisions on deployment to the next administration, officials said today.</p>
        <p>Hoping to avert a diplomatic and political crisis over breaking the Antiballistic Missile Treaty of 1972, administration and military officials have begun emphasizing that Mr. Clinton faces a decision this fall only on whether a defense shield is feasible to counter missile threats.</p>
        <p>More binding decisions on building a radar site on Shemya Island in Alaska and deploying the first of 100 interceptor missiles do not have to be made until 2001 and 2003, well after Mr. Clinton leaves office, the officials said.</p>
        <p>''The only thing the president has to decide this year is whether to put out'' a request for bids to begin work at Shemya Island, a senior Pentagon official said. ''And even then, the contract will be written so the next administration can change it. The name of the game now is not foreclosing any options.''</p>
        <p>While Mr. Clinton has expressed support for building a national missile defense, something long advocated by Republicans, the administration's goals have shifted markedly in the past few months as the Russians have balked at revising the ABM  Treaty to allow the deployment of an American system.</p>
        <p>Administration lawyers have already drafted legal arguments for Mr. Clinton that would allow him to give a preliminary approval to move ahead with construction of the first phase of the system on Shemya Island, without having to announce a withdrawal from the treaty. Several officials said Mr. Clinton did not want to make breaking the treaty his lasting legacy in arms control.</p>
        <p>The administration imposed the deadlines that it is now having trouble meeting. The timetable was designed by the Pentagon to meet possible missile threats to American territory, specifically those posed by North Korea, which has an active ballistic missile program.</p>
        <p>Under the timetable, Mr. Clinton was faced with making a crucial decision of either moving ahead with the system or announcing a withdrawal from the treaty. That decision had been timed to the Pentagon's tests of prototypes of its highly complex system of radars and interceptor missiles.</p>
        <p>The lawyers' recommendations have now taken considerable pressure off the next test, which the Pentagon announced today would held on July 7.</p>
        <p>For months, officials have portrayed the test, which has already been delayed by three months, as a make-or-break milestone in the program's development. But now they say that because Mr. Clinton's decision does not have to be a final, binding one, the test's success or  failure is not as crucial to the Pentagon's plans.</p>
        <p>At a news conference at the Pentagon today, the undersecretary of defense for acquisition and technology, Jacques S. Gansler, suggested that the Pentagon could recommend moving ahead with the initial stages of development even if the next test is not a complete success. Because more tests are planned and the president must simply approve preliminary steps toward construction, the test need only to indicate the program is feasible, not actually ready to deploy.</p>
        <p>In the past few months, the debate over national missile defenses has become more complicated, particularly in light of the Russian refusal to renegotiate the treaty and what the administration describes as the surprising depth of opposition from allies wary that a defensive shield could spark an arms race.</p>
        <p>There is also a growing, bipartisan chorus from lawmakers on Capitol Hill urging postponement of a final decision on deployment to the next administration. The two presumptive presidential candidates, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Vice President Al Gore, have both expressed support for a system and not put pressure on Mr. Clinton to make any binding decisions.</p>
        <p>Administration and defense officials said the next missile test remains important but has become less significant as the administration tries to find a course somewhere between stirring a diplomatic crisis by moving ahead with the system and a potential political crisis for Mr. Gore by deciding not to.</p>
        <p>If all goes according to plan next month, an aging Minuteman II missile will be launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California toward the South Pacific. An interceptor missile will be fired from Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands about 20 minutes later and, after receiving communications from a complex array of radars and command centers, home in on its target.</p>
        <p>Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen said in a statement that the test would be ''our most demanding yet,'' but the statement went on to say that ''at least 16 more intercept tests'' were planned before the system is to be fielded in 2005, including eight before the decision in 2003 to actually buy interceptor missiles.</p>
        <p>The officials appeared to play down the test, in part because they fear it will fail. One senior officer rated the chances of success as no better than 50-50.</p>
        <p>The two previous tests of interceptor missiles had mixed results. One in October succeeded in striking its target, but the most recent one, in January, failed. The Pentagon has said it would need to have two successful intercepts before moving ahead, but, as Mr. Gansler suggested, officials appear increasingly confident that the system is at least technologically feasible.</p>
        <p>An independent review of the Pentagon's program, led by a retired Air Force general, Larry D. Welch, concluded in a report released today that the ''technical capability to develop and field the limited system'' against a relatively unsophisticated threat like North Korea's ''is available.''</p>
