        <p>Imagine if David E. Kelley were leaving ''Ally McBeal''; that would surely make news.</p>
        <p>But the creator and producer of another television phenomenon decided to leave his hit show a few months ago, and it happened with no fanfare at all, no announcement from the network, no word from anybody.</p>
        <p>Of course, the creator, Todd Kessler, is not quite as well known as his show, and ''Blue's Clues'' may not make the cover of Vanity Fair or even TV Guide.</p>
        <p>But the show is just as important to its network, Nickelodeon, as anything just about any program producer has supplied to any other network.</p>
        <p>''Blue's Clues'' has defined Nick Jr., the preschool component of the children's cable network, and established itself in just four years as a classic rivaling ''Sesame Street.'' ''Blue's Clues'' is seen by 14 million children a week.</p>
        <p>Perhaps even more important, it has spawned a merchandising empire, , from stuffed toys to lunchboxes to books.</p>
        <p>So why did Mr. Kessler's departure go unobserved?</p>
        <p>He said he simply had decided that ''it was time to move on.'' For him that meant creating a production company to develop and produce movies and television shows for grown-ups. Mr. Kessler said he was leaving with no hard feelings and was confident that his two production partners, Angela Santomero and Traci Paige Johnson, would maintain the show's standards.</p>
        <p>Brown Johnson (no relation to Traci Johnson), the Nickelodeon executive in charge of Nick Jr., echoed Mr. Kessler's outlook on the show's future. ''Angie and Traci really have a lot of great ideas about what they want to do with the show,'' Ms. Johnson said.</p>
        <p>But when asked whether any conflict with Mr. Kessler had led to his departure, Ms. Johnson said, ''I'm not comfortable talking about that.''</p>
        <p>She declined to elaborate, and Mr. Kessler gave no indication that any dispute with Nickelodeon influenced his decision to leave.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kessler is certainly not leaving the show empty-handed. He said he was guaranteed that he would be listed as executive producer on the show as long as it lasts. ''I'll also have that credit on any spinoffs they do as well,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Nickelodeon has already committed itself to producing two more years of new episodes of ''Blue's Clues,'' which runs twice each weekday on Nickelodeon, in the morning and afternoon. Soon the show will  have additional exposure when it becomes the centerpiece of CBS's children's programming on Saturday and Sunday mornings.</p>
        <p>That schedule, which will start in September, is an early example of the cooperation between the television holdings of Viacom, which now owns both Nickelodeon and CBS.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kessler was the first creator involved with ''Blue's Clues.'' He said he had hit on the idea of a show combining live action and animation after being asked by Nickelodeon executives to come up with a program concept for preschoolers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kessler then met Ms. Santomero, who had expertise in child development and education. They brought in Ms. Johnson, who was an artistic designer, and formed their partnership. All three have been listed as creators and executive producers of the show.</p>
        <p>One breakthrough concept that Mr. Johnson attributed to Mr. Kessler was creating all of the animation on a conventional desktop Apple computer. ''I've always believed in spending more on creative people than high-priced equipment,'' Mr. Kessler said.</p>
        <p>The show's other novel idea was to give young children the exact same show five days a week to make it easier for them to learn by repetition.</p>
        <p>Now Mr. Kessler is off buying short stories and novels to develop as theatrical movies. ''This is something I always wanted to do -- start my own company and make movies,'' he said. The company is called No Hands Productions. Mr. Kessler said he already had a deal with Miramax Pictures to develop a film based on a short story he had bought.</p>
        <p>''I did 75 episodes of 'Blue's Clues,' '' he said. ''That's a lot. I feel I've had so much impact with it, it's time to strike out on my own.''</p>
