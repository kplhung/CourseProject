        <p>New York's State Legislature moves this week into that slippery season when a number of bills could be passed into law -- or disappear -- with the speed that comes when politicians are ready to go home and campaign for re-election. With days, perhaps hours to go in this session, now is the moment for lawmakers to finish work on crucial issues that voters should remember on Election Day.</p>
        <p>Campaign finance reform: This vital legislation seems in danger of being lost within the power triangle that dominates the State Capitol. Gov. George Pataki, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and Joseph Bruno, the Senate majority leader, have separate plans. The Assembly version is the best, but a failure to agree on any reform would signal voters that Albany politicians think nobody is watching their gathering of special-interest money.</p>

        <p>New York's State Legislature moves this week into that slippery season when a number of bills could be passed into law -- or disappear -- with the speed that comes when politicians are ready to go home and campaign for re-election. With days, perhaps hours to go in this session, now is the moment for lawmakers to finish work on crucial issues that voters should remember on Election Day.</p>
        <p>Campaign finance reform: This vital legislation seems in danger of being lost within the power triangle that dominates the State Capitol. Gov. George Pataki, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and Joseph Bruno, the Senate majority leader, have separate plans. The Assembly version is the best, but a failure to agree on any reform would signal voters that Albany politicians think nobody is watching their gathering of special-interest money.</p>
        <p>Rockefeller laws: These outdated and barbaric drug sentencing laws skew the state's judicial system, robbing judges of the ability to fit the jail term to the crime. Under these laws, many nonviolent drug offenders serve more time than convicted perpetrators of violent crimes. It is a reform that needs some political courage, a rare commodity in Albany.</p>
        <p>Ballot access: After an embarrassing presidential primary election that tried to lock out Senator John McCain, there was hope that New York's notoriously closed ballots would finally be opened. A  winner-take-all provision weakens the bill, but the ballot access legislation being offered by Republicans still presents a rare opportunity for New York voters to have a wider choice of candidates.</p>
        <p>Guns: The governor's decent gun-control proposal would ban assault weapons, raise the age for purchasing guns and provide ballistic fingerprints. This bill should be passed as a move in the right direction, even if it would be improved by a stronger trigger-lock provision.</p>
        <p>Restructuring courts: Three years is long enough for legislators to protect their patronage appointments in the courts. It is time to endorse Chief Judge Judith Kaye's solid 1997 plan to untangle the court system. The overhaul needs constitutional approval, which means that it must be approved by two separate Legislatures. If this Legislature will not do it, voters should demand a better one for the next session.</p>
        <p>Physician profiles: A system like the one in Massachusetts that lists medical minuses along with the pluses should be approved to give consumers vital information about their doctors.</p>
        <p>Jet Skis: A law that grants local towns and communities the authority to ban these and similar personal watercraft deserves approval.</p>
        <p>Casinos: Legislators should make certain that the state's casino laws do not turn the Catskills into another Atlantic City.</p>
        <p>After this session is over, voters will be given a rare chance to choose a very important State Legislature this fall. Next year's legislators get to redraw their own electoral districts based on the new census. For such a golden opportunity to pick their own future voters, Albany's legislators should provide this year's voters with a larger and more distinguished list of accomplishments.</p>
