        <p>AMERICA has one great white wine, chardonnay. There are, of course, a host of runners-up: sauvignon blanc, chenin blanc, pinot blanc, pinot gris, viognier, riesling and a few hardly worth mentioning, like trebbiano.</p>
        <p>France, on the other hand, has an abundance of great white wines. They start with Burgundy and its superstars like Batard-Montrachet and Corton-Charlemagne. A few miles up the road toward Paris is Chablis, whose steely, green-gold wines have never met a crustacean they couldn't ennoble. Alsace offers its elegant rieslings. To some connoisseurs, wines like Trimbach's Clos Ste.-Hune and Zind-Humbrecht's Clos St.-Urbain are the finest of all white wines.</p>

        <p>AMERICA has one great white wine, chardonnay. There are, of course, a host of runners-up: sauvignon blanc, chenin blanc, pinot blanc, pinot gris, viognier, riesling and a few hardly worth mentioning, like trebbiano.</p>
        <p>France, on the other hand, has an abundance of great white wines. They start with Burgundy and its superstars like Batard-Montrachet and Corton-Charlemagne. A few miles up the road toward Paris is Chablis, whose steely, green-gold wines have never met a crustacean they couldn't ennoble. Alsace offers its elegant rieslings. To some connoisseurs, wines like Trimbach's Clos Ste.-Hune and Zind-Humbrecht's Clos St.-Urbain are the finest of all white wines.</p>
        <p>And then there is Sancerre. Is it equal to the others in breed and finesse? Perhaps not, but it is beloved in France and in much of Europe as the ultimate summer wine, a  wine for picnics (dejeuner sur l'herbe, as they say over there) and for parties. It may be France's friendliest white wine.</p>
        <p>Sancerre is a place, not a grape. It's in the beautiful Loire Valley about 120 miles south of Paris. The grape is the sauvignon blanc, which shows up in many Loire Valley wines, including Quincy, which almost rhymes with ''can't see'' and is the name of another town, and Pouilly-Fume, which is named for Pouilly-sur-Loire, across the Loire River and a few miles south of the village of Sancerre. The wine has lots of acidity and a pronounced herbaceous taste. At its best, Sancerre is fresh and lively and should be drunk young.</p>
        <p>(Don't confuse Pouilly-Fume and Pouilly Fuisse. Pouilly Fuisse comes from southern Burgundy and is made from the chardonnay grape.)</p>
        <p>The name Sancerre comes from castrum sancti satyri, which is Latin  for ''stronghold of the holy satyr.'' The name also lingers in a neighboring village called St.-Satur. What went on in those parts in Roman times is anyone's guess, but today it is wine country.</p>
        <p>FOR almost half a century, Sancerre has been the white wine of choice in Paris bistros. In the 1950's, production amounted to about 50,000 cases a year. Today, it's close to a million.</p>
        <p>Jacqueline Friedrich, in her book ''A Wine and Food Guide to the Loire'' (Henry Holt, 1996), traces Sancerre's popularity back to 1946, when Edward Alphonse Mellot, a Sancerre producer, opened a wine bar on the Avenue Rapp in Paris. Its name? Le Sancerre.</p>
        <p>''Artists, writers and gastronomes -- from Jean Cocteau to Jean Marais to Curnonsky -- regarded Sancerre as the little white they drank with shellfish platters,'' she wrote. ''Then Chablis prices skyrocketed after a killer frost in 1956. And autoroutes took Parisians past Sancerre on their way to the ocean. Its success has not yet peaked.''</p>
        <p>The best Sancerre doesn't come from Sancerre. It is to be found in neighboring towns like Bue, Chavignol and Verdigny. The best wines are sold under the names of locations within those towns like La Perriere in Verdigny and La Poussie in Bue. Some of the best producers include the Domaines Alphonse Mellot and Roger Neveu, Cotat Freres, and Pascal Joliver.</p>
        <p>The Mellots, who are led, according to Ms. Friedrich, by the 18th Alphonse, are one of the best-known families in the region because their wines are good and because they run a highly visible restaurant, Mellot, in the village of Sancerre, along with a tasting room and wine shop. Their best wine, Cuvee Edmond, is made from vines up to 60 years old and is partly vinified in oak barrels.</p>
        <p>The most talked-about wine in the Sancerre region at the moment is made across the river in the village of St.-Andelain, near Pouilly; it is Didier Dagueneau's Pouilly-Fume. Mr. Dagueneau is a highly vocal champion of low yields in the vineyards, and like many crusaders, he does not hesitate to denounce competitors who he contends make thin, characterless wines.</p>
        <p>Two of his most sought-after wines are Pur Sang -- Thoroughbred --  and Silex. Most Sancerres and Pouilly-Fumes sell in the $15 to $20 range. These two can sell for $50 or more.</p>
        <p>Some of my favorite wines from this region come from Quincy, about 25 miles west of Sancerre. The wines occasionally lack the raciness of the best Sancerres, but the best of them can be sharp and refreshing. Quincy is an appellation that nearly died out in the 1960's and 70's but has been growing and improving since then, thanks to the big demand for white sauvignon wines in Paris and across northern Europe.</p>
        <p>REUILLY, a few miles from Quincy, has much the same history, and some observers, Ms. Friedrich among them, believe that eventually it will emerge as a closer competitor to Sancerre.</p>
        <p>In the 1980's, Sancerre rouge -- red Sancerre -- became popular as the wine to go with nouvelle cuisine. Most Loire reds are made from the cabernet franc grape. Sancerre rouge is made from pinot noir grapes. But any resemblance to the pinot noirs of Burgundy or America's West Coast are accidental. Their popularity has declined with that of nouvelle cuisine.</p>
        <p>A few producers take their reds seriously, and the result is a full-bodied wine worth sampling as a curiosity. But the best place to drink Sancerre rouge is in the restaurants around Sancerre when the wines are fresh and young. There is also a pleasant rose. Come to think of it, aren't all roses pleasant?</p>
