        <p>Whirling around 180 degrees, the House today voted to allow the Department of Veterans Affairs to transfer $4 million to the Justice Department to help in its wide-ranging lawsuit against the tobacco industry.</p>
        <p>The extraordinary about-face took place on a voice vote and occurred less than 24 hours after the lawmakers had specifically voted to ban such a transfer, arguing that the Justice Department was taking away medical benefits from veterans to pay for its litigation.</p>
        <p>The measure defeated on Monday, an amendment by Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, would have permitted the transfer through revisions of a $76.3 billion spending bill for the veterans agency and the Department of House and Urban Affairs. It was defeated 207 to 197.</p>
        <p>Democrats crowed about the reversal today, asserting that it showed that when forced into a public fight in defense of tobacco companies, Republicans will ultimately back down.</p>
        <p>''We're not going to let them stop a lawsuit without people noticing it,'' Mr. Waxman said. ''We believe that when people do notice it, they can't  sustain their position.''</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, Republican of Illinois, scoffed at suggestions that the reversal was an embarrassment to his party's leadership by showing that it was unable to maintain a unified front on the tobacco legislation.</p>
        <p>''They made a decision that we had a good fight about taking money from veterans health care and giving it to trial lawyers,'' said Mr. Hastert's spokesman, John Feehery.</p>
        <p>The battle is not yet over, Mr. Feehery said, and there will be other opportunities to prevent the transfer of money to the Justice Department for use in the lawsuit, which is seeking billions of dollars from the tobacco companies to cover federal health-care expenses related to tobacco.</p>
        <p>A Republican amendment in an upcoming spending bill to fund the Commerce, Justice and State Departments prohibits the Justice Department from receiving any money for the lawsuit from other agencies.</p>
        <p>''This bipartisan victory should be a model for Congress,'' President Clinton said today in a statement praising the House vote. ''The legal responsibility of the tobacco companies should be decided in the courts by the judicial process.''</p>
        <p>Before the first vote on Monday, Attorney General Janet Reno had pressed lawmakers to defeat the measure blocking the transfer. If the Justice Department cannot get financial help from other agencies, Ms. Reno said, it might have to drop the lawsuit.</p>
