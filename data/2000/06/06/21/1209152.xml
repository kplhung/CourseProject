        <p>New York City Ballet  New York State Theater</p>
        <p>Both works by George Balanchine that the New York City Ballet performed on Sunday afternoon journeyed choreographically from contemplation into celebration.</p>
        <p>The progression was particularly impressive in ''Mozartiana,'' to a Tchaikovsky suite based on themes by Mozart. Kyra Nichols made ''Preghiera,'' the opening solo, a prayer in motion.</p>
        <p>The unhurried raising and lowering of her arms and the way her reverent gestures gave way to serene gliding steps seemed part of a heartfelt psalm.</p>
        <p>The choreographic meditations were eventually followed by a long  joyous pas de deux in which Ms. Nichols and Damian Woetzel appeared to be leading an elegant, but never stuffy, court dance.</p>
        <p>In their solo variations, Ms. Nichols was delicate and Mr. Woetzel's deft bounding steps suggested he was a wit tossing off epigrams.</p>
        <p>''Chaconne,'' like ''Mozartiana,'' starts quietly. Indeed, this ballet to orchestral excerpts from Gluck's opera ''Orphee et Eurydice'' initially appears to be set in Elysium, as women symbolizing blessed spirits move unhurriedly and with the utmost simplicity.</p>
        <p>The scene soon changes to an earthly festivity. Among the attractive merrymakers at this one were Jennifer Tinsley and Benjamin Millepied in a brisk duet, and Saskia Beskow and Eva Natanya as the women Robert Lyon serenaded by strumming an imaginary lute while he danced.</p>
        <p>The complex pas de deux was nicely danced by Margaret Tracey and Philip Neal.</p>
        <p>Ms. Tracey lacked the gestural amplitude that would have brought special radiance to the grandest passages. But her sweetness of manner was attractive.</p>
        <p>Looking aristocratic in bearing and sunny in disposition, Mr. Neal became a good-natured prince.</p>
        <p>Hugo Fiorato conducted. The program also included a repeat performance of Peter Martins's ''Harmonielehre,'' conducted by its composer, John Adams.</p>
