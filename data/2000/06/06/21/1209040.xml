        <p>Carlos Valdes, known as Patato, could be the Henny Youngman of conga drummers. He doesn't flaunt his virtuosity; most of the time he taps out structurally essential patterns that mesh with the rest of the rhythm section. But when a tune makes space, he knocks out a rhythmic volley with the timing and impact of a perfect one-liner.</p>
        <p>Mr. Valdes performed with important Cuban groups, including Sonora Matancera and Conjunto Casino, before coming to the United States in 1954. He became a major contributor to Latin jazz, working with Kenny Dorham, Tito Puente and Herbie Mann. He is so well known among musicians that Latin Percussion makes a Patato line of conga drums.</p>

        <p>Carlos Valdes, known as Patato, could be the Henny Youngman of conga drummers. He doesn't flaunt his virtuosity; most of the time he taps out structurally essential patterns that mesh with the rest of the rhythm section. But when a tune makes space, he knocks out a rhythmic volley with the timing and impact of a perfect one-liner.</p>
        <p>Mr. Valdes performed with important Cuban groups, including Sonora Matancera and Conjunto Casino, before coming to the United States in 1954. He became a major contributor to Latin jazz, working with Kenny Dorham, Tito Puente and Herbie Mann. He is so well known among musicians that Latin Percussion makes a Patato line of conga drums.</p>
        <p>Six Degrees Records has just issued ''The Legend of Cuban Percussion,'' a compilation of Latin jazz recordings he made in the mid-1990's, called ''Ritmo y Candela.'' Last Wednesday night at Nell's the arranger from those sessions, Enrique Fernandez, returned on flute and saxophone as part of a septet to play material from the album.</p>
        <p>It was a suavely audacious group that grounded the tunes in dance rhythms while heading for the modernist fringes. Oriente Lopez on piano sprinkled his vamps with chromatic harmonies akin to Thelonious Monk and Herbie Hancock. Mr. Fernandez's solos on flute and saxophones went twittering and vaulting through their variations; Pedro Emilio Rodriguez, on trumpet and fluegelhorn, was a straightforwardly tuneful contrast.</p>
        <p>Nicky Marrero on timbales played snappy rhythmic barrages, supported by Bill Elder's breezy trap drums and Chucho Martinez's imperturbable bass. Up from the audience, the singer Pete Rodriguez (El Conde), Pedro's father, and the trumpeter Jerry Gonzalez sat in.</p>
        <p>Mr. Valdes used his congas for both rhythm and melody. His drums are so tightly tuned that he can produce clear tones from them, and he started the set by playing the first riff of ''Son de Patato'' on his drums. From there he merged with the ensemble, sometimes playing a melodic counterpoint, sometimes using a sharply percussive attack. Most of the time he didn't insist on being noticed because he didn't have to.</p>
        <p>Mr. Valdes is to perform in a JVC Jazz Festival concert on Friday night at Symphony Space.</p>
