        <p>CONVENTIONAL wisdom has it that people either love gewurztraminer or hate it. I disagree. Most people have no idea whether they love it or hate it, because they've never tried it.</p>
        <p>Maybe people are scared off by the daunting name (pronounced guh-VERTS-trah-meen-er), or the wine's reputation for exotic flavors: gewurztraminer is usually described as tasting like litchis, rose petals and grapefruit.</p>
        <p>I happen to love this extravagantly fragrant white wine, but in small doses, because I find many gewurztraminers to be not very flexible with food. Their potent flavor tends to overpower most foods, although they are a fine accompaniment to choucroute garnie, the Alsatian sauerkraut and pork extravaganza.</p>
        <p>The solution to the food issue is paradoxical. Gewurztraminers range from dry and fairly simple to unctuously powerful, complex and sweet. Not surprisingly, the complex wines are more expensive, costing $50 or $60 a bottle, and generally do very well in wine ratings. But the simpler bottles, which balance the more exotic elements with a breezy dryness and citrus flavors, are better with food.</p>
        <p>Gewurztraminer is mostly identified with Alsace, where it flourishes in the region's cool climate, but it also does well in parts of Germany, particularly the Pfalz, and in some cooler areas of California, like the Anderson Valley in Mendocino County. Another dose of conventional wisdom has it that California can't produce good gewurztraminers, but examples from both Navarro Vineyards and Handley Cellars are just the sort of dry gewurztraminers that work with food.</p>
        <p>I don't mean to deride the richer examples. They are by all means great wines, and can be enjoyed as aperitifs or for dessert. But for dinner, stick with simplicity.</p>
