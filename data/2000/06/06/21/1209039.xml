        <p>''Boricua's Bond'' begins and ends with a cameo appearance by Big Pun, the Latino rap star from the South Bronx who died in February. He shows up in Val Lik's loud, incoherent ghetto melodrama to give some big brotherly advice to Tommy (Frankie Negron), an aspiring artist striving to transcend the squalor and brutality of his surroundings. Forget school, he counsels (his exact words are a bit more forceful, and can't be printed here). ''You want to be an artist? Then be one.''</p>
        <p>This is questionable wisdom in most circumstances. It seems nonetheless to have guided Mr. Lik, a Russian emigre who at 21 has written, directed and starred in his first feature film. He possesses evident conviction and some promise as a filmmaker, but the movie is so messy and overloaded, so poorly organized in its storytelling and confused about its themes, that you can only wish he had completed his education before tackling such an ambitious project. The movie, in any case, seems to have been finished by somebody other than Mr. Lik: an outtake reel at the end suggests that a half-dozen plot lines were left on the editing room floor. Some of them look more interesting than the half-dozen that were allowed to remain.</p>
        <p>In addition to Big Pun, a handful of hip-hop stars -- including Treach from Naughty by Nature and Method Man from the Wu-Tang Clan -- show up to lend credibility and box-office appeal. Mr. Lik was clearly aiming for the hard-hitting authenticity of the music, but his direction lacks the elusive quality of ''flow'' crucial to hip-hop and movies alike. He's good at capturing the loose, volatile rhythm of daily life, and his best scenes tend to be the least dramatic: a card game, a late-night party, an after-hours visit to a diner.</p>
        <p>''Boricua's Bond'' -- the title evokes Puerto Rican solidarity -- aspires to do for its milieu what  ''Mean Streets'' did for Little Italy or ''Do the Right Thing'' for Bedford-Stuyvesant. But Mr. Lik is out of his depth when he tries to elicit a big story from the gritty urban atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Tommy's drama of artistic aspiration, which is pretty trite to begin with, gives way to the struggle of Allen Miller (Mr. Lik) to survive the hostility of his new neighborhood. He and his mother (Robyn Karp), who have just moved to the Bronx, can't leave their apartment without being assaulted by gangs of angry young men, including Tommy's friends and his ex-con brother. To make matters worse, they're menaced by a corrupt policeman (Marco Sorisio), whose depredations lead to a series of climactic confrontations, each bloodier and less plausible than the last.</p>
        <p>Along the way a young woman is forced into prostitution, a son shoots his father, and Tommy's chunky friend Axel (Ramses Ignacio) insists on getting naked in a nightclub, at a restaurant and anywhere else the mood strikes. This seems to be Mr. Lik's idea of comic relief. For the most part, though, ''Boricua's Bond'' suffers from a fatal lack of modulation. It paints a picture of inner-city life as an endless sequence of beatings and shouting matches, and in its glum cartoonishness insults the people whose strivings it means to honor.</p>
