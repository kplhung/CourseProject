        <p>THEY go by so many names they would seem to be as common as corn: sea beans, sea asparagus, samphire, salicornia, pousse-pied, glasswort. Until recently, though, these salty little vegetables were just an oddity turning up once a year or so between the pea shoots and the cipolline onions in high-end produce markets. Now, thanks to new farming techniques, fresh sea beans are becoming more abundant and available.</p>
        <p>And they are more than a novelty. These little stalks of crunchy sea vegetation -- actually a fleshy flowering plant -- have a subtly salty flavor and a fascinating crispness that suits them to salads and other dishes. They can even be deep-fried to make the equivalent of French fries of the sea.</p>
        <p>The sea bean (Salicornia europaea), a member of the beet family, has long been considered a delicacy in France and Great Britain. The beans grow wild there along the shores of salt marshes and are gathered by hand when still young and tender, usually from mid-May through June.</p>
        <p>In Britain, sea beans are traditionally pickled and served with roasted meats, while in France they are often blanched and coated with butter or hollandaise or tossed raw into salads.</p>
        <p>Sea beans also grow in rocky coastal areas in the United States, particularly in Oregon and Maine, but have never been in much demand here. Now they are being cultivated, mainly in Mexico; these beans are more consistently tender than wild beans, which can be fibrous and woody at maturity. They are planted in sandy estuaries and harvested every six weeks.</p>
        <p>Chefs are taking to sea beans, and several markets carry them. At Balducci's, 155A West 66th Street and 424 Avenue of the Americas (Ninth Street), they are $14.99 a pound, and at Dean &amp; DeLuca, 560 Broadway (Prince Street), $12 a pound. Three 12-ounce packages are $30 from Melissa's Gourmet, (800) 588-0151.</p>
        <p>Dave Pasternack, the chef of Esca in the theater district, was introduced to sea beans more than a decade ago by a French chef. ''They've got an intense, briny taste that couples really well with fish and seafood,'' he said, adding that the less you do to them, the better. Blanching took away all the flavor, he said, ''so I either use them raw, pickle them in vinegar or give them a quick stir-fry.''</p>
        <p>With guaranteed supplies, sea beans have become a fixture on the Esca menu, served over translucent slivers of raw fluke sprinkled with herbs and olive oil. In one special, Mr. Pasternack mixes sea beans with the thinnest of green beans in a crunchy salad as a bed for a square of wild salmon.</p>
        <p>Mina Newman, the chef at Dylan Prime in TriBeCa, heard about sea beans from a supplier and was taken with the saltiness. ''They reminded me of capers, so I paired them with steak tartare,'' she said. The effect is similar to that of capers, but cleaner and fresher, without the vinegary tang.</p>
        <p>Most chefs capitalize on the beans' affinity for seafood. Rick Moonen of Oceana in Midtown adds them to a lobster salad; at Jack's Fifth in Midtown, the chefs, Matthew Herzog and Marc Van Steyn, match them with roasted tautog, a meaty, white-fleshed fish, and smoked trout. At Thalia in the theater district, Michael Otsuka pickles them to serve beneath baby monkfish tails.</p>
        <p>Douglas Rodriguez at Chicama in the Flatiron district takes a slightly different tack: instead of serving sea beans with seafood, he uses them instead of it in his seaweed ceviche. Although the citrus-marinated seaweeds served in the martini glass are delicious, the real standout is the garnish: nutty, deep-fried sea beans.</p>
        <p>If you buy carefully, sea beans need little preparation. Choose the greenest, firmest beans for the best crunch and flavor. Discard any that are discolored or shriveled. A short soak should dislodge any sand, and any tough ends can just be trimmed.</p>
        <p>DEEP-FRIED SEA BEANS  Adapted from Chicama  Time: 25 minutes</p>
        <p>1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour  2 tablespoons cornstarch</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric  Pinch salt  Vegetable oil for deep-frying  3 ounces sea beans (about 1 cup), trimmed.</p>
        <p>1. Place  1/2 cup of the flour in a small bowl. In another small bowl, whisk together the remaining flour, cornstarch, turmeric and salt. Stir in enough water, about 3 tablespoons, to create a thin, runny batter.</p>
        <p>2. In medium saucepan, heat 2 inches of oil to 365 degrees.</p>
        <p>3. Dredge sea beans in the plain flour, then in the batter, shaking off excess. Deep-fry in batches until beans are golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the fried beans to a plate lined with paper towels to drain before serving.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>PICKLED SEA BEANS  Adapted from ''Jane Grigson's Vegetable Book'' (Penguin Books, 1978)  Time: 20 minutes, plus cooling and chilling time</p>
        <p>3/4 cup cider vinegar</p>
        <p>3/4 cup dry apple cider  1 teaspoon prepared white horseradish</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon black peppercorns  6 ounces sea beans (about 2 cups), trimmed.</p>
        <p>In a small saucepan, bring the vinegar, cider, horseradish and peppercorns to a simmer. Add the sea beans, and turn off the heat. Let the beans cool in the liquid. Transfer the beans and liquid to a jar. Cover them, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours before serving.</p>
        <p>Yield: 1 pint.</p>
        <p>WILD SALMON WITH SEA BEANS  Adapted from Esca  Time: 30 minutes, plus chilling time</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons red wine vinegar  2 teaspoons minced shallot  Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste  7 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil  4 ounces haricots verts (about 1 1/4 cups), trimmed  2 ounces sea beans (about  2/3 cup), trimmed  2 tablespoons chopped Italian parsley  4 6-ounce fillets wild salmon, skin on.</p>
        <p>1. In a small bowl, combine the vinegar and shallots with a pinch of salt and pepper. Slowly whisk in 6 tablespoons of the oil. Season with more salt and pepper if necessary. Refrigerate vinaigrette for at least 3 hours.</p>
        <p>2. Fill a bowl with ice water, and set aside. Bring a small pot of salted water to a boil, and add the haricots verts. Cook until tender, about 2 minutes. Drain well, and immediately plunge into the ice water to stop the cooking. Drain again. Toss the haricots verts with the sea beans, vinaigrette and parsley, and reserve.</p>
        <p>3. Season the salmon on both sides with salt and pepper. Heat a large skillet, preferably nonstick, over high heat. Add the remaining oil and then the salmon, skin side down. Cook until the skin is well browned and crisp, about 5 minutes. Carefully flip the salmon, and cook until medium rare, 3 to 4 minutes. Divide sea bean mixture among 4 serving plates. Lay 1 fillet on top of each bed, skin side up, and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
