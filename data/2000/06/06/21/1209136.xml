        <p>Four senior executives of Barneys New York said yesterday that they were resigning, a move that could signal a new round of trouble for the fashion retailer.</p>
        <p>The four executives said that they would all be moving to Eve.com, an Internet retailer specializing in beauty products.</p>
        <p>Eve is financed by Idealab, the same Internet incubator behind Etoys Inc. and NetZero Inc. Its chief executive is the former Barneys chief executive, Thomas Shull.</p>
        <p>Among those departing Barneys are Catherine Nguyen, who had been vice president and a divisional merchandise manager, and Emilia Fabricant, a senior vice president. The other executives who left were Lisa Gorevitz and Julie Levy.</p>
        <p>Barney's Inc., which filed for bankruptcy in 1996, is now owned and run by two companies specializing in distressed properties, Whippoorwill Associates of White Plains and Bay Harbour Management of New York.</p>
        <p>Last May, they hired Allen Questrom, the former chief executive of Federated Department Stores, to act as the chairman and chief executive of Barneys.</p>
