        <p>The Senate voted today to defeat an effort to create a special commission to study the effectiveness of the American economic embargo against Cuba.</p>
        <p>The amendment was struck from the defense authorization bill by a vote of 59 to 41, after Republicans and a few Democrats rallied against it, calling the measure ill-timed, ill-advised and a backhanded attempt to change Cuba policy.</p>
        <p>The measure would have created a commission in which Republicans, who tend to support the Cuban embargo, would have been outnumbered by Democrats, who tend to want to end it.</p>
        <p>The defeat came as no surprise. Even Senator Christopher J. Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat who was one of the measure's sponsors, did not expect the amendment to survive. But it served a larger purpose today for critics of the Castro government: to keep the debate over Cuba policy alive in Congress at a time when the Clinton administration is softening on sanctions against other defiant  nations. On Monday, the administration announced the easing of sanctions against North Korea.</p>
        <p>Among those who voted to remove the amendment was Senator John W. Warner, the Virginia Republican. Mr. Warner, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, originally co-sponsored the measure, an indication of just how sensitive the issue of policy toward Cuba remains.</p>
        <p>Supporters of a commission said American policy toward Cuba was outdated. ''Castro is in no position to export revolution, none whatsoever,'' said Senator Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat, alluding to the country's financial crisis. ''According to the Pentagon, Castro represents no real threat to national security. So times have changed.</p>
        <p>''We have in place a policy that has not worked in 40 years. It was a different world in the 1960's.''</p>
        <p>But the measure's opponents argued that nothing has changed, so Cuba should not be rewarded by a commission likely to recommend ending the embargo.</p>
        <p>''This is the same regime that sent its troops to Africa to further the cause of Communism,'' said Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican, who said he supported lifting sanctions against the Communist government of Vietnam but only after it carried out new policies. ''It's the same regime that continues to repress and oppress its people.''</p>
        <p>The question of whether the United States should alter its policy toward Cuba, specifically on trade, took on new life this year, when a powerful coalition that included agribusiness giants increased pressure on lawmakers from farming states to open new markets. Human rights and major business groups have also lobbied extensively on this issue.</p>
        <p>Two Senate and House delegations sympathetic to weakening or lifting sanctions recently visited Cuba to see conditions there.</p>
        <p>House Republican leaders continue to grapple over how to proceed on a measure, which some of them oppose, that would permit the export of food and medicine to Cuba under certain restrictions. The measure, sponsored by Representative George Nethercutt, a Washington Republican, has delayed consideration of the huge farm spending bill. A similar provision has passed the Senate.</p>
        <p>While opponents of the bill, including Cuban-American lawmakers, say they will fight to block it, there have been recent signs of compromise.</p>
        <p>The House Republican whip, Tom DeLay of Texas, who has been a staunch supporter of the embargo, is now trying to broker an agreement between anti-embargo House members and Florida lawmakers who oppose sales to Cuba, his spokesman said today.</p>
        <p>The spokesman, Jonathan Baron, was quoted by The Associated Press as saying that while Mr. DeLay ''remains opposed to easing sanctions on rogue states, including Cuba, whenever there are disagreements in the Republican conference, the leadership works to resolve them.''</p>
        <p>Last weekend, the Cuban American National Foundation, an anti-Castro lobbying group, began running television ads reminding voters that Cuba is run by a Communist government.</p>
        <p>At the very least, Cuban-American lawmakers want to ensure that Cuba will be denied private and public financing to buy food and medicine. The Nethercutt measure excludes public financing and is silent on other forms, House Republican aides say.</p>
        <p>''American farmers are being told, if only you can sell some crops to Cuba, your crisis will be relieved,'' said Senator Robert G. Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat. ''Cuba has no money.''</p>
        <p>But Republican leaders face a quandary over how to handle Mr. Nethercutt in this election year. He is a Republican who faces a tough re-election effort in a one-time Democratic district. And he maintains that he has enough votes to win on the issue.</p>
        <p>Mr. Torricelli said he and the two Florida senators met with Senator Warner to try to persuade him to set aside the measure, arguing that the best time to create a commission is after a new president is elected. ''It makes more sense for a new president to consider the idea,'' he said.</p>
