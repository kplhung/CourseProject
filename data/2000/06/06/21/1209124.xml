        <p>The Nets star Stephon Marbury was robbed of a 24-inch diamond necklace worth $150,000 as he sat in a car in Manhattan early yesterday morning, the police said.</p>
        <p>Marbury told the police that he and a friend had just left a Manhattan nightclub and gotten into a Bentley parked on West 21st Street near 10th Avenue, when two men approached from either side of the car.</p>
        <p>One of the men reached through an open passenger side window, where Marbury was sitting, and grabbed the necklace, the police said.</p>
        <p>The men, who did not display a weapon, then got into a nearby car and drove off, Marbury told the police.</p>
        <p>The robbery occurred about 3:45 a.m., the police said, as Marbury left Aria, a club on West 21st Street between 10th and 11th avenues.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the Nets, Gary Sussman, said the team would have no comment ''until we get further details.''</p>
