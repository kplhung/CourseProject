        <p>Billie Jean King, who was reappointed yesterday as the United States Olympic women's coach, has a problem most coaches would beg for. She has four of the world's top eight ranked players at her disposal, plus the No.1-ranked doubles player, and they all want to repeat the 1996 American sweep of Olympic women's gold medals at the 2000 Games in Sydney, Australia, come September.</p>
        <p>Lindsay Davenport, the reigning gold medalist, Venus Williams, Monica Seles and Serena Williams have all told King they are eager to be on the team. Under Olympic rules, only three women per country may compete in singles; one doubles team is allowed.</p>

        <p>Billie Jean King, who was reappointed yesterday as the United States Olympic women's coach, has a problem most coaches would beg for. She has four of the world's top eight ranked players at her disposal, plus the No.1-ranked doubles player, and they all want to repeat the 1996 American sweep of Olympic women's gold medals at the 2000 Games in Sydney, Australia, come September.</p>
        <p>Lindsay Davenport, the reigning gold medalist, Venus Williams, Monica Seles and Serena Williams have all told King they are eager to be on the team. Under Olympic rules, only three women per country may compete in singles; one doubles team is allowed.</p>
        <p>''Someone is not going in the singles,'' King said in a telephone conference call. ''People are not going to be going both in the singles and the doubles. It is really hard.''</p>
        <p>In a sense, however, it is not as hard for King as it could have been, because the Olympic selection process is essentially dictated by the world ranking that will be released on Monday, July 10, the day after Wimbledon concludes.</p>
        <p>WIMBLEDON DRAW ANNOUNCED: When Wimbledon opens its two-week hold on British consciousness on Monday, the top-seeded players will have one eye on the match at hand and the other on the near future. So it is that Pete Sampras, who plays 80th-ranked Jiri Vanek, a 22-year-old Czech, in the first round, might well be looking ahead to a second rounder against the winner of the match between Slovakia's Karol Kucera and Spain's Juan Carlos Ferrero. Kucera reached the fourth round at Wimbledon last year and upset Andre Agassi at the French Open two weeks ago, while Ferrero was a French semifinalist.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the second-seeded Agassi plays a qualifier to reach a second-rounder with Todd Martin, who must first dispatch a qualifier himself. Tim Henman, all England's hope, who is seeded eighth, could face Goran Ivanisevic, a three-time Wimbledon runner-up who is unseeded for the first time since 1990, in the second round.</p>
        <p>In the women's singles, Martina Hingis faces a potential second-round encounter with Croatia's Mirjana Lucic, who surprised Monica Seles en route to the semifinals last year. Two first-round matches could provide untimely tests for eighth-seeded Serena Williams, who will have little time to work her balky knee into shape against the forceful Swede, Asa Carlsson, and for Anna Kournikova, who drew the tenacious, 10th-seeded Sandrine Testud of France.</p>

        <p>SAMPRAS IS ENGAGED: Pete Sampras, the six-time Wimbledon singles champion, said yesterday that he was engaged to be married to the actress Bridgette Wilson, 26. No wedding date has been set, Sampras, 28, said yesterday in Wimbledon, England, as he prepared to defend his title and capture a record-breaking 13th Grand Slam singles crown. (AP)</p>
        <p>RAFTER ADVANCES: Top-seeded Lleyton Hewitt dropped out of the Heineken Trophy tournament to rest for Wimbledon, and Patrick Rafter began his bid for a third straight title with a 6-3, 6-4 victory yesterday in Den Bosch, the Netherlands. Rafter beat the Dutch qualifier Dennis van Scheppingen in the $375,000 grass-court tuneup for Wimbledon. (AP)</p>
