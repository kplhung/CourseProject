        <p>The Giants will have a rare combined practice with the Jets during the teams' summer training at a neutral site -- West Point -- on Aug. 8. That would put the workout just about midway between the Giants' camp in Albany and the Jets' complex in Hempstead, N.Y.</p>
        <p>The Giants also announced yesterday that they would combine a practice with the New England Patriots on July 27 at the University of Massachusetts, two days before the Giants hold their intrasquad scrimmage.</p>
