        <p>The owner of Russia's largest independent media conglomerate appeared on his NTV network today in a live call-in show and charged that he was arrested and jailed last week at the behest of President Vladimir V. Putin.</p>
        <p>''I am sure that Putin knew,'' said  the media owner, Vladimir Gusinsky. ''Moreover, the decision was made personally by Mr. President.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gusinsky was detained last week on charges of embezzling state property and thrown into a Moscow jail. Following complaints from Russian tycoons, journalists and American officials that the arrest was politically motivated, he was released after three days and restricted to Moscow, pending trial.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin has insisted that he had no advance knowledge of the arrest, an assertion few political experts seem to accept. And tonight Mr. Gusinsky used his television program for two hours as a prime-time forum on the case.</p>
        <p>Leading pundits and politicians, including those who support Mr. Putin and the chief ideologist for the Communist Party, joined the fray. Viewers called in with their questions, not all of them friendly.</p>
        <p>Some wanted to know how Mr. Gusinsky had made his fortune and suggested that the media tycoon, a Jew who holds Israeli as well as Russian citizenship, managed to get out of prison only because of the power of the Jewish lobby. But there was also a female caller from Minsk, the capital of autocratic Belarus, who cast Mr. Gusinksy's case as part of a broader struggle for civil liberties.</p>
        <p>''Don't give in, and keep up the struggle,'' she said before abruptly hanging up.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gusinsky quipped that the call lasted less than 30 seconds and thus was hard for security forces to track.</p>
        <p>As the owner of the nation's only independent television network and several publications, Mr. Gusinsky has often been in the spotlight, but never as starkly as he was tonight.</p>
        <p>A 47-year-old former theatrical director, he is one of a small group of tycoons who have acquired enormous influence since the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gusinsky acknowledged tonight that he had deviated from the principle of journalistic objectivity and used his company, Media-Most, to help re-elect President Boris N. Yeltsin in 1996. He said he now regretted that role, which he said had led to a quasi-autocratic government of aides intent on preserving their own power.</p>
        <p>''We committed a serious error in 1996,'' Mr. Gusinsky said. ''In 1996, we gave birth to a small monster which has since grown into the present system.''</p>
        <p>The injustice of the current system, he insisted, was driven home to him during his brief stay in the Butyrskaya jail, where he encountered inmates who had spent months in jail on the flimsy charges.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gusinsky was held in preventative detention for several days before he was charged and sought to challenge the legality of his arrest today in court. But a Moscow court threw out his appeal.</p>
        <p>While his view of Mr. Putin's role is widely shared in the media, the tycoon did not say how he had determined that the president was behind his arrest.</p>
        <p>He also said he was convinced that Aleksandr Voloshin, the Kremlin chief of staff, did not have advance knowledge of his detention. ''But that does not relieve him of his responsibility,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Many questions seemed to have more to do with Mr. Gusinsky than with Mr. Putin. Some wanted to know, for instance, whether it was possible to be both rich and honest in Russia.</p>
        <p>The network's anchor, Yevgeny Kiselyov, asked Mr. Gusinsky to explain why he held Israeli citizenship, why his family lived abroad and why he paid personal income tax in Gibraltar, questions that appeared intended to give him an opportunity to explain his life to the Russian public.</p>
        <p>While much of the power elite feared that Mr. Gusinsky's arrest might signal a broader crackdown, Mr. Putin continues to be popular with much of the public, which likes his vision of a strong state.</p>
        <p>One journalist, Aleksandr Minkin, said much of the country seemed to perceive the case differently than  Moscow-based opinion-makers did. That seemed to be underscored by a questioner who suggested that the media tycoon was part of a system of corrupt insider deals.</p>
        <p>In reply, Mr. Gusinsky noted the gains Russia has made in free speech and press freedom -- a development his media empire has contributed to substantially.</p>
        <p>''I am not asking for sympathy,'' he said. ''But the fact that you could ask that question without ending up on the prison bunks where I was indicates that things have improved.''</p>
