        <p>Shares of Digital Island Inc. soared 31 percent today after the company said that it was working with Compaq Computer, Intel and Microsoft to create a network for delivering real-time audio and video on the Internet.</p>
        <p>So-called streaming technology, made popular by Real Player from Real Networks, QuickTime from Apple Computer and Windows Media Player from Microsoft, allows the distribution of full-motion video over the Internet.</p>
        <p>Compaq, Intel and Microsoft said they would make a combined equity investment of $45 million in Digital Island, which is based here. Digital Island is the No. 2 provider, after Akamai Technologies Inc., of Internet content delivery services, which seek to speed Web pages by distributing the content from servers closer to the user.</p>
        <p>Both Digital Island and Akamai moved into streaming media services earlier this year, when Digital Island acquired Live On Line and Akamai bought Network24 Communications, both of which provide streaming production services for corporate and entertainment clients. Digital Island, Akamai and Intervu, which has an alliance with Microsoft, want their streaming services to become the foundation for Internet television, but competition will be intense as AT&amp;T, UUNet and Intel also enter the market.</p>
        <p>Shares of Digital Island rose $10.6875 today, to $45.1875, in Nasdaq trading. Other streaming media and content delivery stocks also rose.</p>
        <p>Digital Island said it would roll out the network over the next two years and that it would ultimately support up to 7.5 million simultaneous media streams over the Internet. Digital Island has committed itself to deploying 8,000 Compaq ProLiant servers, which use the Intel Pentium III microprocessor, and to using Media Player in the network. Compaq's Financial Services unit will provide $50 million in equipment lease financing to Digital Island and an additional $50 million in financing to customers.</p>
        <p>''The target customer here is the enterprise or corporation that wants to do real business using the Internet and sees the value of a rich media experience in doing that,'' RuAnn Ernst, Digital Island's chairman and chief executive, said in a telephone interview. ''That kind of rich media experience creates more transactions, creates the decision to push the 'buy button' and that has been demonstrated with customers.''</p>
