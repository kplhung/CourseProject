        <p>SIX years after Maurice Saatchi left Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, there's a new Maurice in charge, only this time the name is pronounced the French way rather than the British.</p>
        <p>Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the London agency company founded by Mr. Saatchi and his brother, Charles, agreed yesterday to be acquired by a Paris-based rival, Publicis S.A., for about $1.9 billion in stock. Maurice Levy, the chairman and chief executive of Publicis, who is proving to be almost as acquisitive as the Saatchis have been, will head a merged entity, the Publicis Groupe, which will oversee the agencies now under the Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and Publicis banners.</p>
        <p>Saatchi &amp; Saatchi will continue as an autonomous unit of the Publicis Groupe rather than operate independently. That is emblematic of the dwindling ranks of agencies not owned by giant holding companies amid a whirlwind of deals like the pending takeovers of Young &amp; Rubicam by the WPP Group and Snyder Communications by Havas Advertising.</p>
        <p>''The WPP deal is a confirmation consolidation is happening, and we had to make some decisions,'' Mr. Levy said in a telephone interview yesterday after a news conference in Paris. Discussions began in December, he added, and turned serious in March, before he unsuccessfully offered Publicis as an alternate buyer for Y.&amp; R.</p>
        <p>Word began leaking out on Monday as Mr. Levy made plans for his news conference to disclose the deal, the most recent in a spate that has included familiar names like Fallon, Frankel and Hal Riney &amp; Partners. The deal, which is expected to be completed by mid-September, would catapult the combination of Publicis and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi into the top tier of mega-firms.</p>
        <p>The Publicis Groupe will rank fifth in billings, at $17.8 billion, and revenue, at $2.2 billion, behind Havas, the Interpublic Group of Companies, the Omnicom Group and WPP.</p>
        <p>''We're a powerful new force in worldwide advertising, vaulting to No. 5 overnight,'' said Bob Seelert, the chairman of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, who joined Mr. Levy for the telephone interview.</p>
        <p>''We're doing business in a consolidating world,'' said Mr. Seelert, who will retain his title when Saatchi &amp; Saatchi becomes a unit of the Publicis Groupe. ''And this puts us up in the premier league.''</p>
        <p>Asked whether he was worried about Saatchi &amp; Saatchi losing its identity with its independence, Mr. Seelert replied: ''Quite the contrary. Saatchi &amp; Saatchi is a brand name to be cultivated.''</p>
        <p>Along with Mr. Seelert, all of the top advertising executives at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi have agreed to stay, he and Mr. Levy said, including Kevin Roberts, its chief executive. Mr. Seelert will join the supervisory board of the new Publicis Groupe and Mr. Roberts will join the management board.</p>
        <p>By maintaining Saatchi &amp; Saatchi as an autonomous agency separate from those Publicis now owns, Mr. Levy and Mr. Seelert said, they had assuaged the fears of clients concerned about potential conflicts that could have scuttled the deal.</p>
        <p>''Kevin has talked to Procter &amp; Gamble and Toyota,'' Mr. Levy said, naming two principal clients of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi that compete against Publicis clients like L'Oreal and Renault, which controls a Toyota rival, Nissan Motor.</p>
        <p>''And I have spoken personally to the C.E.O.'s of L'Oreal and Renault,'' Mr. Levy said, adding that they were ''very supportive and very enthusiastic and have no problems.''</p>
        <p>Less enthusiastic were investors in Paris, who pummeled Publicis shares almost 12 percent, to 418 euros, or $401. Some advertising industry analysts said they considered the deal overpriced.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, I would have preferred to pay a lower price, but I will never overpay,'' Mr. Levy said. ''The price is fair.''</p>
        <p>''The price is approximately three times Saatchi &amp; Saatchi revenue for 2000, which is in line with what Havas paid for Snyder and what WPP is paying for Y.&amp; R,'' he added. ''And the deal will be accretive to earnings in the first full year.''</p>
        <p>Publicis will pay the equivalent of 500 pence, or $7.56, for each share of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, a premium of 51 percent to the closing price on Friday on the London Stock Exchange. After rising 27 percent on Monday as word of the deal circulated among investors and the advertising industry, shares of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi fell 1.5 pence yesterday, to 419.5 pence, or $6.30.</p>
        <p>In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the American depository receipts of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi fell $1.5625, to $31.50, after increasing 30 percent on Monday in anticipation of the deal. In the negotiations, Publicis was advised by Lazard L.L.C., and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi was advised by UBS Warburg Securities.</p>
        <p>The fine print of the deal is almost as long as that found at the bottom of an ad promoting a bargain lease on a Renault or Toyota. Approvals must be obtained from shareholders of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and Publicis at two special meetings in August and from a British court to change corporate rules. Shareholders of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi are to own 30 percent of the Publicis Groupe, with shareholders of Publicis getting the rest.</p>
        <p>Shares and American depository receipts of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi will cease trading in London and New York and will be replaced by shares and A.D.R.'s of the Publicis Groupe traded in Paris and New York. And there will be changes in the direct and indirect ownership rights to Publicis, controlled by the family of Marcel Bleustein-Blanchet, the mentor of Mr. Levy who founded the agency in 1926, with the creation of 3.4 million to 4.5 million shares of what will be the Publicis Groupe.</p>
        <p>In a twist worthy of an episode of ''Bewitched,'' in which Samantha's mother plays tricks on her son-in-law's advertising agency, Mr. Levy's relationship with Saatchi &amp; Saatchi will come in addition to his relationship with M &amp; C Saatchi, the London agency founded by the Saatchi brothers after they stormed out of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi in 1994 in the wake of a bitter dispute with American investors and the board there.</p>
        <p>When M &amp; C Saatchi wrested the plum British Airways account from Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, Mr. Levy volunteered to handle the assignment in countries outside of Europe and North America where the Saatchis' shop had no offices. That alliance will continue between the Publicis unit of the new Publicis Groupe and M &amp; C Saatchi.</p>
        <p>''I called him this morning to share the news,'' Mr. Levy said of Maurice Saatchi, ''and he told me he is very happy to see the Saatchi &amp; Saatchi name is in a safe home.'' There has been speculation that Maurice Saatchi has toyed from time to time with making a bid for Saatchi &amp; Saatchi.</p>
        <p>''I've never met Maurice Saatchi,'' said Mr. Seelert, who joined Saatchi &amp; Saatchi after the brothers departed, ''but I think we've got radically different people, a Maurice,'' which he pronounced the French way, MORE-reese, ''as opposed to a Maurice,'' which he pronounced the British way, MORR-iss.</p>
