        <p>Riding the subway from his air-conditioned Upper East Side hotel to the dirty, noisy Brook Avenue stop in the Bronx, Jonathan Kozol breathed easier, in spite of his asthma.</p>
        <p>He stopped worrying about his book tour, stopped agonizing over the morality of school vouchers: ''Could vouchers be used for David Dukes schools? Or dislike-Jews schools?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kozol, who has been studying the schools and children of poor inner-city neighborhoods for more than 30 years, is famous for his first book, ''Death at an Early Age''; published in 1967, it was a scathing account of how schools in Boston cheated poor black children out of a decent education. That book and his later ones, about poverty and homelessness and illiteracy, have made him something of an icon among educators.</p>
        <p>Seven years ago, he came to the South Bronx, intending to write a crusading book about asthma.</p>
        <p>Instead, he took an intimate look at the lives of children in a poor neighborhood, as they spent time at their public schools and at an after-school program run by St. Ann's Church in Mott Haven. The result was his latest book, ''Ordinary Resurrections: Children in the Years of Hope.''</p>
        <p>In the book, Mr. Kozol focuses, with wide-eyed wonderment, on small things: a child's artwork, a dog partial to rice and beans, his 8-year-old heroine, Pineapple, fixing him a glass of Kool-Aid.</p>
        <p>''The political implications of the book may be stronger than any book I've done,'' he said, ''because you get to know children in considerable detail. Good God, with all these gifts, useful energy, innocence, curiosity, why don't we give them everything we have? At least I hope readers will ask that.''</p>
        <p>As the No. 6 train rocked into Mott Haven, Mr. Kozol unclenched his arms from his chest and took on the demeanor of proud parent.</p>
        <p>He arrives at one school he has studied, Public School 30 -- a school he admires: the children are happy, the principal charismatic and the teachers loyal. He doesn't try to explain why it performs poorly on reading and math tests. He finds gleaming floors, kindly teachers, children playing clarinets and a life-size photograph of Matisse painting in his Paris studio.</p>
        <p>Aida Rosa, the gregarious red-headed principal, dispenses back-rubs and ''un besito'' to everyone.  She passes two pretty young women with long black hair, who want to be teachers. Mr. Kozol recognizes Joseph Medina, who has grown from a first grader into a fourth grader. ''Remember that book, 'The Little Prince,' '' Mr. Kozol asks. ''Yes,'' Joseph replies. ''I still read that book sometimes before I go to sleep. I like the part where the boa constrictor swallows the elephant.''</p>
        <p>The little girl who appears in Mr. Kozol's book as Pineapple attends  P.S. 65, the other school in the neighborhood, which has test scores just a few percentage points below those at P.S. 30.</p>
        <p>Pineapple said that last year, in fourth grade, she had four teachers.</p>
        <p>Yolanda Benjamin, whose daughter Brittney is pictured on the cover of Mr. Kozol's book, also attends P.S. 65. Ms. Benjamin complains that the children are allowed to go to the bathroom only twice a day. Ms. Benjamin was docked half a day's pay, she said, because she had to leave work to pick up Brittney when she had ''an accident.''</p>
        <p>''She was all wet,'' Ms. Benjamin recalled.</p>
        <p>After school on this day, Pineapple walks Mr. Kozol back to the subway station. Mr. Kozol buys her an icy treat, and another for himself, to keep from feeling faint in the afternoon heat. ''Jonathan treats me like a daughter,'' Pineapple says. ''I like that.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kozol returns the compliment. ''I find her a joy to be with,'' he said, on the subway back to his hotel. He hopes to send her to a New England prep school. ''I suspect,'' he predicted, ''that she will have a glorious life.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kozol also admires the Rev. Martha Overall -- known as Mother Martha -- the pastor of St. Ann's Church, for her devotion to a tough neighborhood and the work the parish does for the children. And he identifies with her. He graduated from Harvard in 1958. She graduated from Radcliffe in 1969. ''I didn't expect to walk into a church in Mott Haven,'' Mr. Kozol said, ''and find a priest who had the same professors I had in Cambridge.''</p>
        <p>By his own account, Mr. Kozol has mellowed. His heroes are Robert Coles, the child psychiatrist, whom Mr. Kozol first met at Harvard, and Fred Rogers, the Mr. Rogers of children's television.</p>
        <p>''I like Robert Coles's tentativeness,'' Mr. Kozol said. ''It's something I admire very much also in Fred Rogers. I've been drawn to people who recognize the limits of certainty and do not speak in absolutes and who spend more time listening than making pronouncements.''</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Kozol has sometimes been chided for seeing things in black and white. His career as a social critic began at the age of 30, when he spent a year as a fourth-grade teacher in Roxbury, and was fired for reading a poem by Langston Hughes. The charge, he said, was ''curricular deviation.''</p>
        <p>It was just after the summer of '64, the height of the civil rights movement. It was the year he described in ''Death at an Early Age,'' and Mr. Kozol remembers it as the happiest year of his life.</p>
        <p>As an undergraduate at Harvard, he said, ''I felt pressure to be urbane, ironic, sophisticated and faintly Brittanic.'' But that summer in Roxbury, ''I felt I was completely myself.''</p>
        <p>Some of Mr. Kozol's critics say the context of his work may be muddled.The Rev. Robert Jeffers, the chaplain of Bronx Lebanon Hospital, complains that Mr. Kozol still sees the South Bronx as the devastated place it was 20 years ago, ignoring huge strides by community and church coalitions to build new housing, fight crime and improve the schools.</p>
        <p>''I just get so upset with him,'' said Father Jeffers, who has lived and worked in the South Bronx since 1969. ''There are people who are very concerned, things that are happening. It seems to me that a man of his stature could draw attention to that. There has to be a balance.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kozol dismisses the criticism as misguided. The book gets its strength, he said, from its intimacy and abstention from polemics.</p>
        <p>It is, he said, a mirror image of that long-ago first book.</p>
        <p>''I still like that book,'' he said of ''Death at an Early Age.''</p>
        <p>''I meet an awful lot of teachers who say they decided to become teachers after reading it, and I'm glad of that. I certainly wouldn't disown it. It's just that the title is inaccurate. Looking back now with the benefit of years, I don't think children die as easily as some of us used to think.''</p>
