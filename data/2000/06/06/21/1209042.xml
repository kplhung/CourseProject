        <p>Playing through Milt Jackson's tune ''Sandra's Blues'' on Monday night, one of many pieces he wrote for his wife, the vibraphonist Steve Nelson underscored Jackson's greatest qualities: his economy, his swing, and his directness. Jackson, who died this year at 76, was a master at building sophisticated castles out of the blues. And though he was a peerless vibraphone player, his sense of narrative pacing and the clear statement may have come from his early experience as a gospel singer.</p>
        <p>The pianist Mike LeDonne organized Monday's tribute concert at Symphony Space, part of the JVC Jazz Festival; he was part of the rhythm section, with the bassist Bob Cranshaw and the drummer Mickey Roker. The first half focused on Jackson's own tunes, and the second was a free-ranging homage in which musicians simply did what they did best in the memory of their friend.</p>
        <p>The evening was full of moments when jazz musicians -- singers and instrumentalists both -- gave up part of the battle of high-concept group playing, became serene inside and gave way to the impulse of song. The trumpeter Jon Faddis, one of jazz's daredevil players, played subtly and slowly all night, working up gradually to his brief high-note climaxes. The saxophonist Stanley Turrentine, whose instrumental voice -- much like Jackson's -- is a combination of a sophisticated blues singer and a bebopper, played warmly and beautifully on ''S. K. J.''</p>
        <p>Jimmy Heath, the evening's senior performer, first played with Milt Jackson in 1948 but comes from another harmonic place entirely, closer to John Coltrane than to Charlie Parker. Mr. Heath played both soprano and tenor saxophone in two halves of Thelonious Monk's ''Round Midnight.'' Etta Jones sang two of her specialties, ''Lady Be Good'' and ''You've Changed.'' She was taking her time, wavering the pitch of her long notes between flat and true, while Mr. Turrentine delicately shadowed her with obbligatos.</p>
        <p>But amid all these direct references to Jackson's art -- his compositions, blues upon blues, Mr. Nelson's vibraphone playing -- possibly the most touching was a brief performance by the pianist John Lewis, Jackson's longtime colleague in the Modern Jazz Quartet. He told the audience he had spent more of his life with Jackson than he had with some members of his own family.</p>
        <p>He played two piano solos, ''Sweet Georgia Brown'' and ''Django,'' and they were bereavement itself: spare, light in their left-hand chords, rather classical but moving among rubato, a slow stride and quietly driving, even four-beat sections. They were careful, serious, and profound little performances and over in a flash.</p>
