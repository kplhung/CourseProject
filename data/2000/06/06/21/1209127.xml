        <p>BUSH TOPS $90 MILLION MARK -- Gov. George W. Bush's presidential campaign continues to shatter fund-raising records, topping the $90 million mark when receipts for May are included. But most of the money has already been spent and the Texas governor continues to beat the bushes for more. Campaign officials announced yesterday that Mr. Bush raised $6 million in May and spent $4.9 million, leaving him with $7.1 million in the bank. Vice President Al Gore reported that he had raised only $587,802 in May, and had spent $1.3 million. He was left with $8.2 million, out of $37 million raised over all during the campaign. Mr. Gore expects to qualify for $15 million in federal matching funds, bringing his total preconvention fund to the $40.5 million spending cap placed on candidates who accept federal money. Mr. Bush, who is not accepting federal money, expects to spend nearly twice as much before the Republican National Convention, which starts on July 31. After the conventions, candidates must stop fund-raising and will be given $67.6 million in federal funds to spend on the general election.</p>

        <p>LABOR ZEROS IN ON BUSH -- The A.F.L.-C.I.O. has issued a warning to Gov. George W. Bush: ''The Texas Truth Squad is coming.'' The truth squad, composed of workers from Texas, will appear at labor-sponsored meetings around the country and will try to sully Mr. Bush's reputation by talking about problems in Texas that include education, health care and the treatment of farm workers. The union leaflet says the truth squad will note that Texas ranks the lowest among all states in the percentage of people who have health insurance and near the bottom in College Board scores. John J. Sweeney, president of the labor federation, will be the master of ceremonies at the first truth squad event, to be held in Philadelphia on June 29. Union officials say similar events will be held in Albuquerque, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Los Angeles, Louisville, Ky., and Miami. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. has endorsed Vice President Al Gore.</p>

        <p>THE REFORM PARTY</p>
        <p>PHYSICIST CHALLENGES BUCHANAN -- John Hagelin, the quantum physicist who founded the Natural Law Party, challenged Patrick J. Buchanan yesterday for the Reform Party's presidential nomination and the right to spend the party's $12.6 million in federal campaign money. In addition to running as the nominee of the Natural Law Party, whose platform emphasizes ''harnessing the managing intelligence of nature,'' Mr. Hagelin said he had qualified to have his name placed on the mail ballot that Reform Party members will use to pick a nominee. He predicted that he would get more mail votes than Mr. Buchanan, widely regarded as the favorite in the contest. If that happens, he said, Mr. Buchanan's only hope to become the nominee would be to pull off a coup at the party's national convention in Long Beach, Calif., this summer. Ever since Mr. Buchanan left the Republican Party last year he has been taking over the Reform Party, winning the biggest share of convention delegates chosen at state party meetings. Party rules say a two-thirds majority at the national convention can overturn the result of mail-in balloting.</p>

        <p>THE STATES</p>
        <p>GORE LEADS IN CALIFORNIA POLL -- Gov. George W. Bush says he intends to compete all out with Vice President Al Gore in California, which, with 54 electoral votes, is the mother lode of presidential politics. But a new Golden State Poll has Mr. Gore leading Mr. Bush by the biggest margin ever, 11 points. The poll, made public yesterday by the Field organization, one of California's most respected survey groups, has Mr. Gore ahead, 46 percent to 35 percent, despite frequent appearances in the state by Mr. Bush and a strong showing by Ralph Nader, the Green Party contender. Mr. Nader was supported by 7 percent of those questioned, with about half saying they would otherwise back Mr. Gore. Patrick J. Buchanan, the Reform Party contender, drew 2 percent. Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore were locked in a statistical tie in California until early this year, but the vice president opened a seven-point edge in February and steadily widened it since then. He holds commanding leads among voters in California's two principal population centers, Los Angeles County and the San Francisco Bay Area. Mr. Bush holds a slim lead in heavily Republican Southern California, outside Los Angeles, and a 12-point lead in Northern California, outside the Bay Area. The poll, conducted from June 9 to 18, surveyed 642 people whom it considered likely to vote, and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.</p>

        <p>THE DEMOCRATS</p>
        <p>AD CAMPAIGN AIMS AT MINORITIES -- Democratic Party officials announced yesterday the start  of a radio and television advertising campaign intended to appeal specifically to African-American and Hispanic voters. Vice President Al Gore's health care proposals, including a patients' bill of rights plan, are the focus of advertisements intended for African-Americans. The commercials for Hispanic voters, which are in Spanish, touch on education and preserving Social Security and other issues. ''Al Gore and the Democrats,'' the announcer says in Spanish. ''We can count on them.'' The African-American advertisements will be broadcast in 17 states, while the advertisements for Hispanics will be shown only in Florida, Illinois, New Mexico and Wisconsin.</p>
