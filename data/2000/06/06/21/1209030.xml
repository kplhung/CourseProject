        <p>WHAT does crispness look like?</p>
        <p>How's this: a  thin cookie-like confection, about five inches across, with handsomely browned edges and glossy, crackling patches of caramelized sugar. This Spanish olive oil biscuit, sold at the new Oliviers &amp; Company shop in Grand Central Terminal, fairly snapped as I broke off a piece, releasing the sweet, captivating evergreen scent of aniseeds. I nibbled away, tasting licorice and burnt sugar enriched with fruity olive oil on a delicately wheaty base.</p>

        <p>WHAT does crispness look like?</p>
        <p>How's this: a  thin cookie-like confection, about five inches across, with handsomely browned edges and glossy, crackling patches of caramelized sugar. This Spanish olive oil biscuit, sold at the new Oliviers &amp; Company shop in Grand Central Terminal, fairly snapped as I broke off a piece, releasing the sweet, captivating evergreen scent of aniseeds. I nibbled away, tasting licorice and burnt sugar enriched with fruity olive oil on a delicately wheaty base.</p>
        <p>These rustic biscuits are handmade and wood grilled, as they have been for 150 years, in Andalusia, the region of Spain whose hillsides and valleys are gray-green with olive trees as far as the eye can see.</p>
        <p>There, the biscuits are eaten at breakfast or teatime. But I prefer them after dinner. They have it all over fancy petits fours and chocolate truffles.</p>
        <p>The biscuits are fabulous served with fruit, ice cream or sorbet, or with coffee or a glass of brandy.</p>
        <p>FLORENCE FABRICANT</p>
        <p>Spanish sweet olive oil biscuits are sold in packages of five for $9.50 at Oliviers &amp; Company, Grand Central Terminal, in the Graybar Passage opposite Track 17; (212) 696-9438.</p>
