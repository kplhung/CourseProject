        <p>Throwing the Israeli political system into an even greater frenzy than usual, the linchpin Shas political party quit Prime Minister Ehud Barak's governing coalition today. But its resignation does not take effect for 48 hours, which leaves plenty of bargaining time before Mr. Barak loses his parliamentary majority.</p>
        <p>If the strictly religious Shas Party does leave, it will not only reduce Mr. Barak to a minority government but also jeopardize his peacemaking plans with the Palestinians. He needs Shas's support to get a peace deal smoothly approved by a sizable majority of the Parliament and in a popular referendum.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak said tonight that after a week of intensive, sometimes round-the-clock negotiations, he and Shas had worked out the major part of an agreement. And Shas politicians, in turn, made it clear that if an effort was made to address their remaining concerns, their resignations could well be withdrawn.</p>
        <p>''This is definitely an escalation,'' Eli Suissa, one of Shas's four Cabinet members, said after submitting his resignation as infrastructure minister today. ''But the ball is now in the prime minister's court.''</p>
        <p>Exercising their raw power at a time when Mr. Barak considers a peace deal to be his singular goal, the leaders of Shas -- an ultra-Orthodox party that doubles as a kind of ethnic pride movement for Jews of Middle Eastern and North African descent -- are playing a very public game of hardball in their quest to be treated with respect and compensated for their indispensable support. Chiefly, they have been demanding debt relief and tax forgiveness for their  school system as well as the legalization of their pirate radio stations.</p>
        <p>But their gambit could backfire. Mr. Barak's associates said today that he was fed up and contemplating the advantages of reshaping his government without Shas. While such statements are meant to pressure Shas, they probably do reflect Mr. Barak's thinking, too.</p>
        <p>In a news conference this evening, Mr. Barak called the situation a ''crisis that tests the norms of government and Israeli democracy.''</p>
        <p>It also, he suggested, tests his patience, but he repeated his commitment to a broad government including Shas, which he called an ''important party.''</p>
        <p>''My associates and I made a para mount effort to keep Shas in the coalition,'' Mr. Barak said. ''Ninety percent of the problems have been solved. We would like to see Shas stay, but we will respect its decision.''</p>
        <p>Shas's latest maneuver comes at a sensitive time in the Israeli-Palestinian relationship, when both sides are navigating toward what could be the endgame of their seven years of peace negotiations.</p>
        <p>The Palestinians have viewed the chaos in the Israeli government partly with suspicion and partly with concern. On the one hand, they suspect that Mr. Barak will use his political problems as an excuse to delay peace moves. On the other, they worry that they no longer have a partner strong enough to make a good deal and sell it to his public.</p>
        <p>Still, they have displayed a willingness to step back. Senior Palestinian officials said today that they would not press the Israelis to stick to a Friday deadline for the next withdrawal from the West Bank. In the midst of Mr. Barak's political troubles, a land transfer would have proved all but impossible.</p>
        <p>The Palestinians said that Yasir Arafat, their leader, was acceding to a request presented him by President Clinton in Washington last week.</p>
        <p>''We agreed to postpone the implementation for two weeks to examine the possibility of reaching a final agreement,'' Ahmed Qurei, speaker of the Palestinian legislature and the senior Palestinian negotiator, told Voice of Palestine Radio.</p>
        <p>Eager to speedily push things forward, the Israeli government is trying its own full-court press to convince the Americans to convene a retreat-style Israeli-Palestinian peace summit in the United States, proposing July 5 as a start date. American officials said a decision was unlikely to be made before Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright returns to the Mideast next week.</p>
        <p>By that time, the political crisis is likely to have been resolved.</p>
        <p>It has been an intense week of bartering. Mr. Barak and his political negotiators have largely met Shas's demands for money. They have also promised that the recovery plan for its school system would be overseen by the prime minister's office and not by the leftist education minister, Yossi Sarid, who is the Shas Party's nemesis. Mr. Sarid has volunteered to resign his post, if need be, but remain in the government to support the peace effort.</p>
        <p>Nissim Dahan, a Shas lawmaker and the deputy finance minister, complained that in return for what Mr. Barak was offering, he was demanding Shas's support in advance for every future peacemaking move of the government.</p>
        <p>''They are extorting us in the diplomatic, political sphere,'' he said.  ''Even if he wants to transfer Tel Aviv to the Palestinians, we would have to vote yes.''</p>
        <p>Shas's leaders have been upset that they themselves have been portrayed as extortionists and that so many political analysts have predicted that Shas will never give up the perquisites of power. Today, in fact, Eli Yishai, the party's leader, suggested that the resignation letters were meant to prove wrong those who doubted their resolve.</p>
        <p>''Our reasons are not personal ones,'' he said. ''Everyone always said -- give them money, they're incapable of leaving the coalition, they're bound to the money, to the power, to the Volvo,'' the car that every minister gets.</p>
