        <p>A day after the Los Angeles Lakers brought this often jaded city to its feet by storming to the National Basketball Association championship, the mayor and other embarrassed city officials were grilled over a spasm of post-game violence that left two police cruisers burned and four officers injured.</p>
        <p>Roving mobs that grew to several thousand people outside the Staples Center, in downtown Los Angeles, where the Lakers won the championship, burned and destroyed the cruisers, plus one other automobile, and they made bonfires of souvenir T-shirts and posters. They vandalized businesses and battered and nearly upended a television broadcast van before police on foot and on horseback brought them under control, finally allowing the roughly 20,000 fans inside the arena to exit. There were 11 arrests, the police said.</p>
        <p>Mayor Richard J. Riordan said the police did a good job of containing the violence to the vicinity of Staples Center. But what made the issue particularly sensitive, and led to the questions from City Council members at today's meeting, is the growing nervousness here over security for the Democratic convention, less than two months away.</p>
        <p>The council today refused to vote for a Democratic Party request for $6 million in city support of the convention, scheduled to begin on Aug. 14. Although the party had said the convention would be financed with private funds, council members agreed to provide $2 million in bus service and other support but refused to hand over $4 million in cash, insisting on more information before granting the money.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Riordan and other officials, including the police chief, Bernard C. Parks, played down the violence and the threat to the city.</p>
        <p>''Last night, we all witnessed pride and shame, winners and losers,'' the mayor said at a news conference. But he called the police response ''outstanding'' and commented, ''I think the police acted very responsibly, with restraint.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Parks added, ''I think that what we saw yesterday was a very disciplined effort by the Police Department. Certainly that property damage can be replaced. We certainly feel as though the end result was the best that we could do under those circumstances.''</p>
        <p>But some council members said the destruction of so much property, and particularly the open hostility some of those in the melee showed toward the police, was not a small matter and added to concerns about what sort of violence might accompany the Democratic convention.</p>
