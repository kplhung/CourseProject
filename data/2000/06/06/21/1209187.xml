        <p>Some are active Republicans, their offices decorated with stuffed elephants or pictures of Gov. George W. Bush. Many have some sort of experience in law enforcement. These include a former Secret Service agent, a former prosecutor and several former parole workers. But there is also a psychologist, a rancher and a former schoolteacher.</p>
        <p>These men and women are members of the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, the obscure state agency whose job is to review the clemency petitions of inmates in what is by far the nation's busiest death row. When Gov. Bush is asked about the fairness of the death penalty in Texas, he often says that the power to grant clemency to death row inmates rests not with him, but with this 18-member board. Under state law he can commute a death penalty only if the board recommends it.</p>
        <p>But while Mr. Bush has made a point of distancing himself from the board's decisions in capital cases, as governor he has appointed all of its members to their six-year terms. He has also selected the chairman and designated the six members who set policy and guidelines, all subject to approval by the State Senate.</p>
        <p>Now the board is faced with its latest high-profile decision. Unless it intervenes, Gary Graham, a convicted murderer whose case has drawn national attention largely because of accounts of poor work by his lawyer, will be executed at 6 p.m. Thursday.</p>
        <p>In an unusual move, the chairman of the board has postponed the deadline for the vote until noon Thursday, six hours before the scheduled execution. If history is any measure, Mr. Graham's lawyers face an uphill struggle. Since 1995, 68 death row inmates have asked for clemency, and only once has the board granted it. The board has not held a public hearing on a capital case since 1992.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the board has been criticized for working in secret, seldom explaining its life-and-death decisions.</p>
        <p>Adele Shank, an Ohio lawyer specializing in capital defense who argued a landmark clemency case before the United States Supreme Court in 1997, said the Texas board was out of step with the decades-long trend toward greater openness in handling capital clemency decisions. Many state boards require public hearings if requested in capital cases, she said.</p>
        <p>The Texas board has also been accused by defense lawyers of not giving a thorough review to the death row cases it is responsible for evaluating.</p>
        <p>A majority vote is required for any form of clemency. Once the board's votes are all in -- they generally send them in to the main office in Austin by fax -- the decision is immediately relayed to the governor. Board members are not required to meet publicly on capital cases, or even to hold telephone conference calls -- and the apparent lack of such discussion on any sort of systematic basis has prompted criticism from defense lawyers as well as judges.</p>
        <p>But with Mr. Graham's lawyers trying to make a powerful case for his innocence in the 1981 robbery-murder for which he was sentenced to death, there has been an unusual amount of conferring among members about his case, said one board official who asked not to be quoted by name. ''There's an awful lot of talking going on,'' the official said. ''They're concerned about him being possibly innocent. And they're concerned about the lack of an adequate defense.''</p>
        <p>Michael Jones, a spokesman for the governor's office, said Mr. Bush did not personally interview any of the candidates for the paroles board, noting that the governor controlled  3,000 appointments. He said candidates usually apply to the governor's appointment office, which asks a variety of questions, inquiring about a person's views on crime and punishment. But Mr. Jones says none of the candidates are asked their views about the death penalty, nor about their political party affiliation.</p>
        <p>'''Capital murder cases are a very small percentage of the caseload,'' Mr. Jones said in an interview today. ''The goal is to select people who are balanced, fair, thorough and who make decisions based on facts and who have no agenda except to protect the public.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jones said one goal in choosing members ''is to get a diverse perspective,'' and the board is diverse in  ethnicity and geographic representation. But none of the members are criminal defense lawyers. In fact, at least five of the members once worked for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, the same department charged with carrying out executions.</p>
        <p>Interviews with present and former officials indicate that most, if not all, of the board members seem to support the death penalty. One member who left in the last year, Bennie Elmore, abstained in all capital cases, though he declined to say why.</p>
        <p>Kent A. Schaffer, immediate past president of the Texas Criminal Defense Lawyers Association, said all Texas governors carefully selected  board members who could serve as a fire wall when a particularly sensitive case arose.</p>
        <p>''They are predisposed to protect the governor,'' Mr. Schaffer said. ''The governor makes appointments to the board with people he knows can take the heat. He's in the enviable position of saying, 'I can only do what they allow me to do.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said the board acted independently, but some lawyers here believe that governors have ways of making their feelings known to a board made up of people who are beholden to them for their $80,000-a-year jobs.</p>
        <p>''You can be sure there are ways of communicating with the board and letting them know what the governor wants,'' said Neil McCabe, a law professor at South Texas College of Law. Mr. McCabe and others pointed to the case of Henry Lee Lucas, the only one in which the board granted clemency. Ten days before the vote, Mr. Bush said he and the board would have to give careful consideration to the case.</p>
        <p>But five board members interviewed in April said they regarded themselves as independent.</p>
        <p>''There's no communication between us and Governor Bush on how to vote,'' said Linda Garcia, the former prosecutor on the board. ''There just flat isn't.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has said that when he reviews scheduled executions, he considers two questions: whether the inmate is innocent, and whether the inmate received full access to the courts. While there are no clear guidelines on how the board's clemency decisions in capital cases are made, several board members who discussed their review of capital cases in interviews with The New York Times in April said they also focused on those questions.</p>
        <p>''The issue of innocence and guilt is something that I've always looked at very closely,'' said Cynthia Tauss, who has studied criminal justice.</p>
        <p>Another board member, Tom Moss, a retired federal parole officer, said he asked these questions: ''Have they had their day in court? Is there anything in front of me to lead a rational person to believe that this person might be innocent?''</p>
        <p>In 1998, two death row inmates filed a federal lawsuit against the pardons board, criticizing the board's secrecy and failure to explain its reasons for denying clemencies, in most cases. Judge Sam Sparks, of Federal District Court in Austin, found that the Texas clemency system met ''the minimal procedural safeguards'' required by the  Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>But he criticized the process, writing: ''Administratively the goal is more to protect the secrecy and autonomy of the system rather than carrying out an efficient legally sound system. The board would not have to sacrifice its conservative ideology to carry out its duties in a more fair and accurate fashion.''</p>
        <p>At the time the case was pending, legislation had been introduced in Texas that would require the board to consider clemency appeals in public meetings. Mr. Bush resisted the changes. He said public deliberations might create ''a chance for people to rant and rail, a chance for people to emotionalize the process beyond the questions that need to be asked.'' The bill died in the legislative session.</p>
        <p>In capital clemency cases, both the prosecution and the defense are free to submit material. Board members said they also regularly received letters from relatives of both the victims and the inmates.</p>
        <p>The material in the Graham case is voluminous and fills several notebooks, said the board's general counsel, Laura McElroy. In their clemency petition, Mr. Graham's defense lawyers, Jack B. Zimmermann and Richard H. Burr, contend that Mr. Graham is innocent of the robbery murder for which he was convicted in 1981. The lawyers also presented videotapes of two eyewitnesses who say they saw the killer, and that he was not Mr. Graham.</p>
        <p>On Friday, Mr. Zimmermann and Mr. Burr met with the board chairman, Gerald Garrett, and presented additional information, including affidavits from two jurors who said that if they had heard the new eyewitness testimony during the trial, they would have voted to acquit Mr. Graham, Mr. Zimmermann said.</p>
        <p>The defense also included in its new submission a videotape of Jennifer Thompson, a North Carolina woman who talks about the remorse she feels about misidentifying the man who raped her, and thus sending the wrong man to prison. (He was released after 11 years because of DNA evidence that showed he did not rape Ms. Thompson.)</p>
        <p>A jury sentenced Mr. Graham to death based on the testimony of a single eyewitness, who said she saw him through the windshield of her car, from 30 to 40 feet away at night, and fleetingly. That witness has stuck to her account.</p>
        <p>The board has also received a 10-page letter from John B. Holmes Jr., the Harris County district attorney, whose office prosecuted Mr. Graham, stating his strong opposition to any form of executive clemency for Mr. Graham. In addition to emphasizing his certitude about Mr. Graham's guilt, Mr. Holmes lists the 10 aggravated robberies to which Mr. Graham pleaded guilty.</p>
        <p>The board members interviewed by The Times said they reviewed cases scrupulously, poring over documents and videotapes. ''We are their last chance,'' said Daniel Lang, a board member and lawyer. ''It's somebody's life. I think they're entitled to my full concentration.''</p>
        <p>While it is their rulings in capital cases that have thrust the board into  the spotlight, they spend most of their time making about 1,000 decisions a month on parole for state inmates, decisions that mostly involve robberies and drug possession.</p>
        <p>Paddy Lann Burwell, the rancher on the board, says he spends 50 hours a week on the job, eating lunch at his desk, and taking cases home to give them further consideration at night.</p>
        <p>''The worst nightmare would be to execute an innocent person,'' he said.</p>
