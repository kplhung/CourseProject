        <p>LAKE GEORGE: MRS. CLINTON DEMURS  In February, when Hillary Rodham Clinton was considering a Senate race against Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, she exuberantly suggested that she and the mayor crisscross the state, debating where they stopped. But when she was asked yesterday if she would favor marathon debates with Mr. Giuliani's replacement, Representative Rick A. Lazio, she was noncommittal. She said she had already accepted two debates. Had her views changed with Mr. Giuliani out of the race? Joseph Reilly, the president of the broadcasters group, pulled Mrs. Clinton away before she could answer.</p>

        <p>BROOKLYN: LOUIMA SENTENCING ARGUMENTS  Prosecutors said yesterday that the three police officers convicted in March of covering up the assault on Abner Louima, left, should be denied most of the sentencing reductions they requested. The officers -- Charles Schwarz, Thomas Bruder and Thomas Wiese -- are scheduled to be sentenced by Judge Eugene H. Nickerson in Federal District Court in Brooklyn on Tuesday. Federal prosecutors said the officers did not deserve lighter sentences for doing such things as helping Mr. Louima retrieve his shoe after the attack.</p>

        <p>BROOKLYN: DOMINO SUGAR PROTEST  The International Longshoremen's Association, which has been on strike for more than a year against the Domino Sugar refinery in Brooklyn, will hold a rally tomorrow at the British Consulate in Manhattan to put pressure on Domino's British-owned parent, Tate &amp; Lyle. Union officials say they hope the demonstration will highlight the boycott of Domino and Tate &amp; Lyle and help pressure management to reach a settlement. Management has sought to lay off 100 workers.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: TIMES SQUARE KILLING  A man was fatally stabbed in Midtown Manhattan yesterday after a dispute with two other men, the authorities said. The victim, whose name was withheld pending notification of his family, was found on the sidewalk at 4:20 a.m. near the intersection of Eighth Avenue and 42nd Street, dressed in women's clothing and stabbed once in the neck, the police said. He was taken to St. Vincents Hospital, where he died. The police arrested Eugene Celestine, 26, of Queens and were reviewing charges against him last night.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: HATE CRIMES  State Senator David A. Paterson of Manhattan said yesterday that the June 11 Central Park melee was a model for prosecution under pending hate crimes legislation. ''The appalling assaults that occurred following the Puerto Rican Day Parade in Central Park meet the test,'' he told reporters. The Senate approved amendments to broaden the state's hate crimes law this month, and an Assembly vote is expected this week.</p>

        <p>WASHINGTON: DEMOCRATIC RADIO ADS  The State Democratic Party will begin broadcasting radio advertisements today condemning a Republican group's attack on Representative Michael P. Forbes of Suffolk County, who switched parties to become a Democrat. The Republican Majority Issues Campaign last week put up 50 electronic billboards outside convenience stores on Long Island showing Mr. Forbes with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. The Democratic rebuttal ads are expected to run for several weeks.</p>

        <p>STAMFORD: LIFE SENTENCE FOR BOY'S KILLER  Russell Peeler Jr., 28, of Bridgeport will be sentenced to a minimum of life in prison without parole in the killing of an 8-year-old boy and his mother last year. A Superior Court jury could not reach the unanimous decision required by state law to invoke the death penalty. Mr. Peeler was found guilty of ordering the killing of Leroy Brown Jr. and his mother, Karen Clarke. Mr. Peeler had been found guilty in the killing of Ms. Clarke's fiance, Rudolph Snead Jr., and Leroy was to be the state's crucial witness.</p>

        <p>CAMDEN: NEW CHARGE AGAINST RABBI  Fred Neulander, the Cherry Hill rabbi awaiting trial on charges that he arranged the slaying of his wife, has been indicted on the additional charge of capital murder. A Camden County jury added the charge against Mr. Neulander after hearing new evidence. The rabbi's wife, Carol, was bludgeoned to death in their home more than five years ago. Two men have pleaded guilty to the crime, saying Mr. Neulander wanted his wife dead so he could continue his affair with another woman.</p>

        <p>NEWARK: BRIBE CASE PLEA  A salesman for an office-cleaning company pleaded guilty yesterday to federal tax evasion, admitting he shared bribe money paid to a manager for Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York, or HIP, in exchange for cleaning contracts. The salesman, Kevin Gilmartin, 47, of Oceanport, admitted in United States District Court in Newark that he had not paid income tax on $200,000 he received from among $760,000 in payments to the HIP manager, said Alain Leibman, an assistant United States attorney. The manager has not been charged.</p>

        <p>HACKENSACK: CRASH STUDIED  The Bergen County prosecutor's office said it was awaiting blood tests before determining if negligent driving or a mechanical problem caused the car crash that killed Jeffrey A. Willick, an assistant professor of physics at Stanford University, on Sunday. Dr. Willick, 40, was fatally injured when the car hit a Starbuck's coffee shop. The driver, Joseph A. Santiglia, 53, was charged with driving under the influence because he staggered and his speech was slurred after the crash, said John Higgins, an assistant prosecutor. His blood was to be tested for medication, alcohol and narcotics, Mr. Higgins said.</p>
