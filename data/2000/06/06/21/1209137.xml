      <block class="full_text">
        <p>With strong bipartisan support, the Senate voted today to make hate attacks on gays a federal crime.</p>
        <p>The vote was an unexpectedly wide 57 to 42 and was the first time either house of Congress backed protection of gays in a roll-call vote that could have political consequences.</p>
        <p>The Senate passed a similar measure last year, quietly and by unanimous consent, only to see it killed in a House-Senate conference, and Republican leaders said they planned to kill it in conference again this year.</p>
        <p>But Vice President Al Gore, who flew back from a campaign event to preside and cast a tie-breaking vote if necessary, said that if the House did not pass the measure on its own, the administration would ''of course'' insist that it be included in a major spending bill before Congress could adjourn.</p>
        <p>President Clinton, who was calling senators today and on Monday asking for their votes, has repeatedly used that tactic in recent years, and Republicans have often given in to his insistence that measures he wanted be added to spending bills. Without the additions, he threatened to veto them, and Republicans feared being accused of shutting down the government if he did.</p>
        <p>The bill passed today would expand federal jurisdiction for crimes based on race, religion and national origin, and would also add sex and handicapped status to the categories covered, as well as sexual orientation. But while the issue never came up openly in debate, senators on both sides agreed that the sexual orientation issue was the question that made the bill a close call.</p>
        <p>Senator Gordon H. Smith, a freshman Republican from Oregon who co-sponsored the bill with Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, appealed to those who he said had told him they did not want to vote for the bill and thereby seem to be approving homosexuality.</p>
        <p>''No matter how we pray, nor how we sin, we can stand up for each other,'' Mr. Smith said. ''We can stand up against hate.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kennedy told the Senate, ''Hate crimes are rooted in hatred and bigotry, and if America is ever going to be America, we should root out hatred and bigotry.''</p>
        <p>After the vote he said: ''This was a bipartisan effort. It was the Senate acting at its best, with one voice.''</p>
        <p>Forty-four Democrats and 13 Republicans voted for the bill. Forty-one Republicans and 1 Democrat, Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, opposed it.</p>
        <p>The only senator who spoke against the bill was Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican who heads the Judiciary Committee. Mr. Hatch contended that the measure was unnecessary because hate crimes were already being adequately prosecuted by states and localities, and unconstitutional because it invaded state authority.</p>
        <p>He proposed a narrower bill that would require a study of whether states were ignoring hate crimes.</p>
        <p>''I don't think it is true,'' he said. But if it was, he added, he might support a measure like the Kennedy-Smith bill.</p>
        <p>''Hate crimes are abysmal,'' he said. ''They are horrible. We should all be against them.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hatch's proposal for a study was adopted, 50 to 49.</p>
        <p>But if Mr. Hatch was the only vocal critic, others who voted no made it clear that the protections based on sexual orientation had turned them against the measure. The only previous time when either house has come close to passing a bill protecting gays was in 1996, when a 50-to-49 vote in the Senate defeated a move to prohibit job discrimination based on sexual orientation.</p>
        <p>The Kennedy-Smith bill, like Mr. Hatch's proposal, would authorize federal grants and other assistance to state and local law enforcement officials to prosecute hate crimes.</p>
        <p>It would make a federal offense of crimes involving bodily injury motivated by a victim's actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation or disability. Federal law now prohibits crimes based on race, national origin or religion, but only when the victim was seeking to exercise a federally protected right, like voting, registering for school or using a restaurant.  The bill passed today would also make a federal crime of random hate crimes, like the 1998 murders of James Byrd Jr. in Texas and Matthew Shepard in Wyoming.</p>
        <p>But to reach the Shepard case, and also hate crimes against the handicapped or based on sex, the prosecution would have to establish a direct connection to interstate commerce, though the connection could be no more than use of a gun bought in interstate commerce.</p>
        <p>And before a federal indictment could be obtained, the Justice Department would have to certify that it had consulted with the local authorities, who either had no jurisdiction or intention to act, or that the state had requested or at least did not object to federal action, or that the state had completed prosecution.</p>
        <p>Whatever the fate of the legislation, today's vote propelled the issue into the political campaign. At the presidential level, Mr. Gore's enthusiasm contrasted to the attitude of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. On March 22, 1999, Mr. Bush said he opposed including sexual orientation in a hate-crimes bill the Texas Legislature was considering. When that bill died without a vote, supporters of it blamed him and said his lack of support was dictated by presidential campaign considerations.</p>
        <p>Tonight Mr. Gore embraced the bill eagerly, saying, ''Because hate crimes are an affront to all Americans, this vote is a sign of hope for all Americans.'' He said the next task was to get the House to vote on the measure. But he was asked about the reluctance of Republican leaders, like Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader, who said, ''I don't see that happening.''</p>
        <p>House leaders may come under some quiet pressure from their troops to enable the bill to become law -- just as the New York State Senate, under Republican control, shifted its stance earlier this year and passed such a bill.</p>
        <p>Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, an openly gay Democrat who advocates the Kennedy-Smith bill, said that while the bill could not pass the House right now,  things might change when the elections were closer.</p>
        <p>''Politics can have strange effects on people's views of bedfellowship,'' Mr. Frank said.</p>
