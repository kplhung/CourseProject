        <p>I COULD never decide whether vichyssoise was subtle or simply boring.</p>
        <p>Certainly this cold potato-leek soup has potential. Developed at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in New York in 1917 and named for a French spa, it's a variation on the hot, creamy staple of many French households, a simple soup made of pureed vegetables.</p>
        <p>Traditional cooks, though, never limited their purees to just two mild white vegetables like leeks and potatoes unless they had to. They added other vegetables for flavor and color.</p>
        <p>The recipe for vichyssoise, unfortunately, appears to have been written in stone. It calls for potatoes, leeks, water or stock, salt, pepper, butter and cream. What little complexity the soup has comes from lightly browning the vegetables in the butter and using lots of salt and pepper, good stock and, of course, the cream.</p>
        <p>There is a better way to make vichyssoise, however, that is not only easier and more interesting but also lower in fat: add extra vegetables, just as a French home cook would with soupe bonne femme, the inspiration for vichyssoise.</p>
        <p>The most obvious addition is garlic, and the young, green garlic found in farmers' markets and some supermarkets at this time of year is a wonderful choice, adding distinctive but mellow flavor, as well as color. Use the bulb and some of the green tops. Regular garlic, the cloves left whole, works as well. Carrots contribute a beautiful color and a haunting sweetness to the soup. And you can nudge vichyssoise over toward gazpacho territory by adding a ripe tomato, along with some fresh basil.</p>
        <p>The idea is to be flexible and go with what is available. In any case, the technique is perfectly simple: cook the vegetables in water or stock; then cool, puree and chill them. Browning the vegetables in butter first makes a pleasant but not highly significant difference, so I skip it. Adding cream or half-and-half at the end is nice, but few things are ''creamier'' than pureed potatoes.</p>
        <p>As for the choice between stock and water, if you have good stock -- homemade stock -- by all means use it; it will add a great deal of complexity. But if the option is canned stock or water, this is a place to save your money: use water.</p>
        <p>Vichyssoise is usually served as a first course, but you can make it more of a meal by adding some cold grilled shrimp or just a few croutons. And while the traditional garnish is chives, parsley or chervil adds a little more of a twist.</p>
        <p>VICHYSSOISE WITH GREEN GARLIC  Time: 40 minutes, plus time to chill</p>
        <p>1 pound leeks or onions, or a combination  1 quart water or stock, or a combination  1 pound russet or Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut into slices or chunks  1 whole head green garlic, plus its stem, chopped, or 3 cloves garlic, peeled  Salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
        <p>1/2 to 1 cup heavy cream or half-and-half (optional)  Chopped parsley or chervil for garnish.</p>
        <p>1. Wash leeks or peel onions. Slice or chop.</p>
        <p>2. Combine the water or stock, potatoes, leeks or onions, garlic, salt and pepper in a saucepan. Cover and bring to a boil. Lower the heat so the mixture simmers steadily. Cook until the potatoes are tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Cool or chill. Then season to taste.</p>
        <p>3. Puree in a blender, in batches if necessary, and chill completely. Stir in the cream or half-and-half. Taste, adjust seasoning and serve, garnished with parsley or chervil.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Tomato and Basil Variation: Core 2 medium tomatoes by cutting a cone-shape wedge out of the stem ends. Cut them in half horizontally. Squeeze and shake out the seeds. Cut flesh into chunks. Substitute the tomatoes for the garlic and proceed as above but omit the cream. Add about 20 washed and dried basil leaves when pureeing. To serve, garnish with chopped basil.</p>
        <p>Carrot Variation: Add 4 medium carrots, peeled and chopped, to the pot along with the potatoes and leeks. (Garlic is optional but still good.) Add 1 cup more liquid and proceed as above.</p>
