        <p>Garth H. Drabinsky, the beleaguered impresario behind ''Ragtime'' and other Broadway shows, announced today that he was returning to theatrical production two years after the sale of his troubled company, Livent Inc.</p>
        <p>Mr. Drabinsky, who lives here and is facing fraud charges filed by prosecutors in New York, said at a news conference that he planned to bring a production of ''The Island,'' South African playwright Athol Fugard's apartheid-era play, to Toronto in May. The production has already been staged by the Royal National Theater of London.</p>
        <p>In January 1999 the United States attorney in Manhattan charged Mr. Drabinsky and his partner, Myron I. Gottlieb, with 16 counts of fraud and conspiracy.'' Both men have maintained their innocence. Mr. Drabinsky, who also faces civil suits here and an ongoing investigation by the Canadian authorities, refused to comment on his legal situation. He said that financing for ''The Island'' would be provided by ''a number of splendid friends and individuals.''</p>
        <p>As co-founder of Livent, Mr. Drabinsky produced Broadway shows like ''Ragtime'' and a revival of ''Showboat.'' Saying that virtually all his creative relationships remained intact, Mr. Drabinsky said he planned to produce more plays, including the big-budget musicals he specialized in at Livent.</p>
        <p>When she filed 16 felony counts of fraud and conspiracy against Mr. Drabinsky and Mr. Gottlieb in January, Mary Jo White, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said that if they did not turn themselves in, United States prosecutors would quickly file papers in Canadian courts to extradite them.</p>
        <p>Many steps remain in that process, however, and it could take months. In June 1998, a group headed by Michael Ovitz, former president of the Walt Disney Company, took over Livent. Two months later the new executives said they had discovered millions of dollars of accounting problems in the company's books.</p>
