        <p>ON the morning after the pro basketball marathon finally ended, Jerry Krause looked out the window of his office at the Chicago Bulls' practice facility and there was the co-rookie of the year, Elton Brand, working on his footwork for next season, four-and-a-half-months away and counting.</p>
        <p>A couple of the Bulls' other young players, Ron Artest and Michael Ruffin, were also in the building, energizing Krause as he planned for the college draft and free-agent season, the time of year when general managers become franchise players.</p>
        <p>''To me, Jerry West is responsible for what happened in Los Angeles last night,'' Krause said yesterday. ''He's the one who maneuvered to get that team under the cap so they could sign Shaquille O'Neal. He's the one who made the Kobe Bryant deal happen. But he's getting far less credit than he should. Instead you hear, well, other things.''</p>
        <p>You hear about Phil Jackson winning in his first coaching try out of Chicago, without Michael Jordan, for whom he has always had the ultimate respect, and without Krause, for whom he has had, well, other things.</p>
        <p>Intramural pettiness aside, Jackson deserves a round of applause for being able to take his high-profile act elsewhere and immediately succeed. Ditto West, who restored the Lakers to prominence 12 years after they last won the title and nine years after their last trip to the National Basketball Association finals.</p>
        <p>If that sounds like a long time, consider when Boston and Detroit, those erstwhile Lakers combatants in championship series past, might next play in June.</p>
        <p>Krause spoke with West last week, the Pacers still nipping at Shaq's heels, and West admitting that he was sweating, as in the old days. ''He was saying that you go along for years trying to put your team back into position where it has a realistic chance to win, and then the pressure of feeling like you have to win hits you,'' Krause said. ''At the end of our run here in Chicago, we were playing not to lose. You get a little excited when you start to think that soon, we could be playing to win.''</p>
        <p>There are no guarantees that the stripped-to-the-Brand Bulls will soon be very good, or any good. Yet just as Jackson's achievements should not pass without a proper salute, nor can the work Krause has done steering his team into quality rebuilding position. Less than two years after critics foolishly blamed him for the deconstruction that had to occur the moment Elvis left the building, he is taking two first-round selections, Nos. 4 and 7, and six picks in all into next week's draft. For a class of talented and potentially dominant free agents who are in various stages of home-team disaffection, the Bulls are armed and ready, $19 million under the salary cap.</p>
        <p>Again, there are no sure things, but considering the altitude from which the Bulls fell, Krause has a chance to author one of the fastest and greatest retooling jobs in the history of the sport.</p>
        <p>As a mass-appeal phenomenon, the N.B.A. suffered a descent that has been, at least by measure of public perception, parallel to the Bulls'. Television ratings fell precipitously, no shock considering how invested in one player the league and its synergistic partners were. Golf may be the current ratings rage, but if Tiger Woods left Earth tomorrow to defy the gravitational odds elsewhere, golf would revert to the modest, elitist draw it was.</p>
        <p>David Stern was right when he called this season a ''transitional year where the fans are getting to know our new players.'' The commissioner's marketing machine tried too hard with Vince Carter, but the league does have a solid nucleus of young stars, and, as we've seen with Kobe, the kind who really want to validate themselves with championship rings.</p>
        <p>''I don't know what these people are talking about when they say it was a bad season,'' said Krause, the lifer who was thrilled by the finals and the sight of games again featuring the art of scoring the ball.</p>
        <p>His team won 17 games, but to measure the Bulls' standing by number of victories distorts the context of how one can best cope with prosperity's end. While a phenomenon such as Jordan bloats interest, fan bases don't disappear overnight. Krause has noticed that the White Sox fans, thought to be an endangered species in Chicago, are returning in droves to Comiskey Park. Those 23,000 Bulls fans at the United Center won't stay forever, but, as Krause said, with any luck, they'll have a competitive team again soon.</p>
        <p>For team and league, two years is a snap of the finger, a blink of an eye, a chance to work on footwork and take small steps forward.</p>
