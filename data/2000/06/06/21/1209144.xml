        <p>On the same day that the Supreme Court ruled that officially sanctioned prayers at public school athletic contests were unconstitutional (front page, June 20), the court also refused to hear an appeal of a lower court's decision that a Louisiana board of education could not put a ''disclaimer'' in its high school science books suggesting that religious views should be considered as alternatives to the theory of evolution.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>On the same day that the Supreme Court ruled that officially sanctioned prayers at public school athletic contests were unconstitutional (front page, June 20), the court also refused to hear an appeal of a lower court's decision that a Louisiana board of education could not put a ''disclaimer'' in its high school science books suggesting that religious views should be considered as alternatives to the theory of evolution.</p>
        <p>Disclaimers are only one of the strategies used by the religious right to undermine science education. Others include ''scientific creationism,'' rejected by the Supreme Court as having the clear intent to promote a sectarian religious view, and ''intelligent design theory,'' which asserts that living organisms are too complex to have evolved through natural mechanisms but must have been designed by a supernatural creator. The court was right to agree that such disclaimers don't promote education; they subvert it.</p>
