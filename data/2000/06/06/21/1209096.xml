        <p>Kenneth Noe Jr. does not sound like an executive who runs a $250 million-a-year business. His speech still belongs to the barns and exercise tracks where he grew up, the son of a jockey and horse trainer.</p>
        <p>''I ain't a society person,'' Noe, the 71-year-old head of the New York Racing Association, said. ''My heart's always been on the backside, and everyone knows that.''</p>
        <p>Since taking over the racing association almost six years ago, Noe's plain-spoken and direct style has inspired both admiration and enmity, but little in between.</p>
        <p>His admirers say he has saved New York's premier tracks -- Belmont, Aqueduct and Saratoga -- from bankruptcy, raised purses for horsemen and improved everything from bathrooms to barns to blacktops.</p>
        <p>Two weeks ago, nearly 68,000 fans jammed Belmont Park for the Belmont Stakes, even though the field was lackluster after the winners of both the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness dropped out of the race. Then, in an added sign of Belmont Park's allure, it was selected last week as the site for the Breeders' Cup, racing's richest day, in October 2001.</p>
        <p>''If Kenny Noe didn't come to New York, we would be in serious, serious trouble,'' Billy Badgett, a trainer, said. ''We have all seen what he can get done. Probably the most amazing thing is he's not afraid to bang heads to get things done.''</p>
        <p>But his critics say he is a petty tyrant who has treated the tracks like a fief, running roughshod over contracting procedures and, in one case, giving a million-dollar contract to a company linked to organized crime. A few trainers also said Noe had punished trainers who disagreed with him on labor issues by moving them to inferior stalls.</p>
        <p>In the end, though, Noe's greatest achievement may be the survival of the racing association itself, a nonprofit corporation that was formed in 1955 to consolidate and modernize New York's dilapidated tracks under a unique state franchise. In 1997, Noe managed to fight off attempts to sell the tracks to private interests, persuading Gov. George E. Pataki and the State Legislature to extend the association's franchise until 2007.</p>
        <p>He did this largely by marshaling the resources of the racing association's trustees, among them New York's oldest wealthy families, including the Whitney and Phipps families. In the eighteen months before the franchise was extended, trustees allied with Noe, many of whom had seldom been politically active before, gave more than $176,000 to state Republican committees and $41,000 to a Democratic state committee, campaign records show. ''I said, 'Guys, this is a way of life whether you like it or not,' '' Noe said of the contributions. ''I never apologized for that.''</p>
        <p>Sitting in his office at Aqueduct recently, Noe ticked off his major accomplishments. The racing association is making a modest profit for the first time in years. Nearly $40 million has been spent on capital improvements, and the tracks are in better physical shape than they have been in years.</p>
        <p>He has also raised purses in New York and cut the price of admissions and for food and drink. He won the legalization of Lasix, a drug used to help horses who develop nosebleeds during competition, drawing more elite horses to New York.</p>
        <p>A Key Fiscal Maneuver</p>
        <p>But some critics say there is less than meets the eye to the racing association's financial turnaround. They say Noe rescued the agency mostly by winning a steep reduction from Albany in state taxes on parimutuel bets -- from 5 percent to 3.5 percent -- and increasing the proportion of bets that goes to the racing association for operating expenses and purses.</p>
        <p>In 1994, for instance, the association, known as NYRA, lost $11 million in its operations, but it also paid about $30 million in parimutuel taxes to the state. In 1999, the tracks earned $3.8 million in profits, but gave only $15.8 million to the state.</p>
        <p>Revenues from broadcasting the tracks' races to other states have increased rapidly: to $39 million in 1998 from $24 million in 1995. But attendance at the tracks has not grown significantly. About 2.5 million people a year have come through the turnstiles, down from 3.1 million in 1993. On-track betting has continued a steady and consistent slide over the same period, to about $524 million a year from $782 million annually.</p>
        <p>Perhaps more ominous, Noe's efforts to acquire off-track betting parlors operated by New York City and other local governments have gone nowhere. Some racing experts consider buying OTB critical to the racing association's long-term survival, since it would then gain a greater share of the $1.1 billion bet annually at off-track parlors.</p>
        <p>For his part, Noe acknowledges he has been frustrated with the stubbornly small crowds at the tracks on most days and the reluctance of New York City, which owns the lucrative OTB parlors in the five boroughs, to sell them. But he says he believes that in the long run NYRA will survive as one of the nation's premier racing circuits, because the increase in purses has attracted better horses and trainers. Better races, in his view, will attract more fans and better simulcasting deals. ''The quality is here, and when you have quality you will survive,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Ogden Mills Phipps, whose family has been a powerful force on the racing association's board for decades, played a pivotal role in bringing Noe in as president in October 1994. At the time, attendance was sliding, taxes were high and the tracks were losing more than $10 million a year.</p>
        <p>The political landscape changed almost immediately. The following month, Pataki, a Republican, defeated Mario M. Cuomo, a longtime critic of the racing organization, in the gubernatorial race. Then Senator Joseph Bruno, a Republican who represents the Saratoga region, became the Senate majority leader. Noe lobbied for and got the tax relief that his predecessor, Gerald McKeon, had never been able to win from the Cuomo administration.</p>
        <p>Noe also quickly earned a reputation for ruthless budget cutting. He forced into retirement or dismissed more than 200 people, including several top executives who had spent their careers with NYRA.</p>
        <p>The layoffs created some resentment toward Noe among some old-timers in New York racing circles, but it was the way he went about awarding contracts that eventually led to a state investigation.</p>
        <p>Noe had made his mark in thoroughbred racing as the president of Calder Race Course near Miami, a privately owned track that he ran with an iron hand for more than 15 years. ''I had worked for an individual that said you do what you want to and you spend what you want to,'' Noe said. ''I like to see things move and move fast.''</p>
        <p>The Glass Wall Incident</p>
        <p>In New York he decided to hire a Queens contractor to enclose in glass part of the third and fourth floors of the Belmont grandstand. ''I wanted the glass enclosure because I didn't want the clerks freezing to death,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The glass contract was awarded to AVM, which submitted the low bid of $963,000 in January 1996. Several aspects of the contract were questionable, state investigators later found. Federal law enforcement officials say that the company's owners, Andre and Vincent Mormile, were associates of the Gambino crime family. Though AVM had been winning contracts with the racing association since 1989, the company was not incorporated at the time it was awarded the glass-wall contract.</p>
        <p>Nor did the Mormiles have experience in building glass walls that could withstand high winds, auditors later found.</p>
        <p>Noe has said he first learned of the Mormiles's organized crime connections in September 1996, when the trustees asked for a background check. ''I had no idea who they were,'' he said. ''I don't know any organized crime people.''</p>
        <p>Dennis Vacco, then the state attorney general, started an investigation in August 1996. No evidence of criminal wrongdoing was found, though state auditors did discover lax contracting procedures. An investigator on the case, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the association's procedures could be called sloppy at best.</p>
        <p>Noe contends the inquiry was politically motivated. He also says he has since instituted stricter contracting procedures.</p>
        <p>AVM never actually built the glass wall, even though the racing association advanced the company $522,000 for materials. The wall was finally completed this year by racetrack workers. Noe estimates that his agency, which was able to recoup some materials from AVM, lost about $200,000 on the contract.</p>
        <p>The yearlong investigation did nothing to slow Noe down on legislative fronts. Pataki, Bruno and the Assembly leadership agreed to extend NYRA's franchise in September 1997, though the governor insisted on adding five more appointees to the 28-member board.</p>
        <p>Noe, meanwhile, distanced himself from the daily operation. He resigned as president and was elevated to chairman of the trustees and chief executive officer, becoming the only paid official in the association's history to be chairman of the board.</p>
        <p>These days, Noe says he spends about a third to half of his time in New York, and the rest at his home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. His salary is not public. He runs the organization through his longtime lieutenant, Terry Meyocks, who is now president. Meyocks and Noe say they confer about three times a day.</p>
        <p>A Tough Man to Work For</p>
        <p>As a manager, Noe has received mixed reviews. At Calder, he curbed corruption by summarily exiling from the track dozens of trainers whom he believed were dishonest. He also rewarded trainers he liked with prime stall space and punished others for shipping their horses out to other tracks.</p>
        <p>In New York, some of those same tactics stirred controversy. His aides describe him as tough but fair. ''He's a tough guy to work for,'' said William Nader, the official in charge of marketing. ''You better produce, and you better work. He's not going to tolerate anything less. Some people might be intimidated by him.''</p>
        <p>His critics say Noe is heavy-handed, brooks no criticism and carries out petty vendettas against people who cross him. ''He's very autocratic,'' said Jim Hayes, whom Noe fired as chief of operations in 1995. ''If you didn't see eye to eye, you were in serious trouble.''</p>
        <p>That stern vision was evident in the case of Dr. Michael Galvin, a veterinarian accused by racing officials of illegally drugging a horse at Aqueduct in 1998.</p>
        <p>Although state investigators could not prove the horse had been drugged, Noe and Meyocks suspended Galvin from the racing association's tracks after a hearing. Galvin successfully challenged the suspension in court. Undeterred, Noe began a second set of hearings against Galvin, invoking an arcane track rule against medical equipment in barns. The dispute was settled, with Galvin permitted to work at the tracks.</p>
        <p>''Noe does go after people,'' said Galvin's lawyer, Karen Murphy, who was dropped by the horsemen's association as its counsel with Noe's encouragement because she was Galvin's ally, according to trainers and court documents. ''If you stand in his way, you are mowed down.''</p>
        <p>Noe says he still believes Galvin was guilty and that he wanted to send a strong message to other cheaters. ''We had to start somewhere,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''I put the industry before me and my family and I think everyone else should too,'' Noe said. ''If you hurt this industry, I've got nothing to do with you.''</p>
