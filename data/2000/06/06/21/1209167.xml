        <p>The operators of the new Hotel Sofitel, on 44th Street between Fifth Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas, have set a deadline for its opening: July 14, Bastille Day.</p>
        <p>The day is an appropriate choice for the hotel's developer and manager, Accor, a company based in Paris whose other brands include Novotel and Motel 6. Executives of Accor North America say they plan to emphasize the hotel's French roots in its decor and operations as a way of differentiating the property in the increasingly crowded hotel market in the Times Square area.</p>
        <p>The hotel will include 400 guest rooms, including 51 suites; a 130-seat, brasserie-style restaurant called Gaby; a 2,500-square-foot grand ballroom and seven other meeting rooms; a lobby with seating for 32; and a gift shop selling mostly French-made goods.</p>
        <p>Squeezing all this onto a 15,800-square-foot, T-shaped site stretching from 44th to 45th Street was a challenge, said Yann LeRoy, the chief designer for the project for Brennan Beer Gorman Architects. ''We had to balance usage with image,'' Mr. LeRoy said. ''It is rare to find a client with a desire to establish an image through architecture.''</p>
        <p>The result is a building mostly sheathed in limestone and precast concrete, but with a curved glass and metal tower facing 44th Street. The 31-story, $100 million structure has 280,000 square feet of space.</p>
        <p>Accor officials were eager to have the entrance on 44th Street, in close proximity to hotels like the Algonquin, Royalton and Iroquois, and to establishments like the adjacent New York Yacht Club and the Harvard Club. In contrast, 45th Street is mostly office buildings with mixed retail at the ground level.</p>
        <p>''Forty-fourth Street is much classier than 45th,'' said John Lehodey, president of Accor North America. He said that Sofitel was its top-scale brand in this country and that every Sofitel has its own individual architecture, in contrast to the less expensive Novotel hotels, which follow a standard design. Rooms at the Sofitel will run $350 a night, with suites priced at $450 a night.</p>
        <p>Hospitality experts said the hotel should be easily absorbed in the booming market. ''New York has the highest occupancy rate in the nation and the most turnaways by a factor of three,'' said Bjorn Hanson, who leads the hospitality and leisure practice at PricewaterhouseCoopers, an accounting and consulting firm. He said the occupancy rate had stayed at a very high level despite the addition of 6,400 rooms over the last year. According to the most recent figures compiled by the firm, which are for April, the hotel occupancy rate for the city was 89.1 percent, the highest in 20 years.</p>
        <p>The average rate for a room reached $245.27 before taxes in April, up 11.7 percent from April 1999.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lehodey said the new Sofitel's interior public spaces would be decorated in Art Deco style, popular in both France and the United States in the 1920's. Mr. LeRoy said he took to the project naturally. ''I'm French and it is a French company, so we worked well together,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The big design decision, Mr. LeRoy said, was to put the core of the building, the elevators and major utility lines, where the two legs of the T met. That freed most of the space facing 44th Street for the lobby and ballroom above it. The 45th Street end, where the top bar of the T is, houses most of the guest rooms, with the restaurant and bar on the ground floor opening on 45th Street.</p>
        <p>The glass tower facing 44th is well back from the street and offers views of landmarks like the Chrysler Building. Many of the 51 suites are in the glass tower, which has lightly tinted glass at the lower levels with a darker shade on the upper part.</p>
        <p>The tower sits on top of an entry on 44th Street that was limited to the four-story height of the Yacht Club, which is just east of the hotel.</p>
        <p>The guest rooms are finished with desks that have electric power outlets and jacks at the height of the writing surface, so laptop computers can easily be connected to the Internet. The bathrooms include a separate bathtub and shower stall, and original art, rather than reproductions, is hung on the walls.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lehodey said he expected that most of the guests at the hotel would be in New York on business but added that he was expecting substantial numbers of tourists, particularly in the summer when business travel slacks off. He said the proximity of the hotel to a revitalized Times Square should be attractive to tourists. Reduced rates will be available during times of slower demand.</p>
        <p>But in recognition that a bustling city was also a noisy one, he said special attention was given to soundproofing the guest rooms, both from street noise and internal sounds.</p>
        <p>With the hotel's compact size and design, the guest rooms can be cleaned and resupplied directly from service areas not visible to guests. ''You will never see a maid cart in the hallway,'' said Eric Anderouard, the Sofitel's general manager.</p>
