        <p>President Clinton today proposed increasing Medicare payments to hospitals, nursing homes and other health care providers, as evidence grew that cuts made in 1997 had harmed the quality of care around the country.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton asked Congress to increase payments to providers by $21 billion in the next five years and by $40 billion over 10 years.</p>
        <p>The proposals represent an abrupt reversal by the administration. In his budget request just five months ago, Mr. Clinton asked Congress to cut payments to providers by $30 billion over the next 10 years.</p>
        <p>The original cuts were made with bipartisan support in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Lawmakers wanted to slow the growth of Medicare, but the savings have far exceeded expectations. Medicare spending declined last year by nearly 1 percent, to $209 billion. It was the first decline since the creation of the Medicare program in 1965.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton asked Congress today to increase Medicare payments to hospitals, home health agencies and nursing homes, and he proposed a small increase for health maintenance organizations.</p>
        <p>The first three industries welcomed the proposals. But H.M.O. executives said that they were disappointed and that the proposed increases would not be enough to prevent H.M.O.'s from pulling out of Medicare.</p>
        <p>''The administration seems not to be addressing the crisis facing Medicare beneficiaries in H.M.O.'s,'' said Karen M. Ignagni, president of the American Association of Health Plans.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, hailed the proposal. Hospitals in the New York area have laid off workers because of financial problems that they trace to the 1997 law.</p>
        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Democratic candidate for the United States Senate in New York, has expressed concern about the adequacy of Medicare payments to teaching hospitals. But Chris Jennings, the health policy coordinator at the White House, said, ''She did not develop, design, approve or review'' the proposals announced today.</p>
        <p>The president is, in effect, getting out in front of a parade that has already begun to form on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers are scrambling to help health care providers.</p>
        <p>Home health care has been hit harder than any other service in the last two years. Medicare spending on home care dropped 45 percent, to $9.7 billion in 1999 from $17.5 billion in 1997. Under current law, payments will be cut by 15 percent in October 2001.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton said today that Congress should delay that cut for one year. But Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said: ''The White House plan is not enough. The 15 percent cut in home health payments should be eliminated altogether.''</p>
        <p>Many lawmakers share that view.</p>
        <p>Until now, lobbyists for the elderly, seeking new prescription drug benefits, had seen themselves as competing with health care providers for scarce federal dollars.</p>
        <p>But with estimates of the federal budget surplus soaring, and with the Medicare trust fund solvent until 2025, Mr. Clinton said today, ''I believe we can do both'' -- enhance payments to providers and add drug benefits to Medicare.</p>
        <p>It is not at all certain that Congress will do both this year. Politically, it is easy to increase payments to providers, by changing just a few words in Medicare reimbursement formulas. But lawmakers have had immense difficulty agreeing on Medicare drug benefits.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton explained in detail how he wanted to spend half of the money he proposed to give health care providers. Use of the other half would be decided with Congress.</p>
        <p>These are the highlights of the president's plan:</p>
        <p>*Hospitals would receive $5 billion over five years and $10 billion over 10 years. They would receive a full allowance for inflation, increasing their Medicare payments about 3 percent, rather than the 2 percent expected under current law. Medicare would increase special payments to teaching hospitals and to hospitals that serve large numbers of poor people.</p>
        <p>*Home health agencies would receive $2 billion over five years and $3 billion over 10 years. Home care agencies would get a 3.4 percent increase for inflation, rather than the 2.3 percent expected under current law.</p>
        <p>*Nursing homes would receive $1 billion over five years and $2 billion over 10 years. Restrictions on physical, occupational and speech therapy would be delayed a year.</p>
        <p>Medicare officials had minimized complaints from health care providers. But the White House changed its tune today, saying Medicare cuts appeared to ''undermine access to quality health care services'' as ''hospitals' financial status has deteriorated significantly since 1997.''</p>
