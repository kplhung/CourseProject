        <p>The Canadian software developer Corel Corporation reported a loss of $23.6 million, or 36 cents a share, for the second quarter ended May 31, on revenue of $36.6 million. Profit a year ago was $9.2 million, or 14 cents a share, on sales of $70.5 million. With sales of its older graphics design products in decline, Corel has tied its future to acceptance of the Linux operating system. The staff was cut 21 percent earlier this month to help trim costs by $40 million a year, and an equity financing has been arranged to shore up a cash position of less than $10 million. The chief executive, Michael Cowpland, said recently that Corel would be in the black by the fourth quarter.</p>
