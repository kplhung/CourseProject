        <p>AS Americans got to know the pleasures of authentic Italian regional cuisines in the last 15 years, old-fashioned Italian-American cooking became themebound, buried under a corny torrent of fake forebears and canned opera. The 1990's rise of the family-style Italian restaurant, which served portions by the bucketful, called for huge groups, replicating a nostalgic image of big, boisterous Italian families. With one wave of a garlic-bread wand, these restaurants offered a vision of the past through a red-and-white-check lens.</p>
        <p>Now I enjoy garlic-drenched linguine with clam sauce and platters of sausages and peppers as much as the next person, but I find it hard to eat surrounded by portraits of imaginary ancestors with the theme from ''The Godfather'' playing again and again.

        <p>AS Americans got to know the pleasures of authentic Italian regional cuisines in the last 15 years, old-fashioned Italian-American cooking became themebound, buried under a corny torrent of fake forebears and canned opera. The 1990's rise of the family-style Italian restaurant, which served portions by the bucketful, called for huge groups, replicating a nostalgic image of big, boisterous Italian families. With one wave of a garlic-bread wand, these restaurants offered a vision of the past through a red-and-white-check lens.</p>
        <p>Now I enjoy garlic-drenched linguine with clam sauce and platters of sausages and peppers as much as the next person, but I find it hard to eat surrounded by portraits of imaginary ancestors with the theme from ''The Godfather'' playing again and again. So it was a great relief to find Osso Buco, a family-style Italian-American restaurant on the Upper East Side that manages to remove the meal from the mythology.</p>
        <p>Instead of displaying the usual kitsch, Osso Buco's multilevel dining room is almost defiantly modest, with oblong lamps; clean, uncluttered surfaces; and the sort of red, yellow and black color scheme that you might find in a chain franchise at a mall. Actually, Osso Buco is the low-end entry of a New York minichain owned by Nino Selimaj that includes another Osso Buco in Greenwich Village, Nino's on the Upper East Side and Nino's Positano in Midtown.</p>
        <p>Osso Buco's menu includes nothing surprising or unusual, naturally, but much of the food is tasty and satisfying, with far more high points than lows. And it's a good value: the family-style portions, described as double size, are closer to triple. Even so, Osso Buco is much more of a casual neighborhood place than a destination for big groups. I saw more than a few couples stopping in after work to share a plate of pasta or veal. What's more family style, after all, than for everybody to eat the same meal?</p>
        <p>It's hard to imagine better fried calamari ($15.95). The light, crisp breading enhances the flavor of the squid rather than obliterating it, and needs no more than a squeeze of lemon and perhaps a shake of salt. Tricolore salad ($11) is refreshing, with a welcome touch of bitterness for character, and Caesar salad ($11), while not made tableside in the classic manner, is well dressed in a Parmesan, Worcestershire and anchovy coating. Baked clams ($13) not only are tender but offer detectable clam flavor and texture from under the traditional mush of bread crumbs, garlic and herbs.</p>
        <p>I was very happy with trenette al pesto ($15.95), a fringed ribbon pasta in a creamy, harmonious basil sauce, and with linguine in a garlicky white clam sauce ($18.50). And while cheese ravioli with a Tuscan meat sauce ($17.95) is hearty and satisfying, most of the tomato-based pastas, like rigatoni with broccoli and fennel sausage ($17.95) and spaghetti with meatballs ($16.95), are mundane.</p>
        <p>Chicken dishes are likewise dull, like pollo alla fiorentina ($16.95), a chicken breast in white wine with mushrooms and spinach that seemed intended for people who hate flavor. But the veal dishes shine, particularly saltimbocca ($18), a Friday night special that was the classic match of nutty prosciutto, sage and spinach with rich veal. Veal piccata ($18.50), thin cutlets in a light sauce of lemon and white wine, and the restaurant's namesake, osso buco ($34), a bright and hearty veal shank stew, are also good. I did not try the most expensive dish on the menu, a 40-ounce porterhouse steak for $48.</p>
        <p>The wine list includes just the sort of light, fruity wines that go well with this food, like a rosso di Montalcino ($29, from Caparzo) and a pinot grigio ($19, from Castello d'Albola).</p>
        <p>Service at Osso Buco is efficient and professional, blissfully free of singing waiters and overly gregarious types. For me, the biggest surprise came on my second visit, when the ''Godfather'' theme suddenly welled up in the background, where quiet jazz had been playing, and then disappeared. It was a reminder that nostalgia and mythology can be quite enjoyable, especially when you're not banged over the head with it.</p>
