        <p>OPEC ministers meeting today in Vienna are expected to agree on a modest production increase, but the move is unlikely to bring much relief to American gasoline consumers who are paying more than $2 a gallon in some regions.</p>
        <p>''If U.S. consumers are looking to the OPEC meeting as some kind of salvation from gas prices this summer, they will be very disappointed,'' said Raad Alkadiri, an analyst with the Petroleum Finance Corporation, a consulting group in Washington.</p>
        <p>Oil ministers arriving for their meeting in Vienna today said they were confident they would reach an agreement quickly, and a consensus appears to have formed around an increase of 500,000 barrels a day, or about 2 percent of current output. Such an increase has the support not only of Saudi Arabia, the most influential OPEC member, but also the support of Iran, which angrily rebelled at a production increase three months ago.</p>
        <p>But the ministers of Algeria and Qatar said in preparing for the Vienna meeting that there was no shortage of oil in the world, apparently suggesting that raising output by that much is not necessary. Oil prices, which have surged in recent weeks, rose further today on the conflicting messages.</p>
        <p>In the supply-and-demand balance, most people have focused on the supply side ever since crude prices began climbing last year. Understandably so, because a decision by OPEC in early 1999 to cut supply led to a sharp rebound in oil prices, driving them to more than $30 a barrel by this spring.</p>
        <p>In March, under heavy pressure by the United States and other industrialized countries that import petroleum, OPEC decided to increase production by 1.7 million barrels a day, or about 7 percent, to about 24.7 million barrels a day. Crude prices initially dipped, only to surpass the $30 mark once again in the last few weeks, despite estimates by many analysts that OPEC is already pumping about 500,000 barrels more than it had agreed upon three months ago. At the same time, average United States gasoline prices have risen sharply, up nearly 13 percent since late April, according to the Department of Energy. They show no sign of easing just as the summer driving season is starting.</p>
        <p>In the Great Lakes region, where gasoline costs more than $2 a gallon, consumer anger has led to federal inquiries into possible price gouging by area refineries.</p>
        <p>Even at such levels, gasoline prices adjusted for inflation are still lower than they were for most of the century up to 1968, according to a recent study by Cambridge Energy Research Associates.</p>
        <p>''But this is a price that people very easily get very angry about,'' said Daniel Yergin, chairman of Cambridge Energy.</p>
        <p>OPEC leaders like the Saudis have intimated that they, like much of the rest of the world, are uncomfortable with current high crude prices. If prices stay above $30 for a long time, that could hurt the economies of affluent oil-consuming countries and even lead to a recession, which would hurt OPEC as much as anyone else.</p>
        <p>But any OPEC increase in output would deal only with the supply side of the equation. Worldwide demand for oil, driven by the robust American economy and strengthening recoveries in Asia and Europe, continues to grow and quickly absorb OPEC supply increases.</p>
        <p>For example, United States refineries that distill crude, the first step in making gasoline, are operating at 94 percent of capacity, which is considered high. And despite persistent complaints about inflationary gasoline prices, Americans have yet to curtail their driving, AAA, the former American Automobile Association, has reported.</p>
        <p>The relentless demand for petroleum in the United States may, in fact, be a principal reason for the rise in crude prices.</p>
        <p>The Chicago area, where gasoline has risen to $2.50 a gallon at some stations in recent days, illustrates how prices and crude oil production are not directly related.</p>
        <p>The stage for the run-up was set in late winter, when refineries typically acquire crude to meet high gasoline demand over the summer. A heating oil crisis compelled some United States refineries to keep producing heating oil rather than shifting to gasoline.</p>
        <p>While crude was expensive at the time, market prices for oil to be delivered in later months was decreasing. So rather than replenishing their inventories at the higher prices, many refineries bought crude for delivery later at the lower prices, something of a ''just in time'' strategy.</p>
        <p>Consequently, inventories of gasoline are now unusually low across the country, with stocks in the week ending June 9 totaling 202.7 million gallons, compared with 223.5 million last year, according to the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group.</p>
        <p>Drawing on lower-than-usual inventories, Great Lakes refineries now must produce a reformulated gasoline that burns cleaner in adherence with the latest Environmental Protection Agency regulations. Because of how this gasoline is made, refineries produce less of it than they do of conventional gasoline.</p>
        <p>Gasoline supplies in the Great Lakes fell even lower when a pipeline that feeds oil from the Gulf Coast to the region's refineries broke down in the spring. That pipeline is still operating at only 80 percent capacity, according to the American Petroleum Institute.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A. contends that its requirements for reformulated gasoline do not contribute to higher fuel prices. But AAA has asked the agency to suspend reformulated gasoline requirements for parts of the country, including the Midwest, for most of the summer because the cleaner-burning fuel costs so much.</p>
        <p>''Reformulated gasoline is a premium product and tighter requirements mean it will be more expensive,'' said George Beranek, an expert on refining at the Petroleum Finance Corporation. ''You can't mandate improvement and expect it to be free.''</p>
