        <p>The Yankees have begun discussing possible trade combinations for Sammy Sosa, according to baseball officials, and while the two sides have more work to do, the Yankees have not blanched at what they heard from the Cubs and could close on a deal quickly.</p>
        <p>The Yankees have also moved deeper into trade talks for Detroit's Juan Gonzalez. This morning, Yankee officials faxed a list of prospects they would be willing to dangle for Gonzalez.</p>
        <p>Cubs officials told the Yankees two weeks ago that they would need a significant package in return for Sosa, one of the game's most popular players. The Cubs have been scouting the Yankees' entire organization for about two weeks, and Yankee officials have been concerned, as they wait to hear from the Cubs, that the asking price will be exorbitant.</p>
        <p>But the names forwarded by the Cubs make some officials believe that the teams can eventually reach an agreement. Before a trade is completed, the Yankees would have to negotiate a contract extension with Sosa, who possesses the right to veto any deal. Sosa could command a multiyear extension for about $18 million to $20 million per season; his current deal expires after the 2001 season.</p>
        <p>The Yankees would have to surrender their top prospect, Alfonso Soriano, in a Sosa deal, and would probably include prospects like Randy Keisler, a minor league pitcher, as well as the right-hander Jake Westbrook and outfielder Ricky Ledee.</p>
        <p>The relationship between the Cubs and Sosa has deteriorated this year, part of the reason Chicago is considering trading the most popular member of the franchise.</p>
        <p>There are about 10 to 15 players on the list submitted to the Tigers in the Gonzalez talks, an organization executive said. The Yankees are not eager to part with Soriano or another top prospect, Drew Henson, but that does not necessarily mean those players will not be included in the talks at some point.</p>
        <p>Many of the players on the list are likely to be younger prospects who do not have credentials quite as impressive as Henson, a third baseman considered a top power hitter.</p>
        <p>Dave Walling, the Yankees' top pick in the 1999 draft, likely was on the list, as well as Brian Rogers, a fifth-round pick from the 1999 draft, and outfielder Jackson Melian, who is batting .255 for the Class AA Norwich Navigators.</p>
        <p>With several weeks remaining before the July 31 trade deadline, the pace of the negotiations has been slow. Executives from the Yankees and the Tigers spoke regularly last week, but did not communicate Monday, as the Yankee officials prepared the list of prospects they forwarded to the Tigers today. But club officials say George Steinbrenner is pressing his executives to make a move.</p>
        <p>Both the Cubs and Tigers will at least ask for Henson, a player the scouts believe has a chance to make a major impact. He attends the University of Michigan and could be highly attractive to the Tigers, but he would be an enormous risk for Detroit, as well.</p>
        <p>Henson is a quarterback for Michigan and is undecided about whether he wants to play football or baseball as a professional. For that reason alone, the Tigers would probably not want to build a deal for Gonzalez around Henson.</p>
        <p>But if the size of the deal begins to expand, and the Yankees ask to include a pitcher -- like the starter Hideo Nomo or the reliever Doug Brocail -- then the Tigers would almost certainly insist that Henson be part of the deal, in addition to other prospects.</p>
        <p>Starting Rotation in Disarray</p>
        <p>Mel Stottlemyre, the Yankees' pitching coach, could project his starting rotation weeks in advance in 1998 and 1999. Now he is going day to day because of the injuries to Roger Clemens and Orlando Hernandez. It was determined after Sunday's game that El Duque has a sprained elbow. Wednesday he will be in Alabama to visit Dr. James Andrews for a second opinion. General Manager Brian Cashman was headed to Alabama today, probably to accompany Hernandez on the visit.</p>
        <p>But in spite of the precautions, Yankee officials remain confident that Hernandez will be able to return to the rotation soon. It is just a question of timing.</p>
        <p>David Cone and Jake Westbrook will pitch Wednesday and Thursday, and Manager Joe Torre said that if Hernandez could pitch this weekend in Chicago, he would most likely use Ramiro Mendoza and Andy Pettitte on three days' rest Friday and Saturday, respectively. If Hernandez cannot pitch and the Yankees need someone to take his place, then another pitcher, most likely Ted Lilly, will be promoted from Class AAA Columbus.</p>
        <p>In that case, Hernandez would be placed on the 15-day disabled list, retroactive to Monday. Lilly is 3-4 with a 4.73 earned run average for the Clippers, having averaged about six and one-third innings in his seven starts for Columbus. Clemens is eligible to come off the disabled list on June 30.</p>
        <p>Leyritz Dealt for Vizcaino</p>
        <p>The Yankees traded Jim Leyritz -- a hero of the 1996 World Series who left for four other major league teams, the minors and then returned last July -- to the Dodgers for the infielder Jose Vizcaino and cash.</p>
        <p>The Yankees have two reasons to make the move: first, Leyritz has been a disappointment this season, lacking bat speed and batting .218 with one home run and four runs batted in; second, the Yankees now have a veteran who could fill in for Chuck Knoblauch if the second baseman's throwing problems become so acute that they would move him to designated hitter.</p>
        <p>Vizcaino, 32, in his 12th major league season, is a switch-hitter who plays second base, third and shortstop. Vizcaino, a former Met, was hitting .204 with 4 r.b.i. this season for the Dodgers.</p>
