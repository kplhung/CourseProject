        <p>March Expands</p>
        <p>March, 405 East 58th Street, is to reopen on Friday after two months of renovation, which increased seating from 50 to 85 but retained the restaurant's elegant intimacy. From the main dining area a staircase leads down to a new bar and dining room. Another goes up to a greenhouse room with a terrace. The kitchen was also expanded, but Wayne Nish's Asian-inspired menu is the same.</p>

        <p>March Expands</p>
        <p>March, 405 East 58th Street, is to reopen on Friday after two months of renovation, which increased seating from 50 to 85 but retained the restaurant's elegant intimacy. From the main dining area a staircase leads down to a new bar and dining room. Another goes up to a greenhouse room with a terrace. The kitchen was also expanded, but Wayne Nish's Asian-inspired menu is the same.</p>
        <p>Annisa Opens</p>
        <p>Anita Lo, who cooked Korean-accented Asian food at Mirezi on Fifth Avenue at 13th Street, has opened her own restaurant, Annisa, at 13 Barrow Street (West Fourth). Asian-accented food does not dominate the menu.</p>
        <p>''I felt a little stifled at Mirezi,'' said the French-trained Ms. Lo, who is preparing dishes like chicken stuffed with pig's feet and chanterelles, and soft-shell crab with corn and sea urchin salad.</p>
        <p>Right Bank Loses Roof</p>
        <p>The Right Bank, a bistro from pre-bistro days at 822 Madison Avenue (68th Street), has lost its lease. It will close on Saturday after 41 years. Anton Vatavuk, who has owned the restaurant for nearly 20 of those years, is looking for another location.</p>
        <p>Short Orders:</p>
        <p>Azucar, a tapas restaurant, has opened at 426 Amsterdam Avenue (82nd Street).</p>
        <p>Chelsea Bar and Billiards, the city's first billiard parlor with an emphasis on food, has opened at 54 West 21st Street. The chef, Arra Lawson, who was at Palladin, serves small plates of Mediterranean-inspired dishes, like cue-stick chicken skewers with Moroccan dipping sauce. Food is served after 5 p.m.</p>
        <p>A name like Abajour more readily suggests a French-accented American bistro menu than the previous choice, Tony Macgregor's, for the restaurant at 1134 First Avenue (62nd Street). The new name, a mis-spelled but easily pronounced version of the French word abat-jour, meaning lampshade, refers to one strong element in the decor.</p>
        <p>In late summer, Sushi Samba, the Latin-accented sushi spot on Park Avenue South, will open a branch with a rooftop cafe, Sushi Samba 7, at 87 Seventh Avenue South.</p>
        <p>Also in a few months, Chazal, a French-Mediterranean place owned by Alain Chevreux of Ferrier and Roberto Ruggeri of Bice, is to replace La Terraza, at 41 Madison Avenue (26th Street).</p>
