        <p>When word got out recently that two radiology centers in Portland, Ore., were offering a new screening test for the early detection of lung cancer, the response was overwhelming. Smokers and former smokers jammed the centers' phones, demanding the simple, painless test that can find lung cancers so tiny that they can be snipped out and, doctors hope, the patients cured.</p>
        <p>In a single day, more than 300 people called one of the centers, Epic Imaging. ''I got in at 6:30 that morning and didn't get off the phone until 6:30 that night,'' said Melanie Haymond, a marketing director there.</p>
        <p>Drawn by newspaper articles and Epic's brochures describing the test as ''fast, inexpensive, lifesaving,'' patients readily agreed to Epic's  $295 fee, even though the test is not covered by most health insurance policies because it is considered experimental. They even agreed to pay half of the money at the time of the test, as Epic required.</p>
        <p>Such responses are being repeated throughout the country as more and more radiologists begin advertising  the lung cancer screening test. The procedure is done with a powerful new X-ray machine, a spiral CT scanner, which can detect tumors many times smaller than those found with a conventional chest X-ray.</p>
        <p>Cancer experts agree that there is an urgent need to improve the prospects for patients with lung cancer.</p>
        <p>But it is unclear whether more people will be harmed than helped by the test because the scanner's effectiveness has never been rigorously tested. One early study has found that 9 of every 10 patients who have suspicious test findings will not have cancer -- but they will have to have additional expensive tests, and sometimes surgery, to find that out. For the rest there are three possibilities. Some may be cured when surgeons snip out their tumors. Others may have tumors that may turn out not to have been dangerous after all, but they still would have undergone treatments as though their lives were threatened. And still others may have tiny tumors that turn out to be incurable despite the treatments.</p>
        <p>These are questions that researchers say are going to occur more often as science is rapidly making it possible to find a variety of diseases at earlier and earlier stages.</p>
        <p>Lung cancer is the nation's leading cause of cancer deaths, killing about 157,000 Americans every year, more  than colon, breast, prostate and uterine cancers combined. Lung cancer is diagnosed in about 164,000 people  each year, but the five-year survival rate is just 14 percent -- virtually the same as it was 30 years ago.</p>
        <p>The earlier that diseases are found, the less that is known about their likely course and the more difficult the questions. Molecular tests are being developed for bladder cancer and colon cancer, for example, that would look for individual genes that go awry, long before any tumors are evident. Scientists are working on scanning tests for early Alzheimer's disease and on ever more precise ways of finding very early breast cancer.</p>
        <p>But seldom have the stakes been so high and the choices so stark as with the new lung cancer test. The cost of testing all current and former smokers with the lung scanner would be immense -- more than $39 billion, according to the National Cancer Institute. Yet if the test works, it could save hundreds of thousands of lives and alleviate terrible suffering.</p>
        <p>''It has become a huge debate,'' said Dr. Jonathan Goldin, a radiologist at the University of California in Los Angeles. ''There's an academic interest, there's a health policy interest, there's a highly emotional desire to do good for patients. And then there's an economic interest -- you can make a fair amount of money right now if you opened up a spiral scanner and said, 'Let's go for it.' ''</p>
        <p>Is Early Detection Good?</p>
        <p>The idea of using the spiral CT scanners to find early lung cancers began with an iconoclast, Dr. Claudia L. Henschke, the division chief of chest imaging at Weill Cornell Medical Center of New York Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. She knew that most scientists dismissed lung cancer screening as useless. Doctors could find the cancer early with chest X-rays. But studies indicated that the lives of these patients had  not been prolonged.</p>
        <p>Dr. Henschke wondered whether advances in technology might have changed the prospects for lung cancer screening. A new generation of X-ray machines, the spiral CT, or computerized tomography, scanners, could show nodules as small as the diameter of a soda straw, compared with the the quarter-size tumors that were seen with chest X-rays. Could it be, Dr. Henschke asked, that the spiral scanners, already widely used by radiologists,  could find lung cancers so early that they could be cured?</p>
        <p>That was in 1991. ''No one was willing to talk about it,'' Dr. Henschke said. ''They said it's a dead issue.''</p>
        <p>Despite the skeptics, Dr. Henschke organized a study of 1,000 smokers and former smokers, examining each person's lungs with both spiral CT scans and with conventional chest X-rays and comparing what the two machines found. When the radiologists saw very small nodules, they asked the patients to come back  in a few months to see if the nodules were growing. If a nodule grew, patients needed more tests, sometimes involving surgery, to see if it was cancerous.</p>
        <p>With the spiral CT scans, 23 percent of the people had suspicious nodules but only 2.7 percent of them turned out to have cancer. Almost all the tumors were in Stage 1, meaning they had not yet spread. Chest X-rays found suspicious nodules in 7 percent of the people but only 0.7 percent of them had cancer. Half of the tumors were in Stage 1. The rest were more advanced.</p>
        <p>Dr. Henschke's paper was published in a British medical journal, The Lancet, last July 10 and reported widely in the news media, setting off a groundswell of demand for the test because she showed that lung cancer could be detected early, and a rush by radiologists to offer it.</p>
        <p>At Cornell, Dr. Henschke said, smokers and former smokers mobbed the hospital lobby, refusing to leave without spiral CT scanning tests. Over the next six months, radiologists across the country began advertising the scanning tests for lung cancer.</p>
        <p>The University Radiology Group in New Brunswick, N.J., began advertising its $295 test on the radio and in newspapers in December, drawing 200 patients. ''We already had the scanner, so it was not a big deal,'' said Dr. Judith Korek Amorosa, a radiologist there.</p>
        <p>The Arizona Heart Institute in Phoenix began advertising its $500 test in December, bringing in 300 people so far, said Jeannie Swindle,  the vice president for marketing there. The institute even offers specials, such as the one it had in May, when it reduced its price by more than $100, Ms. Swindle said.</p>
        <p>Many who had the lung scans were delighted. Kenneth MacWilliams, a 63-year-old investment banker in Dumont, N.J., went to Dr. Henschke's office for a test last year because he had breathed other peoples' smoke  at work. His scan showed no signs of tumors.</p>
        <p>''There is absolutely no downside for me,'' Mr. MacWilliams said. ''Why would I not want to do this?''</p>
        <p>But as the lung scans are being  promoted, one gap in the logic remains. Dr. Henschke's study had shown that spiral CT scanners could find tiny lung cancers. What it did not show was whether finding them saved lives. And that is fueling the bitter debate over how much evidence of that is necessary.</p>
        <p>''It's the fundamental question,'' said Dr. David F. Yankelevitz, Dr. Henschke's colleague at Cornell. ''These are critical issues, and it's a discussion that needs to happen.''</p>
        <p>A Questionable Study</p>
        <p>Dr. Henschke cannot convince herself that there is much more to ask. She knows the hypothetical problems with early detection, but she does not believe they apply to lung cancer.</p>
        <p>''Logically, we know you can cure cancer only when you get it at an early stage,'' Dr. Henschke said. ''CT gets it much much earlier. The only thing that has to be documented is how many lives are saved.''</p>
        <p>The orthodox way to find out is to randomly assign patients to have the lung scanning test, or not, and then compare outcomes. If more people die in the unscreened group, it can be concluded that the test is saving lives.</p>
        <p>But, Dr. Henschke asks, how many people are going to enroll in such a study? Who would forgo a simple, painless test that could find cancer early? And even if people did agree, would they hold off having a lung scan for more than a decade while the study wound its way to a conclusion?</p>
        <p>''Down the line, more and more people are going to be convinced'' of the effectiveness of the test, Dr. Henschke said. ''What do you do when your neighbor has a CT scan and it detects a nodule and the nodule is cured?''</p>
        <p>So what Dr. Henschke is planning  is almost scientific apostasy -- a study in which everyone gets a CT scan.</p>
        <p>The researchers will use statistical analyses to decide how much better people fared than they would have if they had not received the screening test.</p>
        <p>Dr. Henschke said she could not conduct the study any other way. She said she had seen too many patients with tiny cancerous tumors that were removed and did not return, and too many who had no screening and whose tumors were found too late. She could not conceive of waiting well over a decade for a randomized clinical trial to enroll patients, screen them and follow them as the study wound to a close.</p>
        <p>''How many lives will you be losing?'' Dr. Henschke said. ''If there are 160,000 people who die from lung cancer each year, you could save a lot of lives during that trial -- certainly over 100,000 from my best estimate,'' she said, calculating what she thought would be the number of lives saved over the course of the 10-year study.</p>
        <p>Need for Answers</p>
        <p>Dr. Barnett Kramer of the National Institutes of Health, knows the emotional pull of patients' stories, and he knows that when it comes to arguing about lung cancer scans, he is at a disadvantage. He does not do the scans and must rely instead on cold logic and reasoning. But he does look at data, and at recent medical history. And he is very worried about the rapid spread of spiral CT screening for lung cancer.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kramer remembers the last time that doctors thought they had a way of preventing lung cancer deaths. During the 1960's and 1970's, many recommended that smokers and former smokers have regular X-rays, and some also ordered tests of their sputum to look for cancer.</p>
        <p>Finally, researchers managed to do large clinical trials that asked whether such screenings saved lives. The results were eye-opening. Although more cancers were found in the screened group, and at earlier stages, the screenings did nothing to cut the death rate from lung cancer.</p>
        <p>In 1989, Dr. David Eddy, who is an independent consultant and an adviser to Kaiser Permanente, Southern California, summed up the situation in a paper in the Annals of Internal Medicine. ''It is important to emphasize that these conclusions are not based on a lack of evidence of an effect,'' Dr. Eddy wrote, ''but are based on good evidence that there is no effect.''</p>
        <p>For Dr. Kramer, it was a valuable lesson.</p>
        <p>''This is the classic case,'' Dr. Kramer said. ''You were picking up cancers that would not have killed the patients, and you were curing people who did not need to be cured. In exchange you were doing a lot more surgery.''</p>
        <p>The cancer institute hopes to do a large definitive study involving at least 20,000 people who would be randomly assigned to have a CT scan or, for comparison, to forgo it.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kramer is optimistic that once the uncertainties of the lung scan are explained, people will volunteer for the study.</p>
        <p>For now, medical experts said, the nation is poised at a critical moment when a decision on how to proceed can reverberate for years to come.</p>
        <p>''Certainly, there is no question that spiral CT is a promising technology,'' said Dr. Paul S. Frame, a family practitioner in Cohocton, N.Y., who is reviewing the scanner as a member of the United States Preventive Services Task Force, which makes recommendations on screenings. ''But the fear and the caution is that our society is geared to like miracles. And when somebody mentions a miracle, nobody wants to wait around and see if it's true. That's the dilemma we're in.''</p>
