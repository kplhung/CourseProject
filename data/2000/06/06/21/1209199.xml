        <p>Jat Hewitt letter on R W Apple Jr's June 7 article on England's gastro pubs fears threat to pub as place where men of different classes can drink and socialize together</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>R. W. Apple's article about gastro pubs in England (''News Down at the Pub: Good Food, for One Thing,'' June 7) was distressing to me. Although I am sure many of these gourmet inns serve excellent food, I am also sure that this signals the end of a great British institution, a place where ''rheumy old men'' and ''young louts'' could drink and socialize together and the renowned class system in England was forgotten.</p>
        <p>Both my father and father-in-law frequented these pubs, not so much to drink, but to visit after retirement and talk to friends and neighbors.  They did not sit there ''to drink away their disappointments,'' but they did enjoy the camaraderie of others when otherwise they might have been isolated at home watching the television. Maybe senior citizens in America could benefit from such outdated institutions!</p>

        <p>It will be a very sad day when I return home and go to the local and have to eat quail or souffle instead of bangers and mash or a salad with ''sweet runny mayonnaise,'' which we call salad cream and happen to love!</p>
