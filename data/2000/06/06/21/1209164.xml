        <p>In an area often regarded as the cradle of the digital revolution, Gov. George W. Bush warned today that American schoolchildren were not being adequately prepared for the demands of jobs in high technology, and he proposed spending an additional $2.3 billion over five years in federal funds to improve math and science education in public schools.</p>
        <p>''I know we can do better,'' Mr. Bush told educators at De Anza College here in the heart of the Silicon Valley. The Texas governor frequently cited tests of children in 21 countries, including the United States, as yardsticks of just how much room for improvement there was.</p>

        <p>In an area often regarded as the cradle of the digital revolution, Gov. George W. Bush warned today that American schoolchildren were not being adequately prepared for the demands of jobs in high technology, and he proposed spending an additional $2.3 billion over five years in federal funds to improve math and science education in public schools.</p>
        <p>''I know we can do better,'' Mr. Bush told educators at De Anza College here in the heart of the Silicon Valley. The Texas governor frequently cited tests of children in 21 countries, including the United States, as yardsticks of just how much room for improvement there was.</p>
        <p>''This is America,'' Mr. Bush said. ''There's no reason for us to be next to last in math. There's no reason for us to be last in physics. We're the greatest country in the world. We ought to be first.''</p>
        <p>Beyond those exhortations to greatness, however, Mr. Bush talked little about the proposals he was making, which were spelled out instead in documents distributed by his aides. These plans were the latest in a series of education initiatives that Mr. Bush has made over the last three months, and they reflected his focus on education as an issue with which he can appeal to moderate voters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, called for the federal government to spend an additional $1 billion over five years on the establishment of a Math and Science Partnership Fund to encourage universities and colleges to interact with public schools in ways that enhanced math and science instruction for children in kindergarten through the 12th grade.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush proposed an additional $1 billion over five years to increase the value of the federal Pell grants that are given to low-income students to defray the cost of college education. Under the governor's plan, young people who have taken college-level math or science courses in high school can qualify for a grant that would be worth an additional $1,000. The average Pell grant, Mr. Bush's aides said, is worth about $3,000.</p>
        <p>Finally, Mr. Bush called for an additional $345 million over five years to encourage college graduates who majored in science or math to spend at least five years teaching in public schools in needy areas. Under current federal programs, graduates who do this can have $5,000 of their student loans forgiven or paid by the federal government. Mr. Bush would expand this amount to $17,500.</p>
        <p>But the governor was not merely articulating new policy today; he was spending time in a state that has tilted heavily Democratic over the last few years, but that he does not want to cede to Vice President Al Gore in the general election.</p>
        <p>California has more electoral votes, 54, than any other state, and Mr. Bush's trip here this week, which began on Monday and is scheduled to end on Wednesday, was his fourth swing through the state since the primary here on March 7.</p>
        <p>A statewide poll conducted by the Field organization and made public today showed Mr. Bush trailing Mr. Gore by 11 points, 46 percent to 35 percent, but several previous polls have portrayed a tighter race. Several times this week, Mr. Bush insisted that he could compete successfully in California by appealing to Hispanic voters, promoting his education plans and convincing people in the Silicon Valley that his economic and trade policies would benefit them.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Bush would describe himself as a fiscal conservative, he has proposed spending billions of dollars in new federal money for education since the campaign began. Mr. Gore has proposed spending an even larger amount, and one of the educators with whom Mr. Bush met here today seemed to suggest that Mr. Bush could be more generous.</p>
        <p>In a decidedly unscripted moment, Barbara Illowsky, a math professor at De Anza College, told Mr. Bush that it would be terrific if he ''were able to raise as much money for education'' as he had for his presidential campaign and the Republican Party.</p>
