        <p>Stocks were mixed yesterday as concerns about corporate profit growth hurt old-line manufacturing concerns even as enthusiasm about the earnings prospects for technology companies continued to rise.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones industrial average, composed of many old economy names, fell 122.68 points, or 1.2 percent, to 10,435.16. The decline, which was led by General Motors and Honeywell, wiped out Monday's advance of 108.54 points.</p>
        <p>But the Nasdaq composite index rose for a fourth consecutive session. Fueled by gains in stocks like Intel, Yahoo and Apple Computer, the index gained 23.53, or 0.6 percent, to 4,013.36. It was the first time in more than two months that the Nasdaq has closed above 4,000. The index remains far below its March 10 record of 5,048.62. But with its recent recovery, the index is now down just 1.4 percent this year.</p>
        <p>''You have to be impressed by the continued recovery of technology stocks, both large and small cap, and the deterioration of the old-economy issues,'' said James Paulson, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management.</p>
        <p>''But there is still a sense we are caught in a box: either the economy is slowing much faster than anyone expects, which is a negative, or the Fed is not finished tightening because the economy is still growing strongly.''</p>
        <p>The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index slipped 10.05, or 0.7 percent, to 1,475.95, as weakness in stocks like Tyco International and Cisco Systems more than offset gains in America Online, Time Warner and Oracle.</p>
        <p>After the market closed, Oracle, the world's biggest maker of database software, reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street's  estimates.</p>
        <p>Despite the results, the stock, which closed yesterday at 86 3/64 , up 3/64 , fell after hours to as low as 83.</p>
        <p>Bad earnings news hurt G.M. after the company said its North American operations would miss profit margin goals because of declining car prices. And Honeywell fell sharply for a second day after saying earnings would fall short of estimates.</p>
        <p>G.M. slumped 2 13/16 , to 62 1/16 . Honeywell dropped 3 7/8, to a 52-week low of 36 3/8. In the last two trading sessions, Honeywell's stock price has fallen more than 25 percent.</p>
        <p>The announcement from G.M. pulled down the other automakers. Ford Motor fell 1 7/8, to 43, and DaimlerChrysler lost 1 1/16 , to 54 3/16 .</p>
        <p>''Earnings preannouncements have been holding the market back,'' said Bryan Piskorowski, a market analyst at Prudential Securities.  ''But we have not had a major technology bellwether preannounce an earnings shortfall, and that has allowed the Nasdaq to resume its leadership role. As we muddle our way through to earnings season, there is room on the upside, even if the Federal Reserve Board raises short-term interest rates by one-quarter of a percentage point.''</p>
        <p>Intel and Micron Technology were among the technology stocks that helped lead the group's advance. Intel, which soared on Monday, gained an additional 1 13/16  yesterday, to  close at 138 5/16 . And Micron rose 9, to 89 3/8.</p>
        <p>Brokerage stocks did better on unexpected strength in second-quarter earnings from Goldman Sachs,  whose results beat Wall Street expectations. After an early rally, its shares closed at 89, down 2 5/8. But the results helped push up Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's stock 2 1/8, to 86 9/16 . And Merrill Lynch rose 3 1/2, to 122.</p>

        <p>Treasury Prices Fall</p>
        <p>By The Associated Press</p>
        <p>Bonds prices fell yesterday in quiet trading, as investors turned skittish ahead of next week's Federal Reserve meeting.</p>
        <p>The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 1/32 , to 105. The bond's yield was essentially unchanged at 5.89 percent.</p>
        <p>The price of the 10-year Treasury note fell 4/32 , to 103 17/32 . The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.01 percent from 5.99 percent on Monday.</p>
