        <p>Vice President Al Gore set his case today for government-subsidized savings accounts, saying his plan would help families build wealth for retirement and other uses without putting their guaranteed Social Security benefits at risk in the stock market.</p>
        <p>Seeking to contrast his approach to Gov. George W. Bush's proposal to create personal investment accounts within the Social Security system, Mr. Gore said his plan would encourage lower- and middle-income people to save by adding a program to supplement Social Security.</p>
        <p>In a speech, the tone of which could have been heard either as robust populism or class warfare, Mr. Gore said his plan was intended not just for people ''who think comfortably about their savings over Scotch in the club looking out at the golf links, but also the ones who carefully try to make it all add up to the dream over a pressured half-hour break on the factory floor.''</p>
        <p>The appearance before a group of Democrats here was the latest in his effort to focus the presidential race on the strong economy and how best to apportion the budget surplus.</p>
        <p>In political terms, it gave Mr. Gore an opportunity to present a positive alternative to Mr. Bush's proposal to allow workers to invest a portion of their Social Security payroll taxes in the stock market. And in economic terms it addressed one of the nation's biggest weaknesses, the low rate of personal savings.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore changed plans immediately after the speech, postponing until Wednesday a trip to Des Moines and instead flying to Washington in case his vote was needed in the Senate to break a tie over hate-crimes legislation backed by the Clinton administration. In the end, Mr. Gore's vote was not needed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's savings plan is built around providing matching funds, through tax credits, for people who put money away in a type of savings account that would be modeled after an Individual Retirement Account. The plan, which would become effective gradually over 10 years, would give more substantial credits to people at the low end of the income spectrum, and would phase out for people at higher income levels.</p>
        <p>Contributions to the accounts would be tax deductible, and investment earnings would build tax free. The money would be taxed on withdrawal. While the accounts would be intended for retirement savings, the money could also be used to pay for college tuition, a first home or catastrophic medical expenses.</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign said the plan would cost about $200 billion over 10 years, making it one of the largest single initiatives proposed by the vice president this year.</p>
        <p>The Bush campaign said Mr. Gore's proposal followed Mr. Bush's lead in acknowledging the attractiveness of allowing workers to invest for retirement, but was otherwise flawed.</p>
        <p>''Low-income workers living paycheck to paycheck cannot afford it, and it doesn't stop Social Security from going broke,'' said Ari Fleischer, Mr. Bush's spokesman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore continued his attack on Mr. Bush's investment-based approach, saying it could drive the budget back into deficit, undermine the nation's prosperity and penalize ''the elderly people who happen to be on the losing end of a roll of the dice.''</p>
        <p>But most of the vice president's speech today sought to portray his plan as a gateway to wealth, security and opportunity for people who have historically had trouble putting aside any substantial amounts of money in savings. He cast the issue in terms of what happened to his childhood friends from two different places.</p>
        <p>''The ones I went to school with in Washington, D.C., came mostly from well-to-do families wth enough money to send them to college and stake them to a good start,'' he said. ''And most of them have done well in life.</p>
        <p>''The ones I spent my summers with in Carthage, Tenn., were at least as smart, but their families weren't nearly as well off,'' he said. ''And I saw the opportunity gap open, and widen, and there were times when it broke my heart. They deserve more than they got. And I'll be damned if I'm going to let that injustice continue.''</p>
        <p>In emphasizing his proposal's appeal to lower- and middle-income residents, Mr. Gore drew an implicit comparison to Mr. Bush's plan. Mr. Bush's approach is built around a large tax cut whose benefits would go largely to people who pay the most taxes, the wealthy, and his Social Security plan, which seeks to appeal to what Republicans see as a large new investor class that encompasses many middle-income people.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's plan has its roots in a proposal first offered by President Clinton two years ago. Under the Clinton plan, low- and moderate-income savers would not only have received matching funds from the government, but they would also have received an upfront payment to get their savings accounts going.</p>
        <p>The Gore plan, which would be voluntary, would not offer any upfront payment, and it is unclear how much new savings the program would stimulate, especially among low-income households.</p>
        <p>It would offer matching funds for deposits made into the accounts, with the amount of the match dependent on income. A couple making as much as $30,000 a year, for example, could each receive a $3 for $1 match of deposits up to $500 a year; for their $500, each person would receive another $1,500 through a tax credit, giving the account a total value at the end of the year of $2,000.</p>
        <p>A couple making up to $60,000 would receive a $1 for $1 match of their deposits up to $1,000 each. A couple earning as much as $100,000 a year could contribute up to $1,500, and receive a match of $1 for every $3 they deposit.</p>
        <p>The accounts would be administered by banks, brokerage firms and other financial institutions, and would be limited to offering mutual funds and other broad-based investments rather than individual stocks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore is expected to announce on Wednesday his support for modest reductions in the federal estate tax to help farmers and small-business owners.</p>
