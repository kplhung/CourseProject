        <p>With gasoline prices in the Midwest surging past $2 a gallon, Gov. Frank L. O'Bannon of Indiana today suspended the state's gas tax for two months and warned that he may seek an inquiry into possible price gouging by oil companies.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Bannon, who said the tax break would reduce the price of gasoline in Indiana by as much as 10 cents a gallon, demanded to know why gas stations in the state are charging record prices, exceeding the national average by as much as 50 cents a gallon.</p>

        <p>With gasoline prices in the Midwest surging past $2 a gallon, Gov. Frank L. O'Bannon of Indiana today suspended the state's gas tax for two months and warned that he may seek an inquiry into possible price gouging by oil companies.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Bannon, who said the tax break would reduce the price of gasoline in Indiana by as much as 10 cents a gallon, demanded to know why gas stations in the state are charging record prices, exceeding the national average by as much as 50 cents a gallon.</p>
        <p>The move came as the Federal Trade Commission opened an investigation into the higher prices, which have drivers in Chicago paying an average of $2.13 a gallon, a 55 percent increase since January.</p>
        <p>''Hoosiers can't afford to wait on federal and state investigators to tell us why the Midwest is being hit so hard,'' Mr. O'Bannon said.</p>
        <p>If prices do not fall soon, the governor said, he will ask the state attorney general to investigate.</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore said in Lexington, Ky., today that profit reported by oil companies earlier this year suggested that ''big oil is gouging American consumers.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, the presumptive Democratic candidate for president, said he was seeking to have the governors of states most affected by the higher price meet with Energy Secretary Bill Richardson and Carol Browner, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
        <p>The governors and administration officials should work together to determine whether the oil companies are fixing prices or otherwise colluding, Mr. Gore said.</p>
        <p>Oil industry experts have attributed the rising prices to limited supplies, the disruption of a pipeline in Michigan and a new federal environmental requirement that regions with significant air pollution sell cleaner-burning fuel.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A. last week said it would consider a request by Gov. George Ryan of Illinois to waive rules that have required dealers in the state to sell gasoline with less polluting additives, like ethanol, beginning this month.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ryan had accused the environmental agency of failing to consider the impact of the new requirement.</p>
        <p>But federal officials said there were few indications that the anti-pollution requirement was to blame for the price increases, especially since the stock of reformulated gasoline is sufficient and oil companies have had five years to prepare for the change.</p>
        <p>Representative Jan Schakowsky, Democrat of Illinois, accused the oil companies of gouging consumers in Chicago and Milwaukee in retaliation for the new rules on additives.</p>
        <p>Congressional officials said that Robert Pitofsky, the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, told members of the Illinois Congressional delegation today that price surges in some Midwestern cities raised enough questions to warrant the inquiry.</p>
        <p>The trade commission will issue subpoenas for testimony from oil executives beginning next week, the officials said. The investigation, which could take as six weeks, will be conducted by the agency's Bureau of Competition, which has already been looking into whether higher prices in California is a result of collusion between refiners or distributors.</p>
        <p>Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, told The Associated Press that the investigation in the Midwest would send ''a clear signal to the oil companies to bring down prices immediately.''</p>
