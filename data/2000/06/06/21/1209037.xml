        <p>THE sun has set on the British Empire, but not on a handful of products that followed the Union Jack overseas. Colman's mustard, Gilbey's gin and Lipton's tea remain familiar in English-speaking countries and many others, and Lea &amp; Perrins Worcestershire Sauce is as ubiquitous as taxes.</p>
        <p>Lea &amp; Perrins bottles, with their characteristic long necks, designed to make it easy to Shake Well Before Using, have turned up in shipwrecks, encrusted with barnacles; in the forbidden city of Lhasa, Tibet; and in the excavations at Te Wairo, New Zealand, which was buried by a volcanic eruption in 1886. I came across one during the Vietnam War in a semi-defunct colonial hotel in Dalat and another in a bar in Samarkand in what was then Soviet Central Asia.</p>
        <p>Very few food products have been made to the same formula for so long. Lea &amp; Perrins Worcestershire was first formulated in 1835. Its name was registered as a trademark in 1892, and it has been manufactured since 1897 in a handsome red-brick Victorian factory on Midland Road in Worcester, a mile from the city's fine medieval cathedral and 125 miles northwest of London.</p>
        <p>As early as 1848, a batch of old letters in the company archives show, crates of the sauce were dispatched to Gibraltar, Malta, Singapore, India, Australia and New Zealand, Mauritius, South Africa, Argentina, Chile, Peru, Canada and Jamaica, and in the United States, to New Orleans and Cincinnati.</p>
        <p>Today, 25 million bottles a year are produced here and shipped around the world. Sauce concentrate is shipped to other countries, to be diluted and bottled there, and the stuff is made from scratch in Fair Lawn, N.J., in a plant where 10 employees won brief fame in 1996 by hitting the lottery for $14.3 million. The formula is the same everywhere, unlike that for Coca-Cola, which adapts its recipe to suit local variations in taste.</p>
        <p>In all, Lea &amp; Perrins Worcestershire is sold in 140 countries. Not even the tribulations of wartime have interrupted the cascade of condiments. A bombing raid during World War II resulted in the temporary disappearance of the familiar orange-and-brown labels, but not of the bottles; they continued to roll off the line, in the standard 5- and 10-ounce sizes, bearing utilitarian, black-and-white labels that announced, ''Messrs. Lea &amp; Perrins are compelled to issue this label owing to the destruction of their printer's establishment by enemy action.'' What phlegm! What stiff upper lips!</p>
        <p>There are other manufacturers of Worcestershire sauce, of course. It is one of Heinz's many varieties. But as Dave Clements, 35, the good-humored factory general manager for Lea &amp; Perrins, asked me when I visited the plant, ''If Heinz does it better than we do, why isn't it called Pennsylvania sauce?'' Besides, a British high court ruled in 1906 that while anyone could call a sauce Worcestershire, no matter where it was made, only Lea &amp; Perrins could use the words ''original and genuine'' to describe its product.</p>
        <p>It is hard to escape the conviction that early on, before the invention of refrigeration, Worcestershire sauce was used to compensate for culinary ineptitude and ingredients that had passed their prime. Raymond Postgate, the founder of the ''Good Food Guide,'' said of Worcestershire and its bottled brethren, ''They were provided on the justified assumption that you would want to hide completely the taste of what you would be offered to eat.''</p>
        <p>The sauce is all but indestructible, whether by heat, cold or time, which made it a welcome companion on long sea voyages. But its flavor -- it is piquant, salty, vinegary, slightly fishy and perhaps vaguely fruity -- also had a broad appeal that has never waned.</p>
        <p>FOR Americans, it is perhaps best known as an indispensable ingredient in the Bloody Mary, a cocktail perfected in the 1920's at Harry's New York Bar in Paris by Fernand Petiot, the head bartender. Worcestershire sauce is also a popular seasoning for steaks and a must in Welsh rarebit, the classic end-of-meal savory, out of style but never, at least in my house, out of mind.</p>
        <p>The United States uses more Worcestershire sauce than any other country. Other strokes for other folks: In Japan, it is widely used as a soy substitute, with sushi and other dishes. In New Zealand, the largest consumer of Worcestershire sauce per capita, it for many years relieved the monotony of a diet overladen with lamb. El Salvador, for reasons that make officials here scratch their heads, consumes 450 tons of sauce every year -- 2.5 ounces for every man, woman and child in that little Central American nation -- and has spawned counterfeit labels seeking to mimic Lea &amp; Perrins.</p>
        <p>A few epicures may turn up their noses, and Worcestershire sauce gets no entry in the ''Larousse Gastronomique.'' But it has plenty of defenders.</p>
        <p>''It is a valuable flavoring when used with skill and moderation,'' writes Tom Stobart in ''Herbs, Spices and Flavorings'' (Overlook Press, $16.95). ''Cooks do better to steer clear of made-up flavorings, but an item which has been popular and unchanged for over a century, and is used by chefs in so many countries, must be an exception. Indeed, one could almost say that it has graduated as a basic natural ingredient.''</p>
        <p>The sap of the wonderful Worcestershire tree, you might suppose. No, not really. So what actually goes into the sauce? How is it made? In keeping with long-standing tradition, Mr. Clements was willing to explain just so much and no more. The ingredients are stated on the label: vinegar, molasses, sugar, salt, anchovies, tamarinds, onions, garlic, spices and ''flavoring.''</p>
        <p>Those last three words hide more than they reveal; I was able to pry nothing more specific from Mr. Clements than the fact that there are chilies and cloves in the mix and one ''secret ingredient'' as well.</p>
        <p>''If I told you what it was,'' he said, putting on his best mock-M.I. 5 cloak, ''I would have to shoot you.''</p>
        <p>Ginger, perhaps? Sassafras? Elixir of bus driver's glove? Something as mundane as soy? Another tropical fruit to complement the tamarind?</p>
        <p>Worcestershire sauce is an advertisement for free trade, in its manufacture as well as its distribution. The anchovies come from Spain, Italy or sometimes Morocco. The cloves come from Southeast Asia or Zanzibar, the garlic and chilies from China and the tamarinds -- dark brown pods containing a juice widely used as a souring agent -- from northeastern India.</p>
        <p>Each major ingredient is treated separately. The anchovies are preserved in salt, for example, and aged for three to five years, in a process similar to that which produces nam pla fish sauce in Thailand, while the vegetables are pickled in vinegar. All are stored in small blue barrels, which are labeled with the name of the ingredient and the date. One that I spotted said ''Pickles, 1997 season, shallots, 100 kilograms, malt vinegar, 100 kilograms.''</p>
        <p>At the appropriate moment, the aged and unaged ingredients are combined in huge fiberglass maturing tanks, holding up to 30,000 liters each (more than 7,000 gallons). These have replaced more romantic but less manageable oak casks. The mixture is never cooked (though it is heated just before bottling to pasteurize it). It just sits there, perfuming the air with an acrid smell. A stroll through a cellar filled with wine vats evokes a smile; here in Worcester, a walk through the mixing room is more likely to produce a cough or sneeze.</p>
        <p>After several months -- Lea &amp; Perrins has never divulged the exact length of time -- the solids are filtered from the brew, and it is bottled.</p>
        <p>Secrecy has always been big at Lea &amp; Perrins. Once, when a foreign government demanded a list of ingredients for all imported food products, the firm laid plans to supply it with a fraudulent formula, which excluded the ''secret ingredient'' and included spurious ones. At one time, the ingredients had code names, known to a few, beginning with the letter B -- Bulimay, Buggy, Bugbear, Bugler, Building, Bulldog, Buglehorn, Bullcalf, Bullace and Bulletin, but no Birdseed.</p>
        <p>T HE consequence of decades of caution -- dare one say paranoia? -- is that no one knows how the sauce originated. Legend, handed from generation to generation, has it that a Lord Sandys (presumably an ancestor of the Duncan Sandys who married one of Winston Churchill's daughters) came home from service as governor of Bengal, in India, with a recipe that he presented one spring day in 1835 to the proprietors of the Lea &amp; Perrins shop in Broad Street, Worcester.</p>
        <p>''Make it up,'' he said, and they did. But when they tasted it, it was revolting, so they consigned it, in a stone crock, to the basement. There it languished, only to be rediscovered and retasted many months later. This time it bowled the partners over, and for years they presented their sauce as the product of a ''recipe of a nobleman in the county'' (Worcestershire).</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, from the perspective of the spinner of stories, a former Lea &amp; Perrins employee, Brian Keogh, found otherwise in the course of his research for ''The Secret Sauce,'' a history of the firm that was published privately in 1997 to mark the 100th anniversary of the Midland Road plant. ''No Lord Sandys,'' he wrote, ''was ever a governor of Bengal or, as far as available records show, ever in India.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clements winced when asked about the sauce's origins. Since Mr. Keogh's discoveries, he said, ''We have had to say that the saga of Lord Sandys may not be God's own truth.''</p>
        <p>Only 40 people work at the factory here, and only four or five know the formula. Each batch of sauce is made by one of two ''head makers'' -- either Malcolm Taylor or Joseph Neary, both longtime employees. Head maker, Mr. Clements said, is ''a position of enormous trust,'' because an unscrupulous individual privy to the firm's secrets could sell them to a rival. Until the late 1960's, head makers automatically became head magistrates of Worcester.</p>
        <p>John Wheeley Lea and William Henry Perrins, the firm's founders, and their descendants ranked among the city's leading figures, along with the composer Edward Elgar. Leas and Perrinses served as mayors of Worcester, and a Perrins rescued the Royal Worcester porcelain factory from ruin.</p>
        <p>Like the man who formulated Coca-Cola, John Stith Pemberton of Atlanta, Messrs. Lea and Perrins were chemists, or pharmacists. Their shop offered all manner of things, from surgeons' tools and leeches to Locock's Lotion for the Hair. And like Pemberton, Lea &amp; Perrins first touted the health-giving qualities of its tonic. Worcestershire sauce, an 1851 newspaper ad claimed, ''enables the stomach to perfectly digest the food,'' and thus ''the daily use of this aromatic and delicious sauce is the best safeguard to health.''</p>
        <p>Today's claims are more modest. ''Adds instant richness,'' the label on the Lea &amp; Perrins sauce asserts.</p>
        <p>Leas and Perrinses no longer run things. Lea &amp; Perrins was sold in 1930 to H. P. Foods Ltd., a company built around HP sauce, more famous in Britain than in the United States, which resembles A-1 Sauce. After reorganizations, H. P. Foods passed into the hands of the French Danone Group, which also makes Evian water, Dannon yogurt and Kronenbourg beer.</p>
        <p>But no Frenchman, people here whisper, has learned The Formula.</p>
