        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Student Prayers Must Be Private, Court Reaffirms'' (front page, June 20):</p>
        <p>Some will say it is the parents' role to teach religious beliefs, and I agree. But what about those children who come from a setting where guidelines for living life are not expressed?</p>
        <p>Much of our legal code has its foundations in ancient religious teachings like the Ten Commandments. How, then, can we as a society hold a young person who has never had an opportunity to learn the basics of what is right and wrong accountable for his actions?</p>
        <p>I am old enough to remember when each morning in public school, we listened while the teacher read something from the Bible. Regardless of our religious beliefs, no one appeared to be offended. In general, children and teenagers in those days were more respectful of each other and of adults; there certainly weren't students shooting students or teachers. Might there be a connection here?</p>
