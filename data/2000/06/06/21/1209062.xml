        <p>Five royal birthdays are to be feted at a gala given by Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle on Wednesday night, but the celebrator who is the hope for continuing generations of the beleaguered British monarchy will be marking his 18 years less ceremoniously.</p>
        <p>Final exam studies will keep Prince William in his Eton dormitory room, a 10-minute walk from the largest joint royal birthday party in memory. But his absence will hardly keep him and his official passing into adulthood from being the center of royal-watching attention.</p>
        <p>At a time when opinion surveys show enthusiasm for the reigning Windsors at an all-time low, the handsome 6-foot-2-inch prince with the shock of blond hair, cobalt blue eyes and downward-looking smile so reminiscent of his mother, Diana, is coming onto the scene as the family's best face forward.</p>
        <p>The black-tie event in the banquet hall beneath the crenelated towers of the hilltop castle formally celebrates the birthdays of the Queen Mother, 100 on Aug. 4; Princess Margaret, 70 on Aug. 21; Princess Anne, 50 on Aug. 15; Prince Andrew, 40 last Feb. 19; and William, 18 on Wednesday. The queen's 74th birthday also figured in this festive week, since the sovereign's official birthday was changed a century ago to a June date in hope of getting better weather for the commemorative trooping of the color in Horse Guards Parade in London -- with more than 1,200 marching soldiers in scarlet tunics, the biggest ceremonial display on the royal calendar. It took place Saturday.</p>
        <p>But aware that all interest centers on the coming of age of the winsome young prince destined to become king of England -- after his father, Prince Charles -- and eager to ensure that his privacy not be trespassed on, the press office of his father arranged the release of 14 photos, a short television film and an anodyne interview with Britain's domestic news agency, The Press Association. Though he has long shied away from self-promotion, William finds himself in the position of being  the best marketing opportunity now available to the family that calls itself The Firm.</p>
        <p>The portfolio, shot over six weeks last winter and personally approved by William, shows him dribbling a soccer ball on the famous playing fields of Eton, strolling moodily through the school's chapel cloisters, bobbing out of a pool in a water polo match, adjusting the flame under a skillet in a cookery class, surfing the Internet in a classmate's room, looking boy-band cute in a black turtleneck sweater, and checking the attendance of an arriving lower form boy as a member of the exclusive senior class prefect society known as Pop.</p>
        <p>Notably, there are no pictures of him pursuing his interest in hunting, shooting and military matters, no shots of him in the uniform of the Combined Cadet Force, which he took part in for years.</p>
        <p>The television film, shown over the weekend, contains the first recorded utterance of the second-in-line for the British throne when he is asked an offstage question about what he is cooking. Historians note. The words are, ''Paella with chicken, rice, garlic and beans.''</p>
        <p>In the question-and-answer interview, he discloses his irritation with overweening show business agents who try to draw attention to their clients by fantasizing romances with William. ''There's been a lot of nonsense put about by P.R. companies,'' he says. ''I don't like being exploited in this way, but, as I get older, it's increasingly hard to prevent.''</p>
        <p>William, a B-plus student with a busy extracurricular life, says throughout the interview that he has liked his five years at Eton, a marked departure from the experience of his father, who once called Gordonstoun, his spartan Scottish school, ''Colditz in kilts.''</p>
        <p>William intends to have his own party in 10 days at a local bistro, but Charles had to limit his 18th birthday celebration to inviting seven friends in for cakes and buns.</p>
        <p>On turning 18, William would normally be called His Royal Highness, be addressed as sir and be greeted with bows and curtsies, but the queen and his father have agreed to a request from him that those practices be postponed until he is finished with college.</p>
        <p>William is to take a traditional British ''gap year'' off for as-yet-unannounced world travels before going to college, where he intends to major in history of art. The schools that interest him do not include Oxford or Cambridge, his father's alma mater. He is expected to choose between two Scottish universities, Edinburgh and St. Andrews, and three English ones, Bristol, Durham and East Anglia.</p>
        <p>William's carefully managed emergence this week will be short-lived. Prince Charles has asked the press to continue to abide by the rules it adopted after the death of Diana in August 1997, under which William and his brother, Harry, 15, can be photographed only at arranged occasions, usually with their father.</p>
