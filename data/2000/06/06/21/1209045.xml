        <p>THE pastry chef at Esca, a new restaurant in the theater district, has thrown caution --  and half a sheet of gelatin -- to the wind. And that is why her panna cotta, an ethereal ivory-hued eggless custard held together mostly by determination, may be the most sublime in town.</p>
        <p>Panna cotta is a fragile marriage of sugar, cream and milk, bound by a variable but crucial amount of gelatin. Too much and you rubberize the texture; too little and this tenuous union simply collapses.</p>
        <p>In calculated defiance of the classic recipe for this northern Italian dessert, Meredith Kurtzman, Esca's pastry chef, cunningly reduced the usual quantity of gelatin -- not by much, but the small amount apparently was the key. Her careful experimentation resulted in an amazing texture somewhere between satin and sour cream.</p>
        <p>Panna cotta is judged by its ineffable smoothness, as is creme brulee. And its alluring quiver recalls other desserts whose appeal is their frailty, like wobbly flans. Tradition dictates rum or almond as a background flavor. But Esca's version uses an infusion of lemon peel and fragrant vanilla bean for a more complex perfume, and again against tradition, it comes with a hillock of cooked rhubarb and macerated strawberries.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kurtzman serves the custardy mixture in the sort of shallow bowls that might be used for creme brulee, so it has the appearance of having been baked. But her version is easily cooked on top of the stove, ladled into individual dishes and chilled. It is hard to imagine paying $7 for what in the initial stages of preparation looks like a saucer of milk for your cat. But after two hours' chilling, the gelatin performs its inevitable magic.</p>
        <p>Instead of the powdered gelatin familiar to most home cooks, restaurant chefs use quilted transparent sheets of pure protein, 2 3/4 inches by 9 inches, which crackle when broken. Sheet gelatin, available at specialty stores and even at butcher shops (where it is used in pates) is surprisingly easy to use. Soak it in ice water for five minutes, then wring it into a shapeless, jellyfishlike substance. Placed in hot liquid, it dissolves slowly, with no effort from the cook.</p>
        <p>But you need not rush out to buy gelatin sheets to make this dish, because a small amount of unflavored powdered gelatin, available in any supermarket, produces an equally beguiling panna cotta. Just hew to Esca's simple technique.</p>
        <p>LEMON PANNA COTTA  Adapted from Esca  Time: 40 minutes, plus 2 to 3 hours' refrigeration</p>
        <p>3 cups heavy cream  1 1/4 cups milk  1 vanilla bean, split, and seeds scraped  Zest of 8 lemons</p>
        <p>1/2 cup sugar  3 1/2 sheets gelatin (scant  1/2 ounce) or 2 1/2 teaspoons gelatin granules.</p>
        <p>1. Put cream, one cup milk, vanilla bean halves and seeds, and lemon zest in a medium saucepan. Simmer for 5 minutes, stirring often. Remove from heat, and allow to steep for 20 to 30 minutes.</p>
        <p>2. Strain lemon mixture through a fine-mesh strainer, and return to saucepan. Add sugar. Bring just to a boil over medium heat. Lower heat, and cook 2 minutes, stirring constantly, until sugar dissolves.</p>
        <p>3. If using sheet gelatin, snap sheets in half, and place in a bowl of ice water for 5 minutes. Gently heat remaining  1/4 cup milk in a small pan. Squeeze moisture out of gelatin, and stir into warm milk one sheet at a time, until gelatin is thoroughly dissolved. If using granules, sprinkle on top of the  1/4 cup milk in a small skillet, and let stand for 2 minutes. Gently heat, stirring constantly for 2 minutes, until gelatin dissolves.</p>
        <p>4. Stir gelatin into hot lemon cream. Place saucepan in a bowl of ice water, and stir constantly for 5 minutes, to make sure gelatin is evenly distributed.</p>
        <p>5. Pour mixture into shallow bowls, ramekins or custard cups. Refrigerate, uncovered, until just firm, about 2 to 3 hours. Best served within 24 hours.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 to 8 servings.</p>
