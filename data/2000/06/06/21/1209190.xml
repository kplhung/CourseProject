        <p>The Rev.

Corzine, the Democratic nominee, both of them waiting patiently for the bread and wine to be passed.</p>
        <p>''It just struck me how appropriate that this should happen in a church,'' said Mr. Rush, the pastor of Christ Church here. ''We are all different, but we are brought together in God's grace.''</p>

        <p>The Rev. Charles Rush had his flock gathered around the communion table recently when he noticed them: Bob Franks, the Republican nominee for the United States Senate, standing only a few shoulder-widths away from Jon S. Corzine, the Democratic nominee, both of them waiting patiently for the bread and wine to be passed.</p>
        <p>''It just struck me how appropriate that this should happen in a church,'' said Mr. Rush, the pastor of Christ Church here. ''We are all different, but we are brought together in God's grace.''</p>
        <p>Whether by grace or by happenstance, the two contenders for the seat being vacated by Senator Frank Lautenberg are practically neighbors here on the crest of the Watchung Mountains in central New Jersey, and both are regarded as local boys. Mr. Corzine, the multimillionaire bond trader and liberal Democrat, lives in the rich North Side, while Mr. Franks, the journeyman moderate who founded the Summit High School Young Republicans while he was in school, grew up here and now has a home in a kind of suburb of a suburb at Berkeley Heights, the next town over.</p>
        <p>Their proximity is both a source of local pride and a lesson in the evolving politics of New Jersey, a state that grows more suburban by the year and whose politics seem to be following the people out of old urban traditions into something new.</p>
        <p>After all, it was the two suburbanites, Mr. Corzine and Mr. Franks, who beat the Camden political brawler and former governor, Jim Florio, and the iron-jawed former marine, William L. Gormley, whose campaign was backed by Atlantic City casinos. And they did it, in part, by maintaining the kind of amiability that is prized in places like this, where you don't raise your voice too often.</p>
        <p>Summit is a hilltop city of about 20,000 with a high average family income and level of education. (For every resident with only a high school diploma, there are three with college or graduate degrees.)</p>
        <p>It is a relatively new place, founded around the turn of the century as a summer colony for sweltering New Yorkers, and it grew into a year-round community after World War II with the arrival of air-conditioning in the city and reliable commuter trains in the suburbs.</p>
        <p>For all their suburban diffidence and taste, the residents are too pleased to be able to hide their pride in being neighbors of both candidates. The Christ Church Web site announces the contenders' membership in the church, and neighborliness triumphed over party loyalty when several local Republicans, including the mayor, Walter Long, were in the audience when Mr. Corzine announced his candidacy.</p>
        <p>''The local Republicans went completely nuts when they saw I was there,'' Mr. Long said. ''But he's my friend, and I wanted to hear what he had to say.'' These days, the worst that a Democrat running for town council says of the Republicans who run the town is that they lack business sense.</p>
        <p>Republicans are equally polite. ''I've lived here for 12 years, and I call it the Disneyland of New Jersey,'' said Dr. Eric Munoz, a physician and Republican member of the town council. ''It has a lot of diversity, a lot of different characteristics, urban and suburban, but it all works together very well.''</p>
        <p>The regard for dignified moderation that money and comfortable living encourage is assumed to be shared by the two candidates.</p>
        <p>''In politics, we don't hear a lot about people we can look up to,'' Mr. Rush said. ''We live in the age of the antihero, where everybody is compromised. And yet here we have Jon and Bob, who have real integrity.'' Mr. Rush and others here believe that the boys of Summit are going to teach the rest of the state some lessons in manners.</p>
        <p>''They're going to take the high road in this campaign,'' he said. ''They just aren't negative people. Bob's usual disposition is to have this huge smile on his face, and Jon's natural disposition is to reach out and hug someone.''</p>
        <p>Of course, Mr. Corzine played some hardball in his primary battle with Mr. Florio, and political campaigners may not be as fond of gentlemanly conduct as Mr. Rush is.</p>
        <p>But so far, the harshest Mr. Franks has been with his opponent has been to say that Mr. Corzine, who spent approximately $35 million of his own money in the primary, will also be open-handed with the taxpayers' money. Mr. Corzine is on vacation and has said little in reply, which may account for Mayor Long's easy summer confidence that the race will be a boon to the area.</p>
        <p>''Having two men from Summit, N.J., step up to the plate and run for the U.S. Senate, that can only be good for this town,'' Mr. Long said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine's decision to take on the role of politician after a successful career on Wall Street has also been good for the Democrats here. As anyone will tell you, Summit is a business-oriented town, full of bankers and brokers who hop the New Jersey Transit Midtown Direct to Manhattan on weekday mornings, so it is a place that respects Mr. Corzine's business success. To have one of its richest and most successful citizens turn out to be a New Deal Democrat has done wonders for his party here.</p>
        <p>''The Democratic Party is blossoming with lots of new people and new meetings, and it's all because of Jon,'' said Michel Bitritto, a chemist in private industry. ''We've had meet-and-greets with Jon, we've made telephone calls. My husband and my daughter and I stood on the corner to get people to sign his ballot petitions. He's had a wonderful effect.''</p>
        <p>This fall, Ms. Bitritto will take a step no Democrat has done in Summit since the mid-1980's: she will run for town council on the Democratic line, with Mr. Corzine.</p>
        <p>Dr. Munoz is the chairman of the local Republican committee, and he was politely noncommittal in his assessment of Ms. Bitritto's chances of election. But he conceded that Mr. Corzine has helped revive Democratic fortunes here, and pointed to the results of the June 6 party primary, in which Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas were on the ballot.</p>
        <p>''Usually the Republicans outvote the Democrats by three or four to one,'' said Dr. Munoz, an assistant dean at the University for Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey in Newark. ''But in this primary, it was Bush 1,255 votes, Gore 1,235. For a city like Summit, with far more Republicans than Democrats, to have basically as many voters going for Gore as for Bush really says a lot about Corzine's local impact.''</p>
        <p>Now in the hazy summer, with some schools already closed and doctors and dentists closing early on Fridays, people like Mr. Rush and Mayor Long may believe that the good feelings they have for each candidate will continue into a quiet, uplifting, issues-oriented race.</p>
        <p>Dr. Munoz is not so sure. He said that there is going to be too much money flying around for tempers to stay calm for long.</p>
        <p>''We do have a tradition of very polite politics here,'' Dr. Munoz said, ''but when real contests start, we're not sure how polite we are anymore. So I'll bet you a dollar that when push comes to shove and November is getting closer, there are going to be some things said that are not going to be so nice, not as nice as everything is now.''</p>
