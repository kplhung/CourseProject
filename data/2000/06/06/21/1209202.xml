        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton asserted today that personal privacy was being threatened by businesses and medical institutions that routinely collect financial and medical records, and she urged Congress to give consumers control over how such information is used.</p>
        <p>And in a speech on privacy to broadcast executives, Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic candidate for United States Senate, scolded some New York City television stations for broadcasting videotapes of groups of men sexually assaulting women in Central Park nine days ago without obscuring the women's faces. Some  television stations, as well as most newspapers that reproduced still photographs from the videos, obscured the faces of the victims, as is  customary in most sexual crime cases.</p>
        <p>''There could not be a more dramatic example of the importance of privacy than those images,'' the first  lady told the New York State Broadcasters Association. ''I believe it was wrong to show the faces of the women being assaulted without getting their permission. You can report the news without adding to the trauma of those already victimized.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, noting First Amendment restrictions on regulating the press, said she was not proposing  legal measures to prevent the media from showing the faces of victims in such cases.</p>
        <p>She did call on Congress, however, to enact legislation to give consumers and patients control over health care and financial records, which she argued were becoming increasingly available because of computer databases and transmission of information through the Internet.</p>
        <p>''Individuals should have the right to choose whether and to whom their personal financial and medical information is disclosed,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''They should have the right to know how, when and how much of that information is being used. And they should have the right to see it for themselves to know if it is accurate.''</p>
        <p>With her remarks today, Mrs. Clinton introduced in her race against Representative Rick A. Lazio, a Suffolk County Republican, an issue that has gained increasing notice in campaigns across the nation this year. Mrs. Clinton's assistants asserted today that personal privacy had long been a concern of the first lady, and Mrs. Clinton said she would make ''the protection of citizen privacy in the information age a top priority'' if she were elected to the Senate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, through a spokesman, would not comment on Mrs. Clinton's remarks.</p>
        <p>For the most part, Mrs. Clinton offered her support for a variety of measures proposed in Congress,  which has shown increasing interest in this issue.</p>
        <p>On medical records, Mrs. Clinton urged Congress to adopt legislation that would require the consent of patients before records could be released by employers, health care institutions or insurers.</p>
        <p>''If we want to restore trust in the health care system, all Americans need to have confidence that their medical tests will be used to heal them, not deny them privacy, jobs or health coverage,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''What good are the best genetic tests and treatments in the world if people are too scared to use them?''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton also said businesses should be barred from distributing or selling information about the credit history, payment schedule, account balances and personal spending habits of consumers without obtaining their specific permission in advance.</p>
        <p>In making her argument, Mrs. Clinton made fleeting reference to her own adjustment to public life. ''Now I know when you enter public life you give up a lot of your privacy.  Believe me, I know that all too well.  But you shouldn't give up your privacy when you visit your doctor, take a trip to the video store or buy a book on the Internet.''</p>
