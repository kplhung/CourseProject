        <p>The trial judge in the Microsoft antitrust case unexpectedly delayed today the sweeping restrictions he had imposed on the company's conduct until a higher court affirms them.</p>
        <p>The restrictions on Microsoft's business practices, ranging from the features of its software to its relations with customers and rivals, were to take effect in just 11 weeks. They were part of an order signed two weeks ago by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson that also called for a breakup of the company.</p>
        <p>The judge had already stayed the breakup until appeals were complete. Now none of the steps he ordered in his remedy ruling may go into effect for a year or longer, even if they are upheld.</p>
        <p>Microsoft was jubilant; for weeks the company had been arguing that the conduct restrictions would cause grievous harm to the company and its customers.</p>
        <p>Judge Jackson's stay order was issued as he sent the case to the Supreme Court for direct review, an idea the Justice Department had advocated and Microsoft had vigorously opposed.</p>
        <p>Under a provision of antitrust law, cases with significant impact can be appealed directly to the Supreme Court. With Judge Jackson's action today, it is now up to the Supreme Court to decide whether to take the case directly, or to let an appeal be heard first by the Court of Appeals.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department lauded Judge Jackson for referring the case to the high court but added, ''Given the district court's decision to stay the remedy during the appeal process, the direct appeal to the Supreme Court is of particular importance to the national interest.''</p>
        <p>In a brief filed with Judge Jackson earlier today, the department had argued that ''in an industry Microsoft vigorously characterizes as fast paced and quickly changing,'' delay ''would undermine the ultimate value of the remedy to correct the harmful results of Microsoft's anticompetitive actions and to restore competition.''</p>
        <p>Judge Jackson did not explain his decision to stay the conduct restrictions, but he appears uncomfortable with imposing a sweeping remedy before his work on the case has been reviewed by a higher court.</p>
        <p>In an interview earlier this year, the judge said: ''I have been in splendid isolation on this case long enough. I would welcome another mind studying my work product to see if I am correct or wrongheaded. I want to move this case upstairs as quickly as possible.''</p>
        <p>Until the judge's order today, the Supreme Court would have been called on to rule quickly on Microsoft's request to stay the remedy order -- or to decide that the entire case should be sent to the appeals court. Now the Supreme Court, or the appeals court, can review the entire appeal, and rule on it, before deciding whether to impose Judge Jackson's remedy, to modify it or to cancel it. The process could take a year -- or longer if the case is sent back to the appeals court and then appealed to the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>Under Judge Jackson's order, Microsoft would be broken into separate companies, one for its Windows operating system and one for its other software and Internet businesses. The company would also be forced to comply with a long list of restrictions on its conduct lasting three years if the breakup order withstands appeal, and 10 years if it does not.</p>
        <p>The provisions included uniform royalty terms for Windows products, a ban on exclusive deals or on making the company's sales to hardware or software makers contingent on use of other Microsoft products, and an order not to retaliate against ''any person or entity'' that provided evidence against it.</p>
        <p>Those conduct restrictions were to take effect 90 days after his order was issued, or Sept. 5. And though the breakup itself was stayed until appeals were complete, Microsoft was required to prepare a detailed plan for the breakup by Oct. 5. That order is now stayed as well.</p>
        <p>At least in the short term, Microsoft can now carry out new business -- like moving its next generation of software products increasingly from the personal computer to the Internet -- unimpeded by the restrictions proposed by the government and approved by Judge Jackson.</p>
        <p>This evening, Vivek Varma, a Microsoft spokesman, said: ''Obviously we are very pleased with the judge's decision to stay the remedy order. This lets us go forward with our appeal without any disruption to our business and our customers.''</p>
        <p>The law under which direct appeals are authorized, the Expediting Act, has been used in only one previous case, the AT&amp;T case, since it was revised in 1974. And so there are few precedents for judging how the Supreme Court might decide whether to take the case. But since the court's session ends shortly, a decision is not likely before the new term opens in October.</p>
        <p>Microsoft argues that the case is inappropriate for immediate Supreme Court review. But Richard E. Donovan, who is head of the antitrust and trade practice at the New York law firm of Kelley Drye &amp; Warren, noted that when Congress revised the law in 1974, the intent was to invoke it when the issues in question were ''the immediate economic impact of the case rather than on the significance of the legal issues presented.''</p>
        <p>Microsoft has repeatedly argued that Judge Jackson's remedy ''could have a significant adverse impact on the nation's economy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Donovan also noted that the federal government, ''through the attorney general and the solicitor general, supports a direct appeal,'' and ''the Supreme Court tends to accord substantial weight to their opinions in such matters.''</p>
        <p>In its brief filed earlier today, the government told Judge Jackson that Microsoft's effort to avert a direct appeal ''misstates and misapplies the appropriate legal standard for certification and ignores the incontrovertible importance of prompt resolution of this case to consumers and the national economy.'' Apparently Judge Jackson agreed.</p>
        <p>Microsoft tried to outmaneuver Judge Jackson and the Justice Department by filing a part of its appeal with the Court of Appeals last week, before the government had a chance to file its direct-appeal request.</p>
        <p>The appeals court eagerly accepted the case, and even laid out an aggressive schedule for hearing it, but also made clear that the schedule would be suspended as soon as Judge Jackson sent the case to the Supreme Court. When he did so today, the appeals court stood down.</p>
