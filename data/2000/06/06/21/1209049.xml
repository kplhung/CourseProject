        <p>I grew up in St. Petersburg, Fla. I started my own company, Cut and Bag Lawn Service, during junior high school. I made $6 to $8 a lawn, and on a good day, I could mow two to three lawns an hour. I paid friends $5 an hour to help me, way above minimum wage. We built up to about 50 lawns a week. My mother was upset when she figured out I made more per hour than she did. She had a master's degree and ran the county's reading program.</p>

        <p>I grew up in St. Petersburg, Fla. I started my own company, Cut and Bag Lawn Service, during junior high school. I made $6 to $8 a lawn, and on a good day, I could mow two to three lawns an hour. I paid friends $5 an hour to help me, way above minimum wage. We built up to about 50 lawns a week. My mother was upset when she figured out I made more per hour than she did. She had a master's degree and ran the county's reading program.</p>
        <p>During high school, I was president of the National Honor Society, the scuba club and the science club, and I became an Eagle Scout. I also ran track and cross-country.</p>
        <p>For two years in high school, I was in Junior Achievement, a national, nonprofit organization that helps kids understand free enterprise by having them set up a company. A group of us set up a mutual fund company, and a regional brokerage firm sponsored us. We'd meet at their offices once a week, and they'd teach us how to research stocks. Then we'd vote on which ones to buy. The year I was president of the J.A. company, I went to Indiana to compete for National President of the Year. I could have won a $10,000 scholarship. Unfortunately, I missed a trick question that defined G.N.P. as gross national profit rather than gross national product.</p>
        <p>I sold my lawn business prior to starting engineering school at the University of Florida, and I wanted to invest the money. After reading a book titled ''How I Turned $1,000 Into $3,000,000 in Real Estate in My Spare Time,'' I bought this big, old rambling house that had been converted into seven apartments. My tenants were surprised to have an 18-year-old landlord. I also bought another apartment building and three rental houses.</p>
        <p>Altogether, I managed and maintained about 50 rental units. I was pretty busy. I paid for much of my undergraduate degree and my Harvard M.B.A. with my real estate profits.</p>
        <p>My wife-to-be and I started dating at age 14. We were both voted Teens of the Month, and our pictures appeared together in The St. Petersburg Times. We got married in college, and our first baby was born the night before my first final at Harvard Business School. When I walked into the exam, everyone clapped because no one expected me to show up.</p>
        <p>I have a 21-foot boat named Discover (for Discover Card) that I use for water skiing in the lakes around Chicago. I also keep a fishing boat on a small, private island I own near the Florida Panhandle. There's an Indian burial ground on the island, and I've been working to stave off the erosion from the storms of the last 10 years. I've also been working with a couple of Florida colleges to research and preserve Indian artifacts. A Florida newspaper once ran an article saying that a pirate had buried treasure on the island, and included a map. Shortly afterward we found holes all over the island, dug by people looking for the treasure. We've used a metal detector, though, and have never found any treasure.</p>
        <p>I've always been interested in technology. In junior high I took some courses at a local science center that had a donated mainframe computer. I'd write programs to calculate how high my model rockets could fly. I've automated my current house with four networked PC's, and our lights are all computer-controlled. Dealing with networking problems at home has made me appreciate our LAN problems at work.</p>
