        <p>If Seagram is sold to Vivendi, Universal Studios, one of Hollywood's oldest and most storied movie studios, will change hands for the fifth time. Here is the studio's history.</p>
        <p>RICK LYMAN</p>
        <p>1912 -- The Universal Film Manufacturing Co. is founded in Chicago by Carl Laemmle and six other early film producers, though Mr. Laemmle emerges as the dominant partner. Three years later, he moves the company to the San Fernando Valley, just over the Cahuenga Pass from Hollywood. In its first year in California, Universal produces more than 250 silent films. Mr. Laemmle also sets up bleachers on the studio's back lot and charges people 25 cents to watch movies being made.</p>
        <p>1929 -- Universal Pictures wins its first best picture Oscar for Lewis Milestone's All Quiet on the Western Front. But the studio becomes best known in the 1930's for a string of popular and enduring horror films, including Frankenstein (1931), The Invisible Man (1933) and Bride of Frankenstein (1935).</p>
        <p>1935 -- Universal falls on hard times. Mr. Laemmle sells his interests in it to a consortium of financiers.</p>
        <p>1941 -- Beginning with a trio of military comedies released in the same year, ''Keep 'Em Flying,'' ''In the Navy''and ''Buck Privates,'' vaudeville team Bud Abbott and Lou Costello become the studio's biggest stars.</p>
        <p>1958 -- The Music Corporation of America, a talent agency founded by Jules Stein in Chicago in 1924 and run by president Lew Wasserman since 1946, buys the Universal Studios property in Universal City. In the 1950's, MCA produces several television series, including Alfred Hitchcock Presents and G.E. Theater With Ronald Reagan.</p>
        <p>1962 -- MCA merges with Universal Pictures.</p>
        <p>1964 -- Universal revives the practice of allowing paying tourists to visit the studio lot, establishing the first Universal Studios theme park. More than 100 million people have visited it since it opened.</p>
        <p>1973 -- Mr. Wasserman is named chief executive of MCA. Sid Scheinberg becomes president. ''The Sting'' becomes the first Universal movie in 26 years to win the Oscar for best picture.</p>
        <p>1975 -- Steven Spielberg, a young director championed by Mr. Scheinberg, makes ''Jaws,'' the first in a string of blockbusters that transforms the way movies are made.</p>
        <p>1982 -- MCA releases Mr. Spielberg's ''E.T.--The Extra-Terrestrial,'' the centerpiece of the studio's most lucrative period. During this time, the studio also releases ''The Deer Hunter'' (1978) and ''Out of Africa'' (1985). Each wins the Oscar for best picture.</p>
        <p>1991 -- MCA is acquired by the Matsushita Electrical Industrial Co., becoming one of the first major Hollywood studios to come under foreign ownership. The highlights of this period come in 1993 with the release of two Spielberg films, ''Jurassic Park'' and ''Schindler's List.''</p>
        <p>1995 -- The Seagram Co. acquires an 80 percent ownership stake in MCA.</p>
        <p>1997 -- Universal buys a majority interest in October Films, and eventually sells off its specialty film and television production divisions to Barry Diller, who combines them to create USA Films, a company in which Universal retains a significant stake.</p>
        <p>2000 -- Vivendi agrees to buy Seagram.</p>
