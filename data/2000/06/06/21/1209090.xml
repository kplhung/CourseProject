        <p>The view from The Lodge at Lions head is to die for.</p>
        <p>Gore Creek babbles along noisily, just beyond soaring pine trees that seem to reach halfway up the mountains in the distance.</p>
        <p>''You can even see the ski slopes,'' said Marilyn Dyer, owner of Unit 1 and president of the Lodge homeowners association, who splits the year between here and Denver.</p>
        <p>But not all is as peaceful and serene as it appears outside the back windows of Ms. Dyer's stylish three-bedroom, three-bath condominium, which she has owned for 14 years. The Lodge, built in 1978, is smack in the middle of a proposed major development project that town officials argue is critical for Vail's continued economic stability. To complete the most ambitious of several options, town officials want to tear down the four-level Lodge building and move all the residents, Ms. Dyer and 11 other unit owners, to a nearby site, where the town would construct a new building for them.</p>
        <p>''On a scale of 1 to 10, this would be close to a 10,'' Mayor Ludwig Kurtz said today, assessing the town's need to gain access to the Lodge site. ''Specifically because of the competition we are facing within the state and outside the state, not only in the ski business but also in the leisure and lifestyle business, we need to look at some pretty bold strokes.''</p>
        <p>For Vail and many other mountain resort towns in the West, these are challenging times because of a booming national economy that keeps them busy year round, with skiers in winter and hikers in summer. To attract the growing number of families with vacation money to burn, they are now engaged in a mighty competition, in which amenities often mean the difference between winning and losing billions in leisure dollars.</p>
        <p>Vail opened its ski resort in the early 1960's, making it one of the first Colorado areas to win acclaim as a world-class resort. But others, like Aspen, Telluride and Winter Park caught up fast. With unusually warm winters in recent years shortening the ski season, the competition has intensified. This season, skier visits to Colorado's 26 resorts dropped 4.5 percent, making it the second consecutive season in which fewer lift tickets were sold than the year before.</p>
        <p>Vail was a rare exception, with a 2.48 percent increase over the 1998-1999 ski season. But that was hardly enough for town officials to abandon their ''Vail Renaissance'' master plan to re-energize the resort, part of which includes building a second indoor skating rink, a cultural center, a conference center, office and retail space -- all wrapped around a small lake and plaza that would serve as a community gathering place.</p>
        <p>And so a band of architects set out to fulfill the town's dreams.</p>
        <p>The trouble for Ms. Dyer and her 11 neighbors was that the most lavish option meant tearing down the Lodge at Lionshead and moving its inhabitants, at no cost to them, a proposal that has not set well with the residents. Adding insult to injury, the town council had considered using an ordinance that would have allowed it to take control of the Lodge by declaring it ''blighted,'' a tactic Mayor Kurtz now says is unlikely.</p>
        <p>Still, as Ms. Dyer said today, she feels as if the homeowners have been strong-armed by the town, and by extension, Vail Resorts, the company that operates the ski slopes.</p>
        <p>''How would you feel?'' she asked, with a sweep of her arm taking in the vista beyond. ''This is why I chose this place. The pool, the trees, the privacy. We even have a waterfall over there, and we're so close to the creek.''</p>
        <p>Russell W. Forrest, director of community development for Vail, said the town would do everything possible to replicate what the Lodge owners now have, in effect, living units of 1,600 to 2,200 square feet that sell for as much as $1.5 million. By one design, a new building could be constructed at its current site, only turned from its current east-west axis to north-south, a change that would deprive most owners of the views they have now. Another option is to build across the proposed lake, a site still near the creek but away from the tall pines.</p>
        <p>Or, the residents could decline both offers, forcing town planners to embrace a less dramatic vision of the future, with fewer amenities and a smaller plaza. Ms. Dyer said she had no idea what the homeowners association might decide.</p>
        <p>Mayor Kurtz and other officials involved with the redevelopment plans say that whatever the homeowners decide is fine and that the town will plan accordingly.</p>
        <p>''There would be a small level of disappointment that we might not be able to do as well as we could,'' Mr. Kurtz said, contemplating the possibility that the homeowners would refuse to move. If so, he promised, they would not be stigmatized as obstructionists.</p>
        <p>It was less clear if they were in any danger of having their lift tickets pulled if they chose to remain.</p>
        <p>''You know, I never thought of that,'' Porter Wharton, senior vice president of public affairs for Vail Resorts, said with a mischievous grin.</p>
        <p>''Only kidding,'' Mr. Wharton said.</p>
