        <p>Earlier this year ABC canceled ''Sports Night.'' Now the Walt Disney Company, the network's parent, is  trying to sell it to another television outlet.</p>
        <p>Created by Aaron Sorkin for the Touchstone Television production studio -- which, like ABC, is owned by Disney, the show centered on a television sports news program much like ESPN's ''Sportscenter.'' TV Guide once called it ''the best show you're not watching.'' Despite critical praise, it did not draw very  high ratings.</p>
        <p>Although it looked as if ''Sports Night'' might live on on HBO, negotiations between Disney and the cable company are said to be nearly dead. And one executive said that efforts to sell it to the TNT or Showtime cable channels did not seem to be working out.</p>
        <p>Though there is still hope at Disney that ''Sports Night'' will find a home, an executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity expressed some doubt. The program is very expensive to produce, he said, and thus very expensive to buy.</p>
        <p>This must come as a disappointment to Mr. Sorkin. But then, the glass is still half-full for him. NBC has picked up his other show, ''West Wing,'' for another season.</p>
