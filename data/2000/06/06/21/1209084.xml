        <p>Editorial on failure of Energy Department officials from Bill Richardson on down to provide adequate explanations for disappearance and mysterious reappearance of computer hard drives at Los Alamos nuclear weapons laboratory; says tighter oversight cannot come too soon, and ought to come from National Nuclear Security Administration set up by Congress in response to earlier fiasco involving Wen Ho Lee</p>

        <p>Energy Department officials from Secretary Bill Richardson on down have failed to provide adequate explanations for the disappearance and mysterious reappearance of two computer hard drives containing sensitive nuclear bomb information from the Los Alamos nuclear weapons laboratory. More than a year after charges that a Los Alamos scientist, Wen Ho Lee, removed and copied secret nuclear weapons data brought the lab's lax security procedures to national attention, management there remains shockingly lackadaisical.</p>
        <p>Tighter oversight cannot come soon enough. Primary responsibility must now go to the National Nuclear Security Administration, created by Congress in response to the Wen Ho Lee fiasco. Its newly confirmed director, Gen. John Gordon, a physicist who currently serves as deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency, appears ideally qualified for the job. Secretary Richardson, who initially resisted the creation of this semiautonomous agency within the Energy Department, must give General Gordon his fullest cooperation. Senate Republicans are pressing for Mr. Richardson's resignation, but for the moment we see a greater value in continuity, provided the secretary will really take on the flawed security culture that he has blamed for the lapses.</p>

        <p>Energy Department officials from Secretary Bill Richardson on down have failed to provide adequate explanations for the disappearance and mysterious reappearance of two computer hard drives containing sensitive nuclear bomb information from the Los Alamos nuclear weapons laboratory. More than a year after charges that a Los Alamos scientist, Wen Ho Lee, removed and copied secret nuclear weapons data brought the lab's lax security procedures to national attention, management there remains shockingly lackadaisical.</p>
        <p>Tighter oversight cannot come soon enough. Primary responsibility must now go to the National Nuclear Security Administration, created by Congress in response to the Wen Ho Lee fiasco. Its newly confirmed director, Gen. John Gordon, a physicist who currently serves as deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency, appears ideally qualified for the job. Secretary Richardson, who initially resisted the creation of this semiautonomous agency within the Energy Department, must give General Gordon his fullest cooperation. Senate Republicans are pressing for Mr. Richardson's resignation, but for the moment we see a greater value in continuity, provided the secretary will really take on the flawed security culture that he has blamed for the lapses.</p>
        <p>The new security administration was designed to establish clear lines of authority over the department's nuclear weapons agencies, replacing the current tangle of overlapping bureaucratic responsibilities. This structure will allow General Gordon to ensure that stricter security guidelines are drawn up and followed at all nuclear weapons laboratories. At a minimum he will have to establish stricter safeguards such as continuous camera monitoring of all areas where sensitive work is performed, more rigorous procedures for signing people and materials in and out, and more consistent use of safes and secure storage vaults for data not in current use. Equally important is making sure that lab employees become more aware of security issues themselves. They should know at all times what kind of data is on their computers and what precautions must be taken to protect it.</p>
        <p>The work of Los Alamos combines scientific inquiry, which needs a degree of openness, with weapons work, which requires strict secrecy. Over the years some scientists have clearly grown complacent about the security side of the equation. That may be partly because too much scientific research is overclassified, diminishing respect for security and making it harder to focus on protecting real secrets like bomb miniaturization formulas and computer programs for simulating nuclear weapons tests. Secretary Richardson and General Gordon will need to generate wholesale change in lax security attitudes at the national laboratories.</p>
