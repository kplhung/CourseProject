        <p>Chuck Knoblauch emerged from the third-base dugout to begin his pregame warm-ups with the Yankees today and the taunting immediately started. The Red Sox fans have delighted in trying to rattle Knoblauch, who has become a very easy target for opposing fans because of his very public throwing problems, so they pounced on him as if he were a miniature Roger Clemens.</p>
        <p>''Hey, Knobby, get a shrink,'' one fan yelled.</p>
        <p>''Take it easy on the kids in the front row,'' another fan screeched.</p>
        <p>''Knobby, are you going to hit any old ladies tonight?'' a third fan asked, alluding to a throw on Saturday that hit a woman at Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>Knoblauch initially ignored the fans, but then the second baseman shouted at some of them, and glared at others. It was a few hours before Knoblauch would play a pivotal role for the Yankees in their 3-0 victory over Pedro Martinez and the Red Sox and before he would be ejected for throwing his helmet.</p>
        <p>But his day began with angst from the stands, not the field.</p>
        <p>''If people make themselves happy by saying stuff like that, that's fine,'' Knoblauch said. ''They don't know what I'm going through. They don't have any idea. It's tough, but you have to ride it out. You can't let it bother you.''</p>
        <p>Manager Joe Torre essentially said that Knoblauch should get used to the verbal abuse because ''it's just going to be here.'' It might be louder at Fenway Park because of the intense rivalry and because the ballpark is so cozy, but Torre guessed it would probably follow Knoblauch.</p>
        <p>Obviously, there is an easy way to quiet the fans, and Knoblauch did that tonight by making three sparkling plays behind Andy Pettitte in one of his best defensive games of the year. Knoblauch ranged wide to his right three different times to get outs, including a gorgeous play on Jose Offerman's tapper in which he raced about 40 feet and then made a leaping off-balance throw to first.</p>
        <p>When Tino Martinez scooped the low throw for the third out, the fans were suddenly silent and stunned. How could they keep badgering Knoblauch if he made the sort of play that belongs on a sports highlight show? Knoblauch rushed off the field with his head high and his chest out.</p>
        <p>George Steinbrenner looked the same proud way as he boarded an elevator to leave Fenway after the victory. ''He has bounced back great,'' Steinbrenner said.</p>
        <p>Despite the flawless and truncated performance, Knoblauch, whose fourth-inning single was the first hit off Martinez, is not sure what it means. ''Who knows?'' he said. ''Today it was there. I don't know if it's going to be there tomorrow.''</p>
        <p>Knoblauch barreled into a bizarre situation when he bunted along the first-base line with a runner on first and no outs in the sixth. Martinez picked up the ball and his throw caromed off Knoblauch's left elbow as the runner was a stride away from reaching the base.</p>
        <p>The plate umpire, Larry Young, immediately raised his arms and called Knoblauch out for interference, indicating that he felt that Knoblauch was running out of the baseline. Knoblauch, the first-base coach Lee Mazzilli and Torre all argued, but Torre later watched a videotape replay and admitted that Knoblauch ''was illegal'' because one of his feet was over the baseline.</p>
        <p>Following the brief argument, Knoblauch got within 10 feet of the dugout, turned back and fired his helmet on the field. It landed about halfway between the third-base foul line and the mound. Martinez did not wait for the bat boy to get the helmet and instead threw it right back toward the Yankees dugout, falling as short as one of Knoblauch's throws during his funk.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes you do stupid things,'' said Knoblauch, referring to the helmet toss that caused his ejection, ''and that was a stupid thing.''</p>
        <p>To Knoblauch, throwing the helmet was stupid. Shouting and glaring at some abusive fans was not. To Knoblauch, that made sense. Maybe it was even therapeutic.</p>
        <p>''Certain times, it's refreshing to see what eye-to-eye contact does,'' Knoblauch said. ''It shuts people up in a hurry. At least you get the satisfaction of seeing who is yelling at you. If they're funny, they're funny. But they weren't tonight. They were pretty weak.''</p>
