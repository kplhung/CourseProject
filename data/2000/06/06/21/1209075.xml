        <p>Faced with growing public alarm over a wave of crime, the Brazilian government decreed an immediate ban today on the sale of firearms.

        <p>Faced with growing public alarm over a wave of crime, the Brazilian government decreed an immediate ban today on the sale of firearms. The move came as part of a broader $1.7 billion ''national security plan'' intended to reduce urban violence and reform the police during the next three years.</p>
        <p>The weapons restrictions will remain in effect until the end of this year, Justice Minister Jose Gregori announced at a news conference in Brasilia. By then, the government hopes to have won congressional approval of a more restrictive bill that would virtually ban the possession of firearms by any Brazilian citizen who is not a member of the armed forces, a police officer or an employee of a private security company.</p>
        <p>The government estimates that Brazilians now own more than eight million guns, about three-quarters of which are unregistered, and that guns are used in nearly 90 percent of the killings committed in this country, a much higher figure than in the United States. Under the proposed legislation, gun owners would have one year to turn in their weapons to the government.</p>
        <p>The security package, which President Fernando Henrique Cardoso announced in a nationally televised speech today, also includes $185 million to be spent this year alone on improved training and equipment for state and city police. Local police forces throughout this country of 175 million are widely viewed as trigger-happy, corrupt and incompetent, with many officers barely literate and earning salaries of $300 a month or less.</p>
        <p>''This is the first plan in the history of Brazil to attack the issue of public security in a comprehensive way,'' Justice Minister Gregori said.</p>
        <p>With the public clamoring for more security in advance of municipal elections scheduled for October, the government has been under mounting pressure to act to curb rising crime rates.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cardoso rejected, however, a much-discussed plan that would have used the military in crime-fighting activities. That step had been urged on him by some of the parties making up his governing coalition, but is highly controversial in a country that retains bitter memories of a 21-year military dictatorship that ended in 1985.</p>
        <p>The new security measures were announced a week after a gunman who appeared to be under the influence of drugs hijacked a city bus here and held six passengers hostage for four and a half hours. The episode, which was broadcast live on national television and has dominated news coverage ever since, ended when the hijacker, using one of his captives as a shield, stepped off the bus and was immediately fired upon by the police.</p>
        <p>The hostage, a 20-year-old schoolteacher, was struck by a police bullet and died in the ensuing exchange of gunfire. The hijacker survived, but the police who accompanied him in an ambulance strangled him on the way to the hospital and, according to official accounts, threatened violence against the doctors who insisted on listing asphyxiation as the cause of his death.</p>
        <p>One result has been a sharp outburst of anger and disgust, both with rising crime rates and the brutality and ineptness of the police. Mr. Cardoso has led the attacks, saying the way the police handled the hijacking  was ''totally unacceptable.'' The governor of the state of Rio de Janeiro, Anthony Garotinho, fired the commander of the military police and ordered that the policemen involved in the strangulation be arrested.</p>
        <p>The case took on added symbolism and importance when it emerged that the hijacker of the bus, 21-year-old Sandro do Nascimento, was a survivor of the notorious ''Candelaria massacre'' here, a 1993 incident in which military policemen sprayed gunfire at 72 abandoned street children who were sleeping on the sidewalk in front of the city's most famous church.</p>
        <p>The extent of concerns about public safety were demonstrated by a poll published Sunday in the newspaper O Globo, indicating that 81 percent of families here have at least one member who has been the victim of a crime. But 72 percent of those surveyed also said they have no confidence in the police as an institution, and 59 percent described the performance of the police as ''bad or dreadful.''</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the government plan announced today also calls for the hiring of 2,000 new federal police officers. That step is necessary, Mr. Cardoso said in his speech, because ''society is demanding a quicker response from all of us'' to combat crime.</p>
