        <p>Steven Madden, a designer who is chairman and chief executive of a popular women's shoe company, was arrested yesterday on charges of securities fraud, including accusations involving the initial public offering of his own company.</p>
        <p>In separate indictments, federal prosecutors in Brooklyn and Manhattan charged Mr. Madden with securities fraud, conspiracy and money laundering, saying that he participated in more than 20 fraudulent initial offerings of stock dating back to 1993, when Steven Madden Ltd. went public.</p>
        <p>In a related civil lawsuit, the Securities and Exchange Commission said that the stock frauds generated about $7 million in profits for Mr. Madden and others. The commission is seeking to bar Mr. Madden from serving as an officer or director of any publicly traded company, said Wayne Carlin, the S.E.C.'s associate regional director.</p>
        <p>Mr. Madden, 43, is a celebrity shoe designer whose trendy platform styles are available in 3,000 department stores and 60 Steven Madden stores. The company had sales of $163 million in fiscal 1999, nearly double the previous year.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Madden's arrest yesterday cast a cloud over his fast-growing company.</p>
        <p>Steven Marotta, who follows the company for Wasserstein Perella Securities, called Mr. Madden pivotal to the company and downgraded the stock from a ''buy'' to ''underperform.''</p>
        <p>''He is the key visionary,'' Mr. Marotta said. ''He has a team of designers who execute his orders, but he is the key guy. It is difficult to overstate his importance.''</p>
        <p>In a statement released yesterday, the company said its ''business remains strong and it plans to continue to execute its long-term strategies.''</p>
        <p>Lawyers for Mr. Madden vehemently protested the charges yesterday afternoon, saying that their client was innocent.</p>
        <p>Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn said Mr. Madden was involved in a scheme to manipulate the stock of Steven Madden when it went from being a small regional company with limited assets to a public company in December 1993.</p>
        <p>The offering was underwritten by the Stratton Oakmont brokerage firm, which is now defunct. The National Association of Securities Dealers had refused to allow Stratton Oakmont to underwrite the sale if any of the brokerage firm's principals owned more than 4.9 percent of the company's stock.</p>
        <p>To deceive the regulators, prosecutors charged, Mr. Madden falsely said that Stratton Oakmont's principals had sold shares to a separate company controlled by Mr. Madden. Prosecutors said that the sale was a sham and that Mr. Madden in fact had promised the Stratton Oakmont principals that they would continue to control the stock.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors said that in 1997 a principal in Stratton Oakmont demanded that Mr. Madden sell the stock and provide him with the proceeds. Mr. Madden refused, the prosecutors said, because he did not want to flood the market and depress the company's stock price. After a lawsuit was filed in state court, prosecutors said, Mr. Madden agreed to pay $4.1 million.</p>
        <p>The indictments in both Brooklyn and Manhattan charge that in a series of transactions over the next several years, Mr. Madden participated in schemes involving Stratton Oakmont and another brokerage firm, Monroe Parker, also now defunct.</p>
        <p>In those deals, prosecutors charged, Mr. Madden agreed to buy stock from companies before their public offerings and then sell it back to the brokerage firms once public trading began.</p>
        <p>The prosecutors said that Mr. Madden was allowed to keep some portion of that profit, which was the difference between what he paid for the stock and the price at which he sold it. They said the arrangement allowed the firms to effectively control and manipulate the market for those stocks. In some examples, prosecutors said, the firms were able to resell the stock at inflated prices.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors said the principals of both brokerage firms had already pleaded guilty to fraud.</p>
        <p>Mr. Madden's lawyers said their client had engaged in stock transactions with the brokerage firms but that he was innocent.</p>
        <p>''These indictments contain charges based on the words of convicted felons who wreaked havoc on Wall Street based on campaigns of deception, fraud and lies,'' said Corey Winograd, one of Mr. Madden's lawyers.</p>
        <p>''Nobody disputes you had transactions of stock,'' Mr. Winograd said. But he said that accusations of kickbacks and phony trades were unsubstantiated. ''There were transactions, transactions that were documented, transactions that were lawful and proper.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Madden was released on bond of $750,000, backed by three pieces of property, including his home in East Hampton, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Even though Mr. Madden is being charged with manipulating the stock of Steven Madden, most stock analysts say the company itself is in sound financial shape.</p>
        <p>''There are two cast of characters we are dealing with here,'' said Mr. Marotta of Wasserstein Perella Securities. ''One is the group that handled the I.P.O. and is involved with what happened with Steve's personal financials, and the other are the people he hired for the company, and these groups don't intersect.''</p>
        <p>Even though Mr. Marotta says the company has a healthy balance sheet, investors may lose confidence in the company in the short run and the brand could ''get off track'' in the long run.</p>
        <p>Mr. Madden owns 1.2 million shares, or nearly 10 percent, of the company, according to recent securities filings, and has options that would bring his stake to 18 percent. He sold 100,000 shares at $16 a share on May 31.</p>
        <p>Steven Madden stock, which peaked at $22.44 in April, fell $1.94 a share yesterday, to $11.19, before trading was halted in late morning. The company went public at $4 a share in 1993.</p>
