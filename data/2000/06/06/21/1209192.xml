        <p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation, in an unusual move, is helping with an intensifying investigation by the police in Jamaica into the disappearance last month of a travel guide editor from Queens who was staying at a beach resort.</p>
        <p>Two agents from the F.B.I.'s Miami office have been advising Jamaican police officials, while the New York office has agreed to pass out fliers to police officers and contacts in Jamaican neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens, said agency officials and Fred Kirschhoch, the father of the missing woman, Claudia Kirschhoch.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kirschhoch, 29, an editor for Frommer's travel guides, disappeared around May 28 from a hotel in the western resort town of Negril.</p>
        <p>Last week, her family increased a reward offer to $25,000 from $6,200 -- a sizable amount in Jamaica, where the average annual income in 1998 was the equivalent of $2,200. On the island, the police have begun helicopter sweeps and sent boats with search teams out to sea.</p>
        <p>''There's no report of her yet,'' Mr. Kirschhoch said. ''They have intensified their search throughout the island.'' Mr. Kirschhoch met Monday with F.B.I. agents in New York and handed them fliers with his daughter's picture, the reward amount and a toll-free telephone number. He said the agents agreed to help distribute them in neighborhoods with large numbers of Jamaicans, like Flatbush in Brooklyn and Jamaica in Queens.</p>
        <p>Although the F.B.I. sometimes investigates terrorist acts directed at American citizens abroad, it is rare for the agency to take on a missing-person case outside the country, said Terry Nelson, a spokesman for the Miami office. But in this case, bureau officials agreed to help after the Jamaican police contacted them.</p>
        <p>Agents searched Ms. Kirschhoch's one-bedroom apartment in Astoria, Queens, but found no clues, Mr. Nelson said. They have also been talking to people listed in Ms. Kirschhoch's address book. Last Tuesday, they questioned Tania Grossinger, a freelance travel writer who ate breakfast with Ms. Kirschhoch on May 27 at the Beaches Negril hotel.</p>
        <p>The two were staying there while on a working trip sponsored by Sandals, a resort chain.</p>
        <p>Ms. Grossinger flew back to New York that day, but Ms. Kirschhoch was not scheduled to return until June 1. When she failed to fly back, her parents called the hotel. In her room, the hotel staff found clothes, luggage and a wallet with cash and credit cards, but no sign of Ms. Kirschhoch.</p>
        <p>Days later, two F.B.I. agents from Miami flew to Jamaica. The police have been following up on several tips, including some suggesting that Ms. Kirschhoch was being held captive in foothills to the east of Negril.</p>
        <p>Last week, Mr. Kirschhoch, police officers and an F.B.I. agent drove up into the hills along paved roads and dirt tracks. They spoke with people who lived in small groups of shacks, but came away empty-handed, Mr. Kirschhoch said.</p>
        <p>Last weekend, the police began helicopter sweeps of the island after the owner of Sandals, Gordon Stewart, lent them the aircraft. They also began trawling the ocean and increased search efforts on the beach after it was determined that a bikini that Ms. Kirschhoch had recently bought in New York was missing from her hotel room.</p>
