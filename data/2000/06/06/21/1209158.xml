        <p>When Craig Kilborn left Comedy Central's ''Daily Show'' for CBS's ''Late Late Show'' in mid-1999, he was teamed with a new producer, Billy Kimball, who was also a veteran of Comedy Central as the producer of ''Indecision '92,'' a farcical take on that year's presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>Friday will be Mr. Kimball's last day on the show. He is leaving, citing creative differences with the program's star, Mr. Kilborn. He will be replaced by Mary Connelly, a onetime segment producer for David Letterman, whose production company, World Wide Pants, owns ''Late Late Show.'' Most recently, she was a producer on ABC's ''Whose Line Is  It Anyway?''</p>
        <p>Executives involved with the show said that Mr. Kilborn and Mr. Kimball had decided that they no longer had chemistry. A spokesman for Worldwide Pants said they ''had different ideas about how to take the show forward,'' but would not elaborate.</p>
        <p>''Late Late Show,'' which featured  Tom Snyder as the host before Mr. Kilborn arrived, is doing better in the ratings than it did last year. During the May sweeps, it was up 7 percent, with 1.45 million viewers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kimball said he was not sure what he would do next. ''My idea had been to star as Macbeth on Broadway,'' he said, jokingly referring to the ill-fated Broadway foray by the television actor Kelsey Grammer.  ''But a few people have called me to say that is not a good idea.''</p>
