        <p>Israel's Shas party drove its high-pressure bargaining to a new level of recklessness yesterday by giving 48 hours' notice of its departure from Prime Minister Ehud Barak's governing coalition. Shas's concerns have nothing to do with peacemaking or the Palestinians. But if Shas, an Orthodox religious party, carries out its resignation threat, Mr. Barak will lose the broad parliamentary majority he needs to negotiate a final peace deal with the Palestinians later this summer as planned.</p>
        <p>The issues dividing Shas from its government partners are narrower than they were a few weeks ago when this crisis began. Both sides need to find ways to bridge the remaining gaps and keep Shas inside the Barak coalition.</p>

        <p>Israel's Shas party drove its high-pressure bargaining to a new level of recklessness yesterday by giving 48 hours' notice of its departure from Prime Minister Ehud Barak's governing coalition. Shas's concerns have nothing to do with peacemaking or the Palestinians. But if Shas, an Orthodox religious party, carries out its resignation threat, Mr. Barak will lose the broad parliamentary majority he needs to negotiate a final peace deal with the Palestinians later this summer as planned.</p>
        <p>The issues dividing Shas from its government partners are narrower than they were a few weeks ago when this crisis began. Both sides need to find ways to bridge the remaining gaps and keep Shas inside the Barak coalition.</p>
        <p>One of Shas's main demands concerns a network of radio stations owned by its religious supporters. Currently those stations are unlicensed and risk being shut down by the police. Shas wants guarantees from Mr. Barak that they will be quickly accredited. The government fears that making such a deal could create an irresistible precedent allowing other unlicensed stations to evade reasonable licensing requirements.</p>
        <p>Shas's other main concern is insulating its private school system from supervision by Mr. Barak's education minister, a strong secularist. It has already gotten extra funding for its financially struggling schools. Mr. Barak now proposes shifting authority over those schools to the prime minister's office. Shas has not yet responded to this offer.</p>
        <p>Shas's constituency, mainly working-class Jews whose families came to Israel from other Middle Eastern countries, is a large and important one. Only in recent years has it begun to be fairly represented in the Israeli political system. By reaching agreement, Prime Minister Barak and Shas party leaders can preserve a broadly inclusive government as well as maintaining the delicate momentum of peacemaking.</p>
