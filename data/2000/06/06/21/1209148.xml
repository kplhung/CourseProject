        <p>Testing the baseballs being used this season, Major League Baseball was unable to squeeze any more juice out of them than they found in balls from the previous two seasons.</p>
        <p>That was the report issued yesterday by Sandy Alderson, executive vice president of baseball operations, following a meeting with the people who tested the balls.</p>
        <p>''There is no difference between the balls this year and the balls from 1999 and -- to the extent we could test balls from '98 -- '98 as well,'' Alderson said. ''We're satisfied that nothing has taken place in the last two or three years to change the ball.''</p>
        <p>An increase in home runs and runs this season fueled speculation that the ball was livelier. Some pitchers have said the ball's cover is slicker, making it more difficult to throw certain pitches. Other observers have explained the increase in the growing strength of the hitters, the shrinking talent of the pitchers and the smaller sizes of the new parks.</p>
        <p>Rawlings, which manufactures major league baseballs in Haiti, has long said the balls have not changed, neither in the materials used nor in the manufacturing process. Baseball assigned its testing to Jim Sherwood, a professor at the University of Massachusetts at Lowell, and Larry Fallon, who has a laboratory in Cambridge. Under baseball rules, the key to the acceptability of the balls is whether they fall within a range of specifications.</p>
        <p>''Within this range of specifications that are acceptable, we can have balls at both ends of the spectrum and they will perform differently,'' Alderson said. ''But based on what we've seen so far, we don't see balls at either end of the spectrum. They are tightly bunched at sort of the high end of coefficient of restitution specifications, but they have been for some time.</p>
        <p>''If you were to take balls at the low end of the spectrum,'' he added, ''you'd have a ball like the Cubans have, which is essentially dead. We haven't had that for a long time.''</p>
        <p>Alderson said his study of the balls will continue. ''We want to learn more about the process and see what continuity there has been,'' he said. ''We want to see what the pattern has been over a longer period of time.''</p>
        <p>But, he added, the problem presented by the testing of older baseballs is that the aging process can affect them.</p>
        <p>Entering last night's games, home runs were up over last season from 2.31 a game to 2.56 and runs were up from 10.29 a game to 10.49 a game.</p>
        <p>A flurry of high-scoring, lopsided games in the previous two days prompted speculation that scoring was soaring out of control. Elias Sports Bureau, however, found a decline in the number of games decided by 10 or more runs. Last season produced exactly 100 such games. So far this season there have been 35 of those games. That number projects to 84 for the entire season.</p>
