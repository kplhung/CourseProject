        <p>TRUE STORY  A Novel  By Bill Maher  302 pages. Simon &amp; Schuster. $23.</p>
        <p>Bill Maher, known to those who watch late-night television as the creator and host of the program ''Politically Incorrect,'' doesn't waste any time introducing the main characters of ''True Story,'' a novel he wrote a decade ago that is just now being published in hardcover. In his first paragraph he introduces the five comedians who inhabit the rest of the book, five men of the early 1980's variously unsuited for any of the usual bourgeois occupations, riding the Amtrak Minuteman from New York to gigs in Wilmington and Baltimore.</p>
        <p>By the time Mr. Maher is finished about 300 pages later, the reader has had a thorough experience of this raucously ill-starred band of brothers whose lives are equally devoted to career and sex. Too thorough, actually. Mr. Maher has written a novel with many funny passages of a kind of sandpaper humor whose chief engine is the relentlessly adolescent urgings of the five strenuously striving comics. Mr. Maher himself is a man of considerable restless talent, with a special gift for earthy dialogue, more politically incorrect in its absence of euphemism and nicety than his television program is.</p>
        <p>So one enjoys ''True Story'' for its bawdy energy, its flamethrower wit, even if it has the enduring impact of yesterday's potato chips. There is a limit to just how long one wants to be in intensive contact with a group of guys who remind you of the nervously aggressive jokesters in high school, the ones who were always cracking about masturbation and hair growing in the palm. '' 'Yeah, yeah,' Buck sighed. 'The penis. It's our bane and boon, isn't it?' '' Buck is one of Mr. Maher's single-minded comedians, and while there are many better lines of dialogue than that in this book, that stale observation is typical of many. Mr. Maher's five main characters range from a relative old hand to a relative neophyte in the stand-up comic game. They are in their 20's and 30's, all saturated in the comic sensibility of the early 1980's, a sort of post-Lenny Bruce mockery of bourgeois pretense, a stripping away of the veneer of civility. One of the enjoyable elements of Mr. Maher's book is that as a stand-up comedian himself, he is able to write some pretty funny material for his characters, like these lines in which Buck wishes his audience goodbye:</p>
        <p>''I would love to stay, but it would keep me from going.</p>
        <p>''Because this is certainly a night I will remember till I get to my car.</p>
        <p>''Thank you, you were execrable, good night!''</p>
        <p>Come to think of it, as Mr. Maher says about a different passage, that isn't all that funny, and indeed, the humor in ''True Story'' is hit or miss, as humor often is. Mr. Maher is a .300 hitter in this sense, which is pretty good, especially when sustained over an entire novel. Some passages are hilarious, but even so, there is the general problem that jokes designed for a live club do not have the same effect on the printed page. The same is true of the constant repartee that takes place among the characters, a repartee that varies between the stiletto and the sledgehammer forms.</p>
        <p>''It is the X factor in comedy,'' Mr. Maher writes at one point about why jokes work sometimes and other times don't. ''One can hone material, rehearse delivery, bone up on all the tangibles, but in the end it comes down to something very much like what makes a man and a woman have enduring passion -- something that no one can ever know, because such knowledge, like that coveted by Adam and Eve, would itself be the agent of destruction.''</p>
        <p>In the end, when ''True Story'' works, it works because of Mr. Maher's energetic intelligence and his creation of characters whose prolonged sophomorism has distinct qualities. The five comedians grow and change during the year or so of ''True Story's'' span, and Mr. Maher certainly captures their world as they deal with comedy club managers, chase women, take drugs, worry about ''zits'' and engage heroically in the risky effort to make other people laugh on demand. They are not deep or refined characters, and the wit is not subtle or dry, but they all have charm, even if it comes from a rueful acknowledgment of their fecklessness and their failings.</p>
        <p>''I feel good. I don't know if it's the drugs,'' one of the guys tells Buck after they take LSD in Central Park.</p>
        <p>''I think it is.</p>
        <p>''Why?</p>
        <p>''Because I paid good money for them, and I'd hate to think we could be feeling good for free.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Maher lives comfortably within the cramped spiritual dimensions of his characters, never trying to get out of them anything more than they would feasibly produce. When Fat, in the interests of seducing the young woman of his desires, goes on a diet, it lasts for two meals. When Buck falls for a certain Vera, he finds her frequent use of the word like, ''which he formerly had excoriated as an unpardonable lapse of verbal facility and harbinger of the collapse of Western civilization,'' charming. Dick, who is the champion seducer of the group, ends up with a woman named Jill who is so sealed into the chamber of her own selfishness that she cannot see the wreckage she causes around her. She is recognizable as a post-60's type, liberated to a fault but devoid of any sense of rebellious idealism. Also recognizable is Dick's ability to see through to her selfish core and yet to remain trapped within her orbit.</p>
        <p>''True Story,'' in other words, often has a satirical ring of truth to it. You might like it, though you'll have to have a fairly large appetite for post-''Leave It to Beaver'' artifacts if you do.</p>
