        <p>A front-page article on Sunday reported on the wide variety of low-budget theatrical productions around New York City making use of the city's huge pool of unemployed talent.</p>
        <p>The article was illustrated by a photograph of four dancers from the unpaid cast of a production of ''Goldilocks'' rehearsing in front of a large mirror. The picture was made with a panoramic camera at a very slow shutter speed, in which the film is exposed from left to right over a period of a full second (compared with a standard speed ranging from one-thirtieth to one-thousandth of a second). Because of the very slow speed, the dancers' images as reflected in the mirror were caught at a slightly later moment, so they looked different.</p>
        <p>This camera technique had an unusual effect in print, raising questions among some readers about whether there had been digital tampering with the image. To forestall such questions, the explanation of the unusual staggering of images should have been explained in the caption.</p>
