        <p>British police officers investigating the deaths of 58 Chinese immigrants found crammed into the freight container of a truck in Dover ordered the Dutch driver held on suspicion of manslaughter today and began interviewing two men in a Canterbury hospital who lived through the ordeal.</p>
        <p>''The two men are of enormous value to us simply because they are the only survivors,'' said Detective Superintendent Dennis McGookin, the head of the investigation. ''This is being treated as a homicide; it is a major criminal investigation.''</p>
        <p>The case has focused attention on the lucrative international business of smuggling desperate refugees who the British police say will pay crime syndicates up to $30,000 each to be brought here. Prime Minister Tony Blair, in Portugal at a European meeting, said the case had prompted a ''huge willingness'' on the part of continental leaders to ''tackle this problem of trade in human misery.''</p>
        <p>The Dutch police said they had arrested a man in Rotterdam in connection with the grisly discovery in the English channel port, but they gave no details. The 50-foot transport  was registered to a Rotterdam company that had been set up just five days earlier, and the police were searching for Arie van der Spek, a 24-year-old engineer who lived at the address listed for the company.</p>
        <p>Mr. McGookin said initial forensic findings showed the 54 men and 4 women died of ''some form of respiratory failure.'' The truck's refrigeration system had been turned off, turning the space packed with the migrants and stacked high with tomato crates into an airless oven.</p>
        <p>British newspapers reported that the two survivors said they were clawing at the inside of the sealed back door and screaming at the driver. The moment that customs officers opened the doors, they reportedly said, was ''as if an angel had been sent from heaven.''</p>
        <p>Officers pulled the vehicle over shortly after midnight on Sunday as it left the ferry, which had made the four-and-a-half-hour crossing from Zeebrugge in Belgium. Belgian authorities alerted British customs officials about their suspicions when they could find no prior record of the company listed in the registry and when they saw the driver pay for the journey in cash.</p>
        <p>Mr. McGookin said the victims were all in their 20's and came from Fujian province in southern China. Yang Chen, who entered Britain in January and has applied for political asylum, said today that he thought his cousin, Chen Lin, was one of the victims. He said that Mr. Chen, 19, made calls regularly during a four-month odyssey from China through Russia and into Western Europe.  ''The last call was from Holland on Sunday and they said they were traveling to the United Kingdom that night,'' Mr. Yang told the Press Association news agency.</p>
        <p>Many of the estimated 150,000 Chinese living in Britain come from Fujian, but authorities worry that they will not come forward for fear of exposing themselves to arrest and deportation as illegal residents.</p>
