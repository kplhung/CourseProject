        <p>NORTHERN IRELAND: BOMB THREAT -- British Army experts defused a small bomb in a bag that had been thrown over the fortified high wall surrounding the grounds of Hillsborough Castle, the official home of the Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, outside Belfast. Mr. Mandelson was in London at the time. A Downing Street spokesman said, ''It was found well away from the house, it was a small device and I would not want to oxygenate the story by taking up what is a comparatively minor incident.''</p>

        <p>MONTENEGRO: U.N. PROSECUTOR TO VISIT -- The chief prosecutor at the United Nations war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Carla Del Ponte, will travel to Montenegro tomorrow even though the Yugoslav government has refused her a visa and Serbian nationalists have threatened to block her visit. Invited by the Montenegrin president, Milo Djukanovic, and his increasingly independent-minded government, Ms. Del Ponte will be discussing setting up an office in Montenegro to interview Serb victims as well as witnesses of possible war crimes in Kosovo.</p>

        <p>EUROPEAN UNION: AUSTRIA CURBS STAY -- European Union leaders meeting in Portugal decided to maintain sanctions against Austria imposed after Chancellor Wolfgang Schussel formed a government with the far-right Freedom Party last February. Austria had lobbied hard among its 14 European Union partners to have the sanctions lifted.</p>

        <p>COLOMBIA: 2 KILLED IN KIDNAPPING -- The brother of Fabio Valencia, a leading member of the government delegation trying to negotiate a peace accord with the main leftist rebel group, has been kidnapped after a shootout in Medellin in which a bodyguard and an assailant died. None of Colombia's armed groups have claimed responsibility for the abduction of Guillermo Valencia, but the country's main right-wing group accused Fabio Valencia of ''defending the interests of the subversives'' after he said the rebels and the government shared ''a common enemy.''</p>

        <p>PARAGUAY: 2-DAY STRIKE SET -- Paraguay's largest unions prepared to begin a 48-hour nationwide strike starting tomorrow to protest the economic policies of President Luis Gonzalez Macchi. The head of the National Transport Workers Union, Persio Duarte, said, ''This will be the biggest strike in the five last years and we'll repeat it in less than a month if the authorities do not yield.''</p>

        <p>EAST TIMOR: U.N. CUTS BACK -- The United Nations refugee agency, frustrated by months of stalling by Indonesia over ending violence against East Timorese refugees in West Timor, suspended relief work in three camps. A spokesman in Geneva for the United Nations high commissioner for refugees said armed gangs responsible for sacking East Timorese towns and terrorizing Timorese who voted for independence were still intimidating and attacking East Timorese in camps in West Timor, an Indonesian territory.</p>

        <p>SOUTH KOREA: DOCTORS WALK OUT -- Hospitals and clinics were crippled as tens of thousands of doctors and interns began a nationwide strike to protest a new law that will prevent physicians from selling most drugs. Selling medicines is a major source of income for most doctors in South Korea, but the new law gives pharmacists exclusive rights to fill prescriptions. The government vowed to take stern legal action against doctors' unions and members who strike.</p>

        <p>BANGLADESH: IN AND OUT -- Opposition members of Parliament, who have boycotted Parliament for nearly a year to press for the resignation of Prime Minister Sheik Hasina's government, returned briefly and then walked out less than an hour later. Under Bangladesh law, parliamentary membership can be canceled if legislators are absent for 90 consecutive assembly working days.</p>

        <p>LEBANON: HEZBOLLAH WARNING -- The head of Lebanon's Hezbollah guerrillas warned Secretary General Kofi Annan of the United Nations that their war of liberation would continue unless Israeli border violations were ended. Mr. Annan met Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, left, during a 24-hour visit in an effort to win backing for peacekeeping plans in southern Lebanon. He pledged to investigate complaints that Israel still occupies Lebanese land.</p>

        <p>NIGERIA: NORTHERN ALERT -- Security forces have been sent to the northern state of Kano, which today will become the third state to institute Shariah, the strict Islamic penal and social code. The debate over Shariah has led to hundreds of deaths as Christians and Muslims fought each other in Kaduna, a state that had been considering its adoption.</p>
