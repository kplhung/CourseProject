        <p>Richard M Frauenglass letter on June 20 editorial lauds golfer Tiger Woods for honing natural talent by continuous practice and reinforcement</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>While you laud the ability of Tiger Woods (editorial, June 20), a man whose surgery at Pebble Beach is without comparison, a man who hits shots on a daily basis that we hackers would give everything to hit yearly, I would like to emphasize one aspect of his game.</p>
        <p>Listen carefully to the commentators' asides and you will hear about the number of hours Woods spends on the practice tee, working on every aspect of his game. He has taken his natural talent and honed it by continuous practice and reinforcement. His teacher, Butch Harmon, is usually but a few steps away, observing and correcting minor flaws. And from this, Woods acquires the belief in himself from which he draws his calm demeanor.</p>

        <p>This is a lesson we can all learn. Achievement requires work on a daily basis and is not limited to Sunday afternoons.</p>
