        <p>If Gov. George E. Pataki signs a bill passed last week by the New York Assembly and earlier by the State Senate, parents in New York will be able to abandon unwanted newborn babies at drop-off centers without fear of prosecution. Texas already has these centers, and other states are considering them. Politicians go misty-eyed over this kind of legislation, which lets them crow about how much they care about children.</p>
        <p>What they fail to mention is that despite a few highly publicized cases of babies found in trash baskets and dumpsters, the anonymous abandonment of newborns is hardly a national epidemic: in 1998, there were 105 cases, up from 65 in 1991. Some articles have misstated these numbers, referring to the thousands of babies left behind by their mothers at hospitals each year as if they, too, were abandoned, when the vast majority have been taken into custody by social services departments because of their mothers' drug use.</p>

        <p>If Gov. George E. Pataki signs a bill passed last week by the New York Assembly and earlier by the State Senate, parents in New York will be able to abandon unwanted newborn babies at drop-off centers without fear of prosecution. Texas already has these centers, and other states are considering them. Politicians go misty-eyed over this kind of legislation, which lets them crow about how much they care about children.</p>
        <p>What they fail to mention is that despite a few highly publicized cases of babies found in trash baskets and dumpsters, the anonymous abandonment of newborns is hardly a national epidemic: in 1998, there were 105 cases, up from 65 in 1991. Some articles have misstated these numbers, referring to the thousands of babies left behind by their mothers at hospitals each year as if they, too, were abandoned, when the vast majority have been taken into custody by social services departments because of their mothers' drug use.</p>
        <p>If there are 100 problems within the child welfare arena, the abandonment of infants ranks between No. 99 and 100 in severity. Far closer to the top were the cases of the 31,000 babies taken from their mothers after birth last year because they were born with illegal drugs in their bodies, or the 4,000 children killed by firearms. Tens of thousands suffered in violent or neglectful homes.</p>
        <p>Proponents of the drop-off centers also ignore the obvious fact that parents can legally give up their children now -- though not in secrecy -- by putting them up for adoption. Although children left at drop-off centers would, in the end, probably be adopted, the legal path would not be smooth. Adoption is designed to work within a well tested framework of laws. The parent is given time to consider the decision and receive counseling. There are allowances for notifying fathers who are not present. Adoptive parents receive information about the child's genetic background.</p>
        <p>I work at the bottom of the judicial food chain, in juvenile court, and the clients I represent there, abused and neglected children, have the least clout of any in the legal system. Daily I see their lives laid waste. In some cases it is inevitable: what some parents do to children cannot be undone by social workers, judges and lawyers. But too often the misused influence of politicians and interest groups is causing unintended misery.</p>
        <p>Sometimes this influence spends too much energy in the wrong places; other times it actually puts up obstacles to better chances for children, as when laws are blocked that could take guns off the street or help women plan their families. The rush to provide newborn drop-off centers is certainly a misallocation of effort. So far as it works to discourage adoption, it may actively cause harm, as well.</p>
