        <p>Beaches here have been closed to swimmers for nearly a week because of a huge sewage spill, disappointing vacationers and slowing oceanfront business.</p>
        <p>The water remained deserted as beachgoers picnicked on the sand and threw Frisbees, far from the shores, following warnings written in four languages and posted on trash cans and lifeguard stands.</p>
        <p>''It's contaminated,'' said Massy Hernandez, an accountant who lives in Miami Beach. ''So why risk it?''</p>
        <p>Millions of gallons of raw sewage were deposited in Miami's waters on Tuesday after a construction company accidentally cut into a pipe, closing beaches from Key Biscayne to north of Miami Beach. Miami-Dade County officials said the pipe, which carries waste from Miami Beach to a nearby treatment plant, split when a concrete piling was driven through it.</p>
        <p>The next day, local authorities began to close beaches for fishing and swimming. Experts said bathing in the water could cause diarrhea, vomiting and skin irritation.</p>
        <p>The Miami-Dade Department of Environmental Resources Management has hired a company to repair the 54-inch sewer pipe, which is buried under the ocean. Officials predict that it will take several more days to fix.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, tourists were coming to the beach to look at the water. In the distance were mainly cruise ships, none of the usual small fishing boats.</p>
        <p>But the water, which looked clear, did not stop some uninformed vacationers from swimming at Miami Beach.</p>
        <p>''This is the first we've heard of this,'' said Carlos Lopez of Guatemala. When the sign saying ''Danger, contaminated water'' was pointed out, he got out of the water and into a beachside shower.</p>
        <p>''We were surprised that no one else was swimming,'' Mr. Lopez said.</p>
