        <p>THE state's chief judge, Judith S. Kaye, last week announced an ambitious statewide plan to offer treatment rather than prison to thousands of nonviolent, drug-addicted criminals throughout New York -- a ''national first,'' proclaimed the press release.</p>
        <p>If only the enthusiastic jurist could really wave her magic wand and send waves of defendants -- 10,000 by 2003, she predicts -- to be helped rather than punished.</p>
        <p>Alas, nothing is that simple in government. Judge Kaye, the chief judge of the State Court of Appeals, has lots of partners empowered to wave their own wands.</p>
        <p>There are the Legislature and governor, who control the sentencing laws and the state budget; defense attorneys, and the state's 62 muscular prosecutors, one a county. They jealously guard their prerogatives, and wield the ultimate power over defendants by deciding on what charges to indict them. Everything flows from the charges.</p>
        <p>''She is doing everything in her authority to institute a saner and more effective approach to this problem,'' said Robert Gangi, executive director of the Correctional Association of New York, which monitors prisons. ''She is obviously trying to make a big splash to draw attention to this. But the main power is with the governor, the Legislature and prosecutors, and she has no authority over them.''</p>
        <p>The judge's plan is an outgrowth of a report she commissioned on drug addiction and imprisonment, which cited a state estimate that 67 percent of all state prisoners are addicts. Noting that drug treatment cuts down significantly on recidivism compared to incarceration, Judge Kaye called for creating more specialized drug courts, whose judges would screen and assess defendants and refer some nonviolent offenders to drug treatment programs.</p>
        <p>The judge has full authority to create those courts. But she cannot compel prosecutors to make use of them. And while some prosecutors actively support drug treatment an alternative to incarceration, others are wary.</p>
        <p>''You've got to think about people in the community,'' said Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney. ''You can't say that anybody willy-nilly, who is an addict and committed a crime, is going to go into a treatment program. We've long supported more money for treatment. But I'm not one to jump into something not knowing all the details and I don't know what they are at this point. This is not a simple process.''</p>
        <p>Another difficulty is sentencing. Judge Kaye's plan cannot alter mandatory minimum prison sentences -- including the so-called Rockefeller drug laws -- which rob judges of all discretion. Only the State Legislature can change the sentencing guidelines, and it once again declined to do so last week.</p>
        <p>Those sentences are for felonies. Defendants who plead guilty to misdemeanors could be be offered drug treatment instead of imprisonment.</p>
        <p>BUT the court system is so crowded and short of judges now that light or even suspended sentences are the norm for misdemeanants. Why would they agree to a year or two of drug treatment instead? Jonathan Lippman, the state's chief administrative judge, says that drug court judges would use the specter of tough sentences to pressure the defendants into choosing drug programs. But would that pressure tactic survive the inevitable challenges of defense lawyers?</p>
        <p>There are questions also about cost; Judge Kaye predicts large savings from her plan once it is in effect. But wouldn't it need resources up front from a balky State Legislature?</p>
        <p>''It would appear she is missing some things -- like money and D.A. consent,'' said Assemblyman Jeffrion L. Aubry, a Democrat from Queens and a leading critic of mandatory sentences. ''I'm encouraged. She is sending a fairly strong message from the judiciary that what we are doing now is not working. But there are a lot of questions here. I don't know what the availability for treatment is, and I would think she needs money to create drug courts.''</p>
        <p>Judge Lippman said that with its annual budget of $1.5 billion, the court system could finance the initiative without additional funds, and he believes there is enough space in drug treatment programs for many additional patients. But others predict that the judiciary would have to seek new appropriations from the Legislature -- which only last week rejected New York City's plea for more family and criminal court judges.</p>
        <p>All of which has led many in the criminal justice system to suggest that Judge Kaye's announcement will have greater impact as a moral declaration than as a practical program. It matters that state's most prestigious jurist considers the imprisonment of many addicts to be unfair, ineffective and costly. But enough to win over her fiercely independent partners?</p>
        <p>''This has a lot of merit,'' said Assemblyman Aubry. ''In theory.''</p>
