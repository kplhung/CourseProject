        <p>Notes flew from the stage of Carnegie Hall at the JVC Jazz Festival concert on Wednesday night in streaks, in flurries, in torrents. The pianists Michel Camilo and Chucho Valdes and the flamenco guitarist Tomatito were all delineating the diverse uses of speed. They applied breakneck velocity for sheer momentum and for lavish ornamentation; they also drew from it a shimmering, pointillistic delicacy that offered tranquillity within all the fast finger work.</p>
        <p>The concert began with duets by Mr. Camilo, who is from the Dominican Republic, and Tomatito, one of Spain's most respected flamenco innovators. After working together occasionally since 1997, they have just released a duet album, ''Spain'' (Verve), and they played material from it in extended, more searching versions. Their main model is Chick Corea's flamenco-influenced compositions like ''Spain,'' which was their finale; fast pieces were articulate dialogues of nimble, scampering lines.</p>

        <p>Notes flew from the stage of Carnegie Hall at the JVC Jazz Festival concert on Wednesday night in streaks, in flurries, in torrents. The pianists Michel Camilo and Chucho Valdes and the flamenco guitarist Tomatito were all delineating the diverse uses of speed. They applied breakneck velocity for sheer momentum and for lavish ornamentation; they also drew from it a shimmering, pointillistic delicacy that offered tranquillity within all the fast finger work.</p>
        <p>The concert began with duets by Mr. Camilo, who is from the Dominican Republic, and Tomatito, one of Spain's most respected flamenco innovators. After working together occasionally since 1997, they have just released a duet album, ''Spain'' (Verve), and they played material from it in extended, more searching versions. Their main model is Chick Corea's flamenco-influenced compositions like ''Spain,'' which was their finale; fast pieces were articulate dialogues of nimble, scampering lines.</p>
        <p>Each took a solo. Mr. Camilo started with a pristine waltz and turned percussive, playing a hard-charging salsa vamp with one hand and topping it with an extra layer of bristling chords. Tomatito extended a traditional flamenco bulerias toward jazz harmony, with shivering strummed chords and steely runs that were filled with a restless passion.</p>
        <p>Their ballads were most memorable. In the theme of Rodrigo's ''Concierto de Aranjuez,'' Mr. Camilo's ''Two Much'' and a pensive, Debussy-tinged reworking of ''Besame Mucho,'' the two musicians set out luminous melodies and surrounded them with arpeggios or darting guitar lines, so that each phrase spawned ripples like a pebble dropped in a still pond. Together the duo found an elusive grace.</p>
        <p>Mr. Valdes and his quartet began each tune -- standards like ''My Funny Valentine'' and ''Embraceable You'' -- by calmly setting out the melody with a few decorous chords. Then he let loose dizzying transformations: zooming through long octave-leaping lines and two-part counterpoint, splashing big Romantic chords up and down the keyboard, hammering at dissonant clusters, sweeping through glissandos and sometimes, as a final escalation, shifting into Afro-Cuban dance rhythms. (Ramses Manuel Rodriguez Bazalt, on drums, had a foot pedal to play clave patterns on a wood block.) The music was volatile and exhilarating as it exulted in possibilities.</p>
        <p>In a few closing duets, Mr. Valdes and Mr. Camilo chased each other across the keyboards like dueling stunt pilots. Long, fast lines were answered by faster curlicues; elaborate reharmonizations were trumped and trumped again. In ''The Peanut Vendor,'' the two pianists' rhythmic chords meshed into a prismatic double exposure. Competition merged with virtuoso camaraderie, all in a rush of notes.</p>
