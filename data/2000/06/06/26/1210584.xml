        <p>A young student of tennis history, Alexandra Stevenson knows there are only two precedents for what she did last year at Wimbledon, where she qualified into the main draw and then served and curtsied her way to the semifinals.</p>
        <p>The first precedent is John McEnroe, who reached the Wimbledon semifinals after qualifying for the tournament in his first appearance in 1977. The second precedent is Christine Matison, who qualified and reached the semifinals at the Australian Open in 1978 and is the only other female qualifier to get that far in a Grand Slam event.</p>

        <p>A young student of tennis history, Alexandra Stevenson knows there are only two precedents for what she did last year at Wimbledon, where she qualified into the main draw and then served and curtsied her way to the semifinals.</p>
        <p>The first precedent is John McEnroe, who reached the Wimbledon semifinals after qualifying for the tournament in his first appearance in 1977. The second precedent is Christine Matison, who qualified and reached the semifinals at the Australian Open in 1978 and is the only other female qualifier to get that far in a Grand Slam event.</p>
        <p>All tennis fans know McEnroe; precious few know Matison. The question as Stevenson prepares to return to the scene of her climb is: Whose company she will belong in? Is she, like McEnroe, destined for greatness, or is she, like Matison, destined to be a footnote?</p>
        <p>The early returns hardly have McEnroe looking over his shoulder. In her first full season on tour, Stevenson, now 19, has won eight matches and lost 16. She has not advanced past the quarterfinals in any event and has lost in the first round of all three Grand Slam tournaments she has competed in since Wimbledon. In her final two grass-court tuneups before Wimbledon begins on Monday, she lost in the first round to Shinobu Asagoe of Japan in Birmingham and to Anne Kremer of Luxembourg in Eastbourne.</p>
        <p>Though Stevenson's ranking remains a respectable 42, that is only because of the huge bundle of points she accumulated last year at the All England Lawn Tennis Club. If she loses early there this year, her ranking could quickly be in the triple digits again.</p>
        <p>But Stevenson, who said she has experienced ostracism and frustration this year on tour along with the joys of competing in the world's great cities and stadiums, was upbeat about her present and her future in a telephone interview from Eastbourne on Friday, shortly after finishing a two-hour grass-court practice session with the Wimbledon grande dame Martina Navratilova.</p>
        <p>Yes, it has been tougher, lonelier and cattier than she expected on the women's circuit. Yes, it rankles her when the French player Nathalie Tauziat heaps extensive criticism on her and her mother, Samantha, in Tauziat's recent book about life on the tour. No, she does not regret her decision to decline a tennis scholarship to U.C.L.A. and take her chances and lumps as a teenage professional.</p>
        <p>''I don't even look at my results and say, 'Wow, this has been a horrible year,' like all the writers like to say, or 'a nightmarish year,' and I could go on and on,'' Stevenson said. ''I stopped reading anything, because I think it's stupid. I don't look at results. I just look at how I'm playing on the court and progressing. I'm much smarter than I was even a month ago.''</p>
        <p>Stevenson is not the only 1999 Wimbledon sensation who has yet to use her performance as a springboard into the game's elite. Mirjana Lucic, the powerful but erratic Croat who also reached the semifinals at the All England Club despite being ranked 134th, has struggled much more than Stevenson and is ranked 58th.</p>
        <p>Jelena Dokic, the Yugoslav-born Australian who stunned a distracted Martina Hingis, 6-2, 6-0, in the first round at Wimbledon and lost to Stevenson in the quarterfinals, has fared better. Currently ranked No. 29, she defeated the top-20 players Sandrine Testud and Anna Kournikova in Fed Cup play this spring and reached the quarterfinals at Hilton Head, S.C. But she has won only one match in her last three Grand Slam events.</p>
        <p>So was it merely the unusual nature of Wimbledon -- the only significant tournament played on grass -- that allowed the big-hitting teenagers to burst briefly to the fore? Stevenson happily concedes that she relishes playing on the game's slickest, quickest surface, but her on-court difficulties have not simply been a question of changing topography.</p>
        <p>While other phenoms, like Hingis, spent the bulk of their teenage years as professionals, Stevenson spent the bulk of her late adolescence juggling tennis and high school.</p>
        <p>''What's exciting in my mind is she's very young on court,'' said her new coach, Brian Gottfried, whom the Stevensons hired in March. ''Although she's been around the world, whereas a lot of juniors might have grown up playing four hours a day, she was pretty much limited to one and a half hours a day, and very little on clay and different surfaces.''</p>
        <p>Stevenson has now had plenty of exposure to publicity, however. Before last year's Wimbledon, she was a household name only in Southern California tennis circles. But then came her remarkable run at Wimbledon and the remarkable revelation -- against her and her mother's wishes -- that the basketball great Julius Erving is her father.</p>
        <p>Samantha Stevenson's outspokenness during the tournament only increased her daughter's visibility. In interviews, Samantha alluded to racism on tour that had been directed at her mixed-race daughter and at her black friends Venus and Serena Williams. She also criticized the women's circuit as a nightmare because of the petty and unprofessional infighting that, in her opinion, characterized it.</p>
        <p>Other players now know a great deal more about Alexandra Stevenson than she knows about them.</p>
        <p>''I didn't really realize that until I was talking to Venus in Rome, and she told me, 'Everyone wants to beat you now, and so you have to go out and be tough, because they especially want to beat you because you got the attention and you have a personality, and they want to kill you on the court, so they are going to come out playing their best tennis,' '' Stevenson said. ''And then I started realizing, you know she's right. They'll be playing me awesome and then the next day after they beat me, they'll lose and won't be playing the same, and I didn't really understand that. So now I'm learning. If you look at anyone's first year, they don't win that much. It takes time.''</p>
        <p>She has not always given herself plenty of it. One of her dreams was to win Wimbledon by the time she turned 19, the age she is now.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to go back to win it,'' Stevenson said, despite her recent results. ''To play great tennis and do the same thing I did last year: entertain the crowd.''</p>
