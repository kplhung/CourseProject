        <p>When Lee Trevino was a young golfer, the public course he played on was so poor it couldn't afford bunkers.</p>
        <p>Now, he revels in sand.</p>
        <p>He got lucky today with a shot from a bunker on the 17th hole that  hit high on the flagstick with a clang and stayed on the green, staving off a potential disaster, and then he deliberately wound up in the sand on 18. He could have laid up to protect his lead, but instead tried to drive the green with his second shot on the par 5, expecting to land in the sand. He birdied the final hole to preserve a rare Senior Tour wire-to-wire victory in the Cadillac N.F.L. Golf Classic.</p>
        <p>At 60 years 6 months, Trevino became the ninth 60-year-old to capture a senior event. He had not won in more than two years. But this was an old-fashioned course -- ''vintage,'' he called the narrow, flat affair -- and it was as if he were transported back to his glory days of the 1970's.</p>
        <p>His 69 today gave him a three-day total of 14-under-par 202, which tied the record for the event, as he finished two shots better than Walter Hall. Three others tied for third, a shot further back.</p>
        <p>The way Trevino won -- essentially, deliberately putting himself in a position in which many golfers would hyperventilate -- was surprising to the other golfers. But certainly not to him.</p>
        <p>He went to the tee at 18 nursing a one-stroke lead. He had bogeyed 17 with that bizarre shot out of the sand that was saved by the flag as it headed for the crowd beyond the green. He had bogeyed 16 as well after coming into today with only one bogey in the first two rounds.</p>
        <p>Then he struck his tee shot on 18, and it went down the middle of the fairway.</p>
        <p>''It's over,'' he recalled saying to himself. For he knew that from there, he would deliberately land in the bunker.</p>
        <p>Even Hall, in the clubhouse, understood that Trevino was unbeatable from the sand.</p>
        <p>''Worst case,'' Hall said, ''he hits it onto the green 10 feet from the pin and makes a par. He probably would hit it 5 feet for a birdie.''</p>
        <p>And that was what Trevino did.</p>
        <p>Trevino's love for the beach came late in life, he said.</p>
        <p>''I was almost 28 when I joined the PGA Tour,'' he recalled. ''I went to the best bunker player on the tour -- Gary Player.'' The South African taught the Texan how to nurse the ball in the sand, and Trevino spent hours perfecting that aspect of his game.</p>
        <p>This was Trevino's 29th victory on the Senior Tour to go with the 27 he had on the regular tour. He said he has changed his swing and his putting style in recent weeks and claimed he can play with anyone -- on the right course.</p>
        <p>Such a course, he said, was next week's Senior Open at Saucon Valley Country Club in Bethlehem, Pa. But he said he would withdraw from next month's British Open if the course is too tough.</p>
        <p>''I'll take a practice round and if I don't like it, I'll give my spot to a younger guy,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But this was his course today. And perhaps thinking about the $165,000 check he would pocket, he yelled out to the crowd at the Upper Montclair Country Club after his final putt rolled in, ''I'm going to buy me a house down the street.''</p>
        <p>CHIP SHOTS</p>
        <p>WALTER MORGAN, who hits his drives while chomping on a cigar, produced his best finish in two years by capturing sixth place with a final-round 71. TOM WATSON increased his par-or-better streak to 15 rounds by firing a 67. Watson finished at 209. . . . ALLEN DOYLE, who captured this event as a rookie last year and went into the final day tied with Trevino, shot a par 72 to tie for third. Two of his putts wound up sitting on the lip but failed to drop. . . . ARNOLD PALMER's final-round 76 placed him in a three-way tie for next to last at 233. . . . The best round in the tournament's history was generated by REX CALDWELL, who shot a 64 Sunday, including a 30 on the back nine.On Saturday, Caldwell shot an 80.</p>
