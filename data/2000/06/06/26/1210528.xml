        <p>The unexpected resignation late last week of Bill Mechanic as head of the 20th Century Fox movie studio, coming after a period of growing discord between him and Rupert Murdoch, whose News Corporation owns Fox, puts a firm end to a period of relative calm in the revolving-door world of top studio executives.</p>
        <p>Hollywood was already buzzing about whether the sale of the Seagram Company to Vivendi S.A., announced earlier last week, would mean a change in leadership of the 81-year-old Universal Studios, a Seagram property. And top executives at both Walt Disney and Warner Brothers were still settling into their jobs after top management shifts the last year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murdoch was said to have been upset over the dark tone of some of Fox's recent films, like ''Fight Club'' and ''The Beach,'' but even more upset that the films had performed poorly at the box office. ''The Beach,'' the Leonardo DiCaprio return to the screen after ''Titanic,'' did well overseas but was weak in the United States. Fox's big Christmas holiday release, ''Anna and the King,'' also cost a bundle and performed poorly, as did ''Titan A.E.,'' an expensive animated feature (estimates of its cost run from $85 million to $100 million) that earned only $9.2 million in its opening weekend, a dismal performance for a potential summer blockbuster.</p>
        <p>The relationship between Mr. Murdoch and Mr. Mechanic began to sour after ''Fight Club,'' which opened last fall, a violent fantasy starring Brad Pitt that attracted vehement champions and equally vehement critics.</p>
        <p>''At a certain point, you're just headed on that inevitable path where it's not working,'' Mr. Mechanic said in an interview late last week.</p>
        <p>So, he added, he began to meet with people to discuss what he might do if he left Fox, including starting his own production company, much as the former Disney executive Joe Roth did when he left that studio six months ago. Mr. Mechanic's resignation caught so many here by surprise, two Fox executives said, because he had not intended to announce it so soon. Someone released word of it to news organizations on Thursday afternoon.</p>
        <p>Coming last week after the box-office failure of ''Titan A.E.,'' Mr. Mechanic's departure looked like just another case of an executive being forced out after a string of failures, a common Hollywood story. Had the announcement been delayed until after the opening on Friday of the Jim Carrey comedy ''Me, Myself and Irene,'' which is expected to do very well at the box office, it might have come across differently.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mechanic, who has been a top executive at Fox since 1993, said he intended to spend several weeks deciding whether to form his own company or, perhaps, return to an executive job at another studio.</p>
        <p>''I like studios,'' he said. ''I like the history of studios. I like the camaraderie of the thing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mechanic said of his departure, ''For me personally, it's very good. For me emotionally, it's kind of devastating and devastating to the people I work with.''</p>
        <p>Peter Chernin, president of the News Corporation, said that it might be several weeks before a replacement is named. In the interim, Fox executives said, Mr. Chernin intended to play a close role in supervising the studio's operations.</p>
        <p>So now attention shifts to Mr. Mechanic's successor. Many here are predicting that Mr. Murdoch and Mr. Chernin will select an in-house candidate, possibly Tom Sherak, a seasoned Hollywood executive and the studio's distribution wizard, or Tom Rothman, who started the studio's small-film division, Fox Searchlight, before being named president of its film group last year.</p>
