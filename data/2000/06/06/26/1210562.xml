        <p>WE became starkly aware of Mike Tyson's appetites when he chewed off part of Evander Holyfield's ear three years ago. Now, Tyson says, he wants Lennox Lewis's heart, and craves to eat Lewis's children, too. One's first impulse is to tell Tyson: Curb your diet. Try broccoli.</p>
        <p>But with Tyson, jokes soon become lame. And a sense of sadness, of ugliness, of dread, creeps in sickeningly. He is the closest thing we have to a national boogeyman.</p>
        <p>After knocking out Lou Savarese on Saturday night in 38 seconds of the first round of a bout in Hampden Park in Glasgow, Tyson was asked if he had a message for Lewis, the recognized heavyweight champion of the world. Tyson, the former title-holder, replied: ''I want your heart. I want to eat your children -- I want to rip out his heart and feed it to him.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''I want to kill people. I want to rip their stomachs out and eat their children.'' So, Lewis shouldn't take this personally.</p>
        <p>Tyson's victory over Savarese wasn't just a simple knockout. Nothing Tyson does is simple, unless assorted forms of mayhem may be deemed simple in that they are uncomplicated examples of bizarre behavior.</p>
        <p>A left hook to the top of the head in the first six seconds of Saturday's fight toppled the 6-foot-5-inch, 241-pound Savarese, who is some 7 inches and 20 pounds larger than Tyson. Tyson then waded in with the ferocity of something out of ''Animal Kingdom.'' When the referee, John Coyle, jumped between the fighters to stop the bout, he didn't realize he was taking his life in his hands.</p>
        <p>Tyson knocked the referee down with another left and climbed over his body, so eager was he to stomp Savarese into a mashed potato. Or, as Iron Mike said on another occasion, wishing to punch his opponent's nose bone up into his brain to kill him.</p>
        <p>To say the least, this goes beyond sport.</p>
        <p>Yet, regardless of what he does and how he does it -- from a rape conviction to kicking an older man in the groin during a traffic dispute to savoring a fleshy lobe -- the mass of us are attracted, despite our best instincts, to Tyson's next fight. Each time we say: ''This is it. Never again.''</p>
        <p>But then, well, Tyson takes home $8 million from the Savarese fight, and Tyson's manager, Shelly Finkel, proclaims that a Lewis-Tyson title fight will be the greatest moneymaker in pugilistic history. This may not be utter bombast. There is no end to rubberneckers after an accident on the road. Or at our absorption in the chilling accounts of a plane crash. Or flocking to ''The Blair Witch Project,'' offspring of ''Bride of Frankenstein.''</p>
        <p>How to explain it? Maybe it brings us close to an edge. It is obviously both titillating and sobering. After all, there but for the grace of a deity -- or some other director -- go I.</p>
        <p>Perhaps one of our greatest fears is to open a closet in our minds and find Tyson hulking there. Maybe that's what Dr. Jekyll did. Proust said that there are a thousand selves in each of us. When Gustave Flaubert was asked whom Emma Bovary, his novelistic creation, was based on, he answered, ''C'est moi.'' More accurately, possibly, a part of moi, a frightening part. One's shadowy doppelganger.</p>
        <p>Tyson also said after the fight: ''I'm the best, the most brutal, vicious and ruthless champion there's ever been. I am Sonny Liston. I am Jack Dempsey. There's no one who can stop me.''</p>
        <p>The brutal, ruthless part seems hard to challenge. After all, no Liston fight comes to mind in which he acted as outrageously as Tyson within the confines of the sport, and the ring. Liston, with menacing mien, dispatched his opponents with devastating blows and then departed the premises quietly to down a beer and a steak.</p>
        <p>Dempsey was a slugging champ, forever savage in the classic painting by George Bellows when knocking Luis Firpo through the ropes. And old films show Dempsey hovering over the fallen Gene Tunney, in the legendary Battle of the Long Count in 1927. But a new rule had been instituted in which a fighter after knocking down his opponent was required to go to a neutral corner before the count began. Dempsey had forgotten, then moved away quickly when waved off by the referee. The Manassa Mauler didn't move fast enough, however, and his hesitation allowed Tunney to rise and go on to win a decision, retaining the title.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Dempsey's appetites, in contrast to Tyson's, seemed to incline toward dairy. Upon retirement, Dempsey opened a restaurant on Broadway, which was celebrated for its cheesecake.</p>
        <p>''Mike went in with a lot of anger,'' Finkel said, seeking to explain Tyson's attempts to continue to pummel Savarese when the fight had clearly been terminated. ''The fight didn't go long enough for him to get all his anger out.''</p>
        <p>Some anger, some explanation. But now where does Tyson's pent-up fury go? The ring has proved to be too confining for it. He has already spent years in prison. He has already lain on a psychiatrist's couch. Is he beyond help? Who knows?</p>
        <p>It seems not unlikely that somewhere, somehow, he will do something even more terrible than he has in the past, and achieve his expressed wish for slaughter.</p>
        <p>One can only hope, however, that in the end his pronouncements are more metaphor than fact, and not inevitable.</p>
