        <p>The leaders of the political party that created apartheid in South Africa decided this weekend to dissolve the organization officially, agreeing to merge with a rival party to create a new entity that is likely to attract most of that country's white, Indian and mixed-race voters.</p>
        <p>The marriage of the two groups means the formal demise of the National Party, which ruled South Africa for more than 40 years but has struggled to find its place and audience in the post-apartheid era.</p>
        <p>In late 1998, the National Party rechristened itself the New National Party as its leaders sought to attract nonwhite voters and to distance themselves from the party's racist past. But the party's troubles only deepened as it lost ground to its rival, the Democratic Party.</p>
        <p>In the last national elections, the party finished with only about 7 percent of the vote, down from 20 percent in 1994, as its core group of supporters, white Afrikaners, jumped ship for the Democratic Party, which has become the pre-eminent party among whites.</p>
        <p>And in recent months the defections have continued. Dozens of members of the New National Party, which now receives much of its support from mixed-race communities, have flocked to the Democratic Party, which won nearly 10 percent of the vote in last year's elections, up from 1.7 percent in 1994.</p>
        <p>On Saturday, the two competing parties announced that they would merge into a new organization called the Democratic Alliance. The fledgling political party is still no match for the governing African National Congress, which battled the apartheid government and still enjoys wide support among the black majority, winning just over 66 percent of the vote in 1999.</p>
        <p>But with the fierce battles for white voters behind them, the leaders of the new party say they can now turn their attention toward building support in the black community and to winning city council races in the upcoming local elections, scheduled for November.</p>
        <p>''We don't see it as an end; we see it as the beginning of a new dawn,'' Daryl Swanepoel, the deputy executive director of the New National Party, said in a telephone interview this evening.</p>
        <p>''The ideal of realigning South African politics is something that we have been driving for,'' Mr. Swanepoel said. ''A lot of energy and financial resources was being wasted on the opposition fighting the opposition. Together, we can now expand into the black community.''</p>
        <p>The merger was praised today by former President F.W. de Klerk, who led the National Party and tried to transform it into a nonracial party, and denounced by the African National Congress. A.N.C. officials described the union as an attempt to preserve white privilege and said that it would further polarize the country.</p>
        <p>''We say good luck to this alliance of hate, which is totally unprincipled,'' Smuts Ngonyama, the spokesman for the A.N,C., told local reporters today.</p>
        <p>It is true that in luring supporters, both the Democratic Party and the New National Party have played on the fears of South African minority groups -- whites, mixed-race people known as ''coloreds'' and Indians -- who still have most of South Africa's wealth but worry about having no say in the government.</p>
        <p>But in an effort to broaden their support base among blacks, the leaders of the Democratic Alliance say they have also reached out to Bantu Holomisa, a black former African National Congress official and the leader of the United Democratic Movement, a small, struggling political party which promotes racial reconciliation.</p>
        <p>The man who will now lead the Democratic Alliance is Tony Leon, who has been the leader of the Democratic Party, which has won the support of most white voters with its sharp criticism of the government and its attacks on affirmative action and corruption. He said that Mr. Holomisa has declined for the time being.</p>
        <p>But he is hopeful that Mr. Holomisa will reconsider.</p>
        <p>''If this movement is to do anything at all it really has to get involved in black politics,'' said Mr. Leon.</p>
        <p>Marthinus van Schalkwyk, the New National Party chief, will serve as Mr. Leon's deputy.</p>
        <p>''The idea from our point of view was to move on to take on the A.N.C. on the battlefront which counts, which is the majority vote,'' Mr. Leon said in an interview.</p>
