        <p>MOST visitors go to the National Portrait Gallery to look at the pictures. But one guide stresses the building itself, ''arguably the finest public building in America.'' Speaking of the architect Robert Mills, he says: ''It is his masterwork. It is his Parthenon.'' The site matters, too, at the right angle of a triangle down F Street to Mills's Treasury building, down Eighth Street, where the Ionic columns of the 1930's National Archives building face the Corinthian columns of what was built a century before. The third side is Pennsylvania Avenue, stretching from the Capitol to the White House -- or, as President George Washington called it in presenting Pierre L'Enfant's plan to Congress, ''the Grand Avenue connecting both the palace and the federal house.''</p>
        <p>Details pour out. In the L'Enfant plan, the site had been reserved for a national cathedral. Instead President Andrew Jackson used the site for the patent office -- ''not a bad substitute for a republic,'' the guide observes. And when patents were no longer worshiped, around 1952, the building was almost torn down so a vast parking garage could replace it.</p>

        <p>MOST visitors go to the National Portrait Gallery to look at the pictures. But one guide stresses the building itself, ''arguably the finest public building in America.'' Speaking of the architect Robert Mills, he says: ''It is his masterwork. It is his Parthenon.'' The site matters, too, at the right angle of a triangle down F Street to Mills's Treasury building, down Eighth Street, where the Ionic columns of the 1930's National Archives building face the Corinthian columns of what was built a century before.

Instead President Andrew Jackson used the site for the patent office -- ''not a bad substitute for a republic,'' the guide observes. And when patents were no longer worshiped, around 1952, the building was almost torn down so a vast parking garage could replace it.</p>
        <p>Daniel Patrick Moynihan, 73, the Senate's Renaissance intellectual, is showing off the rebirth of that grand avenue that Washington wanted ''most magnificent &amp; most convenient.''</p>
        <p>New York's retiring senior senator may be better known for a dedication to getting New York taxpayers more of their money back from Washington, a deep understanding of welfare and Social Security and an intense internationalism (he called the pending Senate action on trade with China ''one of the half-dozen most important votes of the postwar era''). But if it is too much to call the renewal of Pennsylvania Avenue his monument, it is fair to think of him as its inspired political general contractor -- the constant in the process that has involved several plans and eight presidencies through several recessions and one war.</p>
        <p>President Washington wanted the avenue ''built up at once.'' Its south side filled with government buildings in the 20's, though in fact it saw only their rear entrances; their front doors faced the Mall. And those buildings closed at night. As Mr. Moynihan said at Seventh Street: ''When we started this, the only light at night between the Capitol and the White House, save for the Occidental Restaurant, was Apex Liquors, which was right here. And this also was Mathew Brady's studio, on the top floor.''</p>
        <p>Today the twin towers of the Apex building remain, but they are surrounded by activity. ''Outdoor cafes are everywhere,'' the senator said. ''And there are always a few sailors around,'' drawn to a particular point of pride for the World War II sailor himself, the flowing fountains, granite map and larger-than-life ''Lone Sailor'' of Stanley Bleifeld's Navy Memorial. When Mr. Moynihan talks of ''when we started this,'' he means 1961, when he was an assistant labor secretary in John F. Kennedy's administration under Arthur J. Goldberg.</p>
        <p>MR. MOYNIHAN wrote the first policy statement in 1962, calling for needed new buildings (nothing had been built since the 30's) ''in an architectural style and form which is distinguished and which will reflect the dignity, enterprise, vigor and stability of the American National Government,'' with emphasis on ''the choice of designs that embody the finest contemporary American architectural thought.'' President Kennedy made this government policy.</p>
        <p>In the following decades, Mr. Moynihan played a variety of roles -- including one he still enjoys, as occupant of a new apartment on the avenue. When he investigated what could be preserved, he recalls, he found eight-foot shrubs growing inside the Pension building and bat dung on the ladders in the old Post Office tower. As an adviser to Richard Nixon on urban affairs, he brought the new president's support to what might have been discarded as a Kennedy-Johnson project. As a senator for the last 24 years, he came to deal with public buildings and finally made a reality of the International Trade Center at 14th Street, between the avenue and the Mall, the last piece of the Federal Triangle that Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon had seen to in the 20's.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moynihan's ability to work with Republicans as well as Democrats, though it sometimes frustrates fellow Democrats of stronger partisanship, is central to his work on the avenue. One telling example: House Speaker Newt Gingrich was appalled at the cost of James Ingo Freed's trade center. Mr. Moynihan says durability requires government buildings to cost more than K Street office blocks: ''If you want a 200-year building, you've got to pay more.'' But that wasn't the decisive argument, not in political Washington. The crucial moment was when Mr. Moynihan seized on a California Republican's bill to name the building for Ronald Reagan and got it passed. Opposition vanished.</p>
        <p>As guide, Mr. Moynihan also stopped at what he likes least about Pennsylvania Avenue today -- the concrete barriers shaped like ugly flower pots that closed it off in front of the White House in 1995. ''Somehow,'' he said in the Jefferson Lecture at the University of Virginia in April, ''we have got to recover our nerve, shaken really since Nov. 22, 1963.''</p>
        <p>Those barriers of horrid design remain on his mind over a crab cake lunch in a chic restaurant in the Reagan building. The tour finished and the architectural and bureaucratic success stories told, he is somber when asked if he is satisfied with four decades of work on the avenue. ''No,'' he says, ''this avenue is not finished until it is open.''</p>
