        <p>From the rare city with a radio talk show devoted to track and field:</p>
        <p>On July 23, Maurice Greene's 26th birthday, the world's fastest man at 100 meters and 1999 world champion at 200 meters should face Michael Johnson, the Olympic champion and world record-holder at 200 meters, in the marquee matchup at the Olympic trials.</p>
        <p>They have raced only once at 200 meters, in 1998. Greene won. His time of 19.93 seconds here on Saturday was within one-hundredth of a second of the fastest time Johnson has run at sea level since he set the world record of 19.32 seconds at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.</p>
        <p>Greene, his coach John Smith and his agent Emanuel Hudson do not believe that Johnson can replicate that time because the Atlanta track was so hard as to be nearly illegal and because there will not be another Olympics in the United States before he retires.</p>
        <p>Johnson believes that Greene is impudent and not properly respectful. Smith is concerned that Greene may try to run too fast at the trials, which could be costly physically and emotionally for the Olympic final on Sept. 28 in Sydney, Australia. The following talk-show format is fictitious, but the remarks have been made this season.</p>
        <p>MAURICE FROM LOS ANGELES -- Michael Johnson is just another man, not the Superman everyone says he is.</p>
        <p>MICHAEL FROM DALLAS -- I think that Maurice isn't mature enough. He hasn't been in this sport long enough to really understand that talking isn't going to make him feel better. I'm still the world record-holder. I've run probably 20 times faster than his fastest 200.</p>
        <p>EMANUEL FROM IRVINE -- In my opinion, Michael Johnson will fold. Michael is stealing time. It's unfortunate he can't go out with dignity. He has to take a shot. It's insecure, immature. It sounds like they see the changing of the guard.</p>
        <p>MICHAEL FROM DALLAS -- I don't really look at it as though they don't give me the respect I'm due, but I tell you what, they know better than to get in a race with me unprepared. That's enough respect for me.</p>
        <p>JOHN FROM LOS ANGELES -- The track in Atlanta was almost illegal. It had the widest bends you can have. It was Michael's day. You probably get one of those in a lifetime. I don't discount it. But as a coach, I don't look at peak, I look at consistency. Day in and day out, Michael is a 19.90, 19.85, 19.80 sprinter. If we run 19.90, 19.85, we're in the mix.</p>
        <p>MICHAEL FROM DALLAS -- There's a difference between thinking you're going to win and not respecting someone else and what they've done. Maurice, I read a comment where he said I only broke the world record in Atlanta because the track was fast. He would have broken the world record had he run on the track. Woulda, woulda, woulda. All this woulda is silly. Maurice Greene is the best 100-meter runner I've ever seen. I have no problem saying that. Two hundred meters is a different story. But Maurice Greene can't say, 'Michael Johnson is the greatest 200-meter runner I've ever seen and he broke the world record and it was impressive.' He can't say that. That's his problem.</p>
        <p>MAURICE FROM LOS ANGELES -- This is how I see the Olympic trials -- it's a semifinal. It's not the final. Whatever happens doesn't matter. We're just trying to get to the Olympics.</p>
        <p>JOHN FROM LOS ANGELES -- I'm not concerned with winning or losing the trials. My main concern is what it's going to cost for them to try to beat each other. You have two guys, two of the fiercest competitors ever to participate in track and field. Neither wants to lose. But the real race is in September, not July.</p>
        <p>You've got to be careful when you pick fights. You're body has got to be ready.</p>
        <p>MICHAEL FROM DALLAS -- That is a danger for them. That is not a danger for me. My concern is going in there, making the Olympic team and winning. Third place at the trials is not good enough for me. I'm not going to tell you that all I've got to do is make the team. I'm better than that. I need to go in there and win and go to the Games and win.</p>
        <p>MAURICE FROM LOS ANGELES -- I'll win the trials.</p>
        <p>MICHAEL FROM DALLAS -- It isn't a race between me and Maurice. It's a race against seven other guys. How do we know Maurice is even going to be there? When I get to those finals, I've got to beat seven other guys. They don't have faces or names to me. They're just people standing in my way.</p>
