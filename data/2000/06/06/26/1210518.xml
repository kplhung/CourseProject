        <p>The Victorians will not let us treat them as equals. The Elizabethans are like rowdy, untrammeled ancestors. And 20th-century modernists are the elder siblings we keep analyzing and competing with, afraid that we're still in their shadow.</p>

        <p>The Victorians will not let us treat them as equals. The Elizabethans are like rowdy, untrammeled ancestors. And 20th-century modernists are the elder siblings we keep analyzing and competing with, afraid that we're still in their shadow.</p>
        <p>Let us not underestimate the effect of Victorian garb on us. Clothes encased men and women and imposed stillness, even majesty, on them. Men's calves were attractive in narrow pants; so were women's upper torsos, thanks to nipped waists that emphasized the closely covered breasts. (Perhaps I should say ''bosom.'') But after that a certain sartorial censorship set in. There were long flared coats and billowing floor-length skirts, which hid if not erased unduly precise thoughts about body parts.</p>
        <p>But of course it is Victorian writing that keeps threatening to infantilize us. Literature, art, politics -- whatever the subject -- they were ubiquitous and omniscient. Whatever the emotion, too: passion, wit, melancholy, outrage. The Victorians' very doubts had the force of commandments, while their nonsense employed the rhymes and rhythms of high logic. And even now, when we know so much about things they could or would not acknowledge, and when we know so much about their private frailties and agonies, their will to work and to master still astonishes us. They rose from their sick beds and their nervous collapses to go on searching for what they considered noble, truthful and beautiful.</p>
        <p>It was a Gilbert and Sullivan binge that set me going this time, that and a a very good play about John Ruskin, the visionary art and social critic, and his marriage to Euphemia Gray, a spirited young woman who dared to find him wanting as a husband-companion and a fully realized human being. Like those of many Americans, my relations with Gilbert and Sullivan began in elementary school. But we were reintroduced last year by Mike Leigh's wonderful movie ''Topsy-Turvy,'' which, if you haven't seen it, could be subtitled: ''Behind the Scenes in Victorian England: The Triumphant Art and Complicated Lives of W. S. Gilbert, Arthur Sullivan and the D'Oyly Carte Actors, Who Brought a Fantasy of Imperial Japan to the British Empire.'' When you're young, you're not just playing in a Gilbert and Sullivan operetta; you're playing with it. It's a sophisticated toy given to you by adults, one that allows you to display abilities that adults like to hog for themselves: verbal mastery, excellent timing and perfect control of life from romance to ambition to grief (well modulated, rapidly assuaged grief).</p>
        <p>And all the better that this mimicry takes place in fantasy settings. First, of course, the topsy-turvy plots, in which Anglo-Saxons play at being Japanese (''The Mikado''), Italian (''The Gondoliers'') and half-castes who are half-human and half-fairy (''Iolanthe''). And then, in the United States anyway, the topsy-turvy ethnicities of the cast joined the Anglo-Saxons with African, Jewish, Asian and Hispanic Saxons.</p>
        <p>Gilbert's tales are full of orphans too, cheerful, grown-up orphans who usually find their true parents and their true loves at the same time and live happily ever after with both. No Freudian family romances to trouble us here.</p>
        <p>And so it's very strange to meet Gilbert and Sullivan in the movie as adults at last who are coping with all the things we cope with: doubts about our work and its value, marriages of polite desolation and affairs of convenience.</p>
        <p>The lighthearted pleasures of the traditional backstage musical are all here: the tensions and camaraderie of the actors, the crises and glories of putting on a show. But there's so much more.</p>
        <p>In ''Topsy-Turvy'' both life and art are perilous: not just for Gilbert and Sullivan, but for the women who love them and the actors who work for them as well. The stage is a place of delicious illusion, a world of adults who never have to leave childhood pleasures behind. The world outside is marked by fears, frustrations and hard-won moments of satisfaction.</p>
        <p>''The Countess,'' by Gregory Murphy, reminds us of the terrifying imbalance of power between those who claim adult authority and those they treat like children. It has been playing off and off off Broadway for more than a year. It is a revisionist drama, since Ruskin's wife, Effie, was seen for years as one of those people who surround a genius and have no real needs, privileges or rights that he is bound to respect.</p>
        <p>Euphemia Gray was 13 when she first met John Ruskin. He was 22. Once they had married seven years later, he and his possessive, religious parents found her selfish, willful and mentally unbalanced, although to her friends and family she was clever, charming and much maligned. Then one of the young Pre-Raphaelite artists Ruskin championed, John Everett Millais, fell in love with Effie and after an awful battle of wills, she left Ruskin and sued for annulment. Ruskin said that he had married to have a worshipful companion, ''not for passion's sake.'' Effie said that he had finally confessed to feeling utter disgust on their wedding night because, apart from her beautiful face, she did not look like what he had dreamed a woman would be.</p>
        <p>The scene in which Effie confesses this to her friend Lady Eastlake is harrowing. She thinks she has a disease that cannot be named and she can barely get the words out. Mr. Murphy is not the first to show us these tormented private lives. Joan Abse explores much of this in her fine biography ''John Ruskin: The Passionate Moralist'' (Knopf). But Mr. Murphy centers on Effie, and gives a full-bodied portrait of a woman who was generally seen as too worldly and shallow for such a great man. Here she is restless, quick and at odds with herself, and very much our contemporary.</p>
        <p>As for Millais, it is easy to like a gifted man who assumes that you are as passionate and fully human as he. But ''The Countess'' does something harder. Mr. Murphy gives us a Ruskin whom we can pity as well as rage against for betraying the ideals he claimed to be teaching us. But the man who believed in justice for the working classes and admired the imperfect in architecture insisted that women be perfectly obedient, comforting and adoring. ''How could you!'' one still wants to shout, after all these years of psychoanalytic and feminist criticism. ''You were supposed to be better than that!''</p>
        <p>But he wasn't, and so in art as in life you take what you need, cast off what harms you and go your way rejoicing.</p>
