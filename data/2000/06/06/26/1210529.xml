        <p>When more than 700 people gathered to talk technology at a swanky bar here a few weeks ago, Ron May, this city's newest celebrity journalist, was standing by the exit, multi-tasking.</p>
        <p>''Hey, hey, hey. Give me your card!'' he demanded of a man who was trying to get by. Meanwhile, one eye was trained on some young Internet executive who was mouthing off into Mr. May's tape recorder about all the things he ought to be covering in his gossipy online newsletter, The May Report. Then he turned his tape recorder elsewhere, to another passer-by. ''Talk,'' he barked. ''Hey, talk!''</p>
        <p>With sweat beading up on his forehead, Mr. May then began prowling for more ''scoops,'' he said, all the while interrupting guests with his own running commentary on the local dot-com scene, berating members of a competing publication (which he said had tried to sabotage his local television appearance the night before), and all but harassing high-tech executives who tried to avoid him.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, when The May Report began, many of those executives could ignore him. But today, the cantankerous Mr. May is running, virtually by himself, one of the most influential high-tech publications in the Midwest. And along the way, he is raising some thorny questions about the future of online journalism.</p>
        <p>His newsletter, which is e-mailed to about 15,000 subscribers at no charge and posted on his Web site, www.themayreport.com, is an odd mixture of news, gossip, job listings and e-mail from readers, as well as awkward personal digressions and philosophical musings from the 44-year-old Mr. May, like: ''I'm going to crash the Blodgett talk. It helps to shower first.'' Or ''In our age of euphoria about making money, we, the commercial republic, appear to be forgetting the moral and ethical basis of our society.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, some executives say The May Report functions much like an Internet chat room. Last week, for instance, its lead story was based on an anonymous e-mail from someone saying that Beautyjungle.com was laying off some of its staff. (The company never announced layoffs.) Weeks earlier, Mr. May printed details about an executive's party habits.</p>
        <p>He has also printed internal memos, a ''Hot Babes'' list of Chicago's high-tech women, and he often writes as if penning a casual letter in which he mentions, for example, that a deal might be made and he's overheard the figure $54 million, but can't be sure.</p>
        <p>As a result, many Chicago executives complain that Mr. May is engaging in shoddy journalistic practices, using the Internet as a gossip mill, where theories, speculation and rumors can now be published and filtered into the mainstream media. His reports, after all, have already been cited by The Chicago Tribune, and Red Herring.</p>
        <p>''This is kind of the Matt Drudge effect,'' said Howard Tullman, the former chief executive at Tunes.com. Mr. Tullman, who led the online music news company before it was sold to EMusic last year, largely echoed the criticism leveled at Mr. Drudge and his news site, the Drudge Report. ''I don't think he checks anything. I think people have given him phony stories to see if he'll print anything, and apparently he will.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. May defends the newsletter, which he said expects to generate $600,000 in advertising revenue this year. ''I get typecast as a gossip columnist, but that's not what's going on here,'' he said in an interview. ''I see it as: here's what I know. And when I get it out there, more people come out of the woodwork.''</p>
        <p>A growing number of executives, venture capitalists and entrepreneurs are reading the newsletter, hoping to get what Mr. May promises is the ''inside story'' on the Chicago scene.</p>
        <p>''He's the town tattler of the high-tech community,'' said Robert Hendrickson, an investment banker in Chicago. ''Everyone badmouths The May Report, but everyone reads it.''</p>
        <p>In fact, the newsletter is already so powerful that several Chicago executives declined to speak for attribution, saying they feared Mr. May's journalistic wrath. And officials at Divine Interventures, one of the city's best-known Internet start-ups, admit privately that they are trying to stamp out Mr. May's voice by pressing their own staff and others in the high-tech community to boycott The May Report.</p>
        <p>Mr. May, however, says there's nothing inherently wrong with publishing rumors and gossip. The news kind of evolves anyway, he says, and once he prints something provocative, a flurry of e-mails might follow, shedding light on what is really happening. If journalism is the first draft of history, he suggests, rumor might serve as the first draft of journalism.</p>
        <p>''This is a fundamental shift in the way journalism has been done,'' said Mr. May, who also likes to use the newsletter to talk about his weight (280 pounds). ''The truth evolves out of the discussion I've created. This is where traditional journalists get flustered. You know Hegel? This is a kind of dialectic, a dialogue.''</p>
        <p>Many in the technology community, however, say it's not so much a dialectic as a reckless form of journalism.</p>
        <p>''The May Report serves a useful purpose in the Chicago high-tech community in getting the 'inside scoop' out as fast as possible,'' said Mohan Sawhney, a professor at Northwestern University and adviser to several local Internet start-ups. ''However, in his steadfast commitment to speed Ron May is given to shooting from the hip without verifying facts. It's a new style of journalism -- shoot first, think later.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. May's supporters insist he is filling an important niche in Chicago. He covers conferences, prints transcripts, job listings, news tidbits and, well, juicy gossip.</p>
        <p>''There's something more substantial than a big fat guy with an irreverent perspective,'' said Jeff Gilbert, the newsletter's humor columnist. ''At a newspaper, the fundamental person is the editor. What Ron has done is he's disintermediated, or eliminated, the editor. He says: 'Here's all I know. You determine what's important. You determine the facts.' And all the papers have discredited him for that.''</p>
        <p>One of Mr. May's sharpest critics is Darcy Evon, a columnist for The Chicago Sun-Times. She says The May Report is driven by rumor, not reporting, and that Mr. May is being manipulated by people using the shield of anonymity to attack upper management.</p>
        <p>''He's incapable of distinguishing fact from fiction,'' Ms. Evon said.</p>
        <p>The May Report has become a particularly hot topic of conversation these days largely because of a series of ''scoops'' that Mr. May says have upset the powers that be.</p>
        <p>On March 17, The May Report was the first to print that the new company formed by a merger of USWeb/CKS Group and Whittmann-Hart would be named March First, a report that some executives here say spoiled the company's surprise announcement.</p>
        <p>The May Report was also the first to report that Divine Interventures, the Internet incubator, was planning a major reorganization with as many as 300 layoffs.</p>
        <p>When Mr. May heard of the pending layoffs, he quickly e-mailed his readers, and then issued a news release through PR Newswire.</p>
        <p>The local papers picked up the story, but Divine said that only 29 employees had been let go, and that Mr. May's report was false.</p>
        <p>''It's all wild rumors and speculation,'' a Divine spokesman told The Chicago Tribune.</p>
        <p>Divine officials declined to comment for this article. But Mr. May has become such a thorn in the company's side that when the company held a meeting in Colorado earlier this year, a group of employees staged a satirical skit based on Mr. May.</p>
        <p>Mr. May has delighted in the notoriety. And he says other publications are trying to catch up with him. ''The only reason they're doing this now is because I proved there was a market for it,'' he said. ''I'm the one who tilled this soil.''</p>
        <p>The oldest son of a college marketing professor, Mr. May got into the business after a string of what he says were personal failures. He dropped out of the University of Chicago, worked as a recruiter for more than a decade, and wrote a freelance column in The Chicago Computer Guide. In 1996, however, he was hospitalized because of a diabetic condition that resulted in the loss of the bone in his left big toe. Depressed, out of work, and heavily in debt to a ''loan shark'' in his neighborhood, Mr. May says he began thinking about a career change.</p>
        <p>A family member eventually provided a $20,000 loan, and then Mr. May began writing again in 1997. He decided to focus his column on the emerging high-tech community in Chicago, but he says The Chicago Computer Guide rejected his new column.</p>
        <p>That's when Mr. May struck out on his own. ''I took the article and sent it out to 60 people on my e-mail list,'' he said. ''I woke up the next day and had 20 responses.''</p>
        <p>That was the birth of The May Report. Since then Mr. May has gathered material by, among other things, attending high-tech gatherings in Chicago. He usually shows up in a rumpled suit, carrying a tape recorder and a plastic bag, which he uses to collect business cards.</p>
        <p>At an interview in his Chicago apartment, which was so cluttered he could barely get the front door open, he walked through a pile of newspapers, plastic bags, books and boxes to grab a battered briefcase.</p>
        <p>''These are some of the cards I've collected,'' he said. Those cards became the foundation of his e-mail subscription list.</p>
        <p>That e-mail list has now exploded and Mr. May says he uses the e-mail forum to provide a valuable service to the community. For instance, after he wrote that US at Work laid off much of its staff, he published the e-mail addresses of people who lost their jobs.</p>
        <p>Mr. May, who reads with the aid of a magnifying glass, says he loves what he does. He often works deep into the night, preparing the column, which is published sporadically.</p>
        <p>''What he's done for the high-tech community in Chicago is amazing,'' said Jory Rozner, the 30-year-old founder of Zipple.com. ''He writes in a style that is so unique you want to read it. And I think it's funny it comes out at random times.''</p>
