      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial praises plan offered by Democratic Sen Bob Graham, covering insurance payments for drugs under Medicare, as better than Republican proposal, which would not serve elderly well; criticizes Democrats for not doing more to forge bipartisan support for legislation, which was quickly dismissed by Republicans; says bill could have been crucial middle ground between Republican proposals that rely almost entirely on private plans and some Democratic proposals that embrace little competition (M)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The House Ways and Means Committee passed legislation last week that promises to provide Medicare enrollees with coverage of prescription drugs. The promise might serve Republicans well as an election-year inoculation against Democratic sniping over lack of drug coverage. But the bill would not serve the elderly well. A better plan was offered later in the week by Democrats in the Senate. Their bill was swatted away by Republicans in part because it was sprung on them by surprise.</p>
        <p>Neither vote helped the elderly get what they need, adequate drug coverage. President Clinton tried to turn matters around Saturday, calling for coverage about twice as expensive as the plan he had previously proposed and the plan the House committee passed. Mr. Clinton's revised coverage mirrors that of the Democratic bill in the Senate.</p>

        <p>The House Ways and Means Committee passed legislation last week that promises to provide Medicare enrollees with coverage of prescription drugs. The promise might serve Republicans well as an election-year inoculation against Democratic sniping over lack of drug coverage. But the bill would not serve the elderly well. A better plan was offered later in the week by Democrats in the Senate. Their bill was swatted away by Republicans in part because it was sprung on them by surprise.</p>
        <p>Neither vote helped the elderly get what they need, adequate drug coverage. President Clinton tried to turn matters around Saturday, calling for coverage about twice as expensive as the plan he had previously proposed and the plan the House committee passed. Mr. Clinton's revised coverage mirrors that of the Democratic bill in the Senate.</p>
        <p>The House Republicans would have the government subsidize enrollees' purchases of coverage from private insurance companies. The typical policy would cover a substantial part of drug costs under $6,000 a year and all of the costs above that ceiling.</p>
        <p>There is nothing wrong with the bill's idea of unleashing competition to keep drug costs low. But health care markets must be carefully regulated to work. The House bill relies more on hope than rules.  It gives insurers leeway to design their benefit packages, an option that could allow plans to steer less healthy enrollees toward competitors. Some insurance companies threaten not to participate at all because they fear that only families that expect to run up large drug bills will decide to buy coverage. The Republicans say they can refute their critics, but the glaring fact is that the bill guarantees the elderly nothing but an undefined policy of uncertain cost.</p>
        <p>Senator Bob Graham, Democrat of Florida, offered a better idea. Under his plan, the government would provide the insurance -- as President Clinton proposes -- and guarantee that no enrollee would pay more than $4,000 a year for drugs. It is this cap that President Clinton embraced over the weekend. The bill would turn over the task of administering drug coverage to private benefit managers, who would compete to attract enrollees by offering better service and cutting costs --  perhaps by encouraging enrollees to use generic drugs. Competition among managers could also allay Republican fears that government insurance would bring price controls.</p>
        <p>Mr. Graham and the Democratic co-sponsors did little to forge bipartisan support. That was an unfortunate decision because the central features of the bill could provide an attractive middle ground between Republican bills that rely entirely on private plans and some Democratic proposals, including the president's, that embrace little competition.  That is regrettable news for the third of the elderly who lack private drug coverage.</p>
