        <p>A clerical court closed another of Iran's dwindling stock of liberal newspapers today in a new challenge to the reformers who have promised to use their dominance in Parliament to repeal restrictive press laws.</p>
        <p>The newspaper, Bayan, was run by a left-wing cleric whose last editorial denounced the judiciary. Its closing coincided with a surge of parliamentary criticism of the courts, accusing them of being political and not accountable to the public.</p>
        <p>Two months ago, in a period of two weeks, conservative judges in Tehran shut 19 newspapers and magazines associated with the reform movement, accusing them of threatening Islamic values.</p>
        <p>Among them was the newspaper owned by one of the new members of Parliament, Mohammad Reza Khatami, who is the brother of President Mohammad Khatami, the moderate cleric whose landslide victory three years ago inspired an explosion of feisty independent publications.</p>
        <p>Supporters of President Khatami won two-thirds of the seats in the new Parliament, which opened at the end of May, and they have already made their agenda clear. Just last week, 151 members signed a sharply worded letter calling on the leader of the judiciary to stop ''the illegal and politically motivated closure of newspapers.'' The actions of the courts, the letter added, damaged the country's image abroad.</p>
        <p>Parliament has also voted to give top priority to a new press law that would prohibit closing a newspaper without a hearing and trying journalists without a jury. In its crackdown on the press, the conservative judiciary has summarily closed papers and sent writers to prison after non-jury hearings. Five pro-Khatami journalists are in jail.</p>
        <p>The press bill has not yet been presented, but some of its drafters have said they want to prevent the Special Court for Clergy and the Revolutionary Court, the most conservative branches of Iran's multilayered judicial system, from judging press cases.</p>
        <p>Bayan was closed by the clerical court, which has already jailed some of the country's most prominent reformist clerics. The newspaper, which has been publishing for less than a year, is owned by Ali-Akbar Mohtashamipour, a cleric who is also a candidate for one of two Tehran parliamentary seats that have yet to be decided. His signed editorial today attacked the court system.</p>
        <p>After the closing of most reform papers in April, Khatami supporters pleaded for calm and urged against demonstrations for press freedom, saying they could jeopardize the opening of the new Parliament.</p>
        <p>''At that time, we were frightened the hard-liners would not permit reformers to open the new Parliament,'' said Hamid Reza Jalaipur, the editor of one of the main reformist dailies closed in April.</p>
        <p>''Before the new Parliament, the challenge was between the press and the hard-liners through the judicial system,'' he added. ''These days the battle has changed to the Parliament against the judiciary.''</p>
        <p>The latest crackdown did not seem to faze Mr. Jalaipur, who has opened six newspapers that have been shut down by the courts during the last three years. He and his staff started yet another one on Saturday.</p>
        <p>''I am still very optimistic,'' he said. ''Civil rights are not given. We have to go and get them.''</p>
