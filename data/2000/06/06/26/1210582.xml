        <p>After a 38-second demolition of Lou Savarese on Saturday night, Mike Tyson once again has the gate appeal that is the linchpin to earning a heavyweight title shot. Punching power is the biggest attraction in boxing, and Tyson dominated in what was essentially a one-punch fight.</p>
        <p>It is everything else Tyson did Saturday that will cast doubt on his competence and his discipline to mount a serious pursuit of the title. With every fight, Tyson appears a little more out of control.</p>
        <p>His roughhousing of Referee John Coyle on Saturday was Tyson's latest blatant disregard of ring rules, and even if it is an offense he will sidestep, the mounting transgressions will eventually complicate Tyson's attempts to be licensed to fight again.</p>
        <p>When Coyle tried to stop the fight, Tyson ignored the referee's orders to stop punching. With Coyle between the fighters, Tyson slugged away at Savarese.</p>
        <p>It was not a momentary lapse or a brief episode of overaggressiveness. With Coyle shouting at him, Tyson jumped around the referee and threw a left hook that glanced off Coyle and knocked him down.</p>
        <p>Coyle might have disqualified Tyson, the former undisputed heavyweight champion, had he not decided to stop the fight.</p>
        <p>''As soon as Mike hit Lou a second time, I shouted, 'Stop!' and dived in,'' said Coyle, who was not hurt in the exchange. ''Mike said he couldn't hear me even though I was standing right in front of him. And I don't know how he didn't see me.''</p>
        <p>Asked why he did not penalize Tyson, Coyle said: ''As soon as I shouted, 'Stop boxing!' the contest is over. Whatever happens after that, the contest is finished at that point.''</p>
        <p>But others watching the fight were outraged, especially many Britons who had hardly welcomed Tyson.</p>
        <p>''Boxing is a sport; he is a devil,'' said the former world champion Barry McGuigan of Northern Ireland, who was a commentator for the British broadcast of the fight. ''To push a referee out of the way to get past him and inflict further pain on an already defeated opponent is disgraceful.''</p>
        <p>After the fight, Tyson, whose purse for the bout was $8 million, also acknowledged that he had not trained much to prepare for Savarese.</p>
        <p>''Maybe two weeks at the most,'' Tyson said. And he basically took the week off before the fight.</p>
        <p>Still, Tyson said he wanted to fight the recognized heavyweight champion, Lennox Lewis, even as he conceded he was not in good enough shape to take him on. That did not stop Tyson from unleashing a grotesque harangue aimed at Lewis.</p>
        <p>''I want your heart; I want to eat your children,'' Tyson said. ''Praise be to Allah.''</p>
        <p>In the ring just after the fight ended, Tyson was a bizarre sight even by boxing's standards. He was angry and agitated, his eyes wild as they darted around Hampden Park, the 51,000-seat soccer stadium where just 20,000 showed for the fight.</p>
        <p>''I'm the best, the most brutal, vicious and ruthless champion there's ever been,'' Tyson said. ''There's no one who can stop me.''</p>
        <p>But a fight with Lewis is not likely. Lewis is linked contractually with Home Box Office, while Tyson has a similar agreement with Showtime.</p>
        <p>Jay Larkin, the Showtime senior vice president, called on fight fans to ''write HBO and ask them to free Lennox Lewis.'' But there are more realistic possibilities. And as uncivil as Tyson may be getting in the ring, there will be somebody somewhere willing to stage his next fight.</p>
        <p>The World Boxing Association heavyweight title, for example, is vacant, at least until Evander Holyfield and John Ruiz fight in August. Tyson could be matched with the winner of that fight, probably setting up Tyson-Holyfield III.</p>
        <p>One thing seems nearly certain: Tyson will not be invited back to Britain. Not only were women's groups angry about his presence because of his rape conviction and his history of violence against women, but fight fans here were put through two farcical one-round fights. They thought Tyson's first-round knockout of Julius Francis in January was unfulfilling. Then came 38 seconds in the dank Glasgow rain late Saturday night.</p>
        <p>''People keep waiting for some Mike Tyson of years ago,'' Lewis's manager, Frank Maloney, said of Tyson. ''But that's not going to happen. He's a carnival act now. That's all he is.''</p>
