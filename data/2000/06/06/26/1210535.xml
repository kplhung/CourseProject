      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>By the third request to her band to lower its volume, Aretha Franklin wasn't kidding around. She fixed her eyes on her band leader and got an ovation from the crowd when she asked him, specifically, to fix the problem. But the evening had already lost so much momentum that there was virtually no way Saturday night's concert at Avery Fisher Hall, part of the JVC Jazz Festival, was going to end up very satisfying.</p>
        <p>The last JVC show she played in town, three years ago, was filled with speeches by religious and political leaders. This time there was the gratuitous introductory set from her band (a medley of summer-theme pop songs) and several periods when she left the stage entirely. She had enthusiasm, and a few moments at which she astonished the crowd with the sheer power of her voice. But nothing was sustained, and the concert was a frustration.</p>

        <p>By the third request to her band to lower its volume, Aretha Franklin wasn't kidding around. She fixed her eyes on her band leader and got an ovation from the crowd when she asked him, specifically, to fix the problem. But the evening had already lost so much momentum that there was virtually no way Saturday night's concert at Avery Fisher Hall, part of the JVC Jazz Festival, was going to end up very satisfying.</p>
        <p>The last JVC show she played in town, three years ago, was filled with speeches by religious and political leaders. This time there was the gratuitous introductory set from her band (a medley of summer-theme pop songs) and several periods when she left the stage entirely. She had enthusiasm, and a few moments at which she astonished the crowd with the sheer power of her voice. But nothing was sustained, and the concert was a frustration.</p>
        <p>Ms. Franklin stood in front of a titanic band. There was a 10-piece pickup horn section (which she kept referring to respectfully as ''the New York musicians,'' calling them priceless, then joking about how pricey they actually were); a drummer and two percussionists (including everything from tinkly chimes to kettledrums); organ and piano; electric bass and guitar; and four backup singers. As opposed to her gospel show during the 1997 festival, this concert stuck mostly to her pop material, from the 60's to the present. She began with her recent hit ''Jump to It,'' and immediately her problems began. She could scarcely be heard, or hear herself, in the thicket of treble coming from booming funk drums, tambourines and shakers; feedback came from the speakers even when the band stopped playing. After a few recent songs, she went back to the 60's: ''Think,'' ''Respect'' and ''Ain't No Way,'' beginning a transition into the rapid call-and-response gospel style. During ''Respect,'' she walked off midsong, letting the band carry chorus after chorus by itself for five minutes.</p>
        <p>Sitting down to the piano, she dedicated Leon Russell's ''A Song for You'' to the soul singer Johnnie Taylor, and got out of it the first strong performance of the night; riding that surge, she began ''A Rose Is Still a Rose,'' from her last record, with jazz-vocal scatting.</p>
        <p>Then it was time to reprise her 1998 Grammy Awards show coup with her version of ''Nessun Dorma,'' the Puccini aria, with a synthesized orchestral backing. The piece is essentially a short, slow-moving, constant crescendo, mixing the vocal languages of opera and gospel, and her full, perfectly pitched voice could have stopped a tank.</p>
        <p>In the final 15 minutes, milking a gospel song, she thanked her couturier, hairdresser, a number of agents, and a few celebrities in the crowd; her encore, after changing clothes, was basically a walk-on for an incredible coat whose high neo-Elizabethan collar fanned out above her head.</p>
        <p>The night had given Ms. Franklin trouble in asserting her nobility; the coat shored it up for her.</p>
