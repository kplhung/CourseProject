        <p>HAYES-Mickey, died June 14 in Beverly Hills, California. He was eighty-seven. Hayes was a Miami Beach resident for more than fifty years. Born in New York, he began his career as a window dresser for men's shops. He moved to Miami Beach in 1945 and opened a men's clothing store on Lincoln Road. A year later, he moved to Roney Plaza Hotel where he became a fixture for over twenty years, known as the store ''where the stars shop''. Celebrities on the Miami Beach nightclub circuit touted his wares. Pictures throughout the store featured Hayes's famous friends: Sinatra, Don Rickles, Lucille Ball, etc. In 1957 an advertisement in The Miami Herald listed one hundred three stars who patronized his shop including Tony Bennett, Milton Berle, Red Buttons, Jan Murray, Sid Caesar, Jimmy Durante and Liberace. In 1966 the store moved to 23rd and Collins, with Buddy Hackett and Alan King cutting the opening ribbon. He remained there until 1985 when at seventy-two he retired, planning to live half of each year in Beverly Hills and half in Miami Beach. Mickey has contributed a significant portion of his estate to South Florida Charities. Anyone wishing to make a charitable contribution in Mickey's honor should contact Danny Welkes at 310657-5000.</p>
