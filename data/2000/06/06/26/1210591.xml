        <p>Paul O'Neill waved futilely at an outside pitch by Mike Sirotka, as if he needed a bat as long as a vaulting pole to make contact. After O'Neill missed the breaking pitch and struck out in the fourth inning this afternoon, his frustration immediately appeared, and it reflected the feelings of an exasperated team.</p>
        <p>O'Neill flicked his left hand toward the plate umpire, Terry Craft, to indicate his disdain for an earlier strike call, flipped his bat to the ground and then spiked his helmet off the grass.</p>
        <p>When O'Neill reached the first-base dugout, he turned, saw Craft staring at him and asked, ''What are you looking at?''</p>
        <p>That was when Craft ejected O'Neill.</p>
        <p>Arms pumping, shoulders hunched and the veins in his neck bulging, O'Neill sprinted out of the dugout and got within a few inches of Craft. O'Neill lifted his arms in protest, leaned in to Craft's face and explained that he had not cursed at the umpire. But it did not matter. O'Neill was gone and the Yankees followed him into submission after their six-run ninth inning came up short and they tumbled to the Chicago White Sox, 8-7, at Comiskey Park.</p>
        <p>The Yankees (37-33) should be concerned about the White Sox (48-27), who have stifled them six times in seven games during an 11-day span. The Yankees should also be worried about a season that is deteriorating.</p>
        <p>Third baseman Scott Brosius injured his right hamstring in the fifth inning and could be placed on the disabled list, further impairing a team that is already missing two starting pitchers and is gasping for excuses as the speculation about a trade for Juan Gonzalez or Sammy Sosa covers them like perspiration.</p>
        <p>''Sure, I'd like it to go away,'' Manager Joe Torre said. ''It hovers over you. When you struggle a little bit, you tend to let things bother you. You can't do that. You wish that it would go away or they would so something so the cloud would go away.''</p>
        <p>After finishing a revealing stretch against teams with winning records by going an unimpressive 9-12, and after losing four of five since defeating Pedro Martinez and the Boston Red Sox last Tuesday, the Yankees are evolving into an ornery bunch.</p>
        <p>Torre has been weary of any trade questions for several days and felt reporters overstated the seriousness of pitcher Ramiro Mendoza's right shoulder injury. O'Neill and Brosius, who were important elements in today's game, left the clubhouse without talking to members of the news media. Shortstop Derek Jeter repeatedly and sharply advised reporters to stop asking outfielder Ricky Ledee about the possibility of being traded and scoffed at the notion that the Yankees might actually need a change.</p>
        <p>''You don't sit around waiting for something to happen,'' Jeter said. ''We got 25 guys here. We're capable of winning with these 25 guys here. That's how you have to look at it.''</p>
        <p>Ledee has been more affected by the trade speculation than any other Yankee because he was part of the conditional trade to Detroit for Gonzalez. The soft-spoken Ledee added some drama to today's game when he drilled a three-run homer in the ninth that helped the Yankees climb within one run. It might have been a symbolic hit for Ledee, who has one foot in the Yankees' clubhouse and one foot out.</p>
        <p>''I just don't think about it,'' Ledee said. ''I'm still here. I'm not in Detroit. I'm part of the Yankees. I'm still wearing this uniform.''</p>
        <p>Andy Pettitte (7-4) can identify with Ledee's situation because he was almost traded last year and it nearly unraveled him. Pettitte felt great today, but he complimented the White Sox for being aggressive whenever he made mistakes while racing to a 4-0 lead after three innings and a 6-1 lead after six.</p>
        <p>The score was 8-1 when the Yankees exploded for six runs in the ninth before Bob Howry struck out Jose Vizcaino to end the game.</p>
        <p>When he was asked if the Yankees were confused, Pettitte nodded.</p>
        <p>''We're in unfamiliar territory,'' he said. ''Over the last four years, we're used to being the team that comes in and takes the series. We're still a team. We're just not playing with the confidence we should be playing with. We got to remember we're the world champions, not the other guys across the field.''</p>
        <p>But the White Sox looked and played like the superior team today because they were. The Yankees are frustrated and they are searching, trying to remember what it was like when they were the best team in the major leagues. They had a lot of time to ponder their troubles; their charter plane was delayed for three hours. ''I'd like to believe that we will have fun before this thing is over,'' Torre said. ''Right now, it's not a lot of fun.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>After RAMIRO MENDOZA told reporters ''I'm scared'' because of continuing stiffness in his shoulder, the Yankees were worried. General Manager BRIAN CASHMAN called the trainers on Sunday because Mendoza's explanation of the injury to reporters was more dire than it had been to the Yankees. ''It's obviously something we have to monitor, but right now it's not a major concern,'' said Cashman, who is convinced that Mendoza has muscle fatigue that may stem from this being his first full season as a starter. Mendoza, who is expected to start on Thursday against the Tigers, said: ''I feel better. I'm going to see what happens in a couple of days.'' The Yankees are shopping for a pitcher, so they obviously would not want other teams to think Mendoza was hurting. That could have an adverse impact on potential trade talks.</p>
