        <p>After dinner was served to the elite group of computer scientists assembled at Boston's sumptuous Bay Tower Room last Tuesday night, Prof. Juhani Kuusi, chief of the Nokia Research Center in Finland, made a toast.</p>
        <p>''We have taken on a great challenge,'' Professor Kuusi said in his lilting accent. ''Let's do it.''</p>
        <p>The challenge Professor Kuusi referred to was Oxygen, a five-year project headed by Michael Dertouzos, the director of the Laboratory for Computer Science at M.I.T. The dinner was the first meeting of Oxygen's corporate underwriters.</p>
        <p>At $1 million a year for five years, the price of admission to Oxygen is unusually high, particularly because M.I.T.'s computer laboratory and its sister Artificial Intelligence Laboratory have long relied almost exclusively on government financing. Those ponying up are the Acer Group, Delta Electronics, Hewlett-Packard, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, Nokia and Royal Philips Electronics. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency will supply an additional $20 million.</p>
        <p>Although the Oxygen software itself will be in the public domain, each company hopes to get something different from the deal. Several officials said they were particularly interested in M.I.T.'s work on computers that respond to human speech. All intend to work closely with M.I.T.'s researchers, and under the deal, will own the intellectual property rights to anything they invent.</p>
        <p>While few would articulate it, beyond a general support for ''open systems,'' one other principle seemed to unite the Oxygen alliance.</p>
        <p>'' Microsoft is too strong,'' said Kenichiro Ishii, deputy director of N.T.T.'s Communication Science Laboratories in Kyoto, Japan. ''So if the Oxygen project is a strong competitor to Microsoft, it's exciting to us.''</p>
