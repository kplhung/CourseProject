        <p>Judith Hergovich had only the vaguest expectations of what lay ahead when she left her tiny village of Trausdorf, Austria, in August 1998 to spend a year teaching math in New York City.</p>
        <p>''I knew it would be hard,'' said Ms. Hergovich, who was 25 at the time and had been teaching only a year. ''I knew the students are a little bit tougher than in Austria.''</p>
        <p>What she did not know was that her new workplace, Adlai E. Stevenson High School in the southeast Bronx, had 3,500 students -- more than twice the population of Trausdorf -- some of the most crowded, chaotic classrooms in the city, and one of its highest dropout rates.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Hergovich plowed right in, teaching five classes a day and soaking up life in New York -- which in her case meant an austere apartment in the Pelham Parkway section of the Bronx, far from the skyscrapers she knew from movies and postcards. Despite the unnerving challenges she faced, she found the experience rewarding enough to stay for a second school year.</p>
        <p>Like Tocqueville touring America in the 19th century, Ms. Hergovich and the 45 other Austrians recruited to help ease a shortage of math and science teachers have observed life here from an outsider's vantage point, and they are bubbling with insights about New York City's education culture. Almost all have struggled with more serious discipline problems than they expected, and with the quandary of how to teach students whose abysmal grades would relegate them to trade school in Austria.</p>
        <p>''I have to be more strict and more mean here,'' said Eva Kailbauer, 28, who is teaching math at Franklin Delano Roosevelt High School in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. ''In Austria, if a kid says they have to go to the nurse, they really have to. Here, kids take every opportunity to really test you. I trusted them at first.''</p>
        <p>But the Austrian teachers have also been moved by the hardships that many teenagers here face. ''It's always your worst students who have the biggest problems at home,'' said Lutz Holzinger, 30, a biology teacher at Roosevelt who has signed up for a third year here. ''One bad student who acts up all the time, I learn his mother has AIDS and there is no father. I would freak out, too.''</p>
        <p>At the same time, Mr. Holzinger and several others say they cannot believe what they see as stubborn indifference among many city students and the enormous tolerance of failure.</p>
        <p>''It's very frustrating that many students give up before they enter the classroom,'' said Ms. Hergovich, who was transferred from Stevenson to DeWitt Clinton High School, also in the Bronx, this year. ''I never saw something like this in Austria. I don't know who to blame here; I wouldn't say American culture. Just maybe the circumstances of how they were raised and where they live.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Kailbauer and Mr. Holzinger said that to their surprise, other teachers had told them not to blame themselves when many of their students failed standardized tests.</p>
        <p>''In the beginning I was shocked because 50 percent failed the tests,'' Mr. Holzinger said. ''But then I found out this is normal. Chemistry, math, all classes. If 50 percent pass, it's O.K.''</p>
        <p>Thomas Lepuschitz, 30, a math teacher at Roosevelt, said he did not understand why New York State required even the poorest students to take math and science to graduate. In Austria, he said, students who do not excel academically are sent to trade school, which he said was a more sensible route.</p>
        <p>''Our school system divides people who can do certain things and people who can't,'' Mr. Lepuschitz said. ''The people who can't are not lost; it's just a slower track.''</p>
        <p>The Board of Education began recruiting in Austria in 1998, after Alfred Posamentier, a professor of mathematics education at City College, pointed out that Austria had a surplus of math and science teachers, many with advanced degrees. The Austrian government was enthusiastic because the teachers would come back fluent in English, an increasingly sought-after credential.</p>
        <p>''I immediately wanted to go for it,'' recalled Mr. Holzinger, who heard about the opportunity from a radio advertisement. ''I already was planning to go to New York, and this was a chance to do reasonable work instead of being a waiter or something like that.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lepuschitz applied for a job here in 1998 because he was 40th on a waiting list for a teaching job in Austria. He had spent eight months student-teaching in a private school. His first assignment, at Walton High School in the Bronx, was terrifying, he said.</p>
        <p>''Students threatened me,'' said Mr. Lepuschitz, looking studious and very young in jeans and a baggy sweater. ''They didn't behave.''</p>
        <p>He requested and was granted a transfer to Roosevelt High School last fall, after hearing from other Austrians that students were better behaved there. But Roosevelt students tried his patience, too, he said.</p>
        <p>''They don't know how to solve an equation after you tell them three times,'' Mr. Lepuschitz said. ''Out of 30 students, maybe 10 will answer the question, three plus seven equals X, what is X? And that is a simple problem!''</p>
        <p>Mr. Holzinger, for one, seems to have mastered the discipline problem by acting hip and unflappable. One rainy spring morning, his students -- even the one whose T-shirt read, ''Rule by Intimidation'' -- listened quietly as he explained the difference between DNA and RNA. Ms. Kailbauer's approach was similarly no-nonsense. After passing out work sheets to her ninth-grade algebra class, she sat ramrod straight at her desk, surveying them with a glare.</p>
        <p>''Those of you who are not sure what to do,'' she said gruffly, ''just listen.''</p>
        <p>Almost all the Austrians say their personal lives in New York City have been far less taxing than their professional ones. Many share apartments with one or two other Austrians, typically in far-flung neighborhoods in Brooklyn and the Bronx, furnished with thrift-shop finds. They tend to stick together, venturing into Manhattan on weekends to see movies and visit museums.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kailbauer spends her free time playing league volleyball and basketball. Martin Zeindl, who teaches math and physics at the Academy of American Studies in Queens, has found a social network through his church.</p>
        <p>Assigned to high schools in every borough but Staten Island, the Austrian teachers have generally won praise for knowing their material and speaking solid English. Adele Vocel, the principal at Roosevelt, said the Austrian teachers fit right in at her school because the teaching staff and the student body were already so diverse. The students speak 32 languages, and many of the teachers have thicker accents than the Austrians.</p>
        <p>''When I heard there was a new wave and I saw we had the ability to absorb some of them, I begged,'' said Ms. Vocel, who hired four Austrians last year and four this year. ''These teachers are very well prepared, and they work very hard.''</p>
        <p>But Sandra Abrams, the principal of James Madison High School in Brooklyn, said that although the Austrian teachers know their subjects thoroughly, she had reservations about their ''chalk-and-talk'' style of teaching.</p>
        <p>''They tend to have a lecture-style approach,'' said Dr. Abrams, whose school had two Austrian teachers last year but none this year. ''We like to see students involved in a very hands-on kind of way rather than being passive and taking notes.''</p>
        <p>Officials at the United Federation of Teachers said that they had no complaints about the Austrian teachers, who are paid according to the union-negotiated salary scale. Those with master's degrees earned about $36,000 this year, slightly more than they would make as teachers in Austria, they said.</p>
        <p>Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy said in an interview that he was interested in expanding the program and perhaps starting others modeled on it. The number of teachers from Austria and other countries may more than triple next year if 100 new candidates pass muster. Board officials are interviewing them this week in Vienna and Innsbruck, Austria.</p>
        <p>The applicant pool has grown because the Austrian-American Educational Cooperation Association, which administers the program in Vienna, hired a full-time recruiter last fall and stepped up television advertising. The new round of applicants, some of whom were drawn by the ads and some by word of mouth, includes several teachers from the Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy and Sweden.</p>
        <p>New York City needs math and science teachers more than ever; board officials anticipate needing to hire nearly 700 new math teachers for the coming school year. Howard S. Tames, executive director of the board's personnel division, said that most of the 400 math teachers the board hired this year were not certified in math. He said the board would also try to recruit qualified teachers from Canada, the Caribbean and perhaps India and the Philippines over the next few years.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Levy warned that such programs were not ideal because the teachers were here only temporarily.</p>
        <p>''This is a good thing in situations where we're really hard up,'' he said. ''But in the end, we'd rather have permanent teachers who come here to stay.''</p>
        <p>Unlike the Austrian teachers in the first round, of whom all but six went home after the 1998-99 school year, 20 of the current 29 teachers have signed on for another year. Last week, at a party in their honor at the Austrian Consulate, several said their students had done surprisingly well on the state Regents exams. Even Mr. Lepuschitz, who had complained about disruptive students in an earlier interview, said the final weeks of school had been unexpectedly pleasant.</p>
        <p>''The troublemakers didn't come to class anymore as soon as the weather got warm,'' he said with a shrug. ''The people who wanted to learn could finally learn.''</p>
