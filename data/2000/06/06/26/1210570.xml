        <p>Alex Corretja and Albert Costa expressed their dismay with the preferential treatment given to grass-court players under the seeding system at Wimbledon by withdrawing from the tournament in protest on the eve of the event's first round of play.</p>
        <p>Two hours before their decision tonight, sitting at a news conference next to tennis officials, Corretja threatened to play one game in his first match and walk off the court, which would create an embarrassment for the All England Club. Corretja, Costa and another Spaniard, Juan Carlos Ferrero, said they were fed up with what they called an injustice and a lack of respect for the rankings. All three are ranked among the top 16 players on the ATP Tour but were not seeded.</p>
        <p>''We are not terrorists,'' Corretja said.</p>
        <p>Although the All England Club has traditionally ignored the player rankings when issuing seedings, this year the consequences could be greater for an unseeded player with a tough draw. Now, the ATP requires players to play in mandatory events, including nine in the Masters Series and the four Grand Slams. Until this season, only a player's best 14 tournaments counted toward his ranking.</p>
        <p>''Before when we played here, we could say, 'No, I don't like to go to Wimbledon because they don't respect my ranking; they have their own rules,' '' Corretja said. ''We respect that, and I stay home. Right now, we have to play here, but still they don't respect our ranking. So if we have one ranking, we should respect that.''</p>
        <p>Before withdrawing, the Spaniards sent a proposal to Mark Miles, the chief executive of the ATP Tour, requesting that the tournament be redrawn or the players be allowed to drop the tournament from the mandatory events. Miles and the chairman of the All England Club, Tim Phillips, said they were sympathetic to the position represented by Corretja -- and vowed to work out a fairer system for next year -- but said they could not make changes for this year's Wimbledon.</p>
        <p>''Our sort of philosophical problem with going straight down the ATP rankings is that you can have situations which then crop up which don't really suit the tournament,'' Phillips said.</p>
        <p>Ferrero, who withdrew on Saturday because of a back injury, was replaced in the draw by Wayne Black of Zimbabwe. The exit of Costa and Corretja will allow two more losers from the qualifying competition to play in the draw. The Australian Werner Eschauer will take Corretja's position, while the German Michael Kohlmann will replace Costa.</p>
