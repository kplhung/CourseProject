        <p>A rare corner in the life of Abraham Lincoln largely unplumbed by scholars -- the country cottage that he loved to commute to in three-mile horseback rides from the White House -- is about to be designated by preservationists as the most endangered historic site in the nation.</p>
        <p>The retreat, known as Anderson Cottage, where the president spent almost a quarter of his incumbency and wrote a draft of the Emancipation Proclamation, will head the annual endangered list this week from the National Trust for Historic Preservation, the nonprofit group that searches out rare buildings and neighborhoods across the country.</p>
        <p>''This is the most important 'unknown' presidential site in America,'' the president of the trust, Richard Moe, said of the neo-Gothic, gingerbread-trimmed cottage, now office space in a veterans' retirement home, where Lincoln sought surcease from the Civil War.</p>
        <p>In using this hideaway, the great emancipator became the great commuter. From 1862 to 1864, from June to early November, Lincoln used the cottage as a pastoral, workaday sanctuary from the swampy downtown of the capital. He preferred commuting daily by horseback, often at night and often without guards until a would-be assassin shot off his stovepipe hat in August 1864 and sent him galloping for safety to the cottage down the Seventh Street Pike. The hat was retrieved with a bullet hole in it.</p>
        <p>The Camp David of the 19th century, the 14-room hilltop structure stands on the spacious grounds of the U.S. Soldiers' and Airmen's Home in northwest Washington. The cottage, while structurally sound, has basement seepage, rotting casements, leaking radiators and antiquated wiring, and is in danger of slipping further into the fringe of history, Mr. Moe said.</p>
        <p>''It's probably the country's most significant Lincoln site because it is the only one associated with his presidency, and it's the only major Lincoln site that has not been restored,'' he said, calling for renovation of the time-worn cottage to the state enjoyed by Lincoln and his family.</p>
        <p>Michael Beschloss, presidential historian, said, ''It's remarkably intact.''</p>
        <p>''We all venerate Lincoln, but right there was the banister Lincoln gripped and the fireplace that warmed him,'' said Mr. Beschloss, who visited the cottage last week in researching a book on the Lincoln assassination.</p>
        <p>He suggested that the cottage could fill a void in the capital, which has no museum dedicated to Lincoln.</p>
        <p>Walt Whitman, ever the Lincoln eyewitness, described Lincoln ''coming to business'' one morning at 8:30, riding tall down Vermont Avenue to the White House: ''Mr. Lincoln on the saddle generally rides a good-sized, easy-going grey horse, is dressed in plain black, somewhat rusty and dusty, wears a black stiff hat, and looks about as ordinary in attire, etc., as the commonest man.''</p>
        <p>The Lincolns began using the cottage in their second summer in Washington, in 1862, four months after the death of their young son, Willie. The serenity of the woodsy grounds and breezy porch is still palpable despite the urban encroachment of 20th-century brick housing beyond the tree-lined grounds.</p>
        <p>The president walked the land and, according to one record, would ''talk all night'' with war strategists summoned from downtown. One visitor told of Lincoln producing a map to gravely show the day's shifting news of the war, but then taking up a book of verse to find relief of some humorous stanzas.</p>
        <p>Near the cottage, he could climb a tower used by military semaphore signalers and enjoy a bird's-eye view of the city he regularly escaped, with the unfinished Washington Monument and the Capitol on the southern horizon.</p>
        <p>''There were trees -- oak, chestnut and beech -- maple, cypress and cedar -- and they gave rest and companionship,'' Carl Sandburg wrote in his Lincoln biography. The president gravitated to a copper beech tree, now 300 years old, near the cottage.</p>
        <p>''Lincoln would bring a chair out here and think,'' said Mr. Moe, who was standing in the hushed vaultlike space created by the tree's grand horizontal limbs touching the ground. ''He'd climb this tree with Tad.''</p>
        <p>As reports of assassination plots grew more frequent, Lincoln was pressed to abandon the solitude of his fond trek, aboard a horse he named ''Old Abe,'' and submit to escort by cavalry soldiers. Sometimes he made the trip by carriage with his wife, Mary, but complained they could not hear each other talk for the ''jingling of spurs and the jangling of sabers.'' Other times he rode off alone without the cavalry, alarming aides who had been warned of a plot to kidnap Lincoln from the summer house.</p>
        <p>The stucco-trimmed cottage, named in honor of Maj. Robert Anderson, the officer who commanded Fort Sumter when the Confederacy rebelled, stands handsomely on the 320-acre haven, where 1,100 veterans live in a series of buildings, pursuing retirement and, for some, precious details of Lincoln's cottage days.</p>
        <p>''I'm really living history here,'' said Ray L. Colvard, an 82-year-old former high school history teacher and 20-year Navy veteran who lives on the grounds. He is a resident Lincoln fanatic, underlining each rare reference he can find to the cottage.</p>
        <p>''You very much sense Lincoln here,'' said Mr. Colvard, standing respectfully in the president's second-floor bedroom, now a conference room in the 158-year-old house that was built as an exurban retreat by George W. Riggs Jr., a prominent banker.</p>
        <p>Before the war, Gen. Winfield Scott, concerned about neglected veterans, used $100,000 in booty from the war with Mexico to finance the soldiers' home and buy the cottage. Its champion in the Senate was Jefferson Davis, later the Confederate president. Five other presidents used the cottage, but none as much as Lincoln.</p>
        <p>''I can almost feel the anguish of that time as Lincoln waited here for some success in the war,'' said Mr. Colvin, treating the simple bedroom as an overlooked shrine. It is where Lincoln, in 1862, wrote the second draft of the edict that would free the slaves. He had hoped to time it for some hopeful turning in the war because emancipation was a controversial initiative that cabinet members were advising against.</p>
        <p>''Things looked darker than ever,'' Lincoln told a friend, the painter Francis B. Carpenter. The debacle of the second Battle of Bull Run forced him to put aside the proclamation. ''Finally came the week of the Battle of Antietam,'' Lincoln said of a clash that Northerners claimed as a victory. ''I determined to wait no longer.''</p>
        <p>There are few visitors each year to the cottage, which Mr. Moe noted had been kept structurally sound by the administrators of the retirement home.</p>
        <p>But fresh research and a complete interior repair are needed, he said, to turn back the deterioration in the basement and attic, remove office dividers and recast the cottage to the time and furnishings of Lincoln.</p>
        <p>''I can't get over it,'' Mr. Moe said, savoring the sanctuary. ''Lincoln's the most written-about person in American history, and yet there's virtually nothing on this place,'' he said, envisioning it as a Lincoln research and education center.</p>
        <p>The cottage was no escape from the war. The Battle of Fort Stephens raged two miles to the north and Lincoln rode up to view it,  said Mr. Moe, who has written a book on the Civil War. When Gen. Jubal Early was on the outskirts of Washington in his bold raid on Union troops in July 1864, his troops headed near enough to the cottage for Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton to demand that Lincoln return to the White House. On one ride, if he needed a fresh reminder, Lincoln encountered an ambulance train.</p>
        <p>Lincoln made his final visit, a happy, one-day jaunt to the cottage, on April 13, 1865, the day before he was assassinated. Mr. Beschloss noted this was at last a time of rising optimism for the president and of fresh springtime as he checked that his retreat was ready for the summer.</p>
        <p>''The war was ending,'' Mr. Beschloss said. ''And he and Mary were looking for a more peaceful and happier life.''</p>
