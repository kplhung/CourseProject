        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Thank you for Joe Sharkey's column (Business Travel, June 21) about public cell phone use. At least, thus far, airplane passengers are subjected to this particular form of rudeness only while the plane is waiting to leave.</p>
        <p>On Amtrak, public cell phone use has turned what was once a relaxing way to travel into a nerve-jangling experience. It is outrageous to pay a hefty price for a seat on a train only to be intruded upon by a cacophony of self-centered, semi-conversations.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Thank you for Joe Sharkey's column (Business Travel, June 21) about public cell phone use. At least, thus far, airplane passengers are subjected to this particular form of rudeness only while the plane is waiting to leave.</p>
        <p>On Amtrak, public cell phone use has turned what was once a relaxing way to travel into a nerve-jangling experience. It is outrageous to pay a hefty price for a seat on a train only to be intruded upon by a cacophony of self-centered, semi-conversations.</p>
        <p>Like cigarette smoking, public cell phone use is addictive to some, polluting to others. As it once did to accommodate smokers and nonsmokers, Amtrak should designate cell phone and non-cell phone cars. Users would be free to phone to their heart's content, and those of us who believe a train ride should provide us with the opportunity to read or think could once again enjoy noise-free air.</p>
