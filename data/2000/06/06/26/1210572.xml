        <p>I first met Mike Milbury in the late 1970's, when he played defense for the Boston Bruins and I worked in Chicago. During the playoffs, Montreal's Guy Lafleur lit up the Bruins for 5 points one night. After that game, I asked Milbury how the Bruins could stop Lafleur.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to cut off his head,'' Milbury said. ''Put that in your newspaper.''</p>
        <p>I did, editing out colorful language around the quote. Lafleur emerged from that tournament with both his skull and the Stanley Cup on his shoulders. Milbury continued a multidimensional career full of contentious moments and colorful comments.</p>
        <p>His decapitation threat resonated inside my head over the weekend after Milbury, now the general manager of the Islanders, dominated the National Hockey League entry draft with a series of trades and amateur selections that dramatically restructured his struggling team.</p>
        <p>Some executives, including Glen Sather of the Rangers, questioned Milbury's evaluation of talent and expressed skepticism about Milbury's building his roster around an 18-year-old rookie goalie, Rick DiPietro, who was chosen first over all out of Boston University.</p>
        <p>''They should mind their own business and worry about their own problems,'' Milbury said. As for gambling on DiPietro and other young players, Milbury said he knew the consequences of failure.</p>
        <p>''Then, off with the head,'' he said, referring to his own job.</p>
        <p>Certainly, he has lived through many a coup d'etat. As a player, Milbury helped lead the insurrection in the players association that resulted in the removal, conviction and imprisonment of Alan Eagleson, the union's executive director. In five years as general manager of the Islanders, Milbury has worked for five ownership groups, including one man who landed in jail for financial fraud.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, to back up DiPietro, Milbury acquired the veteran goalie John Vanbiesbrouck from Philadelphia in exchange for a fourth-round draft choice next summer. But a brush fire broke out when Roman Hamrlik, a veteran defenseman obtained by Milbury in a trade with Edmonton on Saturday, expressed his dismay with the deal.</p>
        <p>''Not a good team; they haven't been in the playoffs as long as I remember,'' Hamrlik said from his home in the Czech Republic. ''That's no fun. I want to be happy.''</p>
        <p>Hamrlik said he remembered visits to Nassau Coliseum as ''kind of disappointing.''</p>
        <p>''The fans didn't come,'' he continued. ''The team did not do well. The owner was cheap.''</p>
        <p>A few minutes later, Milbury called Hamrlik in an attempt to soothe his emotions, telling him: ''I hope you'll give us a chance. Give Long Island a chance. I'd really like you to be open-minded about it.''</p>
        <p>He said Hamrlik was ''probably as frustrated as I've been.'' Milbury and Hamrlik will begin contract negotiations shortly.</p>
        <p>Milbury no longer works under the budget restrictions of the previous ownership, but he remains an impatient boss, particularly with young talent. His era has featured trades of Zigmund Palffy, Eric Brewer, Roberto Luongo, Bryan Berard, Felix Potvin, Tommy Salo, Todd Bertuzzi, Bryan McCabe and Trevor Linden.</p>
        <p>A battle over the arena lease, instigated over Milbury's head, lowered the franchise to comical status two years ago. He has also created his own whirlpools with an edgy perspective and a sharp tongue, which served him well as a television commentator in the early 1990's but does not always enhance his aura as an executive.</p>
        <p>In a feud with one agent, Milbury said the man, by representing players, was depriving some village of a good idiot. During Milbury's brief tenure as coach of the Islanders, Ulf Samuelsson of the Rangers said Milbury used his mouth not to insult him but to spit in his direction.</p>
        <p>A few years before that, when Milbury was assistant general manager of the Bruins, he tried to crash the referees' dressing room to discuss rules philosophy. Long before that, when still a player, Milbury stormed the grandstand at Madison Square Garden during a brawl with spectators and beat a fan with the man's own shoe.</p>
        <p>A native of Massachusetts who played at an American college, Milbury entered the sport when such people were regarded with skepticism in a Canadian-dominated league. He had a point to prove and a chip on his shoulder and earned success at several levels. When Milbury expressed contempt this weekend for ''the hockey culture'' that frowns on choosing goalies high in the draft, it was possible to hear echoes of an era when it would have been far-fetched to imagine European coaches and American general managers.</p>
        <p>His decision to draft DiPietro came after extensive interviewing. Like Milbury, the young goalie is a New Englander from an American college. Like Milbury, DiPietro strikes many people as cocky and self-assured. It would not be too far-fetched to wonder if Milbury is banking on a young man who reminds him of himself.</p>
        <p>So Milbury, with a volatile personality, has increased the volatility around his franchise. In his team's market alone, Milbury's Islanders will compete with the Devils, defending their championship, and the Rangers, run by Sather, who is as brusque and self-assured as Milbury. We know Milbury was merely using hyperbole by threatening to take Lafleur to the guillotine. In the same figurative sense, the 2000-1 season on Long Island may include the rockets' red glare and bombs bursting in air.</p>
