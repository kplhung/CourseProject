        <p>The Liberty did not want to put a damper on Kym Hampton's retirement celebration at Madison Square Garden yesterday. But in came Los Angeles like an unwelcome guest to spoil the party and, perhaps, the Liberty's best game of the season.</p>
        <p>Despite an inspired effort by the Liberty, and a combined 35 points from the reserves Becky Hammon and Tamika Whitmore, the Sparks managed to be party poopers by defeating the Liberty, 72-67, before 14,717 fans yesterday. Hammon finished with a team-high 18 points, including three 3-pointers.</p>
        <p>The loss dropped the Liberty (5-7), the defending Eastern Conference champion of the Women's National Basketball Association, into fifth place in the conference, two games behind first-place Orlando.</p>
        <p>The Sparks (9-2) were led by their All-Star center, Lisa Leslie, who scored 20 of her game-high 22 points in the second half, before fouling out with 45 seconds remaining. Leslie was 12 of 16 from the free-throw line. So, too, were the Liberty.</p>
        <p>''We didn't get to the foul line as much as I thought we should have, but we had our chances,'' Liberty Coach Richie Adubato said. ''I thought we did a great job on Lisa in the first half, giving her 2 points. We played a zone and man which kept her under wraps, but then she just got a lot of big offensive rebounds.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, the Liberty may well have lost the game on the boards. Los Angeles outrebounded the Liberty, 43-29, scoring 13 points off the offensive boards in the first half alone.</p>
        <p>The Liberty still managed to respond whenever the Sparks seemed poised to take command of a game that neither team led by more than 6 points, that was tied 15 times and that had 15 lead changes. At the half, the Liberty led, 34-33.</p>
        <p>Leslie, a member of the United States Olympic team, said she was flustered in the first half by the Liberty's tight defense and a physical threesome of Tari Phillips, who finished with 12 points, 11 rebounds and 3 assists; Whitmore and Sue Wicks.</p>
        <p>Wicks (6 points in 19 minutes) and Vickie Johnson (2 points in 21 minutes) started for the Liberty despite flu symptoms.</p>
        <p>''They did a very good job of double-teaming and triple-teaming me inside,'' said Leslie, who was 1 for 8 in the first half. ''They were forcing me to take some really bad shots, and I really didn't have good shot selection. I was inbounding the ball and trailing, but not in the rhythm.''</p>
        <p>Leslie, who did not attempt a free throw in the first half, went to the line 16 times in the second half.</p>
        <p>This was the Liberty's fourth loss in six home games. At the start of the season, the Liberty, never more than a .500 road team, felt it could salvage the season by protecting its home court and breaking even on the road. Instead, the team finds itself with a better record on the road (3-3).</p>
        <p>''I don't know what's going on,'' said Crystal Robinson, who led the Liberty last season in 3-pointers but has struggled to regain her range after a sprained ankle last month. ''I seem to play better on the road than at home. I just can't find the basket at the Garden.''</p>
        <p>But Hampton, yesterday's guest of honor, believes the Liberty is only a few minor adjustments away from turning the corner.</p>
        <p>''They are,'' she said. ''Like with Crystal. I see everyone is playing her for her jump shot, so she's not getting as open as she was last year. It's real important for her to start slashing and going to the basket a lot, and that may give her a shot later on. And Tari, not letting the defense play her three-quarters. Just little things like that.''</p>
        <p>Then again, Hampton said, that is easy to say as an outsider looking in. Hampton retired at the end of last season. She attempted a comeback this year, trying to get one more year out of her ailing knee, only to retire again. She was given a LeRoy Neiman print of her shooting and a plaque that will be placed outside the Garden.</p>
