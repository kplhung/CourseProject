        <p>Stockwell Day, a 49-year-old flat-tax advocate and former treasurer of Alberta, has emerged as the front-runner in the race to lead Canada's new conservative party, the Canadian Alliance.</p>
        <p>In an upset, Mr. Day won 44 percent of votes cast Saturday night in a four-way leadership primary, surpassing Preston Manning, the party's 57-year-old founder, who won 36 percent.</p>
        <p>The winner of a July 8 runoff will be the man attempting to wrest control of Canada from the Liberals and their premier, Jean Chretien, in an election expected about one year from now. Mr. Chretien has governed since 1993.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Day and Mr. Manning, both Alberta natives, were each campaigning in Ontario, a voter-rich province that controls slightly more than one-third of the 301 seats in Canada's House of Commons.</p>
        <p>Winning votes in Ontario and eastern Canada was the main aim behind forming the Alliance three months ago from the Reform Party, a Western-based protest movement that in its 13 years of existence had never won parliamentary seats east of Canada's prairies.</p>
        <p>In 1997, in Canada's last parliamentary election, the Liberals won a majority in the House of Commons with 38 percent of the popular vote, largely because the nation's conservative vote, also 38 percent, split evenly between the Reform Party and the Progressive Conservatives.</p>
        <p>The Liberals continue to finish first in voter preference polls, but the Canadian Alliance has won rapidly growing support in recent months, indicating that many Canadians like its policies of cutting taxes and reducing government debts and deficits.</p>
        <p>Benefiting from heavy press coverage, three nationally televised candidate debates and the support of a new conservative newspaper, The National Post, the party's registration nearly tripled in three months, hitting 202,000 last week. Almost one third of the Alliance membership lives in Ontario.</p>
        <p>Leaders of Canada's traditional parties have taken note of the new unity and support behind the Alliance, painting the new grouping as socially conservative and confined to Canada's West -- a region that has only sent caretaker prime ministers to Ottawa in the last four decades.</p>
        <p>Early on, Mr. Chretien, a 66-year-old Quebecer, identified Mr. Day, a photogenic amateur athlete, as a threat to his own ambitions to win a third term as prime minister.</p>
        <p>In mid-March, just before the Liberal Party's national convention, Mr. Chretien criticized Mr. Day, who is also a former evangelical lay pastor, as ''an extreme conservative.'' Pursuing the same line of attack two weeks ago, the prime minister took time on a visit to Berlin to predict: ''The right of the right of the right will have Stockwell Day.''</p>
        <p>Canada's traditional conservatives have also been unnerved by the Alliance's rise. Tom Long, architect of two previous Progressive Conservative victories in Ontario, ran as the Ontario candidate for the Alliance leadership.</p>
        <p>Two weeks before the Saturday vote, Brian Mulroney, a Conservative who was prime minister from 1984 to 1993, came out of a self-imposed political silence of seven years and gave a speech excoriating the Canadian Alliance as divisionist. He begged conservatives to come home to the Progressive Conservatives, ''the party that founded Canada.''</p>
        <p>Today, Joe Clark, the leader of the Progressive Conservatives and briefly prime minister in 1979-80, appealed to Mr. Long and Ontario conservatives to abandon their flirtation with the new party.</p>
        <p>But, in a nation where liberal politics dominated the 1990's, the Alliance now seems to be the strongest force for shifting the political landscape. Mr. Long, 42, who polled a disappointing 18 percent in the leadership race, vowed to stick with the new party, saying Saturday night: ''I am more committed to the Canadian Alliance than I ever was.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Day, who speaks French and English and has lived in half of Canada's 10 provinces, stressed the national nature of the Alliance, telling cheering supporters at the party convention in Calgary Saturday night: ''The Canadian Alliance freedom train has left the station and is rolling across the nation.''</p>
