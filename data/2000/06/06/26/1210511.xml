        <p>IT is not often in the telecommunications industry that a big company hits an immediate, unmitigated home run with consumers. AT&amp;T's Digital One Rate wireless phone offering a couple of years ago, which eliminated roaming and long-distance fees, was one example. The 10-10 ''dial-around'' long-distance plans from MCI (now WorldCom) came close.</p>
        <p>Now, Bell Atlantic, the local phone giant, is in the middle of a positively Ruthian blast into the long-distance market in New York. By the end of next month, Bell Atlantic will almost surely announce that it has signed up a million long-distance customers in New York just since the beginning of this year.</p>

        <p>IT is not often in the telecommunications industry that a big company hits an immediate, unmitigated home run with consumers. AT&amp;T's Digital One Rate wireless phone offering a couple of years ago, which eliminated roaming and long-distance fees, was one example. The 10-10 ''dial-around'' long-distance plans from MCI (now WorldCom) came close.</p>
        <p>Now, Bell Atlantic, the local phone giant, is in the middle of a positively Ruthian blast into the long-distance market in New York. By the end of next month, Bell Atlantic will almost surely announce that it has signed up a million long-distance customers in New York just since the beginning of this year.</p>
        <p>That is something like a quarter-billion dollars in annual revenue swiped from the likes of AT&amp;T, WorldCom and Sprint in seven months. And you wonder why AT&amp;T's consumer long-distance business is shrinking.</p>
        <p>But here is the strange part: This trend is just getting started. Today, New York is the only state where consumers can buy long-distance service from their incumbent Bell company. By the end of the year, that is likely to be the case in at least four states: Connecticut, Georgia, New York and Texas. By the end of next year, that figure could be a dozen, or more, with California, Florida, Kansas, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania fairly likely to join the list.</p>
        <p>For this, the Bells have to thank the Federal Communications Commission, the Justice Department and their own new-found sobriety about just what it will take to win approval from those agencies to offer long-distance service. After years of yammering and breast-beating, the Bells have finally quieted down on this issue, mostly, and come to grips with the fact that the F.C.C. and the Justice Department are not going to be buffaloed. By slogging through the hard, unglamorous work necessary to win over the regulators rather than wailing to all and sundry about how unfairly they have been treated, the Bells have put themselves on the brink of getting all they really wanted from the Telecommunications Act of 1996: a chance to jump into the pot of gold they see in the long-distance market.</p>
        <p>It also didn't hurt that John Nakahata, a highly respected former chief of staff at the commission, was recently able to win approval for a deal he brokered that will reduce the per-minute access charges that long-distance companies pay to local carriers for connecting calls.</p>
        <p>That's a bit of a mouthful, and it gets even a little more complicated. But here is why it matters for the Bells' long-distance aspirations.</p>
        <p>For years, one of the biggest revenue streams for the Bell companies, and other local carriers like GTE, has been the billions of dollars they collect from the long-distance carriers for beginning and ending long-distance calls. Those per-minute fees have inflated long-distance rates for consumers.</p>
        <p>Now, as part of Mr. Nakahata's deal, the Bells may increase one of the fixed monthly fees they charge consumers, so from an overall revenue standpoint, the deal is supposed to be a wash for the Bells. (Of course, the long-distance companies like it because they can pay less to the local incumbents.)</p>
        <p>But shifting from the per-minute fees to the monthly charges helps open the road to the long-distance arena because it helps assuage fears both at the commission and at the long-distance companies that the Bells could ''double dip'' were they allowed into long-distance under the old regime.</p>
        <p>The fear was that the Bells would, with one hand, continue to collect the big per-minute fees while, with the other, enjoy unfair success in long-distance because the rates charged by the competition would be inflated by those very same fees.</p>
        <p>So by reducing the per-minute fees, the Nakahata deal levels the playing field to a certain extent.</p>
        <p>But the primary issue for the Bells remains the fact that before they are allowed to sell long-distance services in a given state, they must first convince the F.C.C. that they have opened their local networks in that state to competitors. In that regard, Bell Atlantic and the tough New York State regulators, who reviewed the Bell Atlantic case, have set the standard for the rest of the nation.</p>
        <p>In New York, Bell Atlantic had to pass a detailed and rigorous battery of tests devised by KPMG, the consulting firm, which tested whether Bell Atlantic's systems were capable of supplying competitive local phone companies with access to parts of Bell Atlantic's networks.</p>
        <p>The commission is not likely to accept anything less for any other state, and in the short run that has made life a bit tougher for the other Bells. A year ago, top executives from SBC Communications, which does business as Pacific Bell and Southwestern Bell, thought they could actually beat Bell Atlantic into long-distance by breaking into the Texas market. After they saw what Bell Atlantic went through in New York, however, they had to go back and come up with piles of additional documents to satisfy the regulators.</p>
        <p>But that additional work will pay off, because now SBC knows just what it has to do in other states. It appears that SBC is now a shoo-in to win long-distance approval in Texas, and the company is hoping to file applications for California and probably Kansas and Oklahoma in the next six months.</p>
        <p>In the Southeast, BellSouth is working hard in Georgia and is hoping to win long-distance approval for that state by Thanksgiving, though New Year's Eve is probably a more realistic target. BellSouth had not gone through serious testing in Georgia before seeing what Bell Atlantic did in New York, but has now gone back to conduct such tests.</p>
        <p>Bell Atlantic is trying to replicate its New York experience in Massachusetts, New Jersey and Pennsylvania while the laggard still appears to be U S West, which has agreed to be acquired by Qwest Communications International Inc.</p>
