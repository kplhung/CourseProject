        <p>Master's Touch  These were among his subjects: a copper pot, a washerwoman, a mother admonishing a child, a basket of wild strawberries. To all he brought emotional intensity and compositions of exquisite balance and beauty. He was Jean-Simeon Chardin (1699-1779). At 28, he was received into France's Academie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture as a ''skilled painter of animals and fruit.'' The great collectors of his day sought his work: Catherine the Great of Russia, Frederick the Great of Prussia and Louis XV of France, who granted Chardin living quarters in the Louvre from 1752 until his death. Beginning tomorrow, 67 works surveying Chardin's career will go on view at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Described as the first exhibition in New York to be devoted to the artist, ''Chardin'' continues through Sept. 3. Information: (212) 535-7710.</p>
        <p>All That Jazz  For aficionados of jazz, the compass points to Canada, where the 21st Montreal International Jazz Festival begins on Thursday. With music from A (a tribute to Louis Armstrong) to Z (for the bop-saxman John Zorn), with 300 free outdoor shows and 100 ticketed concerts involving some 2,000 musicians expected to draw 1.5 million listeners, the event continues through July 9. Among the artists scheduled to appear are Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Al Di Meola, Al Jarreau, Sonny Rollins, Ray Charles, John Lee Hooker and Dee Dee Bridgewater. Opening night festivities featuring the balladeer Shirley Horn start at 8:30 at the Salle Wilfrid-Pelletier in the Place des Arts. Information: (888) 515-0515.</p>

        <p>First Time  A world premiere by the Mark Morris Dance Group is the attraction at the London Coliseum, where Mr. Morris's version of Virgil Thomson and Gertrude Stein's ''Four Saints in Three Acts,'' with the orchestra and chorus of the English National Opera, will be presented on Wednesday. Performed by 14 dancers, the story depicts the lives of 16th-century Spanish saints and mystics. The 50-minute score, abridged by Thomson, is a mosaic of chants, madrigals and hymns that coexist with fanfares, marches and waltzes. ''Four Saints'' shares a bill with the Mark Morris's Dance Group's ''Dido and Aeneas.'' Information: 011-44-207-632-8300.</p>
        <p>Floor Show  It's outdoors and out to get everyone dancing. Midsummer Night Swing returns to Lincoln Center for 24 nights of dancing beginning on Wednesday. That's when the fiery Albita, the ''Cuban Madonna,'' brings Afro-Cuban vocal tradition to the party, which continues until July 29. This year's emphasis is on Latin music, from bossa nova to salsa and cumbia, which is not to say that swing bands and big bands won't be strutting their stuff. Each evening at the fountain plaza begins with instruction from 6:30 to 7:30, followed by dancing to the bands at 8:15. Information: (212) 875-5766.</p>
