        <p>If the Pittsburgh Pirates felt the sting of Mike Hampton's fiercely competitive nature yesterday, think of how his 4-year-old son feels.</p>
        <p>''I get in trouble about that all the time,'' Hampton said. ''My little boy just got a Nintendo, and my wife says I'm rubbing off on him because he's getting upset and throwing the remote. I get the blame for that. It's just something that's in my nature. My father instilled it in me. He said if you play something, you play 100 percent. He said, 'I don't care if you're playing checkers; you play to win.' ''</p>

        <p>If the Pittsburgh Pirates felt the sting of Mike Hampton's fiercely competitive nature yesterday, think of how his 4-year-old son feels.</p>
        <p>''I get in trouble about that all the time,'' Hampton said. ''My little boy just got a Nintendo, and my wife says I'm rubbing off on him because he's getting upset and throwing the remote. I get the blame for that. It's just something that's in my nature. My father instilled it in me. He said if you play something, you play 100 percent. He said, 'I don't care if you're playing checkers; you play to win.' ''</p>
        <p>And when he plays Nintendo games with young Michael, he tries to beat him?</p>
        <p>''Oh, definitely,'' Hampton said. ''My dad never let up on me. I'm not letting up on my son.''</p>
        <p>For nine innings yesterday at Shea Stadium, Hampton did not let up on the Pirates. He stifled them on five hits, allowing only two after the second inning, as the Mets breezed, 9-0, and completed a sweep of their three-game series. It was the most impressive of Hampton's 16 starts with the Mets and reminded baseball people why some of them may be willing to pay him $15 million a year (Kevin Brown's average annual salary with Los Angeles) when he becomes a free agent after the season.</p>
        <p>Hampton, who had a 22-4 record last season with Houston, is the kind of pitcher whom contenders would kill for, including the Mets if they did not already have him. The Mets, the Yankees and a bunch of other teams scour the major leagues for pitchers who could help them for the rest of the season, but they find No. 3 or No. 4 starters at best. No one close to Hampton's talent is available.</p>
        <p>That talent has finally resurfaced. In his first seven starts, Hampton had a 2-4, record, a 6.52 earned run average and 36 walks in 38 2/3 innings. In his last nine starts, he has a 5-1 record, a 1.60 E.R.A. and 19 walks (6 in one start) in 62 innings.</p>
        <p>''He hasn't tried to throw his 90-mile-an-hour fastball on every pitch,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said. ''He's using all of his pitches. He's competing with the hitters. It seemed like early he was competing with himself too much.''</p>
        <p>Valentine said he could not be certain, but perhaps Hampton was competing with the pitcher he was last season or with the expectations everyone had of him after the Mets acquired him from the Astros.</p>
        <p>''I was fighting with myself a little bit,'' Hampton acknowledged. ''I was trying to do a little too much out there and trying to prove myself to people that already believed in me. I went back to basics, keeping the ball down, throwing strikes early and working both sides of the strike zone.''</p>
        <p>In two of the first three starts of his effective period, the left-handed Hampton allowed no runs, but he did not pitch a complete game either time. Against Pittsburgh yesterday, he gave Valentine no reason to take him out.</p>
        <p>After the Pirates loaded the bases with two out in the fifth inning on a pair of singles and a walk, Hampton struck out Bruce Aven. He walked Brian Giles at the start of the sixth but promptly induced Kevin Young to ground into a double play. He struck out John Vander Wal for the third out, then set the Pirates down in order in each of the last three innings, finishing the game with a flourish and 12 consecutive outs.</p>
        <p>The Mets, meanwhile, peppered Kris Benson and two relievers for eight runs in their last three innings. Derek Bell keyed a two-run burst against Benson in the sixth with a neatly executed hit-and-run single and drove in two runs in the five-run seventh with a bloop single to center field that finished Benson.</p>
        <p>Josias Manzanillo, who spent parts of four seasons with the Mets, including 1999, replaced Benson and was battered for consecutive doubles by Edgardo Alfonzo and Mike Piazza and a single by Robin Ventura for three additional runs. Melvin Mora capped an outstanding day for him and the Mets by hitting a home run against Mike Williams in the eighth inning for his career-high fourth hit of the game.</p>
        <p>The Mets scored their five runs in the seventh despite Hampton's failure to sacrifice Joe McEwing to second. Hampton bunted foul with two strikes and slammed his bat to the ground in anger as he walked back to the dugout, thinking as he went, ''What are you doing?''</p>
        <p>''I don't like to fail,'' he said afterward. ''I was doing something I should do at least 9 out of 10 times. Luckily, Melvin got a hit and we got some runs that inning. If I get that bunt down, there's a guy on second and there's a base hit and he scores. But what if the next guy comes up and hits into a double play and we don't score? It's a whole different ballgame.''</p>
        <p>Not the way he was pitching.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>Outfielder JASON TYNER's first term with the Mets ended after the game. Tyner was optioned to Class AAA Norfolk, and MARK JOHNSON, an infielder and outfielder who was with the Mets from May 14 to May 28, was summoned to take his roster spot. Tyner batted .195 and drove in 5 runs in 13 games. . . . San Francisco Giants General Manager BRIAN SABEAN acknowledged that he had received  phone calls about shortstop RICH AURILIA, a player the Mets are interested in. The Mets have lost shortstop REY ORDONEZ for the season with a broken arm. . . . ROBIN VENTURA has a .359 batting average and 14 home runs with the bases loaded. He raised his runs batted in total to 156 yesterday with a bases-loaded walk. . . . The last time the Mets swept a three-game series against the Pirates was last October, when they used the sweep to force a playoff for the wild-card spot. AL LEITER shut out Cincinnati in that playoff, and MIKE HAMPTON's shutout yesterday was the first by a Mets starter since that game.</p>
