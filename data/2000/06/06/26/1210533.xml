        <p>Already low on cash and facing heavy criticism from international groups, the Internet's administrative body has been served with what is believed to be its first lawsuit challenging its work. The suit was filed by a New York company denied entrance to the lucrative business of registering Internet addresses, or domain names.</p>
        <p>The company, Afternic.com, which runs a Web site where people who already own domain names can resell them, filed the suit against the group, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or Icann, earlier this month.</p>
        <p>The company says Icann violated its own bylaws in refusing to approve Afternic's application to become an accredited primary registrar for Internet addresses.</p>
        <p>Icann was chosen by the Clinton administration in 1998 to run the Internet's domain name system. And only companies approved by Icann can offer first-time registrations in the popular domains of .com and .net and .org.</p>
        <p>In a statement, Icann denied treating Afternic unfairly.</p>
        <p>''Icann believes that it has handled Afternic's application in an appropriate manner, according to Icann policies and legal requirements, and consistently with the manner in which other applications have been handled,'' the group said.</p>
        <p>During a hearing in federal court in Manhattan on Thursday, Icann sought to have the case moved to California, where it is incorporated.</p>
        <p>Jon Whelan, co-chief executive of Afternic, said the company first applied to become an official registrar last October. But he said Icann had refused to act on the application, citing the company's involvement in the resale of domain names. Mr. Whelan said Louis Touton, Icann's vice president, told him that Icann was concerned about the peddling of trademarked domain names in the secondary market and was holding the application while the board considered how to deal with those issues.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, however, the two largest registrars of domain names, Network Solutions and Register.com, have begun offering resale services similar to Afternic's, Mr. Whelan said. Just last week Network Solutions announced that it would begin auctioning off domains that were registered but never paid for. And Icann renewed Register.com's accreditation after it entered that secondary market, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Whelan said that while Afternic had met all the criteria that Icann requires of registrars, Mr. Touton had ignored repeated requests for a meeting.</p>
        <p>''We are more qualified than 99 percent of the people accredited to do it,'' Mr. Whelan said Friday. ''They don't have the policy to deny us.''</p>
        <p>In its lawsuit, Afternic says Icann has violated its bylaws, which state that it ''shall not apply its standards, policies, procedures or practices inequitably or single out any particular party for disparate treatment unless justified by substantial and reasonable cause, such as the promotion of effective competition.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Whelan said his company was seeking immediate accreditation and damages for lost business.</p>
        <p>Icann has approved more than 100 companies and groups to be registrars. It has never denied one, but does have some, like Afternic's, on hold while concerns are resolved, an official said.</p>
        <p>Icann has been the subject of controversy since its inception. The group is also facing a revolt from companies that register names within so-called country codes, two-letter suffixes that represent geographic regions. Many of those operators are protesting bills they have been sent to help finance Icann's $5 million budget, saying Icann has never spelled out its legal jurisdiction over them.</p>
