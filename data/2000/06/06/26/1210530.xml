        <p>JUST as this summer's other spectacle of competition and humiliation, ''Survivor,'' has captured the public's attention, the great dot-com shakeout has garnered high ratings among business-minded voyeurs, who are making bets as to which Internet company will be the next to fall.</p>
        <p>As the dot-com survival game unfolds, executives at struggling Web sites are vying to secure a spot in the next round, which is widely believed to start sometime around the holiday season. By then, the reasoning goes, enough of the ''me too'' Internet start-ups will have died off, ensuring that the survivors receive more serious consideration from investors.</p>
        <p>Oddly enough, for the handful of lucky dot-com executives who either secured financing before the market dried up, or who enjoy the backing of a traditional company, these times are nearly as hectic. As they push their businesses toward profitability, these executives are watching the shakeout closely for signs of new competition, while at the same time trying to determine how much to participate in the weeding-out process.</p>
        <p>''Everyone's for sale,'' said Matt Hyde, vice president for online sales at Recreational Equipment Inc., or R.E.I., the outdoor-goods retailing co-op.</p>
        <p>As with many other e-tailing executives, Mr. Hyde said he had fielded numerous calls recently from competitors looking to be bought out, or from venture capitalists who are shopping around various companies that they have invested in, but cannot take public in this Internet-averse market.</p>
        <p>''While we look at it from an opportunity standpoint -- what are the assets we could bring to R.E.I.? -- we see this as a real competitive threat, as well,'' Mr. Hyde said.</p>
        <p>The threat changes, of course, from category to category, and often depends on the extent to which established bricks-and-mortar brands have made forays into the online world. In April, for instance, Estee Lauder, which had not yet created an online store for some of its brands, bought Gloss.com, thereby not only eliminating an online competitor, but giving Estee Lauder an online home for other brands within the company and significantly changing the competitive landscape in the beauty market.</p>
        <p>Mergers between Internet-only companies may also put a significant wrinkle into the power structure of a given market. Earlier this year, for instance, two Internet companies that cater to adventure travelers, Greentravel.com and AdventureQuest .com, merged to create Away.com. The new company, analysts and competitors said, is much stronger than either of the two sites that spawned it.</p>
        <p>And the merger created better competition for the online travel unit REI Adventures, as well as for other outdoor sites with travel operations. One such site is Altrec.com, which sells goods and travel services to outdoor enthusiasts.</p>
        <p>Michael Morford, Altrec's chief executive, said the shakeout among the Internet's outdoor retailers had led to more distractions than opportunities. ''Through this wave of consolidation,'' Mr. Morford said. ''at least 20 dot-coms have approached us, wanting to be acquired. Frankly, only two of them were worth talking with for more than a half-hour.''</p>
        <p>But the company has benefited from the shakeout in other ways. For instance, Mr. Morford said Altrec had been in negotiations with Cox Interactive Media to acquire GreatOutdoors.com, a content and community site for outdoor enthusiasts, before investors started fleeing Internet companies early this year.</p>
        <p>When the downturn took hold, he said, negotiations suddenly became easier, and early last month Cox sold the business to Altrec, while also investing an unspecified amount in Mr. Morford's company.</p>
        <p>''If market conditions had been different, the ease of that deal may not have been there,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Daniel Spira, chief executive of BareWalls.com, an online retailer of art prints and posters, said he was not as concerned about new competitors emerging from the consolidation. If merged sites ''are starting off bigger,'' he said, ''it might help them because their buying power could be more concentrated, but that's not everything you need. You still have to keep growing and improving.</p>
        <p>''Now that the gold rush mentality has puttered out, a lot of the competitors who were in it for the short term are starting to step aside. If you were in it for the short term, adding your business together with someone else's won't make it stronger.''</p>
        <p>Shelley Nandkeolyar, vice president for e-commerce at Williams-Sonoma, said his company was not in an acquisition mode, even though competitors like Cooking.com, ''have money to burn,'' he said, and could perhaps use that money to buy up distressed dot-coms.</p>
        <p>''For us, there's no pressure to go out there and act crazy,'' Mr. Nandkeolyar said. ''There's a lot of hype about consolidation, but frankly, I don't see the benefit of an acquisition. If I look at the cost of doing an acquisition versus what I could do with that money to invest in our brand, I'd much rather invest it here.''</p>
        <p>As to whether he worries about a stronger competitor emerging from the shakeout, Mr. Nandkeolyar said he welcomed competition. ''It's good for the industry, especially since it's in such a nascent stage,'' he said. ''We can learn from our competitors, and improve our own game.''</p>
        <p>Until this spring, of course, the competition within most e-commerce markets has resembled a steel-cage match in wrestling, with a constantly growing cast of characters, and participants coming up with ever-more-creative methods to edge their opponents.</p>
        <p>Given that the current e-commerce environment promises to diminish the number of participants in the dot-com free-for-all, Mr. Nandkeolyar and other executives will, analysts said, have fewer cues to rely on, as they refine their business approaches. And perhaps more important, in an investment environment in which the bottom line is king, some analysts fear that Internet retailers will devote less money and staff to innovations -- at least at the same pace as in the past.</p>
        <p>Cliff Sharples, chief executive of Garden .com, a home and garden e-tailer, said innovation and competition in different markets ''might well decrease.'' But Mr. Sharples, who is the founding chairman of Shop.org, an industry trade group, said, ''It hasn't yet affected consumers, and maybe it won't.''</p>
        <p>Though some of the less sturdy Internet concerns may, in fact, stagnate, he said, the category leaders will not. ''My gut feeling is that businesses with good models will continue to do smart investing,'' Mr. Sharples said. ''And they will continue to innovate.''</p>
