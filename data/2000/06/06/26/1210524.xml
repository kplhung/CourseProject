        <p>Mark Alessi is used to people calling him nuts. But this time, he acknowledges, they might actually be right.</p>
        <p>Mr. Alessi has just plunked down several million dollars to open a Florida-based comic-book publishing company, CrossGeneration Comics, at a time when even established comic-book publishers are having a difficult time.</p>
        <p>Everyone from Marvel Enterprises, the industry giant and home of Spider-Man, to small publishers like Mr. Alessi are fighting to increase sales. The task is becoming increasingly difficult as the number of comic-book shops drops and fewer newspaper stands and supermarkets carry the thin magazines that are often filled with pictures of macho men, well-endowed women and vicious villains.</p>
        <p>Even the superhero genre -- the books that generally power sales -- may be in need of rescue. While tales of characters gifted with superhuman abilities continue to be popular among the mostly middle-class, white men who have grown up reading comic books, they do not necessarily pull in the younger, more diverse readers who would help the industry increase sales.</p>
        <p>''Most people are still trying to survive in a milieu that doesn't work anymore,'' said Justin Savage, president and editor of Saber's Edge Associates Studios, a small collective of artists in Minneapolis. ''The market is getting smaller because people get sick of it or die off.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Alessi, a millionaire who sold his high-technology consulting firm to Ross Perot in 1996, was complaining about the current state of the industry one day when friends goaded him into starting his own company. Mr. Alessi is frank about what he feels is a growing unhappiness with comics. In the introduction to his CrossGenesis series, he writes, ''Anyone even remotely involved in the industry recognizes that the growing reader dissatisfaction is a clear signal that we who create comics haven't been doing our job well enough.''</p>
        <p>Crossgeneration and other comic book companies are trying a variety of tactics to pull in new readers. This fall, in an attempt to strike a chord with today's overanalyzed youth, a young Spider-Man will be sent to therapy.</p>
        <p>The heroes in the Wildstorm Productions series Authority will not only make the world a better place, but they will even go as far as to kill anyone who disagrees with them about the best way to do that. And Mr. Alessi's Meridian series, instead of featuring the overendowed, underdressed women that are the norm for superhero comics, will feature a 14-year-old girl who will use her healing powers to save the universe.</p>
        <p>Comic books have never had it easy. In 1954, the nation was so worried about comics leading to deviance and perversion among young people -- parents were upset about everything from the violence found in certain comics to the rumor that Batman and Robin were gay -- that a Senate subcommittee even held hearings on the effects of comic books.</p>
        <p>The first American comic books in the 1930's, unlike their more artsy European counterparts, were collections of comic strips that has appeared in newspapers. Sales shot up with the birth of Superman in 1938. By the 1950's, superheroes were synonymous with comic books and remained the most popular genre.</p>
        <p>''At its most basic level, it's an adolescent power fantasy,'' said Jeff Brown, an associate professor of popular culture at Bowling Green State University in Ohio who taught a graduate seminar on the superhero comic last fall. ''It's a kind of linchpin. If the hero disappeared, comics would disappear in North America.''</p>
        <p>The death of Superman in the early 90's led to the current slump in the comic-book industry, some industry insiders said. When Superman was reborn, speculators drove up sales by buying up huge quantities of the first issue. Mitch Cutler, the owner of St. Mark's Comics in New York, remembers trying to dissuade one businessman from buying 500 copies so that his regulars could still find the comic.</p>
        <p>Others say the industry's current problems started when Marvel began to have financial difficulties in the early 90's. The company, which eventually filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, was beset by troubles with management. Now, Marvel has a new management team and is focusing its efforts on using tie-ins with Hollywood to pull more readers into comic-book shops.</p>
        <p>Even the staunchest supporters of comic books say that the industry is facing problems in everything from production to distribution to marketing.</p>
        <p>There are no hard and fast figures for the industry. Publishers and distributors are secretive about sales. In fact, the only figure that insiders agree upon is the number of comic-book stores. Today, there are fewer than 4,000, down from more than 10,000 during the comic boom in the mid-90's. ''I think people like comics as much as ever, but now it's very difficult to buy them,'' said Stan Lee, creator of Spider-Man and an icon in the industry. ''There used to be so many places to buy comic books; there used to be a corner store in every city.''</p>
        <p>And comic books, according to one retailer, are like milk. If they are not sold in the first week they are issued, they spoil.</p>
        <p>Marvel, DC Comics, Image Comics and Dark Horse Comics, four of the largest companies, all have direct sales distribution contracts with Diamond Comic Distributors of Timonium, Md.</p>
        <p>Diamond became the dominant distributor in the 1990's, after a failed attempt by Marvel to move  in on the distribution business. Marvel acquired Hero's World, an East Coast comic-book distributor, in the early 90's. Soon after, the company announced that Hero's World would distribute only Marvel comics and that only Marvel comics would be sold through Hero's World. The move forced most of the other established distribution companies out of business. Several of Marvel's competitors signed with Diamond. Marvel eventually left the comic-book distribution business, and Diamond was the only major distributor left.</p>
        <p>Comic-book shop owners grumble about having to go through Diamond to get Marvel or DC comics. They say the company treats them like adversaries, rather than partners.</p>
        <p>Stephen A. Geppi, the chief executive at Diamond, which is privately owned, did not return phone calls requesting comment.</p>
        <p>Customers have their own complaints. They say retailers are becoming more conservative in their ordering and do nott carry the books they want. Luciana Machado, who started reading comics at the suggestion of her boyfriend almost 15 years ago, said she often had problems getting back orders of comics. But Ms. Machado insisted that she remained a loyal comic fan, though she dumped the boyfriend long ago.</p>
        <p>Retailers, most of whom are comic-book aficionados, say placing large orders has become riskier because books cannot be returned to Diamond, which makes them order everything sight unseen two months ahead of time.</p>
        <p>And though artists like Will Eisner, the father of a more serious genre of comic book, the graphic novel, continue to pull in readers with weighty discussions of religion and morality, the fate of the comic book may depend on the superhero genre.</p>
        <p>''The system is set up, the customer base and the distribution is set up, so that the industry speaks to itself,'' said Bill Jemas, Marvel's president of publishing, new media and consumer products. ''What we're doing as an industry for the first time in a few years is the first effort to get new readers.''</p>
