        <p>So if you give merchants a green light to spam you, and they do, have you been spammed?</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, those who make their livings from junk -- or, in their words, promotional e-mail -- answer with a resounding no. Now, they say they can prove they are right.</p>
        <p>FloNetwork of Toronto, a company that handles promotional e-mail for merchants, sent e-mail messages to about 1,000 people who regularly buy things on the Internet to ask their feelings about spam versus so-called permission-based e-mail -- messages that go only to consumers who have clicked the button on a Web page indicating that they would welcome updates, promotional material and such.</p>
        <p>FloNetwork's conclusion? ''People hate spam, but they love permission-based e-mail,'' said Regina A. Brady, a FloNetwork vice president.</p>
        <p>Actually, that is overstating it on both sides. Most of the respondents said they got about 10 pieces of unsolicited promotional material a week, and only a third of them saw it as a major invasion of privacy. Two percent actually liked it. But a majority -- 65 percent -- did not care about it one way or the other; they just deleted it upon arrival. By contrast, 94 percent of those responding said they occasionally gave permission to merchants to send them e-mail. And 58 percent said they thought permission-based e-mail was an excellent way to learn about products, services and promotions.</p>
        <p>Tempting as it might be to think of the surveys themselves as spam, they were in a sense permission-based e-mail. Those surveyed were already volunteer members of an online panel that National Family Opinion uses to gauge the popularity of various Internet sites and methods.</p>
