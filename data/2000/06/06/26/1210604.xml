        <p>Ting Jiang, near here, is known locally as the ''widow's village,'' a quiet former farming town whose dwindling population consists almost entirely of old people, children and women. Residents estimate that the town has lost more than 80 percent of its men between the ages of 20 and 40 in the last 10 years.</p>
        <p>But don't weep for Ting Jiang. It is an unabashedly prosperous place, peppered with lavish multistory tile houses, some with elevators and pools. The kids wear Gap clothes. Cell phones are a standard accessory. And its widows are only widows in the Sunday football sense: Ting Jiang's missing men are still very much alive -- almost all working illegally in restaurants and on construction sites, thousands of miles away, in the United States.</p>
        <p>Increasingly, their ''widows'' are following. ''Of course I plan to go to join my husband,'' said a woman from Ting Jiang who gave only her family name, Shi. Ms. Shi calls her husband weekly at a phone number that begins with 904 -- a.k.a. northern Florida.</p>
        <p>''We know exactly what life is like there,'' she said. ''Sure, work is hard, but with tips you can make more than $2,000 a month.'' Here in Fujian Province, with casual labor, they can earn the equivalent of $40, she said, adding: ''So no one in the village works before they go to America. There's no point.''</p>
        <p>Just days after the British authorities discovered the bodies of 58 Chinese who were being smuggled into England in the back of a tomato truck, the grisly news was all the talk in the towns around Fuzhou, home to some if not all of the dead.</p>
        <p>But people here regarded it with the same mixture of sadness and disengagement that frequent fliers have when they hear of a plane crash. They may hesitate awhile, but they will go again. For places like Ting Jiang, the long, arduous and expensive journeys that hundreds of thousands of Chinese have undertaken to be smuggled to the West have generally proved a satisfying and sound economic investment.</p>
        <p>And that despite a cost of up to $70,000 that must be paid to the smugglers -- called snakeheads -- who make the travel arrangements, and despite the tortuous emigration sagas, which at best involve flying through a series of countries with forged travel documents and at worst mean crossing borders on foot or packed in airless trucks, disguised as tomatoes.</p>
        <p>''This is a calculated risk, like many others that rational people take,'' said a Western scholar, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the Chinese consider the issue of illegal immigration so sensitive. ''People live in California even though there are earthquakes. Most of the Chinese do get through and are very successful, both in terms of sending money home and bringing more relatives over.''</p>
        <p>In fact there are relatively few attractive employment options in this seaside area of southern China, where most of China's recent illegal immigrants to the West come from.</p>
        <p>Farming pays little. There is little local industry. The people have rural residency permits and cannot legally move to Chinese cities. Although millions of rural migrants live in cities like Shanghai and Beijing, they live on the fringes of society, working in the most menial jobs.</p>
        <p>Moving to New York or Los Angeles is a better-tested strategy here, and certainly more rewarding. In fact, you could say that in places like Ting Jiang or Changle, a township near Fuzhou, emigration to the West is the local industry, which most men enter by the time they are 30.</p>
        <p>Those who have the means pay for airplane travel, avoiding what are widely acknowledged to be the greater hazards and hardships of an overland or boat passage. Those who lack the means go anyway.</p>
        <p>Chinese officials are cracking down on smuggling, and those who are caught are jailed or fined. And in the wake of the deaths in England, local officials here were aggressively detaining foreign reporters to avoid coverage of what they termed an embarrassing story.</p>
        <p>Western embassies in China have highlighted the sufferings of illegal migration, but to little effect. ''To be successful locally means you have to emigrate,'' the Western scholar said. ''That is the local definition of success.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Shi estimates that in her generation alone, dozens from her extended family have gone illegally to the United States, including her husband and three of four siblings. The first one went in the late 1980's. Since then, those who are there have helped those who wanted to follow, lending money to pay for the passage, providing shelter and first jobs, setting up appointments with American immigration lawyers. It has only gotten easier.</p>
        <p>Her oldest brother first tried in 1990, by paying a snakehead for overland passage via Europe. He was arrested in Austria and sent home again. His next attempt -- aboard the now infamous freighter Golden Venture, which ran aground off New York in June 1993 -- landed him in an Immigration and Naturalization Service prison for two years. He applied for asylum but ultimately gave up and went home to China.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, Ms. Shi said, he took a package tour to Thailand, where he went AWOL as planned and met up with his snakehead. Traveling on false documents, he was flown to a third country and then, after two months, to the United States, where he now works in a restaurant.</p>
        <p>Since then, Ms. Shi's older sister has also gone by plane. With ample financing from relatives in America, the family has now generally sworn off the most complicated routes and certainly boat travel, which they consider more dangerous.</p>
        <p>A cousin overstayed a fake business visa (price, $50,000). Ms. Shi's 25-year-old brother, a university graduate, is hoping that the snakehead will provide him with a fake marriage to an American ($70,000).</p>
        <p>The huge immigration flow that has sprinkled hundreds of thousands of Chinese across the United States and Europe is remarkably localized in its origin, with a vast majority of migrants coming from a small number of townships surrounding Fu zhou. Because of the distances involved, experts say, smuggling Fujianese has become a vast multinational business that some have described as immensely profitable. Prices are based on market principles, depending on the route chosen and local demand. For example, people here say passage to the United States (about $60,000) is more expensive than passage to England (about $45,000), which is in turn more expensive than passage to Hungary or Japan (about $12,000).</p>
        <p>After more than a decade of development, certain towns have acquired self-perpetuating predilections for certain destinations.</p>
        <p>In Fuqing the destination of choice is Japan. In Sanming it is Eastern and Central Europe, often Hungary, where a large Chinese community has taken root since the fall of Communism in Europe in 1989 loosened travel across the former Soviet bloc. And in the more prosperous areas of Changle and Ting Jiang, the United States is the end point.</p>
        <p>The routes vary from snakehead to snakehead and month to month, depending on where the international smuggling rings can find safe havens and obtain the required counterfeit visas or passports.</p>
        <p>Experts say passage to the United States often involves several stops, perhaps a three-month stint in Latin America before crossing over from Mexico, or a stay in Hong Kong or Guam, for example. Although nobody knows for sure, academics and residents of Fujian said grueling boat journeys are probably less common than other routes.</p>
        <p>Experts say the worst abuses generally occur during slow periods, since some snakeheads then allow poor migrants to pay on credit plans that leave them deeply in debt or travel to new towns to recruit naive passengers.</p>
        <p>But studies suggest that this is the exception. In a recently published book about Fujianese migrants, ''Smuggled Chinese,'' Ko-Lin Chin of Rutgers University reported that a vast majority of the 300 people he studied had borrowed their passage fees from relatives at little or no interest. And 86 percent said they were having no trouble meeting their financial obligations.</p>
        <p>While people here say there are certainly good and bad snakeheads, they generally regard them as honest businessmen providing a valuable service. They point out that most snakeheads collect the bulk of their fees once the migrants have safely arrived at their destination.</p>
        <p>More important still, since a snakehead's business is through word of mouth, he will quickly go bankrupt if his human cargo is routinely intercepted or, worse, ends up dying in a truck of tomatoes.</p>
        <p>[Reports from Fujian this weekend in the Hong Kong press said the snakehead who had organized the fatal trip to England had been forced to flee his hometown, his house stoned by angry locals.]</p>
        <p>The migrants are a mixed group of high- and middle-income Chinese, the poorest usually excluded by the high fees demanded by the traffickers. When they get to their destination, they either disappear into the vast local Fujianese community or -- if they are from wealthier families -- they may even find a lawyer to request political asylum.</p>
        <p>''The women say they are fleeing China's family planning system,'' said one man, explaining that they may be forced to undergo sterilization if they have two sons, for example. He added that ''another popular method is to say you're a member of Falun Gong and your family is being persecuted.'' China banned the Falun Gong spiritual group last summer and has arrested thousands of members who have refused to renounce its practices.</p>
        <p>Although the illegal immigrants know that such attempts are generally unsuccessful, they often calculate bail fees into the cost of the journey to America and avoid potential jail time, people here said.</p>
        <p>Also, the asylum process can last for years, allowing them time to establish roots in the West in the meantime. They get jobs, sometimes marry Americans and have babies -- who get American passports.</p>
        <p>Towns like Ting Jiang are frequently home to such American-born babies, whose hard-working parents send them back to China to be raised by grandparents.</p>
        <p>Plenty of money goes home too: by 1993, $30 million at the Changle branch of the Bank of China came from overseas, according to Professor Chin's book. Much of the money goes to building and decorating huge, elaborate family homes, as much status symbols as residences, since only one or two older family members are left in China to live there.</p>
        <p>In the short term, life in the United States is terribly hard even for the more successful migrants, who tend to work long hours at low wage jobs to pay relatives back for their passage. As illegal immigrants, they live in fear, often afraid to enrol children in school or visit a hospital. Despite frequent phone calls, they are separated from families.</p>
        <p>Ms. Shi's brother-in-law, who is only now applying for political asylum in Los Angeles, has not seen his teenage children since they were toddlers.</p>
        <p>But with so many routes, and so many relatives already living abroad, people like Ms. Shi count on a bright future overseas, even though they cannot predict exactly when or how they will get there.</p>
        <p>''I will probably go in two or three years, since my husband is up for asylum soon,'' said Ms. Shi. Then she shrugged, saying, ''If that doesn't work, I'll find another way.''</p>
