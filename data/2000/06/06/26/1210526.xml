        <p>THE SLEEP-OVER ARTIST  By Thomas Beller  297 pages. W. W. Norton &amp; Company. 23.95.</p>
        <p>A certain New York specificity can be found in Thomas Beller's tales of Alex Fader, who grows up on Riverside Drive, celebrates birthdays at the Russian Tea Room and has the kind of classmate whose parents, ''for a fee equal to about two years' school tuition for their son,'' hold a bar mitzvah reception at Windows on the World. When at another such party, this time at the Plaza Hotel, the adolescent guests engage in an ugly ''Lord of the Flies''-type scene in the ladies' room, Alex is not all that surprised to hear a schoolboy tell the grownups with walkie-talkies: ''What are you going to do?  You're just security guards. We pay you guys.''</p>
        <p>Later on Alex plays drums in a rock band, briefly holds the unenviable job of personal assistant to a film producer, lucks into his aunt's rent-stablized apartment under poignant circumstances and tries his hand at television and documentary filmmaking. There is, in other words, nothing all that novel or fascinating about the particular events that Mr. Beller describes.</p>
        <p>But ''The Sleep-Over Artist,'' a loosely novelistic collection of stories about Alex, manages to be a frank, likable book with an appealing central character, even if there is nothing momentous about his title propensity for sleeping away from home. That habit is revealing only insofar as it keeps Alex constantly on tenterhooks, whether with childhood friends or adult lovers. Always, in ways that Mr. Beller describes intently, he seems to be wondering where he fits in.</p>
        <p>The book follows Alex from his first appearance, as a 6-year-old mischievously throwing water out his apartment window, to when as an adult, he attends a fractious tenants' meeting to decide whether the building's windows need to be replaced. Along the way it sustains a lively sense of New York mores in general, and Upper West Side residential and mating habits in particular, while watching Alex develop into a keen student of interpersonal dynamics.</p>
        <p>''Her hostility, he thought, was promising,'' Mr. Beller writes about one lengthy affair described here. ''If someone takes you home and is rude to you, he felt, that means they're already hating you for what they are about to let you do.''</p>
        <p>From the first Alex is a knowing observer, calling one grade-school colleague ''a cynical and manipulative creep who had been popular and attractive ever since he stood up in the sandbox.'' Of an adult he encounters during these same school years, he remarks: ''He seemed very intent on communicating his love for science and for nature. But what he best communicated was that if you loved little animals, and the theory of evolution, and spat a little when you talked, and had feelings, then you would be a science teacher whose best friends were gerbils.''</p>
        <p>Alex manages to get himself expelled from a private high school for starting a renegade student newspaper and sending it to parents. Because of this, he says, ''the school was inundated with irate letters and phone calls demanding to know what kind of school was this that they could have an illiterate going unnoticed in its midst?'' He eventually uses this debacle as the basis for a short film that is mentioned in an article about New York's private schools. ''It was one of those part-news, part-lifestyle articles that manage to make a certain schadenfreude-sensitive segment of the population react as thought the dentist had accidentally drilled through a nonanesthetized tooth,'' Mr. Beller writes.</p>
        <p>Although ''The Sleep-Over Artist'' finds much room for such sidelong atmospheric commentary (and for trying to establish a sense of history with references to yippies, to Alex's boyhood favorite pornography show on television and to the guy who used to study Bob Dylan's garbage), its real focus is on the series of women Alex encounters. From the elderly aunt drifting into an Alzheimer's haze to her housekeeper, whom Alex locks in a bathroom in an exchange  that seems as startling to him as it will to readers, women dominate the book's landscape.</p>
        <p>They all seem older and more powerful than Alex, and all seem to have the upper hand, even the one he persuades to make love while ''Apocalypse Now'' (his video rental of choice) is on the television screen. Once he loses his father as a fifth-grader and settles into an awkward closeness with his mother, he appears to be seeking motherly attention wherever he goes.</p>
        <p>The longest section of the book, ''Seconds of Pleasure,'' tells of his affair with an English woman named Katrina whose own little boy is somehow a factor in the romance. ''He thought of the son while he kissed the mother,'' Mr. Beller acknowledges, with a typical bit of unabashed detail. The liaison is described exhaustively, right from its not very promising start. ''She regarded him as one might regard an interesting piece of driftwood washed up on a beach -- would it look good on the mantel? --  before deciding it was simply not worth carrying back to the house,'' he writes of their meeting.</p>
        <p>Along with most of the segments,  Alex and Katrina's story has appeared previously as magazine fiction. In fact, ''Seconds of Pleasure'' was published in episodes by two different publications, and the lack of consistency and urgency shows. As a book, ''The Sleep-Over Artist'' is a beguiling but meandering hybrid of short story collection and novel, with more repetition than it needs and an overall scarcity of focus. Not even when Alex begins commuting to London does it entirely outgrow its New York boyhood beginnings and move on to the wider world.</p>
