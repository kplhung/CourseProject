        <p>In a muted ceremony commemorating the outbreak of war on the Korean peninsula 50 years ago, President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea paid tribute today to the soldiers who fought and those who died in the conflict, which continues to divide the North and the South.</p>
        <p>Addressing thousands of veterans and visiting dignitaries at the War Memorial in downtown Seoul, Mr. Kim called for a continuation of the steps toward peace that began this month when he and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, held their first summit meeting, in Pyongyang.</p>
        <p>Despite an agreement between the two leaders to seek peace and reconciliation, Kim Dae Jung today urged South Korea's military, which is locked in a tense standoff with Communist North Korean troops on the border, to remain on alert.</p>
        <p>''Until unification is actually fully achieved and a firm guarantee of peace is arranged, we cannot afford to relax,'' South Korea's leader said in a televised speech. ''Peace can be guaranteed only through a tight defense posture. We should not allow the slightest gap in our security.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kim's remarks appeared intended to address widespread criticism over his government's decision to scale back celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the start of the Korean War to avoid offending North Korea, which said that it had canceled all its war commemorations to maintain a spirit of cooperation.</p>
        <p>But war veterans from South Korea and abroad said they were insulted that the South Korean government had canceled an annual military parade and the scheduled battle re-enactments. This morning's opening ceremony, which was attended by about 10,000 people, including veterans from 21 countries who participated in the conflict. But aside from that ceremony and a few other quiet events, the war anniversary went largely unnoticed in South Korea.</p>
        <p>The war began on June 25, 1950, after North Korea invaded the South.</p>
        <p>The fighting officially ended in 1953. The two sides signed an armistice agreement, but technically they are still at war.</p>
        <p>Russia and China took the side of the North while the United States led a United Nations force fighting for the South. About three million people died on both sides, including an estimated 900,000 Chinese troops and 30,000 Americans.</p>
        <p>There were benign commemorative events today -- seminars, the laying of wreaths at cemeteries and battlefields, war exhibitions, and luncheon and dinner parties for the veterans. But those ceremonies were overshadowed by several boisterous street protests calling for the withdrawal of the 37,000 United States troops from South Korea.</p>
        <p>''Let's kick out the United States military,'' a group of student protesters shouted in downtown Seoul. ''Until that time, we can't be happy.'' There were no arrests of protesters, most of whom were college students.</p>
        <p>Officials of the United States and South Korea have said neither government has plans to remove the American troops, which they said serve as a stabilizing force on the peninsula and in Asia.</p>
        <p>In Washington today, Vice President Al Gore, standing in front of a score of veterans seated at the foot of the Tomb of the Unknowns in Arlington National Cemetery, remembered those who fought in the Korean War. June 25, Mr. Gore said, ''will live in honor,'' and the anniversary is a day when Americans will remember the veterns of war and their sacrifices.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate, said that while looking into the past to remember this day, it is also important to look to the future. Pointing to the recent summit meeting between the North and South Korean leaders, Mr. Gore said the region was moving toward ''a new progress for peace.''</p>
        <p>North Korea made no comment today on the war anniversary. The Rodong Shinmun, an organ of the North's ruling Workers Party, did not carry an editorial on the anniversary, unlike in previous years when it used the occasion to denounce the South's grand celebrations, according to Yonhap, a South Korean news service.</p>
