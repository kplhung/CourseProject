        <p>Driving the roads around Pound Ridge, Bedford and Crossriver makes one ponder the cultural impulse behind these ribbons of black-topped perfection. Here, among elegant arbors and houses aged with a subtle perseverance usually reserved for cheese or wine, money speaks in stage whispers.</p>
        <p>Art and the upscale life have reconciled themselves at the Caramoor Festival, which opened its summer season tonight. Citizens of Westchester County poured onto the grounds of this erstwhile summer estate; the Orchestra of St. Luke's, framed by the ancient imported columns of the Venetian Theater, were here to make them happy.</p>
        <p>Caramoor has gotten ambition and evidently is enjoying the means to finance it. Experiencing for most of its 55 years the joys and hazards of al fresco entertainment, the festival is now fitted with a permanent tent roof and the most elegant folding chairs I have ever seen. It has added an opera program led by Will Crutchfield and is sponsoring chamber music and young performers as well. A modest endowment is in place and seems to be growing.</p>
        <p>If Caramoor's music asked to be heard on Saturday, the assembled captains of industry desired to be seen. Tuxedoed men exchanged hearty greetings in the aisles. Women experienced the triumphs and heartbreak of high fashion. More casual listeners occupied the surrounding lawns and picnicked.</p>
        <p>The music had a lot in common with the homes that line these roads. If house exteriors juggle constant upkeep with endearing patination, so this program, conducted by Peter Oundjian and featuring the cellists Yo-Yo Ma and Edward Arron, gathered some of the oldest modern music in the repertory.</p>
        <p>The Elgar Cello Concerto achieved a modest fame in the recent film ''Hilary and Jackie,'' while Stravinsky's ''Firebird'' Suite is more famous than it needs to be. The Elgar is a sweet, affecting piece and a triumph of sincerity over sustained invention. Even when the inspiration flags and the substances runs thin, the heart-on-sleeve gestures ring true and always please. The ''Firebird,'' although played with energy here, has long sinced been mined of possible revelation or surprise and sets the ear on automatic pilot.</p>
        <p>Completed by a very beautiful two-cello concerto in G minor by Vivaldi, this was a program calculated to inspire, not roil the digestions of listeners awaiting banquets under adjacent tents. Mr. Ma milked it all with wonderful skill and carried Elgar's grand tactics over into the Vivaldi, where they were handsomely echoed by Mr. Arron.</p>
        <p>The early-music movement, in other words, had the evening off. This was modern old-fashioned style, not to be confused with modern neo-antiquarian style. The first is up-to-date by virtue of playing in the 19th-century way. The second advertises its cutting edge by imitating the century before. Such are the politics of musical style, which seem to make sense only to those deeply immersed in them.</p>
        <p>Fortunately bigness did not preclude elegance tonight, and Mr. Ma was near faultless. I find his grimaces increasingly difficult to watch, but then my job is to listen, and this is a wonderful player. The acoustics of the Venetian Theater do not escape the penalties of outdoor music.</p>
        <p>But if the deeper orchestral resonances dissipated into the night air, left behind is an acute sense of winds and brass in the higher registers. This turned the Stravinsky into a chamber music that benefited nicely from Mr. Oundjian's careful attention to detail.</p>
        <p>Caramoor events run Thursday through Sunday until mid-August.</p>
