        <p>The Yankees, who had faced a deadline today to persuade Juan Gonzalez to sign a contract extension that would enable them to complete a three-for-one trade with the Detroit Tigers, have received more time to pursue the negotiations.</p>
        <p>A baseball official who has had conversations with both teams said the Yankees received an extension today beyond the 72-hour window to continue their discussions with Jim Bronner, Gonzalez's agent, in the hopes of getting an agreement. The original deadline was at noon today, and the Yankees are now believed to have until at least 6 p.m. Monday.</p>
        <p>Because the Yankees are also talking with the Chicago Cubs about Sammy Sosa, continuing to negotiate with Gonzalez gives them more options and allows them to play the Tigers and the Cubs against each other in the hopes of completing one of the deals.</p>
        <p>Some baseball officials say they believe it is more likely that the Yankees will acquire Sosa than Gonzalez. If the Yankees are able to reach an agreement with the Cubs on players for Sosa, the baseball officials say, they will have an easier time negotiating a contract extension with Sosa than they have had with Gonzalez.</p>
        <p>The Yankees had internal conference calls today about Gonzalez and Sosa and also discussed other options that they could pursue if these attempts dissipate. While the Yankees are most interested in Gonzalez and agreed in principle to a trade on Thursday night, Gonzalez has been reluctant to sign a contract extension. The Yankees do not want to trade outfielder Ricky Ledee, third baseman Drew Henson, their top prospect, and the Class AA pitcher Randy Keisler to Detroit with no guarantee that Gonzalez would stay beyond this season.</p>
        <p>''Waiting,'' Gonzalez said as he walked past reporters today in Cleveland, where he did not play because of a bruised left ankle. He later added, ''I don't know what's happening outside,'' regarding the discussions with the Yankees.</p>
        <p>Even if the Yankees are still skeptical about persuading Gonzalez to sign an extension, extending the negotiating window could help their strategy. By keeping the Gonzalez talks going, the Yankees can keep a little pressure on the Cubs. If the Gonzalez situation dies, the Cubs could ask the Yankees for a better package for Sosa. The Tigers will probably not find a better match for Gonzalez than the Yankees and like the package the Yankees have offered, so they are also interested in continuing the dialogue.</p>
        <p>If the Yankees fail to get either power hitter, they may make a strong attempt to acquire Baltimore's B. J. Surhoff.</p>
        <p>Because the Yankees have never officially acknowledged that there was a 72-hour window to complete the three-for-one trade for Gonzalez, General Manager Brian Cashman refused to discuss the Gonzalez situation. Cashman would not field questions about the Yankees' increased interest in Sosa, either.</p>
        <p>As the Yankees grew more skeptical Saturday about the chances of signing Gonzalez, they rekindled discussions with the Cubs about Sosa. The Cubs had asked for five elite prospects for Sosa, which cooled the Yankees' interest. Now the Cubs seem willing to consider a lesser package.</p>
        <p>The Yankees are struggling and, like Gonzalez, are waiting. When the Yankees were stranded here for three hours before traveling to Detroit to begin a three-game series, it was something they were used to from the last four days: another delay involving Detroit.</p>
