        <p>In the end, it was a simple candle, knocked over by one of the squatters, that put an end to the famous City Hotel, lighting up the nighttime sky in Freetown the way its guests had long ago.</p>
        <p>The City Hotel, which Graham Greene turned into one of Africa's enduring literary landmarks in ''The Heart of the Matter,'' had survived the end of the British empire, the postcolonial slide into squalor and decay and in the last decade, rebel invasions that destroyed many other buildings on the street.</p>
        <p>But in the predawn hours of May 2, a few days before British paratroopers landed here and helped save Freetown from yet another rebel assault, and a couple of weeks before the start of the rains that might have made the old building's wooden beams more resistant to the hungry flames, the fateful candle was tipped over on the second floor. Several of the surviving squatters said at least four men died.</p>
        <p>''They were burned dead,'' said Saiid Bangsu, 43, a trader of electrical wires who kept his supplies in the basement of the hotel.</p>
        <p>And so the quintessential artifact of British colonialism -- in the novel, called the Bedford Hotel, the place where bored colonial officers made a sport of cockroach-hunting -- now lies in ruin, its skeletal exterior surrounding an interior of rubble and charred wood.</p>
        <p>Only the Hill Station Club rivals the City in its devastated grandeur. That ramshackle former preserve of the colonial elite still -- incongruously -- serves drinks and offers views of the sun setting on Freetown's laterite foothills.</p>
        <p>But in a city ravaged by war, life continues, surreally somehow, around the City Hotel's corpse. Peddlers hawking cigarettes, drinks and shoes mill around the entrance for guests who will never come.</p>
        <p>Omaru Dalhatu is a money changer, a Hausa from northern Nigeria. He came to Sierra Leone in 1969, gravitating to the still lively City Hotel. He sold furniture, masks, wood carvings, and at one point had saved up the equivalent of $13,000. Then, after losing much of it in the rebellion, when his house was invaded and burned, he turned to a task for which the Hausas are famous in West Africa: changing foreign currency on the black market.</p>
        <p>He was sitting inside a shack in the hotel courtyard on a recent morning under a dead orange tree. ''If you came here on a Saturday, you could meet many, many white men,'' he said. ''This was a big place. You could meet more than 100 white men on a Saturday.''</p>
        <p>A small lizard scurried across the courtyard. Graffiti on a side wall, written in krio, the local pidgin English, warned anyone against urinating in the courtyard.</p>
        <p>''Greene's room was there,'' the money changer pointed up to a second-floor room on the hotel's front left corner.</p>
        <p>At once drawn and repelled by West Africa, the British author came to Sierra Leone several times, first as a young man who wrote ''Journey Without Maps.'' During World War II, he was assigned here as a secret agent, with duties focused on intercepting Portuguese ships that smuggled diamonds from Africa to Germany.</p>
        <p>Those years in Freetown yielded ''The Heart of the Matter,'' which describes the pettiness of colonial life and the personal fall of a deputy police commissioner named Scobie.</p>
        <p>What is surprising is how little things have changed here since the novel was published half a century ago, and Sierra Leone's independence four decades ago. After the British left, an elite class of freed slaves who founded Freetown ruled the country in concert with Lebanese settlers.</p>
        <p>Diamonds, as in the past, continue to set the rhythm of political and commercial life, drawing shady dealers from Europe, the United States and Israel, as well as Africans who hoped to make it big, like Mr. Dalhatu.</p>
        <p>Back in the late 1960's, Mr. Dalhatu, now 55, was living in the northern Nigerian city of Zaria. Other Nigerians, returning from Sierra Leone, brought back stories of easy money.</p>
        <p>''So I came here to make money quickly with diamonds,'' Mr. Dalhatu recalled. ''But when I came here, I don't see no diamonds. Only the government officials and the Lebanese, who control all the economy of this country.''</p>
        <p>Some people would venture into the mining areas and pan for diamonds. But that was illegal, and Mr. Dalhatu heard that men doing that had been shot on sight. So he stayed in Freetown, setting up shop at the City Hotel in 1969.</p>
        <p>For years, business was good -- good enough. At the hotel, he became friends with foreigners, including Peace Corps volunteers before the program was canceled in Sierra Leone.</p>
        <p>But things began going bad in the early 1990's, after a man named Foday Sankoh took up arms from neighboring Liberia. Mr. Sankoh, a cashiered corporal from the Sierra Leone Army and a failed commercial photographer, contended that there had been no improvement in the lives of most Sierra Leoneans from the misrule of the Freetown elite.</p>
        <p>The dilapidated hotel took an irreversible turn toward the worse when its longtime owner, a Swiss, died in 1992, the money changer said. The white men left for good, he said, and the hotel became a hangout for prostitutes before finally being abandoned.</p>
        <p>Then the money changer's private life unraveled.</p>
        <p>''I loved her -- that's why I married her, because I loved her,'' he recalled as he led a stranger through a window into the ruined interior of the City Hotel. ''So I kept her in my house. And why did she go to another man's house? That's not right.''</p>
        <p>The gutted kitchen overlooked the remains of the basement bar, where Greene's tired men drank pink gins.</p>
        <p>''We went to court,'' the money changer went on. ''She said she wanted the boy. I told her to take the boy, and I took the three girls. But when the boy turned 19, he came back to his father.''</p>
        <p>The floor of the lobby had collapsed. Rubble, mixed with the clothes and other supplies the traders had stockpiled in the basement, lay beyond scavenging.</p>
        <p>''I've sent two of the children to Zaria. I will return eventually with the other two.''</p>
        <p>The money changer pointed to the ceiling and the second floor, which had collapsed.</p>
        <p>''This was a big place,'' he said. But he had mixed feelings toward the British, who ruled both Sierra Leone and Nigeria. He said he did not understand Sierra Leoneans who were begging the British to stay. As an African, he said he was ashamed. ''I don't think the British were very good. British rule did not make this country important.''</p>
        <p>''You go to northern Nigeria,'' the money changer said of his home region, which the British succeeded in ruling only indirectly through local leaders. ''A Hausa man will never depend on a white man. He will depend on himself. But here it's different. It's laziness.''</p>
        <p>It was only noon, but the money changer looked tired. He swore he would not die in Sierra Leone. ''I will not stay here,'' he said. ''I will take all of my children back to my people.''</p>
