        <p>In a transaction that will create the world's most profitable food company, Philip Morris, the parent of Kraft Foods, announced yesterday that it would buy Nabisco Holdings, the food company that makes and markets Oreo cookies, Ritz Crackers and other classic American packaged foods, for $14.9 billion.</p>
        <p>In addition, Nabisco Group Holdings, the parent of Nabisco Holdings, said that once it completes the sale of its food business to Philip Morris, what remains of the company -- some $11.8 billion in cash -- will be sold to the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company for $9.8 billion.</p>

        <p>In a transaction that will create the world's most profitable food company, Philip Morris, the parent of Kraft Foods, announced yesterday that it would buy Nabisco Holdings, the food company that makes and markets Oreo cookies, Ritz Crackers and other classic American packaged foods, for $14.9 billion.</p>
        <p>In addition, Nabisco Group Holdings, the parent of Nabisco Holdings, said that once it completes the sale of its food business to Philip Morris, what remains of the company -- some $11.8 billion in cash -- will be sold to the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company for $9.8 billion.</p>
        <p>Nabisco and R. J. Reynolds had been combined until about a year ago. The pending deal means R. J. Reynolds will assume any liability from tobacco lawsuits that Nabisco Group might have had.</p>
        <p>The two sales culminate a long running effort by Carl C. Icahn, Nabisco's biggest shareholder, to boost the value of his investment. And the deal continues the wave of consolidation that has been sweeping through the $450 billion food industry.</p>
        <p>Geoffrey C. Bible, chairman and chief executive of Philip Morris, maintained that the new food company would benefit consumers and store owners alike.</p>
        <p>''Scale gives you great capability,'' Mr. Bible said in an interview yesterday. ''It allows you to be more efficient with retailers, and provides a greater capability to bring new products to market. The bigger you are, the better you are at delivering what the customer and the consumer wants.''</p>
        <p>Under the terms of the two transactions, Philip Morris will pay $55 a share in cash and assume $4 billion in Nabisco debt, while Reynolds will pay $30 a share for Nabisco Group Holdings stock.</p>
        <p>Philip Morris said it expected the acquisition of Nabisco Holdings to add to its earnings by 2002. The company, which will have 117,000 employees in its food operations once the transaction is completed, said it plans to save more than $400 million in 2002 and about $600 million by 2003, although it declined to say whether staff cuts would be required to produce those savings.</p>
        <p>The new company will keep the name Kraft Foods and will be based in Northfield, Ill.</p>
        <p>Despite the scope of a combination that will unite Nabisco with Kraft Foods, Philip Morris's food subsidiary, analysts said there was little likelihood that the deal would create much of a stir with federal regulators because the food industry remains relatively fragmented.</p>
        <p>Still, there is no question that the new company will be big. Added together, Kraft and Nabisco had revenue in 1999 of $34.9 billion, and operating profits of $5.5 billion.</p>
        <p>In terms of revenue and operating profits, ''the combined food company is bigger than H. J. Heinz, Campbell Soup, Quaker Oats, Hershey Foods and Kellogg put together,'' said John O'Neil, a food industry analyst at  Paine Webber.</p>
        <p>The deal will bring an astonishing array of well-known brands under one roof.</p>
        <p>Kraft's products include General Foods and Maxwell House coffees, Post Cereals, Philadelphia Cream Cheese, Jello, Kool Aid and Tang.</p>
        <p>In addition to Oreo and Ritz Crackers, Nabisco makes a broad array of other snack foods, including Chips Ahoy! Cookies, Planters Nuts and LifeSavers candy.</p>
        <p>The deal enables Philip Morris to remain the No. 2 food company in revenue, behind Nestle. Philip Morris would have been overtaken by Unilever, which is in the process of acquiring Bestfoods.</p>
        <p>Because Philip Morris is so large, Wall Street analysts had been predicting that it would be the likely winner in what was a tightly controlled auction of Nabisco. Indeed, while the names of many other potential bidders surfaced while Nabisco's food business was on the block, only one other group, a consortium of Danone S. A. and Cadbury Schweppes P.L.C., actually submitted an offer.</p>
        <p>''It builds a powerful domestic company,'' said John McMillin, a food industry analyst at Prudential Securities.</p>
        <p>Burt Flickinger 3rd, a managing director of Reach Marketing, a retail consulting firm based in Westport, Conn., called the purchase by Philip Morris ''a superb strategic acquisition.''</p>
        <p>''Kraft's biggest issue is having too many products that are in categories, like cheese, with declining consumption,'' he said. ''Nabisco is in one of the few fast-growing, expandable areas: cookies, crackers and salted snacks.''</p>
        <p>Analysts have been saying for more than a year that the packaged food industry should consolidate to keep pace with combinations that have been taking place among food retailers. More deals are likely to take place, as the fight to maintain shelf space intensifies.</p>
        <p>''With food retailers growing to mammoth proportions every consumer products company in the range of $3 billion to $10 billion is too small, and will be absorbed or merged,'' Mr. Flickinger said.</p>
        <p>Philip Morris also said yesterday that it planned to sell part of its Kraft Foods business to the public, probably by early next year, to pay off debt from the Nabisco purchase.</p>
        <p>''I think it will create an opportunity for shareholders to participate in the most profitable food company in the world,'' Mr. Bible said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Icahn, who bought shares in Nabisco Group from early December through February at prices from $8.75 to $11.75 a share, and who made the first tender offer for the holding company in March at $13 a share, stands to profit handsomely.</p>
        <p>Reached by telephone yesterday,  Mr. Icahn said: ''I think this is a good deal. I wouldn't have gone any higher.''</p>
        <p>After the sale of Nabisco Holdings is completed, which Philip Morris said it expected by October, Nabisco Holdings will probably wind up holding far less cash than the $11.8 billion it will have immediately after the deal with Philip Morris.</p>
        <p>Martin Feldman, a tobacco industry analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, said that once it had paid its investment bankers and lawyers and dealt with other costs, Nabisco Group Holdings will have about $1.5 billion in cash.</p>
        <p>Andrew J. Schindler, chairman and chief executive of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings, parent of the tobacco company, said, ''The acquisition provides additional opportunities to enhance shareholder value, further strengthen our balance sheet and invest in our business.''</p>
        <p>In a report to clients published earlier this year, Jaine I. Mehring, a food industry analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, estimated that a Kraft-Nabisco combination would generate about $245 million in savings.</p>
        <p>''If they think there are $400 million to $600 million in synergies, they bought this at a very good price,'' Ms. Mehring said.</p>
        <p>For its part, Nabisco made a point of noting how well its shareholders are making out.</p>
        <p>Since late March, when Mr. Icahn made his first bid, to the closing prices Philip Morris and R. J. Reynolds agreed to pay, the price of the food company's stock has increased by 101 percent. The price of Nabisco Group Holdings, the parent, is up 221 percent, at $25.5625.</p>
        <p>''This transaction provides extraordinary value for shareholders,'' James. M. Kilts, Nabisco's president and chief executive said in a statement.</p>
