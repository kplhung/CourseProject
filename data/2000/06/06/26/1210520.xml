        <p>PERHAPS no part of biotechnology has been as controversial as the movement toward patenting human cells -- parts of genes and their uses, and the techniques involved in replicating them, known as cloning.</p>
        <p>While cloning a human being remains largely the stuff of science fiction, scientists continue to develop techniques that might one day make it viable. Last week, a Wisconsin company won a patent that it says overcomes a critical obstacle in cloning mammal cells.</p>
        <p>The company, Infigen Inc. in DeForest, Wis., owns a large herd of cloned cattle that produce genetically engineered milk proteins used in drug research, and it says it plans to use the patent to further that production and related research to clone more cattle. Nevertheless, the patent is broad enough to include the cloning of human cells.</p>
        <p>''It covers all mammals,'' repeated Dr. Michael Bishop, president of Infigen, when asked about the implications for people. He explained, choosing his words carefully. ''In the debate about human cloning, for whatever reason you might want to clone cells to create opportunities for cellular therapies, this technique would cover that involving human cells.''</p>
        <p>Patent law stipulates that nothing found in nature is patentable, and that includes human beings. But in 1980, the Supreme Court upheld the legality of patents on life forms as long as they are ''made by the hand of man.'' Now the Patent and Trademark Office grants patents for isolated, purified organisms like those created by Infigen.</p>
        <p>The Infigen patent protects the steps involved in activating an unfertilized egg that has been implanted with a cell nucleus, so that the egg is prompted to divide and grow. First, the egg's own cell nucleus is removed. It is replaced with the nucleus of the donor cell, which acts to fertilize the egg with an exact copy of its genetic information. Thus, a clone of the cell donor is created.</p>
        <p>Infigen is hardly the first company to obtain a patent that could be related to human genetic engineering. Last January, the British government awarded what appeared to be the first patent for cloning humans. The patent went to an American company that has licensed the cloning techniques of transferring cell nuclei that led to the creation of Dolly, the first cloned sheep.</p>
        <p>More importantly, the new British patent covers products resulting from the technique -- whether animal or human. Since the technology can be used to create human embryos in the blastocyst stage, when they consist of a thin strand of stem cells that could theoretically grow into a baby, the patent covers human cloning. The same company has a patent pending in the United States, though officials have said their American application does not include human embryo material.</p>
        <p>In December 1999, the European Patent Office issued a patent to the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, for ''a method of preparing a transgenic animal.'' Opponents immediately pointed out that ''animal'' could include a human. The patent generated so much criticism that the European agency said it had been issued by mistake because it did not exclude human tissue from the claims. In July, a new European Union law will ban ''processes that would change the genetic identity of human organisms'' and may revoke the patent.</p>
        <p>Under United States law, if an invention is not something found in nature, then the patent office examiner has only to hold it up to the same test required of every application -- whether it is new, useful, nonobvious and fully described in the patent application. The patent might cover a technique necessary to clone humans, but it does not cover a cloned human being.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, such patents make many people nervous. Since patents confer on their owner the right to stop anyone else from making, using or selling an invention for 20 years from the date of the patent's application, many people believe that parts of the human body should be ineligible regardless of how they might be created. Private companies racing to map the human genome have been criticized for patenting their discoveries. President Clinton has urged that genome research be publicly available, and Congress has debated banning cloning.</p>
        <p>In cloning, scientists isolate a cell nucleus containing all of the genetic programming necessary for the cell to function and introduce it into an egg. Transferring this information-packed nucleus into a egg is a first step; triggering the unfertilized egg to grow into a healthy animal is more complex.</p>
        <p>''This is fundamental to the whole process of cloning,'' explained Dr. Bishop, a molecular geneticist and cell biologist, of his company's newest patent. ''After you've taken the cell and put it into the egg, you have to be able to kick start the egg into dividing and growing into an embryo.''</p>
        <p>In normal fertilization, sperm cell proteins trigger the egg to divide. The Infigen patent mimics that process with a spike in calcium levels that activates the proteins, Dr. Bishop said.</p>
        <p>''You can get the process of activation through a chemical process, or with an electrical pulse, you might get it with heat, or by cooling,'' he continued. ''The patent covers all that.''</p>
        <p>The patent also continues a series of patents originally filed in 1993, which Dr. Bishop says explains why his company was awarded a patent for a technique that follows natural sperm fertilization.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't so obvious eight years ago, back when this was first developed,'' he explained. ''This patent blocks everyone else from the activation step in the cloning process.''</p>
        <p>That is one of the criticisms leveled at the biotechnology industry -- that companies owning basic gene or other patents will inhibit the work of fellow scientists. Another is that science shouldn't be owned like property. Dr. Bishop disagreed.</p>
        <p>''We've been working on this technique since the early 1980's, and have spent several million dollars in developing it in the field of cattle and farm animals,'' he said. ''We're entitled to what we've discovered, from what we've invested in money, minds and resources. I'll leave the debate for a later venue.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Bishop said Infigen holds ''17 patents related to cloning, but this is the most dominant one.'' The company also has 7 cloning patents pending. Dr. Bishop, Joan Susko-Parrish, David Northey, M. Lorraine Leibfried-Rutledge and Steven Stice received patent 6,077,710.</p>
