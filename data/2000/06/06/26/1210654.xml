        <p>Today workers outnumber retirees and the workers' taxes pay the retirees' benefits. But tomorrow, when retirees far outnumber workers, the Social Security system will need infusions from Treasury or a tax increase to pay benefits.</p>
        <p>Thus, the central domestic issue of the 2000 presidential campaign seems to boil down to this: What do we do now to make sure government will help support tomorrow's old folks?</p>
        <p>But boil it down further: Who will be an old folk? The answer to that unasked question is the key to what alarmists label ''saving Social Security.''</p>
        <p>Give both George Bush and Al Gore credit for daring to touch what used to be called ''the third rail of American politics.'' Their differing approaches offer voters a clear political choice unrelated to personality.</p>
        <p>Bush's plan calls for taking one-sixth of the present payroll tax and allowing workers to invest it in mutual funds in individual accounts. The intent is to get a return on that investment that is higher than the present rate; that equity growth would supplement the Social Security benefit decades from now.</p>
        <p>Gore found he could not get away with labeling that ''a risky scheme'' because more than half of Americans are now stock market investors and know that in the long run, broad indexes do better than risk-free bonds.</p>
        <p>That drove him to come up with his own plan to supplement Social Security with an individual savings account for low-income workers. Gore would have government encourage them to save a little each year by adding matching funds, similar to the corporate match of 401(k) plans. For the lowest-income worker, government would add three dollars for every one saved.</p>
        <p>As you would expect, economists for both candidates are busily trashing the other guy's plan. Bush's conservative team derides the Gore plan as another government handout to redistribute income, while Gore's liberal advocates downmouth the Bush proposal as a dire threat to future Social Security benefits.</p>
        <p>Far be it from me to appear even-handed, but if the economy continues to generate trillions in surpluses - that is, if the good times roll on and on as far as the eye can squint - there is merit in both approaches. Let Bush's middle-class workers get the benefit of long-range stock growth, and let Gore's working poor have their sayings enhanced; that way, everybody's nest egg would be tax-deferred to allow the buildup of different degrees of financial security for all.</p>
        <p>Such a consensus is forming. But this nagging doubt remains: What if the good times don't continuously roll? What if we are as mistaken about eternal surpluses as we so recently were about eternal deficits?</p>
        <p>This is where the need appears to define on ''old folk.'' In 1935, when Social Security was luanched, life expectancy was in the mid-sixties. Pegging the retirement age at 65 was shrewd; it meant that not too many people would live to collect benefits for long.</p>
        <p>But now American life expectancy is nearing the mid-seventies. That blessing means that more of us will be around many more years collecting our benefits. The system was not built for such good news.</p>
        <p>Here's the message deemed too third-railly to touch: if we want to maintain Social Security benefits without raising taxes or raiding the Treasury, we are going to have to index retirement age to longevity.</p>
        <p>Not for workers about to retire; that would be denying legitimate expectations. But a worker now under 50 should be assured of full benefits when he retires at 72, or if great advances are made in curing heart disease and cancer, older than that.</p>
        <p>What about the desire of many, after a lifetime of hard work, to go fishing or just loaf around? Brain scientists tell us that's the road to degeneration and dulling of senses. Instead of early retirement, workers should be planning second careers, corporate executives creating plans to better utilize older workers, politicians thinking of incentives to keep workers' minds and bodies active and productive.</p>
        <p>As our lives inexorably lengthen, the way not to lose our marbles is to keep using them. Indexing the retirement age to longevity will help ensure financial security with mental acuity. It has to be part of the reform mix.</p>
