        <p>A gathering of just over one hundred nations that are either democracies or meet a loose definition of aspiring to be, opened here tonight in the splendor of this city's ancient royal castle. But the grit and sacrifice of modern democratic struggles were in the forefront of many delegates' minds.</p>
        <p>The nations, representing various threads of democratic rule, assembled to issue a pledge to uphold basic democratic principles. They range from tiny Mali, the African country chosen as a model for a continent largely bereft of democratic ways, to India, the world's most populous democracy, to the United States, the prime mover of the conference.</p>
        <p>The document they plan to issue, to be known as the Warsaw Declaration, will stipulate elements of democracy: free and fair elections; the rule of law; freedom of religion and the press; freedom from torture or arbitrary arrest and the right of opposition parties and trade unions to organize.</p>
        <p>The organizers -- the United States, Poland, India, Mali, Portugal, South Korea and the Czech Republic -- say they hope that the declaration will gain the currency of the Helsinki Declaration of 1975. From a start fraught with skepticism, that declaration has helped move human rights from an internal matter for individual nations to a global issue.</p>
        <p>Whether that goal will be realized here remained an open question. Unlike many international groupings, this group does not plan to establish any institutional machinery to monitor progress or penalize laggards.</p>
        <p>Rather, organizing officials hope to form an assembly of the willing whose members will promote cooperation to strengthen democracy in places where it is struggling to grow or in danger of being extinguished. They also hope that the conference, which is to convene again in Seoul in 2002, will gain enough muscle that some of those excluded this time will try to make enough progress to be invited then.</p>
        <p>In a symbolic gesture intended to set the tone, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright spoke today in Gdansk, the birthplace of the Solidarity movement, which helped topple Communism in Poland and opened the way to a flourishing democracy.</p>
        <p>''While democracy in the long run is the most stable form of government, in the short run, it is among the most fragile,'' Dr. Albright said in a speech at Gdansk University.</p>
        <p>''Good democracies, like good neighbors, can help and strengthen each other by showing solidarity, sharing knowledge, and providing concrete assistance whether in good times or bad,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The guest list for the conference, as well as the composition of the seven-member convening committee, has stirred as much interest as the content of the program -- involving about 70 foreign ministers.</p>
        <p>American officials have gone out of their way to insist that the conference is not a made-in-America affair, although the plan was hatched by Morton H. Halperin, the State Department's chief of policy planning, and taken up with the Polish foreign minister, Bronislaw Geremek, at the NATO summit meeting in Washington last year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Geremek, a dissident under Polish Communism, agreed that Poland would be the host.</p>
        <p>The assistant secretary of state for human rights, Harold H. Koh, said that concocting the invitation list was something akin to organizing a large wedding with seven sets of parents.</p>
        <p>But in the end, he said, ''I'm not someone who believes that you judge the quality of the wedding by who is or is not attending.''</p>
        <p>Among those not invited were Iran, even though it recently held elections; the countries of Central Asia, although several have made progress toward freeing their economies; Taiwan, because it is not a member of the United Nations, and many countries of Southeast Asia.</p>
        <p>There was never any question of inviting China or Saudi Arabia, the organizers said.</p>
        <p>There was considerable discussion on Iran, but an official said it was excluded because of the current summary espionage trial of 13 Jews. Further, Iran remains on the State Department's list of nations that sponsor terrorism.</p>
        <p>The conference drew some opposition from Russia, which took offense that China, Belarus and Serbia were excluded. The Russian foreign minister, Igor S. Ivanov, is staying away and will be represented by a relatively junior minister.</p>
        <p>Among the well-established democracies, attitudes toward the conference have ranged from the relative enthusiasm of Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer of Germany to pained tolerance from France, Britain and Australia, organizing officials said. The British foreign secretary, Robin Cook, decided at the last moment to stay at home and monitor the election results in Zimbabwe, a former British colony that was not invited.</p>
        <p>In Africa, Kenya, a country that the United States has traditionally supported, was included in the guest list despite widespread corruption and human rights abuses.</p>
        <p>One purpose of the conference will be to discuss how to stop democracy from backsliding.</p>
        <p>Austria, which is being ostracized by some European neighbors after including the rightist Freedom Party of Jorg Haider in the government, will be here. But officials said Austria may well be used as an example of how to support those within a society who work for democracy while showing displeasure with those who work against it.</p>
