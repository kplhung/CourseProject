        <p>Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, a leftist opposition presidential candidate, today harshly spurned an offer from the leading opposition contender, Vicente Fox Quesada, to make a last-minute campaign alliance.</p>
        <p>The exchange between the two opposition leaders, coming just one week before the vote, put a blunt end to rife speculation that they might help each other to defeat the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has held power for 71 years.

        <p>Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, a leftist opposition presidential candidate, today harshly spurned an offer from the leading opposition contender, Vicente Fox Quesada, to make a last-minute campaign alliance.</p>
        <p>The exchange between the two opposition leaders, coming just one week before the vote, put a blunt end to rife speculation that they might help each other to defeat the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has held power for 71 years. It also complicates Mr. Fox's drive to pick up new voters in the remaining days before the election next Sunday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cardenas ridiculed the offer by Mr. Fox to share in a transition government and hurled insults at him, calling him an ''electoral criminal'' and a liar and questioning his patriotism.</p>
        <p>At least four polls published in recent days indicated that Mr. Fox was locked in a tie with the candidate of the governing party, Francisco Labastida Ochoa, and that Mr. Cardenas was trailing well behind. In a poll by the newspaper Reforma on Thursday, Mr. Labastida was favored by 34 percent of those polled  and Mr. Fox by 32 percent, while Mr. Cardenas had 13 percent and 19 percent were undecided.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox extended his offer in a huge rally at dusk on Saturday in Mexico City's enormous central square. With the plaza filled and the chanting crowd spilling into the side streets, he declared: ''You must understand, Cuauhtemoc, joining forces is better for the country and for your followers. We will share the government and the responsibility for the transition.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox acknowledged more plainly than he has before that the divided opposition vote helped the governing party's chances for victory.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cardenas responded today at a slightly smaller but equally fervent rally of his left-of-center Party of the Democratic Revolution. Drawing on a spate of Mexican news reports that Mr. Fox has denied, Mr. Cardenas accused his rival of taking illegal foreign campaign donations. He said his politics and personality were ''diametrically opposed'' to those of Mr. Fox, who he said represents ''the privileged elites against the people.''</p>
        <p>Dismissing the polls, Mr. Cardenas told his followers repeatedly that he was about to win the race, belittling Mr. Fox's appeal as ''the pitiful cry of someone who knows he already lost.'' His words fell on willing ears, as many in the crowd said in interviews that they did not know that Mr. Cardenas was behind or that they did not believe the polls.</p>
        <p>In state and local races across Mexico, the governing party has continued to win, even though a majority votes against it, because the opposition splits. Surveys indicate that a majority of Mexicans want a change from the governing party, which has a history of corruption and economic mismanagement.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cardenas's speech marked a new hardening of the differences between his group and Mr. Fox's right-of-center National Action Party. Last year the two sides made progress in talks aimed at forging a united campaign, but they could not agree on a single candidate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox has attracted the backing of prominent left-leaning intellectuals and politicians once allied with Mr. Cardenas, who is making his third run for the presidency. They have appealed to Mr. Cardenas's supporters to vote for Mr. Fox without breaking with their party, in order to oust the governing party.</p>
        <p>The idea of backing Mr. Fox was clearly unpopular with Mr. Cardenas's supporters, who jeered every time Mr. Fox's name was mentioned.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cardenas said Mr. Fox, through envoys, had offered him two cabinet posts, director of the state petroleum company and secretary of energy, in a transition government. Both Martha Sahagun, Mr. Fox's spokeswoman, and Jorge Castaneda, an intellectual who recently joined Mr. Fox's campaign, denied that any such offer had been made.</p>
        <p>''I have said that there is nothing to be gained by any sort of secret tender to Cuauhtemoc, because it's a waste of time,'' Mr. Castaneda said.</p>
