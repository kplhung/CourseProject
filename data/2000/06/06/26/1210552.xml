        <p>Freshly stung by their 1998 election losses, House Republicans vowed one thing as the reality of their defeat sunk in: they would learn from their mistakes.</p>
        <p>In no time, the speaker was ousted and another took the helm. The new  strategy was relatively simple: the Republicans would deflect the label of a ''do nothing Congress'' and satisfy their core voters by passing small tax cuts -- the same bills President Clinton vetoed as part of a giant package last year.</p>
        <p>So far, the tax cuts for older people, married couples, farmers and families inheriting large estates have sailed through the House, drawing large swaths of Democrats with them. The Republicans also pledged to move the contentious spending bills early in the year. And with the China trade vote under their belt, the Republicans could point to yet another accomplishment.</p>
        <p>But now, with the Fourth of July recess approaching and the clock ticking loudly, House Republicans face a number of sensitive issues -- most of them trumpeted by Democrats -- that could undermine their strategy and possibly hurt them in the elections this fall. They hold the majority by a mere five votes.</p>
        <p>Waiting in the wings are bills to provide affordable prescription drugs to elderly people, help patients obtain better treatment from health maintenance organizations, raise the minimum wage, overhaul the campaign finance system, toughen gun control and help schools. Most of the bills involve issues that voters in public opinion surveys mention as important to them.</p>
        <p>The Democrats, who view these as their issues, are firmly united on their agenda in a way they have seldom been. With every passing day, they have ratcheted up the oratory, hoping to portray Republicans as ineffective once again, this time on the things voters really care about. On prescription drugs, for example, Mr. Clinton last week proposed doubling the size of his plan to provide expanded insurance coverage for Medicare beneficiaries.</p>
        <p>Even if the Republicans push through legislation intended to address these issues, Democrats say any proposal that lacks an element of bipartisan compromise will be vetoed, and voters will not see any benefits from all the politicking.</p>
        <p>''They don't want to do any of it,'' Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, said of the Republicans on Friday. ''They realize it's popular. Their pollsters tell them, 'This is popular, and you ought to act like you're interested.' So they run out and act like they're interested.</p>
        <p>''They don't want to do anything,'' he added. ''They want to do nothing.''</p>
        <p>There it is: do nothing.</p>
        <p>''The initial approach was purely minimalist in form,'' said Representative Mark Sanford, a Republican from South Carolina who is not seeking re-election. ''We will do the absolute minimum, which is passing the authorizing and appropriations bills, and maybe a few bite-sized morsels that appeal to conservatives and get out of town.</p>
        <p>''But now things like prescription drugs have popped up, and it's no longer, 'Pass the appropriations bills and get out of town,' '' Mr. Sanford added. ''We have to go on offense.''</p>
        <p>For now, the Republican game plan basically remains the same: come up with a bill, pass it out of the House -- with or without the Democrats -- and hope that that is enough to please voters. It is a kind of blending of their 1996 and 1998 strategies.</p>
        <p>In 1996, still smarting from the beating they took after partly shutting down the government, the Republicans compromised on a flurry of important measures that the president signed into law.</p>
        <p>In 1998, the Republicans did not put forward any cohesive agenda, hoping the pending impeachment of Mr. Clinton would carry them to victory. Then, at the end of the session, the president rolled over them, filling the spending bills with all kinds of items wanted by the Democrats.</p>
        <p>''We can't be held hostage to the point where we are so desperate to get a bill that we will give up anything and surrender,'' said Representative Thomas M. Davis III of Virginia, who is chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee.</p>
        <p>At the moment, the prescription drug issue is the most pressing. Republicans came up with their own legislation to help make prescription drugs more affordable to the elderly.</p>
        <p>One of the Republicans' own pollsters sent them a report making it clear that the Democrats held an advantage on this issue and that the Republicans had to react, even if they were just paying lip service on the need for legislation.</p>
        <p>But Republicans say they are sincere in their desire for action on the  issue. They say they are just not willing to go as far as Democrats, who want to make prescription drugs  universal for all Medicare beneficiaries, a more costly proposition.</p>
        <p>The point is, Republicans say, they have a bill, which was approved last Wednesday in a party-line vote by the House Ways and Means Committee. Republican leaders say they hope the full House will vote on it soon. And if there is a compromise, fine. If not, that is fine, too.</p>
        <p>It is also fine for the Democrats, who view it as a win-win proposition, either way. They can take credit for putting the prescription drug issue on the agenda or accuse Republicans of failing to compromise.</p>
        <p>''They've been dragged kicking and screaming to these issues,'' said Representative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut.</p>
        <p>The script is the same on other issues, too. House Republicans passed a managed care proposal, put forward by Democrats, despite the leadership's objections. This, they hoped, inoculated them against criticism on the campaign trail.</p>
        <p>But the bill has been stymied in negotiations with the Senate, and it is questionable whether a compromise will ever be worked out, although Republicans are still counting on it. ''I think there is going to be a wake-up call to the senators,'' said Representative Mark Foley, Republican of Florida.</p>
        <p>There again, Democrats hope to say Republicans killed the bill.</p>
        <p>Minimum wage is also trapped in negotiations with the Senate. And Congress has done very little on education issues this year. Indeed, Republicans were unable to pass a measure to reauthorize spending on education.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the yearly headaches over the spending bills -- on which Republicans, true to their word, have moved relatively swiftly this year -- also loom.</p>
        <p>But the Republicans hope that voters see the Democrats' hardball tactics as political moves meant to put obstacles in their way. ''The Democrats have one strategy: to not let us pass anything,'' Mr. Davis said.</p>
        <p>The wild card in all of this is the presidential race. House Republicans are buoyed by the latest poll numbers showing Gov. George W. Bush of Texas ahead of Vice President Al Gore.</p>
        <p>''People are not willing to burn the House down in an election year the way maybe some of us would have in past years,'' said Mr. Sanford, one of a clutch of rebellious conservatives who have mellowed a bit with age.</p>
        <p>''This is not a climate where people want a lot of change,'' Mr. Davis said. ''We're in a status quo year.''</p>
