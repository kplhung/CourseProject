        <p>Eight years after thinking they had a deal to acquire the rights to Eric Lindros, the Rangers are interested in obtaining the often-injured superstar from the Philadelphia Flyers.</p>
        <p>''I talked to Eric,'' said Glen Sather, the new president and general manager of the Rangers, one of four teams with permission to talk to Lindros. ''I don't think any of the drteams that have been given permission to talk to him want to make a deal if he can't play. But if he is healthy and willing and able to play, yeah, absolutely, love to have him. I know him. I like him. I respect him.''</p>

        <p>Eight years after thinking they had a deal to acquire the rights to Eric Lindros, the Rangers are interested in obtaining the often-injured superstar from the Philadelphia Flyers.</p>
        <p>''I talked to Eric,'' said Glen Sather, the new president and general manager of the Rangers, one of four teams with permission to talk to Lindros. ''I don't think any of the drteams that have been given permission to talk to him want to make a deal if he can't play. But if he is healthy and willing and able to play, yeah, absolutely, love to have him. I know him. I like him. I respect him.''</p>
        <p>In 1992, Lindros was the property of the Quebec Nordiques, but he refused to play for them. At the National Hockey League draft that summer, the Nordiques accidentally traded Lindros to two teams on the same day.</p>
        <p>They were the Flyers and the Rangers. Although Lindros would have preferred to join the Rangers and their captain, Mark Messier, an arbitrator awarded him to the Flyers because they had negotiated for him first.</p>
        <p>After eight seasons of sporadic success, frequent injuries and a growing feud with the Philadelphia management, Lindros may be headed to New York, possibly as a teammate of Messier's. But major hurdles before such a deal can be made include an agreement with the Flyers and Lindros's recovery from a series of concussions.</p>
        <p>The other teams with permission to talk to Lindros are thought to be Toronto, Los Angeles and Dallas, which also play in major markets and have big budgets. Lindros earned $8.5 million last season. That was among the highest salaries in the N.H.L. He is set to become a restricted free agent on Saturday. The Flyers can keep rights to the player by matching any salary offer from other teams by offering Lindros the same wages for next season.</p>
        <p>Should another team sign Lindros, it would owe the Flyers five first-round draft choices, although it is unlikely that a team would do this in view of his medical history. The logical way for Philadelphia to move him would be to trade him for conditional compensation, meaning that the exchange back to the Flyers would increase in proportion to the number of games and seasons Lindros played.</p>
        <p>Lindros had four concussions this past season, the most recent in the third round of the Stanley Cup playoffs when he was checked hard by Scott Stevens of the Devils. It was only his second appearance of the tournament. Lindros is still suffering some symptoms. Of his conversation with Lindros this weekend, Sather said: ''I asked him how he felt, and he said he's feeling better every day. He told me he wants to play again,  and he wants to continue playing for as many years as possible.''</p>
        <p>As for Messier, he could become an unrestricted free agent on Saturday, unless the Vancouver Canucks pick up an option on his contract. This is thought to be unlikely because Messier is 39 years old and his talents have diminished in three seasons with Vancouver after six seasons with the Rangers. Sather is trying to rebuild the Rangers after taking over from Neil Smith. Lindros, in his youth, admired Messier. Although Lindros is 27, he could still benefit from a student-mentor relationship with Messier.</p>
        <p>The Rangers, having missed the playoffs for three consecutive seasons, could benefit from the publicity generated by the two big centers. Messier, who would get a $2 million buyout from Vancouver, might be willing to work for less than the $6 million he earned last season. Along with leading the Rangers to the Stanley Cup in 1994, Messier helped the Edmonton Oilers to five championships from 1984 through 1990 under Sather.</p>
        <p>Whatever Lindros's future is, it probably will not be in Philadelphia. Relations have become strained between Lindros and the Flyers, particularly with General Manager Bob Clarke, who has bluntly criticized Carl and Bonnie Lindros, the player's parents. Carl Lindros acts as his son's agent. When asked about Eric Lindros yesterday, Clarke said:</p>
        <p>''There is a worry about his salary. There is a worry about his head. There is a worry about his parents. It's not a small league. Everyone knows everything that is going on. It's not like there's a lineup to get him or anything. Preferably, we'd like to keep him and have him play hockey, but without the excess grief he's thrown at us. But it doesn't look like that is going to happen.''</p>
        <p>Last season with the Flyers, Lindros scored 27 goals and added 32 assists in 55 games of an 82-game schedule. In his return against the Devils, he had a goal and an assist but was injured early in his next game. In his best season with the Flyers, 1995-96, Lindros had 47 goals and 68 assists. He won the Hart trophy in 1994-1995 as the most valuable player when he scored 29 goals in 46 games in a lockout-shortened season.</p>
        <p>When Messier left the Rangers in 1997 as a free agent, the team replaced him at center with Pat LaFontaine, a veteran who was recovering from a series of concussions. LaFontaine played most of the season but had to retire before it ended after suffering another concussion, in an accidental collision with his teammate Mike Keane.</p>
