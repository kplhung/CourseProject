        <p>After a tumultuous week, Representative Rick A. Lazio headed for comfortable ground in upstate New York today, expressing little regret over his decision not to attend the gay pride parade in Manhattan in favor of courting voters on a dairy farm north of Albany and at a chamber of commerce dinner in this town a few miles northeast of Buffalo.</p>
        <p>While his Democratic opponent in the Senate race, Hillary Rodham Clinton, marched in the annual Gay and Lesbian Pride parade, Mr. Lazio admired farm animals and ate breakfast with scores of supporters as he toured a farm in West Charlton, in Saratoga County.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio suggested he had missed the parade to hew to an ambitious schedule that calls for campaigning heavily upstate -- where political analysts believe the race could be won or lost -- while balancing the demands of his Congressional duties.</p>
        <p>''You just have to make choices between a lot of invitations that you get,'' said Mr. Lazio, who said he had generally supported legislation backed by gay rights advocates, including financing for AIDS programs, though some describe his record as mixed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio had been criticized by Mrs. Clinton, gay rights advocates and even some Republicans last week for his decision to miss the parade, which organizers had hoped he would attend to demonstrate tolerance. Republicans nationwide have recently made overtures to the gay groups to affirm their support for diversity.</p>
        <p>The parade controversy came during a week in which Mr. Lazio faced new attack ads by Mrs. Clinton and in which he confirmed that the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating whether his windfall profit three years ago in the stock of a company controlled by his campaign contributors had resulted from inside information.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio soldiered on, however, and those issues came up only when they were raised by reporters at his two stops.</p>
        <p>On his visit to the farm, Mr. Lazio highlighted his promise to search for ways to stabilize milk prices. He supports federal legislation to allow New York to join the Northeast Dairy Compact, a milk-price-fixing arrangement among six New England states that farmers say will bring them more money.</p>
        <p>''The value of being here is gaining an understanding of the issues that affect farmers, dairy farmers in particular,'' Mr. Lazio said.</p>
        <p>Later, he attended the Amherst Chamber of Commerce reception in Getzville.</p>
        <p>As he often does when campaigning upstate, he spoke of the need to fight for low taxes and focus on economic development programs that would spread prosperity throughout New York.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio suggested that his duties in Washington, in which he has sought to be present for most votes but has missed some, left him at a disadvantage.</p>
