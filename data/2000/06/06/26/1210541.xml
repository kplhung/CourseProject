        <p>Officials at the Los Alamos National Laboratory have pressured employees to report that security at the laboratory is better than they actually believe, a new report by the Energy Department's inspector general says.</p>
        <p>Managers at the laboratory, which has been rocked by several major security breaches over the last year, appear to be more concerned about making the laboratory ''look good'' on security than in reporting real conditions, several employees told the inspector general.</p>
        <p>About 30 percent of the security operations personnel at the laboratory interviewed by the inspector general, the report said, believed they had been pressured to alter their responses on periodic surveys of Los Alamos security conducted by the Energy Department. The management pressure on employees was designed to improve the laboratory's security ratings, the inspector general found.</p>
        <p>The inspector general's report, issued May 30, concluded that the security evaluation system used at Los Alamos has ''raised legitimate concerns that the overall security condition at the laboratory was not being accurately reported.''</p>
        <p>The report, which has previously received little attention, offered a prescient warning of the latest security crisis involving the strange case of nuclear lost and found at the New Mexico laboratory.</p>
        <p>Just days after the inspector general's report was released, the public disclosure that two computer hard drives containing nuclear weapons data used by the government's Nuclear Emergency Search Team, or NEST, were missing, sparked yet another crisis at the laboratory. The loss of the hard drives -- followed by their mysterious reappearance behind a copying machine at the laboratory -- came at a time when Los Alamos had not yet recovered from last year's security crisis. That concerned accusations of Chinese nuclear espionage and the arrest of a former Los Alamos scientist, Wen Ho Lee.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lee was fired in March 1999 for security violations after he had been investigated in connection with charges of Chinese spying. After he was fired, investigators discovered that he had downloaded vast amounts of nuclear weapons data from the classified computer network at Los Alamos and copied it onto portable computer tapes, some of which are missing. He was never charged with espionage, but he was arrested in December and charged with mishandling classified information. Dr. Lee says he is innocent.</p>
        <p>Repeated security failings at the laboratory have prompted Energy Secretary Bill Richardson to try to impose tougher measures, but he has acknowledged that he is fighting an attitude among laboratory scientists of indifference and outright hostility to security regulations. The disappearance of the hard drives -- coming so soon after the Wen Ho Lee case -- has also prompted Congressional leaders to call for Mr. Richardson's resignation, and seemed to end any chances he had of becoming Vice President Al Gore's running mate on the Democratic ticket.</p>
        <p>The inspector general began its investigation into altered security ratings at Los Alamos as a result of two complaints from laboratory employees, the report said. One employee said that Los Alamos security operations division personnel were pressured to change their findings on security reports, while the second employee said that managers in the Energy Department's Albuquerque field office changed the security ratings after an Energy Department team had completed its survey of security at the laboratory.</p>
        <p>The inspector general found that laboratory management had repeatedly played down the security concerns reported in self-assessments written by laboratory employees. Investigators from the inspector general's office were told about two instances at Los Alamos in which laboratory managers became so upset with the fact that employees had mentioned certain security problems in their surveys that they reassigned the surveys to be filled out by other employees. Those new reviews by more accommodating employees found that ''there were no issues to be raised'' and gave the laboratory satisfactory security ratings as a result.</p>
        <p>The inspector general found that managers at the Albuquerque office altered the ratings for both 1998 and 1999 for Los Alamos after survey teams from Albuquerque had already assigned security ratings for the laboratory. Among other changes, the inspector general found that Albuquerque upgraded the ratings given by the survey team for ''nuclear materials control and accountability'' at Los Alamos. The Energy Department's Albuquerque field office conducts annual security surveys of Los Alamos security operations to ensure that the laboratory is in compliance with Energy Department requirements.</p>
        <p>Although the inspector general could not find evidence of collusion or deal-making between Albuquerque and Los Alamos, it reported that it also could not find any rationale used by Albuquerque management to alter the security ratings. ''Albuquerque management said that the rating process was subjective and that ratings remain fluid until a final report is issued,'' the inspector general's report stated. Yet, the inspector general said, it could find ''no documented basis to support the Albuquerque management position concerning rating assignments or changes.''</p>
