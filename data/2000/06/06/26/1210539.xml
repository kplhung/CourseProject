        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>My husband, Byron, and I met in Manhattan in 1956. He was a fencer training for the Melbourne Olympic Games and I was an actress in a production at a 57th Street theater. Two years later, we were married in New York, but his job in the Midwest forced us to abandon paradise.</p>
        <p>Some years later, when our eldest daughter, Evelyn, was a student at New York University, I went to New York for a mother-daughter visit. We were sitting in an Israeli restaurant in the Village, surrounded by walls covered with pictures of the hills of Jerusalem. The room was filled with white-covered tables and there was no dance floor, but I had the strangest feeling.</p>

        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>My husband, Byron, and I met in Manhattan in 1956. He was a fencer training for the Melbourne Olympic Games and I was an actress in a production at a 57th Street theater. Two years later, we were married in New York, but his job in the Midwest forced us to abandon paradise.</p>
        <p>Some years later, when our eldest daughter, Evelyn, was a student at New York University, I went to New York for a mother-daughter visit. We were sitting in an Israeli restaurant in the Village, surrounded by walls covered with pictures of the hills of Jerusalem. The room was filled with white-covered tables and there was no dance floor, but I had the strangest feeling.</p>
        <p>''Somehow, I know your father and I danced the tango in this room a long time ago,'' I whispered to my daughter.</p>
        <p>''Don't be ridiculous,'' my daughter replied. ''They don't even have dancing here.''</p>
        <p>I definitely felt I was in my husband's arms in a tango and I wanted to know the reason. I motioned to a waiter and asked what the restaurant was before it became Israeli.</p>
        <p>''It used to be a Spanish nightspot,'' he said. ''In fact, you are sitting on what used to be the dance floor.''</p>
        <p>If you're saying, ''That must have been some tango!'' you're right. Why do you suppose I married him?</p>

        <p>Janice Cauwels came in recently from New Jersey to the George Washington Bridge Bus Station and was heading for the subway token booth. Suddenly, a MetroCard was flashed in front of her. The woman wielding it explained that another passenger had given it to her and that it was an all-day pass that she no longer needed. Ms. Cauwels thanked her and swiped the card through the turnstile. When she arrived at the Port Authority, she gave the card to a man waiting in line and watched as he swiped it through. She's still wondering how many friends that card made during its brief life span.</p>
        <p>Setting: A West Side restaurant during a heavy rainstorm, nearing 8 p.m.</p>
        <p>In the wings: Marvin Mitchneck, who overhears two unidentified players.</p>
        <p>Player No. 1, husband: ''If we don't get going, we'll miss the show.''</p>
        <p>Player No. 2, wife: ''I don't care. These shoes are worth more than the tickets.''</p>
        <p>THEN AND NOW</p>
        <p>When first I went to Paris</p>
        <p>I was a slim size 8</p>
        <p>I tried on every pretty dress</p>
        <p>On me they all looked great.</p>
        <p>The problem was my wallet</p>
        <p>It too was thin and lean</p>
        <p>I couldn't buy a single dress,</p>
        <p>I didn't have a bean.</p>
        <p>Now when I go to Paris</p>
        <p>My wallet is quite fat</p>
        <p>But so am I, the clothes don't fit,</p>
        <p>And that, alas, is that.</p>

        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>Lois Kohn-Claar was walking Lilly, her 5-year-old daughter, to school when Lilly spotted a friend up ahead and ran to join him. As Mrs. Kohn-Claar caught up with them, she heard Lilly recounting her experience the previous day at the new Rose Center for Earth and Space at the American Museum of Natural History. Lilly obviously knew the friend had already visited there and was talking about how cool it was with the big ball on the outside and how ''when you went in the museum you were actually in the ball!''</p>
        <p>''And you could see the whole galaxy,'' the friend said.</p>
        <p>''And you could even see the whole . . . um . . . the whole . . . Tootsie Roll!'' Lilly chimed in.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kohn-Claar tried to enter a 5-year-old's mind. What was her daughter referring to that would resemble a Tootsie Roll? The light dawned.</p>
        <p>''Do you mean the Milky Way?'' she asked.</p>
        <p>''Yeah, that's it,'' Lilly said.</p>
        <p>A friend of Deborah DiSesa Hirsch's recently visited Cancun. To her delight, bagels were on the menu. She ordered one with cream cheese. Then she looked at the waiter to see if he understood. Without batting an eye, he said, ''Low fat? Or a shmeer?''</p>
        <p>Zoe Macaulay accompanied her husband, Gordon Mosher, to a 1940 class reunion weekend at Princeton last month. As their section of the annual parade was proceeding across the campus, the class received a rousing cheer from one of the more recent classes awaiting its turn to march. Ms. Macaulay heard one of the young men remark to a colleague, ''It must be great to meet a friend your own age to reminisce about the Depression.''</p>
        <p>Peter Santoro rented a car for the Memorial Day weekend, and it happened to have Pennsylvania license plates. He parked it on East 86th Street near his apartment. The next morning he went downstairs to move the car and realized he had left the window on the passenger side wide open -- a clear invitation for trouble. He then noticed a note resting on the driver's seat: It was printed in ink in block letters, and the heading read: ''Doormen 430 E. 86 St.''</p>
        <p>''NOW, WHEN YOU GO BACK TO PA YOU CAN TELL EVERYONE YOU LEFT YOUR CAR OPENED FOR 24 HOURS AND IT DIDN'T GET STOLEN. NYC. IT'S NOT THAT BAD.''</p>
        <p>Underneath was a little smiley face and the words, ''WE'RE ALWAYS WATCHING.''</p>
        <p>HOT STUFF</p>
        <p>When the smoke had finished</p>
        <p>Pouring out of my ears</p>
        <p>And the flames in my eyes</p>
        <p>Had been doused by my tears,</p>
        <p>I breathed -- though breathless --</p>
        <p>A hearty three cheers</p>
        <p>For that Indonesian chicken.</p>
        <p>When my bald spot had ceased</p>
        <p>Its empurpled shining</p>
        <p>And I had completed</p>
        <p>My volcanic dining,</p>
        <p>I telephoned Sears</p>
        <p>For a new stomach lining --</p>
        <p>Oh, that Indonesian chicken!</p>
        <p>Envoi</p>
        <p>The next time I eat</p>
        <p>Chicken Indonesia</p>
        <p>I'll be sure to precede it</p>
        <p>With local anesthesia.</p>

        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>I was on a westbound 86th Street bus when a mother and screaming child boarded. The child was having a major tantrum, screaming, ''You didn't buy me ice cream,'' and pausing only to catch his breath. Mom made no effort to try to calm him, and the screaming continued at high pitch for several blocks.</p>
        <p>Finally, a stentorian female voice from the back of the bus intoned, ''If you do NOT stop this very minute, you will NEVER, EVER have an ice cream again for as long as you live!''</p>
        <p>It worked.</p>
