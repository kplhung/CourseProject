        <p>In a move clearly intended to build support for Moscow's newly appointed administrator of Chechnya, the Russian military today declared that it had suspended airstrikes and artillery attacks in the breakaway region.</p>
        <p>The announcement came from Col. Gen. Gennadi Troshev, the senior commander of Russian forces in the region, after he met Akhmad Kadyrov, the Chechen official picked by President Vladimir V. Putin this month to govern Chechnya.</p>
        <p>''We came to the common conclusion that the war, as such, is over on the territory of Chechnya,'' General Troshev said. ''An agreement was reached that the Unified Army Group is not conducting offensive operations and not carrying out aviation or artillery strikes.''</p>
        <p>The Russian authorities have repeatedly claimed to have broken the back of the rebel resistance only to see the fighting continue and casualties climb. There was little expectation that the announcement today would end the fighting, which has claimed countless civilian casualties and left more than 2,100 Russian soldiers dead and 6,000 troops wounded since Oct. 1.</p>
        <p>As recently as Saturday, Gen. Anatoly Kvashnin, the chief of the Russian General Staff, acknowledged that Russian forces in Chechnya ''are not in full control of the situation.''</p>
        <p>In a sense, therefore, the announcement -- made in Tsentoroy, Mr. Kadyrov's hometown in Chechnya -- appeared to be the Kremlin's attempt to put the best political gloss on a military situation that has seen the Chechen rebels switch to guerrilla tactics that Russian troops find difficult to combat.</p>
        <p>In political terms, the Kremlin is trying to build support among the Chechen people for Mr. Kadyrov by providing him with an accomplishment that he could present to them: a seeming end to the air and artillery strikes that have terrified and angered the Chechen population.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kadyrov is struggling to win the allegiance of local leaders and the Chechen public. Although he opposed the Russians during the first Chechen war, fought from 1994 to 1996, he cooperated with Moscow after the Russian military intervention last September that followed an incursion by Chechen rebels into the neighboring Russian region of Dagestan, and the fatal bombings of apartment buildings in Russia that left hundreds dead.</p>
        <p>A former Muslim religious leader, Mr. Kadyrov recently resigned his post as mufti of Chechnya, a move that appeared to be intended to strengthen his credentials as a civilian leader.</p>
        <p>Though he has been promising that well-known rebel commanders would rally behind him, Aslan Maskhadov, the separatist leader and president of the breakaway republic, has labeled Mr. Kadyrov a traitor.  The newly appointed administrator has been the target of several assassination attempts.</p>
        <p>In terms of public relations, the announcement also appeared intended as a gesture to the West, which has urged Russia to curtail indiscriminate air and artillery strikes that have wounded or killed thousands of civilians.</p>
        <p>A delegation from the Council of Europe said on Saturday that it had been told by Russian generals that the fighting was winding down and that Moscow was in the process of withdrawing its troops.</p>
        <p>That delegation was led by the Italian Foreign Minister, Lamberto Dini. When the war in Chechnya was raging earlier this year, some representatives of the Council of Europe urged that Russian membership be suspended, a threat that has riled Moscow.</p>
        <p>In recent months, the rebels in Chechen have mounted guerrilla ambushes, suicide bombings and snipers. The rebels have also infiltrated Grozny, the Chechen capital, and other towns, and are drawing support from the Chechen population.</p>
        <p>The rebel attacks cannot be countered by the sheer firepower of artillery or punishing airstrikes that the Russian military used during much of the war. General Troshev's comments, in part, seemed to be an indirect acknowledgment that the conflict in Chechnya has turned into a guerrilla war.</p>
        <p>In their comments today, General Troshev and Mr. Kadyrov also suggested that the military was scaling down its operations and would keep army troops close to their bases in Chechnya instead of fanning out into the mountains and countryside. Or as Mr. Kadryov put it, ''the military should be brought closer to their bases so that they can coordinate with the Interior Ministry in the struggle against banditry.''</p>
        <p>In recent months, a series of bloody ambushes has led Russian troops to hunker down and adopt a largely defensive posture. It was clear, however, from the announcement that the Russian and Chechen leaders were not -- at least for now -- contemplating a repetition of 1996, when Russian troops retreated from Chechnya after heavy loss of life and the region became largely lawless.</p>
        <p>Even as he was announcing the apparent retrenchment of Russian forces, General Troshev suggested that the rebels would need to be destroyed before Russian military occupation could end. He did not explain how that could be done, especially given the military's defensive orientation.</p>
        <p>The Russian authorities have long planned to withdraw army units after the main rebel resistance is crushed, leaving only the army's 42d Motorized Infantry Division to keep order along with Russian Interior Ministry troops and Chechen units under Russian control. General Troshev alluded to that plan without saying when it would be carried out.</p>
        <p>''Within reasonable limits, we shall be leaving troops in the mountains, in the plateau and in the villages,'' he said. ''And Interior Ministry troops will remain for the period we consider necessary to stabilize the situation.''</p>
        <p>''Whether this happens within a month, half a year or a year is unimportant,'' he said. ''The main thing is that the faster the bandits are destroyed, the faster stabilization will come.''</p>
