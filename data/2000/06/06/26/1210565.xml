        <p>After spending most of the 20th century as a parking lot for sanitation vehicles, one of New York City's oldest and most elegant parks is about to be reborn.</p>

        <p>After spending most of the 20th century as a parking lot for sanitation vehicles, one of New York City's oldest and most elegant parks is about to be reborn.</p>
        <p>There had long been rumors in the neighborhood that the paved triangle bordered by Canal and Washington Streets and the West Side Highway had once been a park. But not until residents organized to fight plans to add lanes to Canal Street did the whole picture emerge. The narrow asphalt sliver, they learned, had been a venerable oasis with a sterling architectural pedigree. It was designed in 1870 by Samuel Parsons and later redesigned by Calvert Vaux. It flourished for generations, was illegally given away in 1930 by Robert Moses, then forgotten.</p>
        <p>Last month, faced with a lawsuit, the State Department of Transportation agreed to provide about $1 million for a rebuilt park, modeled after the original 130-year-old design.</p>
        <p>It would be the final chapter of a long story.</p>
        <p>In 1870, when the newly created Parks Department designated the lushly landscaped triangle, there were very few city parks, and most were closed to the public. But people living in claustrophobic tenements were clamoring for a bit of greenery and open space for their children.</p>
        <p>Canal Street Park was meant to be a model for other vest-pocket parks, and some of New York's most eminent architects, designers and gardeners, collaborated on it. Small as it was -- less than two-fifths of an acre -- the arrow-shaped green was thickly planted with shrubs, bulbs, greenery and precisely aligned trees. The black wrought-iron fence from City Hall Park, which had been demolished in the mid-19th century to build a new Post Office, was erected around the triangle and benches were set up inside. Years later, near the turn of the century, Vaux added an S-shaped path.</p>
        <p>The park was sacrificed in 1921, when the city lent it to the agency building the Holland Tunnel and the West Side Highway for use as a parking lot, supposedly for four years. The deadline for restoring and returning the park passed.</p>
        <p>In 1930, Robert Moses -- the commissioner famed and reviled for blanketing New York with parks and pavement -- announced that the richly landscaped green with the serpentine walkway was not needed as a park anymore. Illegally, he handed it over to the Manhattan borough president, Julius Miller.</p>
        <p>Mr. Miller seems to have had no need for the sliver, either. The sanitation department began storing snowplows and salt trucks on it.</p>
        <p>There were inklings -- ''It had a sense of place, it seemed too perfect, too geometric, to just be a parking lot,'' said Richard Barrett, a Canal Street resident. And a few people noticed that the triangle was labeled Canal Street Park on antique maps in neighborhood shops. But nobody understood the implications: it requires an act of the State Legislature before a park can be legally turned into a parking lot or anything else.</p>
        <p>''This park was crushed, obliterated,'' said Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern. ''It was taken away by Robert Moses for what they called West Side improvement, but he never did it legally. It was always parkland under the pavement; it remained legally a park. But nobody noticed until the community organized.''</p>
        <p>Last year, the residents around the western end of Canal Street formed a committee to fight the state's plans to add lanes to feed into Holland Tunnel. In the course of a year of research, they uncovered the history of the park and prepared a lawsuit to force the government to reclaim the parking lot as a park. In fighting for the park, they discovered they were following in the footsteps of neighborhood residents a century ago.</p>
        <p>''We kept finding the same names over and over -- people who had lived in these buildings who were dedicated to making the park,'' said Richard Barrett, an artist and transportation advocate who led the research effort. ''Now here we were, 100 years later, doing the same things.''</p>
        <p>The community filed the lawsuit against the city, state and federal governments last winter. The state took the lead in negotiating a settlement that was, according to Jana Haimsohn, a Canal Street resident and performance artist, ''better than we dreamed.''</p>
        <p>The state agreed to pay for the construction of a new, historically accurate park, with the serpentine walkway, a replica of the wrought-iron fence from the old City Hall Park, as well as a few additional flourishes -- a fountain, perhaps.</p>
        <p>''We've never picked up a park this way,'' said Mr. Stern. But now he says he is thinking of assigning an employee to comb antique maps, looking for other paved-over slivers of green that can be reclaimed.</p>
