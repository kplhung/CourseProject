        <p>A 6-year-old girl and her mother drowned and three other people were hospitalized last night after strong currents pushed them from Rockaway Beach in Queens more than 500 yards out into the Atlantic Ocean, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>In a separate accident, a teenager drowned in calm, clear waters off Orchard Beach in the Bronx yesterday when he and a companion apparently decided to jump out of their small rented boat and go swimming, the police said.</p>
        <p>In the Rockaways accident, three people -- the woman, 40, her daughter and her 9-year-old niece -- were swimming 20 to 40 feet off shore before being swept farther out, the authorities said. They spent more than 20 minutes bobbing in the rough waters before being rescued by New York City firefighters and the Police Department, officials said.</p>
        <p>The 6-year-old and her mother died last night at Peninsula Hospital Center on Far Rockaway. The 9-year-old was taken to St. John's Hospital in Queens, where she was in stable condition, officials said. A firefighter and a bystander who swam out to the victims were also injured in the rescue after inhaling water in the choppy seas.</p>
        <p>The incident began at 7:17 p.m. and was filled with confusion and danger as a police helicopter and two fire companies followed the drifting family members as the tide pulled them along Far Rockaway for a distance of about six blocks between the time of the 911 call and the beginning of the rescue, the officials said. They were swimming after the beach had closed and lifeguards had left for the night, at 6 p.m., said Robert Lawson, a Parks Department spokesman.</p>
        <p>The Police Department's aviation unit sent a rescue helicopter from farther east in Queens. The firefighters, armed with surfboards and motorized torpedo buoys, came from Far Rockaway. Most of the rescue personnel were on the scene within minutes, officials said.</p>
        <p>''The original location was 17th Street,'' said Capt. John Rokee of Ladder Company 134. ''By the time we got there, we were sent to 19th Street. Then members of Ladder 134 who were running to the location with surfboards found the victims near 24th Street.''</p>
        <p>The two girls were apparently swimming about 20 feet offshore when the current began pushing them southwest toward Breezy Point, Captain Rokee said. Witnesses said the woman jumped into the water and was also swept away while trying to rescue them.''It was pulling them right out into the ocean,'' Captain Rokee said.</p>
        <p>There were eight firefighters in the water, and two police divers jumped into the water from the helicopter, officials said. The first victim to be rescued was the 9-year-old, who was brought back to shore by the injured firefighter, Lt. Timmy Smith of Ladder Company 134.</p>
        <p>After the 9-year-old was brought to shore, both she and Lieutenant Smith were taken to St. John's. After being released, the lieutenant said he ''was very surprised that they were afloat.''</p>
        <p>The police divers then rescued the 6-year-old girl, who was flown to the shore and taken by ambulance to Peninsula Hospital, officials said. Her mother was the last victim pulled from the water. The authorities said that the divers pulled her into the helicopter and flew her directly to Peninsula.</p>
        <p>Pat Kernan, a spokeswoman for Peninsula Hospital, said doctors worked for two and a half hours to try to revive the 6-year-old and her mother. They died at about 10:30 p.m., she said.</p>
        <p>In the hospital waiting room, moments after being notified of the deaths, a friend of the 40-year-old mother clutched a crying boy, dressed in a T-shirt and bathing suit, and said: ''I'll never let you go. I am going to take care of you.''</p>
        <p>The Orchard Beach drowning victim, Jason Ross, 19, had gone underwater about 200 yards from the southern section of the beach, which was crowded with sun-bathers and swimmers, said Lt. John McArdle of the Police Department's Emergency Service Unit.</p>
        <p>Lifeguards saw the boat, a 10-foot craft with a small engine, floating unmanned shortly before 4 p.m., and called the police. Officers arrived in a helicopter and a boat, and from the shore, and a team of divers recovered the man about 4:20 p.m. Paramedics tried to revive him, but he never regained consciousness and was pronounced dead at Jacobi Medical Center. The victim's companion, Amin Kidd, 16, was picked up by lifeguards. He was not hurt.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of people who came for an afternoon of sun and surf at the beach, on the western shore of Long Island Sound, crowded the edge of the water, watching the rescue.</p>
        <p>Capt. Joseph Declemente said the boat used by Mr. Ross and Mr. Kidd had been rented on City Island. He said the police were not sure if the two on the boat had been swimming, but he said that their clothes had been left neatly folded in the boat.</p>
