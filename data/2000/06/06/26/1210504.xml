        <p>Let us hear no more about the enigmatic Vladimir Putin. The president of Russia is as plain as a glass of tea. He is an autocrat in a tough spot, looking for order.</p>
        <p>Madeleine Albright called him ''one of Russia's leading reformers.'' So he is, but with a hyphen. His purpose is to re-form Russia, bringing it into the modern era as a nonideological descendant of its Soviet predecessor.</p>
        <p>His search for order begins with  the construction of a pyramid of support, built Lenin-style from the top down. The vertical of power, as Russians call it, places the president firmly in charge of the federal government and the federal government firmly in charge of pretty much everything else. The effort to concentrate power places Mr. Putin in opposition to forces that got out of hand during Boris Yeltsin's frequently horizontal presidency: ethnic regions, oligarchs and independent media.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin has moved most surely to suppress the regions. Presidential representatives named by decree to oversee local governments have now been joined by deputy prosecutors-general authorized to investigate regional governments that challenge federal law. Bills in the Duma would let Mr. Putin use such investigations as cause to dismiss elected local chief executives and legislatures.</p>
        <p>The first targets are likely to be ethnic republics whose constitutions assert local sovereignty: Dagestan, Ingushetia, North Ossetia, Bashkortostan, Komi, Kabardin-Balkaria, Tatarstan, Tuva and Yakutia. The Chechnya campaign and its popularity among Russians have softened up the ethnic leaders, making them slow to defend their positions.</p>
        <p>The oligarchs -- the tiny group of men who got rich by acquiring state property in rigged deals -- are a trickier problem. Mr. Putin promised Russians that as president he would ''eliminate the oligarchs as a class,'' but some oligarchs are classier than others. Boris Berezovsky and others close to Boris Yeltsin chose Mr. Putin last year as prime minister and helped engineer his succession. He owes these men a large political debt.</p>
        <p>While another oligarch, Vladimir Gusinsky, head of the independent Media Most group that has attacked Kremlin brutality and corruption, was arrested and charged with embezzlement, Mr. Berezovsky, who has put his media empire fully behind the president, strengthened his grip on a nominally state-controlled television network.</p>
        <p>The most difficult post-Soviet outburst to contain may be freedom of expression. When the Kremlin set up its Orwellian Press Ministry a year ago, the prime minister spoke of consolidating ''all of the state's capabilities in -- pardon the old-fashioned word -- ideological work.'' Mr. Gusinsky's arrest was clearly intended to exhibit the state's capacity for brutality against its -- pardon the word -- ideological enemies.</p>
        <p>For all Mr. Putin's energy, toughness, and competence, the object of his endeavors is less than noble. If he succeeds, Russia in five or 10 years may have the political pluralism of Mexico in the 1980's, the family-friendly economics of Indonesia in the 1990's, and the most-holds-barred press freedom of today's China. The result may be a happier place than most adult Russians have known, but far short of the hopes that stirred so many just 10 years ago.</p>
