        <p>Two weeks after the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum opened in Cleveland in 1995, Paul Allen, the Microsoft co-founder, sent a small contingent there from Seattle to look around. The group spent two days examining the museum top to bottom. ''Then,'' recalled Peter Blecha, a member of that expeditionary force, ''we went back to the hotel room and critiqued it. We had a big board, and we wrote everything that was good and everything that was bad on it.''</p>
        <p>It was a classic raid, not unlike the strategy Microsoft used in taking over the desktop computing world. Mr. Allen had an idea, he checked out the competition, and then he improved on it. This weekend, the Experience Music Project, $240 million worth of proof that Mr. Allen is a rock fan, opened here in a building designed by Frank O. Gehry that is just a few steps from the Space Needle. The festivities included concerts by Eminem, Patti Smith, Matchbox 20, Bo Diddley, Dr. Dre, Metallica, James Brown and dozens of Northwest bands, from Pedro the Lion to the Kingsmen.</p>
        <p>Apart from its private financing, the Experience Music Project differs from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in three significant ways: its reliance on technology, its focus on local music and its intent.</p>
        <p>The Cleveland museum is in an I. M. Pei building shaped like a turntable, a symbol of its focus as an archive where music history is always on playback. The shape of the Experience Music Project, however, has no clear message. A sheet-metal abstraction based on the rich colors and curved shape of guitar heads, it looks from above like a tall tissue box surrounded by five crumpled sheets of different colored gift wrap.</p>
        <p>From outside the museum, there is no way to comprehend its exact size, shape or structure because of the rolling, unpredictable curves. Based on the curly scribbles of Mr. Gehry -- drawings in many ways reminiscent of the attempts of white hipster artists to visualize jazz in the 50's -- the abstract, organic, visually elusive building speaks not about music history but about music appreciation. And a person in possession of the latter quality is far better off than a person with the former. Where the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame generally advertises using the names of stars whose legends can be felt inside, the Experience Music Project tries to reach deeper into the psyche, explaining on billboards that it is a museum for people who sing in the shower or drum on their car steering wheels. It is a gathering place for the frustrated musicians of the world, like Mr. Allen himself, a closet guitarist. (A CD by his band, Grown Men, is available in the museum gift store.)</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Allen's original idea eight years ago was simply a gallery for showing off his Jimi Hendrix memorabilia, it soon expanded to become the nation's second major rock museum. With the National Music Museum now being planned in Washington, it seems conceivable that museums devoted to popular music may one day become as integral to a city's cultural life as art museums are. After all, on Friday, with a Metallica show going on nearby, there were probably more teenagers swarming through the Experience Music Project (open daily until 11 p.m.) than some museums see in a year.</p>
        <p>The Experience Music Project's strongest point is a room called the Sound Lab where visitors can learn in just a few technology-aided minutes how to play guitar, keyboard or drums. They can even scratch records on a turntable like a hip-hop D.J. or adjust the separate tracks of ''Sweet Dreams'' by the Eurythmics on a mixing board as a studio engineer does. (On Friday, opening day at the museum, one visitor mixing the song was surprised to find Dave Stewart of the Eurythmics, a friend of Mr. Allen's, reaching over his shoulder to help him out.)</p>
        <p>In another room a group of people can pick up instruments designed to correct their mistakes and play the Troggs song ''Wild Thing'' under the glare of stage lights and a virtual audience.</p>
        <p>''The cliche around here is that if you can inspire the Jimi Hendrix of the future, you've done your job,'' said Chris Bruce, the museum's curatorial director. ''If you can reach just one kid, out of the millions of people who come through, and get that inspiration to him, it would change his life. The key is you've got historical artifacts, the instruments, and the place, and then you give people the realization that they can do it, too.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps this explains the most surprising element of the museum: instead of focusing on the classic rock dear to Mr. Allen, it overwhelmingly favors independent music. In the building's permanent display on music history, for example, the Minneapolis punk bands Husker Du and the Replacements get three times the amount of space given to the entirety of the blues.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere, songs by the Japanese maverick Cornelius play on giant loudspeakers and performances by the later-day riot grrrl band Sleater-Kinney flash on video screens in three separate rooms. There are artifacts by indie-rock bands from Pavement to Pere Ubu (a Cleveland band whose inclusion serves as a subtle dig at the more mainstream rock museum in that city). There is a focus on do-it-yourself music, particularly punk rock, on telling visitors that anybody can pick up a guitar and make a record. No special calling, ability or aptitude is needed.</p>
        <p>This weekend, visitors (an adult pays $19.95 for admission) didn't seem shocked to see the music they loved already in a museum. The day before the grand opening (which featured Mr. Allen smashing a glass guitar), the former Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic stood in front of a glass case, examining grunge memorabilia that included a Nirvana demo tape and signs from erstwhile Seattle rock clubs.</p>
        <p>''I really appreciate this a lot,'' Mr. Novoselic said. ''It's comprehensive. They start at the early beginnings, then they show the Nirvana air fresheners and grunge pencil set. It shows how commercial it got so quickly.''</p>
        <p>Hours later, at the night's private opening gala, another visitor pored over the same exhibit, slowly examining each sign and artifact. It was the world's richest man, Bill Gates. In the meantime, on a stage in a giant room named after Hendrix's notion of a Sky Church, Mr. Allen basked in his night of glory, jamming on rock and blues songs with Robbie Robertson of the Band on guitar and Herbie Hancock on keyboards.</p>
        <p>It seemed to be a given that a music that sells rebellion and disenfranchisement is now shared as a common language between the most troubled youth and the most powerful elite.</p>
        <p>On opening day, three teenagers, one in a Metallica shirt, stood around an exhibit on heavy metal from the Northwest.</p>
        <p>''If I like it and Paul Allen likes it, that's cool,'' Jake Zeller, a 16-year-old from nearby Pullman, said of the fourth-richest man in the world. ''If it's in a museum, that's cool. It's preserved and everyone will know how cool it is and why we like it. They'll know it's not just crunch, crunch, crunch.''</p>
        <p>He turned back to his friends, then swung back to correct himself: ''Though I like the crunch, crunch, crunch.''</p>
        <p>Many visitors probably left the museum with at least a temporary resolve to take up an instrument. Still, the ultimate goal of the museum -- to inspire the Claptons and Hendrixes of the future -- is a strange one. Inspiration tends not to arise from such manufactured situations; one could just as easily leave the museum empty-handed, hop on the monorail and reach an epiphany listening to the screech of brakes on the tracks. The next great musical artists are probably going to draw their inspiration from a more natural situation than a visit to a rock museum, unless, perhaps, they are so disgusted by the notion that they decided to rebel against it.</p>
        <p>But it doesn't hurt to try to point people in the right direction. The museum came closest to its goal this weekend not in any of the high-tech exhibits (visitors were constantly complaining about problems with the personal digital museum guides they carried around) but in a lecture hall. Mr. Stewart of the Eurythmics stood at a desk, trying to make the creative process accessible to everybody.</p>
        <p>''There's this place that you can get into called the gap, the space in between your thoughts,'' he told a rapt audience.</p>
        <p>As an example, he played a short video clip of himself jamming in a basement room with Mick Jagger on vocals and none other than Paul Allen on bass. (See, money can buy everything.) ''This is Mick Jagger in the gap,'' he said. ''He's just making up the words and the melody.''</p>
        <p>To drive the point home, he grabbed a volunteer from the audience and asked the nervous man to get in the gap and write a song with him on the spot.</p>
        <p>Upstairs in the sound lab after the lecture, Noel Redding, the former bassist in the Jimi Hendrix Experience, stood next to a touch-sensitive table that served as a sort of digital drum circle. The cacophony was unbelievable, proving that even technology can't make a competent musician out of every person.</p>
        <p>Ignoring the chaos, Mr. Redding beamed. ''I think the whole thing is brilliant,'' he said, ''especially the Hendrix thing. It's very sentimental to me.''</p>
        <p>He returned downstairs to the Hendrix exhibit, where Al Hendrix, Jimi's father, was being pushed around the room in a wheelchair. The two had a brief, awkward reunion, and it seemed only fitting that it took place in a museum.</p>
        <p>''What do you think of all this?'' Mr. Redding asked.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hendrix, wearing one of his many shirts bearing an image of his son, replied, ''It's great.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Redding said with a bemused nod, ''It was a long time ago.''</p>
        <p>Nothing in the room had come from Mr. Redding's collection, he said afterward, though he wouldn't mind if Paul Allen asked.</p>
        <p>''But,'' he added, ''I wouldn't donate them. He'd have to buy them.''</p>
