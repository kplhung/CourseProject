        <p>NEW YORK</p>
        <p>BROOKLYN: STATE JUDGE ARRESTED  A judge was charged with domestic assault yesterday after a woman called the police from 335 Park Place in Brooklyn, just north of Prospect Park, and said Justice M. Randolph Jackson, 56, of State Supreme Court had hit her in the face. A police spokesman would not give further details. A call to the judge's home was not returned.</p>

        <p>QUEENS: GIRL KILLED IN ACCIDENT  A father backed his car into his two children playing on the driveway of his Queens house yesterday afternoon, killing one and critically injuring the other, the police said. Lorraine Williams, 3, was dead on arrival at Mary Immaculate Hospital. Her 7-year-old sister, whose name the police did not release, had a broken leg and hip and was in critical condition. The incident is under investigation, but no charges were filed against the father, Burton J. Williams, 50, of 102-31 183rd Place, Hollis, a police spokeswoman said.</p>

        <p>NEW HYDE PARK: L.I.R.R. TRAIN ACCIDENT  A man was killed yesterday afternoon when his car was struck by an eastbound Long Island Rail Road train arriving at the New Hyde Park station in Nassau County. The man had apparently driven around a lowered gate on Covert Avenue. No one on the train was injured, according to Jerry Sonnenburg, assistant chief train dispatcher for the railroad, but there was some damage to the tracks. Officials expected that service would be restored by today's rush hour, he said.</p>

        <p>QUEENS: MISSING TRAVEL WRITER  The Federal Bureau of Investigation plans to send additional agents to Jamaica to help in a search for a missing New York travel editor. The editor, Claudia Kirschhoch, 29, of Astoria, Queens, disappeared around May 28. Two agents from the F.B.I.'s Miami office have already gone to Jamaica, but last Friday, the Jamaican government asked for more help, allowing the F.B.I. to send forensics experts, as well as a lie-detector machine and operator today.

        <p>QUEENS: SUBWAY INJURY  A 20-year-old man was severely injured after leaping in front of a No. 7 train at the 46th Street station in Sunnyside, Queens, on Saturday night, transit officials said. The man, whose name was not released, was taken to Elmhurst Hospital Center, where he was in critical but stable condition. Two police officers from the Emergency Service Unit going to the scene were injured when their truck was hit by a car in Jackson Heights, the police said. Three of the car's passengers were injured. Two other passengers from the second car fled.</p>

        <p>BROOKLYN: STROLLER CAUGHT IN SUBWAY DOORS  A subway train started to pull out of the Borough Hall station in Brooklyn yesterday morning with a baby stroller stuck between two doors, the police said. A passenger pulled the emergency brake to stop the No. 2 train, said Officer Valerie St. Rose, a police spokeswoman. The 2-year-old boy in the stroller and his mother were not seriously injured. Newer subway cars are equipped with sensors to prevent a train from moving unless all the doors are closed, but Albert O'Leary, a New York City Transit spokesman, said the incident involved an older car.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: SENATOR CALLS GOVERNMENT UNPREPARED  A new study of the governmental response to the West Nile virus outbreak last year shows that federal agencies are woefully unprepared to respond to bioterrorist attacks, Senator Charles E. Schumer said yesterday. Mr. Schumer said he commissioned the study by the General Accounting Office to learn from the way federal, state and local agencies reacted to last summer's outbreak. ''When the West Nile virus came here, it could have been a prototype for a man-designed attack,'' he said.</p>

        <p>NEW JERSEY</p>
        <p>WEST ORANGE: CAVALCADE OF COWS  As in New York and Chicago, local artists and town officials staged a parade of 28 life-size fiberglass cows last week that will be displayed around this suburb until the fall. The architects Robert A. M. Stern and Michael Graves and more than a dozen New Jersey artists decorated the hollow-cast animals, which will be auctioned for charity.</p>

        <p>CONNECTICUT</p>
        <p>HARTFORD: LIFEGUARD SHORTAGE  The state and many towns are having trouble hiring lifeguards for ponds and pools. Many teenagers who worked as lifeguards in previous years have taken better-paying jobs elsewhere, state officials say. Bill Mattioli, the water safety program coordinator for the State Department of Environmental Protection, said the agency had yet to fill 30 of its 99 lifeguard positions.</p>

        <p>Today</p>
        <p>NEW JERSEY VOTE ON BEAR HUNT  The New Jersey Senate is scheduled to vote on a bill that would ban bear hunting and provide $95,000 to develop nonlethal ways to thin the bear population. A similar measure in the Assembly is still in committee.</p>
        <p>Tomorrow</p>
        <p>MURDER SENTENCING  Kenneth and Sante Kimes are scheduled to be sentenced in the Irene Silverman murder case.</p>
        <p>SENTENCING IN LOUIMA CASE  Three police officers -- Charles Schwarz, Thomas Bruder and Thomas Wiese -- convicted in March of covering up the assault on Abner Louima are scheduled to be sentenced.</p>
        <p>Thursday</p>
        <p>MISSING PERSONS AND POLICE  City Council's Committee on Public Safety plans a public hearing on how the police handle missing persons' cases. Committee Room, City Hall, 10 a.m. For more information: (212) 788-6850.</p>
