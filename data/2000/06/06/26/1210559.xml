        <p>In the coming weeks, Attorney General Janet Reno must decide whether to name a special counsel to investigate Vice President Al Gore's political fund-raising in the 1996 presidential campaign. The issue has haunted Ms. Reno, threatening her chances of leaving a legacy of nonpolitical stewardship of the Justice Department.</p>
        <p>She has struggled to bring an end to the fund-raising case, having twice refused to submit Mr. Gore to the scrutiny of an independent counsel. But the issue arose again last week when Justice Department officials said the chief of her campaign finance unit, Robert J. Conrad Jr., had recommended that she refer Mr. Gore's case to an outside prosecutor.</p>
        <p>The recommendation held ominous implications for Mr. Gore's presidential candidacy and thrust Ms. Reno into another painful, politically combustible decision about the vice president, even as senior government legal officials have discounted the likelihood that she will make such an appointment.</p>
        <p>To begin with, Mr. Gore would not be subject to the independent counsel law, which expired in mid-1999. Since then, under regulations adopted by the Justice Department, Ms. Reno has the sole discretion to appoint a special counsel, but only if she finds that the department has a conflict of interest or if she decides that an outside inquiry is in the best interests of justice.</p>
        <p>The special counsel, if Ms. Reno named one, would operate with nearly the same powers that independent counsels had been granted to convene grand juries, subpoena witnesses and use the investigative resources of agencies like the F.B.I. to carry out their inquiries. The attorney general would have the authority to remove a special counsel.</p>
        <p>Ms. Reno, the officials said, is studying the recommendation to name a special counsel, but she seems unlikely to move forward -- barring new and specific evidence that shows Mr. Gore broke the law by lying in an April 18 interview with a Justice Department investigator about his 1996 fund-raising activities.</p>
        <p>Beyond the specifics of Mr. Gore's statements in the interview, Ms. Reno's reluctance to make the appointment has a far broader context than the facts and the law relating to Mr. Gore. Her thinking about cases involving high officials has been shaped by the bruising experience of her seven years in office.</p>
        <p>At her confirmation hearings in 1993, Ms. Reno expressed enthusiastic support for the independent counsel law as a nonpolitical legal mechanism to handle politically sensitive cases. But by the time the law was about to lapse last year, after Ms. Reno had been widely criticized by both Democrats and Republicans for her use of it, she had become a staunch opponent.</p>
        <p>At a Senate hearing in March 1999 to consider renewing the independent counsel law, she declared it fatally flawed, complaining that the outside counsels appointed under the law had ''unduly expansive'' views of their jurisdiction and had ventured ''down every investigative side street'' in pursuit of their subjects.</p>
        <p>She said the law had distorted prosecutorial decisions because an independent prosecutor had unlimited time and money to investigate a single official, whereas career prosecutors are more restrained, in part because they must constantly balance competing cases and priorities.</p>
        <p>The law, Ms. Reno continued, artificially limited her own ability to evaluate an accusation against high-level officials, forcing her to seek an outside inquiry unless she was certain it was unwarranted.</p>
        <p>Moreover, she said, independent prosecutors were judged not on a broad record but on their performance in a single case, which could lead prosecutors to protracted inquiries out of fear that if they uncovered nothing they would be accused of wasting time and money.</p>
        <p>Ms. Reno has sought the appointment of more independent counsels than any other attorney general. She asked for seven to investigate Whitewater-related matters; Eli Segal, a former top campaign aide to President Clinton; and secretaries of the departments of Agriculture, Housing, Commerce, Interior and Labor.</p>
        <p>But she has steadfastly refused to apply it to Mr. Clinton or Mr. Gore when allegations of fund-raising improprieties swirled around them after the 1996 election -- a stance that legal experts have said was based on the technicalities of the independent counsel law. Her interpretation led Republicans to accuse her of misusing the law to protect the president and vice president.</p>
        <p>In 1997, she determined that no inquiry was needed to examine the legality of Mr. Gore's fund-raising phone calls from his West Wing office, based on her conclusion that Mr. Gore's calls were meant to solicit only contributions for general Democratic Party purposes, and that he did not realize a portion was allocated to pay specific expenses of the Clinton-Gore campaign.</p>
        <p>Few of Ms. Reno's aides ever felt there was any likelihood that a prosecutor would bring a case under the law in question -- a 116-year-old statute designed to bar government appointees from pressuring their subordinates for donations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's fund-raising was again under scrutiny in 1998 when investigators unearthed memorandums and witness statements that raised questions about whether Mr. Gore had been truthful when he told investigators that he did not realize the donations he solicited in his phone calls were used for the Clinton-Gore campaign.</p>
        <p>Ms. Reno's advisers were badly split on how the law applied to this case, and several aides said the statute required an independent counsel to determine whether Mr. Gore's statements were true. Ms. Reno overruled them, acting on advice from other career prosecutors who said the discrepancies involving Mr. Gore's statements were minimal.</p>
        <p>Not long afterward, the independent counsel law died, signifying the end of a post-Watergate experiment that failed in its objective of taking politics out of high-level official corruption cases. The statute, with its rigid requirements that left an attorney general relatively little discretion, has been replaced with the looser regulations now in place.</p>
        <p>But legal officials said Ms. Reno's aides were doubtful that the Gore interview would prove persuasive in changing her mind about an outside inquiry, because it did not show direct evidence of wrongdoing.</p>
        <p>Rather, the officials said, Mr. Conrad's recommendation to Ms. Reno was based on a broader conclusion that further investigation by an outside counsel was warranted based on what prosecutors viewed as Mr. Gore's overall contentious elusiveness and misstatements. The interview covered a number of specific topics, among them Mr. Gore's appearance at a Buddhist temple in California in April 1996, White House coffees for supporters and e-mail messages missing from the office of the vice president.</p>
        <p>At one point, Mr. Gore insisted that the 103 White House coffees with campaign donors were not ''fund-raising tools,'' even though a Senate panel found in 1997 that supporters who attended these events between November 1995 and October 1996 contributed $7.7 million within one month of having attended them.</p>
        <p>During the questioning, Mr. Gore recalled that he had been to few of the coffees and remembered ''only one that I attended briefly.'' But the Senate panel found that he had been the host of 23 coffees and attended 8 with President Clinton.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, in an effort to blunt the suggestion that he had been uncooperative during the interview, released a transcript of the session on Friday. Law enforcement officials said Mr. Gore's answers appeared to provide too little evidence of wrongdoing to justify referring the case to an outside counsel -- a step that they said Ms. Reno would take only if there was evidence that Mr. Gore had deliberately lied to conceal a relevant fact.</p>
        <p>Since the expiration of the independent counsel law, Ms. Reno has named only one special counsel. She appointed former Senator John Danforth, a Missouri Republican, to investigate allegations of wrongdoing by the F.B.I. during the agency's 1993 tear gas assault on the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Tex.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Reno may have little time to reflect on her decision. She is scheduled to testify on Tuesday at a Senate hearing. She is certain to be questioned about the Gore fund-raising case and why she refused to refer it to an independent counsel when prosecutors first recommended that she do so in 1997, and again when the issue was brought to her attention in 1998.</p>
        <p>Few in the Senate or the Justice Department expect Ms. Reno to shed much light on the matter. She has never proved a talkative witness in Congressional appearances, and she has been especially closemouthed on the subject of controversial investigations related to the highest administration officials.</p>
