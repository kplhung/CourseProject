        <p>Juli Inkster has won major championships by avoiding mistakes. Today, she overcame them.</p>
        <p>During the deciding holes of the McDonald's L.P.G.A. Championship, there were more hiccups than heroics, more blunders than birdies. Some of the events were bizarre, most notably the one-shot penalty that Wendy Ward called on herself at No. 13, after her ball moved as she addressed a putt.</p>
        <p>Even Inkster, who shot a four-over-par 75 today, faltered near the end. She lost a three-stroke lead with five holes left in regulation, making a bogey on the final hole that  forced her into a playoff against Stefania Croce, both at 281. But in the playoff, Inkster did what champions do -- she found a way to win.</p>
        <p>Prevailing on the second hole of sudden death, and winning the McDonald's for the second consecutive year, Inkster captured her sixth major championship, capping a demanding four days of golf at the DuPont Country Club.</p>
        <p>Both Inkster (72-69-65-75) and Croce (72-67-74-68) finished at three under par for the tournament, one stroke ahead of Se Ri Pak, Nancy Scranton and Ward, who tied for third place.</p>
        <p>It ended on the par-4 No. 10 hole, when Croce bogeyed and Inkster two-putted for par. Croce's 9-iron second shot rolled through the green into thick rough. After she chipped 20 feet past the hole, she missed the putt for par. That opened the door for Inkster, who hit her second shot to the back fringe, then two-putted from 20-feet to seal the victory.</p>
        <p>When Inkster's final putt from 18 inches fell into the cup, she raised her putter in triumph, knowing she had followed a difficult path.</p>
        <p>''It was a survival test out there,'' said Inkster, who turned 40 Saturday, and who celebrated today by earning a first-place check worth $210,000. ''Bogeys are so easy out there, and birdies are so hard.</p>
        <p>''At this point in my career, winning a major is what it's all about. I was proud of myself, hanging in there. I never thought I could shoot four-over today to win this tournament.''</p>
        <p>For Croce, the second-place finish was the best of her career. Finishing well before Inkster, Croce waited more than 90 minutes for the playoff, and when she finished at three under par, she never expected to play again. ''I just waited around, but I didn't think I was going to get into the playoff, '' said Croce, a 30-year-old native of Italy, who won $130,300.  ''Even though I didn't win, I think I kept my Tour card with this. This big check helps.''</p>
        <p>Inkster, who has won three majors since the beginning of last year, became the first player to win back-to-back L.P.G.A. Championships since Patty Sheehan won in 1983 and 1984. But it was not the way Inkster usually wins. She played her final 16 holes without a birdie. After taking a three-shot lead to the 14th tee, Inkster made a costly double-bogey at the par-4 No. 14, hitting her tee shot into the right rough, hitting a tree with her second shot, then hitting the same tree again on her third shot, instead of chipping out into the fairway. ''Probably a stupid shot,'' Inkster said. ''Should have just chipped out. But you know golfers. They are pretty stubborn.''</p>
        <p>But calamities struck many contenders as the demanding course, coupled with final-round nerves at a major, took a toll. Scranton finished the 11th hole tied for the lead with Inkster and Ward at six under par, but Scranton double-bogeyed No. 12 after a terrible drive, then bogeyed No. 13 by missing a 3-foot putt and  bogeyed No. 14 as well, falling four strokes off the pace.</p>
        <p>Ward was next to fall back. Tied with Inkster at six under par, Ward missed the green at No. 10 with a bad 7-iron approach shot that led to a bogey. She missed the green at No. 11 as well, leading to another bogey that dropped her two behind Inkster.</p>
        <p>Then came the incident at No. 13, when Ward had an 8-foot putt for par. Just as she was about to take back her putter, Ward noticed that her ball had moved a fraction of an inch. No one else saw it. But Ward did. So she stepped away, summoned an official, explained what had happened and did the honorable thing, assessing herself a one-stroke penalty.</p>
        <p>''There was no option,'' said Ward, who was trying to win her first major, and who began the day sharing the lead with Inkster at seven under. ''I know exactly how I set my ball when I putt. On a Callaway ball, it says rule 35, and it's staring right at me. It moved. I would not have felt comfortable hitting from that position.''</p>
        <p>Distracted, Ward missed the putt following her one-stroke penalty, and the double-bogey dropped her four strokes behind Inkster. But Inkster's troubles gave Ward another chance. Inkster reached the par-4 18th hole in regulation, holding a one-stroke lead over Ward and Croce, but Ward missed the green with her second shot and bogeyed. Then, when Inkster missed an 8-foot par attempt at No. 18, Croce was in the playoff.</p>
        <p>Inkster found a way to win, but unlike last year, there was no victory dance.</p>
        <p>''I didn't have any reason to dance,'' Inkster said. ''I was too tired.''</p>
        <p>CHIP SHOTS</p>
        <p>JULI INKSTER and KARRIE WEBB, who tied for ninth place (even par), have combined to win the last five L.P.G.A. major championships.</p>
