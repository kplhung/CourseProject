        <p>If rules to protect the environment drive prices higher, there is always the consolation that at least the extra money buys some benefit.</p>
        <p>But that consolation may be hard to find in Chicago and Milwaukee, where gasoline prices have recently topped $2 a gallon, and the industry says the reason is partly a government requirement for additives called oxygenates. Experts say these additives may be obsolete and irrelevant, and may even cause environmental damage.</p>
        <p>The call for oxygenates has always been driven as much by politics as it has been by science. Republican and Democratic administrations have pushed for the use of oxygenates even though advances in automotive technology have made them less useful. Elected officials of all persuasions are eager for the votes of farmers who grow corn, the main ingredient in ethanol, the oxygenate used in the Midwest, and the companies that make ethanol from corn are politically well entrenched, too.</p>
        <p>In the next few months, the Federal Trade Commission, at President Clinton's request, will sort out whether the high prices in the Midwest are due to environmental rules, high prices for crude oil, supply disruptions or collusion. On Friday, Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, sent a letter to Robert Pitofsky, chairman of the F.T.C., asking for an investigation of whether mergers had driven up the price of gasoline.</p>
        <p>Oxygenates are deservedly obscure. But in 1990 Congress passed the Clean Air Act, which called for  gasoline sold in urban areas with smog problems to contain an oxygenate to reduce the production of carbon monoxide, a deadly gas. About 30 percent of the nation's gasoline supply now uses such reformulated gasoline.</p>
        <p>Most refiners meet the requirement for oxygenates with methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE, which is made from natural gas. But last July, after environmental activists had blamed MTBE for years for poisoning drinking water, the Environmental Protection Agency called for phasing out MTBE because of its effect on well water.</p>
        <p>Ethanol does not cause water pollution. Even in the best case, however, the benefits from either MTBE or ethanol are uncertain.</p>
        <p>Cars need a certain amount of oxygen to avoid producing carbon monoxide from gasoline. Early on, engineers incorporated some oxygen in fuel in the form of ethanol or MTBE. But that trick no longer works because cars now have fuel injection systems instead of carburetors, and the new systems include oxygen sensors to determine when the fuel-air mix is appropriate and adjust the fuel injectors accordingly.</p>
        <p>Eric Stork, who was the head of the E.P.A.'s Mobile Source Air pollution Control Program from 1970 to 1978, said the idea of oxygenating gas to reduce carbon monoxide was brilliant 30 years ago. But in cars built in 1983 and later, oxygenates are ''obsolete and pointless,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Car makers generally agree, although they are not eager to dispute the issue. ''In terms of emission benefits, it's mooted to a certain degree in new cars,'' said Gregory J. Dana, a pollution expert at the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers.</p>
        <p>Now ethanol is being blamed, indirectly at least, for the price spike in the Chicago and Milwaukee areas.</p>
        <p>Ethanol tends to evaporate easily, and unburned evaporated fuel is a major ingredient of smog. So gasoline blended for mixing with ethanol must be specially prepared.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A. estimates that the specially blended gasoline costs only about a penny more a gallon. But according to the oil industry, the blended stock has introduced a different problem, the possibility of spot shortages. The current one in the Midwest, they say, is due to a pipeline break in March, as the industry was preparing to stock up on summer-grade gasoline.</p>
        <p>Because gasoline in the Midwest differs from gasoline elsewhere -- ''boutique fuel,'' the industry calls it -- Midwestern stores cannot be replenished easily. The resulting shortage may be driving prices up.</p>
        <p>Sam Leonard, the director of vehicular emissions policy at General Motors, said oxygenates may be of some benefit when a car is first started up, but that their importance for carbon monoxide reduction is declining as cars with carburetors are replaced by cars with fuel injection.</p>
        <p>Besides, carbon monoxide is not the dominant form of pollution. ''It doesn't hurt to keep using it in the few places that have a carbon monoxide problem, but there are not very many,'' said Daniel Greenbaum, the director of the Health Effects Institute, an independent scientific organization in Boston that is co-sponsored by the Environmental Protection Agency and major industries. Mr. Greenbaum was the chairman of a commission named by the E.P.A. last year to advise it on oxygenates.</p>
        <p>In general, even environmental groups that want cleaner air or more sustainable fuel use do not support the use of ethanol. They want cars that run on electricity or hydrogen -- or simply cars that go further on a gallon of gasoline and have better emission control systems.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A. supports the use of oxygenates because they are high in octane and could replace chemicals such as benzene, which is a carcinogen. Oil companies, however, argue that they need the flexibility to decide what chemicals should be substituted for benzene.</p>
        <p>Robert W. Perciasepe, head of the E.P.A. air program, defended the mandate for oxygenates. ''Congress made these performance standards, and mandated a requirement that would help meet them,'' he said. Mr. Leonard of G.M. said oxygenates displaced other ingredients of fuel that could leave deposits in engines that hurt emissions performance.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A. emphatically rejects the idea that the current price crunch in the Midwest has anything to do with oxygenates. The specifications for reformulated gasoline got stricter on June 1 than they had been in previous years, but Mr. Perciasepe said: ''They've known about this since 1994. They've had five years to get ready.''</p>
        <p>The oil industry has become a supporter of oxygenates. In a news conference here last Wednesday, Red Cavaney, the president of the American Petroleum institute, pleaded with the E.P.A. not to lift the rule. Many refineries have spent heavily to be able to make the new fuel, he said, and ''all the people who made the investment, who are in for the long haul, are going to be penalized.''</p>
