        <p>''We are not an amorphous sea of communists,'' Henry T. Nicholas 3rd, co-founder of the Broadcom Corporation, said, rolling his eyes in disgust.</p>
        <p>He had just arrived at his Southern California office -- forehead damp from a morning workout, three-piece suit snug against his 6-foot-6 frame -- and already he was ripping into one of his pet peeves of the new economy: open cubicle space.</p>
        <p>Sure, Andrew S. Grove, the Intel chairman, had a cubicle, ''but it was ceremonial,'' Mr. Nicholas said. ''If an employee wants to shut his door, he should be able to do it.'' That is what his colleagues used to do when he worked as a young engineer in the once-vibrant aerospace industry here in the Los Angeles region, far from precious Northern California.</p>
        <p>In fact, a lot of things bug Mr. Nicholas about the way Silicon Valley technology companies are run these days -- like executives who allow employees to bring dogs to work, turning offices into playgrounds. Or the way venture capitalists have become all but gods in the new technological order.</p>
        <p>But Broadcom, whose engineers design silicon chips that quickly send voice, data and video over cable lines, has risen to the top of its game as the photographic negative of a Silicon Valley company. And its leader is the antithesis of the new age, new economy Zen master. At Broadcom, as Mr. Nicholas makes clear, ''I run the show.''</p>
        <p>In practice that means rousing subordinates from their beds past midnight when he wants to talk about a project, or dictating the company's dress code: suits for engineers and managers when customers visit, and no khakis or jeans. ''We like to think of ourselves as the anti-Silicon Valley company,'' said Mr. Nicholas, who is known as Nick. ''You are not going to be worshiped here, but you will spend time getting to build a product that only you can do.''</p>
        <p>It is no wonder he is called Darth Vader by fans and competitors alike. For like Darth Vader, the 40-year-old Mr. Nicholas wants to rule a universe -- in this case the wired universe.</p>
        <p>It was in 1991 that the former silicon chip designer, who has a Ph.D. in electrical engineering, teamed up with Henry Samueli, his friend and former professor, to start Broadcom. Their timing was impeccable. The Internet was just taking off and networking equipment makers needed chips to convert slow-moving analog signals into faster digital ones.</p>
        <p>Broadcom's chips are in 90 percent of all digital television set-top boxes and cable modems and 65 percent of local area computer networks, analysts estimate. So far, only Lucent Technologies and Intel's Level One subsidiary have challenged Broadcom's networking products, and Texas Instruments is its only rival in cable modems. And Broadcom has taken the lead in making chips for the burgeoning market for broadband home networking.</p>
        <p>Market share like that is hard to come by. So it is no surprise that Broadcom was one of the brightest initial public offerings of 1998 -- up 500 percent from its offering price by the end of that year and up 1,095 percent from its offering through Friday -- making Mr. Nicholas and Mr. Samueli, who each own 16 percent of the company, worth more than $5 billion each.</p>
        <p>That competitive advantage could well continue, said Joseph Osha, senior semiconductor analyst for Merrill Lynch. He predicts earnings at Broadcom, which has a market capitalization of $35 billion, will grow 125 percent in fiscal 2000 as consumers and businesses crave more interactive capabilities over the Internet.</p>
        <p>Mr. Osha attributes a recent slump in Broadcom's stock price (down 35 percent from its March high) to overall technology malaise. ''It's fairly difficult to counterinvade their space,'' Mr. Osha said. Add to that the notion that Internet shopping and entertainment are fast becoming one, and Broadcom's technology looks even more valuable.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Nicholas keeps pressing Broadcom to maintain its edge. ''The joke is he gets by on liquid protein and two hours of sleep a night,'' Mr. Osha said, which may not be far from the truth. Broadcom's corporate culture reflects Mr. Nicholas's own tendency to work 18-hour days until a project is done.</p>
        <p>''You have to take yourself to the absolute limits of human behavior,'' he said, his arms slicing the air. ''The whole concept is you leave nothing in reserve.''</p>
        <p>As if to prove his point, he pulled out a random page from his running schedule from the summer of 1997 and recounted in gory detail a day in June when he was so sick he threw up in a patch of grass and logged that season's worst workout. But 20 days later, he said with pride, he tied his personal best. ''It was complete focus on getting a task done,'' he said. ''That is the culture we are trying to create here.''</p>
        <p>And how do the citizens of that culture respond?</p>
        <p>Engineers are attracted to Broadcom for the same reasons they flock to Silicon Valley: stock options that are worth millions. But while Mr. Nicholas and his currency may attract talent, it is Mr. Samueli, now the company's chief technology officer, who patches up hurt feelings after Mr. Nicholas's frequent expletive-laced tirades.</p>
        <p>''They view me as more their mentor and father,'' the 45-year-old Mr. Samueli said. ''I'm there for them to complain to.''</p>
        <p>Mehdi Hatamian, an engineer and project director who has worked at Broadcom for four years, recalled an incident in late 1996 when one of the chips his team was designing had a flaw that needed fixing. Mr. Nicholas was displeased with the time it was taking and called a meeting to tell the team so. For several minutes he raged, demanding to know who was responsible for the flaw. He finally turned to Mr. Hatamian, who said Mr. Nicholas angrily growled, ''You are responsible for this.''</p>
        <p>''Nick, did you come here to blame me or get a problem solved?'' Mr. Hatamian shot back, challenging Mr. Nicholas to fire him. Mr. Hatamian then outlined his plan for fixing the chip design, and after a two--hour grilling, returned to his office and, for several days, worked until 3:30 a.m. until the problem was fixed.</p>
        <p>Even board members have asked him to ratchet down, Mr. Nicholas acknowledged. At a directors meeting last year, he said, some questioned whether it was wise for their highly visible chief executive to continue sky diving. He scoffed at the suggestion that he stop, citing statistics that showed his hobby -- which he practices several times yearly -- was safe. Besides, Mr. Nicholas said drolly, ''They know if I died it would be the ultimate failure, and I hate to lose.''</p>
        <p>Still his antics, at times, are nothing short of a public relations nightmare. He has the same sort of toys as his Silicon Valley peers -- the Lamborghini Diablo Roadster, the 15,000-square-foot estate, the jet leasing company. And last year, he and Mr. Samueli flirted with buying the Anaheim Angels baseball team and the Mighty Ducks hockey team.</p>
        <p>But unlike the rich men up north, he is more outlandish in his boyish tastes. He loves the rock band Metallica, keeps a metal skull on his desk and a personal trainer on call 24 hours and brags about all-night drinking binges in Las Vegas.</p>
        <p>Once, Mr. Nicholas recalled, he tried to strip an investment banker at a winter conference in Utah and roll him in the snow because he thought the banker was too uptight. ''I love to torture those guys,'' he said. And last New Year's Eve, he sponsored a battle of the bands at a party at his house in Laguna Hills, offering the best group a $2,000 grand prize. Why? He wanted to teach the bands a lesson. ''I made it a competition because the world is competitive,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But he caused the biggest stir on his 40th birthday last October when he invited MTV's band of the year, Orgy, to play at his home. Mr. Nicholas laughed when asked about the porn star who showed up at the party and the police officers who told him to turn the music down. Yes, they were there, he said. ''We had a lot of beautiful women show up unattached.'' But it was not so funny when the party was reported in The Los Angeles Times and he got a call from his mother. ''I mean, my mom read that stuff,'' he said recently, his sheepish grin fading.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nicholas's wife, Stacey, a former electrical engineer to whom he has been married to for 13 years and has had three children with, said she had come to terms with his bad boy reputation.</p>
        <p>''I trust his judgment,'' she said. Most recently, they spent three days with her college friends, river-rafting, Mr. Nicholas leaving the cell phone and attitude behind.</p>
        <p>''People at Broadcom see the game face all the time,'' she said. ''His favorite line is, 'Don't tell anyone. Don't let them know.' ''</p>
        <p>And how do his hijinks play in the investment community? ''As far as I'm concerned if they put up the numbers, who cares what he does?'' said Mr. Osha, the analyst.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nicholas was born in Cincinnati in 1959. After his parents divorced in 1965, he moved with his mother to Malibu, Calif. He graduated from Santa Monica High School in 1977 and attended the United States Air Force Academy, in part to rebel against his liberal upbringing and the Southern California surf culture that shaped his teenage years. He quickly learned that Malibu's hang- 10 aesthetic was the exception in society, not the norm.</p>
        <p>''Imagine my surprise when I realized that by rebelling I began to conform like everybody else,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But when he learned he was too tall to fly fighter jets, he left the academy and enrolled at the University of California at Los Angeles, where he graduated with a degree in electrical engineering in 1981. That same year, he met Mr. Samueli at  the military contractor TRW Inc., where they both worked. Later, Mr. Samueli went to teach in the engineering department at U.C.L.A., and Mr. Nicholas followed, becoming his first Ph.D. candidate and completing the degree in 1997.</p>
        <p>The two men's lives are intertwined. While studying for his doctorate, Mr. Nicholas left TRW and, in 1988, became a founding consultant at PairGain Technologies, a maker of communications equipment, which Mr. Samueli co-founded with two other partners. But he wanted to run his own company, he said, so he started Broadcom in his bedroom in 1991. Mr. Samueli joined the company full-time four years later.</p>
        <p>With business success has come celebrity -- if not notoriety. Mr. Nicholas is aware of the names he is called, some too profane to repeat. ''People ask engineers all the time here, 'How could you work for that jerk?' '' he said. But Mr. Nicholas says his behavior is often misunderstood, and his wildest antics are intended more to shock than to offend.</p>
        <p>''I'm kind of a sarcastic guy,'' he said. ''I love to engage people in conversations, like saying, maybe ritual human sacrifices are O.K.''</p>
        <p>Of course, he is joking. But ''people will take me seriously,'' he said, ''or they'll agree with me.''</p>
        <p>This he chalks up to his fabulous wealth; people are accepting of his outrageous behavior. ''Wealth doesn't change people,'' he said. ''It changes the way people treat you.''</p>
        <p>While he spends plenty on toys, Mr. Nicholas is also generous with charities. He likes theater and has donated millions to the South Coast Repertory and the Orange County Performing Arts Center. He also gave 10,000 Broadcom shares to the University of California at Irvine's intercollegiate athletic department, which was earmarked for the crew team, of which he was a member at U.C.L.A.</p>
        <p>And having fun is as much a response to his grueling work schedule as it is making up for lost time. ''I end up doing more extreme things because I have less of a life,'' he said. ''I figure I pull an all-nighter for work. Why not do it for fun?'' And if there is any doubt, consider his cross-country adventure in January. Mr. Nicholas had planned to fly a helicopter from Miami to California with the goal of gaining enough hours to earn his solo helicopter pilot license.</p>
        <p>He had two distractions. First, he was fatigued. He had slept on the plane from Irvine to Miami the morning after his all-night New Year's Eve party. When he arrived in Miami that afternoon, he found himself ''loading up on five cups of coffee'' to stay alert.</p>
        <p>He also had an investor meeting scheduled back in California for Jan. 3, which meant he had a little more than two days to complete the helicopter flight. The first day he left Miami late and spent the night in a small hotel in Tampa, Fla., mosquitoes buzzing in his ears. Still tired on the second day, he did not get as far as he had expected he would. So he ended the flight in Louisiana, calling for a jet to take him home, while the instructor flew the helicopter back to its hangar.</p>
        <p>Looking back, he said his expectations were unrealistic and he should have allocated a week for the trip. Even simply recounting the incident still makes him visibly angry. ''I really wanted to power through it,'' he said.</p>
