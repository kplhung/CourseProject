        <p>In their first report on this country's national elections, European Union observers today condemned the governing party of President Robert Mugabe, saying it had supported a campaign of violence and intimidation before the vote this weekend and obstructed the work of thousands of local election monitors.</p>
        <p>Speaking at a news briefing early today, several hours after the polls  closed, the head of the European Union observer mission, Pierre Schori, applauded the calm that prevailed over two days of voting, but said his team of nearly 200 observers would reserve their judgment on the fairness of the vote until the ballot counting was complete and the results could be analyzed.</p>
        <p>Indeed, his statement made clear that two days of peace had done little to allay the concerns spawned by months of unrest, in which supporters of the ruling party, the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front, or ZANU-P.F., were accused of waging a campaign of intimidation against backers of the new opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change.</p>
        <p>''ZANU-P.F. leaders seemed to sanction the use of violence and intimidation against political opponents and contributed significantly to the climate of fear so evident during the election campaign,'' said Mr. Schori, who leads the largest contingent of foreign observers here.</p>
        <p>''Calls for peaceful campaigning and efforts to restrain party supporters, including war veterans, were often ambiguous,'' he said. ''Overall, the conduct of the government has failed to uphold the rule of law and compromised law enforcement agencies.''</p>
        <p>What effect that climate of fear had on the vote is what the observers will now try to assess, and their conclusions will shape their final report to the European Commission.</p>
        <p>Ballot counting is to begin today and the final results are expected late tonight or early Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Voters were choosing new members of the 150-seat Parliament, and for the first time since coming to power two decades ago, Mr. Mugabe's party was facing a formidable challenge.</p>
        <p>More than three million people, or about 60 percent of the registered voters, turned out to cast ballots in the election, an unprecedented showing at the polls, according to election authorities.</p>
        <p>For the government, which has been criticized for not doing enough to halt the violence, the high turnout and the orderly election were cited as ample evidence that the vote was not tainted by the events of the last several months.</p>
        <p>''This has proved beyond any doubt that we have the capacity, and capability, of running an election,'' John Nkomo, a cabinet minister and the ruling party's campaign chairman, said on Sunday, the second and last day of balloting, which began on Saturday.</p>
        <p>But the violence was not the observers' only significant concern. In its report, the European Union team also criticized election officials for their handling of the accreditation of thousands of local monitors, which was delayed so long that many could only begin their work well after the voting had begun.</p>
        <p>''This was not due to administrative incompetence,'' Mr. Schori said, ''but to a deliberate attempt to reduce the effectiveness of independent monitoring of the election.''</p>
        <p>Over the weekend, only scattered logistical problems and sporadic instances of intimidation were reported to election observers, who had been bracing for much worse. Violent attacks against supporters of the new party by backers of Mr. Mugabe's party had become routine during the election campaign.</p>
        <p>While the attacks slowed as the election approached, the sense of fear they left behind appeared to linger. At many polling places, opposition supporters were apprehensive about talking openly, and many voters were unwilling to say which party they had backed.</p>
        <p>For the new opposition party, the willingness of voters to turn out in the face of the intimidation that marked much of the campaign was a measure of the discontent that has gripped the country.</p>
        <p>''I think that this incredible determination has demonstrated one thing,'' Morgan Tsvangirai, the party's president, said on Sunday. ''The violence and the reign of terror that has been unleashed has backfired on ZANU-P.F. If their strategy was to try and reduce the number of participants in this election, I think that they have got a rude shock.''</p>
        <p>Wilfred Mapurisa, 21, who was voting for the first time, said he was well aware of the violence but was committed to casting his ballot.</p>
        <p>''We want things to change,'' he said after voting in Chitungwiza, a poor suburb south of here.</p>
        <p>''Employment is not paying us enough,'' said Mr. Mapurisa, who earns $15 a week weaving blankets in a local factory. ''If there's change maybe they will pay us more.''</p>
