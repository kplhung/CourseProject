        <p>The unexpected order last week to suspend restrictions on Microsoft's business practices until appeals of its antitrust case are complete held some good news for every party to the suit. But the true winner was the trial judge who made the decision, Thomas Penfield Jackson.</p>
        <p>For months Judge Jackson had been expressing discomfort at the fact that he alone was making all the judgments in this important case.</p>
        <p>''So far, I am the one decision maker,'' he said in a late-February interview. ''I would derive some comfort if I could call on someone else's intellect to assist me.''</p>
        <p>As a result, on April 4, the day after he found Microsoft in broad violation of state and federal antitrust laws, the judge told the litigants that he intended to ''sever the liability and the remedy'' and encourage appeal of his verdict before imposing a remedy. But both Microsoft and the government told him they did not think that was allowed under the law, so Judge Jackson backed down.</p>
        <p>Still, with his decision on Tuesday he accomplished something very similar. Now a higher court will have the opportunity to rule on the merits of the case, ''the liability,'' as Judge Jackson had put it, before even thinking about the remedy. Sometime in the early fall, the Supreme Court is likely to decide whether to take the case.</p>
        <p>In issuing his remedy ruling on June 7, Judge Jackson had immediately stayed his order breaking up the company. Had he not decided last week to suspend a long list of restrictions on the company's conduct as well, the Supreme Court would quickly have had to wade into a Microsoft request for a stay, ''and make an immediate decision on a very complicated subject, drawing them immediately into the thick of the whole case,'' said Robert E. Litan, a former senior Justice Department official now with the Brookings Institution.</p>
        <p>And that raises another benefit for the judge. Microsoft has argued that he made a serious procedural error in failing to give the company a full hearing before imposing his remedy. Even some of the plaintiffs think that a higher court might side with Microsoft on this question. But now the court will have no reason to consider this issue until the very end, if at all.</p>
        <p>''It takes all the steam out of Microsoft's due-process argument,'' said Richard Blumenthal, attorney general of Connecticut, a leader of the states joining the Justice Department as plaintiffs in the case. ''Now Microsoft will have a full opportunity to present their views on remedies'' to the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>Judge Jackson, Mr. Litan added, ''looks more even-handed, and now there's no need for a higher court to admonish him over the remedy-hearing question.''</p>
        <p>For Microsoft and the government, however, the results from the judge's order are more mixed. Microsoft had maneuvered to avoid having its appeal sent directly to the Supreme Court, where the company had thought it might have a less favorable audience than before the appeals court. At that Microsoft failed; Judge Jackson certified the case for direct appeal in the same order.</p>
        <p>But Microsoft also vociferously opposed imposition of the constraints on its business that were to go effect in the fall. They ranged from marketing restrictions to product-development limits. Now these limits are on indefinite hold, and the company can go about its business.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, most notably, it announced a major retooling of its product line to emphasize Internet-based software powering a wide range of devices. Microsoft had postponed the announcement while Judge Jackson's remedy decision was pending, and said before he granted the stay that the restrictions he had imposed would be a major impediment to the initiative.</p>
        <p>For the Justice Department and the 19 state attorneys general, though, Microsoft's ability to go about its business unhindered is exactly the problem.</p>
        <p>''I really worry about what they are going to do now with nobody watching,'' said one senior government official.</p>
        <p>But several officials, and others, also said that given the judge's freezing of the remedy the Supreme Court might be more likely to take the case.</p>
        <p>''I think it makes it easier for them to take it,'' said Tom Miller, attorney general of Iowa, another leader of the states' efforts. ''The focus goes much more to liability questions, which they are probably more comfortable with.''</p>
        <p>Without this order, said another official with knowledge of the government's case, ''there would have had to be a lot of summertime activity on the stay request, and that might have prompted them to buck the whole thing back down'' to the appeals court.</p>
        <p>Still, even without the need to deal with a stay request, the judge's order ''underscores the need for the Supreme Court to act quickly, now that Microsoft is not under any sort of conduct decree,'' said Kevin J. O'Connor, the assistant attorney general from Wisconsin who represents the states in court.</p>
        <p>But the court can move only so fast under its own rules and is unlikely to make a decision, even on whether to take the case, before late summer.</p>
        <p>On Thursday the Justice Department announced that the litigants had agreed to complete briefings on that question by Aug. 22. After that, the Supreme Court can decide whether to keep the case or send it to the appeals court.</p>
        <p>Still, as Mr. O'Connor noted, ''in court time, the schedule is short, but in the market we're talking about, that's a very long time.''</p>
