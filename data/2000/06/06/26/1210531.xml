        <p>Cassandra Wilson and Cesaria Evora shared the JVC Jazz Festival bill at Carnegie Hall on Friday night: both barefoot, both languorous, both conjuring realms of suspended time and sensual longing. Ms. Evora, who is from the Cape Verde islands off the coast of Senegal, has put a local song style, morna, into international circulation. Ms. Wilson, who was born in Mississippi and is a longtime New Yorker, has reimagined jazz singing as both a dreamy abstraction and a direct line to the blues.</p>
        <p>Both women have unforgettable voices. Ms. Evora sings with a liquid melancholy, gliding up to notes and lingering as if each one held memories of a tearful farewell. Ms. Wilson plunges as deep as a baritone, with easy assurance and a sultry tone that suggests hidden reserves of occult knowledge.</p>

        <p>Cassandra Wilson and Cesaria Evora shared the JVC Jazz Festival bill at Carnegie Hall on Friday night: both barefoot, both languorous, both conjuring realms of suspended time and sensual longing. Ms. Evora, who is from the Cape Verde islands off the coast of Senegal, has put a local song style, morna, into international circulation. Ms. Wilson, who was born in Mississippi and is a longtime New Yorker, has reimagined jazz singing as both a dreamy abstraction and a direct line to the blues.</p>
        <p>Both women have unforgettable voices. Ms. Evora sings with a liquid melancholy, gliding up to notes and lingering as if each one held memories of a tearful farewell. Ms. Wilson plunges as deep as a baritone, with easy assurance and a sultry tone that suggests hidden reserves of occult knowledge.</p>
        <p>Their repertories are inseparable from their voices. Ms. Wilson devoted most of her set to songs from her 1999 album ''Traveling Miles'' (Blue Note), featuring lyrics she wrote to tunes associated with Miles Davis. Like him, she combines eerie understatement with a core of obstinacy and a determination to dissolve formulas.</p>
        <p>Her band, led by Lonnie Plaxico on bass, bubbled up eerie, sometimes edgeless vamps, with glimmers of Delta blues from Marvin Sewell's slide guitar. And Ms. Wilson's phrases wafted above them like smoke rings in a dimly lighted room, creating the illusion of complete leisure and complete elasticity.</p>
        <p>She was artfully concealing the timing she learned from singers like Betty Carter. Every so often the band would snap into more traditional jazz time, with assertive solos by George Colligan on piano; ''Seven Steps'' was filled with precise, suspenseful pauses. The phrases that Ms. Wilson seemed to exhale so naturally were poised to hang above exactly the offbeats that she chose.</p>
        <p>Cyndi Lauper, an unannounced guest, sang along on her own ''Time After Time'' (which Mr. Davis recorded) and in a combination of ''Sea and Sky (Blue in Green)'' and Irving Berlin's ''Blue Skies.'' She did her best to match Ms. Wilson's daring, slow-motion syncopation and enigmatic aplomb, but she only came close.</p>
        <p>Ms. Evora has slow songs, mostly about lost loves, and faster ones in which she often describes the beauties of her island, Sao Vicente, as recalled from afar. Cape Verde was a Portuguese colony, and its songs share ''saudade'' -- a mixture of yearning, nostalgia and regret -- with Brazilian bossa nova and Portuguese fado.</p>
        <p>It's all in Ms. Evora's voice, and in melodies that shift from doleful minor keys to brighter major ones, only to fall back into minor. Her voice rises, clings to a fading hope, then resigns itself to disillusionment. They are perfect cafe songs; Ms. Evora has been a huge hit in Paris, where she now lives.</p>
        <p>Ms. Evora's band varied the tempos around her. The faster ones breezed along like the small-group Brazilian sambas called pagode, with quick strumming on the cavaquinho (small guitar) and perky asides and obbligatos from Antonio Gomes Fernandes on soprano saxophone.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile two violinists and a cellist sustained chords like a tent over a house party. Some of the uptempo material, like ''Amor di Mundo,'' flaunted acoustic-guitar hooks and the slick symmetry of international pop.</p>
        <p>While the faster songs had the audience swaying and clapping along, the ballads were profound. With strings and percussion cleared away, Ms. Evora's voice could be heard more intimately, glowing with solitary heartbreak.</p>
