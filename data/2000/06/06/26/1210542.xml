        <p>After a Conservative synagogue in Jerusalem was set on fire Saturday night, Prime Minister Ehud Barak condemned the crime today as ''an awful act that causes every Jew to shudder.''</p>
        <p>Rabbi David Bateman, who leads the Kehilat Ya'ar Ramot synagogue, said his congregation of about 150 families was trying to digest what had happened as arson investigators dug through the rubble of burned prayer books and furniture today. The fire came within yards of the ark, but the synagogue's three Torah scrolls emerged unharmed.</p>
        <p>''We are in shock,'' said Rabbi Bateman, who moved here two years ago from Randolph, N.J. ''Many of us are new immigrants or immigrants, at any rate.</p>
        <p>''For us, this was the promised land. We understood this sort of thing happened in the diaspora, where there were anti-Semites. But we never thought it could happen here.''</p>
        <p>An investigation is under way. But synagogue leaders say they suspect  youths on the fringe of highly observant Orthodox Jewish groups, judging from previous incidents and a ''calling card'' left at the scene.</p>
        <p>Yonatan Liebowitz, a spokesman for the Conservative movement, said witnesses reported seeing apparently religious men, wearing black velvet skullcaps and white shirts, fleeing as the flames raged. But Rabbi Bateman said it was unclear whether the men were connected to the attack, and he cautioned against reading the violence as an expression of ''the ultra-Orthodox'' as opposed to ''some kind of a lunatic fringe.''</p>
        <p>Strictly Orthodox Jews see Reform and Conservative Judaism as watered-down and inauthentic versions of a religion whose God-given rules are inviolable. Some do not see them as Judaism at all, although they are the dominant streams outside Israel. In a series of court cases that have ignited tensions here, the liberal movements have been fighting for recognition and equal status in a country that gives all the religious authority to the strictly Orthodox.</p>
        <p>Progressive Jews here took the fire as a sad sign that the battle between strictly Orthodox and liberal streams of Judaism had plummeted to a new low.</p>
        <p>''In the States,'' Rabbi Bateman said, ''we saw the occasional synagogues defaced with a swastika but we never saw one burned. And there, maybe it was neo-Nazis or skinheads. Not our own.''</p>
        <p>In a statement issued tonight, Mr. Barak called such an attack on a synagogue ''seven times more shocking'' when it takes place in Jerusalem. He called on ''all Israelis to show mutual respect, tolerance and brotherly love even when we hold different opinions.''</p>
        <p>A neighbor of the synagogue, which is in a mixed area of the secular, religious and very religious, reported the fire to the police on Saturday night. The police said that the sanctuary's large windows had been smashed with rocks, and that several burning rags had been thrown inside. A conservative rabbi who lived nearby ran into the smoke-filled sanctuary and crawled on his belly to see if the Torahs were endangered.</p>
        <p>Three weeks ago, the synagogue's door was singed in another attack, which the police presumed to be attempted arson. Rabbi Bateman said that his Conservative synagogue, one of the most established in the country, had come to the attention of the strictly religious community during a controversy over a strictly Orthodox man who attended services there.</p>
        <p>The synagogue was defaced with graffiti that labeled it a place unworthy of worship, and said that a yeshiva-trained Jew should not be there. Several anonymous callers threatened to burn the building, the rabbi said.</p>
        <p>Today, a Jewish Agency committee on solving problems between Jewish movements held its meeting at the burned Conservative synagogue. And the congregation is calling on Orthodox neighbors to join them Monday night under banners reading, ''Let's put out the flames.'' So far, they said, the response has been good.</p>
