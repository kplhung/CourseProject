        <p>Liberty Media, a holding company with stakes in a wide variety of cable programming services and other businesses, is gaining a controlling stake in UnitedGlobalCom, according to a person close to the discussions. The value of the deal is about $3.48 billion.</p>
        <p>Liberty Media is a tracking stock of AT&amp;T that is controlled by John C. Malone, the cable entrepreneur. Liberty holds stakes in Sprint PCS, the News Corporation, Time Warner, USA Networks and The Discovery Channel, among others.</p>
        <p>UnitedGlobalCom, a European cable television and telephone company headed by Gene W. Schneider, a veteran cable executive, is also a holding company. But rather than owning stakes in United States companies, UnitedGlobalCom holds interests in foreign companies.</p>
        <p>The two companies are planning to combine their South American operations. Liberty is swapping some of its holdings in foreign cable operations in exchange for 75.3 million shares of United GlobalCom class B stock. UnitedGlobalCom will also receive $200 million in cash.</p>
        <p>When the deal is completed Liberty will own 45 percent of United GlobalCom and control 82 percent of the company.</p>
        <p>The two companies were set to announce the deal early this morning, though talks had been on again, off again for some time.</p>
