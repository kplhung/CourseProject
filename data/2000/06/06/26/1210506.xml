        <p>There is no question that bridge is not a game of justice; it is a difficult game of chance in which skill and accuracy are sometimes punished. In the long run the luck may even out, but in the short run players can legitimately complain about the vagaries of the game.</p>

        <p>There is no question that bridge is not a game of justice; it is a difficult game of chance in which skill and accuracy are sometimes punished. In the long run the luck may even out, but in the short run players can legitimately complain about the vagaries of the game.</p>
        <p>Consider the diagramed deal from the Worldwide Pairs this month. Sitting North-South and playing at the Bridge Deck in Hartsdale, N.Y., were Carlos Munoz and Allan Stauber.</p>
        <p>The opening one diamond was limited, since the partnership was using a strong-club method. North's subsequent rebid of diamonds and jump to four hearts suggested a hand with six good diamonds and four good hearts.</p>
        <p>Stauber knew that his hand was excellent for slam purposes, and moved forward with five clubs, showing some control in that suit. Munoz was happy to cooperate, and an excellent slam was reached. The official commentary said: ''The good but unlucky six hearts will normally fail on the 4-1 trump break, while six diamonds is unbeatable, declarer ruffing out the spades.''</p>
        <p>What that ''normally'' means is that the opening lead must be a club. On another lead, South can cash three rounds of trump and play diamonds, disposing of his club loser.</p>
        <p>But West did lead a club, and when East won he continued with a second club. South ruffed, and could still have succeeded by cashing the heart ace and finessing the eight. But that would have been double-dummy, requiring second sight or a periscope. Stauber had neither of these useful items, so he went down.</p>
        <p>The partnership was heavily penalized for being in the right contract, their only bad result in the session. It was sheer luck that the diamonds divided evenly but the hearts did not.</p>
        <p>If they had managed to play in the lucky six-diamond contract, they would have been 2nd in the United States and 8th in the world. As it was, they were 9th in the United States and 26th in the world.</p>
        <p>''Wait till next year,'' said Munoz, gloomily optimistic.</p>
        <p>A charity game for the Dystonia Medical Research Foundation, which supports research on that neurological disorder, will be played on Wednesday afternoon at these clubs in the New York metropolitan area:</p>
        <p>Manhattan: City, 50 West 54th Street</p>
