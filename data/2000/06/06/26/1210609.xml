        <p>An off-duty narcotics detective was shot yesterday morning in a furious, close-quarters gun battle with three men who tried to rob his family's laundry business in Brooklyn, the authorities said. Two of the robbers were also injured, shot several times by the injured detective as they ran for the door.</p>
        <p>The detective, Victor Romero, 36, was in serious but stable condition last night at Kings County Hospital Center, suffering from two wounds caused by a bullet that passed through his shooting hand and struck him in the chest. Deputy Chief James L. Ward, commander of the Brooklyn Detective Borough, said he was expected to survive.</p>
        <p>''He was fortunate,'' the chief said. ''The bullet didn't hit him square on. It hit him at an angle. It's a serious wound, but at this point it doesn't appear to be life-threatening.''</p>
        <p>Two of the suspects in the attempted robbery were under police guard at Brookdale Hospital Medical Center, where they were in stable condition after being seized from a Brownsville apartment building by an Emergency Service Unit SWAT team. The police were searching for a third suspect last night. They did not know if he had been injured, and they were canvassing area hospitals.</p>
        <p>The gunfight began just before 7 a.m., the police said, when three men walked into the Kings Laundrmat, a cramped storefront business at 9420 Kings Highway owned by Detective Romero's father. Four customers and an employee were on the floor. Detective Romero was in a locked booth, behind bulletproof glass.</p>
        <p>The accounts of what happened next vary.</p>
        <p>Chief Ward said one of the robbers, who was armed with a .380-caliber semiautomatic pistol, held the gun against a male customer's side and said to Detective Romero, ''If you don't open the door, I'll shoot.''</p>
        <p>The detective unlocked the door to the booth, the police said, and told the robbers they could have all the money on hand without hurting anybody. But the gunman, who apparently did not know Detective Romero was a police officer, raised his gun to shoot, Chief Ward said. An intense exchange ensued.</p>
        <p>Chief Ward said Detective Romero drew a concealed 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol and returned fire after the bullet struck him. He fired eight times in all, the chief said, apparently even though the bullet had torn through his left hand, which the detective uses to shoot. At least five of the bullets struck the robbers.</p>
        <p>The police said they did not believe the robbers took any money.</p>
        <p>One witness, a clerk at Long Island University who was putting quarters into a washing machine when the robbery began, gave a slightly different account. She said the robbers drifted into the store at about 6:55 a.m., and one of them untied a red cord that held the door open and let the door close behind him. One of them pulled a dark turtleneck up over most of his face. Another snatched a chain from a male customer's neck, she said.</p>
        <p>Detective Romero stepped from the booth to help, she said, and the gunman pinned him against a wall. The man held the pistol about two feet from detective, she said, cocked it, and fired into his chest.</p>
        <p>''I heard Pow! Pow! Pow!'' said the woman, Yvette, who asked that her last name not be used. She said Detective Romero, his hand dripping with blood, produced a pistol and fired back. The shots boomed in the air as the robbers scrambled away.</p>
        <p>Yvette said she stood stone-still until another female customer reached up, yanked her to the floor and pulled her under the folding table. The laundry's other employee, who spoke only Spanish, dialed 911 on a cordless phone and handed it to the wounded detective.</p>
        <p>The detective spoke briefly with the 911 operator, Yvette said. ''I'm off duty,'' she recalled him as saying. ''I shot two of them. Help. I'm about to pass out.''</p>
        <p>By this time, the police and witnesses said, the robbers had made it out of the laundry, and at least two of them tried to hide inside a six-story tenement across the street.</p>
        <p>Shedia Burke, 24, who lives in a first-floor apartment there, said she heard the shots, and within seconds her boyfriend, Antoine Jones, 26, was ringing her doorbell.</p>
        <p>He arrived at the apartment, she said, and told her 8-year-old son that everything was okay. Then he said he needed a shower. When he took off his shirt, she said, she saw that he was streaked with blood.</p>
        <p>He had been shot in the stomach, arm and leg. He left a trail of blood from the front door to the bathroom.</p>
        <p>''Blood is all over, and he acts like nothing happened,'' Ms. Burke said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Burke said her boyfriend, a paroled robber who most recently left prison in April, told her not to call 911 and said he didn't want to go to the hospital. But as he stepped into the bathroom, she said, she bolted into the hallway to call for help from a pay phone. Outside her door, she said, she saw Marvin Young, Mr. Jones's friend, lying in the lobby in a pool of blood. Mr. Jones, 23, had been shot twice in the legs. She said she ran back inside, for water, and returned to the injured man. And as she patted Mr. Jones's head with the cool water, Ms. Burke said, he looked up and said, ''Don't leave me, yo.''</p>
        <p>At about this time, an Emergency Service Unit SWAT team rushed to the neighborhood and sealed off the building.</p>
        <p>Mr. Young, who lives across the street, has a cousin who lives in one of the apartments. The cousin said she arrived in the lobby by elevator as the SWAT team swarmed through. ''I had rifles in my face,'' she said. ''I didn't want to get out of the elevator. I could see Marvin on his face. They were on top of him.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jones, who has been living in Coney Island since leaving prison, was captured a few minutes later, Ms. Burke said. He had been hiding in her closet.</p>
        <p>Chief Ward said the police were reviewing charges against the two, and expected they would be charged with robbery, criminal possession of a weapon, and attempted murder.</p>
        <p>He said Detective Romero, who celebrated his 11th wedding anniversary on Saturday and has three children, was conscious and assisting in the investigation. ''He's talking to us,'' he said. ''He's in terrible pain.''</p>
        <p>Patrick E. Kelleher, the department's first deputy commissioner, visited the injured detective in the hospital with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. After meeting the detective and his family, Mr. Kelleher described him as a hero. ''As he explained it to us, he thought it was going to be another Wendy's,'' Mr. Kelleher said, referring to the robbery in Queens last month in which two robbers shot seven employees in the head, killing five.</p>
