        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In his June 21 Big City column, John Tierney addresses the debate about the role of money in improving our school system. While New York City schools desperately need more equitable financing, any additional money should of course be spent on strategies that actually help students learn. Research shows that recruiting, training and retaining the best teachers is the best investment we can make.</p>
        <p>What's more, it is important to remember in this debate that poverty plays a role as an obstacle to students' learning. A successful strategy to overcome poverty's effects will require significant investment.</p>

        <p>Given the uncompetitive teacher salaries in New York City and an attrition rate that is twice the national average, higher pay is a necessary part of any effort to provide all our students with the best teachers possible.</p>
