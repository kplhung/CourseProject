        <p>California is used to defining national notions of biggest and best: It has the most people, the longest coastline and the tallest mountain, Mount Whitney in the majestic High Sierra, in the 48 contiguous states. But when it comes to public education, California has been more like another of its famous landmarks: Death Valley, the lowest spot in the United States.</p>
        <p>Depending on who is doing the counting, and how, California in recent years has ranked about 40th in spending per pupil, only slightly better in its high school graduation rate, and last in students per teacher, students per principal, students per librarian and students per guidance counselor. When the state's high cost of living is factored into spending per pupil, California fares even worse, ranking with poor states like Mississippi.</p>
        <p>But with the state's budget flush in a booming economy, schools are getting some long overdue help. In the past two years, Gov. Gray Davis has added about $7 billion for elementary and secondary education, an increase of about 20 percent. The state has also begun ambitious programs to recruit and retain teachers, with tax credits and home loans.</p>
        <p>And school districts have turned to noneducators like former Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, who has agreed to lead the Los Angeles system, in an effort to bring political savvy to the task of replacing and repairing crowded schools.</p>
        <p>But in reality, California, a rich state that helped lead the post-Sputnik push for public education in the 1960's, has fallen so far behind that even six straight years of spending increases have left the latest generation of state officials and union leaders struggling to meet what would seem a modest goal: the national average in spending per pupil of roughly $6,600. And many experts have warned that little has also been done to insulate California's public schools, which are unusually dependent on state revenues, against economic downturns.</p>
        <p>''The schools have been starved for at least a quarter of a century,'' Mr. Davis acknowledged in an interview. ''I expect that we can right the ship and point it in a new direction. But this is a multiyear effort that will extend well beyond my governorship.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, it was Mr. Davis's Republican predecessor, Pete Wilson, who began the turnaround, fighting for smaller class sizes and new student achievement tests (though the smaller classes resulted in the hiring of a flood of uncredentialed teachers).</p>
        <p>Recent polls have consistently shown that residents rank the quality of public education as the biggest problem facing California. But conditions in some schools have remained so bad that civil rights groups filed a lawsuit in state court last month contending that the disparities violated the state constitutional guarantee of free and equal public education for all.</p>
        <p>The problems include textbooks that refer to the Soviet Union in the present tense, crumbling toilets and teachers who show horror movies in class.</p>
        <p>Just this month, one Los Angeles school reported that the American flags in several classrooms still had 48 stars.</p>
        <p>The origins of the decline are complex and much debated. But one reality stands out: Since Proposition 13 limited local property tax rates in 1978 and shifted principal responsibility for school finance to the state, California's system has become vulnerable to swings in the economy.</p>
        <p>In addition, a landmark court decision that required rough parity in spending among districts had the effect of lowering the overall average, not increasing it, and education spending as a share of the state's personal income shrank dramatically.</p>
        <p>Like his Republican predecessors, Mr. Davis has been unwilling to press for broad tax increases or changes in the property tax system from an electorate that complains about education but seems unwilling to pay to improve it.</p>
        <p>A statewide survey in February by the Public Policy Institute of California, a nonpartisan research group, found that a majority of Californians knew the state ranked below average in education spending, and three-quarters of those surveyed said they would support a ballot measure to reach the national average. But when told state officials estimated that such a measure could result in annual tax increases of $4 billion by 2005, fewer than 6 in 10 voters still said they supported the measure.</p>
        <p>Similarly, while another survey by the institute found that a majority of Californians thought the quality of education was a big problem, and nearly 4 in 10 thought the schools had gotten worse, a ballot measure that would have let a simply majority approve local school bonds narrowly failed in March.</p>
        <p>''It's really clear that people sense there's a problem, and they'd like to see something done about it,'' said Mark Baldassare, the institute's survey director and the author of ''California in the New Millennium: The Changing Social and Political Landscape'' (University of California Press, 2000). ''But many Californians are not comfortable with the idea of providing additional resources in terms of their own tax dollars. This has been a constant theme for the past 20 years now: a recognition that our institutions don't have the resources they need, but an unwillingness on the part of many voters to see themselves as part of the solution.''</p>
        <p>A group of Silicon Valley executives, with Mr. Davis and Mr. Wilson, are leading the charge for a ballot measure this fall that would lower the threshold for approving local bond issues to 55 percent of the vote from the current 66 percent.</p>
        <p>The state's largest teachers union, mollified by Mr. Davis's spending proposals, has dropped its plan for a ballot referendum that would have forced California to reach the national spending average on education, a goal that the union's president now says is not much to celebrate in any case.</p>
        <p>''If California, the seventh-largest economy in the world, has national average funding, that isn't so great, because there are 16 industrialized countries, and the United States ranks 14th in the funding of K-12 schools,'' said Wayne Johnson, president of the 500,000-member California Teachers Association. ''Being average is no great shakes, but people are acting as if that's the panacea.''</p>
        <p>Calculating that average, and comparing California's standing, is complicated, because the most recent statistics, based on actual spending compiled by the National Education Association, are for the 1997-98 school year, when California ranked 40th, with per-pupil spending of $5,627, compared with the national average of $6,638.</p>
        <p>There are disputes about whether the California figures fully reflect all sources of spending, but Davis administration officials have estimated that California's spending is now at least $6,672, though other states have also increased spending so the national average, when recalculated, would presumably rise.</p>
        <p>And education experts note that per-pupil spending alone is not necessarily a reliable indicator of quality, pointing to the District of Columbia, which has relatively high spending per pupil but deeply troubled schools.</p>
        <p>It is perhaps more revealing that California ranks poorly in a range of ways, from students per computer to students per teacher. In 1997, California ranked 14th in the nation with a per capita personal income of $26,218, for example, while ranking 45th in education expenditures per $1,000 of personal income, with $34 of every $1,000 going toward public education, compared with $45 in New Jersey and $44 in New York.</p>
        <p>''All these problems are at least indirectly related to money, and the shortage of money over a sequence of decades,'' said Barbara Miller, research director of Ed Source, a nonpartisan research group that tracks education issues in California. ''It hasn't been a sudden change. Instead, it's been a steady drift, as money was tight and districts sought to make the cuts as far away from the classroom as possible and things like maintenance were virtually forgotten. Then class sizes grew, fewer computers were purchased and on and on.''</p>
        <p>Because teachers' unions have remained politically powerful, teachers' salaries here have absorbed a significant share of spending increases over the last two decades, and have remained relatively high. But the state is struggling to attract and retain teachers and is facing a projected shortage of perhaps 300,000.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis, the first Democratic governor since Jerry Brown in the mid-1970's, made it clear that he intended to devote the biggest share of the state's current budget surpluses to education. He went so far as to propose exempting teachers from the state's income tax, an idea rejected by legislative leaders in favor of a smaller tax credit.</p>
        <p>But the governor has said he has no plans to seek any broad tax increases. And despite his opposition to Proposition 13 when it passed, and his continued skepticism about it, he has no plans to tinker with the measure's 1 percent limit on local property tax rates, which cut local property tax revenues for education in half.</p>
        <p>Bill Carrick, a Democratic consultant here, said Mr. Davis was ''a genuine bean-counter.''</p>
        <p>''His politics are defined by his experience as Jerry's chief of staff when Proposition 13 was passed, and he will do anything he can to avoid having to raise taxes,'' Mr. Carrick said. ''I also think philosophically he doesn't like these straitjacket fiscal formulas, like promising to reach a certain spending level by a certain date.''</p>
        <p>As it is, under another ballot measure, Proposition 98, about 40 percent of the state's general fund spending is reserved for education, and much of that is already parceled out for several specified programs, like special education, and is not available for basic expenses like maintenance. And because California's school finance system, almost alone among the states, is controlled by the state, it is highly dependent on economically driven shifts in personal income tax receipts, and localities are relatively powerless to use the more stable property tax to make improvements on their own.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Davis points to the effort to lower the approval threshold for local school bonds as an example of a structural change he is fighting for.</p>
        <p>''This is a very tall order, and people are not anxious in this state to spend more money,'' he said, ''but I believe if we run a really good campaign, we can pull this off. That's a structural change that presumably will allow local communities to make a decision to take unto themselves more bonded indebtedness.''</p>
        <p>Some experts remain skeptical.</p>
        <p>''They haven't restructured the finance system in any significant way,'' said Michael W. Kirst, a former president of the State Board of Education and now a professor of education at Stanford University. ''They have just taken the existing system and gotten more because of the flush times. But there is nothing to protect us from the next recession.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 29, 2000, Thursday  A front-page article on Monday about how the booming economy is helping California improve the national ranking of its schools misstated the size ranking of California's coastline (in a reference to how the state compares to other states). Its coastline is the second longest among the 48 contiguous states, not the longest. Florida's is the longest.</p>
