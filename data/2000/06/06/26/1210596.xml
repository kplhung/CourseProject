        <p>Most summers, Albert J. Pirro Jr. enjoys taking a respite from his busy life as a powerful lawyer and Republican lobbyist by playing golf and fishing off Montauk.</p>
        <p>This year, though, Mr. Pirro, the husband of Jeanine F. Pirro, the Westchester County district attorney, may have to devote much time to legal maneuvering to prevent this from being his last free summer for several years.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, Mr. Pirro, 53, was convicted by a federal jury of 34 counts of conspiracy, tax evasion and filing fraudulent tax returns. His younger brother and accountant, Anthony G. Pirro, 45, was convicted of 23 similar counts. Each now faces a possible jail sentence of three or four years.</p>
        <p>''It's a very difficult time for the family,'' said Roger L. Stavis, Anthony Pirro's lawyer. ''We're obviously disappointed in the verdict. And we now have to focus our attention on the sentencing issues and our potential appeal.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pirro and his brother are to be sentenced on Sept. 28 before Judge Barrington D. Parker Jr. in Federal District Court here. And while Robert J. Giuffra Jr., one of Albert Pirro's defense lawyers, declined to comment on the next legal move, both brothers are eventually expected to file appeals, which means that the earliest either would go to jail would be early 2001.</p>
        <p>Lawyers who observed the four-week trial said there were several issues that could have some traction in an appeal. For one, a lone juror -- William Cason of the Bronx -- defied the will of the majority until the last minute. Mr. Cason was so upset by the tense atmosphere in the jury room that he complained to Judge Parker.</p>
        <p>On several occasions, Judge Parker issued what is known as an Allen charge: encouraging deadlocked juries to reach a unanimous decision. The last time the judge offered these instructions was 11 a.m. on Thursday, the fourth day of deliberations.</p>
        <p>''You've got to take the law as I've charged you,'' Judge Parker said. ''Whether it's good law, bad law, it doesn't matter. You have to apply the law.''</p>
        <p>A little more than an hour later, the jury returned with a unanimous verdict, though Mr. Cason clearly looked unhappy. And later he told reporters that he felt some pressure to cave in -- raising the question of whether he had been unduly coerced.</p>
        <p>''What struck me was when the judge said, 'Resolve your differences, follow the law, follow the law,' '' said Kevin Hynes, a criminal defense lawyer in White Plains, who is also the son of Charles J. Hynes, the Brooklyn district attorney. ''Those types of things obviously pushed this juror into this decision, and a judge is never supposed to put the jury in a position where they're pushed to a verdict.''</p>
        <p>But Kerry A. Lawrence, who, like Mr. Hynes, is a former prosecutor turned defense lawyer, said he felt that Judge Parker was careful and that Mr. Cason had had plenty of opportunities to assert himself.</p>
        <p>''If that was his verdict, and he was troubled with it, that was his chance to say so,'' Mr. Lawrence said. ''I don't think that the case is likely to be disturbed on appeal.''</p>
        <p>Another issue is the prosecution's characterization of Albert Pirro. In closing arguments, Cathy Seibel, an assistant United States attorney, suggested that Mr. Pirro was similar to Richard M. Nixon: a smart man who held on to incriminating evidence and tried to cover up. She also called him a ''crook'' a la Nixon, saying that ''justice demands'' a conviction.</p>
        <p>''The whole Nixon analogy was outrageous,'' said Mr. Hynes, who is a loyal Democrat but counts the Pirros as friends. ''I've never seen a prosecutor make such a desperate move; it was absolutely a low blow.''</p>
        <p>But Bennett L. Gershman, a Pace University professor who became a ubiquitous commentator on the trial, disagreed. In the trial of the mob boss John Gotti, he said, Andrew J. Maloney, then the United States attorney, told the jury, ''You would be less than human if you didn't feel some personal concern.'' That remark, an appellate court later said, was an ''intolerable and indefensible'' endeavor to instill fear in jurors. Even so, it was deemed to be ''harmless error,'' and the conviction was upheld.</p>
        <p>''If something that inflammatory, seriously prejudicial, can be found to be 'harmless error,' '' Mr. Gershman said, ''what you saw here in this case pales in comparison.''</p>
        <p>Another issue is the testimony of John Dennehy, an agent with the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Dennehy was the prosecution's summary witness, explaining how Albert Pirro had repeatedly violated the tax code, as evidenced by invoices, tax returns and other documents.</p>
        <p>That testimony was interrupted dozens of times by Albert Pirro's lawyers, who complained, mostly unsuccessfully, that Mr. Dennehy was offering improper legal conclusions and had essentially become the 13th juror.</p>
        <p>In a way, Albert Pirro seemed to feel that the trial was stacked against him. Before the trial began, he had asked for a trial separate from his brother because he felt that Anthony was incompetent and addled by drugs.</p>
        <p>But Judge Parker rejected that idea and excluded any mention of medical records in the trial. As a result, the joint trial could be an appellate issue as well.</p>
        <p>There will no doubt be other issues, now that the case is headed for months of legal jousting. Still, Mr. Pirro's fight will be a tough one.</p>
        <p>''Asserting a meritorious appeal is one thing, but winning that appeal is another,'' said David Feureisen, a criminal defense lawyer in White Plains.</p>
