        <p>Internet Body Faces Lawsuit  The Internet's administrative body, already low on cash and facing heavy criticism from international groups, has been served with what is believed to be its first lawsuit challenging its work. The suit was filed by Afternic, a New York company denied entrance to the lucrative business of registering Internet addresses, or domain names. [C8.]</p>
        <p>Deutsche Telekom Ends Talks  Deutsche Telekom's Internet arm, T-Online International, has withdrawn from talks to acquire Britain's largest Internet service provider, Freeserve, for about $9 billion. [C2.]</p>
        <p>Superhero Needed to Save Comics  Comic book publishers from the industry giant Marvel Enterprises on down are fighting to increase sales.

        <p>Cloning Patent Raises Questions  A Wisconsin company has won a patent that it says overcomes a critical obstacle in cloning mammal cells. The company, Infigen, owns a large herd of cloned cattle which produce genetically engineered milk proteins used in drug research, and it says it plans to use the patent to further that production and related research to clone more cattle. The patent is broad enough to include the cloning of human cells -- perhaps the most controversial aspect of bio-technology. Patents. [C13.]</p>

Other local providers, like BellSouth and SBC Communications, may follow suit. New Economy. [C4.]</p>
        <p>The AP Puts an Emphasis on Maps  If the Associated Press succeeds with its newest project, people who read newspapers, watch television news broadcasts or scan Web media sites will have greater access to all kinds of maps. The new product, called MapShop, is a Web-based program designed to allow journalists to create in minutes sophisticated, information-rich maps that once might have taken hours or even days.
