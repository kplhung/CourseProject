        <p>A DECISION by a stock analyst at Prudential Securities to announce that he was gay in an e-mail to clients stirred interest last week because Wall Street is a conservative place where few senior managers or analysts are openly gay.</p>
        <p>But would a similar decision on Madison Avenue -- for instance, an e-mail from a chief executive, chief operating officer or executive creative director at a large agency -- generate a similar response? According to industry executives interviewed after the analyst's disclosure, the answer is yes, such a step would be deemed surprising by most people in the advertising industry.</p>
        <p>''Clearly, there are a lot of gay people in senior positions'' at big agencies, said Jack Sansolo, executive vice president for global brand direction at Eddie Bauer in Redmond, Wash., part of Spiegel Inc. ''But you still don't see a lot of them coming out.''</p>
        <p>When he was president of Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos U.S.A. in Boston, Mr. Sansolo became the first major executive of a mainstream agency to publicly discuss his homosexuality. That was more than a decade ago -- and no one has followed him.</p>
        <p>''You would have expected it to have happened, but it hasn't,'' Mr. Sansolo said. ''I wish I knew why.''</p>
        <p>The expectation that Mr. Sansolo would have had company stems from the status of advertising as a white-collar profession with creative underpinnings.</p>
        <p>''Advertising is one of the four or five creative industries, along with movies, TV, publishing and fashion,'' said Donny Deutsch, chief executive at Deutsch Inc. in New York. ''But it's so far behind the others when it comes to this.''</p>
        <p>''It's unfortunate we operate in a corporate culture where there'll still be a question mark attached to someone who comes out,'' Mr. Deutsch said. ''Shame on us.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Deutsch, who is straight, said he has encouraged his gay and lesbian employees to ''come out at work if that's their choice.''</p>
        <p>One who did so was Andrew Beaver, who rose to executive vice president and group account director at Deutsch before leaving in June 1999 for the New York office of TBWA/ Chiat/Day, part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group. At TBWA/Chiat/Day New York, where he is now client services director, Mr. Beaver said his colleagues, bosses and clients know he is gay.</p>
        <p>''To hide that is the worst thing you can do,'' Mr. Beaver said, ''because the most valuable thing you can give your agency is your individuality.''</p>
        <p>''And good people don't beg clients for respect; they earn it,'' he added. ''The best way to do that is to be honest about who you are.''</p>
        <p>For many years, gay men and lesbians in advertising ascribed their reluctance to tell clients about themselves -- or to recommend running campaigns aimed at the gay market -- to perceptions that the clients were too conservative.</p>
        <p>''The truth of the matter is, clients are much less concerned than agencies are,'' said Paul Cappelli, president at the Ad Store in New York, a creative boutique, who in an article last month in USA Today publicly discussed his homosexuality for the first time.</p>
        <p>''Big clients long thought of as 'conservative' are now offering domestic partnership benefits,'' he added, listing marketers like Coca-Cola, Ford Motor and General Motors. ''And one company called after the article to say they wanted to work with us because I was 'brave enough to come out.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cappelli's boyfriend, who works as a copywriter at a large agency, is not widely known at work to be gay.</p>
        <p>''It depends on each person I relate to; I pick and choose,'' said the boyfriend, who asked to be identified only by his first name, Steven. The reason, he added, was ''a bad experience'' at his previous agency -- also a big shop -- ''with a supervisor who was homophobic as well as racist.''</p>
        <p>''And I don't feel the need to profess it,'' Steven said about his homosexuality. ''My straight friends don't profess they're heterosexual.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Beaver at TBWA/Chiat/Day New York agreed that ''just as my straight counterparts don't start conversations, 'By the way, I'm married and have a wife,' you talk about your personal life only in an appropriate context.''</p>
        <p>At the same time, ''your personal life becomes important in building relationships,'' Mr. Beaver said. ''As relationships become deeper, who you are becomes critical.''</p>
        <p>In contrast to the situation at traditional agencies, senior staff members who are gay at shops specializing in interactive marketing seem more likely to share that information with co-workers and clients.</p>
        <p>''Ours is a new industry, with no rules and no history,'' said one such manager, Evan Orensten, who is executive vice president for global communications at Razorfish in New York and helped found an organization known as Out in Digital Media. ''People are just being who they are.''</p>
        <p>''And the sheer demand for people tends to equal tolerance,'' he added. ''We also have people with piercings and tattoos.''</p>
        <p>What will the future bring as the gay men and lesbians who grew up in the 1980's and 1990's arrive to work on Madison Avenue?</p>
        <p>''The younger generation is a lot more comfortable with being out,'' said Thomas Cott, president of Out Professionals, an organization founded in New York in 1983 that has more than a thousand members working in advertising, public relations, marketing and the media.</p>
        <p>''To be sure, for a lot of people it's a difficult process, a tough decision,'' he added. ''But there's now more support for people who come out.''</p>
        <p>One sign of the times is that until last month, Out Professionals had been known by a less specific name, the New York Advertising and Communications Network.</p>
        <p>''Eventually, we may put ourselves out of business,'' Mr. Cott said, laughing. ''We won't have to have gay and lesbian groups; there will just be groups. In an ideal world, that's what you want.''</p>
