        <p>Los Van Van was the proverbial hard act to follow when it shared a bill with Los Lobos on Sunday at the World Trade Center. With a set that danced through the history of Cuban music, and songs that touched on cultural pride, ardent prayers, urban poverty and culinary double-entendres, Los Van Van showed why it has has held its place as Cuba's top band for decades.</p>
        <p>The free concert, presented by the Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival, was a Hispanic grab bag: Mexican-American rock from Los Lobos, opening sets of Latin jazz by Bobby Sanabria y Ascension and the David Sanchez Sextet, and Cuban music from Los Van Van and Barbarito Torres.</p>
        <p>Los Van Van was founded in 1969, but it remains absolutely up to date. Its 15-man lineup incorporates the brass-section muscle of a Cuban conjunto, with three trombones punching out riffs, and the refinement of a Cuban charanga, with violins and flute lightly answering vocal lines. Lacing them together are keyboards that circle through perpetual-motion arpeggios and a percussion team that can hark back to the vintage rumba called guaguanco or create a streamlined, jazzy swing.</p>
        <p>The five-minute songs on Los Van Van's albums barely hint at what the band does with them onstage, where they become suites for dancers. Verses and choruses give way to chants, brass riffs, raps, vocal improvisations, percussion interludes, instrumental solos and sing-alongs.</p>
        <p>Juan Formell, Los Van Van's leader, bassist and main composer, doesn't stint on material; the arrangements keep sprouting new variations, meticulously planned and exuberantly delivered. The band's three vocalists also had synchronized dance steps, and Pedro Calvo put on a chef's toque to boast through ''El Negro Esta Cocinando'' (''The Black Man Is Cooking''), which wasn't just about the kitchen.</p>
        <p>Los Van Van's songs are an endless round of call and response: melodies tossed between voices and instruments, vocal lines followed by bursts of percussion, the band spurring the audience to shout and dance and clap. The New York audience, with Puerto Ricans and Dominicans as well as Cubans, didn't always agree with Los Van Van on where to clap along; the Cuban clave, the pulse at the center of the music, is differently accented from the Puerto Rican version. But the music's indefatigable drive had everyone in motion.</p>
        <p>Los Lobos followed up by dispensing the one thing that the jubilantly precise Los Van Van didn't offer: cacophony. During the 1990's Los Lobos sought out the atmospheric murk from rock before the digital era. It has reclaimed the mud between rock's toes and the dirt under its fingernails.</p>
        <p>Los Lobos took the stage with distorted blues-rock guitar riffs and -- inspired by Los Van Van's velocity -- speeded-up versions of songs from its recent albums, racing like a train downhill with iffy brakes. From there it moved into norteno (Mexican-American) songs, teasing at their romantic excesses with raunchy solos from Cesar Rosas on guitar and Steve Berlin on saxophone.</p>
        <p>By the end of Los Lobos's set it was jamming, like the Grateful Dead, on ''La Bamba'' and ''Good Lovin'.'' Along the way it had reclaimed blues, rhythm-and-blues, mambo and cumbia as East Los Angeles rock.</p>
        <p>Mr. Torres, who plays the laud, an instrument similar to a flat-backed mandolin, led his band in airily romantic Cuban songs. Elegant, transparent webs of finger picking supported the plaints of the singers; a darting high-note trumpeter replied with old-fashioned charm. Yet when Mr. Torres stepped forward for solos, they were aggressively modern, full of daring harmonies, quick zigzags and obstinate syncopations that insisted that the music was by no means a revival.</p>
