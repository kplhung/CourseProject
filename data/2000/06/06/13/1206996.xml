        <p>Sunshine predominated in ''Coppelia,'' presented by the New York City Ballet on Thursday night at the New York State Theater. George Balanchine and Alexandra Danilova based their staging of this 19th-century frolic, set to lilting music by Delibes, on the version in which Danilova became one of the great interpreters of the role of Swanilda. But the City Ballet version has darker undertones that are closer to the story by E.T.A. Hoffmann from which the scenario is drawn.</p>
        <p>A spirited lass, Swanilda sneaks into Dr. Coppelius's workshop with her friends and discovers that pretty Coppelia, whom her boyfriend, Frantz, has been ogling, is actually a mechanical doll. But the old inventor is after more than simple doll-making, attempting to siphon life from the sleeping Frantz to make Coppelia a human being.</p>

        <p>Sunshine predominated in ''Coppelia,'' presented by the New York City Ballet on Thursday night at the New York State Theater. George Balanchine and Alexandra Danilova based their staging of this 19th-century frolic, set to lilting music by Delibes, on the version in which Danilova became one of the great interpreters of the role of Swanilda. But the City Ballet version has darker undertones that are closer to the story by E.T.A. Hoffmann from which the scenario is drawn.</p>
        <p>A spirited lass, Swanilda sneaks into Dr. Coppelius's workshop with her friends and discovers that pretty Coppelia, whom her boyfriend, Frantz, has been ogling, is actually a mechanical doll. But the old inventor is after more than simple doll-making, attempting to siphon life from the sleeping Frantz to make Coppelia a human being.</p>
        <p>Margaret Tracey's strong, bright dancing as Swanilda has made the character into something of a signature role for her. But hers is a fairly one-note Swanilda, without much dramatic shading.</p>
        <p>Frantz, danced by Damian Woetzel, is essentially a good-hearted young lout. Mr. Woetzel's easy, instinctual-looking technical brilliance is just right for the role. His Frantz exits in ballet's requisite soaring jumps into the wings, as if he were merely dashing through a door.</p>
        <p>Robert La Fosse reveals the depths of Dr. Coppelius very gradually. When Mr. La Fosse's elderly fussbudget cries out silently at the cruel trick Swanilda plays on him when she impersonates his doll, his pain is truly wrenching. Some of the evening's most nuanced dancing came from Jennie Somogyi, a resonant Dawn, and a breeze-blown Dana Hanson as Prayer.</p>
        <p>The lead cast was completed by Kathleen Tracey as Spinner. The ballet's child dancers, always an audience favorite and here deserving the cheers, are students at the company-affiliated School of American Ballet, rehearsed by Garielle Whittle. Maurice Kaplow conducted.</p>
