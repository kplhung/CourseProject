        <p>It was not so long ago that Jon S. Corzine was barely known beyond Wall Street, and then only as an exceedingly wealthy investment banker with a place in his heart, and his checkbook, for Democratic candidates like Vice President Al Gore.</p>
        <p>Now, of course, Mr. Corzine is the $35 million man, the Democratic nominee for the Senate from New Jersey, fresh from an overwhelming primary victory and a week into a general election campaign against an equally unknown Republican congressman, Bob Franks.</p>
        <p>And, oddly enough, Mr. Corzine is again in a position to help Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>The vice president flew here this afternoon for a nighttime television appearance, and stopped at a south Trenton diner to put in a word for Mr. Corzine. But the talk among political analysts and supporters of both candidates centered on a reverse-coattails notion: how much Mr. Corzine's organizational and financial strength could help Mr. Gore in New Jersey, one of a handful of states expected to be major battlegrounds. Polls show Mr. Gore running neck and neck with his Republican opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. A Mason-Dixon poll released today found Mr. Gore with a lead of 42 percent to 40 percent in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>A get-out-the-vote effort that involved thousands of workers and cost an estimated $2 million helped Mr. Corzine win. The results included better-than-expected voter turnouts in New Jersey's urban areas despite heavy rain on election day.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Corzine ''spends a lot of money to get the vote out in November, that certainly has the potential to help Gore,'' said Clifford Zukin, the director of The Star-Ledger/Eagleton poll and a political science professor at Rutgers University. ''Usually, the top of the ticket leads,'' Professor Zukin said. ''But this is a unique candidate that we have here in Corzine, in terms of his ability to spend money. So it could produce unique circumstances this year.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine's advisers say he has become sensitive to criticism of his campaign spending. Indeed, Mr. Corzine says he will scale back his staff and play the role of a more typical candidate, raising money for Democrats but not single-handedly bankrolling party operations.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Corzine's advisers, some of whom are also leading Gore supporters in New Jersey, go so far as to suggest that Mr. Corzine, the rookie politician, could actually show Mr. Gore, the seasoned professional, a thing or two about relating to people.</p>
        <p>''You wouldn't think it, because of Corzine's background, but working people -- the regular Joes on the street -- they're attracted to this guy,'' said a prominent Democratic fund-raiser who insisted on anonymity. ''He has a sincerity and genuineness about him that's an attraction. And the vice president hasn't made that connection yet.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, who has been striving to make himself more appealing to voters, especially women, was scheduled to take part tonight in a town hall meeting with 150 women that was to be broadcast on the New Jersey Network and C-SPAN, as well as over Oxygen.com, a Web site for women.</p>
        <p>At Pat's Diner, a relic of Trenton's better days, Mr. Gore and Mr. Corzine made a brief appearance to pose for photographs together. They slid onto stools at the counter, ordered mozzarella sticks, a coffee and a Diet Pepsi, and spun around to face a group of schoolgirls.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore seemed relaxed. But next to the loose-limbed Mr. Corzine, anyone could look wooden. ''You have very good posture,'' said Cyntay Matthews, 15, who offered Mr. Gore her rosary beads and told him he was much more handsome in person than on TV.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't look stiff to you?'' the vice president responded, smiling.</p>
        <p>But when Mr. Gore, and the cameras, turned to another youngster, Mr. Corzine kept talking to Cyntay and another young woman, asking  about their plans for college. Cyntay asked Mr. Corzine his name. He gave  her a business card.</p>
        <p>Answering just a few questions from reporters, Mr. Gore said he thought Mr. Corzine would ''make a great United States senator,'' and likened him to Senator Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey, who is retiring and who also entered politics after making millions in business.</p>
        <p>''I see Jon Corzine doing exactly the same thing,'' Mr. Gore said. ''He's got business experience, he knows how to make a budget work, he's progressive in his values. I'd be delighted to be on the same ticket with him.''</p>
        <p>When the two candidates left, it was Mr. Gore who paid the $7 tab. He left behind a $20 bill.</p>
