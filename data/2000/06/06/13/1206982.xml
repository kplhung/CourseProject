        <p>Geckos have admirable stick-to-itiveness, as anyone who has watched one of the lizards scamper across a ceiling can attest. But just how they are able to adhere to surfaces has never been completely understood.</p>

        <p>Geckos have admirable stick-to-itiveness, as anyone who has watched one of the lizards scamper across a ceiling can attest. But just how they are able to adhere to surfaces has never been completely understood.</p>
        <p>Now, scientists at Berkeley, Stanford and Lewis and Clark College have gone a long way toward solving the riddle. Geckos don't use suction, or friction or some kind of gluelike secretion. Instead, they appear to rely on the weak molecular interactions known as Van der Waals forces for their staying power.</p>
        <p>The scientists studied the feet of tokay geckos, which are covered with hundreds of thousands of tiny hairs, called setae, each about one-tenth the diameter of a human hair. At the end of each seta, in turn, are up to 1,000 minuscule pads.</p>
        <p>Using a micromachined sensor, the researchers were able to measure the adhesive force of a single seta. The combined force of the roughly two million setae on a tokay gecko, the researchers reported in the journal Nature, is far more than needed to counteract the force of gravity.</p>
        <p>The fine pads get so close to the surface that the Van der Waals attractions apparently come into play, although the researchers said they could not rule out the possibility that water had a role as well. The researchers noted that the gecko's odd way of walking (it curls and uncurls its toes) and the orientation of the setae increase the attachment force, and also make it easier to come unstuck.</p>
        <p>Why Hamsters Forget</p>
        <p>In an eminently forgettable 1970's pop hit, Jennifer Warnes sang about the ''right time of the night'' for romance. For the Siberian hamster, it's more a question of the right time of the year: reproduction is stimulated in the summer, when days are long, and inhibited in short winter days.</p>
        <p>The medium-length days between provide the cues by which reproductive development is accelerated or reduced (which, for the male hamster, means that the testicles grow or shrink). But how does the rodent know that the medium-length days are preceding longer or shorter ones?</p>
        <p>The answer, according to researchers at the University of California at Berkeley, is that the hamster has what might be considered a pretty good short-term memory. It remembers only the days immediately preceding the medium-length days, and ignores any older stimuli.</p>
        <p>The researchers, whose work was reported in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that any animal exposed in the laboratory to two weeks or more of long days interpreted medium ones that followed as shorter days, and started to shut down their reproductive activity. The researchers also found that after about 13 weeks corresponding to medium-length days, the long-day exposures were forgotten. That makes sense in that if a hamster remembered past a quarter-year, it would start to confuse active and inactive reproductive periods.</p>
        <p>Nonconformist Bacteria</p>
        <p>To infect another organism successfully, disease-causing bacteria need iron. But often the host organism does not have much free iron around. So bacteria have developed special mechanisms for getting and assimilating whatever iron they can.</p>
        <p>But new research shows that the bacteria that cause Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi, have developed a novel approach to the problem. Instead of struggling to get more iron, they just do without it.</p>
        <p>The research, at the University of Georgia and reported in Science, shows that B. burgdorferi is the first disease-causing bacterium that does not need iron.</p>
        <p>The bacteria behaved normally when grown in the presence of chelators, chemicals that remove iron. And when the bacteria were broken up, none of the typical iron-containing proteins found in other bacteria were present.</p>
        <p>The research may eventually help in devising ways to prevent or control Lyme disease.</p>
