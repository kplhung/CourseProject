        <p>The General Electric Company announced another round of promotions yesterday in preparation for the retirement next April of its chairman, John F. Welch Jr.</p>
        <p>The company, which is based in Fairfield, Conn., and which had $112 billion in revenue last year, named Ronald R. Pressman to be chief executive of the GE Employers Reinsurance Corporation and be a senior vice president. John Krenicki Jr. moved up to chief executive of GE Transportation Systems and Tanya D.

        <p>The General Electric Company announced another round of promotions yesterday in preparation for the retirement next April of its chairman, John F. Welch Jr.</p>
        <p>The company, which is based in Fairfield, Conn., and which had $112 billion in revenue last year, named Ronald R. Pressman to be chief executive of the GE Employers Reinsurance Corporation and be a senior vice president. John Krenicki Jr. moved up to chief executive of GE Transportation Systems and Tanya D. Fratto became vice president of GE Superabrasives and a corporate officer.</p>
        <p>The promotions come just a week after G.E. named three other executives to the No. 2 jobs at its Aircraft Engines, Power Systems and Medical Systems units. The heads of those three groups -- W. James McNerney Jr., Robert L. Nardelli and Jeffrey R. Immelt, respectively -- are generally considered the front-runners to succeed Mr. Welch.</p>
        <p>''This succession has been choreographed better than the invasion of Normandy,'' said Nicholas P. Heymann, an analyst at Prudential Securities. ''Every aspect has been reviewed by G.E.'s board, and it will be a flawless handoff.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. Welch has said he expects the also-rans to leave G.E., and many analysts see the flurry of promotions as a way to ensure that no key jobs are left vacant.</p>
        <p>''They are making sure there are no unexpected holes to fill in the last minute,'' said Richard Nelson, an analyst at ING Barings.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pressman, 42, succeeds David L. Calhoun, 43, who last week was named executive vice president and chief operating officer of GE Aircraft Engines -- the spot right behind Mr. McNerny. Mr. Pressman has headed GE Capital Real Estate, which has grown robust in the current real estate boom, since 1997.</p>
        <p>Mr. Krenicki, 38, succeeds John G. Rice, 43, who was named executive vice president and chief operating officer of GE Power Systems. Mr. Rice's promotion last week made him the obvious backstop to Mr. Nardelli.</p>
        <p>Mr. Krenicki most recently served as the vice president in charge of GE Superabrasives; his old post went to Ms. Fratto, 39, who had been general manager of consumer service for GE Appliances.</p>
        <p>Last week, Joseph M. Hogan, 43, was promoted to executive vice president and chief operating officer of GE Medical Systems, reporting to Mr. Immelt. A G.E. spokesman said that a backstop to Mr. Hogan, who had led GE Medical's e-commerce efforts, would be named soon.</p>
        <p>Most analysts expect Mr. Welch to name his successor this fall. Although Mr. Immelt is still considered the front-runner, a strong turnaround at GE Power Systems last year has garnered many new fans for Mr. Nardelli. ''He's increased production threefold, and his execution has been better than flawless,'' Mr. Heymann said.</p>
        <p>Despite Mr. Welch's public prediction that the losing contenders will leave G.E., some analysts think they will stay on as vice chairmen for at least a year or two.</p>
        <p>''It is ridiculously naive to believe they'll walk out the door the first day,'' Mr. Heymann said. ''Being vice chairman of a company with some of the best financial resources in the world, and with a virtually unparalleled management system, is not exactly a third-rate job.''</p>
