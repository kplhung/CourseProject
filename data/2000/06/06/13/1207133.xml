        <p>One woman, a newly wed French tourist, had two gold chains snatched from her neck as chanting men removed her skirt. Three others, teenagers from London, were surrounded by the group of men, who sprayed them with water, tore at their clothing and sexually abused one of them. Another woman, on in-line skates, was pulled to the ground by her backpack by the men, who then desperately tried to pull down her shorts.</p>
        <p>These were among the accounts the authorities were sorting through yesterday as they struggled to find members of a wild, cheering mob that attacked at least seven women in Central Park on Sunday evening after the National Puerto Rican Day Parade.</p>
        <p>In 35 riotous minutes that terrified the victims and have perplexed public officials and the police, the men, whose number has been estimated variously as 15 to 25, overwhelmed and groped at women in four separate attacks. It was a bizarre sequence of lawlessness in a park whose revival has been emblematic of the city's rebirth.</p>
        <p>''I never felt in my entire life that I couldn't protect myself until then,'' said the skater, Peyton Bryant, 29, a kickboxing teacher who lives in Manhattan. ''I felt confused. I felt terrified. I felt traumatized.''</p>
        <p>The authorities made two arrests, charging Dave Rowe, 24, of Hempstead, N.Y., and Tremayne Bain, 23, of Brooklyn, but they were still trying last night to determine who else was involved. The two arrested were charged with the second-degree robbery, first-degree sexual abuse and second-degree aggravated sexual abuse of a British tourist. The police said the men, as part of a larger group, had surrounded the tourist, groped her and robbed her of $200.</p>
        <p>The attacks came during a oppressively hot weekend in which six people were killed and scores of others injured in crimes throughout the city. But of all the incidents reported on a busy crime blotter, the Central Park attacks appeared to resonate the loudest, coming as they did in broad daylight in the city's quintessential public space.</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani moved yesterday to portray the attacks as aberrations in a city that has otherwise experienced a remarkable decline in crime. The mayor said the city remained safe, but noted that some violence would inevitably occur. ''It is unrealistic to assume that police officers can be everywhere at all times, particularly when they are dealing with a parade,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Central Park in recent years has seen a striking drop in crime, a trend that has continued this year. There have been no murders in the park this year. The police said yesterday that from the beginning of the year through Sunday, there had been one fewer robbery in the park, 13 versus 14, and one fewer assault, four versus five, than for the same period last year.</p>
        <p>Regardless of the larger crime trends, the police acknowledged that for the victims, the attacks Sunday evening were bizarre and horrifying experiences, cases of young women stumbling into near riotous mobs  and finding no help from other people on the street.</p>
        <p>The circumstances were peculiar, coming after the excitement that drew thousands to the Puerto Rican Day Parade. The police said the people involved in the attacks appeared to have been drawn to the area by the parade.</p>
        <p>And in the hours after it ended, parts of Central Park and the Upper East Side were transformed into a mad congestion of compressed bodies. Cars -- some with shirtless, shouting men hanging from windows -- zipped in and out of traffic.</p>
        <p>As the temperature hovered near 90, groups of men began indiscriminately splashing water on passers-by along the parade route's final blocks on Fifth Avenue, using squirt guns and plastic containers of spring water to douse the sweaty crowds. Into this area of extended confusion wandered the young women, who were overpowered in escalating attacks.</p>
        <p>''It seems like what happened,'' said one police supervisor, ''was the mob would do one bad thing, and then they would do something worse.''</p>
        <p>The first assault occurred at 6:14 p.m. near Sixth Avenue and Central Park South when two teenagers from Long Island walked into the park and were surrounded by a group of 15 to 20 men at Simon Bolivar Plaza, a senior investigator said. The police said that the men rushed the women, spraying them from plastic water bottles and squirt guns before groping them on the outside of their clothes. The older victim, who the police said is 18, was pushed to the ground. One attackers stole a pocketbook from the pair, the police said, and the men moved on.</p>
        <p>Within minutes, another attack began, apparently by the same group. The police said that at 6:28 p.m., a couple from France on their honeymoon were surrounded by 25 men on Center Drive near the Wollman Memorial Rink. The attack started much like the first. The group splashed water on the 28-year-old woman, the senior official said. The men chanted, ''Soak her! Soak her!''</p>
        <p>Then the scene turned violent, as the men pulled off her skirt and underpants, and yanked two gold chains from her neck.</p>
        <p>The investigator said the husband struggled to protect his wife, forcing his way into the crowd and lying on top of her until the group backed off.  As the men gave way, the couple ran toward Central Park South, where they met officers from the Traffic Control Division near the Whiskey Park bar. The officers called for reinforcements.</p>
        <p>The scene startled Rita Berlin, 26, the bar's manager, who was sitting near the bar's window as the frightened woman was escorted into a police truck. She said the attack occurred just after she herself had been taunted by men who made lurid remarks as she walked through the revelers to come to work.</p>
        <p>''This is the worst day I have ever seen in New York,'' Ms. Berlin said. ''I would rather take the subway at 4 a.m. 50 times than go through what I  did today.''</p>
        <p>At about the same time as the attack on the French couple, Ms. Bryant, on in-line skates, turned onto Central Park South and a large group of men grabbed at her backpack, pulled her to the ground and tried to pull down her drawstring shorts, she said. The attack lasted as long as five minutes, she said. Ms. Bryant said that eventually the men gave up and left, but not before stealing her cellular phone.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bryant, who said the police were slow to respond to her complaint, contacted reporters after the incident to describe the attack.</p>
        <p>The police said the last attack occurred minutes later, at 6:48 p.m., in the park near East 59th Street when three tourists from London encountered about 15 men, including Mr. Bain and Mr. Rowe.</p>
        <p>According to investigators, the women ran in different directions. The men surrounded one of the women, tore her shirt and pulled down her shorts, and then groped her genital area and breasts. They also snatched her purse, which contained $200.</p>
        <p>The police said the women were released and almost immediately located police officers. Hundreds were on duty in the immediate area.</p>
        <p>Accompanied by officers, they returned to the scene, where one of them identified Mr. Bain and Mr. Rowe as two of the assailants, the police said. The men were arrested at the scene. Both men, who the police said had no criminal records, were charged and held for questioning yesterday. Sgt. Andrew McInnis said the authorities believe both men were involved in all of the attacks.</p>
        <p>The authorities also said they had since interviewed other witnesses and potential suspects, and believe that the attacks were all committed by the same group of men, some of whom were friends from Queens. A senior police official said the French couple, who had planned to continue their honeymoon in Washington, had postponed their travel plans to help the investigation.</p>
        <p>The long, wild run of violence astonished city officials, who said the victims were describing inexplicable events. C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president, said she could not fathom how the attacks could take place ''at some of the more populated areas of the park without someone reporting it immediately and with no police presence in the area.''</p>
        <p>But police officials said that the parade had been adequately staffed, and that more officers were assigned to it this year than last. Within Central Park alone, police officials said, 950 police officers were on duty, 120 more than in 1999. On a normal Sunday afternoon in June, no more than 36 officers are assigned to the park, officials said. ''No one noticed the people were in trouble until the crowd had moved on,'' a senior police official said, ''because each of the victims had been surrounded.''</p>
