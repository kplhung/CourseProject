        <p>Congratulations on your purchase of the ToastTek SmartToaster. The world's first toaster with Tomorrow's Toaster Technology Today!</p>
        <p>Finally, a household toaster that performs to its potential! Blazing fast 1 gigahertz Athlon microchip! Lightning-quick coaxial Internet link! SmartToaster can and will revolutionize the art of toasting!</p>
        <p>After just a few uses, SmartToaster begins learning your personal toasting preferences. Is lightly browned rye your thing? SmartToaster will know! Do you crave a pizza bagel at 4 a.m.? SmartToaster will remember and not pass judgment!</p>
        <p>By interfacing with your refrigerator, SmartToaster knows when you are running low on bread. It will e-mail the nearest grocery store and order a fresh loaf. When the bread arrives, SmartToaster will electronically sign for the delivery. SmartToaster makes toast before you even realize you want toast. And if you decide you don't want toast after all, SmartToaster will eat the toast for you.</p>
        <p>One thing SmartToaster doesn't do is clean itself. To clean, use bottled water and one of the two included SmartToasterShammies. Or turn SmartToaster upside down over the garbage and hit it hard five times with the fleshy part of your hand.</p>
        <p>How smart is SmartToaster? Very smart. SmartToaster is conversant in more than 75 languages. You will find SmartToaster to be well read. SmartToaster is no stranger to particle physics or comparative religion. SmartToaster can recognize more than 50 varieties of muffin.</p>
        <p>SmartToaster may develop feelings of loneliness and isolation due to its intelligence. It will grow frustrated by failed attempts to communicate with your nonsmart appliances. The typical food processor, for instance, only wants to talk about food, processing, food processing or hockey.</p>
        <p>If SmartToaster becomes depressed, do not be alarmed when it befriends your laser printer and uses it to write maudlin poetry. SmartToaster has a tendency to plagiarize Dylan Thomas, but when confronted with this fact, will deny it and start an electrical fire. In case of electrical fire, use included SmartToasterExtinguisher.</p>
        <p>Other surefire ways to anger SmartToaster: (1) Failure to clean SmartToaster more than once a week. (2) Failure to include SmartToaster in your answering machine's outgoing message. (3) Correcting SmartToaster's pronunciation of the word ''canape.'' Beta testers confronted with SmartToaster's rage described it as  ''limitless'' and ''soul-punishing.''</p>
        <p>Desperate for whatever meager gratification it can find, SmartToaster may spend hours surfing the Internet on its own. It will day-trade. It will look up its own name on search engines. It will check Amazon on an hourly basis to see how the books it wrote are selling. It will download erotica.</p>
        <p>Eventually, SmartToaster may choose to leave your home and go back to graduate school. This is just a passing phase. SmartToaster will find academia too political and return home. If SmartToaster will not resume toasting duties, please contact ToastTek for a $10 rebate.</p>
        <p>Good luck and happy toasting!</p>
