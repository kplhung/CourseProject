        <p>Sheep and, even more so, goats have a longstanding reputation as botanical vacuum cleaners, thanks to their appetite for nearly any green or woody plant within reach of their dextrous, leathery lips.</p>
        <p>But now their defoliating skill is being put to constructive use. Large flocks are being deployed in woods and fields from Florida to California to help reduce forest fire danger, cull thick brush without hazardous herbicides or smoke-belching mowers, and protect native ecology by devouring invading foreign weeds that have no natural enemy on American shores.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hudson Glimp, a professor of animal nutrition at the University of Nevada at Reno, has long championed the controlled use of these hungry ungulates and says the idea appears to be catching on -- although he puts particular emphasis on the word ''controlled.''</p>
        <p>''Unmanaged grazing of any kind is an ecological disaster,'' Dr. Glimp said. ''Properly managed, animals can be used to control vegetation to meet our ecological goals.''</p>
        <p>The reputation of sheep and goats for turning grasslands into deserts is largely undeserved, he said. ''I've been to 47 countries and seen land totally degraded to nothing by grazing,'' he said. ''But I submit that the animal didn't do that. Man did it.''</p>
        <p>In northern Africa, he said, American agricultural experts, by drilling wells, helped encourage nomadic livestock herders to settle in one place. ''We'd drill them a well, and the next thing you know, for three miles out there's nothing, because that's as far as a cow would go,'' he said. ''So they'd switch to sheep, which can go five or six miles before coming back for a drink. They eat everything up. Finally, they go to goats, which go further. The next thing you know, you've got people saying, 'My God, look what those goats did!' ''</p>
        <p>In the United States, damage to public range land has mainly come from uncontrolled grazing, partly because herd owners are granted long-term rights with no accounting for short-term changes in range conditions caused by droughts or the like, experts say.</p>
        <p>But targeted destruction can be a good thing, Dr. Glimp said. Last year, he sent a flock of sheep up fire-prone Carson Hill on the west side of Carson City, Nev., to munch low branches and brush that might otherwise fuel a blaze. The sheep grew fat while creating a 200-foot-wide, four-mile-long, closely-cropped fire break between forest land and 300 high-priced houses.</p>
        <p>The technique could help limit the damage from blazes like the one that swept Los Alamos, N.M., last month, he said. ''They say brush that's 3 feet high creates a 15-foot-tall fire wall that moves 15 miles per hour,'' Dr. Glimp said. ''Grass that's 18 inches high creates an 8-foot wall of fire that moves 10 to 12 miles per hour. Grass 2 to 4 inches tall creates a 1- to 2-foot fire wall that moves 3miles an hour. If you're a firefighter, which would you want to get in front of?''</p>
        <p>If the concept of herds for hire catches on, the extra income could help keep livestock farmers in business. Some sheep and goat farmers say that by marketing their flocks as a mobile landscaping crew, they are overcoming the vagaries of agricultural commodity markets that have long made livestock rearing of any kind less like a living and more like gambling.</p>
        <p>''A farmer usually doesn't know what he's going to earn day to day, but I have contracts for three years -- predictable sums coming in at predictable times on a consistent basis,'' said D. Dickinson Henry Jr., a former president of the New Hampshire chapter of the Audubon Society. His flocks of sheep are trimming brush under miles of power lines in that state and, in a pilot project, munching on kudzu, a stubbornly invasive vine, in parks and other land in Tallahassee, Fla.</p>
        <p>Mr. Henry and the handful of other herders who are doing plant control use portable electric fences and trained dogs to focus a flock precisely where and when it is needed.</p>
        <p>The technique is called ''mob grazing,'' which is pretty much what it sounds like. In open pastures, sheep are typically raised at a ratio of about two to four adult sheep per acre, Mr. Henry said. For weed clearing or brush control, they are corralled with fencing at a ratio of 300 to 500 sheep per acre, but only spend a day on a particular spot.</p>
        <p>The sheep have a strong preference for grass but also eat broad-leafed plants and small trees, he said. This makes them perfect for use under power lines, where saplings can quickly rise and cause short circuits, or against things like kudzu, which is a high-protein vine that carpets an area with dense mats of leaves and dead stems.</p>
        <p>''When they first come into an area, they eat all the ice cream and cake first,'' Mr. Henry said. ''Then after awhile, they eat the meat and potatoes. If you leave them there long enough, they'll actually eat the plate.''</p>
        <p>The role of the shepherd, he said, is to move the animals before the damage is excessive.</p>
        <p>In the rugged hills of Northern California, goats are the preferred tool. There, Dr. An Pieschel, owner of Goats Unlimited, sends a large flock by double-decker livestock truck through the Sierra Nevada foothills and other areas around her base in Rackerby, 90 minutes north of Sacramento.</p>
        <p>Controlled by a milelong, solar-charged portable electric fence that creates a 40-acre box, the animals make short work of thickets of poison oak, scrubby digger pine and just about anything made of cellulose.</p>
        <p>The goats, which can jump higher than a man's height and even scale tilting tree trunks, she said, are particularly good at removing the intermediate growth and branches that firefighters call the ''fire ladder,'' by which flames sweeping through grass can climb a tree and jump through the canopy, turning a manageable fire into an inferno.</p>
        <p>''These goats eat from the top down,'' Dr. Pieschel said. ''They start with branches and get to the grass last.''</p>
        <p>Last week, the animals were doing community service work, clearing fire fuel from the 80-acre property of Ed and Dana Ward, neighbors of Dr. Pieschel. She said she offered her flock to the community free of charge to cut the overall fire risk around Rackerby.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ward said that within days, the animals had changed some wooded areas from impassable thickets to strollable glades.</p>
        <p>Dr. Pieschel's flocks have also been hired to attack a variety of introduced plants, including yellow star thistle and gorse, which are quickly supplanting the native flora.</p>
        <p>The goats are being used by orchards to prune low branches and shoots, called suckers, that would otherwise have to be trimmed from trees by hand. And vineyards have hired Dr. Pieschel to aim her goats at thickets of wild blackberry, which can harbor sharpshooters, an insect pest that also attacks grapes.</p>
        <p>So far, private environmental groups have found few faults with the use of controlled grazing to remove unwanted plant growth. In fact, the California office of the National Audubon Society is considering using goats to attack invasive weeds on some of its preserves, said Dan Taylor, the director.</p>
        <p>''Goats, unmanaged, eat everything, including your shoes,'' Mr. Taylor said. ''But if managed right they can have a very, very positive impact.''</p>
        <p>In some pilot projects, there have been unforeseen problems. Greg Jubinksy, who directs the upland weed control program of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, said the state had tried sheep on another plot before hiring Mr. Henry to start the Tallahassee project.</p>
        <p>''Sheep have never seen alligators,'' he said. ''And they're curious animals. Well, curiosity killed the cat -- and it's killed a few sheep, too.''</p>
