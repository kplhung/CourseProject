        <p>At any moment, one company stands in the spotlight of the middle ring in the stock market's never-ending circus. It may not be the biggest corporation in the world, or the most profitable, but somehow it both mirrors and leads the market's broader action.</p>
        <p>For most of the 1990's, as personal computers moved from expensive toy to ubiquitous tool, Microsoft was that company. But with the Internet now more important than the PC, and Microsoft caught in a brutal antitrust fight, the software giant has lost its leadership to Cisco Systems, the San Jose, Calif., company that makes much of the equipment that powers the Internet.</p>
        <p>The shift took place between March 1999 and March 2000, as Cisco's stock tripled, swelling the company's market capitalization by $380 billion, to $560 billion. To put that number in perspective, in just one year Cisco gained more market value than Merck, Coca-Cola and General Motors combined have built in their corporate histories.</p>
        <p>Cisco ''is as close to a bellwether as we have,'' said Giri Devulapally, vice president of T. Rowe Price, a Maryland mutual fund company that owns more than 28 million Cisco shares.</p>
        <p>Even compared with its market value, which ranks third behind General Electric and Intel, Cisco's importance is outsized. The company is often the most heavily traded stock in the United States, with 50 million or more shares regularly changing hands in a day. In May, Cisco slumped more than 20 percent after a negative Barron's article, and the Nasdaq composite index slumped with it.</p>
        <p>At first glance, Cisco may appear to be Exhibit A for investors worried that stocks remain too expensive despite their recent swoon. Even with its slide, Cisco trades at more than 125 times its earnings, five times the average for the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index. To justify that valuation, Cisco's earnings must grow far faster than those of most other companies.</p>
        <p>Can they? Among Wall Street analysts and institutional investors, the consensus answer is a surprisingly firm yes. First, the bulls point to Cisco's history. In its July 1990 fiscal year, Cisco reported $70 million in sales and $14 million in profit. This year, analysts are expecting it to report $19 billion in sales and almost $4 billion in profits, a 300-fold increase.</p>
        <p>Even more surprising, Cisco's growth has actually accelerated over the last two years. Many newly public companies are able to post a year or two of strong sales growth off a small base, but their growth almost always slows over time, thanks to what investment professionals call the law of large numbers.</p>
        <p>As they grow, companies saturate their markets, become more complex and difficult to manage, and face larger and more entrenched competitors. And the mathematics of compounding requires a company to post ever-larger dollar increases in sales just to keep its growth rate flat.</p>
        <p>But for now, Cisco is defying the law of large numbers. Except for one small blip, its year-over-year sales growth has increased for nine consecutive quarters, to an amazing 55 percent in its most recent quarter, ended April 30. Cisco's quarterly sales are now almost $5 billion, and its profits before special charges topped $1 billion for the first time last quarter.</p>
        <p>''For a company that is as big as they are, the growth rate that they are achieving is pretty impressive,'' said Bill Keithler, manager of the Invesco Technology fund, which owns nearly $200 million worth of Cisco shares. ''We wish every company had Cisco's fundamentals.''</p>
        <p>And Cisco's growth is likely to continue at better than 30 percent a year for the next five years, analysts say. Cisco already dominates the market for the equipment that companies use to set up their internal networking systems and connect to the Internet. But the company is pushing heavily to get into the even bigger business of providing the equipment used by the largest telecommunications companies.</p>
        <p>That ''service provider'' market, which will top $100 billion this year and is growing at more than 10 percent annually, is a huge opportunity for Cisco, said Stephen Koffler, an analyst at First Union Securities. It is dominated by Lucent Technologies and Nortel Networks, but Cisco has quickly won a foothold, he said.</p>
        <p>''Cisco competes against a very broad group of companies, and their market share, especially in the service-provider segment, is still very low,'' Mr. Koffler said. ''Their ability to take market share is what gives the company the potential to grow.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Koffler thinks that Cisco's annual sales will triple over the next five years, to more than $50 billion. ''If that sounds impossible, remember that Lucent is almost on a $40 billion run rate'' of annual sales, he said.</p>
        <p>Martin Pyykkonen, an analyst at CIBC World Markets, said Cisco had the potential to dominate Lucent and Nortel in the service-provider business the same way it defeated Cabletron Systems and 3Com Corporation in the Internet equipment market.</p>
        <p>For Cisco to prosper, ''all that really has to happen is for the Internet to continue to grow,'' Mr. Pyykkonen said. ''I think they can grow into the valuation and convince people that there is still upside to come over the next year.''</p>
        <p>To be sure, no one is arguing Cisco is cheap, and some analysts remain wary of the company's valuation.</p>
        <p>''It's sort of the devil on one shoulder and the angel on the other,'' said Paul Sagawa, a research analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company, of the tension between Cisco's valuation and its growth. ''Under the old way the market worked, you'd say, Cisco, great company, fully valued here, maybe even overvalued relative to its expectations.''</p>
        <p>Now Mr. Sagawa thinks Cisco investors might be in for a stretch of slow performance. If the market for technology stocks has actually cooled significantly, ''we're back to where Cisco has to surprise, and there's probably going to be some multiple contraction over time,'' he said, implying that Cisco's stock might fall even if its earnings increase as its price-earnings ratio shrinks. And unlike some other analysts, Mr. Sagawa thinks Cisco may have a harder time dominating the service-provider business.</p>
        <p>But even he rates Cisco as an ''outperform,'' Bernstein's highest rating. ''As far as having it as a core holding, it's hard to argue against it,'' Mr. Sagawa said, because Cisco's equipment has become essentially the default choice for corporations looking to buy Internet equipment. ''You can turn the keys over to them, and they will take good care of you.''</p>
