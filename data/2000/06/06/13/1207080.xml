        <p>The Supreme Court today spared managed health care from a potentially fatal legal attack, ruling unanimously that the financial incentives that health maintenance organizations give doctors to hold down costs do not make the H.M.O.'s liable to suit in federal court for violating a duty to put their patients first.</p>
        <p>''No H.M.O. organization could survive without some incentive connecting physician reward with treatment rationing,'' Justice David H. Souter wrote for the court. Noting that Congress had given its blessing to this form of health care delivery, he said, ''The judiciary has no warrant to precipitate the upheaval that would follow'' if the essential structure of managed care was itself a source of legal liability.</p>
        <p>The court dismissed a federal lawsuit by a woman whose appendix burst after her health maintenance organization in Urbana, Ill., forced her to wait eight days for a test to diagnose her abdominal pain. The decision leaves such lawsuits in the province of state courts, while at the same time handing back to Congress the issue of patients' rights as a matter of federal policy.</p>
        <p>The relationship between federal and state law in this area is highly complex, and the decision today was not likely to be the court's last word, with important questions that were not presented in this case remaining to be resolved.</p>
        <p>One question is under what circumstances the federal law at issue, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, known as Erisa, pre-empts state law and forces plaintiffs into federal court with cases they might have preferred to pursue under state law where, in contrast to Erisa, punitive damages are often available.</p>
        <p>The case before the court today was atypical in that once the plaintiff, Cynthia Herdrich, was forced into federal court by the defendant, the Carle Clinic, she sought to invoke Erisa to expand the reach of what had been a conventional malpractice suit in Illinois state court. Ms. Herdrich won a $35,000 judgment under Illinois malpractice law, an aspect of the case that was not before the court today.</p>
        <p>Her theory under Erisa was that, by giving doctors a share of the profits at the end of the year, the H.M.O. was giving them an incentive to make treatment decisions in their own interest rather than in the interest of their patients and was thereby breaching its duty to the members of the employee benefits plan to whom it was obliged to provide medical care. Erisa governs employer-sponsored pension and health plans, and Ms. Herdrich received her health coverage through her husband's employer, the State Farm Insurance Company.</p>
        <p>It was this theory that the court rejected today, overturning a decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago, which had found the theory valid and ruled in 1998 that Ms. Herdrich's suit could proceed.</p>
        <p>The legal question for the court was one of statutory interpretation. Erisa places on those who manage, advise or administer a benefits plan a fiduciary obligation to discharge their duties ''solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries.'' So in order to evaluate this lawsuit, the court needed to decide whether treatment decisions made by doctors on behalf of an H.M.O. were fiduciary actions of the sort to which the Erisa obligation applied in the first place.</p>
        <p>Justice Souter said they were not. Noting that when Congress enacted Erisa, its focus was on widespread irregularities in employer-sponsored pension plans, he said he doubted that Congress meant to cover ''the sorts of decisions made by licensed medical practitioners millions of times every day, in every possible medical setting.''</p>
        <p>He added that the court's doubt ''hardens into conviction when we consider the consequences'' of permitting such suits to be brought. The result ''would be nothing less than elimination of the for-profit H.M.O.'' and, quite possibly, nonprofit ones as well, Justice Souter said.</p>
        <p>''Recovery would be warranted simply upon showing that the profit incentive to ration care would generally affect'' doctors' treatment decisions, he said, and would ''federalize malpractice litigation in the name of fiduciary duty.''</p>
        <p>In a potentially significant part of the decision, Pegram v. Herdrich, No. 98-1949, the court suggested without saying so explicitly that because treatment decisions are not covered by Erisa, defendants can no longer invoke the doctrine of Erisa pre-emption to take such cases out of state court.</p>
        <p>But the court drew a distinction between decisions involving how to treat a particular medical problem, as in this case, and decisions about whether a particular condition or treatment was eligible for coverage under the plan.</p>
        <p>The question of how Erisa applies to what Justice Souter called a ''pure eligibility'' decision, and whether the federal law pre-empts state court lawsuits challenging H.M.O. eligibility policies, is now before the court in two cases on which the justices have deferred action while they decided the case today. The court is likely to announce a week from today whether it will accept either of these cases or whether it will permit the lower courts to continue making law in this area.</p>
        <p>In a footnote, the opinion contained an almost off-hand indication that Erisa might provide a route to another type of legal attack against managed care, suggesting that H.M.O.'s may breach their fiduciary duty to members by not disclosing financial arrangements that give doctors an incentive to ration care.</p>
        <p>''Although we are not presented with the issue here,'' Justice Souter said, ''it could be argued that Carle is a fiduciary insofar as it has discretionary authority to administer the plan, and so it is obligated to disclose characteristics of the plan and of those who provide services to the plan, if that information affects beneficiaries' material interests.'' He noted that ''fiduciary duty to disclose is not necessarily coextensive with fiduciary responsibility for the subject matter of the disclosure.''</p>
        <p>This discussion was good news for a group of plaintiffs' lawyers who are using such a theory to pursue Erisa suits against major managed care organizations. Jerome Marcus, a lawyer in Philadelphia who is part of the plaintiffs' group, said in an interview today that the duty-to-disclose theory was particularly attractive because it does not depend on any particular plaintiff having requested the information from a particular plan. ''The duty's just there,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Under this theory, Mr. Marcus said, the market for health care services would have deemed H.M.O.'s with such arrangements to be less valuable if the information about their financial structure had been known, and the organizations could be found to have benefited from ''unjust enrichment'' by withholding the information.</p>
        <p>For the health care industry, the news today was very good indeed, as stocks in several health-maintenance companies went up significantly. ''H.M.O.'s can continue to do business,'' said Carter G. Phillips, a Washington lawyer who argued the appeal for the H.M.O. in this case. He praised the court for a ''balanced analysis'' of the entire health care delivery system. ''We're way ahead of the game when we get a unanimous opinion out of the U. S. Supreme Court without anyone tossing mud at H.M.O.'s,'' Mr. Phillips said.</p>
