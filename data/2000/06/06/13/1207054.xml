        <p>THE REPUBLICANS</p>
        <p>STARS, BARS AND BRUISES -- Gov. George W. Bush was criticized during the primary campaign for refusing to take sides in the emotional debate over the Confederate flag flying atop South Carolina's Capitol. But over the weekend in Texas, the governor played a role in the replacement of two State Supreme Court plaques featuring Confederate flags with new plaques devoid of any Confederate symbols. The replacement was the work of the state's General Services Commission, which acted in consultation with the governor's office and the Supreme Court. Bush aides say it was ''strictly a Texas issue,'' totally unrelated to either the presidential campaign or the South Carolina dispute. The Texas plaques had generated debate in recent months after the state chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People asked that they be taken down. N.A.A.C.P. officials praised Mr. Bush for ''putting principle above politics,'' but groups opposed to replacing the plaques, which were removed on Friday night, have vowed daily demonstrations and a court suit. ''This is a sad day when officials of the state come in the dead of night and rip our heritage off the walls of a public building,'' said Kirk Lyons, director of the North Carolina-based Southern Legal Resource Center.</p>

        <p>NOT ME, McCAIN REPEATS -- Senator John McCain said yesterday, again and again and again, that there was no basis to continuing speculation that he might consider serving as Gov. George W. Bush's running mate. But the speculation continued nonetheless, driven this time by a column in which Robert Novak wrote that during a private breakfast with Republican lawmakers on May 17, Mr. McCain said he might change his mind if his running would ensure a Bush victory. Asked by Reuters about that report, Mr. McCain said he had made it ''very clear'' to Mr. Bush that he did not want to be vice president. And ''I will not be,'' he added. But in an interview with CBS News, Mr. McCain had a slightly different take. ''I may have said it, but what I meant to say was that I asked Governor Bush not to consider me,'' he said. ''The scenario is just not there.'' Then, on the Don Imus show on MSNBC, he offered still another nuance. Asked whether he had told the lawmakers that he would run with Mr. Bush if it would help Republicans keep control of Congress, he replied: ''No. I don't want to be considered. I kept being pressed by several of the House people. I said, you know, something along the lines, you know, 'If it was just an incredible situation.' There is never a scenario that it is absolutely impossible under any circumstances. But there is no circumstance that I can foresee.''</p>

        <p>NEW AIDE FOR BUSH -- The Bush campaign is picking up a new senior adviser from one of the governor's top Senate allies, an addition that will help shore up the sometimes tenuous ties between Mr. Bush and Capitol Hill Republicans. The new hire, Kyle Simmons, chief of staff to Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate Republican re-election campaign chairman, will join Bush headquarters in Austin later this month with the title of deputy political director. In enlisting Mr. Simmons, the governor gains a skilled political operative who is also familiar with Kentucky, a battleground state this fall. Kentucky has a Democratic governor, but both senators are Republican and the House delegation is dominated, 5 to 1, by Republicans. Mr. Simmons ran Mr. McConnell's successful re-election campaign in 1996, as well as Jim Bunning's razor-thin Senate victory in 1998.</p>
