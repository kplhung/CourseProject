        <p>From the moment it hit the streets of Boston in 1970, the groundbreaking women's health book ''Our Bodies, Ourselves'' -- then a newsprint edition with no cover that sold for 35 cents -- roused its readers to question medical authority and seize control of their own health care.</p>
        <p>With its frank discussion of intercourse,  childbirth and lesbianism, detailed drawings of genitals and compelling first-person accounts, the book has been a medical bible for several generations of women, guiding them from menstruation and motherhood to menopause and mortality. A hallmark of feminism with four million English copies distributed worldwide, its language has been strident, its approach strictly secular and its belief in individual rights unyielding.</p>
        <p>Now, in a new Spanish-language edition intended for a growing Hispanic population, ''Our Bodies, Ourselves'' is emphasizing mutual help over self-help and a woman's need to take care of herself so she can better care for others. Religion is acknowledged for the first time and even the book's new title, ''Nuestros Cuerpos, Nuestras Vidas'' -- or, ''Our Bodies, Our Lives'' -- was recast to reflect interdependence instead of individualism.</p>
        <p>''In Latin culture, relationships come first,'' said Ester Shapiro Rok, the project's coordinating editor and a University of Massachusetts psychologist of Cuban-Jewish descent. ''The individualistic focus of North American feminism is not in keeping with the views of many women of color that their whole society is what's most important.''</p>
        <p>By taking into account cultural differences, the new adaptation, released this spring by Seven Stories Press of New York, has changed as much as half of a book widely regarded as an icon. But the revisions are being embraced by even the original authors, the Boston Women's Health Book Collective, and may find their way into the next English edition.</p>
        <p>''I think we did not feel as passionately militant 30 years later,'' said Judy Norsigian, one of the collective's founders and its program director. ''The Latin American feminists have been almost ahead of us in terms of getting men involved.''</p>
        <p>''Our Bodies, Ourselves'' was published in Spanish in 1976 and 50,000 copies were distributed in other countries, many given away through charities and social service agencies. But it never caught on among Hispanics in the United States, in part, Ms. Shapiro and others suggested, because Latinas often regard Anglo-American women as self-centered. The book continues to be updated and reprinted in a dozen languages; new editions are under way in Bulgaria, Serbia, Indonesia and Armenia.</p>
        <p>When the authors decided the time was right for a new Spanish edition, they realized they needed more than a direct translation.</p>
        <p>The 10-year effort has resulted in a 604-page book that reflects not only cultural differences but also the evolution of feminism, Ms. Norsigian said. ''There's no question we now want to involve men more in many of the problems that are women's problems at face value but really aren't: AIDS, reproductive rights, infertility, rampant infections. You really have to involve men in the idea of safer sex,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Some chapters were almost entirely rewritten, most notably the one called ''Relationships and Sexuality.''</p>
        <p>''In this country, it's your husband who's the major resource while in Latin America, it's a broad network of biological and extended family,'' Ms. Shapiro said.</p>
        <p>The section on abortion maintains its abortion rights stance, but takes care to emphasize the potential effects of unplanned children on existing children somewhat more than the English version does. It also includes a testimonial from an abortion-rights advocacy group in Mexico. (With the exceptions of Cuba and Puerto Rico, abortion remains illegal throughout Latin America.)</p>
        <p>In other changes, new photographs depict Latinas instead of Anglo-Americans and the original, personal accounts that break up the book's scientific information have been replaced with those of Hispanic women.  Several authorities on Hispanic women's health said ''Nuestros Cuerpos'' should be well received because of the crucial role women play in obtaining medical help for their families and the dearth of information available in Spanish.</p>
        <p>Paying respect to the cultural cornerstones of faith and family should also help the book's acceptance, said Dr. Jane L. Delgado, a clinical psychologist, who is president and chief executive of the National Alliance for Hispanic Health, a nonprofit network of Hispanic health providers.</p>
        <p>''For us, health was never broken up into different things -- it was always integrated with body, mind and spirit,'' Dr. Delgado said. ''So that was a real problem for them.''</p>
        <p>One Message, Two Interpretations</p>
        <p>Following are excerpts comparing ''Our Bodies, Ourselves'' with a translation of ''Nuestros Cuerpos, Nuestras Vidas'' provided by its editors:  OUR BODIES: Meditation gives us the opportunity to commune and connect with our inner selves.  NUESTROS CUERPOS: Prayer and meditation are two ways we can calm our minds and bodies while we unite our energies with the celestial energies in which we believe.  OUR BODIES: Our ability to protect our reproductive and sexual health, and to control whether and when we have children, is critical to our freedom -- both to shape our lives and to express and enjoy our sexuality. . . .</p>
        <p>This unit discusses birth control and abortion: the two major tools available to women who have sex with men and do not want to have children right now.  NUESTROS CUERPOS: As women, our bodies have the capacity to create new life. This responsibility and privilege unites us with all our surroundings in an intimate relationship with the tides and the moon, with the family and the community, with society and culture, and with the spiritual. The ability to choose how many children we wish to have, and what time in our lives we wish to dedicate to their care, assures us a healthy future for all. Precisely because we value so highly the sacred seed of life, we take so seriously the conditions for life's unfolding.</p>
        <p>BOOKS ON HEALTH  Correction:  June 24, 2000, Saturday  An article in Science Times on June 13 about the book ''Nuestros Cuerpos, Nuestras Vidas,'' a Latina version of the women's health book ''Our Bodies, Ourselves'' imprecisely characterized comments by Dr. Jane L. Delgado, president and chief executive of the National Alliance for Hispanic Health, a nonprofit network of Hispanic health providers. Dr. Delgado said that in saying that a book's acceptance should be helped by paying respect to the cultural cornerstones of faith and family, she was referring to her own book, ''Sa-lud!''a guide to health for Hispanic women, not to ''Nuestros Cuerpos, Nuestras Vidas.''</p>
