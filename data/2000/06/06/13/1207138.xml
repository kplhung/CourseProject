        <p>Peter J Riga letter on June 10 article calls for rise in estate tax exemption, not repeal of tax</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>President Clinton's promise to veto the total repeal of the estate tax is well taken, and the average citizen should realize that it is to his benefit that he does so (front page, June 10).</p>
        <p>Clearly, some reform is needed. A small business should not have to be liquidated to pay estate taxes. But a more moderate exemption of, say, $5 million, as opposed to the present $675,000 and the $1 million set for 2006, would cover the vast majority of Americans. Anything more would be a windfall for the rich.</p>

        <p>We can use that money for care and nursing for the elderly, paying down the debt, for education and for shoring up Social Security to benefit the vast majority of Americans.</p>
        <p>In addition, those amounts lost to the regular budget would have to be made up by other sources of taxation. This burden would be placed upon us in additional taxation.</p>
