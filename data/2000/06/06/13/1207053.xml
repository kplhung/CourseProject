        <p>There is little rest for the weary on the tennis circuit, little time to digest before it's time to dig into another rich meal.</p>
        <p>Two weeks separate the French Open from Wimbledon. It would, of course, be better if the gap were longer, because the grass-court game requires a set of skills different from the clay-court game.</p>
        <p>A longer gap would also give French Open champions a better chance of catching their breath. In the last 25 years, only Martina Navratilova and Steffi Graf have won at Roland Garros and Wimbledon in the same year, and no man has managed it since Bjorn Borg in 1980.</p>
        <p>One can only imagine how spent Gustavo Kuerten must feel at the moment, even with his remarkable powers of recuperation. To win his second title in Paris, he had to play for 19 hours 13 minutes: an average of close to three hours a match. Along the way, he came from behind to win two five-set matches and got the chance to form a special bond with Per Bastholt, the trainer who hustled on the court to attend to Kuerten's various aches and pains throughout the tournament.</p>
        <p>Mary Pierce earned approximately $600,000 for her victory; Kuerten approximately $30,000 more. But neither had any shortage of capital before arriving in the French capital. What their emotional victories really gave them was credibility.</p>
        <p>Pierce came to prominence in 1994 when women's tennis was reeling from the Monica Seles stabbing and Martina Hingis was 13 years old and busy winning the junior events at the Grand Slam tournaments. After Pierce won the Australian Open in 1995, she advanced past the quarterfinals only once in her next 19 Grand Slam appearances. She was too erratic, too ungainly, too emotionally brittle.</p>
        <p>Now she has won a second title, beating the best competition available on clay: Seles in the quarterfinals; Hingis in the semifinals; and Conchita Martinez in the final. Seles, Hingis and Martinez all won major clay-court events in the weeks before the French Open. So did Pierce, but in her final two warm-up tournaments she seemed typically edgy and off form with the biggest date on her calendar looming.</p>
        <p>Yet once in Paris, Pierce powered through all the bad karma, and she did so because she is not just a power player anymore.</p>
        <p>She has improved all aspects of her game in the last three years, with the help of her former coach, Michael de Jongh, and her new coach, her younger brother David, who began working with her at her request in February.</p>
        <p>With the help of a deeper religious faith and her companion, Cleveland Indians second baseman Roberto Alomar, Pierce has also begun to project more calm and positive energy under duress: smiling more often than groaning when her huge shots go awry and eliminating most of the nervous tics that used to make her preparation to serve look more like preparation for a night on the town. (Hair in place? Check. Dress in place? Check.)</p>
        <p>''She learned a lot from me,'' Hingis said with a laugh after winning the women's doubles title with Pierce on Sunday. ''She's getting dangerous.''</p>
        <p>But Hingis and Lindsay Davenport, who has recovered enough from her back problems to take a wild card into next week's grass-court tuneup in Eastbourne, still lead the rankings by a sizable margin. Pierce is now third; Martinez fourth.</p>
        <p>As for the men, who have radically altered their ranking system this year, Kuerten now leads the yearlong points race, followed by the Swede he beat here in the final, Magnus Norman, followed by Yevgeny Kafelnikov and by Andre Agassi, who has recovered enough from his foot blisters to take a wild card into this week's grass-court tuneup at Queens Club.</p>
        <p>Though Agassi still holds two of the four Grand Slam titles, that pecking order seems an accurate reflection of current form. Agassi has not come close to winning a tournament since the Australian Open in January, although he has played wonderfully in two rounds of Davis Cup for the United States.</p>
        <p>Kuerten has now won three titles this year, and though he remains a clay-court master who may never win a Grand Slam title elsewhere than at Roland Garros, his improved serve and improved results on other surfaces make him No. 1 for now. It remains to be seen if he will make it past the first week at Wimbledon.</p>
