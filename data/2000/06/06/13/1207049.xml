        <p>When the Nasdaq took a drubbing in April, it drove Jon R. Staenberg to drink, and Mr. Staenberg, a venture capitalist based in Seattle, is taking his colleagues with him.</p>
        <p>The beverage is not alcohol, though, but a ginseng-based energy drink. Mr. Staenberg sent a case to executives at all the companies he helps manage with a sobering message: even with technology stocks regaining their footing, start-ups that had hoped to go public quickly or get new private financing should tap their own energy instead.</p>
        <p>The last several years have been a boom time for venture capitalists. But April's plunge was scary, and instead of taking a flier on just about any plausible idea out there venture capital firms are re-emphasizing grunt work -- shepherding companies through the difficult early stages, refining business models, building value.</p>
        <p>''Fear,'' Mr. Staenberg said, ''has replaced greed.''</p>
        <p>The fear, or reality check, is that traditional economic rules have returned just when many start-ups were acting as if those rules had been suspended. It used to be that growth was all, and profits an expendable luxury.</p>
        <p>But with the public markets closed -- at least temporarily -- to many start-ups, venture capitalists are urging executives to plan for a future in which new capital will not appear overnight.</p>
        <p>Companies must show clear business models -- and quicker profits. Indeed, between April 14 and last Thursday, 71 companies pulled public offerings, more than double any other two-month period in the previous two years, according to IPO.com, which tracks this market. Dozens of venture firms, including the top-tier firms and investment arms of major financial institutions, have found they must wait indefinitely for returns that seemed so sure months ago.</p>
        <p>And as they wait for the window to reopen, venture capitalists are making sure their investments stay alive -- a process that means overseeing cost-cutting, up to and including layoffs.</p>
        <p>Linuxcare, a San Francisco consulting company backed by Kleiner Perkins, Caufield &amp; Byers, planned an offering for early March, then for April, but has now put it off indefinitely. On May 3, it laid off 70 of its 270 employees.</p>
        <p>Ted E. Schlein, a general partner at Kleiner Perkins and chairman of Linuxcare, said the company was in solid shape before the layoffs, but needed to be ready if the markets remained closed.</p>
        <p>''We grew the burn rate in anticipation of being a public company,'' he said, referring to the rate at which the company spent its cash reserves. ''If there's a public offering, great. If not, let's plan for it.''</p>
        <p>But even as venture capitalists shepherd old companies, they continue to finance some promising new ones, too. The reason is that they have billions in their combined coffers to invest, thanks to record-breaking first-quarter fund-raising, according to figures released today by the National Venture Capital Association and Thomson Financial Securities Data.</p>
        <p>Their study put contributions to 100 venture firms at $12.4 billion, up 85 percent from last year's first quarter. As a result, venture capitalists said they were investing at a slightly slower pace because they were spending time on existing investments.</p>
        <p>Warren Packard, a partner in Draper Fisher Jurvestson Associates, said that before April 15, he spent roughly 75 percent of his time working with companies he had already invested in, and 25 percent looking at new ventures; now, it is more like 85 percent and 15 percent.</p>
        <p>Venture capitalists are still investing, but at a different pace. Mr. Packard said that while he typically made four investments a year, he might make just three this year.</p>
        <p>Like Mr. Schlein, Mr. Packard is working with companies to cut costs, as illustrated by his work with DigitalWork.com, which is based in Chicago and helps small businesses automate tasks like sending out press releases, recruiting employees and building Web sites.</p>
        <p>The company had planned to go public on April 14, the day the Nasdaq took its biggest dip. It postponed the offering, and is considering pulling its filing altogether, said its chairman and chief executive, Rob Schultz.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schultz said that, meanwhile,  he had worked with Mr. Packard and other directors on how to shift gears. The conclusion, he said, was to curtail growth efforts, and seek to be profitable by late 2001, a few quarters ahead of schedule.</p>
        <p>He noted that the company had around $30 million in reserves, plenty for now, though he declined to say how fast it was spending that cash.</p>
        <p>One suggestion Mr. Packard had was that DigitalWork alter the way it uses its resources. Rather than emphasize signing on new partners, he suggested trying to get more out of existing partnerships, like a deal with Office Depot that features kiosks promoting DigitalWork.</p>
        <p>In all, the company has 65 such partnerships, and Mr. Schultz said it would not turn to new partnerships unless the opportunity was ''phenomenal.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Packard said he worked with companies to help them survive longer on existing capital, to see that ''Plan A'' -- to go public quickly -- may not be a reality.</p>
        <p>''All our companies are just dusting off Plan B,'' he said; he counsels them to delay offerings a year or two. ''Instead of a sprint, it's become a marathon.''</p>
        <p>Similarly, Mr. Staenberg coaches companies to find alternative strategies. He is working with one to find merger partners, and is shopping another as an acquisition candidate.</p>
        <p>Matthew Cowan, a principal at Bowman Capital, which makes late-stage, or ''mezzanine level,'' financing in the months just before an offering, said his company was putting new focus on enterprises it had already financed rather than putting its money exclusively in new ventures.</p>
        <p>Financiers and industry observers, meanwhile, say the type of new company being sought out is changing -- and was doing so even before April. Business-to-consumer and, to a lesser degree, business-to-business companies are out of favor, while wireless and optical networking technology are in vogue, said Sasha Talebi, research director of VentureOne, a market research firm in San Francisco.</p>
        <p>One company that canceled a June offering but is still getting overtures is the Intira Corporation, in Pleasanton, Calif. Intira operates data and network centers for companies on an outsourcing basis, and burns through $9 million a month, said Bernie Schneider, the chief executive.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schneider said Intira, already backed by Chase Capital Partners,  among others, had been approached by at least two other parties asking if the company ''is interested in raising private equity.''</p>
        <p>''There's probably more money available than at any point in '99,'' said Mr. Schneider, who hopes to attract $100 million in new cash. ''But the market has to be a good one, the business model has to be a good one, and the management is coming under more scrutiny.''</p>
        <p>VentureOne reports one indication that financing will continue at a healthy pace: despite the market downturn, venture capitalists still have large stores of cash available.</p>
        <p>Indeed, in the first quarter of this year, venture capitalists raised $9.8 billion, compared with $4.6 billion for the comparable 1999 period, the firm said, apparently supporting the trend seen in today's figures. Venture capitalists say there are tens of billions of dollars in their coffers they still need to invest, even though they have been investing money within 18 months of raising it, more than twice as fast as they used to.</p>
        <p>Whether the amount of available capital will keep growing is a different question. Financiers say they are seeing some slowing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Staenberg, who manages roughly $100 million in assets, said that before April 14 he had begun to raise money for a new fund and found the response overwhelmingly positive. But after that, he said, many investors pulled back, leaving him about half what he had anticipated. He declined to disclose the size of the fund.</p>
        <p>''People told me, 'I know I said I was going to invest X amount, but would you consider a quarter or a half of that?' '' he said. Some investors asked if he would leave room for them to invest more later.</p>
        <p>Mr. Staenberg cited two reasons for the pullback: investors do not have as much to invest, and they are reassessing what percent of their assets to allocate to technology-related deals, asking, ''Have we gone too far, too fast?''</p>
        <p>Similarly, Mr. Packard said the firm recently completed the second stage of fund-raising for a global Internet fund. He said the fund was at $650 million, or 10 to 20 percent less than it might have been.</p>
        <p>Venture capitalists, meanwhile,  have been investing at a record pace. During the first quarter, financiers at 900 firms, all with at least $20 million under management, poured $17.8 billion into 1,040 start-ups, both record figures, according to VentureOne.</p>
        <p>No wonder, given that the returns have been other-worldly in the last year. The US Venture Capital Index, compiled by Cambridge Associates, a Boston market research firm, found that during 1999, American venture firms together had a 279 percent rise in value of their investments. (That represents the value of those investments, some of which remain private, not the actual amount returned to investors.)</p>
        <p>The 1999 figure compares with 27 percent in 1998 and 37 percent in 1997, also high by traditional standards.</p>
        <p>In fact, Cambridge Associates found that in the late 1980's and early 1990's, annual returns were much humbler, with limited partners experiencing gains of 3.1 percent in 1988, 6.8 percent in 1989, and 2.3 percent in 1990.</p>
        <p>Indeed, as many venture capitalists have said all along, their trade has been made to look far easier in recent years than it may prove to be over the long haul. In large part, this is because the public markets no longer embrace every new technology offering without first checking under the hood.</p>
        <p>''Companies that previously could expect to have a funding around every six months, now have got to operate under the assumption it might take one and a half or two years,'' said Mr. Talebi of Venture-One.</p>
        <p>''The returns in this business have outweighed the risks,'' said Sean Foote, a principal in Labrador Ventures, of Redwood City, Calif. ''Now the risk has gone way up because there is no place to flip those companies to anymore.''</p>
