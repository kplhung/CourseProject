        <p>TOO many times you have walked into an Upper West Side apartment (or a suburban split-level, for that matter) and had that sinking feeling: the Georgia O'Keeffe print, the turquoise and salmon throw pillows, the Navajo rug. Southwest wannabe strikes again!</p>

        <p>TOO many times you have walked into an Upper West Side apartment (or a suburban split-level, for that matter) and had that sinking feeling: the Georgia O'Keeffe print, the turquoise and salmon throw pillows, the Navajo rug. Southwest wannabe strikes again!</p>
        <p>But now, the Upper West Side apartment of James S. Liebman, who actually is from New Mexico, a homesick man who recreates the soul of the place. The apartment is full of summer light, orderly, serene, a cactus here and there, with a few good pieces of weathered furniture. The phone jangles constantly; he remains placidly impervious.</p>
        <p>It's the home of a man who can step slowly back from startled rattlers, has taught his young children how to be patient if they happen upon bears, and who is an uncluttered thinker, capable of spending a decade sifting through thousands of American death penalty cases for a study, released yesterday, that is rattling both sides of the capital punishment debate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Liebman, a professor at Columbia Law School, and his team found that between 1973 and 1995, state and federal courts overturned two out of three death sentences, usually because defense lawyers were incompetent or prosecutors withheld evidence favorable to the defense.</p>
        <p>Therefore?</p>
        <p>Spin one: the system works, because it catches mistakes.</p>
        <p>Spin two: the system is a catastrophe, because it makes so many mistakes in the first place.</p>
        <p>''I'm sweating bullets about how people are going to read this,'' Mr. Liebman says. ''It can be misused by just about everybody, because it's a complex study of a complex system.''</p>
        <p>His reading -- spin two -- comes as no surprise. He has worked on a dozen death penalty appeals, argued four before the Supreme Court (won three), stuck by one death row client for 20 years, and is an author of a 1,500-page treatise on habeas corpus, the last-ditch appeal in federal court. It's a must-read road map for the imprisoned and desperate.</p>
        <p>In his universe, it's a best seller: about 2,000 copies a year. ''We try to make it intelligible to prisoners, and we don't always succeed,'' he says wryly. ''As I tell my students, if you think habeas corpus works one way, you know a lot about it, because it works just the opposite way.''</p>
        <p>That work caught the attention of aides to the Senate Judiciary Committee, who called him in 1991, as legislators were talking about cutting back federal review. What impact would new laws have on death penalty cases? they asked. And so began Mr. Liebman's journey.</p>
        <p>Mr. Liebman, 47, who has hiked volcanoes and traveled with his wife, Janet Sabel, a Legal Aid lawyer, to such rough-going places as Irian Jaya and Sulawesi, and to remote areas of Guatemala, Peru and Bolivia, is used to a little chaos. The longer he hiked into the remote areas of death penalty litigation, the thornier the trip became.</p>
        <p>HIS premise -- that federal courts detect most of the cases where errors occurred in state trials -- turned out to be wrong. State courts, as it happened, catch most of the problems. But those state courts miss plenty of troubled cases, Mr. Liebman found, underscoring the importance of yet another look by a federal court. Meanwhile, 10 years usually elapsed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Liebman connects the dots from the day in 1979 when, as a baby lawyer, having just descended from the egghead kingdom -- Yale, Stanford law review, prestigious clerkships on the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and the Supreme Court -- he was asked by his boss at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund to figure out this habeas corpus stuff. It had been six years since capital punishment had been reintroduced in America, and death penalty appeals were trickling in.</p>
        <p>''I got into this first as an abstraction,'' he says, ''then I was dealing with individuals themselves on death row. Now I'm looking at the system, thinking mostly as a citizen about what the government is doing on my behalf, spending millions of dollars to fix mistakes.''</p>
        <p>A lawyer-scholar, Mr. Liebman says he really likes writing footnotes, and calls himself an introvert. ''But my son will talk to anyone,'' he adds, lighting up. ''I think that's so cool!''</p>
        <p>As a child in Albuquerque, he often performed on stage. ''Acting is filled with introverts,'' he says, ''because you get to be somebody else.''</p>
        <p>It was also in Albuquerque that he acquired his passions for the outdoors and, as a Jew living in a Native American- and Mexican-inflected culture, for diverse communities.</p>
        <p>''I'm a total integrationist,'' adds Mr. Liebman, the lead lawyer on an eight-month desegregation trial in the mid-80's that resulted in $2 billion being poured into urban Kansas City, Mo., schools.</p>
        <p>Last month, that system was stripped of accreditation. Meaningful reform of public schools, like overhauling capital punishment, twin causes that have animated Mr. Liebman's career, strike most people as hopeless.</p>
        <p>He smiles quietly. He is often accused of optimism.</p>
        <p>To answer, he points to a beautiful sculpture on the floor, a delicate balancing of simple wooden blocks, built by his 5-year-old daughter. Just then, a vagrant breeze sends a few clattering. A visitor expresses dismay.</p>
        <p>Not to worry, he says. ''She tries all these things and they fall down, but it doesn't faze her,'' he explains. ''She'll just try again.''</p>
        <p>PUBLIC LIVES  Correction:  June 14, 2000, Wednesday  A Public Lives profile yesterday about the main author of the study, and an edi torial yesterday about capital punishment, included other erroneous references t o the finding. It covered only those death sentences that were appealed, not all  death sentences.</p>
        <p>The Monday article and the editorial also misstated the year that the Supreme C ourt reinstated the death penalty. After overturning death penalty laws in 1972,  the court began to reinstate revised versions in 1976. Some that were approved by the court had been redrafted in 1973, but the court did not reinstate the pen alty that year.</p>
        <p>The Monday article included an erroneous percentage from a draft of the study, for capital cases in which state courts found error. It was 47 percent, not 46.</p>
