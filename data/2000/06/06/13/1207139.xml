        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Too Much in Touch,'' by William Safire (column, June 8):</p>
        <p>I, too, would like to be left alone, insulated not from humanity but from the incessant loud voices used by cell phone users. It is almost as if the person at the other end of the phone is extremely hard of hearing; otherwise, why must the person shout?</p>
        <p>Mr. Safire might also have mentioned what some perceive as a safety problem when these same people use their phones as they drive -- particularly those big sport utility vehicles. In this case, they do not bother anyone, except any passengers in the car, but do pose a potential threat to other drivers.</p>
        <p>Personally, I look forward to silence. My theory is: If someone wants to speak to me, he or she will manage to find me sooner or later.</p>
