        <p>'And the Legend Continues'  Katherine Dunham  Symphony Space</p>
        <p>Sadly, the seldom-seen dances of Katherine Dunham are becoming an endangered species, though her influence remains strong. Ms. Dunham, now 91, has continued her work training children in East St. Louis, Ill., where she lives. Out of that hard, bitter ground, with its history of extreme poverty, she has developed young dancers who have not only mastered her demanding technique but who know how to light up a stage with their performing. That was the message of ''And the Legend Continues,'' presented by Dr. Glory Van Scott on Saturday night.</p>

        <p>'And the Legend Continues'  Katherine Dunham  Symphony Space</p>
        <p>Sadly, the seldom-seen dances of Katherine Dunham are becoming an endangered species, though her influence remains strong. Ms. Dunham, now 91, has continued her work training children in East St. Louis, Ill., where she lives. Out of that hard, bitter ground, with its history of extreme poverty, she has developed young dancers who have not only mastered her demanding technique but who know how to light up a stage with their performing. That was the message of ''And the Legend Continues,'' presented by Dr. Glory Van Scott on Saturday night.</p>
        <p>The bare-bones production offered too little a glimpse of the glories of some signature Dunham dances. But Dr. Van Scott is one of dance's most persuasive producers, an uncommon blend of knowledge, devotion and theatrical savvy, and predictably enough the program made its points vividly.</p>
        <p>The children, 6 to 18 years old, offered a clear suggestion of the technique in a series of increasingly complex diagonal stage crosses. The 1937 ''Rara Tonga'' was among the other highlights, based on a Melanesian folk tale and filled with delicate arm and hand gestures performed with lilting sweetness by Heather Beal and three unidentified corps women. Theo Jamison was nicely implacable as the jealous husband, with Jared Brown as a somewhat mystified-looking god.</p>
        <p>Another treasure was Ms. Dunham's 1942 ''Cakewalk,'' a vibrant slice of American dance and social history that was danced to perfection by a cast led by Jillian Jones, Ms. Beal, a powerfully funky Mr. Brown, Maia Chapman and Jeshon Green. The exquisitely detailed costumes for ''Cakewalk'' were originals by the greatly gifted John Pratt, whose shell-like white ruches for ''Rara Tonga'' say it all.</p>
        <p>The dances were reconstructed by Ruby Steate, artistic director of the company. The fine Dunham drummers were led by James Belk. The evening ended with reminiscences by Ms. Dunham, as witty and humane as ever, on everything from computers to a hunger for dance.</p>
