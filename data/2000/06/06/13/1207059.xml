        <p>The leader of the State Senate today proposed a measure that calls for tighter restrictions on how politicians raise money in New York. In doing so, he lifted his longstanding opposition to altering the state's much-maligned campaign finance laws and acknowledged problems in the current system.</p>
        <p>But Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican majority leader, waited until the last scheduled week of the Legislature's session to release his proposal, making it extremely difficult for any compromise to be reached on the issue before lawmakers head home for summer vacation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bruno's proposal seeks to impose changes on a system that has remained largely unchanged since the Watergate era, even though politicians have become skillful at finding ways to skirt the existing finance laws with little threat of serious penalty.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bruno's proposal would require increased public disclosure of campaign contributions, step up enforcement of campaign finance rules and increase penalties for violations. It would also introduce a limit on so-called soft money donations to political parties, donations that have been used to skirt limits on contributions to individual candidates.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bruno's bill would not impose any reductions in contribution limits for candidates, as bills proposed by Gov. George E. Pataki and Democratic leaders of the State Assembly would. Nor would it ban so-called soft money contributions, as other proposal would.</p>
        <p>The Republicans who control the Senate have been reluctant to overhaul the state's campaign finance laws in recent years, maintaining that current law is adequate and asserting that the state should not interfere with the ability of people to give money to candidates. But in releasing his proposal, Mr. Bruno said he was seeking to fulfill a pledge he made earlier this year.</p>
        <p>''This is a comprehensive package of reforms and contains elements of campaign finance bills introduced by Governor Pataki and the Assembly,'' he said. ''This legislation keeps the commitment I made to address concerns raised about the state's campaign finance laws and bolster public confidence in our political system.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bruno's decision to reveal his proposal in the waning days of the Legislature's session led Democrats to accuse him of trying merely to  defuse criticism in a year in which he and his Republican colleagues in the Senate face re-election. The Democrats said Mr. Bruno had no genuine interest in overhauling the current system, noting that he is one of the Legislature's most formidable fund-raisers.</p>
        <p>''This is an end-of-session ploy by Mr. Bruno,'' said Alexander B. Grannis, a Democrat in the Assembly and one of the main sponsors of his chamber's proposal to change the campaign finance system. ''If he had any interest in meaningful campaign finance reform, he had months to do that.''</p>
        <p>But aides to Mr. Bruno dismissed such attacks as partisanship, adding that the criticism did nothing to advance the issue of campaign finance reform in Albany. The aides also said that Mr. Bruno hoped the Legislature would address the issue before it adjourned.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bruno received some words of support from several groups that have called for changes in the finance system, though they, too, expressed concerns about the timing.</p>
        <p>Blair Horner, the legislative coordinator for the New York Public Interest Research Group, said that the proposal had a few provisions that were worthy. He also said that Mr. Bruno's entry into the debate removed the last major impediment to change.</p>
        <p>''The good news is that Senator Bruno has finally put a campaign finance proposal on the table,'' Mr. Horner said. ''But the bad news is that he is disclosing his plan at the last minute.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bruno's bill would limit soft-money donations to $76,500 a year. But critics say the provision is meaningless, noting that only a handful of contributors make soft-money donations approaching that size.</p>
        <p>The term soft money refers to unrestricted donations made to political parties for activities like issue advertising and get-out-the-vote drives. Unlike other donations to parties, soft money is not subject to contribution limits, allowing wealthy individuals and corporations who have already given the maximum under the finance limits to give more.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bruno's bill also attempts to regulate political advertisements paid for by advocacy groups during campaigns, one of the most complicated areas of campaign finance. The bill would require such groups to publicly disclose information about themselves, as well as the amount they have spent on advertising.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bruno's bill would also require campaigns to disclose more about their donors, including the names of their employers and their occupations. That would make it easier to determine the interests supporting each politician.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bruno called for tougher civil penalties for violations of campaign finance rules, increasing the fines to $1,500 from $500. In addition, his bill would increase criminal penalties from a misdemeanor to a felony. But whether the new penalties would make a difference is uncertain, since the Board of Elections, the agency that enforces campaign finance rules, is controlled by the two major parties.</p>
