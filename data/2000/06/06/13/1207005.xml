        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Syria's Leader Assad Dies, Clouding Mideast Prospects'' (front page, June 11):</p>
        <p>When considering the legacy of President Hafez al-Assad, one has to remember that we are dealing with a man who leveled half a city of his own people, Hama, killing 10,000 civilians, in part to make a point about how dissent would be treated. He played with civilians' lives along the Israeli-Lebanese border for decades by financing Hezbollah. And although he transformed Syria into a Middle East power broker, the pan-Arabism that formed the base of his world view had the annihilation of Israel and Western influence as its prime application.</p>
        <p>If Osama bin Laden were to die tomorrow, the American secretary of state would not be rushing to his funeral. The fact that in this case the terrorist leader happened to have seized and held a country for 30 years should not change anything.</p>
