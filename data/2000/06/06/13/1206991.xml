        <p>The yellow-nosed albatross that apparently took a wrong turn in the Southern Hemisphere and has been delighting birders along the East Coast has turned up again, back in New England.</p>
        <p>First spotted last month flying over Penikese Island in Buzzard's Bay, Mass., the large, oceangoing bird turned up the next week on the outer beach of Fire Island National Seashore and then, remarkably, was seen on May 21 flying along the Garden State Parkway.</p>
        <p>Two days later it turned up on the New Jersey shore of Delaware Bay and on nearby beaches, where dozens of birders were able to observe it. Then the bird (or birds, for it is impossible to say for sure that there is only one) vanished.</p>
        <p>All was quiet until June 4, when Scott Tsagarakis, an amateur birder, was shocked to find a yellow-nosed albatross flying over a coastal pond at Trustom National Wildlife Refuge in South Kingstown, R.I. He got a good look before the bird, under assault by crows, headed back out to sea.</p>
        <p>The next day, Dan Sutherland, a photographer on Nantucket, was taken aback while repairing shingles on a house at Tom Nevers Head to see a giant bird coming in eye-level from the ocean. It was an adult yellow-nosed albatross. The bird flew over a grassy field and then headed back out over the Atlantic.</p>
        <p>Though not unheard of, the yellow-nosed albatross, whose wingspan can reach seven feet, is a real rarity in the North Atlantic.</p>
        <p>Where is it now? Who knows.</p>
