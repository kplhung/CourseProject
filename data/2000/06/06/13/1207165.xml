        <p>GERSEN-Sylvia on June 11, 2000. We shared a life for over 50 years. Reaching the Millennium as she attained the age of 90 was an unexpected bonus. The oft repeated characterization of a gallant dispute with cancer was literally true in her case. We even spent the night before her brain surgery at the ballet, putting a period to a lifelong passion for music and the dance. Straightforward, unduly modest, unaware of the extent of her talents and the generosity of her spirit, without pretense or display, a lady of grace, elegance and gentility, she merited and to an extent unrecognized by her, achieved the respect, admiration and love of those who knew her best. Nothing became her life as much as the way she met her death. She leaves a desperately bereaved husband whose life she guided and immeasurably enriched, nieces Marilyn Gans, Betty Katsner and Peggy Clark who were especially dear to her, Betty Lenson, the widow of her beloved younger brother Martin, grandnieces of whom she was fond, and a host of friends &amp; acquaintances. Burial was private. A memorial service will be held on Thursday, June 15, 2000, 3:30 PM at Frank E. Campbell Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue, New York.</p>
