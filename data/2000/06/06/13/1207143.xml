        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>History has shown that technological toothpaste cannot be put back in the tube. Even if the United States were able to develop a successful missile shield (letters, June 6), that technical feat would soon be within the ability of other countries, including the so-called rogue states.</p>
        <p>The resulting feeling by those countries that they are invulnerable to counterattack would truly pose a greater risk to this country, even destabilize the entire world.</p>
        <p>Deterrence has worked for more than 50 years. There is no reason to give up on it now.</p>
