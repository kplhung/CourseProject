        <p>AIDS will have a particularly insidious effect on the work force over the next two decades, not only reducing its size but causing an increase in child laborers, moonlighting parents, job absenteeism and retraining costs, the International Labor Organization says in its first report on the workplace impact of the AIDS epidemic.</p>
        <p>The report was released during the recently concluded annual meeting in Geneva of the I.L.O., a United Nations specialized agency. According to the report, most of the effect will be felt in sub-Saharan Africa, the region most affected by AIDS. By some estimates, the region is home to 80 percent of those worldwide infected by H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS.</p>
        <p>The report said the consequences of a reduced work force would probably mean a rise in working children, particularly orphans whose parents have died or been incapacitated by AIDS. The study also projected increased absenteeism from sicknesses associated with AIDS and added difficulties in recruiting.</p>
        <p>Some employers in Africa, the report said, had already started hiring two or three people to be trained for the same job, partly because ''it is feared that employees in key positions may be lost due to AIDS.''</p>
        <p>In the next 20 years, because of the devastation caused by AIDS to workers between 20 and 49, the average age of the work force is likely to decrease by at least two years, said the I.L.O. report, titled ''HIV/AIDS: A threat to decent work, productivity and development.'' The report represents the first time the agency has tracked and made projections about the effect of AIDS on the workplace.</p>
        <p>''There is an admittedly belated, yet growing understanding that H.I.V./AIDS is very much a problem for the world of work,'' the report said. ''The numbers of workers with H.I.V./AIDS have, or will, depending on the country, become a major cause for concern for all employers, in enterprises and organization of all sizes.''</p>
        <p>According to the report, by 2015, the population of 29 African countries is expected to reach 698 million, or 61 million fewer than the total would have been without the spread of AIDS.</p>
        <p>In countries with the highest prevalence of the disease -- Botswana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Uganda and Zimbabwe -- there will be 11.5 million fewer people in the labor market by 2020 than there would otherwise have been.</p>
