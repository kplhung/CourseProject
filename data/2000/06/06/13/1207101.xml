        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As an attending physician in the intensive care unit, I am confronted with the reality of dying on a daily basis (''Planning for Death,'' May 29 and 30). While physicians may sometimes fail to adequately address the needs of dying patients, exposing them to needless suffering, often the physician is the one that initiates the discussion on withdrawing care and allowing for a dignified death, not the barrier to the process.</p>
        <p>While many families allow their loved ones to die in peace, it is not uncommon for relatives to force the medical staff to continue aggressive life support long after hope of recovery has gone. Often there is division among family members, with a history of family dysfunction being played out in the face of an impending death.</p>

        <p>Sometimes, families will ignore the stated wish of relative not to be subjected to such treatments.</p>
        <p>Much of the time, physicians can heal the sick. But when we cannot, please allow us to comfort the dying.</p>
