        <p>A well-danced program by American Ballet Theater on Thursday night ended with choreographic fireworks when a new set of soloists led ''Etudes,'' Harald Lander's dazzling tribute to ballet training and technique.</p>
        <p>''Etudes,'' a long ballet, is fun to watch. Yet it is filled with perils for dancers, for in a desire to impress audiences, they may succumb to the temptation to expend all their energy too soon, leaving them obviously breathless before the work is over.</p>
        <p>Gillian Murphy, in the ballerina role, wisely calculated her interpretation so that the work's progression from lyricism to brilliance had the effect of a choreographic crescendo.</p>
        <p>The two major male roles offer two views of the possibilities of male dancing: one man must be gallant, the other ebullient. Making his debut in the gallant part, Carlos Molina moved smoothly like a true cavalier. Cast in the other role, Angel Corella made virtuosity look like fun.</p>
        <p>Julie Kent and Robert Hill offered a vivid interpretation of the first-act pas de deux from Kenneth MacMillan's ''Manon.'' The sequence depicts the love scene that follows after the ballet's heroine and Des Grieux, a former seminary student, have impulsively run off together. The way Ms. Kent and Mr. Hill rushed headlong at each other and then sank ecstatically to the floor turned the duet into choreographic images of mounting passion.</p>
        <p>There were also attractive repeat performances of Robert Joffrey's ''Pas des Deesses'' and Martha Graham's ''Diversion of Angels.''</p>
        <p>David Lamarche, the conductor, paid careful attention to the musical style of each work. In ''Etudes,'' for instance, there are moments when Knudaage Riisager, the composer, deliberately has sections of the orchestra play in different keys. Insensitively conducted, these phrases can resemble jumbles of wrong notes. Mr. Lamarche made their discordant harmonies sound piquant.</p>
