        <p>The public relations effort to save the life of a Texas death row inmate scheduled for execution next week escalated today as his cause was taken up by the Northwestern University center whose work has helped exonerate nine death row inmates in Illinois.</p>
        <p>Lawrence C. Marshall, legal director for the Center on Wrongful Convictions, called on the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles and Gov. George W. Bush to stop the June 22 execution of the inmate, Gary Graham, and order a new trial. Noting that Mr. Graham had been convicted largely on the testimony of one witness, Mr. Marshall held a news conference with 11 people wrongly convicted because of erroneous witness testimony. All 11 are now free; 3 had been on death row, in Florida, Illinois and Maryland.</p>

        <p>The public relations effort to save the life of a Texas death row inmate scheduled for execution next week escalated today as his cause was taken up by the Northwestern University center whose work has helped exonerate nine death row inmates in Illinois.</p>
        <p>Lawrence C. Marshall, legal director for the Center on Wrongful Convictions, called on the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles and Gov. George W. Bush to stop the June 22 execution of the inmate, Gary Graham, and order a new trial.

All 11 are now free; 3 had been on death row, in Florida, Illinois and Maryland.</p>
        <p>Mr. Graham was sentenced to death for the fatal shooting in May 1981 of 53-year-old Bobby Lambert during an attempted night robbery outside a Houston grocery store. Mr. Graham pleaded guilty to a string of aggravated robberies, but he has maintained his innocence in the Lambert case. No physical evidence links him to the crime.</p>
        <p>His conviction hinged on the testimony of a witness whose account has not wavered in nearly two decades.</p>
