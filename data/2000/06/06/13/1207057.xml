        <p>David Stern is hoping it will one day be called simply ''The D League,'' a place where National Basketball Association hopefuls can better hone their crafts and their lives, a minor league wholly owned and operated by the N.B.A.</p>
        <p>The N.B.A.'s long-term plans for such an entity grew closer to reality today when Stern, the N.B.A. commissioner, and Russ Granik, the deputy commissioner, announced that the National Basketball Development League would begin play in November 2001.</p>
        <p>Specific cities and team names will not be announced until this fall. Granik said players had to be at least 20 years old to compete.</p>
        <p>''Despite a lot of the preliminary comments that this league was somehow going to compete against the colleges or be a parallel path, that's not what we're looking to create,'' Granik said. ''We will have a lot of programs educationally and otherwise for players below a certain age.''</p>
        <p>League officials have already run into obstacles with the National Basketball Players Association over whether the developmental league will be used to ship players down from the N.B.A. ''I understand the union doesn't like the idea of punishing a player by sending him down, particularly a veteran player, but I think you can create a system where there are benefits for everybody,'' Granik said.</p>
        <p>In their annual address at the N.B.A. finals, Stern and Granik also shot down the idea that the league might be considering rule changes to prevent the intentional fouling of Shaquille O'Neal in order to keep sending the poor-free-throw-shooting Lakers center to the line.</p>
        <p>''We're not planning to rush out and enact some Hack-a-Shaq antidote,'' Stern said.</p>
        <p>Stern and Granik also discussed injuries to Grant Hill and Tim Duncan that may prevent the two All-Stars from competing for the United States Olympic team at the Games in Sydney, Australia, in September.</p>
        <p>While Duncan's minor knee surgery was expected to heal in time, Hill's rehabilitation on his surgically repaired foot was expected to force the Pistons' forward to give up his spot. ''I think there's a real chance that, unfortunately, he might not be able to play from what we're hearing,'' Granik said, adding that Kobe Bryant and Eddie Jones were among the possible replacements.</p>
        <p>Stern also discussed attendance problems and declining television ratings two years after Michael Jordan's last season.</p>
        <p>''The marketplace is telling us that outside of the playoffs, people don't associate the N.B.A. regular season with late Saturday afternoon,'' Stern said, regarding the numerous Saturday games televised this past season. ''It's a Sunday sport, and so, we're going to probably halve the number of games on Saturday.''</p>
