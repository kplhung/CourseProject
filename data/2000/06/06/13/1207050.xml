        <p>Amid heated competition in the car insurance business, State Farm, the largest of the insurers, said yesterday that it was giving its customers an unexpected dividend of just over $1 billion.</p>

        <p>Amid heated competition in the car insurance business, State Farm, the largest of the insurers, said yesterday that it was giving its customers an unexpected dividend of just over $1 billion.</p>
        <p>State Farm, a mutual company owned by its policyholders with wide discretion in issuing dividends, said the payout was based on better-than-expected earnings in 1999. But its after-tax profits were actually greater in 1998, and it paid no dividend on those results.</p>
        <p>''It's a very strong marketing tool,'' said Hugo J. Warns III, a Legg Mason analyst in Baltimore.</p>
        <p>State Farm has been losing market share to smaller companies that have been advertising lower prices and some analysts interpreted the dividend -- the biggest ever given by State Farm -- as an attempt to counter that erosion.</p>
        <p>''They're trying to maintain their customer base,'' said Charles Gates, a Credit Suisse First Boston analyst.</p>
        <p>State Farm executives deflected questions about the marketing value of the dividend, but Steve Vogel, the company's chief spokesman, said the dividend would ''obviously make me feel good about being a State Farm policyholder.''</p>
        <p>Payments to individual drivers will range from an average of $15 in New York and many other states to as high as $82 in Connecticut, based on State Farm earnings in those states.  Drivers in New Jersey -- alone among the states -- will receive no dividend, State Farm executives said, because the company, along with all other insurers, sharply reduced rates there last March at the insistence of legislators in Trenton. State Farm cut its rate by 16 percent, one percentage point more than the 15 percent reduction that had been ordered.</p>
        <p>The dividend will be sent to drivers as insurers, including State Farm, are beginning to raise rates after two unusual years in which prices for car insurance dropped.</p>
        <p>State Farm said the $1 billion dividend did not address the rising costs of coverage that are driving rates up again. ''Dividends are a look back,'' said Gary Grant, State Farm's chief actuary.</p>
        <p>State Farm reported net earnings in 1999 of $811.8 million, compared with $1.1 billion in 1998. John Killian, a vice president in finance, said the 1999 dividend was based on pretax earnings of just over $1 billion. He said the company had unrealized investment gains of more than $4 billion in 1998 and 1999, bringing the company's net worth to $45.8 billion. Instead of adding the 1999 profits to the company's coffers, Mr. Grant said, State Farm decided to return the money to its customers.</p>
        <p>State Farm has paid dividends of $169 million to $892 million in 6 of the last 10 years.</p>
        <p>With several big companies raising rates this year, State Farm has continued to cut rates in some states. It has dropped prices in 15 states so far this year but it has also raised them in 10 states. Last year, State Farm cut rates in 48 states and raised them in one.</p>
