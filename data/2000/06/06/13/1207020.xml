        <p>Uncertainty about second-quarter earnings reports helped drag down stock prices yesterday. Computer software makers felt the brunt of investors' displeasure, and the Nasdaq composite index suffered its biggest one-day decline in three weeks.</p>
        <p>Citrix Systems, which adapts Microsoft software for computer networks and was under selling pressure late last week, set the tone early. Before the market opened, Citrix said that its earnings would fall short of Wall Street projections.</p>
        <p>Citrix was the most active stock yesterday and lost almost half its value. It closed at 22 1/4, down 18 15/16 .</p>
        <p>The earnings projection reverberated with technology stocks on the Nasdaq. By the close, the Nasdaq fell 106.93, or 2.8 percent, to 3,767.91. It was the Nasdaq's biggest loss since May 23 and gave back some of the 21 percent gain recorded the last two weeks.</p>
        <p>Declines in big technology names like Cisco Systems, Texas Instruments and Oracle sent the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index down. The S.&amp; P. fell 10.95, or 0.8 percent, to 1,446.</p>
        <p>And the Dow Jones industrial average slipped 49.85, or 0.5 percent, to 10,564.21. Home Depot led the Dow lower on fears that higher interest rates might hurt its earnings.</p>
        <p>''The market is going to be fine over the next six months,'' said John Manley, equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney. ''But over the next 6 to 10 trading days, I am not so sure. The economy is slowing down, which is what the Federal Reserve Board wants, but there is a darker side to that because if that happens, corporate profits will see some disappointments.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Manley said the market would  be on edge about what the Fed does and says after policy makers conclude two days of meetings on June 28. ''I don't think they will raise rates again,'' he said, ''but the verbiage accompanying their decision may be sterner than if they did raise rates. That could be disconcerting, and contribute to a choppy market.''</p>
        <p>Citrix was the most spectacular loser among software makers. But it was not alone.</p>
        <p>Microsoft fell 1 15/16 , to 66 7/8; Computer Associates lost 8 3/8, to 50 13/16 ; and BMC Software dropped 3 1/4, to 41.</p>
        <p>Companies saying they would beat earnings' estimates were amply rewarded by investors. Corning was the best example.</p>
        <p>The company, the biggest maker of glass used in fiber optic networks, said earnings would be well above estimates, citing strong demand for optical fibers, cables and components. The stock rose 18 1/2, to 230 1/2.</p>
        <p>Corning's announcement bolstered other fiber optic makers, including SDL, which gained 11 63/64 , to 261 63/64 , and JDS Uniphase, which closed at 115 9/16 , up 5.</p>
        <p>Rising prices for crude oil lifted that sector. Exxon Mobil, a Dow component, gained 19/16 , to 80 3/4; Royal Dutch Petroleum rose 1 1/2, to 64; and BP Amoco gained 1 1/2, to 57 3/8.</p>
        <p>Financial stocks recouped some of the losses they sustained last week.</p>
        <p>American International Group rose 2, to 119 9/16 ; J. P. Morgan gained 11/16 , to 129 5/8; and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter added 19/16 , to 80 13/16 .</p>
        <p>William Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, said the slowing economy should help stocks through the summer.</p>
        <p>''There is a reasonably good chance we could see the S.&amp; P. 500 index reach new highs this summer,'' he said. ''But I don't think that is going to happen with the Nasdaq. Valuations earlier this year in that index just got too extreme.''</p>
