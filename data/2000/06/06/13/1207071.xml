        <p>The Justice Department has agreed to pay $18 million to the estate of former President Richard M. Nixon in compensation for presidential papers, photographs and tape recordings that were seized after Mr. Nixon's resignation in 1974.</p>
        <p>The settlement ends a 20-year legal battle that was begun by the disgraced former president to obtain payment for a collection of 44 million documents, 3,700 hours of secretly recorded tapes and thousands of photographs that are held in the National Archives.</p>
        <p>Representatives of Mr. Nixon's estate voiced elation at the agreement. They estimated that the estate lawyers would receive the largest share of the amount, $7.4 million, while the Nixon Foundation, which finances a presidential library in Yorba Linda, Calif., and a research center in Washington would receive a total of about $6 million.</p>
        <p>Subtracting about $3.75 million for taxes, the representatives said, Mr. Nixon's two daughters, Julie Nixon Eisenhower and Tricia Nixon Cox, would together receive less than one-half of 1 percent of the settlement amount, or less than $90,000.</p>
        <p>''We are extremely satisfied that President Nixon's two-decades-old resolution to make sure his privately funded library would have the wherewithal to do the kind of pursuits he wanted to do has been fulfilled,'' said John H. Taylor, the director of the Richard Nixon Library and a co-executor of the estate.</p>
        <p>Critics voiced dismay at the deal, which they said amounted to a fleecing of American taxpayers over material that incriminated Mr. Nixon in obstruction of justice and a variety of other crimes.</p>
        <p>''It is unfortunate that taxpayers have to pay for what is already rightfully theirs,'' said Peter Kornbluh, senior analyst at the National Security Archive, a nonprofit research organization that collects historical documents.</p>
        <p>Unlike the taxpayer-maintained libraries of all other former presidents, who donated their presidential papers, Mr. Nixon's library, with an annual budget of $4.6 million, depends on private donations and its $13 million endowment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nixon's drive for compensation stemmed largely from his desire to keep the library and research center going in the belief that Americans would wait a long time before deciding to pay for them with tax dollars, said Mr. Taylor, the library director.</p>
        <p>''I think he knew the passions of the Vietnam era would die hard,'' Mr. Taylor said. ''History has proved him right in that regard.''</p>
        <p>The research center based in Washington, called the Nixon Center, is nonpartisan and focuses on foreign affairs.</p>
        <p>Shortly after Mr. Nixon resigned to avoid impeachment arising from the Watergate scandal, Congress passed a law confiscating the materials he had left behind. In 1978, lawmakers approved the Presidential Records Act, which ensured that the papers of all subsequent presidents would be the property of the American public.</p>
        <p>''It's our belief that presidential papers belong to all the American people,'' said David W. Ogden, acting assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's civil division. ''This settlement brings to a close 20 years of litigation surrounding President Nixon's papers.''</p>
        <p>A federal court of appeals in 1992 ruled that the materials seized belonged to Mr. Nixon and that he was entitled to compensation.</p>
        <p>''Given the court of appeals decision,'' Mr. Ogden said, ''this is a fair resolution for the taxpayer.''</p>
        <p>The appeals court ruling opened the way for prolonged legal wranglings over the value of the presidential materials. Mr. Nixon's estate sought about $200 million for the various papers, tapes and photographs. An appraiser for the estate argued that several drafts edited by hand of a 1972 Nixon speech announcing plans for increased bombing in the Vietnam War were together worth about $19,000.</p>
        <p>Stephen E. Ambrose, the historian who wrote a multivolume Nixon biography, said the documents were of incalculable value to researchers. Mr. Nixon's insistence that they were his personal property, Mr. Ambrose said, has a precedent reaching back to George Washington.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Ambrose said the documents generated by a president should never have been considered private property.</p>
        <p>''He was being paid by us, the taxpayers, to do his job,'' Mr. Ambrose said. ''Those papers belong to us.''</p>
