        <p>If there is one issue Representative Rick A. Lazio finds solidly his, one area in which he comfortably pronounces himself an expert, it is housing.</p>
        <p>It is not an area many people identify with Republicans, perhaps because the 2.7 million families living in public or subsidized housing nationwide tend to be concentrated in or near urban areas more closely aligned with Democrats. And Mr. Lazio's claims may irritate Democrats, who believe he takes more credit than he deserves.</p>
        <p>But on this issue, Mr. Lazio, the Republican nominee for the United States Senate, totes some credentials. As chairman of the House subcommittee on housing, he supported legislation in 1998 that encouraged a greater presence of moderate-income people in public housing for low-income tenants.</p>
        <p>Today he attended a meeting of housing experts to announce a program intended to foster home ownership. His frequent references to housing on the campaign trail provide a way to appeal to voters uncomfortable with Hillary Rodham Clinton by demonstrating he is not a narrowly focused suburban lawmaker.</p>
        <p>This strategy also serves another purpose. It has allowed Mr. Lazio to criticize Mrs. Clinton indirectly, through a war of words with Andrew M. Cuomo, the secretary of housing and urban development and a major supporter of Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio refrained from overt attacks today, since he came to the Huntington Hilton here in Suffolk County, his home base, to briefly praise a program sponsored by HUD, the Community Development Corporation of Long Island and Fannie Mae, the federal home financing agency. An outgrowth of the 1998 legislation, it is one of eight pilot programs nationwide that will test the concept of allowing low-income tenants to use federal rent subsidies to help pay mortgages.</p>
        <p>''Think about what a home means,'' Mr. Lazio said before flying to Albany. ''It's where you do homework with your children or watch them play in the backyard.''</p>
        <p>Representatives from HUD were on hand, and although everybody acted cordially, HUD officials wanted to make clear that many of the ideas Mr. Lazio praises, like the home ownership initiatives, originated with Mr. Cuomo's staff and housing advocates.</p>
        <p>''I think it was a combination of a lot of different people, a lot of housing activists,'' said Charlie King, Mr. Cuomo's representative for New York and New Jersey, who attended the news conference. ''Certainly the president had a role in this. Congressman Lazio had some role in this. There are a lot of different people who came together to make this a reality.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, who often speaks of his visits to housing projects across the country, has noted the bipartisan support on housing but has also not shied from taking a lot of credit for himself and Republicans.</p>
        <p>Last week he angered Mr. Cuomo, first during a trip upstate for a conference of mayors and again a day later in Washington, after he said that Republicans had taken the lead on new housing initiatives in recent years.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to say anything much disparaging about Andrew Cuomo,'' Mr. Lazio told reporters after his speech last Tuesday at the mayors' conference in Saratoga Springs. ''Suffice it to say that I think all the leadership on housing issues has come from the Republican side, in particular from the House of Representatives.''</p>
        <p>The next day, Mr. Lazio put out a statement backing Congressional Republicans who had accused HUD of fraud and waste. ''We are simply raising questions with an agency that consistently fails to manage itself in a manner that taxpayers deserve,'' Mr. Lazio said.</p>
        <p>David Egner, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, countered that Congressional Republicans, including Mr. Lazio, could not describe themselves as allies of public housing when they had constantly sought substantial cuts to HUD's budget.</p>
        <p>Either way, it is not often that Republicans take up public housing as a selling point.</p>
        <p>Kieran Mahoney, a Republican political consultant not working for Mr. Lazio, said that an emphasis on housing helps Mr. Lazio for a number of reasons.</p>
        <p>''I think his work on public housing has benefits,'' Mr. Mahoney said. ''First of all, it is an indication he has a record of legislative accomplishment to run on. It suggests given the situation he would acquit himself well. Secondly, the fact he acquitted himself well on an issue that normally is the province of Democrats as opposed to Republicans is indicative he has an open mind. It's symbolically important in terms of saying here is a guy who gets stuff done and his concerns are not narrowly focused on the concerns of his district.''</p>
        <p>Later today in Albany, Mr. Lazio greeted visitors to the Capitol and met privately with Senate Republicans. He also took up other policy questions, declaring his support for the hate crimes bill that the State Senate passed last week. It imposes stiffer penalties for crimes motivated by hatred of any of several particular groups, including gays. For years, senators had balked at protecting gays.</p>
        <p>''I believe that people ought not to be subject to violence because of their background, that that's a particularly corrosive impact on society, and that we ought to take a strong stand,'' Mr. Lazio said, standing by the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno. ''I want to stand with Senator Bruno and the Senate majority on the bill.''</p>
