        <p>In a city of towering architecture and high art, it is nothing less than the official arbiter of public taste. Who else, besides the 102-year-old Art Commission, would seriously deliberate the curlicues on lampposts, the color scheme of playgrounds or the arrangement of those dour-looking statues of all-but-forgotten military figures?</p>
        <p>But despite its stature as artistic watchdog, the Art Commission has become something of a crumbling fortress. What started last year as a  spat over the design of flagpoles has flared into combat at City Hall, where Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has apparently joined a coalition at  the City Council trying to have the commission broken up.</p>
        <p>''It really is a kind of creaky, old-fashioned institution,'' said John S. Dyson, a close friend of the mayor and an adviser on questions of culture. ''The question is, 'What role should the city play in reviewing art?' and the mayor thinks it is worthy of discussion.''</p>
        <p>Last month, more than a dozen  Council members turned up the conversation's volume by introducing a resolution to have the Art Commission put out of business.</p>
        <p>These blows from the two principal chambers of City Hall have clearly come as a shock to the Art Commission, a volunteer group, most of whom are mayoral appointees, that sits in judgment over an array of statuary, lights, architectural ornaments and other fixtures in parks and on city-owned property. The members have spanned the upper ranks of New York's social and artistic pantheon. Few civic groups  could lay claim to its longevity or past celebrity. A list of alumni includes J. Pierpont Morgan (a member from 1904 to 1907), the architect Hugh Ferriss (1947-1949) and the painter Adolph Gottlieb (1967-1969).</p>
        <p>The battle began last year when Henry J. Stern, the commissioner of  parks and recreation, had more than 700 flagpoles with nautical yardarms erected on Parks Department property without authorization from the Art Commission. This led to a legal dispute in which the  commission president's predecessor sued Mr. Stern and then resigned in protest. It evolved into bitter negotiations, and now 24 of the yardarms remain under commission review and potential veto.</p>
        <p>''We surely have bigger things to deal with than flagpoles,'' said Jean Parker Phifer, a Manhattan architect and the commission's current president. ''What is important is to have independent design review.''</p>
        <p>''They're all wrong,'' Bud Konheim, a commission member, said of the nautical flagpoles. ''They belong in no place in the city.''</p>
        <p>The dispute underscores a balancing act the commission has always had to maintain, since its mandate in the City Charter makes it a clearinghouse for details of art and architecture that might otherwise go unnoticed, like flagpoles.</p>
        <p>Under city rules, the commission's 11-member board is required to include a painter, a sculptor, an architect, a landscape architect and representatives from the New York Public Library, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Brooklyn Museum of Art. With three paid staff members, its annual budget of less than $200,000 ranks among the smallest in city government.</p>
        <p>''Agencies could review things themselves, but they don't have the perspective or the impartiality, because it is their own projects,'' Ms. Phifer said. ''They have budget constraints, time constraints, and department heads who want it done yesterday. So we represent the city.''</p>
        <p>Since the broad-based challenge to the Art Commission began to unfold before the Council on May 23, the commission's board has garnered passionate support from some of the city's most powerful art groups, including the Municipal Art Society, and from some on the Council itself.</p>
        <p>Its most powerful defender at City Hall is Peter F. Vallone, speaker of the Council, who said he opposed breaking up the Art Commission even though he had fought his own battles with the group. These included, in the mid-1990's, a protracted six-month review of statues that had been donated by people in Greece to Athens Square Park in Astoria, a part of Mr. Vallone's district.</p>
        <p>For now, the commission's fate is locked in a political standoff.</p>
        <p>''I would be very distressed if the Council was able to abolish them,'' said former Mayor Edward I. Koch, who worked closely with the Art Commission during his City Hall tenure. ''This is a matter of principle,'' he said. ''You don't support the Art Commission and then walk off the train when they decide against something you like.''</p>
        <p>Lined up squarely in opposition is Mr. Stern, who has battled the Art Commission tenaciously during most of his tenure, seven years under Mayor Koch and now six years under Mayor Giuliani, as the custodian of the city's parks and war memorials.</p>
        <p>''We are dealing with a combination of arrogance, elitism and a patronizing attitude,'' Mr. Stern said.</p>
        <p>''When you are under orders from the mayor to build $2 million or $3 million in projects on schedule, and you can't build because they have veto power, there is a serious problem.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Stern's charge of elitism, echoed by some on the Council, may be buttressed both by the makeup of its board and the unlikely corner it occupies in City Hall. Its offices fill an airy, art-filled, atticlike space directly under the building's rooftop clock tower, giving the impression of a  well-appointed garret. Some critics prefer to call it an ivory tower.</p>
        <p>When it holds public meetings, the commission often commands City Hall's Public Hearing Chambers, a large ceremonial room usually reserved for the mayor's budget address and other events that draw more than 100 spectators. Yet the commission's meetings routinely attract fewer than 10 members of the public, plus the agency officials who come to defend their projects. ''We would certainly welcome more public participation,'' Ms. Phifer said.</p>
        <p>The commission's current board, like its predecessors over the century, is drawn from a mix of art and affluence. The charter requires that the mayor select artists on the board from a list submitted by the Fine Arts Federation of New York, and his appointees include the sculptor John W. Rhoden, whose work has been exhibited at major American and European museums, and Jean Rather, a painter married to the CBS News anchor Dan Rather. Other members, drawn from business and academia, include Bud Konheim, president of the Nicole Miller fashion company; Michelle H. Bogart, the director of graduate art studies at the State University at Stony Brook; and Abby S. Milstein, a lawyer and a trustee of the New York Public Library who is a member of the Milstein family of developers.</p>
        <p>Ms. Phifer said the commission may suffer from a perception that it is too closely associated with the upper crust, but pointed out that the composition of its board is dictated by century-old provisions of the charter. If the rules were changed, she said, she would favor broader participation by arts professionals, and might agree to a requirement that seats be reserved for representatives of each of the five boroughs.</p>
        <p>But if the Art Commission's board has provoked charges of aloofness, some defenders respond, ''So what?''</p>
        <p>''There may be a tendency to consider them haughty, but I'll put myself down as a fierce supporter of the Art Commission,'' said Brendan J.  Sexton, the president of the Times Square Business Improvement District, who had extensive dealings with the commission in his former posts as the president of the Municipal Art Society and head of the city's Department of Sanitation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sexton said one encounter with the Art Commission came in the late 1980's, when the Department of Sanitation was struggling to come up with a design for street trash canisters that could be affixed so they would not be stolen. ''It was frustrating at the time,'' he said of the negotiations, in which the commission rejected several proposals and delayed installation of the canisters for months. ''But now I'm grateful,'' he said. ''We consider ourselves the cultural capital of America, and no other body insists that we look like a cultural capital.''</p>
        <p>In an interview, Mr. Dyson said Mayor Giuliani was unlikely to favor eliminating the Art Commission, but might instead call for a change in the  charter that would give him a freer hand in choosing members of its board, probably without nominations from an outside arts group. ''The commission has become something of an obscure group,'' he said, adding that ''it is not always easy to get people to participate as a member.''</p>
        <p>But some of the Council critics seem more militant. The sponsors of the bill to eliminate the Art Commission attracted support from across an ideological spectrum, from conservative Republicans to liberal Democrats, all of whom said they were exasperated by the commission's slow response and arbitrary objections to projects.</p>
        <p>Councilman James S. Oddo, a Staten Island Republican and an ally of the mayor, said his constituents were angry over the commission's threat to remove one of the the Parks Department's flagpoles from Frederick Staats Circle. He introduced the bill to do away with the commission.</p>
        <p>''Why would this to go from a silly yardarm to to a confrontation like the we have now?'' Mr. Oddo asked. ''I'll tell you why. It was their response. As an elected official I expect there to be some tension, some give and take, but I also expect not be treated with arrogance by people who act like they don't know who you are.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Oddo declined to predict whether he could muster enough support to dissolve the Art Commission. ''But even if I don't,'' he said, ''I think it will be productive to bring them in, let them know where we stand and air this thing out.''</p>
