        <p>Standing on the stage at Madison Square Garden momentarily shrouded in darkness, Bruce Springsteen  sang the words ''41 shots'' nine times last night. The words begin his new song deploring the killing of Amadou Diallo by four police officers.</p>
        <p>The crowd grew silent, then rose in applause, as Mr. Springsteen began to sing. Scattered boos were quickly enveloped in the cries of ''Bruce!''</p>
        <p>The song, ''American Skin,'' has been criticized by Police Commissioner Howard Safir and Patrick J. Lynch, the president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, who has urged New York City officers to boycott Mr. Springsteen's concerts.</p>
        <p>But that boycott was not strictly observed yesterday. ''It's not a big deal. People blow things up,'' said Natalie Carbone, 25, a New Jersey native, lifelong Springsteen fan and New York City police officer. ''I don't think this will affect what police officers think about Bruce Springsteen. It's just a song.''</p>
        <p>But other fans said they were disappointed that Mr. Springsteen had chosen to perform the song in New York City. ''He shouldn't use his power to make a statement like that,'' said Heather Milyo of Staten Island, whose fiance is a police officer. ''I think you have to be in a cop's shoes to understand what happened.''</p>
        <p>The ''41 shots'' Mr. Springsteen sings about refer to the number of bullets fired at Mr. Diallo as he stood in front of his apartment in the Bronx last year, and it includes the lyric, ''You can get killed just for living in your American skin.''</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Springsteen has not released a recording of the song, controversy has built around it since he first performed it on June 4 in Atlanta. Mr. Diallo's mother, Kadiatou Diallo, has said she took the song as a sign that people cared about her son. But police officers, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Mr. Safir have frowned on it, suggesting that it is wrong to condemn the officers who were acquitted of murder and other charges in February.</p>
        <p>Representatives of Mr. Springsteen yesterday declined to comment on the criticism of the song.</p>
        <p>Mr. Diallo, a black street vendor from Guinea, was shot by the four white officers on Feb. 4, 1999. The officers testified that they had thought he was reaching for a gun. Mr. Diallo was unarmed and was apparently reaching for his wallet, a fact Mr. Springsteen focuses on in the song.</p>
        <p>Mr. Springsteen sang: ''Is it a gun? Is it a knife? Is it a wallet? This is your life.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani said yesterday that he understood why the officers were angry about the song. ''There are still people trying to create the impression that the police officers are guilty, and they are going to feel strongly about that,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Safir said that police officers had a right not to like Mr. Springsteen's music. ''I personally don't particularly care for Bruce Springsteen's music or his songs,'' he said.</p>
