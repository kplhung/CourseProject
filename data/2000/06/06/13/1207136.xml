        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The chief effect of the abolition of the inheritance tax on the 2 percent of estates that pay them (front page, June 10) would be the further pileup of wealth at the top of our society, turning us into an all-devouring plutocracy. Sponsors of the bill just passed in the House say the legislation is meant to benefit families who inherit small farms or businesses who are forced to sell them to pay estate taxes. If so, why was the bill not tailored to save them, and them alone, from the interruption of family enterprises?</p>

        <p>What will the result be if this  bill stands? Generation after generation of the rich will become richer, until their stagnant weight smothers the opportunities of the other 98 percent of Americans.</p>
