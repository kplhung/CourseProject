        <p>The fires were set in the most diabolic of locations, cutting off escape routes and filling stairwells and hallways with flames and blinding black smoke.</p>
        <p>Worse yet, they were set in rapid succession -- four within just three hours early yesterday morning -- and that forced nearly 160 Brooklyn firefighters into a desperate scramble. With each panicked call to 911, fire companies raced from block to block in Bushwick, rescuing dozens of families from burning tenements.</p>
        <p>It was a miracle, fire officials said, that no one was killed in the suspected arson attacks, the latest in a baffling rash of suspicious fires that have plagued one of the poorest sections of Brooklyn this year. One of the earlier fires -- there were 15 in January and February -- killed a 6-year-old boy, Axel Oyola.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's fires injured 15 firefighters and five residents. Most of the injuries were minor, but four of the firefighters suffered second-degree burns and were admitted to the burn unit at the New York Weill Cornell Center in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Last night, a 26-year-old man with a history of mental illness was arrested and charged with setting the first fire yesterday, at 154 Bleecker Street, an investigator said.</p>
        <p>The suspect, Ramon Sanchez, of Central Avenue in Brooklyn, was also spotted at the scene of the other three fires but had not been charged in connection with them as of 10 p.m., the investigator said.</p>
        <p>The investigator declined to comment on whether Mr. Sanchez was also a suspect in any of the earlier fires.</p>
        <p>But investigators had said earlier in the day that, given the circumstances and locations of the most recent fires, they were aggressively pursuing the possibility that all were the work of the same arsonist or arsonists.</p>
        <p>Although firefighters managed to save two of the apartments from serious damage, two others were gutted by flames and at least a dozen families, many of them Hispanic immigrants, were left homeless. Most of the families lost everything but the clothing they were wearing when they escaped.</p>
        <p>Last night, 28 people, 7 of them children, were staying in housing provided by the American Red Cross, said Jamie Drogin, a spokeswoman for the organization.</p>
        <p>The fire at 154 Bleecker Street, a three-story apartment building near Wilson Avenue, was reported at 2:49 a.m. Several piles of debris were set on fire in the basement, sending clouds of smoke billowing up into six apartments.</p>
        <p>Firefighters had the fire under control before it did much serious damage, but then a second fire was reported at 2:59 a.m. only a block away at 1287 Greene Avenue, another three-story apartment building.</p>
        <p>This fire began on a second-floor landing, just outside the door of Gladys Resto and her three children.</p>
        <p>Ms. Resto, awakened by an explosion, looked through her peep hole to see the hall filled with fire. She roused her children, and the family  managed to escape through the kitchen door. They lost everything, but, she said, ''My kids, I got them out.''</p>
        <p>On the floor above, Pedro Lugo, a 53-year-old school bus driver, found himself trapped in his third-floor apartment. He went to his bedroom window, considered a desperate leap to the ground, then pondered the possibility of lunging for a neighbor's window a good five feet away.</p>
        <p>''I opened the window,'' he said. ''I get out the window. I jump to the other side. I don't know how I make it.''</p>
        <p>Firefighters were still at work at 1287 Greene Avenue when a third fire was reported at 4:59 a.m. at 72 Bleecker Street. This one was started on the front stairs leading to the second floor, cutting off the main escape route. As fire quickly spread throughout the three-story building, tenants headed toward a rear fire escape.</p>
        <p>Anthony Scolavino, a supervising fire marshal, found a woman on the second-floor fire escape, frozen by fear. When he climbed up to rescue her, she told him to look inside instead. There he found a terrified 6-year-old girl. He pulled the girl to safety, lowered her to the ground, then returned to help others.</p>
        <p>Even as firefighters were responding to 72 Bleecker Street, they realized that a fourth fire was burning two buildings away, at 64 Bleecker Street. Someone had set fire to clothes that had been left to dry on the railing of the third floor stairwell. This fire did not do much damage, but as residents recounted how they escaped, their fear quickly turned to anger.</p>
        <p>What sort of person, they asked again and again, would set fires to buildings filled with sleeping families?</p>
