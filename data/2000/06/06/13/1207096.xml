        <p>Despite a change of opponent from the New York City mayor to a Long Island congressman, a steady diet of television advertising and a vigorous schedule of trips around the state, Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign for Senate appears to be largely stuck in place, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton now finds herself locked in a tight race with Rick A. Lazio, an opponent so unknown that most New Yorkers were unable to offer any opinion of him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's selection to replace Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani as the Republican candidate for Senate has scrambled the dynamics of the contest, the poll found. Mrs. Clinton is swamping Mr. Lazio in New York City as a notable number of Mr. Giuliani's supporters have turned to Mrs. Clinton, reverting to historical party voting habits. Conversely, Mr. Lazio, as a more conventional statewide Republican candidate than the mayor, seems to be blunting what had been Mrs. Clinton's unusually competitive position in upstate New York, which usually favors Republicans by large margins.</p>
        <p>With her new opponent, Mrs. Clinton appears to have gained an advantage on at least one major issue, her call for registration of new guns, which New Yorkers agree with by an overwhelming measure. But Mr. Lazio, a four-term congressman from Suffolk County, is now viewed by New Yorkers as equally able to get along with colleagues in the Senate, suggesting that Mrs. Clinton has lost what her aides had believed was one of her most persuasive arguments against sending the mayor of New York to Washington.</p>
        <p>Still, the overall portrait of this tumultuous race remains essentially unchanged from when Mr. Giuliani was Mrs. Clinton's opponent, notwithstanding the large difference in reputation and name recognition between Mr. Giuliani and the 42-year-old congressman. If the election were held today, Mrs. Clinton, 52, would have the support of 44 percent of likely voters, compared with 39 percent for Mr. Lazio, a difference that is statistically insignificant, according to the poll, which was taken from June 4 through June 10.</p>
        <p>When undecided voters were pushed to state a preference, Mrs. Clinton had 49 percent to Mr. Lazio's 43 percent. In the last Times/CBS poll, in April, Mrs. Clinton led Mr. Giuliani by 8 percentage points, although that was in the midst of the fallout over Mr. Giuliani's handling of the Patrick M. Dorismond shooting by the police.</p>
        <p>The poll suggests some reason for concern for Mrs. Clinton and her advisers. The broad expression of support for Mr. Lazio -- he is doing almost precisely as well as Mr. Giuliani did before he dropped out -- came notwithstanding the fact that more than half of New Yorkers said they did not know enough about him to offer an opinion about the Republican candidate for Senate. As such, it is compelling evidence of the resilience of anti-Clinton attitude in the state.</p>
        <p>''I am going to vote for Lazio because he is not Hillary,'' John Werner, a Republican software engineer from Rochester, declared in a follow-up interview, even though he said he did not have enough information about Mr. Lazio to say whether he liked him. ''I'm going to vote for someone who has been a resident of New York State as opposed to someone who has recently moved into the state.''</p>
        <p>What is more, Mrs. Clinton's position in the polls has remained almost  stagnant after a period in which her campaign has introduced four new television advertisements and orchestrated an elaborate convention in which she was designated to run for office. It also came during a time of turmoil for the Republicans, who watched Mr. Giuliani withdraw from the race to deal with a diagnosis of  cancer and a collapsing marriage.</p>
        <p>That said, there are some hopeful indicators for the first lady. Mr. Lazio remains an unknown quantity to most New Yorkers, giving Mrs. Clinton's campaign a chance to fill in those blanks, which her aides said she was intending to do soon with speeches and television ads intended to portray him as too conservative for New York. There was a slight increase in the number of New Yorkers with a favorable impression of Mrs. Clinton, from 39 percent in April to 45 percent now.</p>
        <p>The reversion of the contest to a more traditional Democratic-Republican model, given Mr. Lazio's more traditional Republican views, shows signs of playing to her advantage, on issues ranging from gun registration to tax cuts. And Mr. Lazio's attempt to attack Mrs. Clinton for running for office in a state where she did not live before January, as well as his argument that he is better qualified to sit in Congress because he has a record of public service, has yet to show signs of taking hold.</p>
        <p>There has been no appreciable increase in the number of voters who expressed distress at Mrs. Clinton's recent move to New York, and roughly the same number of respondents said that Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Lazio had the ''right kind of experience to be a senator from New York State.''</p>
        <p>The Times/CBS News Poll involved 1,384 registered voters across New York. The margin of sampling error for all registered voters is plus or minus 3 percentage points.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's chief strategist, Mike Murphy, called the poll results bad news for Mrs. Clinton. ''The majority in New York is an anti-Clinton majority,'' Mr. Murphy said. ''She cannot, despite her millions and millions of dollars and full-time campaigning and support of the entire establishment -- from the White House to labor unions -- break through 50 percent. They know her and they decided she should not be in the Senate. There's not much she can do about it.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's advisers asserted that the poll findings were, in fact, good for her, noting in particular the upturn in her favorable rating. Mrs. Clinton's pollster, Mark Penn, contended that Mr. Lazio was doing so well so soon against Mrs. Clinton only because voters did not know much about his views and record, something that Mr. Penn promised would not last for long.</p>
        <p>''Right now, he's benefiting from what I call your celebrity status, of new fresh-faced candidates,'' Mr. Penn said. ''And the celebrity status gets replaced with real opinions about their records.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's aides said she would stress his positions on gun registration and tax cuts supported by the Republican majority in Congress, and how Mr. Lazio would vote on Supreme Court nominees. In the case of the court, Mrs. Clinton appears to be at some advantage: 53 percent of respondents said Mrs. Clinton would ''make decisions you agree with about Supreme Court nominees,'' compared with 43 percent who said the same thing about Mr. Lazio.</p>
        <p>Several Democrats noted with concern that Mrs. Clinton has yet to get above 50 percent, a simple majority, in any major statewide poll this year. Given the extent to which she is known, this could be a reason for concern among her supporters. But Mrs. Clinton's advisers said yesterday that they were becoming increasingly convinced that Mrs. Clinton would not need to win more than 50 percent to win, given the existence of third-party candidates in the contest.</p>
        <p>In one sense, Mr. Lazio's strong standing in a poll against a nationally known figure who has been campaigning aggressively for nearly a year is remarkable. But the Times/ CBS poll suggested that to a large extent, Mr. Lazio's standing was not a reflection of who he is and what he stands for, but rather who he is not. Thus, his support might prove to be less reliable than that expressed for Mr. Giuliani, a figure about whom most New Yorkers had set opinions.</p>
        <p>For example, while 26 percent of respondents said they had a favorable impression of Mr. Lazio, compared with 10 percent who had an unfavorable rating, a full 64 percent had no opinion whatsoever. Just 4 in 10 of Mr. Lazio's supporters said they ''strongly favor him,'' and 3 in 10 said they were supporting him because they disliked the other candidates in the race. And 46 percent of Mr. Lazio's supporters said they wished they had another candidate to choose from. By contrast, 30 percent of Mrs. Clinton's supporters said they wished that they had another candidate to choose from.</p>
        <p>How the Poll Was Conducted</p>
        <p>The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll of New York State is based on telephone interviews conducted June 4 through June 10 with 1,845 adults throughout the state. Of those, 1,384 said they were registered to vote. Interviews were conducted in either English or Spanish.</p>
        <p>The telephone exchanges called were selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges across the state. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed from random digits, permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.</p>
        <p>The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence, and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to geographic region, race, Hispanic origin, sex, age and education.</p>
        <p>In addition, the results about voting preferences and other aspects of the 2000 election for United States Senate are based on the responses of 1,187 ''likely voters.'' Likely voters are those who say they are registered, intend to vote in November, and voted in 1998 or 1996. The survey was further weighted so that New York City residents make up 31 percent of the entire state, which is the city's typical share of total ballots cast on Election Day.</p>
        <p>In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the overall results based on such samples will differ by no more than 3 percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all adult in the state. For smaller subgroups the potential sampling error is larger. For likely voters in the suburbs surrounding New York City, for example, the margin of error is plus or minus six points.</p>
        <p>In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Differences in the wording and order of questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat varying results.</p>
