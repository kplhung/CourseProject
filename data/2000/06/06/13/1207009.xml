        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You report that President Clinton told the graduating seniors at Carleton College that their degrees would be ''a better investment than anything Wall Street could offer'' (news article, June 11). ''Over the course of a career,'' you quote the president as saying, ''a person with a bachelor's degree will earn, on average, $600,000 more than a person who has a high school diploma.''</p>

        <p>The average college graduate will also pay taxes on that $600,000 that far exceed the cost of education at a decent college. Wouldn't it therefore also be a good investment for the government to provide free college education for any qualified student who would otherwise be unable to attend?</p>
