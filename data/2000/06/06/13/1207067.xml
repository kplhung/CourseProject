        <p>Criminal charges against the Church of Scientology in the death of a church member who was under the organization's care were dropped yesterday because Florida prosecutors said they could no longer prove the accusations.</p>
        <p>Bernie McCabe, the state attorney for Pasco and Pinellas Counties, said in a document filed in state court in Clearwater that his office was dismissing the charges because the medical examiner had determined earlier this year that the death of the church member, Lisa McPherson, was accidental.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCabe said the state was unable ''to prove critical forensic and causation issues beyond and to the exclusion of a reasonable doubt'' because the medical examiner, Dr. Joan Wood, had amended her autopsy report in February.</p>
        <p>Marty Rathbun, an official with the Church of Scientology, said that the prosecutor's decision amounted to full exoneration and that the charges had been based on a misinterpretation of medical evidence. Mr. Rathbun said medical experts hired by the church proved that there had been no connection between Ms. McPherson's death and the care provided by church personnel.</p>
        <p>Ms. McPherson died on Dec. 5, 1995, after 17 days of treatment at a church-owned hotel in Clearwater. She had been taken there from a  hospital after a traffic accident. She did not appear to have been injured, but doctors at the hospital said she might have had a mental breakdown.</p>
        <p>Dr. Wood initially said she was unable to determine the cause of Ms. McPherson's death. But she also said that Ms. McPherson had not had liquid for 5 to 10 days and that severe dehydration and bed rest might have contributed to the pulmonary embolism, or blood vessel blockage, that killed her.  Church records showed that Ms. McPherson had become incoherent and violent at the hotel, refusing food and threatening caretakers.</p>
        <p>The church's chief operating arm in Clearwater, the Flag Service Organization, was charged in late 1998 with abuse or neglect of a disabled adult and practicing medicine without a license, felony charges that carried the possibility of $5,000 fines and property forfeiture. No individuals were charged.</p>
        <p>Church officials argued that Ms. McPherson was cared for properly and that she stopped eating. The church's lawyers had challenged both the constitutionality of bringing charges against a religious organization and the medical evidence behind the charges.</p>
        <p>Experts hired by the church challenged the medical examiner's determination that Ms. McPherson was dehydrated. Mr. Rathbun said the church's experts also concluded that it was likely that the embolism that killed Ms. McPherson was related to the auto accident.</p>
        <p>Ms. McPherson's death became a rallying point for opponents of the church, who said Ms. McPherson had been a virtual prisoner at the hotel. Church officials countered that critics and the police used the death as an excuse for religious bias against Scientology.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Rathbun said the decision to drop the charges capped two years in which relations between the church and Clearwater had improved.</p>
        <p>The lawyer for Ms. McPherson's estate, Kennan Dandar, said the estate's civil suit against the church was still pending.</p>
