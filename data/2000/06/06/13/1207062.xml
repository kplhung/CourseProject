        <p>The Yankees are scheduled to face Pedro Martinez tonight, only 16 days after they saw him the last time. It gets even better. They can do it yet a third time next week in Boston. What hath the schedule-maker wrought?</p>
        <p>''It's unfortunate we don't play more spread out throughout the season,'' Tino Martinez said of the frequency of meetings between the Yankees and the Red Sox, without regard to Martinez's appearance in the games. ''After we go there, more than half the season is left and we're almost done with them.''</p>
        <p>Baseball officials have been unable to explain why the great Yankees-Red Sox rivalry, 2000 version, is being staged, for the most part, before their division race goes beyond the tepid stage. This season's schedule includes so many seemingly inexplicable facets.</p>
        <p>But from the Yankees' point of view, by early next week, before the month of June is gone, they will have been fodder for the league's best pitcher more often than any other team.</p>
        <p>''He's a special pitcher,'' Mike Stanley, a teammate, said, speaking of Martinez at Yankee Stadium yesterday. ''It's so exciting when he gets on the mound. He incites the crowd no matter where he is. It's usually the biggest crowd the stadium, wherever we are, attracts. He's one of a kind.''</p>
        <p>When Martinez encountered the Yankees the first time this season, he shut them out with a four-hitter. He didn't allow the Cleveland Indians any runs either in his only start since that May 28 game at Yankee Stadium. He has lowered his earned run average to 0.95. The league's next lowest E.R.A., belonging to Gil Heredia of Oakland, is 3.13. The E.R.A. for all of the other pitchers in the league is 4.92.</p>
        <p>And if Martinez's overall E.R.A. isn't frightening enough, how about his E.R.A. in night games: 0.82. And in games on the road: 0.51.</p>
        <p>Opposing batters are hitting .152 against the remarkable right-hander. Next lowest batting average: .221 against Chuck Finley of Cleveland. Leaguewide batting average against all pitchers: .274. Martinez leads the league in strikeouts, too, with 114. Finley is second with 89.</p>
        <p>Absolutely he makes life easier for the defense, Stanley said. ''He strikes out so many people you don't have to worry about those guys. A lot of times we joke when he strikes out the side. We say, 'Great defense, guys.' ''</p>
        <p>Opposing batters have faced Martinez 45 times this season with runners in scoring position. Two have managed to get hits. That computes to a .044 average. That also should make Ben Grieve of Oakland and Greg Vaughn of Tampa Bay candidates for the Hall of Fame.</p>
        <p>''That's what makes him so great,'' Stanley said. ''Some guys are able to turn it up a notch and reach back for something a little bit more when they have runners on base. As tough as it is to get a hit against him, you know it's even tougher when men are on base because he's going to bear down a little bit more. That's the mark of a great pitcher, a guy that gets a runner on third base and less than two out and he gets a strikeout and a weak fly ball to end the inning. It's just remarkable what he's able to do.''</p>
        <p>And the Yankees get to face him three times in just about three weeks. Now there would be a pleasant thought for other teams, the prospect of playing against Martinez once a week. Players would get weekly stomach aches and not be able to play that night.</p>
        <p>''I don't think you can go out there fearing him,'' Derek Jeter, the Yankees' fine hitter, said. ''If you do that, you might as well not even go up there. You're going to have three or four at-bats against him. That's 12 strikes. You have to make the most of it.''</p>
        <p>Opposing hitters are not the only players who suffer when Martinez pitches. Opposing pitchers feel the pressure, too.</p>
        <p>''Those guys know that they cannot make any mistakes, cannot give up any big innings,'' Stanley said. ''Pitchers know who they're facing and the type of offense their team has and whether they're capable of scoring runs.''</p>
        <p>On the other hand the presence of Martinez on the mound sometimes works for the other pitcher. Stanley recalled a game early last month when Steve Trachsel of Tampa Bay shut out the Red Sox, 1-0, in a Martinez start. ''I talked to Fred McGriff at first base and he said he had never seen him more focused than he was that day,'' Stanley said. ''He knew he had to throw his best game.''</p>
        <p>Martinez, however, most often renders his opponent's performance not good enough. Roger Clemens, operating perhaps more on memory than mechanics, summoned his best effort as a member of the Yankees in his start against Martinez May 28 and still fell short, allowing a ninth-inning two-run home run for the only runs of the game.</p>
        <p>On second thought, maybe the schedule-maker did the Yankees a favor. They can get most of their losses to Martinez out of the way now and spend the rest of the season making up for them. They can approach the stretch run in September knowing they can lose to Pedro only once more. And if they have positioned themselves properly, once won't be enough to make a difference in the outcome of their race with the Red Sox.</p>
