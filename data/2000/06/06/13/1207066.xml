        <p>The Devils arrived at the Meadowlands this afternoon for a team picture, looking rested and relaxed for the first time in two grueling months. Before they gathered to flash their Stanley Cup-winning smiles they all wondered: What's with the parade?</p>
        <p>They didn't have to wait long for an answer.</p>
        <p>Lou Lamoriello, the team president and general manager, said it would be Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. in the Continental Arena parking lot.</p>
        <p>''We'll have it here at the Meadowlands because our fans know how to get here,'' John McMullen, the team's chairman said before taking his place in the front row for the picture.</p>
        <p>When the Devils captured their first Stanley Cup in 1995, they paraded around the arena parking lot. This time, the players didn't seem to care where the parade would take place this year after they wrested the cup from the Dallas Stars Saturday night in double overtime.</p>
        <p>Today, there were only smiles, especially from Petr Sykora, who watched the cup presentation from a bed at Baylor Medical Center in Dallas. He was taken to the hospital after being flattened with a crunching check by the Stars' Derian Hatcher in the first period of Game 6.</p>
        <p>Sykora, who was kept overnight for observation, stayed on the ice motionless for several minutes before he was strapped on a stretcher.</p>
        <p>Sykora said today he was emotionally touched when some players and Lamoriello cut the celebration short at Reunion Arena to take the cup to his hospital bed.</p>
        <p>He was also moved when he watched Coach Larry Robinson put on his jersey for the on-ice celebration.</p>
        <p>''I was awake watching the end of the game,'' Sykora said. ''I saw what happened and I thought it was awesome. I thought it was also awesome that they brought the Stanley Cup to the hospital. It was so important for me because it made me feel I'm a big part of this team.''</p>
        <p>Sykora said he wasn't allowed to drink Champagne from the cup. ''I was drinking orange juice,'' he said, admitting that he was feeling fine despite having skipped his medication this morning.</p>
        <p>McMullen, who also missed the cup presentation in Dallas, was at the arena this afternoon.</p>
        <p>He watched the game on a huge television screen at the team's training facility in West Orange, N.J., with family and friends because he could not travel because of a bad back. He arrived at the arena this afternoon with his daughter, Kathy.</p>
        <p>Regarding the changes the franchise will face this summer, Lamoriello said he had not decided what he would do under the team's new ownership, YankeeNets. Robinson said the same. Both men said they didn't even want to think about it. All they wanted to do was savor the moment of winning the cup.</p>
        <p>''We won't know until July 12,'' Robinson said, referring to the time the YankeeNets would take over management of the Devils. ''I don't want to think about it now. I thought about things for two months every day during the playoffs. It was so mentally draining.''</p>
        <p>Robinson, who has a contract for two more years as an assistant coach with the Devils and two more as a consultant, said he was willing to come back.</p>
        <p>''If Lou is back and he wants me as a head coach, it's a possibility,'' Robinson said. But with the prospects of George Steinbrenner running the team, Robinson left things open. ''It's a new regime. You never know.''</p>
        <p>SLAP SHOTS</p>
        <p>LOU LAMORIELLO was busy making deals Monday. He traded KRZYSZTOF OLIWA, the team's biggest fighter, to the expansion Columbus Blue Jackets for a third-round pick in the 2001 entry draft. . . . Lamoriello also acquired forwards STEVE STAIOS of the Atlanta Thrashers and ED WARD of the Anaheim Mighty Ducks. They will be exposed in the expansion draft to protect other key players when the Blue Jackets and Minnesota Wild stock their rosters. . . . The Devils submitted a protected list to the league for next week's expansion draft, which included one goaltender, five defensemen and nine forwards -- goaltender MARTIN BRODEUR, defensemen KEN DANEYKO, SCOTT STEVENS, COLIN WHITE, SCOTT NIEDERMAYER and JOSEF BOUMEDIENNE and forwards JOHN MADDEN, BOBBY HOLIK, RANDY McKAY, SERGEI BRYLIN, ALEXANDER MOGILNY, PETR SYKORA, JASON ARNOTT and PATRIK ELIAS. . . . CLAUDE LEMIEUX, SERGEI NEMCHINOV and VLADIMIR MALAKHOV will be unrestricted free agents.</p>
