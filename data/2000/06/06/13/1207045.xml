        <p>As Syria draped itself in black bunting today for state funeral of President Hafez al-Assad on Tuesday, a shadow fell over the preparations with reports that Mr. Assad's maverick, exiled brother has proclaimed himself the rightful heir to power.</p>
        <p>Until now, the country's ruling elite has uniformly backed the ascension of the former leader's 34-year-old son, Bashar. He was swiftly selected as commander in chief of the armed forces and nominated as the sole candidate to succeed his father as president.</p>
        <p>The elder Mr. Assad died on Saturday, leaving behind not only a political vacuum but also a stagnating nation saddled with heavy military commitments in neighboring Lebanon, frozen peace negotiations with Israel and a limping economy.</p>
        <p>He will be buried in his home village, Qardaha, after services in Damascus and the port city of Latakia, the closest major city to the village.</p>
        <p>But Bashar al-Assad's apparently smooth -- and so far automatic -- rise to power was challenged by his uncle, Rifaat al-Assad, who has been living in exile in Europe since an unsuccessful attempt to unseat his brother in 1983.</p>
        <p>''Rifaat al-Assad represents the true legitimacy and is ready to take up his responsibilities at any moment,'' his spokesman, Hafez Kheir, told the BBC's Arabic service.</p>
        <p>In another interview, with Reuters, Mr. Kheir called Rifaat al-Assad ''a leader of the Syrian people'' and denounced the ceremonial transfer of power to President Assad's son. ''What is happening in Syria is a real farce and an unconstitutional piece of theater that is a real violation of the law and the constitution,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Rifaat al-Assad, who is believed to be about 63, was last in Syria in 1994 for the funeral of President Assad's oldest son, Basil. He returned to Europe immediately after the burial and was then systematically stripped of his remaining positions in the ruling Baath Party and his government post as vice president.</p>
        <p>His final fall from grace paralleled the rise of his nephew, Bashar, as President Assad's clear choice as a successor. In exile, Rifaat Assad has maintained a platform for his activities through a satellite television channel, the Arab News Network, operated by one of his sons.</p>
        <p>The international Arabic newspaper Al Hayat reported that Syrian security forces have been ordered to arrest Rifaat al-Assad if they catch him trying to enter the country.</p>
        <p>The Assad family squabbles may be important if they turn out to represent larger tensions within their Alawite community, the religious sect that has grown from an impoverished Syrian minority to its most favored political class under President Assad. If Bashar al-Assad fails to solidify his authority or becomes a weak titular president, he may not be able to guarantee his fellow Alawites a continuation of the privileges they enjoyed during his father's 30-year reign.</p>
        <p>In that case, some may turn to Rifaat al-Assad as a potential strongman to recoup their political losses.</p>
        <p>In Paris, Eric Rouleau, a former French ambassador to Syria, said the attack from Mr. Assad's brother could encourage other groups to openly criticize the transfer of power from father to son in a country that is supposed to be a constitutional republic. ''Rifaat al-Assad is a multibillionare who lives abroad, who has properties everywhere and who has above all a television station that he uses as a propaganda instrument,'' Mr. Rouleau said. ''He has no chance to take power. The importance of his declaration is that it opens a Pandora's box.''</p>
        <p>Diplomats in the Middle East say that Rifaat Assad, who is widely reported to have enriched himself through cross-border trade and smuggling between Lebanon and Syria, still commands the loyalty of some Syrian Army units.</p>
        <p>When he was in favor, he was widely considered to be the brutal enforcer of his brother's policy of suppressing political dissent. In 1982, Rifaat al-Assad led troops in the assault on the northern city of Hama to crush a revolt by a group of Muslim extremists. The attack leveled much of the city. Unofficial accounts from human rights groups have put the death toll at 10,000 to 20,000 people.</p>
        <p>One year later, as President Assad was in the hospital recovering from a heart attack, tank units loyal to his brother moved into Damascus in what was seen as a coup attempt.</p>
        <p>But for the moment, senior army officers have lined up behind the late president's son. Lt. Gen. Mustafa Tlass, the defense minister, said the military would protect Bashar al-Assad from any threat.</p>
        <p>''Now we have a sole candidate for the presidency,'' the general said in an interview on the Lebanese television station Future, ''and there is popular unanimity, and this is clear from the demonstrations and the people's emotions.''</p>
