        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''As War Wanes, Tourists Return to Turkey's East'' (Kars Journal, June 7): Tourism is indeed a positive sign of a newly stabilized region. But it should not come at the cost of human and civil rights.</p>
        <p>You state that in the 1990's, ''violence was common and tourism all but unthinkable'' and that current conditions ''are more relaxed than they have been in years.'' Your reasoning is this: ''Today the Kurdish rebel leader is in jail. His guerrillas have stopped fighting.'' You ignore the oppression of 20 million Kurds by the Turkish government.</p>

Your reasoning is this: ''Today the Kurdish rebel leader is in jail. His guerrillas have stopped fighting.'' You ignore the oppression of 20 million Kurds by the Turkish government.</p>
        <p>Kurds have been arrested for speaking their own language and practicing the traditions that have been part of their culture for thousands of years. Just this month, two Kurdish mayors were denied the right to travel to the United States to speak about human rights violations.</p>
        <p>The Kurdish struggle is not over.</p>
