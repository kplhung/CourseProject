        <p>Were the Neanderthals skilled hunters who ate almost nothing but meat? Or were they mere scavengers, living on the leftovers of nature's predators and whatever plants they came across?</p>
        <p>These questions of Neanderthal food-gathering behavior have long divided paleontologists. But an international team of scientists reported yesterday that new chemical tests of 28,000-year-old Neanderthal bones may have settled the issue. The tests revealed that these now-extinct members of the genus Homo lived almost exclusively on animal protein and so must have been accomplished hunters.</p>
        <p>''This research puts an end to the argument about whether the Neanderthals were primarily scavengers,'' said Dr. Erik Trinkaus, an anthropologist at Washington University in St. Louis, who was a member of the team that conducted and interpreted the studies of bone chemistry.</p>
        <p>In a report to be published in the June 20 issue of The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the team, led by Dr. Michael P. Richards of Oxford University in England, described the analysis of a jawbone and skull bone from two Neanderthals.</p>
        <p>From tiny bone samples the equivalent of no more than a quarter of an inch of pencil lead, the scientists derived chemical signatures of the foods the Neanderthals ate in their lifetimes.</p>
        <p>The scientists then compared the bone composition with that of European animals from the same time, including wolves, mammoths, arctic fox and cave bear. The Neanderthal diet, which probably included mammoths, appeared to have been similar to that of the most skilled carnivores in the wild.</p>
        <p>''With a diet dominated by animal protein, the Neanderthals must have been effective predators,'' Dr. Trinkaus said. ''This implies a much higher degree of social organization and behavioral complexity than is frequently attributed to the Neanderthals.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, the hunter-scavenger question has been part of the broader debate among paleontologists and archaeologists over the cultural and physical capabilities of Neanderthals compared with modern humans.</p>
        <p>The new findings suggest that there may have been little difference in the diets and organizational skills of Neanderthals and the modern Homo sapiens, who arrived in the European territory occupied by Neanderthals about 40,000 years ago and eventually replaced them, about 28,000 years ago. The cause of the Neanderthal disappearance remains as unclear as the exact evolutionary relationship between them and modern humans.</p>
        <p>Discussing the implications of the bone studies, Dr. Fred H. Smith, a paleoanthropologist at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb, said, ''There's no reason to believe Neanderthals were any less efficient exploiters of the environment than modern humans.''</p>
        <p>Previous studies had failed to produce unequivocal evidence of Neanderthal hunting. Remains of animal bones and stone tools at some Neanderthal sites suggested that these people ate large amounts of meat, but these were not accepted by many scientists as definitive evidence that they were hunters, with more highly developed skills in planning and organizing their food-gathering forays, and not just scavengers.</p>
        <p>''It was impossible, from the archaeological evidence alone, to see the actual proportion of meat in their diets,'' Dr. Smith said.</p>
        <p>The bone samples were taken from two individuals found at the Vindija cave site near the Croatian capital of Zagreb. The research team also included scientists from the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts and the University of Zagreb.</p>
        <p>Their findings generally matched the results of tests made in the early 1990's on Neanderthal fossils in France and Belgium.</p>
        <p>Similar tests are planned to determine if the same heavy meat-eating behavior by Neanderthals extended to temperate climates, like the Middle East.</p>
