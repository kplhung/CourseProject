        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>What saved my mother from the kind of horrendous end described in ''Planning for Death'' was hospice.</p>
        <p>I had the misconception that hospice was a place people went to die, so I made no inquiries about it: I was determined that my mother die in her own home.</p>
        <p>But in the San Francisco area, I learned, hospice works with you to provide care for the terminally ill at home. This enlightened, wonderful team of nurses, social workers, counselors and volunteers enabled my mother to die at home, peacefully.</p>
        <p>But it was only by chance that I heard about these services. The doctors told me nothing. Though hospice may vary from region to region, those in need would do well to check it out.</p>
