        <p>A New York State judge yesterday overturned stricter no-fault auto insurance regulations that the Pataki administration adopted earlier this year, ruling that state insurance officials had failed to consider the impact on people injured in accidents and on the doctors who treat them.</p>
        <p>The rules, which took effect in February, required an injured victim to  notify the insurance company within  30 days of an accident, down from 90. They also gave doctors 45 days, instead of 180, to submit claims for treatment.</p>
        <p>The State Insurance Department, which said the stricter deadlines would protect consumers because the longer limits provided more opportunity for fraudulent schemes that raised premiums for all car owners, said it would appeal the ruling issued yesterday by Justice Phyllis Gangel-Jacob of State Supreme Court in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''We're disappointed in the court decision,'' said a spokeswoman, Terri Marchon.</p>
        <p>The suit challenging the regulations was brought by a coalition representing lawyers, doctors and consumers. They asserted that the new regulations would benefit insurance companies while unjustly penalizing accident victims and the doctors who treated their injuries.</p>
        <p>The plaintiffs said that a person whose injuries were serious enough to prevent notice to the insurance company within 30 days -- for example, a pedestrian who had been unable to learn which company had insured the car -- could be denied all benefits. They said 30 days was one of the shortest such periods under any state's no-fault law.</p>
        <p>The plaintiffs also said that giving doctors only 45 days after treatment to file for compensation was too little time for many medical offices and billing companies.</p>
        <p>The no-fault law is intended to guarantee payments for medical treatment and for lost wages resulting from car accidents in which a victim's injuries are not serious. Only the seriously injured may file a lawsuit.</p>
        <p>David B. Golomb, president of the New York State Trial Lawyers Association, a group that challenged the new regulations, said that Justice Gangel-Jacob's ruling upheld the Legislature's intentions when it enacted no-fault insurance. Others that  challenged the regulations included the New York Public Interest Research Group, a consumer group.</p>
        <p>Justice Gangel-Jacob ruled that the process by which the Insurance Department had adopted the new regulations was ''arbitrary, capricious and an abuse of discretion,'' and said the agency had ''failed to consider the impact of the new regulations'' on accident victims and doctors.</p>
        <p>She also said that the Insurance Department had failed to offer ''studies or proofs'' to show that the new regulations would reduce fraud, and that it had failed to pursue alternatives toward meeting that goal.</p>
