        <p>It appears that the Mets and the Yankees will try something that almost certainly has never happened before in Major League Baseball history: two teams playing two games in two different parks on the same day.</p>
        <p>Baseball officials were in the process of working through details to schedule a day-night doubleheader on July 8, a Saturday, with the first game at Shea Stadium in the afternoon and the second game at Yankee Stadium at night.</p>
        <p>''Both clubs are working to get all the approvals we need,'' said Lonn Trost, the Yankees' chief operating officer. ''Nothing is official.''</p>
        <p>The Elias Sports Bureau said yesterday that it did not know of any such two-stadium doubleheaders but that it would look for past instances if the Bronx-Flushing doubleheader became official.</p>
        <p>The day-night doubleheader would be born out of necessity: Sunday night's game between the Yankees and the Mets was postponed because of rain, and because the American and National League schedules rarely call for the two teams to be in town on the same day, there are only a few possible dates on which to play the makeup game. The Yankees and the Mets both have a day off on Aug. 31, but playing that Thursday night would be problematic; the Yankees are scheduled to play a night game in Seattle on Aug. 30, and if they play Aug. 31, it would create a string of 41 consecutive days in which the Yankees have games -- contrary to rules established in the Basic Agreement between the players and the owners.</p>
        <p>The game could be pushed back until the day after the regular season ends, with the caveat that it would be played only if it had some bearing on a playoff race. But playing a day-night doubleheader when the Yankees and the Mets meet again next month would ensure that both teams would receive revenue from the sellout crowd.</p>
        <p>And there is something intriguing about having the Yankees and the Mets play host to home games against the other on the same day. ''You would really have a true subway series,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Some issues must be settled. According to rule, makeup games for a day-night doubleheader must be rescheduled on the first available day, and in the case of the Mets and the Yankees, that would be July 7, a Friday. But baseball officials are leery of such a schedule, realizing that releasing tens of thousands of fans into late Friday afternoon traffic -- and expecting many of them to travel to Shea Stadium -- could create a terrible logjam.</p>
        <p>There would be fewer traffic complications on July 8. The most significant question about a doubleheader that day would be what time the second game would start. Fox is broadcasting the afternoon game at Shea, with the game set to begin at about 1:20 p.m.; if it required about three and a half hours to play, then players from both teams could conceivably depart by 5:30 p.m. and navigate through traffic with a police escort to reach Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>Trost said the proposed time of the night game at Yankee Stadium is 8 p.m. ''What we're really trying to do is make it work for everybody,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''It would be kind of cool,'' Tino Martinez, the Yankees' first baseman, said. ''It would be fun.''</p>
        <p>Manager Joe Torre of the Yankees mentioned that the teams would need a police escort to travel from one park to the other, and joked, ''If we can wait for all of the fans to get in their cars, we can all come over together.''</p>
        <p>Talking About Sosa</p>
        <p>The Yankees and the Mets have spoken with the Chicago Cubs about their interest in the slugger Sammy Sosa, if he becomes available. But baseball officials yesterday outlined the many, many obstacles to making such a deal.</p>
        <p>Scouts from the Yankees were in Detroit last night to watch the slugger Juan Gonzalez, who is among the many hitters the Yankees might have interest in acquiring before the July 31 trade deadline.</p>
        <p>*The Cubs would have to decide once and for all that they wanted to rebuild, and then determine they were willing to swap a player who has been the city's most popular athlete since Michael Jordan retired.</p>
        <p>*The Cubs would then present the Yankees with a list of players they wanted in return for Sosa -- presumably, a list stocked with the Yankees' best prospects and perhaps a couple of major league players, as well. Because of Sosa's stature, the Cubs would have to get top value for him, blue-chip players who justify the trade. In other words, the Yankees would have to overpay to get Sosa, and the Cubs would raid the Yankees' minor league system for players like Alfonso Soriano, Drew Henson and Jackson Melian.</p>
        <p>*Sosa can veto any trade proposal because he has been in the majors at least 10 years, at least five of them with the same team. His agent, Adam Katz, is experienced and talented and would not allow this chance for leverage to pass. He is seeking a huge contract extension, and presumably, he would not agree to a deal unless he got the deal he wanted: possibly from $15 million to $20 million a season.</p>
        <p>*Before agreeing to pay Sosa, the Yankees would have to take stock of their outstanding obligations. Bernie Williams, their center fielder, has five and a half years remaining on a deal that pays him $12.5 million a season. Shortstop Derek Jeter is making $10 million now and eventually will get a long-term deal that will pay him between $17 million and $20 million. The reliever Mariano Rivera is making $7.2 million and is in line for a long-term deal. There are understandings on extensions with pitcher Roger Clemens (somewhere in the range of two years for $28 million to $30 million) and second baseman Chuck Knoblauch (two years, $18 million, for the 2002 and 2003 seasons).</p>
        <p>It is a long shot. The Yankees are not close to a deal for Sosa, just as they were not close to trading Williams, and did not trade for Jim Edmonds or Jose Canseco. Sosa's ''name just replaces somebody else's name that was popping up about six weeks ago,'' Torre said.</p>
        <p>Rain, Rain Go Away</p>
        <p>After a wait of more than two and a half hours, the Yankee-Red Sox game was rained out last night at the Stadium, and will be made up on Sept. 11 at 6:05 p.m. Brian Rose, who was scheduled to pitch last night, will pitch tonight's game for the Red Sox against Orlando Hernandez. Pedro Martinez is expected to pitch tomorrow. The Yankees are undecided whether to start Roger Clemens or Ramiro Mendoza.</p>
