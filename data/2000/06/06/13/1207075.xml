        <p>Investigators yesterday identified a former prison librarian as one of five women whose bodies were found last week in barrels on property owned or rented by John Edward Robinson, an ex-convict from Olathe, Kan.</p>
        <p>Chris Koster, prosecuting attorney of Cass County, Mo., said the body of the woman, Beverly J. Bonner, was one of the three found on June 5 in a storage unit. Ms. Bonner, 49, had disappeared in spring 1994.</p>
        <p>Only one other victim, Suzette Marie Trouten, 28, of Monroe County, Mich., has been identified. Her body was one of two found on June 3 in 55-gallon drums on a 16-acre farm Mr. Robinson owns near La Cygne, Kan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Koster said today that he expected more criminal charges to be filed soon against Mr. Robinson, 56, who is being held in lieu of $5 million bail in Olathe on charges of sexually assaulting two women the authorities say he met on the Internet.</p>
        <p>Ms. Trouten was lured to her death last year through an Internet chat room, her former employer said, by a man who offered her a $62,000-a-year job in Kansas as a nurse and companion for his elderly father. Ms. Trouten's mother reported her disappearance on March 1.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bonner and Mr. Robinson might have met at the Western Missouri Corrections Center in Cameron, Mo. in 1991 or 1992. He was serving a sentence related to a a conviction for theft. She was a prison librarian. She was a college graduate, with children from an earlier marriage. Her second husband, Dr. William Bonner, of Stockton, Mo., was a prison doctor.</p>
        <p>Officials with the Missouri Department of Corrections said Ms. Bonner resigned in May 1992. Mr. Robinson was released in April 1993. After a divorce in 1994, Ms. Bonner agreed to work for a man her family now believes was Mr. Robinson.</p>
        <p>According to her brother, Lowell Heath, who lives in Mississippi, Ms. Bonner said she was going abroad to work for an American company that made perfume and other products.</p>
        <p>Mr. Heath said Ms. Bonner's family received typed letters over the years, signed ''Love, Bev,'' from such places as Moscow and Amsterdam. To reply, Mr. Heath said, family members sent their letters to a mail drop in Olathe for forwarding.</p>
        <p>The last letter, dated Dec. 5, 1996, arrived in January 1997. In it, Ms. Bonner said she was leaving Russia and going on assignment to China.  The letter ended: ''Remember that I love you, and I'll be in touch.'' Although the family made repeated efforts to find her, they heard nothing more.</p>
        <p>''They were all fakes,'' Mr. Heath said of the letters today, adding that investigators hoped to analyze the DNA on the postage stamps.</p>
        <p>Police have named other women who disappeared after having some connection with Mr. Robinson.</p>
        <p>They include Catherine Clampitt, 27, who came to Kansas City to live with her brother and get a fresh start in life, according to the Kansas City Star, and vanished in 1987; Lisa Stasi, 19, who disappeared with her 5-month-old, Tiffany, on Jan. 11, 1985; Paula Godfrey, 19, reported missing on Sept. 1, 1984; and Izabela K. Lewicka, 22, of Overland Park, Kan.  She has been missing since last fall.</p>
