        <p>Seven police officers were killed today in an ambush on a rural road in the troubled state of Chiapas, a state official said.</p>
        <p>State Attorney Eduardo Montoya Liebano said one police officer and one civilian had been hurt in El Bosque, the site of longstanding tensions between clashing factions, including supporters of the Zapatista guerrillas. Mr. Montoya said it was not clear what role, if any, the Zapatistas had in the attack.</p>
        <p>The ambush was one of the worst incidents of killings of security forces in the southern state of Chiapas since the Zapatistas lead a brief armed uprising in January 1994, demanding greater democracy and Indian rights.</p>
        <p>A partial accord was signed in 1996, but peace talks broke down.</p>
        <p>The police were on patrol for gangs of armed robbers in the rain-forest region when the gunmen struck, officials said. The dead included two police commanders.</p>
        <p>Army troops were dispatched to the area ''in spite of the risk that implies,'' Mr. Montoya said.</p>
        <p>Bitter differences have divided pro-government and pro-Zapatista factions in El Bosque, an Indian township, since the government sent 1,000 troops in 1998 to oust the Zapatistas from a village that they controlled there and dismantle an independent town government that the rebels had tried to establish. At least 10 people, including police officers and rebels, died in that confrontation.</p>
        <p>In recent months, with the approach of presidential elections on July 2, violent episodes in Chiapas have increased, and more than 12 people have been slain.</p>
        <p>On May 7, three Indians were killed and a 3-year-old suffered a bullet wound in violence that the authorities attributed to a land dispute but that Zapatista sympathizers attributed to armed government supporters.</p>
        <p>The Zapatistas have complained about increasing army and police patrols in their villages. But a number of violent episodes also seemed to indicate an increase in crime not related to politics.</p>
        <p>Gov. Roberto Albores Guillen of Chiapas is one of the most aggressive supporters of the presidential candidate of the governing party, Francisco Labastida Ochoa.</p>
        <p>Opposition leaders in Chiapas have complained that Mr. Albores is worsening the tension in the state with his strongly partisan performance during the campaign.</p>
