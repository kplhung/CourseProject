        <p>This week's meetings between South Korea's president, Kim Dae Jung, and North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, mark an encouraging change in the relationship between the two Koreas. In the 55 years since the Korean Peninsula was divided after World War II, the North has directed invasion, infiltration and terrorism against the South and both sides have employed vitriolic propaganda against each other. Now, for the first time, the top leaders on each side are getting together to discuss mutual concerns like economic cooperation and family reunification.</p>
        <p>Never before have North and South Korea come this close to a normal, peaceful relationship. What has pushed them this far is a combination of severe economic and social strains in the North, including serious famine and energy shortages, and a new recognition by the South that its own security would be endangered by a sudden breakdown of authority in North Korea. That understanding has inspired President Kim Dae Jung's policy of actively engaging the North, an approach the Clinton administration has wisely supported.</p>

        <p>This week's meetings between South Korea's president, Kim Dae Jung, and North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, mark an encouraging change in the relationship between the two Koreas. In the 55 years since the Korean Peninsula was divided after World War II, the North has directed invasion, infiltration and terrorism against the South and both sides have employed vitriolic propaganda against each other. Now, for the first time, the top leaders on each side are getting together to discuss mutual concerns like economic cooperation and family reunification.</p>
        <p>Never before have North and South Korea come this close to a normal, peaceful relationship. What has pushed them this far is a combination of severe economic and social strains in the North, including serious famine and energy shortages, and a new recognition by the South that its own security would be endangered by a sudden breakdown of authority in North Korea. That understanding has inspired President Kim Dae Jung's policy of actively engaging the North, an approach the Clinton administration has wisely supported.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, North Korea's government remains one of the world's most opaque and unpredictable. Expectations for specific agreements coming out of the meetings should not be set too high.</p>
        <p>South Korea's main goals in these talks, which are scheduled to run through Thursday in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, include reaching agreement on additional high-level meetings, expanding economic exchanges and arranging for the reunification of millions of families divided since the Korean War. Many of these separated relatives are now elderly, adding some urgency to resolving this issue. South Korea will also bring up military and security issues of concern to the United States. The North must continue living up to its agreements with Washington to freeze its nuclear weapons program and to suspend all testing of long-range missiles.</p>
        <p>North Korea has recently been seeking to broaden its diplomatic contacts around the world. It has worked to upgrade its relations with Europe and Japan as well as South Korea and the United States. Last month Kim Jong Il met China's leaders in Beijing. Next month Vladimir Putin is scheduled to become the first top Russian leader ever to visit Pyongyang.</p>
        <p>North Korea's development of long-range missiles, coupled with its diplomatic aloofness and unpredictable behavior, was the leading reason behind the Clinton administration's efforts to develop defensive technologies capable of protecting the United States from a limited missile attack. Those concerns remain valid. But as North Korea begins to reach out from its self-imposed isolation, there are grounds for hoping that one day it may no longer need to be treated as a dangerous rogue state.</p>
