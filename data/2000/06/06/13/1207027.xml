        <p>Today's Supreme Court decision, rejecting a patient's lawsuit against a health maintenance organization, means that it is now up to Congress to decide whether patients gain new rights to sue H.M.O.'s for injuries they suffer at the hands of doctors and insurers.</p>

        <p>Today's Supreme Court decision, rejecting a patient's lawsuit against a health maintenance organization, means that it is now up to Congress to decide whether patients gain new rights to sue H.M.O.'s for injuries they suffer at the hands of doctors and insurers.</p>
        <p>In his opinion for a unanimous court, Justice David H. Souter said Congress had ''a superior institutional competence'' in deciding how to hold H.M.O.'s accountable. Congress, he said, is the ''preferable forum'' for deciding such complex questions.</p>
        <p>And where precisely does Congress stand? For five years, lawmakers have been wrestling with legislation to define patients' rights, and to establish remedies for the violation of such rights. The House has twice passed legislation, in 1998 and 1999, and the Senate passed a very different bill last year.</p>
        <p>Negotiators from the two chambers have been trying to resolve their differences since March 2, and they are within striking distance of a compromise on most issues. But Democrats from both chambers and conservative Republican senators have been unwilling to make the concessions that would probably be needed to clinch a deal.</p>
        <p>Democrats' frustration boiled over last week, when they went to the floor of the Senate and tried to attach the House-passed bill to an unrelated piece of legislation. The effort, blocked by a vote of 51 to 48, seemed at least temporarily to increase the rancor between the parties.</p>
        <p>But Democrats said it was still possible that the heat of a presidential election year would serve as a catalyst, making Republicans more willing to compromise. Democrats said they had no incentive for an early compromise because the issue played to their advantage on the campaign trail.</p>
        <p>The biggest differences between the House and the Senate involve two questions: How many people should be covered by new federal insurance standards? (The House bill covers three times as many people as some provisions of the Senate bill.) And should patients get any new rights to sue health plans for injuries caused by the denial of care?</p>
        <p>The Supreme Court today invited Congress to address the second question. For, it said, the existing federal law -- the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, known as Erisa -- did not allow a lawsuit in federal court by the plaintiff, Cynthia Herdrich, whose appendix ruptured before she could be tested at a distant hospital chosen by her H.M.O.</p>
        <p>Prof. Timothy S. Jost, an expert on health law at Ohio State University, said: ''Today's decision knocks the ball back to Congress. It also knocks the ball back to state courts.''</p>
        <p>Medical malpractice cases have historically been handled in state courts.</p>
        <p>Representative Charlie Norwood, a Georgia Republican who has worked closely with Democrats on a bill to define patients' rights, said the Supreme Court was virtually begging Congress to act.</p>
        <p>''The Supreme Court isn't just asking for Congressional action,'' Mr. Norwood said. ''The justices are shouting at the top of their lungs for us to act. The court's ruling does nothing to protect patients from H.M.O.'s that put profits ahead of patient care. That's why it's important that we send the president a bill that covers all Americans, provides a review process to challenge H.M.O. decisions and holds an H.M.O. accountable when it makes a decision that harms or kills someone.''</p>
        <p>Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said the House bill was clearly preferable because it included ''a prohibition on improper financial incentives by H.M.O.'s'' and would make it easier for patients to sue health plans.</p>
        <p>Members of Congress from both parties agree on one issue: all H.M.O.'s should establish appeals procedures, so patients can obtain an independent medical review of any decision to deny care or coverage.</p>
        <p>Karen M. Ignagni, president of the American Association of Health Plans, said H.M.O.'s agreed that such ''external review'' was desirable and could accept legislation to require it.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ignagni welcomed the Supreme Court decision, saying it ''validates the principle that courts are not the place to resolve disputes over health care.''</p>
        <p>H.M.O.'s never like to admit that they ration health care. But, the Supreme Court said, that is what they do, as an inherent part of their mission, blessed by Congress since 1973. ''No H.M.O. organization could survive without some incentive connecting physician reward with treatment rationing,'' Justice Souter wrote.</p>
