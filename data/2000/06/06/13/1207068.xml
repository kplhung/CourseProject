        <p>The chief executive of the country's largest cigarette maker took the stand today to defend his company, testifying that the tobacco industry had changed how it did business because the country had demanded it.</p>
        <p>Hoping to dissuade a Miami-Dade County jury from recommending a huge punitive judgment, the chief executive of Philip Morris Inc., Michael Szymanczyk, testified today that a series of lawsuits in the 1990's ''made it pretty clear the company was out of alignment with society's expectations of it.''</p>
        <p>''There was something wrong if all the states were suing us,'' Mr. Szymanczyk told the six-member jury, which has already awarded compensatory damages of $12.7 million in the class-action suit involving more than 300,000 smokers in Florida.</p>
        <p>''We wanted to fix that,'' said Mr. Szymanczyk, who was named president and chief executive at Philip Morris in 1997.</p>
        <p>Cigarette makers have paid $254 billion to settle lawsuits brought by the states' attorneys general and have spent billions more on programs to curb smoking by teenagers, he said.</p>
        <p>The tobacco industry cannot absorb the $100 billion judgment that the plaintiffs in the lawsuit here are asking, lawyers for the industry said.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for the plaintiffs said the companies could borrow money to cover such a judgment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Szymanczyk's presence on the witness stand today showed how determined the tobacco companies are to persuade the jury to deny the plaintiffs a potentially huge judgment.</p>
        <p>Top executives in the tobacco industry rarely testify in cases filed by smokers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Szymanczyk is only the first of five chief executives who are being called, by their own lawyers, to testify on what they see as a more socially responsible industry.</p>
        <p>Mr. Szymanczyk, 51, was to be followed by Andrew J. Schindler of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, Nicholas G. Brooks of Brown and Williamson Tobacco Corporation, Martin Orlowsky of Lorillard Tobacco Company and Bennett S. LeBow of Liggett Group Inc.</p>
        <p>In deciding against the companies in the compensatory stage of the lawsuit, which became essentially a trial on how big tobacco companies did business for decades, the jury had found that the industry committed fraud and conspired to sell a defective and dangerous product.</p>
        <p>Mr. Szymanczyk told the jury that his company had altered how it advertised its products, just one of the many changes in what he called a new corporate culture.</p>
        <p>He said Philip Morris had pledged in its ''mission statement'' to ''pursue a dialogue with government and public health agencies'' and ''discourage under-age use of the product.'' Employees have been given cards printed with those guidelines.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for the smokers have said the tobacco companies are merely trying to use slick public relations to avoid being punished in the courts and fought to prevent testimony by the executives.</p>
        <p>Stanley Rosenblatt, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said the way that Philip Morris and other companies did business today was not relevant to how much those companies should be punished for the way they did business in the past.</p>
        <p>But Daniel Webb, a lawyer for Philip Morris, argued that the company should be able to present evidence to show that it had changed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Szymanczyk talked all afternoon about those changes, specifically about how his company no longer advertised in magazines that might be read by children.</p>
        <p>''If there's one thing I would make go away altogether, it would be that,'' he said, referring to under-age smoking. Under-age smokers make up less than 1 percent of the company's business, he said.</p>
        <p>''The company is not going to be a successful company,'' he said, if it singles out young smokers.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for the smokers have challenged those efforts, saying they are a ploy to avoid a big judgment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Szymanczyk said the company  spent more money in 1999 on advertisements intended to discourage young smokers, $74.1 million, than it did in advertisements for its best-selling brand, Marlboro, $66.7 million.</p>
