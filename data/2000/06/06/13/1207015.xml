        <p>Critics of the government's antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft said that the company was already at risk from rapid changes in technology. But this criticism is misguided. In reality, emerging high-tech offerings make last week's court remedy in the Microsoft case all the more important.</p>
        <p>During the last decade, when the use of personal computers exploded and the Internet revolutionized computing, Microsoft's dominance of the P.C. operating systems market remained unchanged; Windows' market share climbed from 93 percent at the start of the decade to about 95 percent today. Indeed, the more high technology has changed, the more striking it is that Windows' monopoly market position has stayed the same.</p>
        <p>The reason is simple. As the federal court found, Microsoft repeatedly used its Windows monopoly to crush emerging threats presented by technologies like Netscape's browser and Sun's Java. These so-called middleware products had the potential to promote real operating-system competition.</p>
        <p>Today, some potential threats to Windows dominance come from small devices -- including personal digital assistants, like Palm Pilots -- and large networks of computers called servers. Through the Internet, small computing devices can draw on the data and computing power of large servers. For example, on your Palm Pilot, you can send and receive e-mail and and check the weather, stock quotes or other information coming from Internet servers.</p>
        <p>These new devices need to interconnect with the hundreds of millions of personal computers running Microsoft's Windows and its Office applications. So they depend on Microsoft for technical information for their products to work well with Windows and Office. That leaves Microsoft in a position once again to use its monopoly power to stop potential challengers.</p>
        <p>This is no mere hypothetical. Documents presented to the court confirmed that even after the conclusion of the trial, Microsoft's chairman stressed the importance of ensuring that Office did not work as well with Palm Pilots and other non-Microsoft personal digital assistants as it did with P.D.A.'s running Microsoft software, and he raised the possibility of changing critical Office features so that they would not work with the other P.D.A.'s. Indeed, in last week's ruling, the federal court referred to evidence that Microsoft ''continues to do business as it has in the past, and may yet do to other markets what it has already done in the P.C. operating system and browser markets.''</p>
        <p>The remedy ordered by the court will prevent Microsoft from stifling these new technologies. Separating Windows and the applications business into different companies will give both firms the incentive to respond to market forces and compete with each other by supporting, rather than crushing, new technologies.  For example, the applications company will have the incentive to make Office work well not only with Palm Pilots, but with personal computers running Linux and other operating systems. And the Windows company will have the incentive to make everyone's applications work as well with Windows as Microsoft's applications now do.</p>
        <p>The result will be real competition both in operating systems and in applications -- and increased innovation, better products and more choices for consumers.</p>
