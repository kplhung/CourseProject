      <dateline>LONDON, June 12  No country has built more ambitious Millennium projects than Britain, and Prime Minister Tony Blair has counted on their becoming sleek symbols of the contemporary big-embrace form of government he promised the country. But the opening this weekend of the latest showcase provided quite a different kind of metaphor.
&lt;p&gt;
 The $28 million footbridge across the Thames designed by Britain's leading architect, Norman Foster, is a New Labor icon, a high-tech aluminum and stainless steel walkway with an untraditional suspension system. It unites the new riverside Tate Modern gallery with the old stolid Georgian and Victorian buildings of the City of London financial district and St. Paul's Cathedral.

      <abstract>
        <p>New $28 million Millennium Bridge across Thames in London, which swayed violently during inauguration ceremonies forcing closure pending further engineering studies, has become metaphor for wobbling popularity of Prime Min Tony Blair, whose government has been buffeted by series of events in recent weeks that have caused once stratospheric approval ratings to swoon and his three-year-old administration to lose public trust; Blair is finding he can no longer ride on Labor Party's hard-won reputation for competence as he is being held responsible at start of fourth year in job for failure of his social programs to produce more immediate gains; aggressive British press is uniformly reporting that he has lost his grip; photo (M)</p>

        <p>When the first arrivals swarmed onto the span on Saturday, it began to sway and bounce violently, causing people to stumble and lurch about.  Access was promptly restricted, and tonight the bridge was closed for at least the rest of the month while emergency engineering work continues to see whether major repairs are needed.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the Millennium Bridge Trust was initially defensive when asked what the problem was. ''It's meant to wobble,'' he said. Then he added, ''It is moving in a way that it should not move, and at the moment we do not know why that is.''</p>
        <p>A similar attitude of confusion and dismay has seized 10 Downing Street as the Blair government has been buffeted by a series of events in recent weeks that have caused the prime minister's once stratospheric popularity figures to swoon and his three-year-old administration to lose public trust. Labor politicians have expressed alarm at the sudden wobble in the smooth-running administration, and there are calls on Mr. Blair to adjust his approach. According to the new surveys, Mr. Blair, until now the most popular prime minister in British history, is being perceived as distant, controlling and smug.</p>
        <p>Compounding Mr. Blair's problems is that just as he has been losing his touch, William Hague, the Conservative leader who has struggled to make a mark since taking over the party from former Prime Minister John Major three years ago, has been finding his voice. Mr. Hague has seized upon emotive issues like tougher action against asylum-seekers, more protection for homeowners who attack burglars, and reduced increases in pensions, and the Blair government has been cast onto the defensive.</p>
        <p>In The Mail on Sunday, the well-regarded MORI survey showed Mr. Hague only three points behind Mr. Blair, the first time he had ever broken out of double-digit trailing margins. Also for the first time, Mr. Hague is being talked about as a serious competitor in the national election expected next year.</p>
        <p>The survey took place after a humiliating episode last week when Mr. Blair found himself heckled into awkward silence by the 10,000 people attending the convention of the Women's Institute, the rural service organization known for its allegiance to ''jam and Jerusalem'' -- home-bottled preserves from English country kitchens and the Blake poem enshrining ''England's green and pleasant land.'' The women complained that the speech was too political and patronizing.</p>
        <p>The image of a prime minister facing a disapproving crowd of provincial women and not being able to do anything about it but grin sheepishly was displayed across the front pages of newspapers and played repeatedly on television. It was Mr. Blair's first appearance since returning to work after two weeks of time at home with his wife, Cherie, and newborn son, Leo, and it damaged his claim of being sensitive to the concerns of middle England rather than just the ''liberal elite'' that Mr. Hague has accused him of favoring.</p>
        <p>Emboldened, Mr. Hague laid into the prime minister, declaring him ''the most out-of-touch, arrogant, opportunistic, remote prime minister we've every had.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Blair is finding that he can no longer ride on his party's hard-won reputation for competence, an early goal of his to separate the British public from its traditional suspicion, based on the performance of past Labor governments, that the party could not be trusted to run the country. Starting his fourth year as prime minister, Mr. Blair is being held responsible for the failure of his social programs to produce more immediate gains, and the aggressive British press is uniformly reporting that he has lost his grip.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blair's press spokesman, Alastair Campbell, said today that it was ''business as usual'' at 10 Downing Sreet and that the prime minister was paying no attention to the papers. It was probably just as well since their front pages have been carrying headlines like ''Rattled,'' ''Blair Is Clapped Out'' and, in reference to his savaging by the Women's Institute delegates, ''Handbagged.''</p>
        <p>Roy Hattersley, a former deputy leader of the party, faulted Mr. Blair for trying to appeal to too broad a gamut of the public.</p>
        <p>''The tent is now so big that all we hear is canvas flapping in the wind,'' he wrote in today's Guardian. Michael Meacher, the Environment Minister, said the government's policies remained right but the presentation was flawed. ''I think we are under pressure now, and we have got to make those facts clear in an unvarnished, straight, clear and honest manner,'' he told a breakfast television show.</p>
        <p>The government has fought back with a populist assault on Oxford and Cambridge based on questionable evidence that they practice class-conscious admissions policies. The debate was prompted by the case of a young woman from a state school in the North who was denied entry to Magdalen College but got a full scholarship from Harvard. In a second effort to placate internal critics,  the government announced today that it would move more aggressively in Parliament to obtain a ban on hunting with hounds, a popular issue with the Labor left.</p>
        <p>What is happening seems not to be in doubt, if what it means still is.</p>
        <p>''Something is going wrong with this government,'' the left-of-center Guardian said in an editorial. ''Friends of Labor will hope this is only a bad case of mid-term blues, but the patient is looking very peaky.''</p>
        <p>Labor can only wish that a prediction by Lord Foster about the future of his bridge comes true for them. ''I don't want to minimize the issues that are at stake,'' he said today, ''but there's going to be a point when everyone can look back on this as a hiccup.''</p>
