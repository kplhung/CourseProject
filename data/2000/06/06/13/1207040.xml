        <p>Government antitrust officials began efforts yesterday to prove in court that Visa and MasterCard, the world's two biggest credit card networks, limit competition with each other and their rivals to the detriment of consumers.</p>
        <p>The outcome of the case could force changes in the structures of Visa and MasterCard, which together control about 75 percent of the $1.3 trillion market, and transform how competitors like the American Express Company operate.</p>
        <p>Government lawyers introduced what they contend is damaging evidence from internal Visa and MasterCard documents and from letters and depositions that they say undermine the companies' assertions of broad and vigorous competition.</p>
        <p>Both yesterday and in a pretrial hearing last Thursday, Visa and MasterCard pointed to the way that the banks that use their networks continue to flood consumers' mailboxes with credit card offers, four billion of them last year.</p>
        <p>But Melvin A. Schwarz, the Justice Department's lead lawyer in the case, insisted that no amount of competition among the thousands of banks that issue the cards could substitute for meaningful competition between the Visa and MasterCard networks that provide advertising, technical and other support.</p>
        <p>The heavily lobbied case, which was first filed by the government in October 1998 and is expected to take up to two months at trial, is being heard by Federal District Judge Barbara S. Jones, who will decide the case without a jury.</p>
        <p>After both sides made opening statements, she called on the first of a long parade of witnesses who are expected to appear.</p>
        <p>The government's focus is on two points that it says stifle competition.</p>
        <p>One is that each network is controlled by the same group of large banks, a situation known as ''dual governance'' that the government contends means that the networks have no incentive to create products that would benefit consumers.</p>
        <p>For example, Mr. Schwarz said, it took almost 15 years for the industry to introduce a so-called smart card, which contains a computer chip, and even then its creator was American Express, not Visa, MasterCard or the third defendant, Visa International, the overseas unit of Visa, which the company says operates with considerable independence.</p>
        <p>The other main target is a rule of Visa and MasterCard that bars member banks from issuing cards of rivals like American Express, Discover and Diners Club.</p>
        <p>American Express, with virtually no bank outlets for its cards, has sided prominently with the government, drawing criticism from Visa that American Express is the real instigator of the government's suit. Both American Express and the Justice Department, which says it has been watching the credit card networks for a decade, deny that.</p>
        <p>The two card networks defend both dual governance and the rules on exclusivity, but MasterCard fears the loss of dual governance more than Visa because it is the smaller, more vulnerable, of the two and could lose business if it lost representation on Visa's board.</p>
        <p>In his opening statement for MasterCard, Kenneth Gallo said the government was creating ''a misimpression'' of how the industry works, comparing selected evidence of misbehavior to trying to depict Michael Jordan as uncompetitive by showing a film clip of him with his arm around a defeated opponent.</p>
        <p>Intensive study of smart cards in the 1980's, he contended, showed that they would cost $1 billion to introduce and that MasterCard would lose money for a decade. Mr. Gallo said he would show that the American Express smart card is based on a system, Mondex, that MasterCard originally bought and that the association thus actually promoted the creation of products.</p>
        <p>To show that MasterCard and Visa do not act in concert even though they have the same multiple parents, Mr. Gallo described how MasterCard derailed a plan in which Visa and the Microsoft Corporation were developing a technical protocol that would have produced a fee to Microsoft for every card transaction.</p>
        <p>''Dual governance has promoted competition,'' Mr. Gallo said, and abolishing it would help American Express and risk MasterCard's position relative to its larger ally, Visa.</p>
        <p>Laurence Popofsky, a lawyer for Visa, said that the government in 1975 accepted the trade-offs involved in the lack of innovation implied by dual governance in exchange for supporting a fledgling industry. He went on to complained that the government now sought to reorganize the industry with a case based on ''historic revisionism.''</p>
        <p>As for Visa International, Eugene Bannigan argued, among other things, that the supposed success American Express had enjoyed marketing its cards abroad, where network rules do not apply, had fallen far short of projections and, in France, the company had benefited from government subsidies.</p>
        <p>Outside of the proceedings, Michael O'Neill, a spokesman for American Express, did not dispute that statement but said that its 60 or so overseas partners had experienced a 30 percent increase in transaction volume last year.</p>
        <p>Among the documents introduced by Mr. Schwarz, the chief government lawyer, was one from a hearing in which Bennett Katz, then Visa's general counsel, told the Federal Trade Commission that dual governance blunted innovation in credit cards. ''I think it has a slowdown effect,'' Mr. Katz said.</p>
        <p>And an internal Visa analysis supporting an effort to extend to Europe its rule barring member banks from issuing American Express cards projected that American Express would be a far more effective competitor if Visa did not have this protection, with Visa members losing significant market share.</p>
        <p>The government also introduced the 1991 deposition of William Powar, a Visa official, in which he was asked what proposals members did not carry out because of the inhibitions of dual governance.</p>
        <p>''We often don't even propose them because we know they are unacceptable to members,'' Mr. Powar said.</p>
