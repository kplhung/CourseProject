        <p>A Brooklyn priest was arrested last night and charged with sodomizing a 14-year-old boy in the rectory and sexually abusing him repeatedly over the course of more than a year, the police said.</p>
        <p>The priest, the Rev. Frank J. Capelludo, 52, of Our Lady of Lourdes Roman Catholic Church in Bushwick, was charged with sodomy and ''numerous counts'' of sexual abuse, said Sgt. Elias Nikas, a police spokesman.</p>
        <p>Sergeant Nikas said that Father Capelludo's improper contact with the boy started in April 1999. All of the sexual contact occurred in the rectory, at 11 DeSales Place. The church itself burned down several years ago, and Our Lady of Lourdes has been holding services at another church, detectives said.</p>
        <p>Investigators were unclear last night how the assault affected the boy. An investigator said that the boy ''was a little slow to begin with.''</p>
        <p>Father Capelludo was arrested at 8:30 p.m. after going to the 83rd Precinct station house for questioning, Sergeant Nikas said.</p>
        <p>At least one other possible victim, a 15-year-old boy, is also being interviewed, but no charges have been filed in that case, an investigator said.</p>
