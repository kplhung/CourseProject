        <p>Rats, mice and roaches have always been a curse for residents of low-income neighborhoods. But an increasingly common remedy can be worse than the disease: illegal pesticides.</p>
        <p>They are sold on the street, coarse powders with names like Tres Pasitos, Tempo and Chinese Chalk, and federal authorities are investigating their distribution. The powders are far more toxic than over-the-counter pesticides. They are highly effective, and many parents in places with heavy concentrations of asthma, like the South Bronx and Washington Heights, rely on them to protect their children from roaches, which can aggravate asthma.</p>
        <p>Yet the street pesticides themselves can exacerbate asthma. If eaten, they can be fatal. ''My concern is you could eat it and die, and the symptoms would be the same as the underlying condition,'' said Dr. Steven Frantz, a State Health Department research scientist who has investigated illegal pesticide use in New York.</p>
        <p>The substances are particularly dangerous to children, he added, since they are often mixed with rice and placed on the floor.</p>
        <p>The pesticides' active ingredients are registered for some uses in the United States, mostly agricultural. One of them, Tempo, is a trademarked pesticide that can be used legally by licensed exterminators. But it is being used in these neighborhoods at 200 to 400 times the recommended dosage, Dr. Frantz said.</p>
        <p>The pesticides' use is particularly common in Hispanic neighborhoods. ''You just go walking in certain areas and you see people selling it,'' said Amy Rosado, a resident of the Highbridge neighborhood in the Bronx who works for the Urban Homesteading Assistance Board, a nonprofit organization that has worked with Dr. Frantz to curb illegal pesticide use.</p>
        <p>Tres Pasitos is the strongest of the pesticides: its name, which means Three Little Steps, supposedly refers to all that mice can manage after eating it. It appears to be imported illegally from Mexico, the Dominican Republic and other Latin American countries, said Nina Habib Spencer, a spokeswoman for the federal Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
        <p>The federal agency has been investigating illegal pesticide use in New York City and New Jersey over the past year and is trying to track down a large distributor, Ms. Habib Spencer said. The agency is also planning a public campaign to warn New Yorkers about the dangers the pesticides pose.</p>
        <p>The active ingredient in Tres Pasitos is aldicarb, a neurotoxin that is registered for some agricultural uses. On the federal agency's scale of toxicity, which runs from 1 at the strongest through 4 at the weakest, aldicarb rates a 1.</p>
        <p>A pesticide commonly used in over-the-counter roach sprays, chlorpyrifos, which was banned by the federal agency on Thursday, rates a 2. Malathion, the pesticide that caused some concern when it was sprayed in the New York area last summer to combat mosquitoes carrying the West Nile virus, rates a 3. In low doses, aldicarb can cause blurred vision and tremors. In higher doses, it can paralyze the respiratory system and cause death. The active ingredient in Tempo, cyfluthrin, can also be lethal, Ms. Habib Spencer said.</p>
        <p>The street pesticides' link to asthma has been a particular concern for housing advocates and health workers in low-income areas of the city. ''There has been a lot of attention paid to the notion that there's a relationship between cockroach presence and asthma attacks in children,'' said Dr. Irwin Redlener, the president of the Children's Hospital at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. ''These are families that by and large don't have the resources to call a traditional exterminator. They would do almost anything to get rid of the roaches.''</p>
        <p>As of 1993, New York City children were being hospitalized for asthma at more than four times the national rate, according to the Children's Health Fund, a private, nonprofit advocacy group. In the highest-risk areas, which include the South Bronx, upper Manhattan, and central and north Brooklyn, between 8.6 and 14 percent of all children, hospitalized and not hospitalized, have asthma, compared with a national rate of 6 percent.</p>
        <p>The New York City Poison Control Center receives about a call a month on poisonings from Tres Pasitos, a spokeswoman, Sandra Mullin, said. The rate has increased moderately since the first poisonings were reported in the early 1990's, she said.</p>
        <p>Tempo is a trademarked name for a pesticide that is legal when used by professional exterminators. It is manufactured by the Bayer Corporation, and it is meant to be diluted with water and sprayed, said Greg Coffey, a Bayer spokesman.</p>
        <p>However, most people who buy Tempo illegally on the street simply spread it on the floor, where children and pets can get it, Ms. Rosado said.</p>
        <p>Chinese Chalk, also known as Miraculous Chalk, is less common and less dangerous than Tempo and Tres Pasitos. Its active ingredient varies. However, since it usually resembles chalk, children often try to use it or eat it, Dr. Frantz said.</p>
        <p>The state attorney general's office has pursued several illegal pesticide cases in recent years, including one involving Chinese Chalk, said Dr. Michael Surgan, the chief scientist in the state attorney general's environmental protection bureau in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Another potentially lethal pesticide that has been used in low-income neighborhoods is methyl parathion. Often used to kill boll weevils on cotton plants, methyl parathion is heavily regulated but continues to be used illegally in homes, Ms. Habib Spencer said.</p>
        <p>When homes and businesses in Lorain County, Ohio, were found to be contaminated with methyl parathion in 1994, the federal agency declared the area a Superfund site, and more than $20 million was spent to clean the buildings. In a similar incident in Jackson County, Miss., more than 900 homes contaminated with methyl parathion had to be cleaned at a cost of more than $50 million.</p>
        <p>There are many safe and effective alternatives for pest removal, said Dr. Frantz, who is preparing a handbook on the alternatives with the Urban Homesteading Assistance Board. They include boric acid powder, sealing and caulking outlets, good sanitation, and limited and careful use of legal pesticides.</p>
