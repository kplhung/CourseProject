        <p>When Jalen Rose was growing up in Detroit, honing his skills on the city's playgrounds, Magic Johnson was the player he chose to emulate. He would use Magic Marker to write Johnson's No. 32 on an undershirt, put it on and then imitate the moves of the Los Angeles Lakers' 6-foot-8-inch point guard. Naturally, having Magic as his idol meant that Larry Bird was always the enemy.</p>
        <p>In those days, when Rose imagined himself defeating Bird, he never dreamed that the Boston Celtics legend would help make him a National Basketball Association star.</p>
        <p>''It's ironic how things happen,'' Rose said today after the Pacers practiced for Wednesday's Game 4 of their finals series with the Los Angeles Lakers. ''I call my situation with Larry Bird kind of like poetic justice. I grew up rooting against him my entire life, rooting for Magic. Now I'm playing with Larry, and Magic's rooting against me. With that being said, I really appreciate what Larry has done for me as far as giving me the opportunity to play.''</p>
        <p>Just as they were in Rose's wildest dreams, the three are again sharing the stage of the N.B.A. finals -- Rose as the Indiana Pacers' terrific young forward, Bird as his coach and Johnson as a part owner of the Lakers.</p>
        <p>Before Bird took over on the Pacers' bench three years ago, Rose was roundly viewed as a disappointment. A former playmaker for the Fab Five at Michigan, Rose had spent three seasons in the N.B.A. struggling as a mediocre point guard. The 1996-1997 season, the year before Bird arrived, was the worst, as Rose played only 18 minutes a game while often being berated by Coach Larry Brown for his perceived cockiness.</p>
        <p>''He didn't hit it off with me from Day 1,'' Rose said of his relationship with Brown. ''So what I did, as opposed to just crying out to the public, I just kept working on my game. I stayed away from the world, pretty much. I cut off my phone. I didn't want to hear nobody's opinion of what was going on. I didn't want nobody to come and watch me play that year. It was kind of like I was in jail that season, so I just did my time and now I'm out.''</p>
        <p>After increasing Rose's minutes upon arriving in Indiana, Bird made Rose a starter this season. It was the move that is perhaps most responsible for the Pacers' first trip to the finals, and certainly the chance Rose needed to be named most improved player. After averaging 11.1 points on 40.3 percent shooting last season, Rose led the Pacers in scoring this season, averaging 18.2 points on 47.1 percent shooting.</p>
        <p>In the playoffs, Rose has averaged 20.2 points and a team-best 41.7 minutes a game. And after scoring only 12 points in Game 1 against the Lakers, Rose has scored 51 points in the last two games, including 21 in Sunday's 100-91 victory. In that game, he set the tone by scoring 8 points in the first 8 minutes to give the Pacers' a 19-10 lead.</p>
        <p>Rose will be one of the most sought after free agents this summer, and many people believe he will wind up in his hometown playing for the Detroit Pistons. Donnie Walsh, the Pacers' president, has said that signing Rose will be the team's priority this off-season, and Rose is not ruling out  coming back.</p>
        <p>The Pacers' assistant coach, Rick Carlisle, called Rose one of the most confident people he has met.</p>
        <p>''The one thing about him is that he's a joyous kid,'' Carlisle said. ''He's an upbeat, positive thinker. Not many people know this, but when he was sitting on the bench in Indiana and in Denver, he was spending a lot of time by himself in some deserted gym just working on his game, dreaming about being on this sort of stage.''</p>
        <p>Bird, who has said he will retire after this season, was blunt when asked what Rose needed to do to become a franchise player.</p>
        <p>''His concentration is key,'' Bird said. ''If he could concentrate through practices and games, I think his game would improve 15, 20 percent. And that would put him over the top. Some days in practice, he's just not there. He won't work on his game as hard as I would like him to. One of Jalen's problems is he doesn't think anybody can guard him. But they can. But I have great respect for the kid. I like him. That's why I play him.''</p>
        <p>Rose disagrees with Bird's assessment of his work habits, but does not let that affect his opinion of Bird. When asked how much he will miss playing for Bird, Rose said, ''If it was up to me, he'd coach or be a part of the organization until I retired.'' Rose never dreamed he would say that as a youngster in Detroit.</p>
