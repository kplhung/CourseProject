        <p>MANHATTAN: GRACIE MANSION RULING  A federal judge in Manhattan ordered New York City yesterday to allow a group of protesters to sleep on the sidewalk across from Gracie Mansion, provided that they obey certain conditions. City lawyers had said the protesters would be violating the disorderly conduct law. Judge Kimba M. Wood of United States District Court ruled that the protesters, who object to proposed rent increases for rent-controlled apartments, would be exercising their First Amendment rights. But she said that they must not block the sidewalk. The demonstration is planned for Thursday night.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: SUPPORT FOR JANITORS  City Councilman Guillermo Linares, left, has told 30 janitors on strike at a Brooklyn office building that he will introduce a bill to ban city subsidies for building owners who pay poverty-level wages and do not provide health insurance or other basic benefits. The janitors are on strike against Muss Development, which runs Brooklyn Renaissance Plaza, an office tower that has received city tax abatements. The janitors, who earn $6.50 an hour, are seeking to join Local 32B-32J of the Service Employees International Union.Steven Greenhouse (NYT)</p>
        <p>MANHATTAN: PAINTERS END STRIKE  The International Union of Painters and Allied Trades ended a weeklong strike yesterday by voting to accept a five-year contract with the Association of Master Painters and Decorators of New York. The new contract increases the wages and benefits for union painters each year to $49 an hour in the fifth year, from $41 now. It also removes restrictions on the use of spray paint and creates a new local to recover work lost to nonunion painters. The new local would have a much lower wage and benefit scale, and the workers would be used in buildings that now use nonunion painters.</p>

        <p>ALBANY: DEBT ASSESSMENT  In recognition of New York State's new plan to trim its debt, Moody's Investors Service yesterday upgraded the outlook on the state's credit rating, a step short of raising the rating itself and lowering New York's interest costs. Moody's rates New York's general obligation bonds at A2, lower than any state except Louisiana. Yesterday, the firm raised the outlook on those bonds from ''stable'' to ''positive,'' indicating that the rating could improve. New York has more tax-supported debt, about $37 billion, than any other state.</p>

        <p>PARAMUS: NO SPRAYING SCHEDULED  Bergen County announced yesterday that it would not carry out aerial spraying to kill adult mosquitoes, although one of the season's first cases of West Nile virus was confirmed Friday in a crow found dead in River Edge. Rather, to avoid any health risk from spraying, the county will continue its other efforts to control the mosquito population, which include clearing catch basins and the spot treatment of potential breeding grounds, said Thom Ammirato, a county spokesman. He said four more dead crows had been found and sent to Trenton since Friday, when the virus was confirmed in two crows found dead in New City, N.Y.</p>

        <p>WAYNE: KIDNAP VICTIM FOUND  A 51-year-old widow believed kidnapped by a former boyfriend from a supermarket parking lot Friday night was found unharmed yesterday in an airport in Des Moines, the police in Wayne said. The suspect, James Allan, 39, was arrested without incident and charged with kidnapping the woman, Linda Gazda, of West Paterson, said Lt. John Reardon. After an airline clerk refused to allow them to board a jet for Las Vegas, Mr. Allan called a lawyer, who took him and Ms. Gazda to the Des Moines police. A computer check turned up warrants for Mr. Allan's arrest. He said Ms. Gazda had willingly accompanied him; she said he had abducted her at gunpoint, Lieutenant Reardon said.</p>

        <p>PATERSON: PRISONER FREED  A man whose murder conviction was overturned in 1995 and whose two subsequent trials ended in hung juries was freed yesterday after 23 years in jail when the Passaic County prosecutor's office declined to seek a fourth trial. The prisoner, Lawrence L. Simmons, 43, maintains that he is innocent of the 1977 fatal beating of a well-known Paterson physician, and years ago refused a deal that would have freed him with time served in return for a guilty plea, said one of his lawyers, Miles Feinstein. At a hearing yesterday, Judge Sylvan G. Rothenberg of State Superior Court dismissed the indictment after Steven J. Brizek, an assistant prosecutor, said that his office would not appeal to the State Supreme Court. The prosecutor, Ronald S. Fava, said that a conviction in a fourth trial would not have kept Mr. Simmons in prison, since he had already served more time than he could receive at sentencing.</p>

        <p>TRENTON: PRISONER TRANSFER  A New Jersey appeals court has delayed the immediate transfer of Thomas Trantino, left, the convicted killer of two Lodi police officers in 1963, from prison to a halfway house. At the request of the state attorney general, John J. Farmer, the court set a new deadline of Monday, but refused to disturb its order of last Friday that Mr. Trantino be paroled by July 9. Mr. Farmer said he would ask the State Supreme Court today to review the Trantino ruling. Over the last 20 years, the state parole board has rejected all nine parole applications Mr. Trantino has filed. The appeals court ruling issued last Friday rejected as unreasonable the latest rejection of Mr. Trantino's parole in June.</p>

        <p>NEW HAVEN: STREETLIGHT CAMERAS  The city's Department of Traffic and Parking is installing cameras at intersections that will capture still frames of cars that run red lights. When drivers cause an accident by disobeying the signal, the city will issue still prints of the film to insurance companies. The movable cameras will be mounted on traffic lights and will operate 24 hours a day. Civil libertarians argue that privacy will be compromised.</p>
