        <p>For Jesse Reed, 67, washing the dishes is a thrill.</p>
        <p>For Janis Keeney, 43, switching a light on or off is so satisfying.</p>
        <p>And James Faust, 65, is grateful every time he mows his lawn.</p>
        <p>All three are stroke survivors who have gone through a promising therapy here at the University of Alabama-Birmingham's Spain Rehabilitation Clinic that has helped them regain use of their disabled arms to varying degrees.</p>
        <p>''I had completely written my arm off,'' said Mr. Faust, who had a stroke in 1993 that disabled the right side of his body. ''I just quit using it because it wouldn't do what I wanted it to do. I had deep thoughts about having it amputated to get it out of my way.''</p>
        <p>But then his wife read an ad about experimental rehabilitation called constraint-induced movement therapy for stroke survivors. So in 1995 Mr. Faust became a research subject.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reed, who had a stroke that disabled his left side in 1994, also joined the study in 1995. Mr. Reed said that before the therapy, his left arm ''was just a limb that was hanging on my body, but they got me to program in my mind that this hand and limb could be used again.''</p>
        <p>That reprogramming of the brain is the point of constraint-induced therapy. In a new study of the technique, conducted in Germany and described in this month's issue of Stroke: Journal of the American Heart Association, scientists showed for the first time that the brain could reorganize itself after a stroke. Researchers made a map of the area of the brain that controlled arm movement on the injured side of the body in 13 stroke survivors, and found that after the two-  to three-week therapy, not only was use returning to the arms but that the mapped area of the brain had nearly doubled in size.</p>
        <p>The study emphasized, though, that the therapy succeeded only if patients worked at it full time, as Mr. Faust did. Researchers believe that part of what causes the disability is that the patients have learned not to use the limb and that only through intense use will the the brain be sufficiently rewired.</p>
        <p>During two weeks of work with a physical therapist six hours a day, five days a week at the clinic, Mr. Faust said, his able left arm was immobilized in a sling, and his left hand was in a large mitten, forcing him to perform simple tasks with his disabled right arm. He began by turning over index cards and moving checkers onto squares.</p>
        <p>''I didn't tell any difference until about the third day,'' Mr. Faust said. ''And then there was a sensation in my arm that I hadn't had. I felt a little tingling. It was like my nerves were waking up.''</p>
        <p>Then he graduated to threading a shoelace through holes and moving washers up and down on screws.</p>
        <p>Working at the clinic and on his own at home on weekends, he began to regain use of the arm and to do things he thought he might never do again, like eating dinner holding the fork with his right hand, just as he had done before the stroke.</p>
        <p>Dr. Edward Taub leads the constraint-induced therapy research in the clinical psychology department at the University of Alabama and was also one of the authors of the recent study in Germany.</p>
        <p>His research assistant in Alabama, Gitendra Uswatte, said the stroke survivors were divided into four categories, depending on the severity of injury.</p>
        <p>Mr. Faust was in the first quarter who started out with the most ability. Mr. Reed was in the second quarter. Mr. Faust estimated that his arm had now recovered about 95 percent of its use. Mr. Reed said that he thought his arm had regained 65 percent to 70 percent of its use, and that while he used to do the dishes just to help his wife, now he liked doing them more because he considered it part of his therapy.</p>
        <p>Janis Keeney was in the third quarter of stroke survivors in the studies. Starting out with very limited ability, she said the therapy had brought ''not great improvement'' but enough to change her life.</p>
        <p>Ms. Keeney's stroke occurred in 1997, when she was 40 and the mother of an 8-month-old girl and a 2-year-old boy. ''Before the therapy,'' she said, ''it was hard to hold them in my lap because I needed both hands. But now I can hold my children.''</p>
        <p>A former engineer, Ms. Kenney has come to appreciate her ability to do even the simplest tasks, like switching on a light or opening a dresser drawer.</p>
        <p>Although more research needs to be done before this therapy will be widely accepted, a new private clinic is scheduled to open in Birmingham this fall to provide constraint-induced therapy to stroke survivors. Other researchers also say that more studies need to be done because the number of people in this study was so small and participants were not compared with a control group.</p>
        <p>Some trials of the therapy are being started by the National Institutes of Health. For information, call (205) 975-9799.</p>
        <p>The University of Alabama is also studying the use of constraint therapy on legs. And there are also trials being conducted here on the effectiveness of this type of therapy for those who have lost the use of a limb after traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury and hip fractures.</p>
        <p>''It's certainly not just for folks who have had strokes,'' said Jean E. Crago, a physical therapist at the university who has worked with Dr. Taub on this therapy. ''We see it as for anyone who for whatever reason is not using a limb or a body part optimally.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Faust is such a believer that he has taken part in the experimental therapy for his leg as well. That, he said, is why he longer walks with a cane. ''The doctors weren't sure I would make it through the night when I had my stroke,'' he said. ''Now, I manage to mow my grass -- and I've got almost two acres.''</p>
