        <p>Dallas is a monument to bigness in concrete, steel and glass. Even the Dallas Museum of Art is a hunkering bulk, a symbol of the civic value assigned to its high-aesthetic mission. Still, it is often the programming of some of the smaller arts venues that makes its mark on the city's cultural scene.</p>
        <p>The McKinney Avenue Contemporary, a relatively new arts center known as the MAC, recently concluded a mini-retrospective of the singular work of Valton Tyler, a Texan, for example, and the Valley House Gallery, an older commercial gallery, has a selection of his early and mid-career canvases on view through the summer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tyler, hitherto one of the region's best-known unknown artists, was the subject of ''Valton Tyler: Visionary Landscapes,'' at the MAC, and visionary seems the right word for describing his vivid, unusual and technically refined paintings, prints and drawings, whose style defies  convenient labels. Abstract, surreal, cartoonish, sci-fi fantastic, metaphysical, apocalyptic-Baroque -- all of these fit but also fall short of fully describing his art.</p>
        <p>Sometimes Mr. Tyler has been called an outsider artist, a suggestion that he is an untrained visionary talent working outside -- or in ignorance of -- the mainstream market. ''Although Valton is essentially self-taught, stylistically he is not what we'd expect of an outsider,'' said Murray Smither, the curator of the MAC's Tyler show.</p>
        <p>''Tyler's technical skill is much more sophisticated than what we're used to seeing in this field, said Mr. Smither, an art dealer, collector and curator who is considered an expert on Texan folk art and regional outsider art. ''And his subject matter isn't angels or human figures. It's unique, even bizarre.'' Some of his shapes have a mechanical or architectural air; others suggest Star Trek spaceship designs on steroids, or robotic-vegetal growths from a futuristic Amazon.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tyler, who was born in 1944, grew up in Texas City near Galveston. The oil industry dominated the town. His father ran an auto-body shop and was a skilled mixer of car paint; he also painted landscapes for pleasure.</p>
        <p>''I'll never forget the rigs, the oil refinery,'' he said in an interview at his home in Dallas. ''When I was 3, the refinery accidentally exploded, turning the sky red and black. It was terrifying.''</p>
        <p>He said that his childhood environment was reflected in the lush, looming thickets of strange forms he conjures in paint. ''I don't see my shapes as being not of this world,'' Mr. Tyler said, adding: ''They're not exactly fantasy. They could actually be built with the right technology. Everything about them is real to me. They take on human feelings, and I try to express that.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Tyler dropped out of high school, later earned his equivalency diploma, and was briefly enrolled at the Dallas Art Institute, although he rarely attended. ''It was a social gathering, and I wasn't interested in their commercial art,'' he said. In his early 20's Mr. Tyler made drawings and scattered them about the city at night in the hope that they would be gone in the morning, a sign, he assumed, that people had liked them enough to take them. Around this time he met Lucille Teasel, a Canadian-born antiques dealer who gave him a work space and art supplies in exchange for help with odd jobs around her shop.</p>
        <p>''After all these years, I still don't understand Valton's art,'' said Mrs. Teasel, 94. ''Sometimes I don't even like it. But I know he's good at it and that he has to do it. He is someone who has to paint.''</p>
        <p>In 1970 Mr. Tyler's drawings were shown to Donald Vogel, a painter and founder of Dallas's Valley House Gallery. ''I immediately recognized Valton's talent,'' Mr. Vogel said. ''His drawings showed he was a natural graphic artist.''</p>
        <p>The art dealer began buying whatever the young artist produced and arranged for him to use printmaking studios at Southern Methodist University.</p>
        <p>Within about a year, Mr. Tyler had created a series of 50 etchings and  mastered several demanding printmaking techniques. Then he turned to painting. ''Each time he brought in a new canvas, it was like Christmas,'' Mr. Vogel fondly recalled. Since leaving Valley House a decade ago, Mr. Tyler has worked on private commissions, including several for the Dallas-based entrepreneur and collector Claude C. Albritton III, the MAC's founder.</p>
        <p>Over the years, his work has popped up in assorted solo and group shows, but until now its category-defying nature has made it difficult for some viewers to grasp and easy for critics to dismiss. Mr. Vogel's son Kevin, who now runs Valley House, said, ''There's something so primal about Valton's urge or need to paint and about the mixed emotions and sense of power, life force or energy that his work expresses that just might be hard for some folks to take.''</p>
        <p>But the artist, allowing himself to think big in true Texas fashion, says: ''What I really want to aim for now is a New York show.''</p>
