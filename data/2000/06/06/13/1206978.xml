        <p>Preventive medicine often involves making a best guess based on less than complete scientific information. So it was with smoking, when people were advised to quit long before there was incontrovertible proof that it caused cancer. So it was also with cholesterol, when people were told to lower their blood levels long before research showed that doing so prevented heart attacks.</p>
        <p>And so it is now with homocysteine, an amino acid in blood that when elevated has been linked to heart attacks and strokes as well as a host of other health problems, from miscarriage to Alzheimer's disease.</p>
        <p>While more than a dozen studies have found that people with even moderately raised levels of homocysteine have a threefold increased risk of suffering heart attacks or strokes, it is not yet known whether reducing homocysteine levels will prevent cardiovascular problems. Nor is it known whether homocysteine itself is the culprit (although ample evidence suggests it is) or whether homocysteine is merely an indicator for something else that does the damage.</p>
        <p>Still, most researchers studying the matter say that it would be prudent not to wait until science reaches a verdict in two to five years. Their best advice is to spend the $80 or so on a blood test to determine your homocysteine level and, if it is higher than 9 micromoles per liter of plasma, change your diet to bring it down.</p>
        <p>Among those especially at risk of high homocysteine levels are people with chronic kidney failure, those with thyroid deficiencies, people who have received organ transplants and those living on high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets. Among those with other cardiovascular risk factors, including smoking, hypertension or high cholesterol, having even a moderately raised homocysteine level can significantly increase their risk.</p>
        <p>In an important way, our problems with cholesterol and homocysteine begin with diets rich in animal protein. For cholesterol, it is the saturated fat that is mainly derived from animal protein foods, along with dietary cholesterol that comes only from animal products, that raises blood levels of this artery-clogging substance. For homocysteine, animal protein itself is the indirect source. Homocysteine is an intermediate product derived from the metabolism of methionine, an essential amino acid predominant in animal protein.</p>
        <p>Three B vitamins -- folic acid (also called folate), B6 and B12 -- are involved in processing homocysteine to keep it from building up in the blood to levels that can cause harm. Of the three, folic acid is the most important. When folic acid is present in adequate amounts, homocysteine is converted back to methionine. Folic acid is found in significant amounts in green vegetables like asparagus, broccoli, spinach, cabbage and romaine lettuce, and in orange juice, lentils and wheat germ.</p>
        <p>But according to studies by Dr. Elias Seyoum and Dr. Jacob Selhub at the Jean Mayer Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University in Boston, two foods on the no-no list for cholesterol happen to be the best sources of folate that is readily available to the body: egg yolk and cow's liver. Eggs and liver are also important sources of vitamin B12, which aids in converting homocysteine back to methionine. Though low in fat, these two foods are among the richest sources of dietary cholesterol and thus have been all but eliminated from the diets of many people trying to keep their blood cholesterol levels low.</p>
        <p>Availability of folate is also influenced by how foods are prepared. Since B vitamins are soluble in water, when vegetables are cooked in water, much of the folic acid leaches out. Dr. Selhub recommends using the cooking water, for example, to prepare a soup or stew, to recapture the lost B vitamins. To better preserve B vitamins, vegetables can be steamed or cooked in a microwave oven with little or no water.</p>
        <p>Other good sources of folate are fortified grains (products like bread and pasta made with wheat flour) and cereals. In 1998, the Food and Drug Administration mandated the addition of folate to these inexpensive and commonly consumed foods to reduce the risk of the neural tube birth defects,  spina bifida and anencephaly. Folate fortification has had a side benefit of lowering homocysteine levels.</p>
        <p>But people living on the now-popular high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets are receiving a double whammy. In addition to consuming huge amounts of methionine-rich animal protein foods, they are likely to be sorely deficient in folate and at risk of developing dangerously high blood levels of homocysteine unless they take a daily vitamin supplement that contains at least 400 micrograms of folate.</p>
        <p>But for some people, this amount of folate is insufficient to reduce homocysteine to safe levels. For example, Dr. Selhub said,  people who have had kidney transplants need 2.4 milligrams of folate -- six times the amount in an ordinary supplement -- to lower homocysteine.</p>
        <p>With folate, people with high homocysteine levels are usually advised to take supplements of vitamins B6 and B12. Foods rich in B6 include broccoli, spinach, avocado, banana, oatmeal, wheat germ and chicken. B12 is found only in animal foods: liver and other meats, fish, eggs and milk.</p>
        <p>In a study in Germany among 150 women of childbearing age, those who took a 400-microgram folic acid supplement daily for four weeks experienced an 11 percent drop in homocysteine. But those who in addition to folic acid took 400 micrograms of B12 had an 18 percent drop in homocysteine, according to Dr. Anja Bronstrup and colleagues at the University of Bonn's Institute of Nutritional Science.</p>
        <p>Another way to reduce homocysteine may be to reduce stress. Even mild stress can temporarily raise homocysteine levels, a study by Dr. Catherine Stoney at Ohio State University showed. Lowering homocysteine could be one reason for the observed cardiovascular benefits of meditation.</p>
