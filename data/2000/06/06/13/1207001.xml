        <p>What's ''normal''? That's the question dozens of researchers and some physicians are now asking themselves about homocysteine, a substance in blood that may rival cholesterol as a major actor in the nation's leading killer, heart disease, and play an important role in other common health problems as well.</p>
        <p>Recent evidence has implicated elevated blood levels of homocysteine, an unhappy byproduct of normal metabolism, in conditions ranging from miscarriages and birth defects to  strokes, Alzheimer's disease and other disorders that afflict older people, including osteoporosis and presbyopia, the eye changes that force the middle-aged to acquire reading glasses.</p>
        <p>And since hostility and stress raise blood levels of homocysteine, it may explain why these emotional states are linked to heart attacks.</p>
        <p>Though strong hints of homocysteine's ability to damage arteries date back more than 30 years, until the 1990's its importance in cardiovascular disease was completely overshadowed by cholesterol. While concerns about elevated cholesterol levels fingered dietary fat as the culprit, high levels of homocysteine are associated with a diet rich in animal protein, the source of homocysteine's parent compound, the amino acid methionine.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, as Dr. Meir Stampfer of the Harvard School of Public Health pointed out, ''there was no commercial interest in studying homocysteine,'' since the way to reduce it -- eating less meat and taking supplements of B vitamins -- is inexpensive and not patentable. For cholesterol, on the other hand, pharmaceutical companies seeking to sell cholesterol-lowering drugs paid for many studies.</p>
        <p>In addition, homocysteine's potential role in common disorders may have been overlooked because the levels associated with an increased risk of health problems are still listed as normal by medical laboratories -- 8 to 20 micromoles per liter of blood plasma. However, recent studies have linked levels as low as 15 micromoles to an increased risk of heart attack, stroke, peripheral vascular disease and venous thromboembolism, potentially life-threatening blood clots in the veins.</p>
        <p>Among the 15,000 doctors participating in the Physicians' Health Study, those with a homocysteine level of 15 micromoles or higher had a heart attack rate three times as high as those with lower levels over a period of just five years, Dr. Stampfer and his Harvard colleagues found. Even a level of 12 micromoles can double coronary risk.</p>
        <p>Dr. William Castelli, former director of the Framingham Heart Study,  who now heads the Framingham Cardiovascular Institute in Massachusetts, considers levels higher than 9 micromoles to be elevated, placing people at increased risk of a heart attack or stroke. In the Framingham study, he said, about 40 percent of the people had homocysteine levels greater than 9.</p>
        <p>''Homocysteine is an important new risk factor for cardiovascular disease,'' Dr. Castelli said in an interview. ''There are about 17 studies now under way to determine the benefits of lowering homocysteine levels. We're still missing crucial data. We don't yet know if lowering homocysteine will result in a lower rate of heart attacks or strokes.'' The studies are being financed by the National Institutes of Health.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Castelli and others pointed out that since the way to bring down homocysteine -- eating less meat and taking supplements of the B vitamins folate, B6 and B12 that are required by the enzymes that process homocysteine -- is harmless and inexpensive, people should not have to wait five or more years for the research results before trying to lower their own homocysteine levels.</p>
        <p>There are several ways in which homocysteine can damage blood vessels. It injures the cells that line arteries and stimulates the growth of smooth muscle cells; both effects can result in lesions that narrow the channels through which blood flows. Homocysteine can also disrupt normal blood clotting mechanisms, increasing the risk of clots that can bring on a heart attack or stroke.</p>
        <p>Damage to the small blood vessels in the brain may explain the relationship that has been found between elevated homocysteine levels and the loss of cognitive function and Alzheimer's disease, say Dr. Jacob Selhub and colleagues at the United States Department of Agriculture Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University in Boston. Starting in 1983, they noted, several studies have linked an inadequate supply of B vitamins to a decline in cognitive function in the elderly, and some studies have shown that taking supplements of B vitamins improves cognitive performance.</p>
        <p>For example, this year in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, Dr. David A. Snowdon and colleagues at the University of Kentucky College of Medicine in Lexington described a study of 30 nuns who had lived in the same convent and eaten from the same kitchen until their deaths at ages 78 to 101. Blood samples taken years earlier revealed that those who had low blood levels of folate were far more likely to have suffered atrophy of the cerebral cortex. The lower the folate levels, the more severe the atrophy of the nuns' brains.</p>
        <p>As for other disorders common in the elderly, Dr. Carlos L. Krumdieck and Dr. Charles W. Prince, nutrition scientists at the University of Alabama Schools of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Related Professions in Birmingham, have described a link between moderately elevated homocysteine levels and the occurrence of senile osteoporosis and presbyopia. They pointed out that the contribution of chronically elevated homocysteine levels ''to diseases of old age may have gone unrecognized because we are conditioned to accept them as inescapable consequences of growing old.''</p>
        <p>The harmful effects of homocysteine on blood vessels and blood clotting may also explain the link between elevated levels of this amino acid and various pregnancy complications, including repeated early miscarriage; pre-eclampsia, or pregnancy-related hypertension; premature birth; very low birth weight; and certain birth defects.</p>
        <p>Researchers at the University Hospital Nijmegen St. Radboud in the Netherlands reported recently in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology that 123 women who had experienced repeated early miscarriages had ''significantly lower serum folate concentrations'' and higher levels of homocysteine than a comparison group of 101 women who had not had miscarriages.</p>
        <p>In another recent report in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, researchers in Bergen, Norway, found that among 5,883 women who had a total of 14,492 pregnancies, those with the highest levels of homocysteine were significantly more likely to have experienced pregnancy complications like pre-eclampsia, premature birth and very low birth weight than women with the lowest homocysteine levels.</p>
        <p>It has been known for some time that increasing a woman's intake of folate during the first three weeks of pregnancy can greatly decrease the risk of often lethal spinal deformities like spina bifida and anencephaly in the fetus. This prompted the Food and Drug Administration to order, as of January 1998, fortification of all flour and grain products with folate, a measure that Dr. Selhub said had  reduced elevated homocysteine levels in the general population by about 10 percent. Although a practicing physician reviewing a patient's laboratory test report may understandably dismiss a homocysteine level of, say, 12 micromoles as normal, a 1995 analysis of 27 studies indicated that there was no absolute safe blood level of this substance. Rather, as with cholesterol, the risk associated with homocysteine is on a continuum; an increase of only 5 micromoles in the plasma level of homocysteine can raise a person's chances of developing cardiovascular disease by as much as a 20-milligram rise in cholesterol would. Other reports have equated homocysteine's risk to the cardiovascular system with the damage done by smoking or a high blood level of cholesterol.</p>
        <p>In fact, the emerging appreciation of the risks associated with so-called normal levels of homocysteine parallels the experience with cholesterol. As recently as two decades ago, doctors regarded cholesterol levels in blood plasma of 240 milligrams as normal, but now levels above 200 milligrams are recognized as increasing a person's risk of developing cardiovascular disease. And, as with cholesterol, homocysteine levels tend to rise with age and are generally higher in men than in women, at least until women reach menopause.</p>
        <p>Homocysteine also appears to exacerbate the effects of other cardiovascular risks. For example, high homocysteine ''substantially increases the risk associated with smoking and hypertension,'' Dr. Iftikhar J. Kullo and colleagues at the Mayo Clinic pointed out. And among people with diabetes, a recent study from the Netherlands found that for each five-micromole rise in homocysteine, the risk of dying from any cause over a five-year period was more than triple that of nondiabetics with the same homocysteine levels.</p>
        <p>Homocysteine is an amino acid, an intermediate product that builds up when the amino acid methionine cannot be converted to cysteine because an enzyme is lacking or is present in inadequate amounts. The B vitamins folic acid, or folate, and B6 and B12 are crucial to these conversion enzymes. But it has not yet been demonstrated that taking vitamins to lower homocysteine will prevent heart disease or any other disorder linked to homocysteine.</p>
        <p>What is known so far is that vitamin therapy can slow and even reverse clogging of the carotid arteries that feed the brain, which should reduce the risk of stroke. Dr. Daniel G. Hackam and colleagues at the Siebens-Drake/Robarts Research Institute in London, Ontario, showed a reversal of carotid artery clogging in patients with homocysteine levels both above and below 14 micromoles who took 2.5 milligrams of folic acid,  25 milligrams of B6 and 250 micrograms of B12 daily for a year. They concluded that ''these observations support a causal relationship between homocysteine and atherosclerosis and, taken with epidemiological evidence, suggest that in patients with vascular disease, the level to treat may be less than 9 micromoles per liter.''</p>
        <p>The homocysteine story actually began in 1969 when Dr. Kilmer S. McCully reported that children born with a genetic error of metabolism that causes their homocysteine levels to skyrocket to hundreds of micromoles died with advanced disease in their arteries at a very young age.</p>
        <p>In the last two decades there were occasional reports of advanced clotting in arteries feeding the brains of children with homocystinuria, as the genetic condition is called. In other cases, seriously thickened walls of the carotid arteries were found in young adults born with only one of the two genes that cause homocystinuria.</p>
        <p>But, perhaps because in most people homocysteine levels rarely exceed 30 micromoles, until recently few researchers appreciated the significance of Dr. McCully's finding or any of the subsequent observations in people with homocysteine levels in the hundreds of micromoles.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Dr. McCully lost his research financing and his job at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School and was forced to do what little he could to pursue the homocysteine hypothesis on his own while working at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Providence, R.I.</p>
        <p>Dr. McCully, who is now enjoying renewed respect with the emergence of homocysteine as a cardiovascular risk factor, considers arteriosclerosis, a clogging of the arteries with fats and other substances, to be a disease of ''protein intoxication.'' While Americans are busy focusing on fat avoidance to lower cholesterol, he believes they should be reducing their consumption of animal protein to lower homocysteine.</p>
        <p>Indeed, a study recently published in Preventive Medicine by Dr. David J. DeRose of the Lifestyle Center of America in Sulphur, Okla., and colleagues showed that a diet devoid of animal products, caffeine and alcohol, along with exercise, stress management and spiritual support -- but no B vitamin supplements -- reduced homocysteine levels in 40 men and women by an average of 13 percent in just one week.</p>
        <p>''I'm thrilled that scientists all over the world are now taking up the question of homocysteine and heart disease,'' Dr. McCully said. ''An avalanche of studies has demonstrated the validity of this approach, and I anticipate that the studies now under way will prove that controlling homocysteine is the best way to deal with heart disease.''</p>
