        <p>A Cook's Tour In the Rain</p>
        <p>Hours before last night's tribute to the chef and food authority James Beard, who died in 1985, the high-ceilinged lobby at 30 Rockefeller Center smelled like barbecue. And no wonder: rainy weather had forced more than 20 chefs indoors.

        <p>A Cook's Tour In the Rain</p>
        <p>Hours before last night's tribute to the chef and food authority James Beard, who died in 1985, the high-ceilinged lobby at 30 Rockefeller Center smelled like barbecue. And no wonder: rainy weather had forced more than 20 chefs indoors. They were setting up long tables in subterranean corridors and figuring out logistics: the cooking was still being done outside, on grills under umbrellas, but the plates were being served inside.</p>
        <p>''The charcoal burns fine with a little water,'' said ED BROWN, a chef at the Sea Grill, also in Rockefeller Center.</p>
        <p>But the rain did not stop the chefs from reminiscing about Beard, a larger-than-life figure in the food world. ALFRED PORTALE of the Gotham Bar and Grill recalled meeting Beard 20 years ago.</p>
        <p>Mr. Portale had just graduated from the Culinary Institute of America and was working at Bloomingdale's when Beard walked in with JULIA CHILD; at 6 feet 2 inches, two giants. ''Toe to toe,'' Mr. Portale said, ''they stood head to head.''</p>
        <p>Quiz Question Gets a Reprise</p>
        <p>The question boiled down to, what instrument does YO-YO MA play?</p>
        <p>If it sounds familiar, no wonder: It was asked on two prime-time game shows that were broadcast last week -- ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' on ABC on Tuesday and ''It's Your Chance of a Lifetime'' on Fox on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>''This seems to be an unusual random circumstance,'' said a spokeswoman for ''Millionaire,'' who noted that the program had been taped 12 days before it was broadcast.</p>
        <p>Did ''Chance'' sneak someone into the audience at the ''Millionaire'' taping to copy the questions? Certainly not, said KIM FITZGERALD, a spokeswoman for Fox. ''I honestly think it was a coincidence,'' she said. ''You know those game-show writers. They're all pulling from the same pool of questions.''</p>
        <p>The pool of contestants was 1 for 1 on Mr. Ma. On ''Chance,'' the contestant, MIKI MOOTSEY, had three possible answers to choose from: piano, cello or violin. She picked violin. On ''Millionaire,'' TOM O'BRIEN had four choices: cello, piano, flute or guitar. He polled the audience, which said cello. So did he, but only he won the $32,000.</p>
        <p>For TV Actor, Honor in 'Death'</p>
        <p>The actor VINCENT PASTORE sounds relieved that the character he played on the HBO series ''The Sopranos'' was shot to death and dumped in the ocean in an episode in April. Getting whacked on camera has simplified his off-camera life.</p>
        <p>''There is a social club in Pelham Bay where I hang out from time to time,'' Mr. Pastore, who played the mobster-turned-informant Big Pussy on the show, said the other day. ''I can't mention the name of the place or give any names. The wise guys who run the club put my picture up on the wall when I started acting in 'The Sopranos.' They were real proud of me. Then when I started talking to the feds on the show, they were not too happy. I went in one day and my picture was off the wall. To that crew, it doesn't matter to them that I was only acting on TV. A rat is a rat is a rat.''</p>
        <p>Big Pussy's death has restored Mr. Pastore's reputation at the club. ''I've been forgiven,'' he said. ''At least, my picture is back up on the wall.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pastore's former boss -- the creator of ''The Sopranos,'' not one of the mob guys Mr. Pastore hangs out with -- will be at City Hall tomorrow with one of the show's big fans, MAYOR RUDOLPH W. GIULIANI. DAVID CHASE, who created the show and is its lead writer, is one of six producers and writers chosen for awards by the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting. Also in the group is DARREN STARR, the creator of ''Sex and the City'' on HBO.</p>
        <p>Other awards will go to REGIS PHILBIN, the host of ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' and ''Live With Regis and Kathie Lee,'' and GEORGE DETITTA, the president of Local 52 of studio mechanics. A spokesman for the mayor's film office said that the awards go to people involved in programs that generate jobs for the city.</p>
