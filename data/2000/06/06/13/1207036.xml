        <p>With major record labels cutting back on classical music releases, 66 of the most prestigious American symphony orchestras and opera and ballet companies have reached an agreement with the musicians union that allows them to turn to the Internet as a prime distribution vehicle for their work.</p>
        <p>The landmark agreement, reached after a year of discussions between the American Federation of Musicians and representatives from such important organizations as the New York Philharmonic, the Cleveland Orchestra and the Metropolitan Opera, will govern compensation to be paid to musicians for performances made available on the Internet. These performances would potentially include live concerts available through what is known as ''streaming audio'' -- that is live audio that cannot be stored by listeners -- -- as well as recordings that can be downloaded for a fee. The agreement permits the music to be downloaded either from the orchestras' own Web sites, or from the Web sites of companies that would license recordings.</p>

        <p>With major record labels cutting back on classical music releases, 66 of the most prestigious American symphony orchestras and opera and ballet companies have reached an agreement with the musicians union that allows them to turn to the Internet as a prime distribution vehicle for their work.</p>
        <p>The landmark agreement, reached after a year of discussions between the American Federation of Musicians and representatives from such important organizations as the New York Philharmonic, the Cleveland Orchestra and the Metropolitan Opera, will govern compensation to be paid to musicians for performances made available on the Internet. These performances would potentially include live concerts available through what is known as ''streaming audio'' -- that is live audio that cannot be stored by listeners -- -- as well as recordings that can be downloaded for a fee. The agreement permits the music to be downloaded either from the orchestras' own Web sites, or from the Web sites of companies that would license recordings.</p>
        <p>At least at first, some of the negotiators believe, live performances would be available free as streaming audio, with sites hoping to generate income through advertising. But until high speed Internet access becomes more widely available, downloading will be daunting for most people -- using today's typical modems and conventional phone lines, it can take a full day to retrieve an opera.</p>
        <p>The agreement would give musicians both payments for music made available on the Internet, ranging from small advances to more expansive royalty payments, and a measure of control over  which performances are marketed.</p>
        <p>If it is ratified by both musicians and orchestra managements over the next few weeks, it will be retroactive to last February and will run through Jan. 31, 2002.</p>
        <p>Over the next few years, the agreement may serve to dramatically alter the way many, if not most, classical music fans obtain contemporary recordings, and may help orchestras replace income they used to count on from record sales. As labels have lost interest in low-volume classical sales which generate more prestige than income, many American orchestras have been dropped by labels that have recorded them for decades. A classical recording, if it sells 20,000 copies is regarded as a hit; a pop hit more typically sells hundreds of thousands or millions of copies.</p>
        <p>Currently, of the traditional top-five American orchestras, only the Philharmonic and the Chicago Symphony have recording deals; the Cleveland Orchestra, the Boston Symphony and the Philadelphia Orchestra, whose older recordings with such conductors as Sir Georg Solti, Fritz Reiner, Pierre Monteux and Eugene Ormandy are staples of the classical catalog, do not.</p>
        <p>The negotiations were conducted by a group of managers and musicians who called themselves the Electronic Media Forum. Among them were player and management representatives from the Philharmonic; the Met; the New York City Ballet; the Philadelphia and Cleveland Orchestras; the San Francisco, St. Louis, National, and Milwaukee Symphonies; and the Pittsburgh and Houston Grand Operas.</p>
        <p>Copies of the memorandum of agreement were sent to the orchestras and musicians over the weekend, together with an introductory letter that includes a set of starkly worded ''shared fundamental beliefs about our industry'' that led to the discussions. The first of these is that ''the recording industry no longer has any significant interest in the creation and effective marketing of new recordings of our orchestras.'' Representatives of several classical music labels did not return calls for comment.</p>
        <p>For orchestra managers, the situation is exacerbated by the proliferation of ''electronic media guarantees'' in musicians' contracts, which guarantee minimum annual payments for recordings and radio and television performances even if those engagements don't take place.</p>
        <p>Lately, managers have been eyeing the world of e-commerce hungrily. Although there is no reliable market research on the demand for classical music on the Web, several orchestras, including the Cleveland and the National Symphony, have been working with Internet companies to develop ways to sell their performances on line. So far, however, orchestras have faced contractual and technological hurdles.</p>
        <p>The contractual hurdle, which will fall if the new agreement is ratified this summer, concerns what kinds of performances could be offered on the Internet, and what the musicians would be paid.</p>
        <p>The tentative contract covers two kinds of production, streaming audio and music for downloading. ''My personal belief is that the culture of the Internet is based on the premise that content is free,'' said Joseph Kluger, the president of the Philadelphia Orchestra and the chairman of the Managers' Media Committee during the negotiations. ''And I think that at first, most orchestras will end up offering their music for streaming, free to the consumer.'' He said the sites could attract advertising. The eventual goal, however, is to make the equivalents of recordings specifically to be marketed on the World Wide Web. Here the agreement poses some limitations: because it covers only the distribution of music in digital form on the Internet, the agreement precludes the manufacture of compact discs.</p>
        <p>But orchestras could produce something very much like a CD. The agreement gives them the right to use audio (but not video) recorded at both concerts and rehearsals. Just as most commercial recordings of orchestral music are edited together from multiple takes, an orchestra could create idealized performances by editing together segments of several concerts and rehearsals. Consumers could download these recordings for a fee that Mr. Kluger described as ''probably significantly lower than they'd be paying for a CD at Tower Records.''</p>
        <p>This is where the technological hurdle comes in. Until high-speed Internet access is more widely available, downloading a grandly scaled Romantic symphony, let alone an opera, is a daunting prospect. Using a 56K modem, which is standard on most computers on a conventional telephone line, it can take upwards of eight hours to download an hour of music encoded as MP3 files. At that rate it would take a full day to download an opera, and more than five days to download the Wagner ''Ring'' cycle.</p>
        <p>''That's why we think that for the moment, the practical application of this agreement will be in streaming audio,'' said Florence Nelson, director of the Symphonic Service Division at the American Federation of Musicians. ''But we wanted to be in front of this technology, rather than trying to catch up with it later.''</p>
        <p>The agreement promises musicians a variety of options for compensation, tied to a complex set of scenarios involving such questions as who retains control of the recordings, how long the recordings are licensed for, and whether a licensing agreement involves royalty payments for the players.</p>
        <p>Each of these variables would be negotiated separately. But in several scenarios including one where the musicians receive no royalties, each player would be entitled to an advance payment of six percent of weekly scale. For musicians in the Florida Orchestra in Tampa, whose members have an annual minimum salary of $26,550, that would come to $30.63. For members of the New York Philharmonic, whose minimum annual salary is $88,920, the payment would be $102.60.</p>
        <p>The agreement also gives the musicians and management equal clout in deciding which Internet projects will be undertaken through what the agreement calls ''local Internet oversight committees.'' Although they can have several management and player representatives, each side would have only a single vote. In effect, a project could not be undertaken without a unanimous vote.</p>
        <p>The ensembles whose Internet recordings would be covered by the new agreement cover the full spectrum of American orchestras, from those with comparatively small budgets like the Alabama, Des Moines and New Mexico Symphony Orchestras, to virtually all of this country's bigger organizations. Among the other orchestras covered in the agreement are the orchestras of Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Cincinnati, Dallas, Detroit, Grand Rapids, Kansas City, Louisville, Los Angeles, Oklahoma City, Phoenix, Pittsburgh and Portland.</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 15, 2000, Thursday  An article on Tuesday about an agreement with the musicians' union permitting the distribution of classical music over the Internet referred incorrectly to orchestral recordings conducted by Sir Georg Solti and Fritz Reiner. Both were most closely associated with the Chicago Symphony; neither recorded with the Boston, Cleveland or Philadelphia Orchestra.</p>
