        <p>After months of promising a campaign finance reform package, the New York State Senate's majority leader, Joseph Bruno, yesterday announced what serves as a modest step toward revamping one of the nation's worst state campaign funding systems. Mr. Bruno's bill, which is limited primarily to disclosure of contributions and enforcement against violations, still needs approval by his own house. Then the three alternative reform bills -- Mr. Bruno's, the Assembly's and Gov. George Pataki's -- would have to be woven into one package. But Mr. Bruno's starter bill is an important acknowledgment on his part that New York's fund-raising system is indeed broken and needs to be fixed.</p>
        <p>The Bruno proposal does well to expand and expedite disclosure requirements, setting up one central databank to include even contributions to local campaigns. The bill would also require more detailed reporting, including listing phone bank operations as contributions and identifying ''bundlers'' who deliver multiple contributions. It attempts to give more clout to the Board of Elections by increasing penalties and expanding enforcement -- another good push in the right direction.</p>

        <p>After months of promising a campaign finance reform package, the New York State Senate's majority leader, Joseph Bruno, yesterday announced what serves as a modest step toward revamping one of the nation's worst state campaign funding systems. Mr. Bruno's bill, which is limited primarily to disclosure of contributions and enforcement against violations, still needs approval by his own house. Then the three alternative reform bills -- Mr. Bruno's, the Assembly's and Gov. George Pataki's -- would have to be woven into one package. But Mr. Bruno's starter bill is an important acknowledgment on his part that New York's fund-raising system is indeed broken and needs to be fixed.</p>
        <p>The Bruno proposal does well to expand and expedite disclosure requirements, setting up one central databank to include even contributions to local campaigns. The bill would also require more detailed reporting, including listing phone bank operations as contributions and identifying ''bundlers'' who deliver multiple contributions. It attempts to give more clout to the Board of Elections by increasing penalties and expanding enforcement -- another good push in the right direction.</p>
        <p>Still, the proposal would place only a $76,500 limit per contributor on ''soft money'' instead of banning these party slush funds altogether. The effort also fails to lower the state's overly generous campaign contribution limits, just as it misses a provision for public financing that opens the electoral process to candidates without their own money or backing by special interests.</p>
        <p>Governor Pataki's version of reform was also introduced at the end of last year's session, and went nowhere. Perhaps Mr. Bruno can earn credit not merely for introducing his plan but for negotiating real reform in Albany beyond the usual press announcement.</p>
