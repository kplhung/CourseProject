        <p>A 20-year-old woman was killed and four other pedestrians were injured when a car was hit by another car and jumped the sidewalk of a busy street in Brooklyn yesterday, plowing into a crowd, the police said.</p>
        <p>The accident, on Atlantic Avenue near Thomas S. Boyland Street in the Brownsville section, occurred around 5:30 p.m. as commuters emerging from the subway waited to cross the street, witnesses said.</p>
        <p>''It was just awful,'' said Sandra Dyer, who lives nearby and heard the collision.</p>
        <p>Details of how the accident happened were slow to emerge and no charges were immediately filed against the drivers, said Sgt. Elias Nikas, a police spokesman.</p>
        <p>The woman was dead on arrival at Brookdale Hospital Medical Center and a 20-year-old man was in critical condition last night. The other victims were another 20-year-old woman, who was at Brookdale, and a 24-year-old woman and a man, both of whom were being treated at Kings County Hospital, the police said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Dyer said that the intersection, like many along wide, crowded Atlantic Avenue, was dangerous. Last week, Ms. Dyer said, she saw an elderly woman hit by a car while trying to cross Boyland.</p>
        <p>The local City Council member, Tracy Boyland, said that after last week's accident, she asked the City Department of Transportation to add a left-turn arrow to the traffic light on Atlantic Avenue for eastbound cars turning onto Boyland. The project is proceeding, she said.</p>
