        <p>Filip Defoort adjusted the equipment on the table beside him -- a slide projector, a digital camera and a tripod -- altogether worth perhaps a few hundred dollars at your local office store.</p>
        <p>About six feet away, a man posed quietly on an office chair set against a white backdrop. Mr. Defoort flicked a switch, and the slide projector suddenly bathed the man in a white glare, projecting onto his face a barely perceptible network of meshlike lines about as fine as mosquito-netting. In about 90 seconds, after a bit more fiddling, Mr. Defoort will have on his screen a three-dimensional rendering of the man's face, the building block for cheaper and faster computer animation.</p>
        <p>''The amazing thing is that it's so simple, really,'' said Christopher Cain, 56, a veteran movie director turned president of the new Moon Crescent Studios, now hard at work on its first animated feature. ''With this new technology we will be able to make an animated film at well under half the cost of a normal animated film and in a fraction of the time, about a year from the start of production to the finish. We believe this really leaps past what anybody else out there is doing.''</p>
        <p>Computer animation and computer-generated effects have become increasingly central to the business of making movies, as this year's crop of summer films makes clear, from the digital Coliseum in ''Gladiator'' to the digital waves in ''The Perfect Storm'' to the digital creatures in ''Dinosaur.'' Indeed, the only hurdles that have slowed the further proliferation of computers into Hollywood have been the high costs and time-consuming nature of the process.</p>
        <p>Moon Crescent's groundbreaking process is part of a larger trend that is gradually changing the computer graphics landscape, making it cheaper and faster to create convincing and engaging computer animation and effects. Movie production companies, from the largest studios to the smallest independents, are noting a recent surge in the number of new companies -- sometimes with as few as one or two people working out of an apartment -- offering good-quality high-resolution computer graphics.</p>
        <p>Distinct from the more traditional, pencil-and-paper animation of Mickey Mouse and ''Bambi'' or the stop-motion animation in which actual figurines are moved in tiny increments, as in ''King Kong'' and ''Gumby,'' the computer-generated animation of a ''Toy Story'' or ''Antz'' involves building a character and an environment from the inside out. Animators build their creations out of computer code, create digital skeletons and then overlay textures upon the skeletons while creating virtual light sources to produce a three-dimensional world. Computer animators working at their screens then move their virtual characters and digital objects in tiny increments to create the illusion of life.</p>
        <p>By contrast, motion capture -- which has been more commonly used in advanced computer games than in feature films -- begins with making a movie of real people or animals moving through real space and then superimposing that movement onto computer-generated characters, saving much time and effort. Common motion capture involves sticking data points that look like Ping-Pong balls onto parts of an actor's body and then charting the movement of those data points as the actor moves through a crisscrossing grid of laser lights.</p>
        <p>Instead of making an animated character run or jump, the filmmakers can simply film a real person running and jumping and then superimpose that movement onto the animated character. This new process uses white light -- that is, regular light bulbs instead of lasers -- and projects a grid over the actor's face and body, rather than having an actor move through a three-dimensional grid of laser beams.</p>
        <p>''I think we are sitting at an exciting point, where the costs are about to come down at an incredibly rapid rate,'' said Chris Meledandri, president of 20th Century Fox Animation. ''We're just beginning to see the development of a lot of inexpensive animation software, some of it being put together by young guys working out of their garage. We are going to see more and more people using some of this new technology instead of doing things with a traditional studio.''</p>
        <p>Habib Zargarpour, associate visual effects supervisor at Industrial Light and Magic, the computer effects house created by George Lucas, said that this was a development that he and other computer graphic specialists have seen coming for a while. And the arrival of over-the-counter computer graphic software like Maya and Houdini in recent years makes it possible for newcomers to create their own plug-ins and churn out high-quality computer images quickly.</p>
        <p>''About seven years ago, I remember talking to someone about how worrying this was, and I'll never forget what he said to me,'' Mr. Zargarpour said. ''He said, 'Well, everybody has a pencil, but not everybody can do Disney movies.' And I think that's really it. More people will be able to do these kinds of effects, but that doesn't mean they'll do good ones.''</p>
        <p>Continuing his demonstration, Mr. Defoort, a 27-year-old from Belgium, adjusted the focus on the mesh shadow that covered the man's face, then snapped a digital photograph. In a few moments, the photo appeared in Mr. Defoort's computer screen with the mesh lines only faintly visible. Using new software that he helped develop called Shape Snatcher, Mr. Defoort superimposed a digital mesh grid on the photograph and distorted it so that it matched the mesh lines that had been projected onto it. Then, in about a minute, the two-dimensional digital photograph transformed itself into a three-dimensional mask that was eerily lifelike and could be rotated for side, top  and bottom views.</p>
        <p>''We can do the same thing with a movie in about the same amount of time,'' said Mr. Defoort, whose company, EyeTronics, was acquired by Mr. Cain's fledgling studio. ''And since this is a white light process, not using lasers, we can also get the exact textures of whatever we're shooting, whether it's skin or wood or clay.''</p>
        <p>Moon Crescent will unveil this new process in its first feature -- a combination of live-action and three-dimensional animation called ''PC and the Web,'' about a young boy, played by Jeffrey Schoeny, 10, who is sucked into a computer and must follow the Information Highway to escape. The idea of using motion capture in computer animation is regarded as a bit like cheating by many computer animators, who take the more painstaking approach of creating and animating each character and adding the nuances of a performance bit by bit. The point of animated films, they argue, is to create an alternative world; if the filmmaker wants an approximation of the real world, they say, he should shoot live actors and be done with it.</p>
        <p>''Ever since the beginning of movies, people have always strived to get believable animation as cheaply and quickly as they could,'' said John Lasseter, creative director at Pixar Animation, creators of ''Toy Story'' and other computer-animated movies, and a leader in the field. ''But it's really hard to do.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lasseter voiced doubts about motion capture because the precise, humanlike movements that it creates often appear out of place in the fantasy world of animation. ''I always feel that the motion that feels most real for this kind of made-up environment needs to be caricatured, as well,'' he said. But Mr. Cain, who agreed with Mr. Lasseter that animation should look like animation, said he believed that the new software used by Moon Crescent would go motion capture one better and create a look and feel that was entirely distinct.</p>
        <p>Here's how it will work:</p>
        <p>Actors bathed by several of Mr. Defoort's mesh grids give their performance on a motion capture stage, which takes images of the performance from a full circle of cameras. These live action scenes will be transformed with the Shape Snatcher software into a three-dimensional computer image that can be viewed from any angle at the click of a button. At this point, the number of mesh lines on the faces of the actors can be decreased, from several thousand to several dozen, making the grid weave overlaying the actor's face look less like mosquito netting and more like a fishing net. Several crucial intersections on this new simplified grid, like the corners of mouths, cheekbones and eyes, will be pinpointed.</p>
        <p>While all this is going on, computer animators can create their characters in the traditional way on their computer screens. The main points from the simplified grid over an actor's face can then be overlaid on the face of the animated character so it can take on the life of the actor's performance.  One eerie effect, Mr. Cain said, is the sense of the live actor's personality and idiosyncrasies coming through the animated character.</p>
        <p>The company is only just beginning to realize how it may be able to cut costs further, Mr. Cain said. Already, he said, Moon Crescent will be able to make feature-length animated films for $40 million to $45 million compared with an average of $90 million for most recent animated features.</p>
        <p>Moon Crescent Studios is among the startup companies that are part of New Media Venture Partners, a Salt Lake City-based Internet incubator. Mr. Cain, the director of live action films like ''The Stone Boy'' (1984), ''Young Guns'' (1988) and ''The Amazing Panda Adventure'' (1995), said he had gotten involved with the venture after tiring of being a director for hire and deciding he would work only on films that truly interested him. The technological breakthrough came when Mr. Defoort joined a line of young Internet entrepreneurs to pitch their products to the new studio.</p>
        <p>''He showed us how he could use his software to make a 3-D computer image of a cup in about a minute,'' Mr. Cain said. ''We said, 'Oh, if only you could do that with live-action footage of an actor,' and he thought about it for a minute and said, 'Sure, he could do that.' So we said, 'O.K., do it.' And he came back the next day with about $300 worth of equipment and he did it.''</p>
        <p>On the strength of this new animation technique, New Media Ventures attracted $17 million worth of investment from Hewlett-Packard, much of it in the form of the dozens of computers and the motion capture equipment that the studio needed. Over the next three months Moon Crescent will move out of its cramped offices overlooking a public golf course in Manhattan Beach and into a new 52,000-square-foot studio being built about 10 blocks to the north, in the beach town El Segundo. Then the final stages of work on ''PC and the Web'' will commence in earnest.</p>
        <p>Talks with a major studio on distributing the finished film, which is expected to be ready by late next summer, are nearly complete, said Suzanne Gottlieb, the studio's executive vice president. After that Moon Crescent is planning to move into a regular rhythm of three movies a year: two live-action and one animated.</p>
        <p>Matt Ferro, the studio's visual effects and animation supervisor who worked on the special effects in ''The Matrix,'' said that the secrecy that has surrounded the new process until now had been particularly frustrating for him and the other special-effects veterans. ''It was maddening, because I knew that what we had was so great, but I couldn't say anything,'' he said. ''Now, at last, I'm glad that I can finally start telling people what I've been up to down here all this time. This is the coolest technology I've ever seen.''</p>
