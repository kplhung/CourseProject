        <p>FLUDD  By Hilary Mantel  181 pages. Henry Holt. $13.</p>
        <p>Wryly skewed descriptions of two Renaissance paintings bracket Hilary Mantel's darkly comic novel ''Fludd.'' Sebastiano del Piombo depicts Lazarus resurrected from the dead, his shroud wrapped towel-like around his head. He looks like a boxer in his corner, Ms. Mantel writes. ''One feels his troubles are about to begin again . . . so many rounds down, five to go.''</p>
        <p>As for Ambrosio Bergognone's Virgin and Child: though Mary looks sad, ''it is only on closer observation that one notices the near-smirk on her dimpled mouth.''</p>
        <p>A spoof of reverent intentions, it seems; and certainly that is a large part of this glum and wacky tale about the havoc worked upon a Roman Catholic parish in the Lancashire moors by a mysterious young priest (or is he?) sent to assist its aging pastor.</p>
        <p>''Fludd'' could be first cousin to Duchamp's portrait of the Mona Lisa wearing a mustache. Spoofs, though, get their edge from the seriousness of what is spoofed. Leonardo empowered Duchamp. Ms. Mantel's satire of a pinched religious community and its crabbed faith is not altogether removed from the darkness, penitential and tormented respectively, of the French writers Francois Mauriac and Georges Bernanos.</p>
        <p>But this is too serious. For the satire, think of the anti-clerical comedies of Anatole France; Ms. Mantel, whose best work may be a shrewd and expansive novel about Danton, has a grounding in French letters. Yet she could not be more English: think Fay Weldon, for her satire's mix of human and supernatural slapstick.</p>
        <p>''Fludd'' begins with a scabrous description of Featherhoughton, a 1950's factory town of cold-water taps, shared backyard privies, mean brick facades and meaner neighbors. The housewives scrub their black front stoops until they are black, then stand around in fake-fur slippers ''matted together with chip fat'' and exchange uncharitable remarks about the passers-by. At the rectory Miss Dempsey, the housekeeper, takes a phone call and shouts upstairs: ''Father Angwin get yourself up and dressed, the bishop will be upon us before 11 o'clock.''</p>
        <p>''Upon us,'' indeed. Father Angwin, learned, bitter and whiskey-sodden of a morning, despises ''His Corpulence'' and his morning-bright modernizing schemes. Angwin lost his faith 20 years ago and keeps himself going by strict orthodoxy. What's the use of a vernacular Mass, he complains, in view of his brutish flock's ''little grasp of English''?</p>
        <p>For Ms. Mantel, Angwin's lost faith is truer than the bishop's glib opportunism in lieu of faith. She sets up a wonderfully pointed dialogue between the two men. The bishop insists that Angwin accept what he calls his ''tips and hints.'' ''I don't see why I should when you are such an old fool,'' Angwin mutters in a far from inaudible ground bass, while piping an insincere obbligato, ''Consider me at your disposal.''</p>
        <p>Get rid of the dozens of saints' statues that clog your church, the bishop commands. Without the saints the parishioners won't come, Angwin protests. ''We are not here for fripperies,'' the bishop thunders. ''We are here for Christian virtues.''  ''Rubbish'' growls Angwin. ''These people aren't Christians. These people are heathens and Catholics.'' He submits, but in a shatteringly grotesque fashion. His parishioners dig holes, drag the statues out with ropes and pulleys and bury them.</p>
        <p>This is surreal comedy; it is also the terminal dark night of a dismal community's soul. Rescue arrives, peculiar and unfathomable.</p>
        <p>In rain-lashed, Bronte-ish darkness a cloaked figure descends the moors to the rectory door. ''Fludd,'' he introduces himself: both Miss Dempsey and Angwin take him for the curate the Bishop had threatened to send. Initial hostility melts quickly, though. Angwin and Fludd stay up until dawn talking theology -- not a crumb of modernity the whole time -- and drinking whiskey from a bottle that, in Fludd's hands, is mysteriously inexhaustible. The room stays warm from a self-replenishing coal fire.</p>
        <p>Fludd wanders about the surly parish bringing its low-grade fevers to a boil. Sister Philomena, a lusty Irish girl railroaded by her mother into the local convent, where she is under the bony thumb of the fierce Mother Perpetua, finds herself confiding in the new arrival. Soon she turns up in Angwin's confessional to ask absolution not for sins committed but for those she may soon commit.</p>
        <p>Angwin refuses with unprecedented mildness: with his statues as well as his faith gone, he is in a spiritual funk. So is the loyal Miss Dempsey. So is Philomena, beginning to stir but without visible hope of deliverance. And so, curiously for an agent of change -- no priest, it seems, but an angel of uncertain affiliation and instruction -- is Fludd.</p>
        <p>Instructions come, but they are peculiar, summed up by the command ''Action.'' Among the consequences: the statues dug up and restored (what's a church without mysteries, even if outdated?); the bishop routed; Angwin invigorated; the vanishing of a wen from Miss Dempsey's face; its relocation on Mother Perpetua's; helpful appearances by the Devil in the rosy, sulphur-smelling person of the local pharmacist; Philomena's and Fludd's elopement, their blissful honeymoon and his subsequent disappearance, leaving behind a satisfying wad of cash. (Only to Protestants, Philomena tells herself, is money the root of all evil).</p>
        <p>Much of this is fetching; some is far-fetched even in the terms of a fantasy-fable. The strength of ''Fludd'' is in its extremity -- there is a splendid two-page account of Philomena assembling the many layers of her habit before sneaking out at night to help dig up the statues -- and in the sallies, acid or loony, of its characters. The weakness is a certain random disorder in managing its theme or even, perhaps, deciding what it is. Ambiguity requires precision.</p>
        <p>Beneath Ms. Mantel's comedy there is a clenched painfulness. Her palette -- here and in several other novels -- is black, gray and mud-colored. The glittering highlights denote not warmth, love or hope but the exhilaration of unsparing perception. So oppressive is her universe that when truth makes someone free, it does so to a jarring laughter that should not be mistaken for happiness. Ms. Mantel's bitter cups of tea will not suit everyone, but they offer a biting refreshment.</p>
