        <p>Investigators at Los Alamos National Laboratory have discovered that computer hard drives containing nuclear weapons data and other highly sensitive material stored in a vault at the laboratory have disappeared, government officials said today.</p>
        <p>The hard drives were stored inside a vault in locked containers in the X Division of the national laboratory, where nuclear weapons are designed. They were reported missing on May 31 by officials who were inspecting the facilities after the forest fire in the Los Alamos, N.M., area, Energy Department officials said. While the containers were still in the vault, the hard drives were gone.</p>
        <p>The hard drives contained what officials described as data used by the government's Nuclear Emergency Search Team, or NEST, a unit that responds to nuclear accidents and nuclear-related threats from terrorists. The data on the hard drives includes all the information on American nuclear weapons that the team needs to render the nuclear devices safe in emergencies, officials said. Among the missing material was intelligence information concerning the Russian nuclear weapons program, law enforcement officials said.</p>
        <p>Officials are uncertain whether the data has been misplaced or stolen. It was also unclear whether the loss of the data would have any effect on the NEST team's ability to do its job.</p>
        <p>The Energy Department's new head of security, Eugene E. Habiger, has conducted a search at Los Alamos but did not find the data, officials said. He has written a secret report on the matter, and the F.B.I. has been brought in to conduct a joint investigation.</p>
        <p>''This is an extremely serious matter and we are taking swift actions to deal with it,'' John C. Browne, director of the laboratory, said in a statement. ''If the inquiry reveals that individuals did not fulfill their responsibilities with respect to this matter they will face certain and appropriate disciplinary actions.''</p>
        <p>Other officials stressed that it was premature to determine exactly what happened at Los Alamos. They said disruptions at the laboratory caused by last month's forest fire had impeded their investigation.</p>
        <p>Edward Curran, the director of the Energy Department's office of counterintelligence, said in a statement today that ''at this point there is no evidence that suggests espionage is involved in this incident.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Habiger, the director of the Energy Department's office of security and emergency operations, added that ''our inquiry has been conducted during a period in which employees are still recovering from the effects of a major emergency disaster, the fire.''</p>
        <p>An F.B.I. spokesman, John Collingwood, added that the investigation was a ''fully cooperative one'' between the F.B.I. and the Energy Department and was ''being conducted very aggressively.''</p>
        <p>Still, the disappearance of the nuclear weapons data represents a major embarrassment for a laboratory that has spent the last year under scrutiny for security lapses in connection with the Wen Ho Lee case. Dr. Lee was a scientist at Los Alamos who was fired in March 1999,  after being the subject of an investigation in connection with evidence that China may have stolen American nuclear secrets.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lee was never charged with espionage, but after he was dismissed investigators discovered that he had downloaded and copied vast amounts of classified nuclear weapons data from a secure computer at Los Alamos into an unclassified computer network and onto portable tapes. Dr. Lee was arrested last December on charges of mishandling classified material and is now in jail awaiting trial. He has said he is innocent of the charges.</p>
        <p>The discovery of the unauthorized downloads prompted Energy Secretary Bill Richardson to order a shutdown of the laboratory's computer systems, while mandating security training sessions for employees. Congress later passed legislation creating a nuclear weapons agency within the Energy Department to oversee Los Alamos and the nation's other nuclear weapons laboratories.</p>
        <p>Gen. John A. Gordon of the Air Force, who has been serving as the deputy director of central intelligence, has been nominated to head the new agency, the National Nuclear Security Administration.</p>
        <p>Energy Department and Los Alamos officials said the latest incident occurred long after Dr. Lee was dismissed and added that there was no evidence of any connection between the missing hard drives and Dr. Lee's case.</p>
        <p>Congressional leaders reacted sharply today to the news of another security lapse at the laboratory.</p>
        <p>''While we don't know whether the hard drives are lost, it gravely concerns me that they have even been displaced,'' said Senator Frank H. Murkowski, the Republican chairman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, which conducted hearings on laboratory security last year.</p>
        <p>Los Alamos officials recognized the potential political damage the new incident could cause.</p>
        <p>''I'm clearly very disappointed and dismayed that this happened,'' Dr. Browne said in an interview. ''To have this happen after all that we have done to improve security, and after the fire, is a real blow to the institution, and we need to find a way to get everybody back together and recover from it.''</p>
        <p>There was disagreement within the government today over how quickly laboratory officials had notified the Energy Department and the F.B.I. about the disappearance of the hard drives. Energy Department officials said they notified the F.B.I. as soon as they discovered that the material was missing.</p>
        <p>But some law enforcement officials said it was possible that some officials at the lab were aware that the data was missing long before informing Washington. Dr. Browne said today that the timing of when  people within the laboratory were first aware of the disappearance of the data was now under investigation. ''We're still trying to determine the time lines, but I can't go into that at this point,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Browne said that as soon as he found out, on the night of May 31, a major effort was started at the laboratory to find the missing material. A 72-hour search turned up nothing, however, and Energy Department teams came in to take over. ''We turned the lab upside down for three days,'' Dr. Browne said.</p>
        <p>The laboratory had already conducted 200 interviews with employees, he said. Other Energy officials said investigators would ask some employees to to take polygraph exams this week in connection with the disappearance.</p>
        <p>Dr. Browne added that late today he ordered a shutdown of organizations within Los Alamos that handle similar types of classified information or similar materials, to double check their security procedures.</p>
        <p>''I want to make sure we understand lab practices across the board,'' he said. ''I don't think we have a broader problem, but given what we have been through, we have got to do this.''</p>
        <p>The laboratory director said he agreed with Mr. Curran that there was no evidence of espionage. Rather, he said, it appeared to be human error, possibly related to the chaotic events surrounding the fire, which was started on May 4 and burned for about three weeks, destroying 48,000 acres and hundreds of homes. The fire came within one-half mile of the building where the data was stored.</p>
        <p>''This could still be a situation where the hard drives could be misplaced or lost in the labs,'' another official said. ''In my opinion it is premature to call this a security breach.''</p>
        <p>But the fact that the missing data included intelligence information increased the level of concern among law enforcement officials.</p>
        <p>The incident at Los Alamos is just the latest in a series of security problems that have plagued the government recently. This spring, the State Department acknowledged that a laptop computer packed with classified information had disappeared from the department's headquarters.</p>
        <p>Separately, the Justice Department has started a criminal investigation into evidence that John M. Deutch, former Central Intelligence director, placed classified information on unclassified computers in his home, potential violations of both C.I.A. regulations and federal law.</p>
