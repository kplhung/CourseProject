        <p>The World Health Organization, taking its first comprehensive look at drug-resistant diseases, concluded in a report released today that the effectiveness of antibiotics had been so eroded globally that some diseases that were once easily treatable are now often incurable.</p>
        <p>Misuse of antibiotics, including overprescribing, and their use to increase animal growth have made treating illnesses as diverse as ear infections, tuberculosis and malaria much more difficult, said the report from the health agency, part of the United Nations.</p>
        <p>The report, casting a wide net, said that many treatments once effective for illnesses, including viral ones, were being undermined through misuse. And it said that drug research and marketing systems made needed drugs unavailable to poor countries, contributing to the problems.</p>
        <p>The 65-page report, ''Overcoming Antimicrobial Resistance,'' describes how the major infectious diseases are gradually becoming impervious to existing drugs, reducing the curative power of ''once life-saving medicines to that of a sugar pill.''</p>
        <p>One of the ''major health care disasters of the 20th century'' is the abuse of antibiotics to the extent that it has propelled gonorrhea, ''a once-curable nuisance, into a potentially life-threatening contagion,'' the study said. In much of Southeast Asia, penicillin is no longer effective against an estimated 98 percent of gonorrhea strains, and untreated gonorrhea helps spread the virus that causes AIDS.</p>
        <p>''It took 20 years to develop penicillin for medical use, and then 20 years for this drug to become virtually useless for treating gonorrhea in most parts of the world,'' said Dr. David Heymann, chief of the agency's program on communicable diseases.</p>
        <p>Speaking more broadly, he said, ''If we had not eradicated smallpox in 1980, we probably couldn't today.''  He added that the spread of H.I.V. and the lowered immunity it causes would undercut the effectiveness of the smallpox vaccine.</p>
        <p>The World Health Organization is urging a global effort to make vaccinations more widespread to avoid infection, to educate health workers and the public on using medicine wisely, to reduce use of drugs for animal growth and to help poor countries get needed antibiotics.</p>
        <p>Efforts to combat the world's biggest killer, pneumonia -- which killed 3.5 million people in 1998 -- are being undermined, the report said, because 80 percent of respiratory infections are treated with unnecessary medications. That has resulted in more frequent failures of standard antibiotic treatment for chest infections. In South Korea, 70 percent of those infections were resistant to penicillin, the agency said.</p>
        <p>Drug resistance has undercut effective treatment of malaria, the mosquito-borne illness that kills 1.1 million people a year. In Thailand, for example, three of the most common anti-malaria drugs are virtually useless. Resistance to chloroquine, once the standard treatment, affects most of the 92 malaria-afflicted countries, the report said.</p>
        <p>The same patterns, involving a wide range of medications, hold true for the hundreds of millions afflicted with tuberculosis, diarrheal diseases, typhoid and viral hepatitis.</p>
        <p>Overuse of drugs in wealthy nations combined with underuse in poor ones speeds the natural process of bacteria evolving to survive, making standard treatments ineffective, the report said.</p>
        <p>A worrisome area is the use of antibiotics to hasten livestock growth, which is already banned in Europe, the agency said. Dr. Heymann said that as much as half of antibiotics use was in agriculture.</p>
        <p>That use results in the development of drug-resistant germs in or near livestock and heightens fears of new strains '' 'jumping' between species'' and causing illness in humans, the report said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Heymann warned against relying on the pharmaceutical industry to invent drugs to replace those that were becoming ineffective, citing the expense and the tendency to focus research in profitable areas.</p>
        <p>But, he said, ''We could cut infectious disease in half over the next decade if existing tools are used correctly.''</p>
