        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's high-profile if slightly messy exit from the race for Senate may not have helped his standing with Republican leaders, but he is doing just fine with voters. Mr. Giuliani is now viewed favorably by nearly half of New York State voters -- the highest personal rating he has received since he has been mayor, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll.</p>
        <p>Presumably, the warmer perception of Mr. Giuliani is a reflection of the warmer mayor on display since he announced he had cancer, was seeking to dissolve his marriage and was enjoying the company of a ''very good friend,'' Judith Nathan. But New Yorkers not only seem to like Mr. Giuliani better; they also have a higher opinion of how he is performing at City Hall.</p>
        <p>The poll found that New Yorkers approved of the way he was doing his job by two to one. By contrast, in the last Times/CBS poll, just 45 percent of respondents said in April that they approved of his job performance, compared with 40 percent who disapproved.</p>
        <p>His personal approval rating among New York City residents has jumped to 47 percent from a low of 32 percent in April. The Times/CBS poll in April was conducted in the midst of a furor over the way Mr. Giuliani had responded to the shooting of Patrick M. Dorismond, an unarmed black man shot by the police in March.</p>
        <p>The statewide poll of 1,845 adults, taken from June 4 to 10, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points, found that three-quarters of New York voters agreed with Mr. Giuliani's decision to bow out of the race for Senate, with just 14 percent saying they wished he had stuck it out. As to why he stepped aside, 42 percent accepted what Mr. Giuliani said was the reason: his need to focus on dealing with a diagnosis of prostate cancer. An additional 12 percent suggested that the real reason was his failing marriage, while nearly a third said both factors played a role.</p>
        <p>And does Mr. Giuliani have a political future in this town? Nearly half of New Yorkers polled suggested that they hoped he did, with positions ranging from governor (14 percent) to president of the United States (2 percent). Still, 39 percent said Mr. Giuliani should find a new line of work when his term as mayor expires at the end of 2001.</p>
