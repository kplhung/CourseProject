        <p>Re ''Bringing In Europe on Missile Defense'' (editorial, June 7):</p>
        <p>Europe's main concern with regard to missile defense is not that it would ''unravel the treaty system,'' but rather that closer cooperation between Russia and the United States would diminish further the relative importance of Europe. Since the breakup of the Soviet Union, Western Europe has done its best to alienate Russia through policies -- from rapid NATO expansion to Kosovo -- that the Clinton administration has eventually signed on to.</p>

        <p>Re ''Bringing In Europe on Missile Defense'' (editorial, June 7):</p>
        <p>Europe's main concern with regard to missile defense is not that it would ''unravel the treaty system,'' but rather that closer cooperation between Russia and the United States would diminish further the relative importance of Europe.

        <p>Continuing dialogue with our European allies is wise. But the Europeans remain military lightweights and unwilling to shoulder responsibility. Their self-serving views must not be allowed to obstruct security, ours or their own, or a deepening of American-Russian ties.</p>
