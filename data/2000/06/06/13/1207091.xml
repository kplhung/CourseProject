        <p>There was always something of a little boy in Steve Young, an enduring sense that he believed he was still playing football in his backyard, and not competing in a National Football League game with millions of people watching at home.</p>
        <p>When Young's helmet flew off during a scramble in a 1995 exhibition game -- an exhibition game -- Young did what came naturally: he ran for 8 more yards.</p>
        <p>Then, after he was tackled, a future Hall of Fame career continued as Young searched for his dislodged helmet.</p>
        <p>He was never affected by his fame or success. Instead, Young always seemed most happy on the field, playing with youthful spontaneity. There was something almost whimsical about such lack of restraint and it was part of his popularity, as was a sense of vulnerability. Vulnerability ultimately had a more implacable consequence: six concussions.</p>
        <p>Young retired yesterday, not at a swanky news conference in a fancy ballroom, but in the 49ers' locker room.</p>
        <p>''I thought, 'Where else?' '' he said.</p>
        <p>But while Young may have felt that at age 38 he could still play, no football fan ever felt cheated watching Young cavort on a football field.</p>
        <p>Sports fans and paid observers alike yearn to believe that some of our multimillionaire athletes truly play for the love of the game. In Young's case, we always had an ideal illustration.</p>
        <p>When he first turned pro, getting two bonus checks worth $2.5 million, Young didn't cash them for months, leaving them crumbled in the pocket of his blue jeans. When Young was Joe Montana's backup at San Francisco, he felt so guilty about collecting a hefty salary when he wasn't playing that he tossed his paychecks in a sock drawer, where they remained uncashed until his mother found them.</p>
        <p>Young didn't dwell on the repeated concussions -- four in the last four years -- but he knew some things had changed in his life with his marriage in March and with his wife, Barbara, expecting the couple's first child in December.</p>
        <p>''In many ways what lies ahead for me is more important than what I leave behind,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Young leaves behind a Hall of Fame career as the best running quarterback in N.F.L. history, who also compiled the highest career passing rating ever, 96.8. In 15 seasons he threw for 33,124 yards, 232 touchdowns and ran for 43 touchdowns, which is another N.F.L. record for a quarterback.</p>
        <p>And it was Young's mad dashes out of the pocket that symbolized his game, running with eyes wide and ball at arm's length, his legs zigzagging across the field as defenders comically dived and skidded in his wake. He played with heart and grit, and he was something else rarer still: a role model. Young was famously courteous in public and private, laudable, smart and giving of his time.</p>
        <p>He was also likable because he played the underdog so well. He came to Brigham Young University and was assigned the eighth spot on the quarterback depth chart behind Jim McMahon. The head coach told him to try out at wide receiver. Young persevered, as he did through three frustrating, fitful seasons with the United States Football League's Los Angeles Express and the woeful Tampa Bay Buccaneers.</p>
        <p>Then came his time in the shadow of Montana. Young showed up for his first 49ers practice without his football cleats. (Does that not sound like a kid at heart?) In a coincidence full of foreshadowing, the 49ers discovered that Young's feet were the same size as Montana's, and so Young literally readied himself as a 49er on that first day in Montana's shoes.</p>
        <p>He hoped Joe wouldn't notice. Joe did. Four years later, Young was filling Montana's shoes again. It was a rocky start.</p>
        <p>''I wanted people to like what I did,'' Young said of those seasons. ''They didn't. They wanted Joe.''</p>
        <p>There was plenty of disappointment along the way, always hauntingly on the brink of a Super Bowl, but finally Young's 49ers won the 1995 National Football Conference championship and Candlestick Park was filled with the chant, ''Steve! Steve!'' as Young took a lavish victory lap with arms raised.</p>
        <p>No one needed Sally Field to narrate the scene. They liked him; they really liked him.</p>
        <p>In the ensuing Super Bowl, Young threw a record six touchdowns in a 49-26 victory against San Diego. In the locker room after, Young looked buoyant and appreciative, though he added: ''I didn't need a Super Bowl to validate anything. I've enjoyed my career just as it was.''</p>
        <p>There was much to savor -- and not because of the seven Pro Bowl appearances or the two most valuable player awards or the six seasons with more than 3,000 passing yards.</p>
        <p>It was the joy Steve Young brought to the game. You could see it in those mad dashes upfield, with or without a helmet, for a paycheck or free, with zeal if not heedless abandon. That's what Steve Young gave to football.</p>
        <p>It was the joy of the game he instilled in those who watched him. Athletes like to talk about giving back to the game. That's what Steve Young gave to football. And he didn't need to give any more.</p>
