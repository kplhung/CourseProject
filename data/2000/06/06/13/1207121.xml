        <p>Nearly 50 years to the week since the Korean War began, the leaders of North and South Korea met this morning for a first-ever series of talks.</p>
        <p>With thousands of official greeters cheering his arrival in the North's capital, Pyongyang, President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea descended from a plane and was welcomed by the North Korean president, Kim Jong Il.</p>
        <p>They shook hands at length, and then walked together along a red carpet to review a military honor guard. The two men smiled and chatted as they walked to the visiting president's limousine, while the crowd chanted the name of Kim Jung Il, and ocassionally the name of Kim Dae Jung.</p>
        <p>In a surprise, the two men rode together in Kim Dae Jung's limousine, brought especially from South Korea, to the state guest house, where the visiting head of state will be staying.</p>
        <p>South Korean officials said they were delighted by the North Korean president's presence at the airport.</p>
        <p>''It was something we were not expecting at all,'' said one government official in Seoul. ''It is a very good sign.''</p>
        <p>He said the two presidents would go immediately into meetings together. Their schedule for the three-day summit meeting has been kept secret. It is known, however, that the two leaders intended to meet alone at least twice.</p>
        <p>Before setting off from Seoul, Kim Dae Jung said the entire world was ''welcoming and blessing this trip.'' He promised to listen clearly in order ''to broaden understanding between North and South Korea.''</p>
        <p>Then he asked his nation to ''please pray for me and wish for me a safe return.''</p>
        <p>The departure speech captured the sense of hope that surrounds this trip, as well as the deep uncertainties of dealing with North Korea, one of the world's most secretive and unpredictable nations.</p>
        <p>Thirty years ago, a northern commando raid penetrated Seoul in a failed bid to assassinate the president, Park Chung Hee. And just last year, North and South Korea fought a fierce naval skirmish in the Yellow Sea that began over fishing rights and briefly threatened to explode into a full-blown war.</p>
        <p>The Korean War, from 1950 to 1953, left millions of people dead, injured or missing, including Americans and Chinese. To this date, 37,000 Americans troops are deployed along the border.</p>
        <p>President Kim, who for many years was an outcast and a dissident, was imprisoned in South Korea and was even sentenced to death. But he was elected president and reached out to the North in his inaugural speech in February 1998, when he made a ringing call for an end to the cold war on the peninsula.</p>
        <p>Of late, his counterpart in the North has been taking steps to end its isolation, seeking to make or restore diplomatic relations with countries in the region and elsewhere.</p>
        <p>In an apt symbol of the divide between the two countries -- one an economically fragile Communist dynasty, the other a capitalist power and vibrant democracy -- Mr. Kim's jet took a long detour over the Yellow Sea rather than fly over the world's most heavily armed border.</p>
        <p>For most of the last two years, even as it suffered through diplomatic isolation, economic collapse and a widespread famine, the North's propaganda continued to scorn Mr. Kim, and his so-called Sunshine Policy toward Pyongyang, treating him as a puppet of the United States.</p>
        <p>But since Mr. Kim gave a speech in Berlin in March, pledging a huge commitment of resources from the relatively rich South to help rebuild the impoverished North, relations between the two countries began their dramatic shift.</p>
        <p>The Berlin speech coincided with surprising changes in North Korea's ties with the rest of the world, as the reclusive Kim Jong Il began some bold diplomatic moves.</p>
        <p>''This all began with our president's inauguration,'' said Kim Myong Shik, a spokesman for the South's government. ''Then came Berlin, and the North's opening. Now we have a summit. Don't think it will stop here.''</p>
        <p>While the two neighbors are largely responsible for this turnabout, both have been supported by their main allies, which are eager for peace but anxious to see their interests protected.</p>
        <p>Traveling outside North Korea for the first time since succeeding his father as leader in 1994, Kim Jong Il entered Beijing secretly by special train earlier this month, reaffirming the relationship between the two Communist countries, which fought together against American and southern troops in the Korean War.</p>
        <p>At practically the same time, the southern leader met in Tokyo with President Clinton and Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori of Japan.</p>
        <p>The United States and Japan are pushing for North Korea to end suspected programs to develop nuclear arms and other weapons of mass destruction. Japan was shocked in 1998 by a surprise test-firing of a North Korean missile that flew over its main island of Honshu, and it and suspended aid and diplomatic contacts with Pyongyang for two years.</p>
        <p>The Korean missile program has been the main threat used in Washington to justify the proposed development of a $60 billion antimissile shield.</p>
        <p>As a result of a carrot-and-stick effort by Washington conceived by a former defense secretary, William Perry, Pyongyang has suspended any firing of long-range ballistic missiles for the last year.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, for security reasons, Pyongyang has remained all but sealed. Visiting business people and tourist groups were banned weeks ago, and even accredited diplomats caught outside of the country during the preparations had to postpone their return.</p>
        <p>The contrast with Seoul could not be more evident. Here, the meeting has been the occasion for mass prayer sessions and parties alike, neither of which the tightly controlled and economically devastated North is particularly known for.</p>
        <p>North Korea, which rarely allows foreign journalists into the country anyway, has rejected all requests to cover the meetings except for 50 South Korean journalists who were allowed after protracted negotiations to visit.</p>
        <p>Other journalists are following the events from the official press center, at a hotel in Seoul, where wall-to-ceiling television screens are broadcasting live footage from Pyongyang.</p>
        <p>Many South Koreans say their most immediate hope is for a reunification of the 1.8 million people whose families were split up by the war.</p>
        <p>A close second is a reduction of military tensions on the peninsula, where both sides maintain huge armies, and North Korea has been testing ballistic missiles and is suspected of developing weapons of mass destruction, from nuclear warheads to chemical weapons.</p>
        <p>''People don't talk about war like they did when I was a child,'' said Park Kil Tae, a department store employee. ''But every now and then, you stop to think that Seoul could be destroyed in minutes.''</p>
        <p>Nicholas Eberstadt, a Korea specialist at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, said: ''All of the major players at the moment perceive their interests in immediate terms: wanting to have more stability on the peninsula, and kicking problems down the road. The United States, South Korea and Japan are all very vested in the Perry process, which is actually a kind of American version of President Kim's Sunshine Policy.''</p>
        <p>So far, Mr. Eberstadt added, China has benefited most from the detente. ''China has a divided Korea, with two governments both vying for Beijing's affection,'' he said. ''And all of the Pacific powers are soliciting China's cooperation over North Korea, including Washington.''</p>
