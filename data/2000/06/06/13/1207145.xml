        <p>In yet another effort to bring relief to his troubled right knee, Kerry Kittles will undergo arthroscopic surgery this week. Kittles, hampered by knee problems the past two seasons, has had three operations on the knee since 1997. There has been speculation within the Nets organization that Kittles may have to sit out next season. But Rod Thorn, the team's news president, said it is too early to make predictions.</p>
        <p>''He's going to have another operation, but we fully expect him to recover and be O.K. after that,'' Thorn said. ''You never know. Strange things can always happen. It's something we'll have to wait and see about.''</p>

        <p>In yet another effort to bring relief to his troubled right knee, Kerry Kittles will undergo arthroscopic surgery this week. Kittles, hampered by knee problems the past two seasons, has had three operations on the knee since 1997. There has been speculation within the Nets organization that Kittles may have to sit out next season. But Rod Thorn, the team's news president, said it is too early to make predictions.</p>
        <p>''He's going to have another operation, but we fully expect him to recover and be O.K. after that,'' Thorn said. ''You never know. Strange things can always happen. It's something we'll have to wait and see about.''</p>
        <p>Kittles, the Nets' starting shooting guard the past four years, could not be reached for comment.</p>
        <p>Though doctors declared Kittles ready to play, he sat out 13 of the first 14 games of last season while complaining about soreness in the knee. After playing with pain and stiffness for most of the season, Kittles missed the final 7 games. At the time, he was adamant about not having another operation.</p>
        <p>The Nets are already facing the probable end of Jayson Williams's career. Losing Kittles, who signed a six-year, $48.9 million contract in March of 1999, for a significant amount of time would be another serious blow.</p>
