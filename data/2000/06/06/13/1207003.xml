        <p>The lawsuits are the first to be filed individually by members of a group that brought a class-action suit last winter against the manufacturer, SmithKline Beecham, asking that it expand its vaccine labeling.

        <p>Three patients sued the maker of the new Lyme disease vaccine yesterday, contending that it had given them a severe form of arthritis.</p>
        <p>The lawsuits are the first to be filed individually by members of a group that brought a class-action suit last winter against the manufacturer, SmithKline Beecham, asking that it expand its vaccine labeling.  The class-action suit seeks to have the labels include the concerns of some scientists that a new form of so-called autoimmune arthritis -- in which the body's immune system begins to attack its own tissue -- could be triggered by the vaccine, which has been on the market since December 1998.</p>
        <p>Stephen A. Sheller, of Sheller, Ludwig &amp; Badey of Philadelphia, the firm that filed both the suits by individuals who seek personal damages  and the class-action suit, said a fourth patient has also filed a suit in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas, charging that the vaccine caused a resurgence of his apparently dormant Lyme disease. Mr. Sheller said the firm was also reviewing the complaints of more than 100 other patients.</p>
        <p>SmithKline Beechham said it had not seen the suits and could not comment but defended the safety of the vaccine. And Food and Drug Administration officials stood by their decision to approve the vaccine.</p>
        <p>Dr. Karen Elkins, the F.D.A. official who oversaw the vaccine's evaluation, said approval was warranted because any risks were far outweighed by the protection afforded by the vaccine for people who live in areas with high instances of Lyme disease. The agency also stressed that risks exist with all vaccines and that few cases of adverse reactions had been reported since the vaccine began to be sold.</p>
        <p>The F.D.A. said 500 cases of adverse effects have been reported from among the more than one million vaccine doses SmithKline Beecham says it has sold. Of those 500 cases, the agency said 45 were considered serious, which means an individual needed hospitalization, or developed a life-threatening illness or a permanent disability. Three cases involved reports of rheumatoid arthritis and 22 reported other forms of arthritis. None of the arthritis reports could be directly linked to the vaccine, the agency said.</p>
        <p>''We have not seen red flags in the data reported to the F.D.A,'' said Lenore Gelb, an agency spokeswoman. ''We continue to be closely monitoring the safety of the Lyme vaccine, and all serious reports are followed up on.''</p>
        <p>In one of the new suits, Lydia Marra of Ocean Township, N.J., a hospice nurse, said that a week after the second of three shots required for immunization she found herself in unbearable pain, and within months, she was so stiff and suffering such pain in her chest and arms that she could barely move for hours in the morning, and her husband would have to lift her out of bed. Her husband, Frank, also a plaintiff in the suit, said he developed the same form of arthritis that afflicts his wife after getting the vaccine.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit also accused Yale University of apparent conflicts of interest in developing and patenting the vaccine, taking part in its safety trials and then earning large profits on its sale. Yale and three of its researchers are named in the suit, but they were not made defendants.</p>
        <p>A Yale spokesman, Thomas P. Conroy, said the university had not seen the complaint, and that it was not aware of any conflicts of interest in its research on the vaccine.</p>
        <p>Yale researchers developed the vaccine in 1989, patented important aspects of it and share the royalties with the university. The allegation in the suits filed yesterday comes at a time when ethicists and scientists, including the editor of The New England Journal of Medicine, have begun expressing concern over the increasingly close ties between the academic and business worlds.</p>
        <p>F.D.A. officials conceded that some scientists had expressed concerns that people with a particular genetic complement, called HLA-DR4, might be susceptible to a form of autoimmune disease from the vaccine. The theory is that a genetically engineered piece of material in the vaccine closely resembles a natural protein in the human body and that the vaccine could prompt the body's immune system to attack its own tissue. Some estimates say 30 percent of the population has the HLA-DR4 marker.</p>
        <p>Dr. Elkins of the F.D.A. said no scientific evidence had been found to support the theory that the adverse reaction occurs in humans. But one study, published in February, did find such evidence in animals.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Marra's physician, Dr. Charlene C. Demarco, said Mrs. Marra tested positive for HLA-DR4 and so far had not responded to treatment.</p>
        <p>''Shouldn't I have been informed'' about the possible side effects? asked Mrs. Marra. ''Then if I wanted to take the risk, it would have been my decision to take it.''</p>
        <p>The vaccine is recommended only for people 15 through 70; for people who have not had active Lyme disease within the last three months; for those who do not have severe arthritis; and for those who live in, work in or frequent areas with high instances of the tick-borne disease, such as suburban and rural areas, particularly in the Northeast and the northern Midwest.</p>
        <p>Doctors generally restrict their advice to get the vaccine to patients in the recommended categories. In those cases, they say, the risks appear small while the benefits are substantial. Other doctors, however, take a wait-and-see attitude, saying that often with new vaccines unexpected adverse reactions do not appear for two years or so.</p>
        <p>Dr. Henry Feder, who treats Lyme patients at the University of Connecticut Medical Center in Farmington, Conn., said, ''I do worry about giving something that's dangerous that people don't absolutely need, but none of my patients or people have had adverse reactions.''</p>
        <p>But Dr. Laura Fisher, an infectious disease and Lyme specialist at New York Presbyterian Hospital, said, ''Personally, I'd sit tight another year and wait for more definitive answers because of specific concerns as well general concerns.'' She said more information was needed on whether certain patients would be more prone to autoimmune arthritis.  She said, too, that the vaccine trial lasted only 20 months, and ''that might not be long enough to show for serious side effects that were not at first appreciated.''</p>
