        <p>George W. Bush is hunkered down with his advisers in Kennebunkport this week, putting together plans for a completely positive Republican Convention in Philadelphia, a gathering so free of rancor that nobody will even attack the Democrats, let alone fight with fellow party members.</p>
        <p>If that isn't enough to send the public off to get acquainted with UPN summer programming, I don't know what is.</p>
        <p>''It'll be total boredom, I hope,'' said Senator John McCain, who has temporarily dropped his role as in-house troublemaker.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain, of course, is famous for speaking the truth even when it's incredibly dull. Mr. Bush's campaign is more into denial. ''The governor wants the focus to be on the policies and plans he believes will help build a strong 21st century. What makes you assume that's not watchable and enjoyable?'' sniffed a spokesman.</p>
        <p>If people will tune in to ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' reruns, perhaps they really will be open to ''Bush, the Next Generation.'' (Like ''Dynasty,'' only everybody's really, really nice.) But I'll bet you those guys in Kennebunkport are working like crazy on packaging. Possible innovations include:</p>
        <p>* Chairman to make all announcements wearing a purple dinosaur suit.</p>
        <p>* Replace the traditional ''attack Tuesday'' with production patterned after ''Survivor,'' featuring 16 elected Republican officials specially chosen for their ability to articulate centrist policy concerns while looking good in Ralph Lauren body flags. Contestants are stranded on a golf course, and the last person out of the sand trap will be nominated for vice president.</p>
        <p>* Children's interactive version of ''Where's Waldo?'' in which junior viewers will be challenged to find Lamar Alexander in a crowd.</p>
        <p>* A running convention story along the championship wrestling line, in which a team of ''villains'' repeatedly attempts to ruin things by introducing negative themes and divisive motions. In a climactic moment during prime time, Mr. Bush restores positive thinking by body-slamming ''Pat Buchanan'' (Steve Forbes in a rubber mask) and Newt Gingrich (playing himself).</p>
        <p>The Democrats' convention plans are less evolved, but seem capable of making Mr. Bush's coronation look like sweeps week programming. ''We expect the convention will focus  on Vice President Gore's biography and on his agenda for continuing the country's prosperity and progress,'' said a spokesman.</p>
        <p>Pat Buchanan and the Reform Party offer the best hope for spontaneous convention drama, having shown a remarkable yen for fratricidal bloodletting given the fact that there's only one candidate for the nomination. Recently an ousted Buchanan aide told Newsweek that Mr. Buchanan and his advisers were mulling the idea of asking radio's Dr. Laura Schlessinger to be his running mate.</p>
        <p>''There is no short list,'' said a Buchanan spokesman, raising hopes of what might be forthcoming from a campaign that will seriously respond to questions about Dr. Laura's vice-presidential prospects.</p>
        <p>We were hoping that if all else failed, the Other Race here in New York would provide relief. But things here have gotten incredibly dull since Rudy Giuliani dropped out. The new Republican candidate, Rick Lazio, was the target of a number of gibes at a satirical revue put on by Albany political reporters last weekend. Every single one was about the fact that he fell down in a Memorial Day parade two weeks ago. We've sure gotten a lot of mileage out of that split lip, and unless Mr. Lazio develops some new defining characteristics we may still be talking about it in October.</p>
        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton, by the way, had her first chance to deliver the mandatory self-deprecatory candidate rebuttal speech at the same event. ''You know, funny is not my deal,'' she ad-libbed, launching into a reminiscence about the public relations disaster that occurred when she inadvertently stiffed an upstate waitress out of a tip. (''You know who really got on my case for not tipping? Tipper.'') Clicking onto a picture of herself working on the Watergate committee, she murmured, ''This is from the good impeachment.''</p>
        <p>Best of all, she never once mentioned her agenda for the 21st century.</p>
