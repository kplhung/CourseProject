        <p>The murky future of a proposed Mohawk Indian casino in the Catskills became more clouded today as leaders of the State Senate prepared to pass a bill that would allow the casino to be built only if it is first approved by the Legislature.</p>
        <p>The Senate will probably pass the bill Tuesday, according to aides to Senator Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican majority leader, but it remains unclear whether it would meet with approval from the Democrats who control the Assembly.</p>
        <p>The bill is essentially the same as one proposed earlier this year by Gov. George E. Pataki, except for one crucial difference: where Mr. Pataki's bill granted permission for slot machines in Indian casinos, the Senate bill does not.</p>
        <p>Allowing slot machines has been an important part of the Pataki administration's agreement with several tribes to settle the Indians' claims to millions of acres of land around the state. The administration has held out to the tribes the prospect of gambling revenue, especially from slot machines, in return for dropping their land claims.</p>
        <p>''We think that the bill the governor put together is critical, and any changes to it we would look at skeptically,'' said Zenia Mucha, a senior adviser to the Mr. Pataki.</p>
        <p>Any law that would require legislative approval for casinos is widely viewed as making casino development less likely. Some Republican senators strongly oppose casinos, as do powerful Atlantic City gaming interests that can exercise considerable clout in the Capitol, as Donald Trump showed in 1997, when his lobbying and campaign contributions helped kill a proposed constitutional amendment to allow non-Indian casinos in New York.</p>
        <p>The St. Regis Mohawk tribe wants to build a casino in Monticello, in Sullivan County, far from its reservation along the St. Lawrence River. An obscure provision in federal law allows such off-reservation Indian casinos under some circumstances, and the proposal was approved in April by the Department of the Interior.</p>
        <p>But the future of the project was thrown into doubt a few weeks later when the tribe announced that it had dropped the company it had allied with to develop and operate the casino, and signed on with another partner, Park Place Entertainment. Park Place then disclosed that it was seeking to switch the site of the casino from Monticello Raceway to the Kutsher's Country Club nearby.</p>
        <p>Governors have long held that they, alone, had the power to approve or reject casinos that Indian tribes want to establish. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo permitted the state's two Indian casinos without legislative approval, entering into compacts with the Oneida Nation for the Turning Stone casino on the tribe's reservation near Syracuse, and with the Mohawks for a casino in Hogansburg, on their reservation. Neither casino has slot machines.</p>
        <p>So it was a surprise when, earlier this year, Mr. Pataki, a Republican, submitted a bill that would require legislative approval for any Indian casino not on Indian lands. He said it was a recognition that such a casino might be different, under the law, than those on reservations and an attempt to avoid a years-long lawsuit over whether he had the power to approve it himself.</p>
        <p>The governor insists he has not passed judgment on the Mohawk proposal, but he is seen by lawmakers and lobbyists here as firmly supporting it.</p>
        <p>The governor's bill would have allowed slot machines in Indian casinos, but Mr. Bruno and some of his colleagues are vehemently opposed to taking that step.</p>
