        <p>Under pressure from Congress, Egypt said today that it would pay $10.6 million to help cover the United States' costs related to the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990 last October. Those costs have so far run about $14 million and are expected to reach $17 million.</p>
        <p>The money from Egypt had been requested by Representative John J. Duncan Jr., chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee on Aviation, who had also introduced a bill to deduct half the American cost from foreign aid to Egypt if Cairo did not pay.</p>

        <p>Under pressure from Congress, Egypt said today that it would pay $10.6 million to help cover the United States' costs related to the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990 last October. Those costs have so far run about $14 million and are expected to reach $17 million.</p>
        <p>The money from Egypt had been requested by Representative John J. Duncan Jr., chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee on Aviation, who had also introduced a bill to deduct half the American cost from foreign aid to Egypt if Cairo did not pay.</p>
        <p>In a letter to Mr. Duncan, Republican of Tennessee, the Egyptian ambassador, Nabil Fahmy, said Egypt would pay $5 million immediately and the rest ''expeditiously.''</p>
        <p>Under international treaty, investigation of the crash was the responsibility of Egypt, because the plane was registered there and went down in international waters, off Nantucket. Under the treaty, the United States would have had ''observer'' status, because the plane, a Boeing 767, was manufactured here. In this case, however, the Egyptian government delegated its responsibility to the American government, a rare development.</p>
