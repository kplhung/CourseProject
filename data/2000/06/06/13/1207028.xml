        <p>Campaign advertising so overwhelms political news coverage on local television across the country that on many stations the campaign is evolving into an almost exclusively paid enterprise, according to two studies to be released today.</p>
        <p>In one study, researchers for the Alliance for Better Campaigns, a Washington advocacy group, found that television stations in the nation's top 75 media markets took in a record $114 million from candidates for 151,000 commercials in the first four months of this year.</p>
        <p>But most stations, the researchers added, did not come close to providing the five minutes a night of air time for candidates' remarks that was recommended in 1998 by a White House commission of broadcast executives and political scientists.</p>
        <p>In fact, some stations, in major cities as diverse as Tampa, Fla., and Philadelphia, offered as little as an average of six seconds a night.</p>
        <p>''The picture of politics has become all ads, all the time,'' said Paul Taylor, a former political reporter  who heads the Alliance for Better Campaigns. More and more, Mr. Taylor added, ''what viewers are getting is the money-driven, synthetic discourse of ads.''</p>
        <p>The alliance study cited the Senate primary in New Jersey, in which the winning Democrat, Jon S. Corzine, overwhelmed all other candidates with 3,711 commercials on four New York and Philadelphia stations in the three months before the election. The alliance estimated that viewers of those channels were 10 times more likely to see a campaign commercial than a campaign news report.</p>
        <p>In a separate study, the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Southern California examined coverage of the candidates in the 30 days before a primary on 19 top-rated stations in 11 cities.</p>
        <p>While 3 of those stations devoted about 4 minutes a night to the candidates' statements, 16 others provided an average of only 39 seconds of coverage. The survey included outlets in pivotal primary states like New Hampshire and Iowa, and large cities like New York and Los Angeles. One station in the study, WHO in Des Moines, is owned by The New York Times Company.</p>
        <p>Martin Kaplan, a former speechwriter for Vice President Walter F. Mondale who is now associate dean of the Annenberg School, said the results show how evening news programs have begun to marginalize civic affairs. Many stations, Mr. Kaplan said, no longer assign a reporter to cover politics full time, even in an election year. ''Why should you cover politics when you can cover a good car chase?'' he asked.</p>
        <p>Local television is one of the predominant sources of information for Americans, and politicians and public interest groups have long been trying to pressure local stations to improve coverage. In December 1998, a presidential commission examining the responsibilities of television recommended that network and local news operations devote five minutes each night to ''candidate-centered discourse'' in the 30 days before an election.</p>
        <p>The time was to be in addition to the horse-race style of political reporting that researchers said dominates television coverage. The panel, known as the Gore Commission because it reported to Vice President Al Gore, said that decisions on how to deliver the five minutes would be left to the stations and could come in several forms, such as debates, interviews with the candidates or issue statements.</p>
        <p>''However, few broadcasters have formally committed to the proposed standard, just two dozen of more than 1,300 stations,'' the alliance report concluded. ''The vast bulk of the industry, including all the major networks and the eight largest station groups, has ignored the proposal.''</p>
        <p>Industry representatives said that filling five minutes with the voices of candidates is not easy.</p>
        <p>''One of the recurring problems faced by broadcasters is that when we offer free air time to candidates we get rejected,'' said Dennis Wharton, a spokesman for the National Association of Broadcasters. ''When incumbents with a 95 percent name recognition are given the option of debating an opponent with 5 percent name recognition they turn broadcasters down routinely.''</p>
        <p>Leslie Moonves, the president of CBS Television and one of the chairmen of the Gore Commission, said, ''Simply offering free time when candidates and groups can continue to spend unlimited sums on television will do little to bring about the kind of reform the American public seeks or deserves.''</p>
        <p>Even the station that fared best in the Annenberg study said that finding ways to fill the time was arduous.</p>
        <p>Paul La Camera, general manager of WCVB, a Hearst-Argyle Television station in Boston, said efforts to hold a series of debates before the New Hampshire primary faltered because only two of the four leading contenders in each party, Mr. Gore and Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, would agree to participate.</p>
        <p>Still, WCVB provided an average of 4 minutes and 19 seconds of candidate discourse each night, and Mr. La Camera said he was pleased with the nightly mix of debate excerpts and extended sound bites. ''So it allowed us to play some role,'' he said, adding that the initiative did not hurt ratings.</p>
