        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Too Much in Touch,'' by William Safire (column, June 8):</p>
        <p>Should Mr. Safire see me glancing at my Palm Pilot while I am waiting for the subway, or for my sandwich at the deli, he might be surprised to know that I am reading Shakespeare's sonnets.</p>
        <p>Although I could carry a book of the sonnets, I have a lot fewer things to carry this way, and can even read them while waiting for a friend to arrive at one of those very dark restaurants, or waiting for a bus, or in a taxi at night. My goal is to learn a sonnet each week, and it is handy to have them at my fingertips where I can easily learn a line or two in those minutes during the day when one can take a moment to be alone.</p>
        <p>These electronic devices can sometimes enhance one's solitary time!</p>
