        <p>YESTERDAY was one of those classic muggy Baltimore afternoons. Everything thick and pasty. This was the first day of minicamp, the beginning of a new National Football League season.</p>
        <p>Near the end of practice the Ravens' offense was going against the defense in no-contact passing drills. There was a pass to Shannon Sharpe. The veteran tight end hauled it in.</p>
        <p>From out of the blue, Ray Lewis, the team's 25-year-old linebacker, tackled Sharpe. Not hard, but solidly enough so Sharpe knew he had been hit.</p>
        <p>On another day, in another context, Lewis's tough play might be interpreted as a tone setter for one of the N.F.L.'s up-and-coming, rough-and-tumble teams. Or it might have triggered one of those intramural fights.</p>
        <p>But this afternoon, on the first day of Ray Lewis's new life, the tackle was more like a multilayered love tap that announced: Hello, I'm back. I'm so relieved to be back. So happy to be back here, in this space and time, in this element. I just wanted to let you all know.</p>
        <p>''He probably couldn't wait to get on the field and just do what he's supposed to be doing,'' said Harry Swayne, the 35-year-old offensive tackle. ''He probably didn't notice that it was 100 degrees out there.''</p>
        <p>After practice, Sharpe laughed about Lewis's tackle.</p>
        <p>''I knew he'd be there,'' Sharpe said. ''But I didn't expect for him to tackle me. Now I guess I'll have to charge him rent.''</p>
        <p>While Lewis was on trial in Atlanta during the last several weeks, Sharpe became Lewis's archangel, drill sergeant and anchor. Lewis stayed in Sharpe's Atlanta home. Between court appearances, Lewis worked out daily, whether he wanted to or not, with Sharpe and his personal trainer. When Lewis felt too stressed out to work out, too preoccupied with what might happen in the trial, Sharpe forced him to work.</p>
        <p>So yesterday's tackle was a small payback and a thank you. ''I feel good,'' Lewis said. ''After 15 years you just don't lose it. I felt comfortable out there today.''</p>
        <p>So, now what?</p>
        <p>Where do young Ray Lewis and the promising, rapidly rising Baltimore Ravens go from here? In some way the circle was completed yesterday. A couple of hours after the practice, a jury in Atlanta acquitted two former co-defendants of Lewis of murder and assault charges in the stabbings of two men after a post-Super Bowl party. In a plea agreement last week, Lewis pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor obstruction-of-justice charge.</p>
        <p>Brian Billick, the Ravens' second-year head coach, said his team must put the trial and its publicity behind. ''Clearly, as a team, there is a certain bonding effect in terms of having one of your own go through this situation,'' he said. ''The pervading mentality amongst the players and the organization would be that in this situation Ray Lewis was wronged.''</p>
        <p>Rod Woodson, the veteran cornerback, spoke of the two who died. ''That's unfortunate,'' he said. ''We all feel for the families. We feel fortunate for Ray; he didn't do anything. We're glad he's out of it.''</p>
        <p>But will he ever be out of this?</p>
        <p>Lewis will no longer simply be the Ravens' great young linebacker. Depending on who's doing the describing, Lewis will be the great young linebacker who was unjustly prosecuted, or the great young linebacker who lied to the police, or the man who got off because he is the Ravens' great young linebacker.</p>
        <p>Modern professional athletes are surrounded by support programs. There are programs for domestic abuse, for drug counseling, for life after football. Every team has a chaplain.</p>
        <p>But no team has a full-time chaperon, and in the blink of an eye, for a good time, a player may forget about the glass house he lives in. Lewis may not. But how many will?</p>
        <p>Yesterday Earnest Byner, the Ravens' director of player development, wondered how many players would take the Ray Lewis lesson to heart. ''How long will it last?'' asked Byner, who played 14 N.F.L. seasons. ''Everyone is running scared now, but how long will it last?''</p>
        <p>Someone asked Byner his own question: How long? ''Two weeks,'' he said. ''Unfortunately that 'it's not going to happen to me' syndrome will continue.''</p>
        <p>For yesterday, at least, the family was back intact, a semblance of peace restored.</p>
