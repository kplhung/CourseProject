      <abstract>
        <p>Dr Jan McDonnell letter on June 6 article notes variant of human papilloma virus may have killed Juan Peron's first wife, who died of cervical cancer, and he may have infected his second wife, Eva, with virus, resulting in her death from cervical cancer</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''From the Life of Evita, a New Chapter on Medical Secrecy'' (June 6): The Doctor's World column stated that Eva Peron had cervical cancer, the same disease that killed Juan Peron's first wife.</p>
        <p>Given what is now known about cancer of the cervix, the possibility exists that Peron infected both wives with a particularly aggressive variant of human papilloma virus, causing the cancer in both, or that his first wife infected him and he passed the infection along to Eva. That form of cancer is a major killer of women, disproportionately affecting young women like the second Mrs. Peron.</p>

        <p>Peron is neither the first nor probably the last man to lose more than one sexual partner to this disease.</p>
