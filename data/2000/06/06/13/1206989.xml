        <p>Cultural Cornucopia</p>
        <p>Five hundred events are scheduled over 16 days in three Connecticut cities for the 2000 International Festival of Arts and Ideas, which begins on Friday. In its fifth year the festival is expanding from New Haven to offer programs in Stamford and New London. The Metropolitan Opera will present a free performance of ''Madama Butterfly'' on the Green in New Haven on June 30. Opening night attractions in New Haven include the Royal Shakespeare Company's ''Macbeth'' at the Long Wharf Theater and the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company's ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' at the Shubert Performing Arts Center.</p>
        <p>Words and Music</p>
        <p>Their first show flopped. Their next ran for five months. And then they wrote hit after hit: ''Brigadoon'' (1947), ''Paint Your Wagon'' (1951), ''My Fair Lady'' (1956), ''Camelot'' (1960) and ''Gigi'' (1973). Their names were Alan J. Lerner (1918-1986) and Frederick Loewe (1904-1988). To salute Lerner, the lyricist and playwright, in Carnegie Hall's annual American Popular Song Celebration, not one but two programs will be needed. This retrospective of his musicals and his collaborators, ''Carnegie Hall Celebrates Lerner and Loewe and . . . ,'' starts at 7:30 on Wednesday night when jazz, cabaret and Broadway performers like Christine Andreas, Kristin Chenoweth, Mary Cleere Haran, Faith Prince and Elaine Stritch are to appear with a 13-piece orchestra in a cabaret-style format. At 7:30 on Thursday night performers like Ms. Chenoweth, Robert Goulet and Debbie Gravitte and a 30-piece band are to spotlight Lerner with his best-loved and lesser-known songs.</p>
        <p>Rolling On</p>
        <p>With 20 performers, an onstage orchestra and projections from the original Broadway production, a new staging of ''The Who's 'Tommy,' '' comes rocking into Prudential Hall at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark at 7:30 tonight for seven performances through Sunday. The Tony Award-winning 1993 musical by Pete Townshend and Des McAnuff chronicles the adventures of young Tommy Walker from childhood trauma to Pinball Wizard.</p>
        <p>Man in Motion</p>
        <p>Kent Nagano is adding another hat. On July 1, 2001, this California-born conductor will become the first principal conductor of the Los Angeles Opera in its 14-year history, said Placido Domingo, the company's artistic director designate. In September, after relinquishing his post as music director of the Halle Orchestra in Manchester, England, Mr. Nagano will become the music director of the Deutsche Symphonie in Berlin. Until recently he was the music director of the Opera National of Lyon, France.</p>
