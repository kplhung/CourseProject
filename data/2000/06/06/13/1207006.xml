        <p>Richard Rothstein's Lessons column about the wisdom of teaching both creationism and evolution in schools (Education page, June 7) misses an important point.</p>
        <p>The world around us is inherently understandable. We can understand the history of the Earth by looking at what is recorded in the rocks; the history of life through fossils; and the history of the universe from the stars and galaxies.</p>
        <p>This process of observing the world and developing laws, hypotheses and theories about how it works is what we call science. Creationism is not science and should not be taught as such.</p>
        <p>While the importance of science in our society is increasing, issues like this are dividing us into increasingly antagonistic factions. We will not resolve this by mandating what schools can teach, but by engaging in constructive dialogues at all levels in society.</p>
