        <p>The Justice Department rebuked Microsoft in a court filing today, saying the company's request for a stay of the trial judge's ruling against it last week was actually a disingenuous attempt ''to manipulate the court'' and thwart taking the antitrust case directly to the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>A law known as the Expediting Act allows antitrust cases ''of general public importance'' to be sent directly to the Supreme Court for review, and Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson says he favors such a step. Last week senior Justice Department officials said they intended to invoke the Expediting Act.</p>
        <p>But Microsoft wants to take the case to the Court of Appeals, which has issued rulings favorable to Microsoft in the past.</p>
        <p>Microsoft called the government filing ''extremely bizarre'' and said it would lead to unnecessary delay.</p>
        <p>''These kinds of stay requests are the normal way appeals are handled, and we don't understand why the Justice Department felt a need to respond in this way,'' said Jim Cullinan, a Microsoft spokesman.</p>
        <p>Last Wednesday, Judge Jackson ended the long-running antitrust trial with an order that Microsoft be broken up into two companies. The company was also ordered to comply with a long list of restrictions on its business practices known as conduct remedies. Under Judge Jackson's order, the breakup is automatically stayed until appeals are complete, but the conduct remedies would take effect in October.</p>
        <p>Almost immediately, Microsoft filed a motion asking Judge Jackson to stay the entire order, pending appeal. But the company has not filed a notice of an appeal.</p>
        <p>The argument revolves around the appeals procedure. Microsoft says it will not file its notice of appeal until Judge Jackson rules on its request for a stay of last week's remedy order. And the government cannot ask the Supreme Court to take the case until the overall appeal is filed.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department charged today that Microsoft's real intent was to use Judge Jackson's almost certain rejection of the stay request ''so that it can then simultaneously file a lengthy and detailed motion for a stay in the Court of Appeals,'' confusing the issue while the government is simultaneously trying to take the case to the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>The government is concerned that if the appeals court were already deliberating on a request to stay the conduct remedies, the Supreme Court might be less likely to accept the case. With its brief, the government included a draft version of the motion for certification to the Supreme Court. The draft says the case clearly fits the standard set in the law for direct appeals because ''the markets found by the court to be the loci of Microsoft's illegal conduct'' are ''global markets that affect hundreds of millions of consumers and businesses throughout the world.</p>
        <p>''The public interest would be served by a prompt decision that would end uncertainty about the remedy facing Microsoft's employees, stockholders and firms in the technology industry and throughout the economy that do business with it,'' the government said.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, the government argued against a stay of the remedy order, saying the ongoing harm to competition from Microsoft is ''so substantial and pervasive in a fast-moving sector of the economy,'' that ''the irreparable injury to the public interest is particularly great.''</p>
        <p>Still, the Justice Department asked Judge Jackson not to rule on the stay request for now but to wait instead for Microsoft's appeal. Then, the government suggests, the judge should certify both requests to the Supreme Court for decisions.</p>
        <p>With that, the government gave Judge Jackson a draft scheduling order that would allow briefs and counterbriefs on these issues over the next 10 days.</p>
