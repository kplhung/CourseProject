        <p>President Vladimir V. Putin appointed a Muslim cleric today to govern Chechnya, a move intended to legitimize the Russian intervention in the breakaway republic and to help the Kremlin tighten its grip on the region.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin said the new leader, Mufti Akhmed Kadyrov, a Chechen, would have the support of his people. But many Chechens distrust leaders who have sided with the Russians, and it will be difficult for him to establish authority.</p>
        <p>Aslan Maskhadov, the president of Chechnya before the Russians intervened in 1994, has denounced the mufti as a traitor. The cleric has already been the target of several assassination attempts, including a bombing last month that wounded his son.</p>
        <p>His appointment also follows a wave of attacks in Chechnya, including in areas supposedly controlled by Russian forces, making the republic more dangerous and harder to govern than ever. Grozny, the capital, which Russian forces captured with great fanfare earlier this year, has become the scene of grisly firefights.</p>
        <p>On Friday several Russian doctors were killed when their carefully marked emergency vehicle was fired on in broad daylight. On Sunday, a separatist fighter set off a car bomb at a Grozny checkpoint, killing two militiamen and himself.</p>
        <p>And today, a national holiday that commemorates the establishment of Russia as an independent state, rebel fighters attacked a Russian police convoy on the outskirts of Argun, just east of Grozny.</p>
        <p>There was some good news: Russian forces rescued a French freelance photographer, Brice Fleutiaux, after eight months in captivity. He had been seized by Chechens after entering the republic from Georgia without a visa. The captors had demanded a $1.5 million ransom.</p>
        <p>But in general the situation has been so uncertain that the Russian government last week formally shelved plans to hold elections in Chechnya. Instead Mr. Putin announced that an administration would be established under his direct control.</p>
        <p>One of Mr. Putin's first acts in this direction was to appoint Mufti Kadyrov, the first Chechen leader to be installed by Moscow since 1996. He was not the only candidate for the post; Moscow has sought to work with a number of Chechens, some of whom vied for the post.</p>
        <p>One was Bislan Gantamirov, a former mayor of Grozny who was jailed for embezzlement and released so he could join the Russian side. Mr. Gantamirov and his militia fought with the Russian troops. An avenue in Grozny was later named after him, and his men maintained order in Urus Martan, a city in southern Chechnya that was a Gantamirov stronghold.</p>
        <p>But problems developed between him and the Russians. Russian authorities recently dismissed him from his paramilitary position, saying he and his men had abandoned their posts, taking their weapons with him.</p>
        <p>There were other Chechen candidates, like Ruslan Khasbulatov, who had been speaker of the Russian Parliament, and Malik Saidullayev, a businessman in Moscow. But Mufti Kadyrov was always the favorite.</p>
        <p>The mufti opposed the Russians during the first Chechen war in 1994-96 and supported Mr. Maskhadov, who is still popular among many Chechens. The Kremlin, in fact, alternates between trying to negotiate with Mr. Maskhadov, who is believed to be hiding in the southern mountains, and trying to attack him.</p>
        <p>But as the second Chechen war began, Mufti Kadyrov broke with Mr. Maskhadov and negotiated with the Russians. The cleric is said to be linked to the Yamadayev brothers, who control Gudermes, Chechnya's second-largest city. And he helped organize the surrender of Gudermes to Russian forces last year. He has also met with Mr. Putin.</p>
        <p>Even in Gudermes, however, the cleric's security could not be assured. Surrounded by bodyguards, the mufti traveled in a motorcade of identical white cars with darkened windows that raced through the streets.</p>
        <p>In addition to his religious credentials, Mufti Kadyrov has sought to broaden his appeal by promising to restore normal life.</p>
        <p>''There is no place in Chechnya for those who bring evil and war to the republic,'' he said in January. ''I see Chechnya's future without war.''</p>
        <p>But unlike many Chechens, the mufti has publicly endorsed the open-ended deployment of Russian troops, saying that the Chechens are not capable of settling their differences by themselves.</p>
        <p>Those comments made the mufti the favorite of some top Russian generals. Col. Gen. Gennady Troshev, the commander of Russian troops in the North Caucasus, praised his appointment.</p>
        <p>''Let it be for a transitional period,'' General Troshev said. ''Later, people can elect a president, a different head of administration. But today Mufti Kadyrov is a man all of Chechnya knows.''</p>
