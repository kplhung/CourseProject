        <p>The Greek composer Mikis Theodorakis is best known in the United States as a composer of music for film soundtracks, most notably ''Zorba the Greek,'' ''Serpico'' and ''Z.'' But his name regularly crops up in other contexts as well. Having studied composition in Paris with Messiaen and had an early hit with a ballet, ''Antigone,'' he became disillusioned with what he regarded as the limitations of the classical music world and became captivated by the idea of combining high and low art. He began writing art songs with bouzouki accompaniments, as well as overtly popular songs, some of which found a life in translation outside Greece.</p>
        <p>In the 1980's Mr. Theodorakis's interest in classical forms was rekindled, and although his works are rarely performed in New York he has been fairly prolific. Among his recent projects was a trilogy of operas based on ancient Greek drama, and on Sunday afternoon Peter Tiboris led the American premiere of the second in the series, ''Electra'' (1995), in a concert version at Carnegie Hall.</p>
        <p>The story, based on the Sophocles version, is familiar from the more venerable Strauss opera, although here Orestes makes short work of slaughtering Clytemnestra and Aegisthus, to the general celebration of the Mycenaeans. Electra does not have an ecstatic dance and does not die, and Orestes is not tormented by the Furies.</p>
        <p>A more telling musical difference between Strauss's ''Elektra'' and Mr. Theodorakis's opera, though, is that where Strauss used the story as a canvas on which to paint a thoroughly Straussian opera, Mr. Theodorakis's score seeks to evoke the spirit of Greek antiquity -- or at least a cinematic version of that spirit. The vocal writing is generally slow and stately, with melodies that convey the character of grand pronouncements. The orchestration is large and lush, with percussion writing that often gives the music a ritualistic solemnity. And a chorus comments on what has been said, or on what the character who has just finished singing actually feels, adding a slightly oracular touch to the proceedings.</p>
        <p>All told, this talky opera is a succession of monumental gestures: a listener was tempted to envision the action being performed in slow motion by eyeless bronze or marble statues. That had a certain exotic charm although, at nearly three hours, the rich orchestral fabric began to seem slightly oppressive. Another image that came to mind was of being marooned in a seemingly bottomless tub of chocolate mousse.</p>
        <p>The work was sung in Greek, with supertitles, and for the occasion, Mr. Tiboris imported a cast of Greek singers. The most powerful of the singers were Reveka Evangelia Mavrovitis, the mezzo-soprano who sang the title role, and Tassis Christoyannis, the baritone who sang Orestes. Both projected well over the full-throttle orchestration, and did much to create a sense of their strong-willed characters. Much the same can be said for Ioanna Forti, whose dark contralto gave Clytemnestra's music a sinister edge. Medea Iassonidi was a generally appealing Chrysothemis, but occasionally had trouble making herself heard.</p>
        <p>There were also fine contributions in the smaller roles from Yannis Christopoulos (Aegisthus), Angelo Simos (Pylades) and Pavlos Maropoulos (the tutor). There were a few orchestral mishaps, but for the most part he drew a polished and unflaggingly energetic performance from the Manhattan Philharmonic.</p>
