        <p>Hundreds of rock-throwing demonstrators have attacked United Nations offices in Congo in recent days, United Nations officials said today.</p>
        <p>They said the attacks appeared to reflect a government-inspired campaign, with President Laurent Kabila hardening his resistance to internationally supported political talks about the country's future.</p>
        <p>The orchestrated hostility toward the United Nations in Kinshasa, the capital, and recent fighting between the government's two main enemies in the city of Kisangani, which they occupy, have unsettled Congo and participants on both sides of the war.</p>
        <p>The events call into question not only the immediate hopes for a high-level meeting on Congo politics in the Security Council this week, but also the future of a United Nations peacekeeping force in the country.</p>
        <p>Secretary General Kofi Annan called all members of the Security Council to a private meeting with him tonight to discuss the newest Congo crisis and other peacekeeping operations; he is expected to release a report this week about the prognosis for peacekeeping there.</p>
        <p>Although United Nations observers were able to report that Kisangani was quiet today, repeated outbursts of fighting send a frightening message to would-be peacekeepers, especially after the debacle of hostage-taking in Sierra Leone last month. Violence against United Nations officials in Kinshasa adds to the alarm here.</p>
        <p>Attacks on the United Nations headquarters in Kinshasa, which began Friday and continued into the weekend, damaged the building and vehicles. The demonstrations, which officials said took place in the presence of police officers, have been coupled with pictures on television of unidentified foreigners being accosted and in at least one case ''necklaced'' with a burning tire. But the pictures may have been fabricated or pulled from archives, and shown as a sort of threat.</p>
        <p>There have also been reports by Reuters in Kinshasa that four government ministers had been detained by security services during the last week (one was subsequently released). That suggests a deteriorating political situation within Mr. Kabila's government.</p>
        <p>All of this takes place as the United Nations begins to search for peacekeepers and the money to put them in the field.</p>
        <p>''The events of the last week will not make Congressional approval of our contribution any easier,'' said Richard C. Holbrooke, the United States ambassador. ''And it is also understandable if countries will be more reluctant to send in troops.''</p>
        <p>The United Nations had hoped to persuade South Africa to send the first peacekeeping contingent to Congo, to be based in Kisangani, which officials had hoped to turn into neutral territory.</p>
        <p>Since coming to power with the overthrow of Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997, President Kabila has been a suspicious and difficult leader to deal with, inside and outside Congo, officials from the United Nations and numerous governments including the United States have found.</p>
        <p>In Congo, formerly Zaire, he has suppressed political expression and has refused to consider elections, even to legitimize his power. In the region, he antagonized his former allies, Rwanda and Uganda, which invaded Congo in 1998; by then they were aligned with Congolese rebels.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kabila has made and broken promises of cooperation with the United Nations or other African countries, including those with whom he signed a peace accord a year ago in Zambia. On a visit to New York to speak to the Security Council in January, Mr. Kabila laid the blame for continued fighting in Congo on the Rwandans and Ugandans. They counter that he has allowed his territory to be used for attacks on them.</p>
        <p>When Rwanda and Uganda began to fight between themselves in the diamond center of Kisangani last month and again last week, some diplomats say, Mr. Kabila may have taken the opportunity to settle some political scores within his own government.</p>
        <p>At the same time, he began stepping up opposition to the work of an African facilitator -- no one is using the word mediator -- appointed by the Organization of African Unity to try to reconcile Congolese political factions while the United Nations worked to help untangle conflicting military alliances.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Kabila's government said it would no longer work with the facilitator, Sir Ketumile Masire, a former president of Botswana. Diplomats and aides to Mr. Kabila said he saw Mr. Masire as a kind of Trojan horse, opening the way to a political opposition that could ultimately topple him.</p>
        <p>African diplomats said that Mr. Kabila was also afraid that his old friend and now nemesis, President Paul Kagame of Rwanda, would use a political dialogue in Congo to bolster some more pliant candidate against the president.</p>
        <p>Ten days ago, Mr. Kabila flew to Kenya unexpectedly for a long meeting with Mr. Kagame, but no diplomatic or political gains were apparent.</p>
