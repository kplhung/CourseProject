        <p>Gov. George Pataki says he supports it whole-heartedly. In theory, so do the Republican and Democratic leaders of New York State's Legislature.

        <p>That would be an unacceptable abdication of responsibility. For three years Albany has been dawdling over Judge Kaye's carefully wrought proposal to scrap the state's goofy organization chart of 11 separate trial courts. Judge Kaye recommends a streamlined structure that would be simple for New Yorkers to navigate and allow for easy shifting of judicial personnel and limited court resources depending on need.</p>

        <p>Gov. George Pataki says he supports it whole-heartedly. In theory, so do the Republican and Democratic leaders of New York State's Legislature. Yet once again it seems that lawmakers will go home without acting on Chief Judge Judith Kaye's sensible plan to restructure the state's inefficient and hopelessly complicated court system.</p>
        <p>That would be an unacceptable abdication of responsibility. For three years Albany has been dawdling over Judge Kaye's carefully wrought proposal to scrap the state's goofy organization chart of 11 separate trial courts. Judge Kaye recommends a streamlined structure that would be simple for New Yorkers to navigate and allow for easy shifting of judicial personnel and limited court resources depending on need.</p>
        <p>The timing is critical. Because the overhaul requires amending the State Constitution, any court-merger bill must be approved by two separately elected Legislatures and by the voters. If the current legislative session ends next week without producing a bill, the effect would be to put off reform until 2004 at the earliest.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, given everyone's familiarity with the issue and Albany's penchant for last-minute negotiations, there is still sufficient time to work out the details of an overhaul that would be of enduring value to the state's justice system. There is no good reason to exclude the Surrogate's Court, long a repository of political patronage, from the final compromise. Governor Pataki should convene an emergency meeting of the legislative leadership to approve a court reorganization that offers genuine reform.</p>
