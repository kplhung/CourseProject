        <p>A former member of the New York State Parole Board was charged yesterday with repeatedly lying before a federal grand jury when questioned about whether the board had given preferential treatment to an inmate whose friends and family contributed to Gov. George E. Pataki's 1994 election campaign.</p>
        <p>In an indictment unsealed in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, the former board member, Leo S. Levy, was accused of misleading investigators looking into the early release of John Kim, a gang member who was serving time for violent felonies and was freed by the board in April 1996.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy is the fourth person -- and the third state official -- to be charged in the two-and-a-half-year  grand jury investigation into accusations that Pataki campaign officials used the promise of early parole to drum up campaign contributions. The accusations have been embarrassing for Mr. Pataki, who has sought to eliminate parole entirely and has made it tougher for violent felons to win release on parole.</p>
        <p>In November, Sean McSherry, a former Parole Board member who led the three-member panel that heard the case of Mr. Kim, was sentenced to two years in federal prison for perjury and obstruction of justice. Ronald Hotaling, the former executive secretary to the Parole Board, pleaded guilty in August to lying to federal officials and said he had been informed that the governor's office had expressed a strong interest in the Kim case.</p>
        <p>In December, Yung Soo Yoo, a New Jersey businessman and a volunteer Republican Party fund-raiser, was accused of promising favorable state parole rulings to the families of three convicted violent felons, including Mr. Kim's, in exchange for more than $36,000 in donations to Mr. Pataki's campaign. Mr. Yoo is scheduled to go on trial in Federal District Court in Brooklyn next month.</p>
        <p>The investigation by the United States attorney's office into the influence-peddling allegations began in January 1998 after the parents of a man convicted with Mr. Kim said Mr. Yoo and Patrick Donohue, a top Pataki campaign aide, had guaranteed that their son would gain an early parole if they contributed to the governor's 1994 campaign. Investigators later found letters and memos from the governor's office to the Parole Board concerning Mr. Kim and two other Korean-American inmates whose families had contributed to the Pataki campaign. Mr. Donohue has not been charged.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kim, who was released after serving the minimum of a 4-to-12-year sentence for committing three armed robberies in Queens, is the son of the Rev. Nam Soo Kim, a prominent Korean-American minister in Queens who contributed $1,000 to the Pataki election campaign. Others linked to the minister gave several thousand dollars more to the campaign, officials involved in the case said.</p>
        <p>The federal prosecutors who are overseeing the investigation have repeatedly said no evidence suggests that Mr. Pataki participated in or had knowledge of the various crimes alleged. Michael F. McKeon, a spokesman for the governor, has strenuously denied in the past that officials engaged in any wrongdoing, but did not return telephone calls last night seeking comment.</p>
        <p>The federal government is also focusing on a similar but separate case involving possible lenient treatment given by parole officials to Shlomo Helbrans, a Hasidic rabbi imprisoned in a widely publicized kidnapping case. Rabbi Helbrans was deported to Israel in May, his lawyer has said, but federal officials say their investigation is continuing.</p>
        <p>The indictment released yesterday against Mr. Levy charges him with perjury and obstruction of justice in connection with his testimony before the grand jury. For example, it accuses him of testifying that a parole officer named Thomas Burke was present at Mr. Kim's hearing; the government maintains that Mr. Burke was on vacation in another state at the time. Mr. Levy was also accused of lying about conversations he had had with other parole officials about incidents before, during and after Mr. Kim's hearing before the parole panel.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy was appointed to the Parole Board by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo in 1992 and stepped down in 1998. His lawyer, Brian Mumford, was away from his office yesterday and unavailable for comment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy was expected to turn himself in to the authorities later this week. If found guilty of all charges, he faces a maximum of 10 years in federal prison.</p>
