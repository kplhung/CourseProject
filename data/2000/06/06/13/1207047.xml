        <p>The mayor of New Orleans slammed his fist on the lectern, reaching for a passionate note before more than 300 of his fellow mayors. ''We have a crisis in the offing,'' said the mayor, Marc H. Morial.</p>
        <p>The mayor of Long Beach, Calif., Beverly O'Neill, was equally concerned. ''This is the No. 1 problem facing our country,'' Mayor O'Neill said.</p>
        <p>But it was not drugs, crime or other persistent urban ills that was most troubling to the city leaders gathered for this year's annual meeting of the United States Conference of Mayors.</p>
        <p>Instead, to hear the mayors tell it, urban America's biggest challenge of late is prosperity. Compared with past years, the problems of the city are almost happy problems.</p>
        <p>The mayors complained about too many high-skill jobs, and not enough people to fill them; too many well-off people moving back to the city, and not enough houses for all of them, driving up prices for everyone else; and too much demand for parks and serenity, and not enough open space to offer the new city dwellers appalled by sprawl.</p>
        <p>Just as the cities now view themselves as solvent, polished and politically fashionable, they find they are no longer shunned by political leaders who used to consider urban concerns a dead end. Four years ago, Bob Dole, the Republican presidential nominee, would not even address the mayors when they gathered in Cleveland for their annual meeting.</p>
        <p>Today, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who spoke to the mayors by satellite from the family home in Maine, embraced many of their issues, though the overwhelmingly Democratic majority of mayors took issue with him afterward.</p>
        <p>Mayors from both parties agree that the nation's big cities, neglected in the era of suburban concerns, are in the catbird seat.</p>
        <p>''What's changed is the re-urbanization of America,'' said Larry Bartley, Republican mayor of Titusville, Fla., and a supporter of Mr. Bush. ''More and more Americans are moving back to the cities because they like what's going on there.''</p>
        <p>As the president of the Conference of Mayors, Wellington Webb of Denver, said, ''It's our day in the sun, and it's a very bright day because the old image of the American city is gone.''</p>
        <p>''Cities used to have a tin cup out begging for money from Washington,'' Mr. Webb said. ''Now half the cities are worried about what they in Washington are going to do to us.''</p>
        <p>Underscoring the good times were two reports released at the conference, which runs through Tuesday.</p>
        <p>One study, the annual state of the cities report issued by the Clinton administration, made a case that urban areas were ''enjoying the longest and strongest economic expansion in our history,'' in the words of Andrew M. Cuomo, secretary of Housing and Urban Development, which released the report today.</p>
        <p>The other study put the urban economic boom in a global perspective, ranking 47 American metropolitan areas among the top 100 economies in the world. Chicago's gross product is greater than that of Switzerland, and Providence, R. I., ranks above Vietnam, to cite two cases.</p>
        <p>The percentage of American families who own their homes, 67 percent, has never been higher, the study showed. And among urban dwellers, home ownership is also a record, at 51 percent, though still 20 points below the home ownership percentage in the suburbs.</p>
        <p>But the mayors saw a darker side in the reports, which note that not all cities are enjoying renewed vigor. The booming urban economies have transformed places that were in a near-triage situation, but have made it harder for the poor and lower middle-class to live in the cities.</p>
        <p>The urban boom has driven up home prices at twice the rate of inflation, Mr. Cuomo said. In San Francisco, a city where real estate prices have skyrocketed with the surge in new economy jobs, the school system is planning to build rent-subsidized apartments for public school teachers.</p>
        <p>Similarly, Mr. Cuomo said the federal government would have to step up its housing subsidies for the cities that are now pricing out low- and middle-wage job earners.</p>
        <p>Governor Bush, repeating several ideas he has proposed on the campaign trail, called for allowing people who now get subsidized rent to use that money for down payments on their homes. He also advocated tax credits for builders who construct houses to sell below market cost in certain neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>Democrats criticized Mr. Bush for not offering more to the mayors in the form of direct housing subsidies, and for not going further on gun control. But on other, more general, issues, there was more consensus.</p>
        <p>''There's been a big change across the nation,'' said Gov. Brent Coles of Boise, Idaho, a Republican. ''As prosperity has increased, and the cold war disappeared, the issues on the minds of the American people are things like growth, sprawl, parks.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush promised to fully finance a federal program that allocates up to $900 million a year to buy open space near cities, something many Republicans in Congress have been reluctant to do.</p>
        <p>He backed increased educational choices, including vouchers and charter schools, as a way to train future workers. And in a nod to the change in the urban pulse, Mr. Bush noted that cities like ''Pittsburgh and Cleveland have seen a renaissance.''</p>
        <p>Coping with prosperity has even become a problem for cities that were slow to turn around. Approaching its 300th anniversary next year, Detroit has reversed the tide of jobs and people out of the city, said its mayor, Dennis Archer. The city's unemployment rate had fallen to 5 percent, from 16 percent in 1994, Mr. Archer said.</p>
        <p>Providence, like the high tech centers of Seattle or San Francisco or Austin, Tex., has a shortage of skilled workers, and has seen a sudden spike in housing prices, said the city's mayor, Vincent A. Cianci Jr.</p>
        <p>''I've been a mayor in the 70's, 80's and 90's, and it used to be that being a big city mayor meant being a social worker,'' Mr. Cianci said. ''Now mayors are entrepreneurs.''</p>
        <p>''The exodus of years ago has changed,'' he said. ''It's hip living in the cities. People want to be back.''</p>
