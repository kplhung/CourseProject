        <p>Following are excerpts from the Supreme Court's ruling today that a patient cannot use the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to sue a health maintenance organization for giving doctors a financial incentive to cut treatment costs. Justice David H. Souter wrote the opinion for a unanimous court.</p>
        <p>The question in this case is whether treatment decisions made by a health maintenance organization, acting through its physician employees, are fiduciary acts within the meaning of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. . . . We hold that they are not.</p>
        <p>Petitioners, Carle Clinic Association P. C., Health Alliance Medical Plans Inc. and Carle Health Insurance Management Company Inc. (collectively Carle) function as a health maintenance organization (H.M.O.) organized for profit. Its owners are physicians providing prepaid medical services to participants whose employers contract with Carle to provide such coverage. Respondent, Cynthia Herdrich, was covered by Carle through her husband's employer, State Farm Insurance Company.</p>
        <p>Whether Carle is a fiduciary when it acts through its physician owners as pleaded in the Erisa count depends on some background of fact and law about H.M.O. organizations, medical benefit plans, fiduciary obligation and the meaning of Herdrich's allegations.</p>
        <p>Traditionally, medical care in the United States has been provided on a ''fee-for-service'' basis.  A physician charges so much for a general physical exam, a vaccination, a tonsillectomy and so on. The physician bills the patient for services provided or, if there is insurance and the doctor is willing, submits the bill for the patient's care to the insurer, for payment subject to the terms of the insurance agreement. . . . In a fee-for-service system, a physician's financial incentive is to provide more care, not less, so long as payment is forthcoming. The check on this incentive is a physician's obligation to exercise reasonable medical skill and judgment in the patient's interest.</p>
        <p>Like other risk-bearing organizations, H.M.O.'s take steps to control costs. At the least, H.M.O.'s, like traditional insurers, will in some fashion make coverage determinations, scrutinizing requested services against the contractual provisions to make sure that a request for care falls within the scope of covered circumstances (pregnancy, for example), or that a given treatment falls within the scope of the care promised (surgery, for instance). They customarily issue general guidelines for their physicians about appropriate levels of care. . . .</p>
        <p>These cost-controlling measures are commonly complemented by specific financial incentives to physicians, rewarding them for decreasing utilization of health care services, and penalizing them for what may be found to be excessive treatment. . . .</p>
        <p>In general terms, fiduciary responsibility under Erisa is simply stated. The statute provides that fiduciaries shall discharge their duties with respect to a plan ''solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries. . . .''</p>
        <p>Under Erisa, however, a fiduciary may have financial interests adverse to beneficiaries. Employers, for example, can be Erisa fiduciaries and still take actions to the disadvantage of employee beneficiaries, when they act as employers (e.g., firing a beneficiary for reasons unrelated to the Erisa plan), or even as plan sponsors (e.g., modifying the terms of a plan as allowed by Erisa to provide less generous benefits). Nor is there any apparent reason in the Erisa provisions to conclude, as Herdrich argues, that this tension is permissible only for the employer or plan sponsor, to the exclusion of persons who provide services to an Erisa plan.</p>
        <p>Erisa does require, however, that the fiduciary with two hats wear only one at a time, and wear the fiduciary hat when making fiduciary decisions. . . . In every case charging breach of Erisa fiduciary duty, then, the threshold question is not whether the actions of some person employed to provide services under a plan adversely affected a plan beneficiary's interest, but whether that person was acting as a fiduciary (that is, was performing a fiduciary function) when taking the action subject to complaint.</p>
