        <p>You can't say that Peter Huang doesn't put himself on the line for his cause.</p>
        <p>The other day Mr. Huang, a human-rights figure and a self-described ''social-movement person,'' was out on the street with fellow opponents of capital punishment, demanding a new trial for three death-row inmates whose confessions they insist were obtained by torture.</p>
        <p>Mr. Huang made a more dramatic public gesture back in April 1970 on the front steps of the Plaza Hotel in New York. There, in the name of the native Taiwanese movement for civil rights, he tried to assassinate Chiang Ching-kuo -- the son of Chiang Kai-shek who was then taking over from his ailing father as chief of the Nationalist Party dictatorship in Taiwan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Huang was thwarted only by the quick reflexes of a guard, who struck his arm as he fired a .25 caliber Beretta, sending the bullet through the Plaza's revolving glass door. Mr. Huang and an accomplice were convicted in New York of attempted murder, but they jumped bail and fled to Europe.</p>
        <p>A quarter-century later, in 1996, Mr. Huang, also known by his Chinese name Huang Wen-hsiung, resurfaced after he sneaked back into a transformed, democratic Taiwan. He is still fighting charges of illegal entry -- Taiwan's statute of limitations on the assassination attempt has expired -- but in the meantime he has become a respected campaigner for legal and civil rights, which many experts say remain imperfectly protected in Taiwan.</p>
        <p>Now, with the toppling of the Nationalists in elections last March and the inauguration of Chen Shui-bian as president, Taiwan has a national leader who has embraced many of Mr. Huang's ideas. Mr. Chen has even vowed to make human rights, at home and abroad, a key element in his diplomacy.</p>
        <p>After a lifetime as an outsider, Mr. Huang, now 63, seems a bit unsure of how to relate to the friendly new government. While barely containing his satisfaction at the turn of events, he is very quick to point out Taiwan's continuing lapses.</p>
        <p>And he struggles to explain, to others and himself, his own history -- how an opponent of the death penalty could be an assassin.</p>
        <p>''Some people might say there's a contradiction there,'' he allowed in a recent conversation. ''But I don't think that's true.''</p>
        <p>''If you look at the record of the abolitionists, most of them were soldiers at one time,'' he said, comparing himself to the 19th century anti-slavery activists and noting that the man he tried to kill had, among other things, directed the murderous secret police. ''Had I been a citizen of a more democratic society I wouldn't have imagined doing something like that.''</p>
        <p>Democracy came to Taiwan in steps during the last two decades, eventually nurtured by Mr. Chiang, the lucky survivor of the Plaza incident, himself. Last month, in a kind of culmination of Taiwan's democratic transition, the island had its first transfer of presidential power to an opposition candidate.</p>
        <p>President Chen, in his inaugural speech on May 20, pledged to adopt international treaties on human rights and carry out their provisions at home even if, as a diplomatic outcast since Beijing took over the China seat in the United Nations from Taipei, Taiwan is not allowed formally to join. Mr. Chen proposed setting up a national human-rights watchdog commission and cultivating relations with private and inter-governmental rights groups abroad.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chen's foreign minister speaks of a new ''human rights diplomacy'' -- using such initiatives to multiply Taiwan's global contacts and, not coincidentally, sharpen perceptions of the difference between this free-speaking island and the Communist-ruled mainland that claims sovereignty over it.</p>
        <p>The strategy seems like an obvious one for Taiwan, which is struggling against the severe diplomatic isolation imposed by Beijing and whose scrappy democracy has gained admiration around the world.  And the strategy has credibility when put forth by Mr. Chen, 49, who himself battled for democratic rights in the waning years of the Nationalist dictatorship.</p>
        <p>Whereas the Nationalists have recently seemed stuck in the past -- they expended enormous energy and funds courting ultra-conservative newspapers and politicians abroad -- Mr. Chen hopes, with the new strategy, to attract strong new support from a different group of politically more liberal people and countries.</p>
        <p>Mr. Huang has mixed feelings about this diplomatic focus. ''My first goal is to improve human rights conditions here in Taiwan,'' he said. ''If we also get international benefits as a result, so much the better.''</p>
        <p>''Compared with some countries, conditions aren't that bad,'' he acknowledged, noting that the freedoms of speech and association seemed relatively secure. But in other areas, such as the rights of criminal suspects or the political use of legal and tax powers, abuses continue, he and others say.</p>
        <p>In conversation, Mr. Huang circles back to his desperate, defining act in 1970. He described going to the United States as a student in the mid-1960's and becoming enveloped by the sheer ferment of the era, including the antiwar and civil rights movements.</p>
        <p>''The contrast with conditions in Taiwan was really surreal,'' he said, recalling an island where books were banned and dissidents were imprisoned.</p>
        <p>Mr. Huang attended the University of Pittsburgh and then, at the time of the shooting, was a graduate student in sociology at Cornell. Once in the United States he quickly joined in the so-called Taiwan independence movement, which was as much about overthrowing the Nationalist dictatorship, dominated by mainlanders who had fled to Taiwan after the Chinese civil war, as about Taiwan's status vis-a-vis the mainland.</p>
        <p>Many Taiwanese students in the United States were interested in eliminating Chiang Ching-kuo, he said. One group of engineering students devised elaborate plots using bombs or long-distance marksmanship, but other students, including Mr. Huang, disagreed.</p>
        <p>''We decided it should be a political act, done openly, and that we should not hurt the innocent,'' he said. ''So the only way was to get as close as possible to him.''</p>
        <p>Today, citing his precarious legal status -- apart from his troubles with Taiwan authorities, he assumes he is still wanted for sentencing in New York -- Mr. Huang refuses to discuss the quarter century he spent on the run, saying only that he led a fairly normal life and was involved in ''various movement causes.''</p>
        <p>''I won't try to defend myself,'' he finally said of the assassination attempt. ''I only ask that people who judge me use the same standards in judging Chiang Ching-kuo.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Chiang's international reputation has soared since his death in 1988 because in his later years, under pressure from the restive native-Taiwanese majority and from Taiwan's American patrons, he loosened up the dictatorship and paved the way for free elections.</p>
        <p>Mr. Huang, not surprisingly, is less generous than many are with praise of the late strongman.</p>
        <p>''A less intelligent dictator would probably have tried to suppress the Taiwanese at any cost,'' he said. ''But remember, it's as though he put out a fire that he had helped to light.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Huang has just stepped down as chairman of the Taiwan Association for Human Rights but remains on the board, and says he plans to write his memoirs.</p>
        <p>On meeting this reporter, Mr. Huang revealed just how potent a memory he keeps of that frenzied day in 1970.</p>
        <p>''The report in The New York Times had a mistake,'' he said immediately. ''The article said that I wore beads when I was arrested.''</p>
        <p>''That's not true,'' he said. ''I was more a Bohemian than a hippie, and that description of me in beads gave the wrong impression.''</p>
