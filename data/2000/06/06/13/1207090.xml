        <p>In his heart, Bobby J. Jones believes he has not pitched as poorly as his record suggests. In his head, the Mets' right-hander is confounded by his continuing struggles. Yesterday, he accepted a demotion to Class AAA Norfolk with the promise that he would return to the Mets' rotation on June 23.</p>
        <p>''You pitch in the major leagues for seven seasons and all of a sudden things go bad for you,'' Jones said yesterday. ''There's been a lot of restless times and a lot of sleepless nights trying to figure out exactly what's going on. But sometimes you have to swallow your pride and figure out what's best.''</p>
        <p>The Mets yesterday began an eight-day stretch in which they have three days off. Jones, who is 1-3 with a 10.19 earned run average in eight starts, met with General Manager Steve Phillips, Manager Bobby Valentine and the pitching coach Dave Wallace at Yankee Stadium during Sunday's rain delay and was told the Mets wanted him to get regular work at Norfolk instead of shifting to the bullpen.</p>
        <p>Because he has more than five years in the majors, Jones could have refused the assignment and become a free agent. But after he starts in Norfolk tomorrow and Sunday, Phillips said, Jones will ''absolutely'' return to the Mets to face Pittsburgh at Shea Stadium the following Friday.</p>
        <p>Jones, who missed most of last season with bursitis in his pitching shoulder and spent a month on the disabled list this year with a calf strain, said he would continue to work on his curveball, which showed improvement on Saturday despite a 13-5 loss to the Yankees.</p>
        <p>The left-hander Bobby M. Jones, who was 6-3 with a 4.18 E.R.A. at Norfolk, was promoted to the Mets. He will be used in long relief for the next eight games and then will probably return to Norfolk, Phillips said.</p>
        <p>Jones began the season as the Mets' No. 4 starter and was considered by some in the organization to be pivotal to the team's fortunes this year. The emergence of Glendon Rusch has lessened the impact of Jones's ineffectiveness, but the Mets are still seeking help for their rotation, and that is why they may not be aggressive in pursuit of Sammy Sosa, whose Chicago Cubs are host to the Mets tonight at Wrigley Field.</p>
        <p>''We'll be open to deals large and small and consider all of them and how they will impact our organization,'' Phillips said yesterday. ''It's just a wait-and-see as to who's available and what the cost is.''</p>
        <p>Sosa could help the Mets, and because his team needs an outfielder, Phillips is obligated to investigate the possibility. He contacted Cubs General Manager Ed Lynch last Friday and was told Sosa was available. The clubs have not spoken since.</p>
        <p>But the sense around the team is that pitching and a left-handed hitter are the Mets' more pressing needs.</p>
        <p>The pitching market could be thin this summer. Veteran starters with losing records in the last year of their contracts -- Philadelphia's Andy Ashby, Detroit's Hideo Nomo, Tampa Bay's Steve Trachsel -- may be dealt by the July 31 trading deadline. Unless he is signed to an extension, Minnesota's Brad Radke, who is 3-8 but has pitched well, might be the best arm available. The Mets are also seeking bullpen help.</p>
        <p>Although the Mets hit left-handed pitchers well, and will soon have Darryl Hamilton back from a toe injury, their preference is still to add a dependable left-handed bat. Kansas City's Johnny Damon, a proven leadoff hitter, is attractive to the Mets and could be available in a deal.</p>
        <p>Then there is Seattle shortstop Alex Rodriguez, who will not be traded this year but can be a free agent after the season. If the Mets acquired Sosa and signed him to a long-term contract -- and Sosa could command a salary near $20 million a season for five or six years, which the Cubs appear unwilling to give -- it would take not only their best prospects but also the money they could apply to a Rodriguez bid.</p>
        <p>If the Mets acquired Sosa, he would join Derek Bell, John Franco, Mike Hampton, Rick Reed and Turk Wendell as potential free agents with significant roles on the team. The perception that the Mets are trying to win at all costs this year -- at least in part so the contracts of Phillips and Manager Bobby Valentine can be renewed -- would be reinforced.</p>
        <p>''In New York, unless you're in a rebuilding mode, your goal is to go for it every year,'' Phillips said. ''I don't look at this year as any different from last year or the year before. My job description hasn't changed even though I'm in the last year of my contract. I make decisions with the intent of trying to help us win in the short term and with thought to maintaining a high level of competitiveness for the future.''</p>
