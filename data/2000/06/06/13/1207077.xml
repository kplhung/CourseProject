        <p>Chuck Knoblauch was already late for an indoor batting practice session yesterday, but he did not budge from in front of his locker. He was discussing attributes like character and integrity, and he wanted to be as emphatic as possible in describing his feelings.</p>
        <p>Knoblauch was angry about an article in The Daily News last Sunday that said George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, and several members of the team's hierarchy thought Knoblauch, who has been plagued by a sore left forearm, should have been back in the lineup sooner. The 31-year-old second baseman was expected to start last night for the first time since June 4, but the game between the Yankees and the Red Sox was rained out.</p>
        <p>The article did not contain a quotation from Steinbrenner or any other Yankee officials, but Knoblauch was still confused and bothered by it. Knoblauch, who has averaged 150 games played in his first two years with the Yankees, stressed that the article bothered him because it attacked him blindly. He initially said that Steinbrenner could ''do whatever he wants'' before realizing that Steinbrenner had not been quoted in the story.</p>
        <p>''That's ridiculous,'' Knoblauch said. ''You make a statement like that and you're questioning my character and my integrity. I've played long enough to have a track record of playing as many games as possible and playing hurt.''</p>
        <p>When Manager Joe Torre spotted the article on Sunday, he immediately went to Knoblauch and assured him that he should not be worried about it. Torre told Knoblauch to ignore everything, unless the remarks were from Torre.</p>
        <p>''It disturbed me,'' Torre said. ''I wanted to make sure that Chuck knew that his only concern should be with me. That stuff is not important. I didn't want him to all of a sudden say I'm playing just because he felt pressured into it.''</p>
        <p>While Torre said nobody in the organization had said anything to him directly about Knoblauch's being reluctant to play, the manager added that in the world of the Yankees, ''you hear people banter back and forth.'' Still, Torre explained how a player ''can't hide forever'' and said it made ''no sense at all'' for anyone to charge Knoblauch with faking the seriousness of his injury.</p>
        <p>''He plays hard all the time,'' Torre said. ''He's a tough, hard-nosed player. This is something he could probably play with. Who knows how effective he would be? There's no question if it was September, he'd be playing.''</p>
        <p>Because Knoblauch has had daily discussions with Torre and General Manager Brian Cashman about his condition, he was surprised there was speculation that he did not want to play. During his 10-year career, Knoblauch has never been on the disabled list. If Steinbrenner were perturbed with Knoblauch, Knoblauch said, the owner ''would say it to me, if he was going to say it.''</p>
        <p>Knoblauch, who hinted at retirement last month because he was exasperated over his chronic throwing problems, has not shied away from playing even as his inconsistent throws received growing scrutiny. After Minnesota's Corey Koskie roll-blocked Knoblauch on May 6, 1999, and the Yankees feared he might be lost for several months, he was back in less than a week.</p>
        <p>''The perfect example is Joe saying there's a difference between playing hurt and playing stupid,'' Knoblauch said. ''If it gets to a point where you can't go, you can't go. I was pretty ticked off about the question. That's one of the worst things you can do to somebody is question their character or integrity.''</p>
        <p>Torre said he trusted Knoblauch after managing him for almost two and a half years and was certain the leadoff batter would not milk an injury to get more days off.</p>
        <p>''It's not like it's his first year,'' said Torre. ''It's his third year with us. Even if he throws the ball away, what the heck is the difference? He's done it. And how have we done? We've won two years in a row.''</p>
        <p>Knoblauch received a cortisone shot last Thursday and felt healthy enough to return last night before the rain intervened. Knoblauch hopes that the mysterious injury will not hamper him anymore and that he never again has to defend his desire to play.</p>
        <p>''I'm not going to make it a concern of mine,'' Knoblauch said. ''It was never said to my face. Whoever it is coming from is kind of a ghost.''</p>
