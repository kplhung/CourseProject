        <p>MAYBE it was because he saw his share of gang wars growing up in the Bronx, Ralph J. Anthanio said yesterday. That's what the psychologists told him, anyway.</p>
        <p>''They said it probably prepared me better for the violence,'' said Mr. Anthanio, 52, a motorman for most of his 18 years in the New York City subways.</p>
        <p>Whatever the reason, he found it easy to keep his emotions in check the first couple of times that he had a 12-9. Twelve-nine, in transit lingo, is a radio alert that someone has landed under a subway train.</p>
        <p>The first two times people were killed by trains he operated, in 1987 and 1988, Mr. Anthanio was more irritated than distraught.</p>
        <p>It was their own fault, you might even say foolishness, that landed them on the tracks in the first place, he said. One man was drunk and, for some bizarre reason, had climbed down from the platform to relieve himself. The other fellow turned out to have been on drugs. He jumped to the tracks during a fight with some men at the Times Square IRT station.</p>
        <p>Though it may sound cold, Mr. Anthanio's thoughts at the time turned mainly to his own troubles -- to the inevitable blood-alcohol tests, investigations and paperwork that his superiors would put him through.</p>
        <p>His third 12-9, in March 1989, was quite different.</p>
        <p>That one made all the newspapers. Two fellow subway workers died. They were repairmen who were walking along the tracks near the Astor Place station on the Lexington Avenue line, and didn't hear him coming. Mr. Anthanio didn't see them until it was too late. He still remembers how ''they both looked over their shoulders and realized this train was bearing down on them.''</p>
        <p>''The look on their faces -- it was like looking into a mask of horror,'' he said.</p>
        <p>That time, his blood pressure went sky high. His nerves were shot, and he needed nearly a year and a half to pull himself together. ''I felt all kinds of guilt,'' he recalled yesterday as his shift ended at the 148th Street terminal of the No. 3 line in Harlem.</p>
        <p>''This wasn't some homeless person,'' he said. ''This wasn't someone who was deranged or on drugs. This was two guys trying to do their job. It was a very distressing time for me. I didn't want to see a train after that. Forget driving one. I didn't want to see one.''</p>
        <p>THREE deadly episodes may seem like a lot for one man. But it is not unheard of, transit officials say, and Mr. Anthanio adds, ''12-9's happen on a very regular basis.''</p>
        <p>For sure, subway safety is on the minds of many New Yorkers after a burst of platform pushings. Leaving the occasional pushing death aside, subway officials say that 226 people -- including suicides, homeless New Yorkers in tunnels and riders who accidentally tumbled onto the tracks -- were killed by trains from January 1995 to last month.</p>
        <p>That averages out to more than three deaths a month. While the victims naturally draw the greatest attention, the toll is also borne by the motormen, who are often guilty of nothing more than being in the wrong place when fortune chooses to take time off.</p>
        <p>The best-known incident of recent vintage, the pushing death of Kendra Webdale last year, is said to have left that motorman profoundly shocked. It took him a long time to get back to work, transit officials say.</p>
        <p>More typically, motormen return after taking off a required three days, said Dr. Michelle Alexander, who is in charge of the transit agency's Occupational Health Services. But anything is possible. ''Some people take months, some days,'' Dr. Alexander said. ''Some don't go back at all.''</p>
        <p>When it comes to bouncing back, Mr. Anthanio knows both the long and the short of it. After the 1989 incident, he said, he was absolved of wrongdoing, but his supervisors questioned whether he remained psychologically fit for the job. He fought them, and prevailed.</p>
        <p>Even so, he was ''a little tentative'' when he first returned, said Mr. Anthanio, a large man who goes by the nickname Heavy. ''The first time I went down the road by myself, I got in the cab and said, 'Yo, Heavy, ain't nothin' to it but to do it.' I just went ahead from there.''</p>
        <p>These days, he has given up passenger runs in favor of ''yard-switching,'' preparing trains to go into service. Yet all it takes is something like the Webdale horror to reawaken those old demons.</p>
        <p>''Every time you hear about a 12-9, it comes up again,'' he said. ''You never get over it.''</p>
