        <p>In two games last weekend, Doug Collins and Tim McCarver proved why they are among the best analysts in sports. In a third, Bill Clement showed why ABC should have chosen John Davidson to call the Stanley Cup, not stick him in a studio.</p>
        <p>NBC's Collins is not a wit and he speaks too quickly, but Game 3 of the National Basketball Association finals on Sunday showcased his analytic dexterity and urgency.</p>
        <p>''If Rik Smits is discouraged with Rik Smits, he should sit down,'' Collins said of the Indiana Pacers' center, who seems to play in cement shoes.</p>
        <p>Collins noted with alacrity how Indiana switched to a new scheme of baseline screens against the Los Angeles Lakers to spring Reggie Miller for jump shots; explained with admiration the way Laker forward Robert Horry needed only one dribble from the 3-point line for a dunk; counted the 26 dribbles Travis Best employed over 19 seconds to bore his inert Pacer teammates; and castigated Smits and the Lakers' Rick Fox for committing stupid fouls.</p>
        <p>Collins questioned Coach Phil Jackson of the Lakers for benching Glen Rice for most of the second half (''he's supposed to be the second option'') and adroitly described that the way to defend Shaquille O'Neal is to face him ''rather than try to rebound,'' a difficult task because ''it's against your instincts.'' (If in need of a second analyst, NBC should hire John Wooden, a mere 89, who said in a halftime interview Sunday that O'Neal would improve by dieting.)</p>
        <p>But Collins saved his passion for Miller. One wonders if Miller, who hit a field-goal drought on Sunday, heard Collins chiding and riding him with calls of ''Where is Reggie Miller?'' and ''Reggie, this is your time, you said you'd attack!''</p>
        <p>McCarver's work for Fox on Saturday's Mets-Yankees game accentuated his strengths. No one anticipates plays better.</p>
        <p>He scorned Met left fielder Jason Tyner for bunting with runners on first and second with one out. ''What he's saying is, 'Let the next guy do it,' '' McCarver said. He questioned Manager Bobby Valentine of the Mets for leaving in his struggling starter, Bobby J. Jones, with the score tied in the fifth inning, and reproved Yankee second baseman Wilson Delgado for not sliding on a force play. ''He even pulled up,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He avoided bad puns, but introduced a new term into his lexicon: the antiperspirant fastball -- a high heater that forces a batter to jerk his arms up as if he is in dire need of a swipe of Right Guard.</p>
        <p>What makes McCarver better on Fox than he is with Bobby Murcer on local Yankee games on Channel 5 is his partner, the terrific Joe Buck. McCarver connected Tyner to Ralph Kiner and ''Kiner's Korner,'' prompted Buck to ask McCarver if he had ever been on the recently revived chatfest.</p>
        <p>''Yeah, the $50, man,'' McCarver said, recalling when that was a generous gift to be a guest of Kiner's. Buck then related how his father, Jack, with whom he calls Cardinals games, had run out of gifts to give players after they'd been interviewed, so he handed the multimillionaire pitcher Greg Maddux $50.</p>
        <p>''Maddux took it and put in his pocket,'' the younger Buck said.</p>
        <p>No major sport leaves less room for an analyst than hockey. Gary Thorne's play-by-play dominated ABC's Stanley Cup broadcasts, leaving Clement to squeeze his analysis into short doses. When Clement was called upon, his remarks were more pedestrian than significant. Davidson and Barry Melrose were more trenchant during the intermissions.</p>
        <p>Much analyst talk is a verbal crapshoot. Early in Game 6 of the Stanley Cup finals on Saturday night, Clement suggested that Dallas held the emotional edge over the Devils, who missed many chances to win Game 5. He turned out to be wrong. The Devils' physical play belied any pregame anxiety.</p>
        <p>When Derian Hatcher of Dallas leveled Petr Sykora of the Devils in the first period with an elbow, Clement excused the absence of a penalty call. ''Sykora was crouching, so it's hard to say if the elbow was intentional,'' he said. Later, at intermission, Davidson said bluntly, ''The elbow was up and it should have been a major penalty.'' He said that when Hatcher saw the Devils' manhandling of Joe Nieuwendyk and Darryl Sydor ''he had to come out and be one big mean guy.''</p>
        <p>Musical Play List</p>
        <p>On Saturday Fox enlivened its weekly baseball ''Fan of the Game'' feature with a snippet of ''Too Darn Hot,'' from ''Kiss Me, Kate.'' Fox also employed the theme song from ''The Sopranos'' in a humorous opening vignette to the game; leading into the Mets-Yankees game on Sunday, ESPN disappointingly used the trite ''New York, New York.''</p>
        <p>But for about as long as NBC has carried the N.B.A., its theme music has been unchanged. You hear it when NBC heads to a commercial and usually when it returns. Twenty or 30 times a game. Its time is gone. Hearing it is as annoying as the blaring rock music must have sounded to the former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega when United States forces invaded his country.</p>
        <p>Airwaves</p>
        <p>Fox Sports Net is promoting its new 11 p.m. Regional Sports Report -- which begins rolling out tomorrow -- with a meanspirited promotional campaign that makes Russians, Indians, Turks and Chinese look like morons. Give me the ESPN ''This is SportsCenter'' spots where athletes and anchors lightheartedly mock their images. . . . NBC's national Nielsen rating for the first two games of the N.B.A. finals is down 4 percent to a 10.2. One rating point represents about 1.01 million households. The overnight rating for Game 3 rose 4.8 percent to a 13.0. . . . NBC's French Open overnight rating plunged to a 2.5 Sunday from a 4.0 last year.</p>
