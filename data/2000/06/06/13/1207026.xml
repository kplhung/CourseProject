        <p>With $60 billion in potential business from an antimissile defense system, it would seem that the nation's military contractors would be using their well-honed lobbying skills to push hard in the corridors of power here.</p>
        <p>Instead, they are strangely invisible. They are not making phone calls to lawmakers. They are not cornering crucial members of the Armed Services Committees. They are barely making a ripple in the debate over the proposed missile system, a legacy of the Reagan-era Strategic Defense Initiative to shoot down missiles as they travel through space.</p>
        <p>''There is no point in lobbying for something that doesn't need to be lobbied,'' a lobbyist for a major contractor said. ''We don't have to do much to encourage it to happen.''</p>
        <p>But the contractors have been anything but absent from the debate. If they are not lobbying now, that is because they feel that they have already done their work and do not want to jinx it.</p>
        <p>Over the last decade, the arms industry has spent $49 million in campaign contributions to Washington politicians and an additional $2 million in a more subtle and indirect campaign that they say has helped create an atmosphere in which the pressure to build an antimissile system weights heavily on both parties.</p>
        <p>Several big weapons builders have financed research centers and used them to shape the debate. The effort has produced a flood of so-called issue advertising that is being broadcast here. Some of the money is disclosed, some is not.</p>
        <p>Leading the charge for missile defense is the Center for Security Policy, a group that has relied on military contractors for 20 to 35 percent of its annual budget, which is $1.2 million. Dedicated to having an antimissile system built, the center has at least eight industry representatives on its board -- six from Lockheed Martin alone -- and issues a steady stream of position papers and sponsors numerous seminars for Washington decision makers.</p>
        <p>''From our inception, our organization has been a champion of national missile defense,'' said Frank J. Gaffney Jr., president of the group and a Pentagon official in the Reagan administration. In and out of government, Mr. Gaffney has long been the high priest of the Reagan missile-defense vision.</p>
        <p>''We've done that,'' he said, ''because the people associated with this organization like me have spent our lives working for national missile defense.''</p>
        <p>Since its start in 1988, military contractors have supported the center, giving it more than $2 million. Among them are Boeing, the prime contractor on the project, and the main subcontractors, Lockheed Martin and TRW. Other contractors who have contributed are General Dynamics, Rockwell International and Northrop Grumman. The contributions are tax deductible, meaning that the government, indirectly, bears some of the cost.</p>
        <p>In a one-month period this spring, the center issued many statements called ''decision briefs'' with titles like ''Missile Defense: Cheap at Twice the Price,'' ''Protect Americans NOW'' and ''It's Time to Defend America.''</p>
        <p>On the 10th anniversary of President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative speech of 1983, the center issued a paper saying, ''We cannot afford to bet that another anniversary of President Reagan's S.D.I. speech can be safely observed without a deployed antimissile system. Americans need to be protected now, and they can be.''</p>
        <p>A senior fellow at the World Policy Institute of the New School in New York, William Hartung, said: ''The center has been the most vocal in a chorus of think tanks pushing for national missile defense. Among the biggest contributors to the center is the military industry. If they can keep the center afloat, the center can do a better job of pushing the program.''</p>
        <p>To that end, the center uses its money to brief important members of Congress and it offers a daily running commentary for editorial writers and anyone interested in the issue. In addition, staunch Republican supporters of missile defense like Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona and Representative Curt Weldon of Pennsylvania, both Republicans, are on the center's board.</p>
        <p>The center draws attention to those it considers friends. It gave its Keeper of the Flame award in 1998 to former Defense Secretary Donald M. Rumsfeld, head of a government commission that outlined the potential threat of a North Korean missile attack and provided the military justification for national missile defense. Other award winners were Ronald Reagan and Newt Gingrich.</p>
        <p>''It's no accident the Republican leadership is seized with the idea of national missile defense,'' Mr. Gaffney said. ''It's a function of a lot of serious spade work and a lot of education from groups like ours.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gaffney is also spearheading the Coalition to Protect Americans Now, a group that is paying for television commercials here to promote missile defense and attack the Clinton administration for proposing a system that is too limited. The ad show babies in cribs and children playing baseball interspersed with photos of missiles raining down on the United States. As it is shown, an announcer asks, ''Where will you be when the missiles are launched?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gaffney will not say who is paying for the ads or how much they cost.</p>
        <p>There are many reasons why military contractors prefer to take a back-door approach on missile defense. In part, the problem stems from the sensitivity of the issue. No contractor wants to be seen advocating a defensive program that could be seen as violating the Antiballistic Missile Treaty of 1972.</p>
        <p>No contractor wants to become engaged in a battle that many see, at this moment, as more political than an issue of national security. No contractor wants to lobby a program where the slightest political misstep could put them at odds with powerful elements in the White House, Congress, the Pentagon or all three.</p>
        <p>''In our view, this is a politically charged program,'' said David Shea, a spokesman for Raytheon. ''And it is appropriate for the government to deal with these questions, not us.''</p>
        <p>If contractors push too hard, they could alienate a reluctant White House. If they push too softly, they could alienate a Republican leadership that is hungering for the program. And, if the contractors become too associated with missile defense, they could be seen as putting profits ahead of arms reduction.</p>
        <p>Besides, with some Republican leaders so solidly behind the program, many contractors feel that they could better spend their time lobbying for programs with less political support. That is especially true now that the administration has given limited support to the plan, as well.</p>
        <p>''The White House and Congress are doing all the lobbying for them,'' said Jon B. Kutler, president of Quarterdeck Investment Partners, an investment concern in Los Angeles that specializes in military companies. ''The contractors are saving their gunpowder for other challenges.''</p>
        <p>A missile defense system has long been a article of faith among Republican conservatives. It is the sole weapons system in the Contract With America. To make sure that backers of missile defense were elected, the industry has given generously to Republicans, by a 2-to-1 margin over Democrats.</p>
        <p>In 1999, the industry gave the Republican Party and candidates $4.2 million in soft money, the large unrestricted donations to the parties, and in direct donations. That compares with $2.5 million to Democrats, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a research group here. In the 1998 midterm elections, Republicans received $7.3 million, compared to $3.4 million for Democrats.</p>
        <p>On the Democratic side, the contractors have Bernard L. Schwartz, chief executive of Loral Space and Communications. An active Democrat who is close to the administration, Mr. Schwartz gave Democrats more than $1 million in the 1996 elections and has given $285,000 in this election.</p>
        <p>Besides politics, there are also some business-related reasons for the contractors to steer clear of lobbying. For one, the amount of money that the companies receive from the program is small by their standards. As prime contractor, Boeing receives a $1.6 billion three-year contract to oversee project development. It shares that with other major team members, Raytheon, maker of the ''kill vehicle,'' the interceptor missile; TRW, designer of the communications system; and Lockheed Martin, maker of the launch vehicle.</p>
        <p>Although $1.6 billion might sound large, it is small in comparison to the companies' overall revenues. Boeing had $57.9 billion in 1999 and Lockheed Martin totaled $25.5 billion. Moreover, because missile defense continues to be more theoretical than real, it provides little to the contractors in the way of revenues or jobs. More important to their bottom line is prosaic military equipment like fighter jets, submarines and tanks, which have production lines that employ thousands and that are highly profitable.</p>
        <p>''National missile defense doesn't create that many jobs,'' said Lawrence J. Korb, an analyst of the weapons industry for the Council of Foreign Relations. ''It just uses your scientists to develop the technology. It's not like putting together an airplane. That's where the big money is.''</p>
        <p>As a result, contractors prefer to concentrate greater lobbying resources on protecting the bread-and-butter programs. In addition, with limited dollars available for all military procurement -- the Pentagon's budget for military hardware is $60 billion -- contractors fear that dollars spent on missile defense could come at the expense of other programs with more immediate payoffs. Lockheed and Boeing are concerned about keeping the F-22 contract going. Lockheed wants more money for F-16's, and Boeing wants make sure that there is ample money for its new airborne laser program.</p>
        <p>There has been a steady stream of money flowing to contractors as the Pentagon has over the years experimented with different missile technologies. Since 1983, according to the Pentagon Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, $56 billion has been spent on that research and development.</p>
        <p>''There are people who have spent most of their professional lives pursuing missile defense,'' said Loren Thompson, a military analyst at the Lexington Institute, a research group in Arlington, Va.</p>
        <p>The real payoff, of course, would arrive if the defense is constructed in a way that fulfills the Reagan-era vision.</p>
        <p>Howard A. Rubel, an industry analyst with the Wall Street firm of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, said, ''Anything that begins with $10 billion and goes from there is important.''</p>
