        <p>What's white on the pope, scarlet on a cardinal, violet on a bishop and can be found stamped with an array of  team logos or cartoon characters when found on the heads of Orthodox Jewish boys across New York City?</p>
        <p>The answer, of course, is a skullcap -- zucchetto in Italian, kipa in Hebrew or yarmulke in Yiddish. But at a news conference today, the word in English somehow eluded Bishop Edward M. Egan, who next week will switch hats, so to speak, and become the Roman Catholic archbishop of New York.</p>
        <p>''I was all dolled up and ready to take on the world and I noticed that all of the ushers had on white beanies,'' the bishop said, recounting a visit to a Stamford synagogue. ''I said: 'Rabbi, you are trying to intimidate me. The only one that I know that wears a white beanie is John Paul II.' ''</p>
        <p>The bishop offered the anecdote as evidence of his strong interfaith relationships. But his use of the word beanie prompted him and his aides to worry afterward that in the nation's media capital, where parsing words is a favored pastime, Jewish listeners might get the wrong idea and that the news conference, intended as an adieu to the Connecticut news media, would prompt controversy. ''The bishop felt that perhaps he misspoke, thinking simply about the zucchetto and seeking to translate that,'' Tom Drohan, the spokesman for the Bridgeport Diocese, said later when asked about it. ''It was a translation from the Italian.''</p>
        <p>From the reaction in Jewish quarters, the fears seemed unwarranted. ''I don't find that offensive,'' said Abraham Foxman, the national director of the Anti-Defamation League. ''I don't think the community will find it offensive. I am sure that after a couple of months in New York, he'll learn also to refer to them as skullcaps.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Foxman recalled that Bishop Egan's predecessor, Cardinal John J. O'Connor, was so comfortable among Jews that at speaking engagements he would often tease those who did not wear yarmulkes. ''Here I am in this Jewish audience, the only one with my head covered,'' the cardinal would say.</p>
        <p>And Rabbi Joseph H. Ehrenkranz, the former leader of Congregation Agudath Sholom in Stamford, said he remembered the day Bishop Egan visited and made the joke about the white skullcaps. ''It is a beanie,'' Rabbi Ehrenkranz said. ''Beanie is a correct reference to it. It accurately describes what it is. We wear something on our head to remind us that there is a God over our heads. What you call it makes no difference.''</p>
        <p>Otherwise, in his hourlong news conference, Bishop Egan stayed perfectly on-message, saying he would make the recruitment of new priests a top priority in New York and that he would spend the summer learning about the archdiocese, and declining to discuss lingering lawsuits over alleged sexual abuse by priests.</p>
        <p>As for when he will trade his violet zucchetto for the scarlet of a cardinal, he told a reporter: ''My suggestion would be that you contact a man by the name of Karol Wojtyla. He is also known as Pope John Paul II.''</p>
