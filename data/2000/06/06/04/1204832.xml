        <p>In his eight years in Congress, Representative Rick A. Lazio has regularly broken Republican Party ranks and supported President Clinton on matters like gun control, affirmative action and changes in campaign finance laws.</p>
        <p>But on the big tax and spending questions that have broken along party lines and have often been decided by the narrowest of margins, he has been a reliable ally of the conservative Republican leaders of the House -- so much so that he has been rewarded with leadership positions himself and plum committee assignments.</p>
        <p>He also voted to impeach President Clinton on two of the four articles recommended by the House Judiciary Committee.</p>
        <p>On the question of abortion, which Hillary Rodham Clinton, his Democratic opponent in the race for the Senate from New York, wants to make a central issue, Mr. Lazio has taken a middle ground, siding neither with those who want to outlaw abortion entirely nor those who oppose all abortion restrictions.</p>
        <p>His most important legislative accomplishment has been the enactment in 1998 of legislation he sponsored to overhaul the nation's public housing system. This year, he was instrumental in brokering a compromise to increase the minimum wage.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio has not been particularly involved in foreign policy, but he has been among the House Republicans most supportive of the president on international issues. For example, he supported the president's intervention in Kosovo last year.</p>
        <p>When he announced his candidacy for the Senate last month, Mr. Lazio said: ''I have a record that I am proud of. It is a mainstream record.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's campaign responded with the charge that far from being a moderate, the congressman was a loyal soldier in House Speaker Newt Gingrich's conservative revolution.</p>
        <p>A review of Mr. Lazio's record found ample support for both arguments. In his first two years in Congress, when Democrats were in control, Mr. Lazio voted in favor of the Clinton administration's legislation more often than almost any other Republican. For instance, a study by Congressional Quarterly found that in 1994, Mr. Lazio supported the president on 72 percent of the votes on which Mr. Clinton took a position, a higher percentage than all but two other Republicans in the House.</p>
        <p>But after Republicans won control of the House in the 1994 elections, Mr. Lazio became a strong advocate of most of the items in the Contract with America, the party's election manifesto. Since then, he has been much less supportive of the president.</p>
        <p>Here are some of the issues on which Mr. Lazio has broken with the leaders of his party and voted the way Mrs. Clinton might have voted:</p>
        <p>*Gun control. He voted for the Brady law, which requires a five-day waiting period for handgun purchases, and for a ban on the sale of assault weapons. Last year, he supported a measure to require criminal background checks of people who make purchases at gun shows. (After that was defeated, he supported a watered-down bill endorsed by the National Rifle Association.)</p>
        <p>*Affirmative action. He voted against a bill that would have prohibited colleges and universities from using racial preferences in admissions.</p>
        <p>*Family leave. He supported legislation that requires many companies to give their workers unpaid leave to spend time with a newborn child or a sick family member.</p>
        <p>*Environment. He voted against Republican bills to relax clean water regulations, strip the Environmental Protection Agency of enforcement power and help developers get zoning changes over the objection of environmentalists. (On the other hand, the Republican budget he supported in 1995 included many items opposed by environmentalists, including one that would have allowed oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.)</p>
        <p>*Arts. He was one of only 15 Republicans who bucked the party leadership and voted for full funding for the National Endowment for the Arts.</p>
        <p>*Food stamps. He voted to restore food stamps to legal immigrants, a benefit that had been denied by the 1996 welfare bill.</p>
        <p>*Campaign finance. He has voted for legislation that would ban donations of largely unregulated soft money to political parties and restrict the ability of parties to run issue advertisements on behalf of candidates.</p>
        <p>*Striker replacement. He voted to prohibit employers from hiring permanent replacements for striking workers.</p>
        <p>But when it has come to budget issues, the main focus of the dispute between President Clinton and the Republican Congress over the last six years, Mr. Lazio has toed the party line.</p>
        <p>He was a member of the Budget Committee in 1995 that produced the measure with almost $200 billion in tax cuts over five years, the abolition of the Department of Education and sharp reductions in anticipated government spending for Medicare and many other popular programs. Ultimately, the fight with President Clinton over this budget led to the shutdown of the government in the winter of 1995-96.</p>
        <p>When his committee adopted the Republican budget in May 1995, Mr. Lazio issued a press release proclaiming that it would ''move us from the path of increasing debt and inefficient, big, centralized government toward a government that is smaller, more decentralized and efficient.''</p>
        <p>Over the years, Mr. Lazio voted for a constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget, billions more than President Clinton sought in military spending and sweeping tax cuts.</p>
        <p>These are some of the nonbudget issues on which Mrs. Clinton may challenge Mr. Lazio during the campaign:</p>
        <p>*Gay rights. He voted to codify the ban on homosexuals in the military.</p>
        <p>*Term limits. He supported a constitutional amendment that would have placed a 12-year limit on the terms of senators and representatives.</p>
        <p>*Death penalty. He voted to limit the ability of death-row inmates to challenge their sentence in federal court.</p>
        <p>*Education. He supported vouchers to help parents pay their children's private school tuition, and he voted to allow states to deny public education to illegal immigrants.</p>
        <p>*Litigation. He voted to limit punitive damages in product liability cases.</p>
        <p>*Health. He opposed a bipartisan bill last year that would place restrictions on health insurers and allow patients to sue their managed-care plans and supported instead Republican proposals that would not allow such lawsuits.</p>
        <p>*Suicide. He voted to overturn Oregon's assisted-suicide law.</p>
        <p>In December 1998, Mr. Lazio voted to impeach President Clinton on two of the four charges brought by the Judiciary Committee: for committing perjury before a grand jury and for obstructing justice in the civil suit brought by Paula Corbin Jones. He voted against impeachment for perjury in the civil suit and for lying to Congress in written answers to questions posed by the Judiciary Committee.</p>
        <p>''I bear no animus for Bill Clinton; I have no grudge against him,'' Mr. Lazio declared in a speech to the House during the impeachment debate. But he planned to vote for impeachment, he said, ''to hammer home as best I can that we must continue to insist that no one is above the law and that the truth must be told. We simply cannot tolerate dishonesty in the heart of our government.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio has been sufficiently loyal to his party's leaders that they have made him a deputy whip and one of two assistant majority leaders. One of his assignments is to be the liaison between the Republican leadership and the ''Lunch Bunch,'' a group of moderate Republicans, mostly from the Northeast, who meet weekly for lunch to discuss politics and legislation.</p>
        <p>The leaders also gave him a prized seat on the Commerce Committee, one of the most influential committees in Congress, and, waiving a party rule, allowed him to keep his chairmanship of the Banking Committee's Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity. Normally, members of the Commerce Committee are required to relinquish their seats on other committees.</p>
        <p>On abortion, Mr. Lazio has consistently opposed the efforts of many of his fellow Republicans to make abortion illegal. He also broke with his party to support federal criminal penalties for people who use force to block access to abortion clinics, and to allow organizations that use their own money to provide abortions in developing countries to be eligible for international family-planning funds.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Lazio has also opposed using federal Medicaid money to pay for abortions for poor women, and he has consistently voted to outlaw the late-term procedure that anti-abortion forces call partial-birth abortion.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Lazio's campaign was asked this week about the congressman's legislative accomplishments, staff members provided a long list of many modest, noncontroversial measures he had backed like a bill to crack down on Medicare and Medicaid fraud and one to create a screening program for breast and cervical cancer in poor and moderate-income women.</p>
        <p>Oddly, they did not include his most consequential accomplishment, the 1998 law that overhauls the nation's public housing system.</p>
        <p>Among many other aspects, the law is supposed to increase the proportion of public housing residents who work and require many of them to perform community service. It also encourages public housing authorities to reduce the concentration of very poor tenants in buildings, a situation Mr. Lazio believes contributes to crime.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio worked closely on the legislation with Andrew M. Cuomo, secretary of housing and urban development, and the bill eventually passed the House by an almost unanimous vote.</p>
        <p>On the minimum wage, Mr. Lazio tried to find legislation both parties could support. Democrats favor increasing the minimum to $6.15 an hour from the current $5.15 over two years. Most Republicans oppose raising the minimum wage but favor tax cuts for businesses.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio offered a compromise to raise the figure to $6.15 over three years and to join it with a $30 billion tax cut for businesses over five years. In March, the House passed a bill similar to Mr. Lazio's that would raise the minimum to $6.15 over two years and cut taxes by $46 billion over five years. That measure is now pending before the Senate.</p>
