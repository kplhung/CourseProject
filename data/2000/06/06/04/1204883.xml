        <p>Patrick Ewing was alone, as usual. While his teammates shook hands with a group of Indiana players fluttering around the floor like paper dolls, Ewing disappeared into the tunnel by himself Friday night. While the rest of the Knicks gathered their things and left Madison Square Garden after their elimination, he leaned back in his locker as if retreating into an isolation booth.</p>
        <p>He just stared ahead, lost in thought. Then a timer went off. He snapped to attention, peeled the ice bags off his joints and tossed one after another into a pile until it resembled a sandbag wall built to stop a flood. Just another barrier in the locker room, another visual to his solitary existence.</p>
        <p>''You know Patrick, he doesn't say much to us,'' Marcus Camby has said on a number of occasions this season. ''He doesn't talk to anyone.''</p>
        <p>But plenty was said about him this past week, some of it by the very players who, like so many outside the team, have little sympathy for an aging and aloof superstar on the decline. In the aftermath of the Knicks' Game 6 loss that gave the Pacers the Eastern Conference title, four games to two, the players offered up only transparent appreciation for Ewing. All the buzz phrases flowed: He's a warrior, he's gutsy, he's not to blame.</p>
        <p>''It's unfair for people to criticize him, but that's life,'' Allan Houston ventured. ''Not everyone is going to praise you. You'll have some critics. You do the best you can, and that's what Patrick does.''</p>
        <p>But over the last week, through innuendo and whispers, several players said the team was slowed down, held back and stylistically cramped with Ewing on the floor against the Pacers. Even Latrell Sprewell let the repetition of the popular stat -- the Knicks were 5-1 over two playoff runs against the Pacers without Ewing -- seep into his logic. ''Numbers don't lie,'' he said.</p>
        <p>It doesn't matter if the numbers are misleading or if their theories are flawed. While it is the players' fault they stand around in Ewing's presence -- sticking him with bail-out jumpers on the shot-clock, loitering in the background while he rebounds, failing to drive the lane when he is on the floor -- the perception has become reality.</p>
        <p>Ewing has become a mental albatross. If the team believes he weighs it down, then he does. If he has become the convenient alibi for the team's failure, maybe the excuse has to be removed. The team has grown weary of the reclusive Ewing. And at times, Ewing has been fed up with the organization's thin show of gratitude.</p>
        <p>In February, the general manager, Scott Layden, had a brief conversation with the Washington Wizards about trading Ewing back to a city that would embrace him for the Georgetown hero he was and the Hall of Fame player he is sure to be. Now, with one year left on Ewing's $68 million deal, one Eastern Conference official said the team would explore that option again. Ewing has a right of refusal in his contract. But there are very likely two teams he would agree to play for: Miami and Washington. The Wizards make the most sense.</p>
        <p>The Wizards will be searching for salary cap space for the summer of 2001, and Ewing's $16 million salary next season would fall off their payroll.</p>
        <p>Until the team has money to spend on free agents, Michael Jordan's cachet means nothing. In return, the Knicks would have to take Juwan Howard or Rod Strickland, plus some dead weight from the Wizards. There are luxury tax issues that would come with Howard, but the Knicks might find a creative way to lower their burden. If not this deal, then some move will be made by the Knicks.</p>
        <p>''It's going to be a long summer,'' said Chris Childs, who is eternally on the trading block. ''Management will do what they do and make decisions. Whatever decisions they make, they'll make. We had an opportunity this year, and we didn't cash in on it.''</p>
        <p>Upon his arrival late last summer, Layden kept a low profile, remained a barely audible and hardly visible executive, and did nothing to improve the Knicks before the trade deadline. With a season that did not live up to expectations -- as extreme as they were -- decisions have to be made.</p>
        <p>Do they trade the fragile Camby or trust him as their starting center if Ewing is hurt or in another team's jersey? Do they re-sign the temperamental Kurt Thomas or let him go? Do they make a bid for John Starks or look for another 3-point threat in reserve clothing? Do they address the structural flaw they have with Sprewell at small forward or leave him as a complement to Houston? Do they believe in Charlie Ward the playoff hero or fear he will revert to his regular-season inconsistency?</p>
        <p>At some point, the Knicks have to find more value from their roster. Coach Jeff Van Gundy's seven-man rotation in the playoffs eventually created conditions that were ripe for injuries.</p>
        <p>Throughout the playoffs, the Knicks' roster looked like a storage area for outdated parts. On the end of the bench, there were uplifting chemistry guys, but how much could David Wingate and Andrew Lang help in the end? Once the young but unused John Wallace did dust himself off to play in Game 4 against Indiana, he was not able to function on command.</p>
        <p>In an ill-fated, Van Gundy-supported signing that did not work, Wallace was the only notable move the Knicks made last summer. This summer, it is up to Layden to upgrade the team. He is reputed to be a draft guru able to pluck talent ready for action instead of a project player like the Knicks' lost Frenchman, Frederic Weis. As last year's 15th pick over all, Weis may never see Madison Square Garden without a tour guide.</p>
        <p>As Utah's architect, Layden did not have to take many free-agency risks with Karl Malone and John Stockton working their illusive bob-and-weave, pick-and-roll to the delight of Jazz fans.</p>
        <p>Layden could bide his time without pressure. In New York, patience snuffs out careers. Coach Pat Riley could unearth his Holy Grail by nabbing a great shooting guard, Philadelphia might only get better, Toronto may discover peace amid its dysfunction and Orlando Coach Doc Rivers could lure Tim Duncan from San Antonio.</p>
        <p>The Knicks cannot afford to stay put with a roster dotted with deteriorating veterans, like Ewing, Larry Johnson and Chris Childs, and filled with likable but inconsistent stars, like Camby, Houston and Sprewell. After last year's run to the finals, the Knicks trusted that the expiration date on the magic potion they thrived on last season would last through the third week of June this season.</p>
        <p>But the potion curdled Friday night, just before 10 p.m. At that moment, Ewing slipped away from the Pacer-infused commotion on his home court. As a punctuation to his inglorious departure, he was heckled upon his exit. Whom will they berate if he is gone? Whom will his teammates have to blame?</p>
