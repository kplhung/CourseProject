        <p>A man arrested on a minor drug charge was identified through fingerprints as a suspect in a murder committed nearly eight years ago, the police said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Officer Don Nelson of the 67th Precinct in East Flatbush, Brooklyn, arrested the suspect, Lecene Brim, 26, on marijuana possession charges on Friday after he was seen in a car with a bag of marijuana on the seat next to him, the police said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brim fled to Jamaica soon after the killing of a 14-year-old boy, Kaleek Clark Johnson, in the lobby of a Brooklyn apartment building on Aug. 18, 1992, the police said. He remained there for several years.  Mr. Brim refused to give his name after he was arrested, but he was identified through his fingerprints, the police said. Mr. Brim, of 250 East 96th Street in Brooklyn, was charged with second-degree murder.</p>
        <p>Detectives said Mr. Brim had always been a suspect but they had too little evidence to arrest him because they were unable to persuade any of the witnesses to testify.</p>
        <p>Several of the witnesses subsequently moved to other areas and were less afraid of retaliation, said Lt. John Dove of the Cold Case Squad, which was still pursuing the  case. But by the time detectives believed that they had a strong enough case to charge Mr. Brim, they could not find him, Lieutenant Dove said.</p>
