        <p>'Face to Face 2'  The Stage Gallery, 2222 Hewlett Avenue, Merrick. Through June 20. Hours: (516) 623-3504.</p>
        <p>In this juried show of portraits, not all the depictions are literal.  Likenesses of specific individuals share gallery space with mythological and fanciful characters.</p>
        <p>In Kaja Melander's ''Water Sprite,'' the fabled creature is embodied by a ceramic mask cast from life and adorned with seashells. The young man who whoops it up in Andrea Hesselbach's painting, ''Wild at Heart,'' is both individualized and symbolic of an intense emotional state, which is enhanced by the suggestion of a smoldering atmosphere.  Nearby, Duane Stahl's multilayered print, ''Yawn,'' uses a similar open-mouthed pose to indicate the opposite extreme.</p>
        <p>Taking his cue from Chuck Close's fingerprint portraits, Carl Grombert uses tiny rubber stamps of a boy's face to construct that of a man. The implication of ''Collective Memory'' is that adult identity is shaped by childhood. In another incremental work, Derek Hobbs uses cutout and pasted words to suggest the issues that trouble his pensive subject.</p>
        <p>Janet Kozachek imagines the mythic Endymion as a mosaic mask, perhaps a comment on the superficiality of beauty. Her other entry, ''Face of Fire,'' is even more symbolic, with flamelike adornments to complete the metaphor. In contrast to this generalized approach, Connie Connelly examines herself, family members and friends in ''People I Know,'' a group portrait consisting of 12 individual studies in the spirit of Lucien Freud.</p>
        <p>'Sculpture: Three Views'  East End Arts Council, 133 East Main Street, Riverhead. Through June 24. Hours: (631) 727- 0900.</p>
        <p>Although the exhibition does not consist exclusively of sculpture, it was organized by three sculptors, each of whom was given a free hand in one of the East End Arts Council's three galleries. Two of the artists chose to include their own work with that of others, while the third opted to highlight a single work by someone else.</p>
        <p>That piece, Maureen Palmieri's ''Dreamsuckle,'' was chosen by Sara D'Alessandro. With an antique brass bedstead as its framework, the sculpture mimics a traditional patchwork quilt, but with a twist.  Simultaneously comforting and threatening, the piece is about ambivalence on several levels and invites speculation on the nature of nurture.</p>
        <p>Found-object sculptures by Janet Nolan and Pam Brown also transform everyday items by creating suggestive combinations. Ms. Nolan's ''Sprout,'' for example, changes a metal colander into a helmet that seems to be growing wire hair. For Ms. Brown, sheet-metal cones and tapering wire cages are the basic building blocks of many of her untitled works, which range in mood from whimsical to vaguely ominous.</p>
        <p>Marianne Weil juxtaposes her bronze sculptures with prints by Ellen Wiener and paintings by Myrna Burks to highlight the effects of layering in various media. The subtle buildup of tones and textures in Ms. Weil's rich patinas, as in the diptych ''During the Fall I and II,'' are echoed in Ms. Burks's handsome abstractions, which use oil colors and wax in translucent overlays. Similarly, Ms. Wiener's monotypes involve successive layering to establish both pattern and structure.</p>
        <p>'Site Specifics 2000'  The Carriage House, Islip Art Museum, 50 Irish Lane, East Islip. Through July 9. Hours: (631) 224-5402.</p>
        <p>Transforming the building's various unused spaces into sculptural environments is the challenge faced by seven artists who were invited to participate in the museum's latest round of site-specific installations.</p>
        <p>One of the most successful is ''Water Fountain,'' Judy Richardson's clever response to the building's bathroom, where the slop sink and shower have been adapted as catchment pools. Instead of featuring traditional sprays, however, the fountains appear to channel water, which cascades gracefully through scrim, wire mesh and wattle, from a leaking roof. Ms. Richardson has also responded to the building's exterior with a piece called ''Giant Rope,'' a braid of cable, chain and fiber that cascades like Rapunzel's hair from a tower window.</p>
        <p>In a darkened space, Heidi Kumao's shadowy projections examine everyday rituals and repetitive actions as the building blocks of relationships. A mother feeding a child, a couple joining hands and other commonplace gestures are mediated by mechanical reproduction and, in the case of ''Childhood Rituals: Consumption,'' are further distanced by projection on a curtain. The same movement or action, repeated endlessly without variation, becomes symbolic of the survival mechanisms and automatic responses developed during socialization.</p>
        <p>In Ludwika Ogorzelec's ''Space Crystallization,'' the wood seems to grow the way minerals crystalize, creating a three-dimensional maze of boxy latticework transected by a fracturelike structure. The space envelops the viewer with a combination of tactile and spatial challenges.</p>
