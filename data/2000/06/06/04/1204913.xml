        <p>Running Stag, the world-traveling racehorse, won the Massachusetts Handicap at Suffolk Downs in Boston yesterday against a strong field of senior horses, which lost its favorite, Behrens, last week.</p>
        <p>Running Stag, a 6-year-old bay, has traveled in the last six months to Saratoga Springs, N.Y., New York City, England, Hong Kong and Dubai, and he was at his best in Boston. He challenged the front-running David and drew clear in the homestretch, winning by one length over Out of Mind, with David third. The winner, trained by Philip Mitchell with John Velazquez riding, ran the mile and an eighth in 1:492</p>

        <p>Running Stag, the world-traveling racehorse, won the Massachusetts Handicap at Suffolk Downs in Boston yesterday against a strong field of senior horses, which lost its favorite, Behrens, last week.</p>
        <p>Running Stag, a 6-year-old bay, has traveled in the last six months to Saratoga Springs, N.Y., New York City, England, Hong Kong and Dubai, and he was at his best in Boston. He challenged the front-running David and drew clear in the homestretch, winning by one length over Out of Mind, with David third. The winner, trained by Philip Mitchell with John Velazquez riding, ran the mile and an eighth in 1:492</p>
        <p>Behrens was scratched after his trainer, James Bond, decided his bruised left front ankle was too tender.</p>
        <p>SHEEPSHEAD BAY HANDICAP: The 5-year-old Irish mare Lisieux Rose made it 2 for 2 in the United States since arriving last winter, going wire to wire to win the Sheepshead Bay Handicap at Belmont Park by two lengths over Melody Queen.</p>
        <p>Lisieux Rose, trained by Christophe Clement and ridden by Jose Santos, won the Orchid Handicap at Gulfstream Park in March, then came back after three months to outrun her six rivals in the Sheepshead Bay. She ran the mile and three-eighths on the turf in 2:14, returned $5.60 for a $2 bet to win and earned $90,000. The British filly La Ville Rouge ran third while the favorite, The Seven Seas, tired in the homestretch and finished last.</p>
