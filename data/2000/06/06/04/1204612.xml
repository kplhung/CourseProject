        <p>Fashion often revives past successes and presents them in a fresh mix. This spring, it's the romantic blouse for day and evening, made of see-through fabric, always worn with a bra, and now worn with trousers rather than a skirt. The dressy blouse was a major fashion player during World War II, when fabric restrictions turned it into the center of style, dressing up the tailored suit. The new crop of blouses, with their long poet's sleeves, came into focus at a recent reception, when three women appeared wearing the same dotted style by Tuleh. Other designers have shown the ruffly styles peeking out from under day jackets. The most modern shape is Helmut Lang's (far right), without sleeves, worn over slim trousers with strappy high heels.</p>
