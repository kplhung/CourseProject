        <p>Chris Holt won for the first time in five interleague starts, and the host Astros beat the Chicago White Sox, 6-1, in a game that included a false fire alarm and a ball hit off Enron Field's ceiling.</p>
        <p>Holt (3-6) allowed eight hits in eight innings, allowing Carlos Lee's seventh-inning homer.</p>
        <p>Richard Hidalgo hit a two-run homer in the sixth inning, his 17th, as Houston stopped a four-game losing streak.</p>
        <p>Fans were startled by a first-inning fire alarm. When a siren went off with the Astros batting, fans were told to leave the stadium. Seconds later, fans some started to rise from their seats to leave, the command was withdrawn. Play was delayed about a minute.</p>
        <p>Houston's Mitch Meluskey fouled a pitch off one of Enron's girders above the third-base line in the second inning, the first ball to hit Enron's ceiling.</p>
        <p>The ball careened back into fair territory and was caught by pitcher Kip Wells, but was ruled a dead ball by the plate umpire Travis Katzenmeier.</p>
        <p>REDS 9, TWINS 3: Barry Larkin and Ken Griffey Jr. homered as host Cincinnati beat Minnesota on a night dedicated to past champions.</p>
        <p>Dante Bichette also hit a home run forthe Reds.</p>
        <p>Denny Neagle (5-0) remained unbeaten since last Aug. 30, a span of 19 starts, by giving up four hits in seven innings. He also singled with the bases loaded to spark the go-ahead rally in the fourth inning.</p>
        <p>TIGERS 5, CUBS 3: Damion Easley, activated from the disabled list Friday, drove in three runs as Detroit beat the host Cubs. Juan Gonzalez drove in another run with a fourth-inning single.</p>
        <p>MARLINS 2, BLUE JAYS 1: Mike Lowell and Kevin Millar hit consecutive home runs off Billy Koch in the eighth inning to lead host Florida past Toronto.</p>
        <p>Chris Carpenter allowed five hits in seven shutout innings.</p>
        <p>Billy Koch (3-1) to start the eighth and blew a save for the fourth time in 15 chances.</p>
        <p>PHILLIES 9, RED SOX 3: Mike Lieberthal homered twice and matched his career high with five runs batted in as host Philadelphia sent Boston to its fourth straight loss.</p>
        <p>With Pedro Martinez scratched because of a sore left ribcage, the knuckleballer Tim Wakefield (1-4) made his third start of the season for Boston, which matched its longest losing streak of the season. Wakefield gave up all six runs -- four earned -- and seven hits in four and two-thirds innings and Boston dropped to 5-7 against Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>EXPOS 7, ORIOLES 4: Geoff Blum matched his career high with three runs batted in, including a two-run homer, and Vladimir Guerrero hit his 16th home run as host Montreal Expos beat Baltimore.</p>
        <p>Baltimore lost despite a two-run homer by Albert Belle and back-to-back homers in the fourth by B.J. Surhoff and Charles Johnson.</p>
        <p>ROYALS 16, PIRATES 3: Mike Sweeney was 4 for 5 with a career-high five R.B.I. as visiting Kansas City beat Pittsburgh.</p>
        <p>Sweeney, Jermaine Dye and Brian Johnson homered for the Royals.</p>
        <p>INDIANS 4, CARDINALS 2: Mark McGwire broke up Bartolo Colon's no-hit bid with a seventh-inning single but visiting Cleveland, behind home runs from David Justice and Richie Sexson, beat St. Louis. Colon (6-2) matched his season high with 12 strikeouts.</p>
        <p>BREWERS 2, ROCKIES 1: The pinch-hitter James Mouton singled home Luis Lopez with one out in the 12th inning to give host Milwaukee Brewers a victory over Colorado.</p>
        <p>Stan Belinda (1-1) hit Lopez with a pitch leading off. Lopez took second on Raul Casanova's sacrifice and went to third on a wild pitch before Mouton singled to center.</p>
