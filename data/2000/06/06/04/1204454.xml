        <p>''Authentic is a funny word. In a lot of recent books about food and cooking, authenticity seems to entail being somebody entirely other than who you actually are. Enter the magical kingdom of the book and you become a Vietnamese farmer, a Manhattan chef, your great-grandmother, a Roman housewife. Of course, these transformations are fundamentally impossible. Youre still you -- youre just pretending. And so ''authentic comes to mean its opposite. For your spaghetti carbonara, you may search out real pancetta or, even better, guanciale, if youre trying to recreate the experience of the dish as its known and loved in Italy. But lets face it, the only truly authentic spaghetti carbonara is made by Romans in Rome. Does this mean that American cooking enthusiasts, we supremely multicultural omnivores, are condemned to inhabit a culinary Epcot, a universe of simulations?</p>
        <p>Ive been pawing through a mighty heap of new food books for the last several months, and the really bad ones -- a capacious category -- are as stunningly bogus as the New Yorks, Venices and rain forests of Las Vegas. The worst of these gastropornographies, which come at you with the mirthless smiles of theme-park greeters, often are devoted to some single restaurant or chef, and they tend to promote a ''vision -- an ''authentic experience of a paradise that never was. Luckily, many of us have had plenty of authentic experience that reaches well beyond that of earlier generations of American cooks, imprisoned as they often were in the likes of ''365 Ways to Cook Hamburger. Weve eaten authentic spaghetti carbonara in Rome. We may also have had some dreadful imitation of it in Vegas -- and we know the difference.</p>

        <p>Ive been pawing through a mighty heap of new food books for the last several months, and the really bad ones -- a capacious category -- are as stunningly bogus as the New Yorks, Venices and rain forests of Las Vegas. The worst of these gastropornographies, which come at you with the mirthless smiles of theme-park greeters, often are devoted to some single restaurant or chef, and they tend to promote a ''vision -- an ''authentic experience of a paradise that never was.

        <p>We dont have to be Tuscan farmers to know what real Tuscan farm food tastes like. O.K., so we dont get it perfect. But if were well guided, we can come pretty close. And thats what constitutes American authenticity: tasting everything, good and bad, domestic and foreign; learning how it works; trying it out; keeping some of it and letting some go; figuring out how to tell the good from the mediocre, the great from the good. In the end, though, such an education does entail a certain element of make-believe -- youll cook better Roman food when you can pretend to think like a Roman, if only during the cooking -- and thats why todays American gastronomy is so entertaining. Its theater.</p>
        <p>When I opened SIMPLY TUSCAN: Recipes for a Well-Lived Life (Doubleday, $35), by Pino Luongo, my first thought was ''Uh-oh. Luongo presides over a collection of intensely theatrical Italian restaurants as well as Tuscan Square, a store in Manhattan that hawks the Tuscan lifestyle with all the down-home authenticity of a market-segmentation study. The introduction to Luongos cookbook even leads off with this sort of guff: ''I make no bones about it. Im here to convert you to Tuscanism. The marketing version of Tuscany features lots of misty olive-and-vine landscapes, ocher stucco and languid afternoons on the terrace, cleverly shrouding the authentic historic character of the Tuscans, which tends more toward social Darwinism, Machiavellian intrigue and hard-nosed business. True Tuscanism is nicely embodied in the name of Luongos company, Toscorp.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, the cookbook part of ''Simply Tuscan is worthy of the title. The recipes are arranged around special occasions -- Easter dinner, a lunch for kids, falls first truffle dinner, ''a dinner date for two prepared by him -- and the dishes are earthy, frank and delicious. Whats most authentic about Luongos approach is its dependence on the highest-quality ingredients. Lamb stew with artichokes is just that and not much else. If the recipe is made with superlative lamb and artichokes, its going to taste great; if not, not. Watermelon granita requires frequent stirring and slow freezing of nothing more than melon, sugar and lemon juice -- a sublime</p>
        <p>summer slush, as long as you start with perfect watermelon. A stuffing featuring pancetta, prosciutto, rosemary and fennel seeds made the trout roasted in the style of porchetta way too pungent for me, but some of Luongos other unlikely combinations are surprisingly harmonious, like his artichoke heart salad with oysters and radicchio. This too is a dish that demands impeccable ingredients. The artichokes should be genuinely fresh, the oysters shucked in situ.</p>
        <p>''Many recipes in this book are not classic Tuscan, Luongo writes, ''but they are Tuscan in spirit. They are, in fact, adaptations to American conditions, ingredients and tastes -- and, as such, all the more authentically American.</p>
        <p>Nothing could be farther from Tuscan earthiness than the celestial haute cuisine of Alain Ducasse. Ducasses atelier approach to cooking -- teaching his chefs to execute his ideas so well that their work is indistinguishable from his own -- has made him the only person ever to run two restaurants simultaneously that have each been awarded three Michelin stars, and the food they turn out bears considerably more resemblance to fine art than to home cooking.</p>
        <p>LATELIER OF ALAIN DUCASSE: The Artistry of a Master Chef and His Proteges (Wiley, $60) has an interesting premise. First the master selects a theme in the form of an ingredient that he considers the finest of its kind in the world -- asparagus from Villelaure, Mediterranean sea bass, lamb from the Pyrenees -- and then he and five of his ''students, all of them now masters in their own right, each create a spectacular (and sometimes awesomely laborious) dish based on this theme. For a particular variety of olive from the Ligurian Riviera, for example, Ducasse builds Mediterranean vegetable pithiviers with black Taggiasca olives and tomato syrup, while Alessandro Stratta comes up with calfs cheeks with olives and Swiss chard, and Jean-Fran--&gt;ois Piege makes olive-stuffed squab with olive and cepe sauce.</p>
        <p>''LAtelier of Alain Ducasse (whose text is by Benedict Beauge) presents itself as a cookbook, and some of the recipes could conceivably be tackled by a home cook. But for most of us who lack a staff of dozens, who dont feel like boning calves feet after a hard day at the office and for whom it may not be so easy to get hold of Breton turbot, chicken kidneys or cockscombs, this is really a book of dreams. It differs radically from the many atrocious books of its kind that are nothing but dreams, however, in that it provides genuinely useful insights into the workings of both the mind and the hands of one of the worlds great cooks.</p>
        <p>Corinne Trangs mother is French. Her father is of Chinese extraction, was raised in Cambodia and speaks seven languages. Trang herself grew up in France and frequently visited her paternal relatives in Cambodia, Vietnam and Indonesia. She now lives in New York, where, as she puts it, ''I learned to see cuisines evolutionary mechanics from day to day, driven by experimentation and a relaxed, nonideological attitude toward cooking. Her new book, AUTHENTIC VIETNAMESE COOKING: Food From a Family Table (Simon &amp; Schuster, $30), is also authentically American in its heritage of heterogeneity. Vietnamese cooking, she writes, ''embodies the blend of French and Chinese culinary traditions, and so mirrors my own experiences and personal history.</p>
        <p>Trangs food can be chili hot, lettuce mild, caramel sweet, lime sour, crusty crisp, starchy mushy; an a cappella aria of a primary ingredient or a funky, mysterious pastiche. It may be several of these things at once. It is never timid. From Mam Nem (pineapple and anchovy dipping sauce) to Che Dau Xanh (sweet mung bean soup), theres a lot of unfamiliar territory to explore. And theres much to learn, as Trang points out, from ''the historical Vietnamese process of absorption, adaptation, refinement -- of invention and discipline held in the mind simultaneously.</p>
        <p>In THE MINIMALIST COOKS AT HOME (Broadway, $25), ''home is an ordinary American kitchen. Its getting toward dinnertime, youre tired, youre hungry, you had Chinese takeout last night and cardboard-scented pizza the night before that, and the new bistro you tried last week was pretty good but it cost $150 for the two of you. Dont despair: Mark Bittman is here to save your bacon.</p>
        <p>Actually, its O.K. if you dont have any bacon. Bittman (who writes a column called The Minimalist for the Dining section of The New York Times) specializes in a kind of cooking that is pre-eminently flexible. Pasta with meaty bones will feed four to six on one piece of veal shank, but if you dont even have that, ''a bit of smoked meat is really great in place of the fresh meat. In fact, ''you can use almost any bony meat you want here. Also, ''carrots make a nice addition. In short, Bittman is a real cook, someone who knows that ''cooking is not a set of dogmas but a craft that can be learned and enjoyed. All his recipes offer a range of easygoing variations, and this antiauthoritarian congeniality allows you to make a tasty meal that accords with what you feel like and what youve got on hand.</p>
        <p>Only rarely do Bittmans dishes get weird. An entire bottle of red wine soaked up into a pound of spaghetti gives you a beautiful, gleaming, dark red heap of noodles, but it tastes -- well, it tastes weird. Fortunately, most of Bittmans food is rooted in tradition, good sense and good taste. And you can make it in real-life circumstances.</p>
        <p>Imagine being the son of Marcella Hazan and daring to write cookbooks! Hazan madre famously revealed the austere simplicity of real Italian cooking to the land of leaden saltimbocca and industrial ''parmesan shaken out of a canister. Now Hazan figlio dares to traffic in still simpler simplicity. In Giuliano Hazans EVERY NIGHT ITALIAN (Scribner, $25), every dish can be made in under 45 minutes -- many of them well under. The ingredients are almost shockingly few. Hazans cooking expresses eloquently the reason so many Americans come home from Italy and search in vain for the sort of food they had over there: the Italians dont muck things up with a bunch of stuff.</p>
        <p>In Valerie Martins novel ''Italian Fever, the American heroines Italian lover and a waiter, after some study, choose a particular sea bass, to be ''grilled whole, with just a touch of olive oil and salt. No parsley, they agreed. This was sometimes done, but it was unnecessary, for it added nothing to the perfection of a good fresh fish. In America, were all too likely to get the fish with not just parsley but chives, oregano, tomatoes, three colors of sweet peppers, jalapenos, capers, garlic, onions, olive oil, butter, lemon juice, lemon peel and little frizzles of fried baby leeks on a bed of mizuna. This is why we need Giuliano Hazan.</p>
        <p>He braises beef chuck in milk with onions and carrots. He puts grated orange zest in an otherwise ordinary crust and fills it with eggs, sugar and orange juice. To classically unadorned spaghetti carbonara, he adds a little zucchini. Fresh tomatoes, basil, onion and olive oil dress orecchiette, with a few shavings of ricotta salata on top. In one of his basic dishes, the combination of olives, anchovies, garlic, chicken, some wine, salt and pepper -- and, at the end, a little lemon juice and parsley -- spells perfection. Of course, for all these recipes you must have good zucchini, good cheese, good olives, good chicken.</p>
        <p>Because Hazans cooking is so true to its heritage and at the same time so welcoming to those of us not born to any single culinary tradition, ''Every Night Italian epitomizes authenticity in a time when global cross-breeding and competition can yield Kafkaesque complexity or Disneyesque oversimplification. This food is genius -- genius distilled from history.</p>
        <p>Italians like to end a long meal with something bitter (an amaro) or something searing (a grappa). And they want everybody to go to bed happy. In that spirit, please allow me in closing to commend to you KITCHEN CONFIDENTIAL: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly (Bloomsbury, $24.95), by Anthony Bourdain.</p>
        <p>This is one bitter, nasty, searing, hard-to-swallow piece of work. But if you can choke the thing down, youll probably wake up grinning in the middle of the night. Bourdain is a force of unruly nature, a lifelong misanthrope and currently the executive chef at the Brasserie Les Halles, whose clientele, now that this book is out, must be accounted among the more courageous diners in New York.</p>
        <p>In a style partaking of Hunter S. Thompson, Iggy Pop and a little Jonathan Swift, Bourdain gleefully rips through the scenery to reveal private backstage horrors little dreamed of by the trusting public. He calls paying customers ''weekend rubes and describes himself in an earlier, less enlightened incarnation as ''a shiftless, untrustworthy coke-sniffer, sneak thief and corner-cutting hack. Thankfully, in his new life he has retained his brutal honesty. ''The reuse of bread, he informs us, ''is an industry-wide practice, and he cant resist adding that ''once in a while some tubercular hillbilly has been coughing and spraying in the general direction of that bread basket.</p>
        <p>Whats it like to open a new restaurant? ''With every dime youve got tied up in your new place, suddenly the drains in your prep kitchen are backing up with raw sewage. . . . Your bartender is giving away the bar to underage girls from Wantagh, any one of whom could then crash Daddys Buick into a busload of divinity students. . . . Theres the ongoing struggle with rodents and cockroaches, any one of which could crawl across the Tina Brown four-top in the middle of the dessert course; you just bought $10,000 worth of shrimp when the market was low, but the walk-in freezer just went on the fritz and naturally its a holiday weekend, so good luck getting a service call in time; the dishwasher just walked out after arguing with the busboy, and they need glasses now on Table 7. . . . And is that the New York Times reviewer waiting for your hostess to stop flirting and notice her?</p>
        <p>You may find this revolting. I think the guy is hysterical. Hes also, beneath it all, devoted to good food and the very difficult life that goes with cooking it professionally. Bourdain trades merrily on his raw authenticity. To a world infested with synthesized romance, candlelit illusions and sentimental piety, ''Kitchen Confidential offers a nice palate-clearing taste of poison.</p>
