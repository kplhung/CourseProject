        <p>Stonwin Farm, the 15-acre Scarsdale estate of the late jewelry legend Harry Winston, went on the market Wednesday for $27 million, and the broker for the property, Patricia Burnham, said she already had five potential buyers. The estate has eight and a half bathrooms, a pool, tennis courts, stables and its own gas pump. It has been in the Winston family for 60 years and is being sold by Mr. Winston's son, Ronald, president of Harry Winston Inc. ''It is the cherry orchard with apple trees,'' he said, explaining how he agonized about the sale by recalling the Chekhov play about a family's angst in selling its cherry orchard.</p>
