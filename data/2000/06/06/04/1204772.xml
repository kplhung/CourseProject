        <p>Editorial finds CBS's Survivor series, which debuted last week, a pale comparison to William Golding's Lord of the Flies</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The first airing of the ''Survivor'' game show on CBS last week, with 16 strangers marooned on a Malaysian island, produced an oddly captivating form of entertainment. Unlike the usual fare for reality voyeurs, there was no sex or madness or murder, not even any real nudity in this first of 13 programs scheduled over the summer. But many of the nation's young adult viewers seem to be titillated by how modern Americans fare in what passes these days for wilderness -- a few tough weeks without hot showers, frozen dinners and cell phones.</p>
        <p>Even the camera crews, the emergency helicopters loitering nearby and the hovering presence of the host failed to dissipate viewer fascination with this latest network experiment. It is no wonder that public television is racing to cash in on the trend, albeit by importing a British version that is set in a Victorian-era house without plumbing or electricity.</p>

        <p>The first airing of the ''Survivor'' game show on CBS last week, with 16 strangers marooned on a Malaysian island, produced an oddly captivating form of entertainment. Unlike the usual fare for reality voyeurs, there was no sex or madness or murder, not even any real nudity in this first of 13 programs scheduled over the summer. But many of the nation's young adult viewers seem to be titillated by how modern Americans fare in what passes these days for wilderness -- a few tough weeks without hot showers, frozen dinners and cell phones.</p>
        <p>Even the camera crews, the emergency helicopters loitering nearby and the hovering presence of the host failed to dissipate viewer fascination with this latest network experiment. It is no wonder that public television is racing to cash in on the trend, albeit by importing a British version that is set in a Victorian-era house without plumbing or electricity.</p>
        <p>Last week's introduction to ''Survivor'' made it clear that even the losers on this show will win their share of national notice. With Web-site bios and daily video updates via the Internet, each personality will get an opportunity to unfold before millions of computer-savvy peers. In the first segment, some participants looked too anxious, some too nice. A few looked too much like loners to be comfortable in  such a communal setting, while several appeared to be severely fame-obsessed.</p>
        <p>Personality and skills are important because the rules of this shipwreck party require the group to take a vote and kick one person off the island in each segment. On the final show, the whole team returns to the island to choose the last survivor, who then earns $1 million. Sociologists and scholars of modern culture should have a field day.</p>
        <p>The workaday reality of this show appears to be less about poisonous snakes and rat stew than it is about skinned shins, frayed tempers and bug bites. For those expecting high drama and excitement on a wilderness island, William Golding did it far better almost half a century ago in his book ''Lord of the Flies.''</p>
        <p>Stacey, the wily lawyer, Rudy, the retired Navy Seal barking orders at his new mates, and Sean, the doctor with pierced body parts, may be real human contestants burning under the Borneo sun. But they pale in comparison to Ralph, Jack and Piggy.</p>
