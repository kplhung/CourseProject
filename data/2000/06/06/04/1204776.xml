        <p>New York City residents have long hoped to reclaim their Hudson River shoreline south of 59th Street by restoring rotting piers and replacing the parking lots and other bleak spaces that now exist with an inviting mix of walkways, playing fields and modest commercial development. The last major obstacle to that dream has now been removed. On Thursday, the United States Army Corps of Engineers gave final approval for work to begin.</p>
        <p>The focus now shifts from the approval process, which has had supporters of the park in a state of high anxiety for two years, to the Hudson River Park Trust, which is in charge of the project and has no further reason for delay. There is $100 million in state and city money in the bank. Architectural plans should be completed in short order and contracts put out for bid, with actual construction to commence as soon as possible.</p>
        <p>The plan envisions a five-mile-long waterfront esplanade, from Battery Park City north to 59th Street, with bicycle and running paths and a narrow buffer of lawn and open space between the West Side Highway and the river. The park's main attraction, however, will be 13 huge piers, now falling apart, that will be rebuilt for recreational purposes and for a limited number of small-scale commercial enterprises like restaurants.</p>
        <p>In September 1988, the State Legislature approved a bill authorizing the park. But the project could not proceed without corps approval. Opponents, worried about development and the impact on the river's striped bass, urged the corps to undertake a full environmental impact statement, a process that could have delayed the project for two more years. The corps chose not to do so for several reasons. First, New York State had already done a massive impact statement. The corps also decided that the park would have ''no significant impact'' on the marine environment and that a full-scale federal assessment was therefore not required under the National Environmental Policy Act.</p>
        <p>This page has long argued that environmental impact statements are an essential tool for protecting the nation's natural resources. But in this case such an assessment would have been largely redundant. Moreover, environmental law requires a full-scale federal assessment only when preliminary investigation suggests that a project might have ''significant impact.'' The corps was right to conclude that this project would not. All the reconstruction work will be done within the ''footprint'' of the piers that now exist, so that when the work is completed, the fish habitat will be essentially as it is today. There will be no new platforms and no new landfills. Indeed, the National Marine Fisheries Service concluded that the project would actually improve the fish habitat because it will safeguard the piers, which are important to the fish.</p>
        <p>The critics warn of further lawsuits. But their objections have been thoroughly examined and, in our view, forthrightly addressed. Indeed, some of their earlier complaints led to useful improvements in the original plan. They should take pride in that accomplishment, and let the plan go forward.</p>
