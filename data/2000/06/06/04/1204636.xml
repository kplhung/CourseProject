        <p>WHY is the whole town in a tizzy over Patti LuPone?'' Gino Megaro wanted to know. ''Who is she anyway?'' he kept asking as delirious people descended upon his namesake pizzeria on Irving Street in Rahway, just across the street from the Union County Arts Center.</p>
        <p>They could have told him who she is, if they calmed down. But others sauntered in and shrugged; just dropping by for a slice. Yes, there was the claque from across the river, and there were New Jersey's theater mavens, but it was mostly locals who filled the 1,310-seat theater on May 12. And if this town was in a tizzy, that was because something was in the air, a sense of event, anticipation, buzz.</p>

        <p>WHY is the whole town in a tizzy over Patti LuPone?'' Gino Megaro wanted to know. ''Who is she anyway?'' he kept asking as delirious people descended upon his namesake pizzeria on Irving Street in Rahway, just across the street from the Union County Arts Center.</p>
        <p>They could have told him who she is, if they calmed down. But others sauntered in and shrugged; just dropping by for a slice. Yes, there was the claque from across the river, and there were New Jersey's theater mavens, but it was mostly locals who filled the 1,310-seat theater on May 12. And if this town was in a tizzy, that was because something was in the air, a sense of event, anticipation, buzz.</p>
        <p>Penn and Teller did one recent performance here. So did Three Dog Night. ''Man of La Mancha'' had 11, including one Wednesday morning for students, in a ''semi-professional production,'' one observer said.</p>
        <p>But Patti LuPone imparts the aura of a New York class act.</p>
        <p>While change -- a moment, an inflection, a response -- is integral to a live performance, Ms. LuPone insists that ''Matters of the Heart,'' which is to open the season at Theaterfest in Montclair on Thursday, is ''the same show -- all of it'' that she performed in Rahway.</p>
        <p>It is emphatically a theater piece. No casual banter. None of the snappy patter that she sprinkled through her 1995 Broadway concert. Only a finely shaped pop-chamber recital, with a string quartet and a piano.</p>
        <p>The trajectory of Ms. LuPone's career has been uncommonly inclusive, wildly scattershot on the surface, yet driven by an artist's wanderlust. Classically trained, as actress and as singer, Ms. LuPone cannot be and will not be typed. After her breakout performance as Broadway's first Evita, a performance that earned her the right to claim the appellation diva, she was offered Lady Macbeth at Lincoln Center. No way, she said. Off she flew to the Guthrie in Minneapolis for a go at Rosalind in ''As You Like It,'' one of Shakespeare's most divine creations. And after a roaring success in a revision of ''Anything Goes,'' she was classified as a belter, the new Merman. She went for Mamet, feeling that she is a disciple of his work, with four of his roles in a repertory of seemingly infinite variety.</p>
        <p>Given the warmth, grace and tenderness of ''Matters of the Heart'' -- its songs, encompassing Judy Collins, Randy Newman, John Bucchino, Stephen Sondheim, Lennon and McCartney, Rodgers and Hammerstein, have been recorded in a CD by the same title -- it is facile to call the show a departure. Tell her that and she'll go right into her contrarian mode.</p>
        <p>''I am a hired hand, a working actor playing parts that are not who I am,'' she said in a telephone conversation from a dude ranch in Tucson -- downtime with her husband and 9-year-old son, after three concert performances as the mad Mrs. Lovett in a concert version of ''Sweeney Todd'' at Alice Tully Hall. ''So this is not a departure. It's who I am. I'm in control.''</p>
        <p>''And I am not a belter,'' she added. ''I have a high chest voice; being a belter is dangerous to the voice and I've never been that type.'' Type? Ms. LuPone is a dramatic soprano whose interpretive gifts take charge. Her vocal instrument is not always obedient to musical demands but her musicianship is unfailing. Her songs are not about the notes. They are propelled by emotional purpose, intensity, both ardent and burning, and enormous comic flair. It is no stretch to call her the Callas of the popular song, and it was divined that she should play La Divina in ''Master Class'' on Broadway. If she is not Callas incarnate, to the point of lips, profile, temperament, then she must be a reincarnation in art, though definitely not in life. For Ms. LuPone has a life -- on a chicken farm in Connecticut -- and that life, as wife and mother, infuses her current show. It is about love in its aspects of, to paraphrase her onstage words, delusion, desperation, lust and, of course, motherhood.</p>
        <p>Her lineage is operatic. Consider her name, after the 19th-century prima donna Adelina Patti. She did a rock act after performances of ''Evita.'' For a movie audition, she sang a Mozart aria. All that in 1980. Twenty years later, she is the femme fatale one minute, ''A Real Emotional Girl,'' the next. But she is playing herself in a show that is inspired by ''the serenity of the home,'' in her words. ''I am a complete person,'' she said. That's who Patti LuPone is.</p>
