        <p>1. Cecil Beaton was best known for his photographs, theatrical sets and costume designs, but he could paint a mean room when he chose, as in this oil painting of the living room at Reddish House, the country manor in Wiltshire that Beaton bought in 1947. Kinsey Marable, the book dealer who once owned the painting, explains that an oil like this is unusual; Beaton usually worked in watercolor.  2. Mark Hampton was one of America's leading decorators until his death in 1998. But he was almost as well known for his charming watercolors, like this one of his Long Island weekend house, published in his 1989 book, ''Mark Hampton on Decorating.'' Here, Hampton illustrates the point that dark colors, contrary to conventional wisdom, can make a country house look, as he wrote, ''cool and shady in summer'' and ''warm and cozy in winter.'' The white moldings and bookcase balance the dark brown walls.</p>
        <p>3. For more than 30 years, from the 1930's through the 1960's, Elizabeth Hoopes did watercolor portraits of rooms decorated by the venerable firm McMillen Inc. Hoopes became known for her ability to render the textures of specific materials -- from the velvet on a chair to the silvery tea paper on a wall -- with color and light. Here, Hoopes illustrates a 1961 room designed by McMillen for Raymond Guest.</p>
        <p>4. Most of the images on these pages depict actual rooms. But this one, a watercolor done by Albert Hadley in 1948, was just an idea -- a project he did as a student at Parsons School of Design. Hadley, now the doyen of American decorators, recalls that the assignment called for designing an apartment in a modern building that combined elements of new and old -- the Louis XV chairs, for example, with the modern Italian Arteluce lamp, which Hadley recalls was popularized in this country by Van Day Truex, the designer who headed Parsons at the time and later became the design director of Tiffany &amp; Company.</p>
        <p>5. Walter Gay (1856-1937) spent much of his career as a painter ''searching for the spirit of empty rooms,'' as he put it. William Rieder's book,A Charmed Couple: The Art and Life of Walter and Matilda Gay,'' to be published this fall, chronicles the life of Gay, his wife and their fellow American expatriates at the turn of the century: Edith Wharton, Henry James and the decorator Elsie de Wolfe. Gay did a number of paintings of de Wolfe's various residences; what's shown here is the drawing room of her New York house, on East 55th Street.</p>
        <p>6. Anna Goth Werner knew that rooms, like people, changed their styles with regularity, so she felt it was ''important to capture them for the future.'' Werner, who died in 1995, painted subjects as diverse as the Temple of Dendur at the Metropolitan Museum and the living room, shown here, of Barbara Jakobson, a collector of 20th-century art and furniture. Werner captured the sensual curves of the Vladimir Kagan sofa and the Noguchi coffee table, as well as the angularity of Gerrit Rietveld's ''Zigzag'' chairs.</p>
        <p>7. Jeremiah Goodman has been illustrating rooms since the late 1940's for publications like Vogue and The New York Times Magazine, for Lord &amp; Taylor and for an illustrious list of designers (Mario Buatta, Billy Baldwin) and homeowners (Sir John Gielgud, Greta Garbo). The room depicted in the gouache painting shown here belonged to the actress Mary Martin, whom Goodman met at a book signing for Dorothy Rodgers, the wife of Richard Rodgers. Dorothy's 1964 book on decorating and entertaining, ''My Favorite Things,'' was illustrated by Goodman. His next projects include getting the apartment of an old friend, the late fashion designer Bonnie Cashin, down on paper. And his work will be shown this fall at an exhibition at Guy Regal Ltd. in New York.</p>
