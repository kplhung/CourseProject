        <p>An old-fashioned crooner, sometimes referred to as Tom Jones-lite, Engelbert Humperdinck is perhaps a bit more hip than one might think. After all, Jimi Hendrix was his opening act in the 1960's and Elvis Presley's look -- the long sideburns and jumpsuit -- came from Mr. Humperdinck. Then there is his ability to fire up female fans, even if they are grandmothers now.</p>
        <p>Mr. Humperdinck reinvented himself by appearing on MTV and by recording an unlikely, humorous track, ''Lesbian Seagull,'' for the 1996 ''Beavis and Butthead Do America'' soundtrack.</p>

        <p>Mr. Humperdinck reinvented himself by appearing on MTV and by recording an unlikely, humorous track, ''Lesbian Seagull,'' for the 1996 ''Beavis and Butthead Do America'' soundtrack.</p>
        <p>Mr. Humperdinck, who appears at the State Theater in New Brunswick on Thursday, recently released a dance-music album, which included an infectious remix of ''Release Me,'' which has been a hit in dance clubs, reaching the Billboard Dance Chart Top 10. Not bad for a square.</p>
