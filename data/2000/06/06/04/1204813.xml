        <p>''So Far, Big Brother Isn't Big Business'' (May 7) may be an accurate reflection of one narrow viewpoint of the online advertising industry, but it fails to see the forest for the trees.</p>
        <p>Most companies that are seriously interested in obtaining ''business intelligence'' about their customers gather information from multiple channels -- including the Internet, offline transactions and the call center -- to retain customers, not attract new ones. Such ''longitudinal'' marketing seeks to extend the most profitable customer relationships not only through new media like personalized Web content and e-mail, but also through good old-fashioned direct mail and telemarketing.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''So Far, Big Brother Isn't Big Business'' (May 7) may be an accurate reflection of one narrow viewpoint of the online advertising industry, but it fails to see the forest for the trees.</p>
        <p>Most companies that are seriously interested in obtaining ''business intelligence'' about their customers gather information from multiple channels -- including the Internet, offline transactions and the call center -- to retain customers, not attract new ones. Such ''longitudinal'' marketing seeks to extend the most profitable customer relationships not only through new media like personalized Web content and e-mail, but also through good old-fashioned direct mail and telemarketing.</p>
        <p>Measuring the results of such targeted data analysis is a challenge, simply because building a comprehensive snapshot of a customer relationship over time and multiple channels is very difficult.</p>
        <p>But suggesting that such techniques are a disappointment overall because banner click-through is declining is a false pairing of a cause and effect.</p>
