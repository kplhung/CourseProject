        <p>To The Editor:</p>
        <p>In his article about Susan Stroman [''These Days, Her Dance Card Is Full,' May 21], Jesse McKinley refers to ''Contact'' as a ''bookless'' musical. This is not the case.</p>
        <p>It is a common misconception that the amount of dialogue in a show reflects the amount of ''book.'' In fact, musical books are about story and structure, what the playwright Terrence McNally has called the architecture of a show. Sometimes that architecture is expressed in substantial nonmusical scenes -- in shows like ''Gypsy'' or ''Parade.'' Sometimes that architecture is expressed almost entirely in music and lyrics -- in shows like ''Rent'' and ''Sweeney Todd.''</p>

Sometimes that architecture is expressed almost entirely in music and lyrics -- in shows like ''Rent'' and ''Sweeney Todd.''</p>
        <p>''Contact'' is made up of three connecting stories, which explore and develop a common theme. It has character development, plot, plot twists and -- although its architecture is expressed largely in dance -- a significant amount of dialogue.</p>
        <p>In short, it has a book. If it did not, it would be an entirely different show.</p>
