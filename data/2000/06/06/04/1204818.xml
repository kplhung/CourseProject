        <p>It was supposed to be a slam-dunk, a bold aggressive play from a politician usually thought of as anything but. Instead, Gov. Gray Davis's proposal to show support for California's public school teachers by exempting them from state income taxes has not gotten anywhere near the hoop.</p>

        <p>It was supposed to be a slam-dunk, a bold aggressive play from a politician usually thought of as anything but. Instead, Gov. Gray Davis's proposal to show support for California's public school teachers by exempting them from state income taxes has not gotten anywhere near the hoop.</p>
        <p>Legislative leaders of both parties in both houses in Sacramento oppose it as bad policy and the start of a slippery slope toward similar demands from other public employees. Even the teachers' unions, initially flattered, oppose the plan, which would reduce the average experienced teacher's state tax by about $1,350 a year. They fear it would leave them open to attacks from fellow government workers, and they prefer salary increases instead.</p>
        <p>So far, about the only ringing endorsement has come from the California Association of Highway Patrolmen, whose president, Mark Muscardini, wrote Mr. Davis last week: ''Yes, we admit that our first reaction was, 'us too.' However, we would simply like to put our own selfish interest aside long enough to express appreciation to the teachers of California.''</p>
        <p>The reaction to the proposal shows the pitfalls when policy innovation meets interest-group politics, along with the enduring difficulty of reaching consensus on how best to address the problems of California's troubled schools, which once led the nation by many measures but have drifted toward the bottom over the last two decades.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis, a Democrat, has repeatedly vowed to make education his top priority, but he had come under increasing fire from fellow Democrats and the state's biggest teachers' union for not moving quickly enough to return California's per-pupil spending on elementary and secondary education to something like the national average. The teacher tax exemption was part of some $3 billion in new spending for education that he proposed in his nearly $100 billion budget for the coming fiscal year.</p>
        <p>Davis aides described the exemption as the first such peacetime tax break for any occupation in American history, and hatched it in greatest secrecy, planning to make a national splash with an announcement in Sunday newspapers last month. It won big national headlines, but a Bronx cheer from the audience of politicians whose support was required to pass it.</p>
        <p>''It's just not a good idea to exempt people from paying taxes based on their profession, because one's favorite is not somebody else's favorite,'' said John Burton, the Democratic president pro tem of the State Senate and an old-line liberal from San Francisco. ''Start with teachers and go to cops and firefighters, go to social workers, go to emergency room docs and news reporters. It's a very slippery slope.''</p>
        <p>Aides to the governor counter that the state tax code is already full of some $14 billion in special expenditures and preferential treatment, for homeowners, the elderly and other groups. Mr. Davis vowed to ''fight for this puppy,'' and his advisers expressed puzzlement that the idea of exempting teachers had fizzled.</p>
        <p>''Apparently, teachers are the only constituency group in California that still wants to pay taxes,'' one state official said dryly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis's communications director, Philip J. Trounstine, said: ''What's appealing about it as an idea is that it makes a bold statement, and the governor still believes this, both throughout the state and across the country, that teaching is an extraordinary profession and deserves extraordinary recognition. And that in the context of a shortage of perhaps 300,000 teachers over the next decade and national competition to attract teachers to California, this was a terrific way to let everyone know that teachers' work was valued here.''</p>
        <p>To which Wayne Johnson, president of the 500,000-member California Teachers Association, the state's largest teachers' union, replied, in essence, thanks but no thanks.</p>
        <p>''We're somewhat uncomfortable in saying, 'We understand you're really trying to help us, but we just don't care much for the idea,' '' Mr. Johnson said. He said a poll of the union's membership found that the measure was opposed by 60 percent, and that when other elements of the proposal were explained (including the fact that teachers' federal taxes would rise because they could no longer deduct state income taxes), opposition rose to 80 percent.</p>
        <p>''The teachers that I'm talking to are saying that if this proposal is going to cost roughly $500 million a year,'' Mr. Johnson said, ''then take the $500 million and put it into the education budget up front and let us bargain for it. They seemed to be far more in favor of that kind of approach. I've heard things like, 'Well this singles us out, it makes us a sacred cow, alienates fire and police and other public employees.' ''</p>
        <p>Then, too, since teachers consistently argue for higher taxes to support public education and finance bonds for school construction, he said, they do not want to be in the position of winning special tax breaks that others could criticize. And because the tax exemption would not constitute a direct expenditure on education, it would not be counted as part of the percentage of state spending that, by law, must be devoted to education.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis can be stubborn, and as the first Democrat to lead the state in 16 years, with partisan majorities in both legislative houses, he has been used to getting his way since taking office last year. Efforts are under way in Sacramento to find some form of compromise that would let the governor claim moral victory while quietly burying his big idea.</p>
        <p>These include proposals from raising starting salaries for teachers to providing tax credits to teachers who buy supplies for school, or making new bonuses tax-free for teachers in schools that improve their academic performance.</p>
        <p>''If we want to value teachers, as we all do, there's a way to do it: give them more money,'' said Mr. Burton, the Senate Democratic leader. ''Increase starting pay, or reimburse them for certain expenses.''</p>
        <p>People familiar with the governor's thinking suggested that he might find some sort of general tax credit for teachers acceptable, perhaps one phased in with rewards based on experience.</p>
        <p>State Senator Jack O'Connell, a Democrat and former social studies teacher from San Luis Obispo on the central coast, sponsored a bill that passed the Senate this week, aimed at increasing starting teacher salaries to about $38,000 a year, from the present range of $26,000 to $32,000. It would reimburse districts that raise starting salaries, and would cost about $325 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Connell said he thought that the governor was willing to entertain various ways of achieving his goal of attracting and retaining teachers.</p>
        <p>''I think the governor is totally wedded to the idea of making teaching more attractive,'' he said. ''I just don't believe he is wedded to any one particular concept. He's a bottom-line guy.''</p>
