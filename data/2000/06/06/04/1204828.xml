        <p>The 1.2 million college graduates in the nation's class of 2000 are entering an unusually strong job market that is a result of a flourishing economy and, especially, the boom in high technology.</p>
        <p>From Northeastern University in Boston to the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, from the University of Michigan to the University of Texas, colleges, universities and professional schools are reporting a record number of recruiters competing to hire students in a time of low unemployment.</p>
        <p>Engineering students from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and other universities in the East have been flown to Silicon Valley and Seattle for audiences with billionaire executives, while investment banks have flown Stanford University students to New York for high-priced dinners accompanied by job offers.</p>
        <p>Some of the graduates have landed jobs paying more than $60,000 a year. With unemployment near its lowest level in three decades, despite the increase in unemployment announced on Friday, salaries overall for this year's graduating class are up 6 percent over last year's, job placement experts say.</p>
        <p>''It's gangbusters,'' said Carol S. Lyons, dean of the department of career services at Northeastern University. ''There are even more jobs  now than last year. Obviously the hot market is high-tech, but if you're any kind of a business major, you're in fine shape. And even if you're a liberal arts major there are plenty of opportunities.''</p>
        <p>But those in computer sciences are doing best of all. Many technology companies are offering signing bonuses of $5,000, with stock options often added on top. One graduate of  the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., has taken an $82,000-a-year job in Silicon Valley.</p>
        <p>This year's computer science graduates have landed jobs averaging $48,500, while graduates in accounting average $37,200 and liberal arts graduates, $29,100, according to the National Association of Colleges and Employers, which represents employers and college job placement officers.</p>
        <p>Emily Lowe, a senior at Stanford University who majored in product design engineering with a minor in computer science, said she will earn about $60,000 next year with a software company in San Diego, and that is before the $5,000 signing bonus and stock options.</p>
        <p>''I had five job offers, including one from a company in Arizona that agreed to fly me to San Diego every weekend to visit my fiance,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But some university officials see troubles behind this bright picture. A smaller percentage of students from this year's graduating class is planning to go to graduate school. At Columbia University, administrators say, about 20 percent of this year's graduating seniors said they would attend graduate school next year, down from a high of 70 percent in decades past, usually during recessions. This trend makes many college officials fear that a smaller, and possibly less capable, group will choose to become professors.</p>
        <p>Another problem, university officials say, is that at a time when educators and government officials see an acute need for more -- and more talented -- teachers, the lavish starting salaries offered by the private sector are drawing away potential teachers.</p>
        <p>''The problem isn't so much the high-tech salaries, but the level of teacher salaries,'' said Stanley O. Ikenberry, president of the American Council on Education, an association of 3,500 colleges and universities. ''Can you imagine a high school teacher of physics or mathematics receiving a paycheck that might be $25,000 a year, as opposed to the $50,000 or $75,000 in a comparable role in business? It's a tough choice for a young person to make.''</p>
        <p>Some college officials say a bidding war between technology companies, investment banks and consulting firms has pushed salary offers to record levels, with average salaries jumping nearly 20 percent from three years ago.</p>
        <p>In one unusual episode, several Columbia University students who had accepted $45,000-a-year jobs from a New York bank were delighted this spring when the bank, fearing it would lose them to competitors, announced that it was raising their starting salaries to $55,000.</p>
        <p>''It looks as if the starting salaries for this year's college graduates are the same as that M.B.A.'s were receiving seven years ago,'' said Margaret O'Hara, a senior consultant with the Hanigan Consulting Group, which advises scores of companies on hiring college graduates. ''What's happened in the past few years is we've gone from being employer-centric to being employee-centric.''</p>
        <p>At Northeastern University this year, there were 440 job recruiters, up from 400 the year before. At the University of Michigan, 170 employers made presentations selling themselves to students, up from 120 last  year.</p>
        <p>''There are just too many employers chasing too few students,'' said Patricia Rose, director of career services at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p>Frustrated that there are not enough qualified college graduates, many high-technology companies have pressed President Clinton to nearly double, to 200,000, the number of annual visas for skilled foreign workers.</p>
        <p>University officials say the high demand for skilled workers has created improper dealings. Some companies, eager to catch their prey, have made what are called ''exploding offers'' -- students are told they have 24 hours to accept a job offer or the offer disappears.</p>
        <p>Pressured by such offers, students accept and, after continuing to look or after stumbling upon something more attractive, a few renege on those offers and take other jobs.</p>
        <p>''There are some downsides to this wonderful market,'' said Robert Thirsk, director of career development services at Stanford University. ''Exploding offers put students in a very precarious position. We tell these companies, 'You put the student in a difficult situation of having to make a decision like that. What do you think they're going to do?' When students renege on offers, it's usually because they haven't been given enough time to think about it.''</p>
        <p>Stanford has told employers that beginning this fall companies that recruit on campus must give students at least three weeks to respond to job offers.</p>
        <p>The giddy job situation at colleges is giddier yet at business schools. There, $25,000 signing bonuses are common, and some companies fly not just prospective employees, but their spouses, cross-country.</p>
        <p>Erin Cochrane, director of career services at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth, said the average base salary for this year's M.B.A. graduates is $90,000, up from $80,000 last year. She said overall median first-year compensation is actually $135,000, after adding in signing bonuses, a guaranteed first-year bonus and employers' paying a student's second-year business school tuition.</p>
