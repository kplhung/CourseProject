        <p>LIVINGSTON  130 Artists Who Thought Figuratively</p>
        <p>The broad range of 20th-century paintings of the human figure are explored at ''The Figure: Another Side of Modernism,'' which opens today at the Newhouse Center of the Snug Harbor Cultural Center.</p>
        <p>The 130 figurative paintings, each by a different artist, span the last 50 years, tracing an evolution that reveals shifts in media and technology as well as cultural attitudes, regional styles and artistic sensibilities. Lilly Wei, a curator, critic and writer, was curator of the exhibition, which opens with a work by Willem de Kooning, because of his importance in abstract figure painting.</p>
        <p>The exhibition will be accompanied by tours, gallery talks with participating artists, panel discussions with scholars and artists and family days with art-making activities for children.</p>
        <p>''The Figure: Another Side of Modernism,'' today through Jan. 14, 2001;  Wednesday through Sunday, noon to 5 p.m.; Snug Harbor Cultural Center, 1000 Richmond Terrace, near Snug Harbor Road, Staten Island; $2 suggested donation; (718) 448-2500.</p>
        <p>LOWER MANHATTAN  Songs of the Sea, In Appropriate Setting</p>
        <p>Tuesday evenings in June at the South Street Seaport, Lower Manhattan becomes a backdrop, the Brooklyn Bridge a frame, the East River a theater and the four-masted Peking (below) a stage. The transformation takes place for ''Sea Music Concert,'' four maritime music performances that commemorate sailors and the sea chanteys they sang while at work.</p>
        <p>The New York Packet, the South Street Seaport's maritime museum group, starts the series on Tuesday  with chanteys and songs from America's inland waterways and deep-water ports.</p>
        <p>Dan Milner and Bob Conroy join the New York Packet on June 13 for songs of Irish immigrants and sailors. David Jones of London brings English music hall songs and comic and tragic pieces from the Royal Navy on June 20. And, on June 27, the Windlasses, a mother and two daughters, join the New York Packet for contemporary and traditional maritime music.</p>
        <p>The concert is presented by the South Street Seaport Museum and co-sponsored by the Folk Music Society of New York.</p>
        <p>''Sea Music Concert,'' Tuesdays in June, 6 p.m.; at Pier 16 at the South Street Seaport (Fulton Street and the East River); $3 admission donation; (212) 748-8600.</p>
        <p>LONG ISLAND CITY  Beneath the Surface, Far From Home</p>
        <p>Depth, displacement and burial are the themes of ''Once Removed,'' the Socrates Sculpture Park's Summer 2000 exhibition, which opens today.</p>
        <p>The works include Tom Kotik's ''Buried Treasure,'' a buried brownstone that is a replica of the top four feet of the Brooklyn town house in which he grew up. Claire Lesteven has transformed an old New York City water tower into a pinhole camera, and Eliza Proctor has installed  40 coffee cups on steel rods at varying depths in the East River.</p>
        <p>Brad McCullum is exhibiting 36 of the 228 manhole covers he made for a project in Hartford in which guns confiscated by the police department were melted down and recast.</p>
        <p>The 10 new sculptures bring the park's total to 33; among the holdovers ''The Gaelic Boat'' (below), a  1999 work by Kellie Murphy, who described it as a cartoonlike form.</p>
        <p>Live musical performances from Dopamine, a Brooklyn-based rock band, Fhs Trio, a jazz ensemble, and Jen Chapin, a blues-folk band, celebrate today's opening from 2 to 6 p.m.</p>
        <p>''Once Removed,'' opening celebration today 2 p.m. to 6 p.m., exhibition through Sept. 1, 10 a.m. to sunset; at the intersection of Broadway and Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens; free; 718-956-1819.</p>
