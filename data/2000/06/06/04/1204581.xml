        <p>For the second year in a row we have chosen the annual Tony Awards as a perfect opportunity to point to and make fun of the seemingly endless trends of racism and sexism in American theater.</p>
        <p>As an anonymous, collaborative group of women artists, writers, performers, filmmakers and art professionals who began in 1985 by attacking the art world, we turned our sights to theater in 1997 mainly because no one seemed to be talking about the fact that fewer than 18 percent of all plays produced in the United States were written by women or artists of color.</p>

        <p>For the second year in a row we have chosen the annual Tony Awards as a perfect opportunity to point to and make fun of the seemingly endless trends of racism and sexism in American theater.</p>
        <p>As an anonymous, collaborative group of women artists, writers, performers, filmmakers and art professionals who began in 1985 by attacking the art world, we turned our sights to theater in 1997 mainly because no one seemed to be talking about the fact that fewer than 18 percent of all plays produced in the United States were written by women or artists of color.</p>
        <p>Since 1947 more than 100 Tonys have gone to Broadway directors. Only one has gone to a woman for directing a play (Garry Hynes) and one to a woman for directing a musical (Julie Taymor). Three people of color have won Tonys for directing a play (Jose Ferrer, Lloyd Richards and George C. Wolfe) and two for directing a musical (Geoffrey Holder and Mr. Wolfe).</p>
        <p>What's wrong with the Tonys is what's wrong with Broadway. Without the vision of women and artists of color, audiences are seeing only the first act of the show.</p>
