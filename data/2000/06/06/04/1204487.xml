        <p>A sharp knife in a skilled hand is a scary thing. The best cooks do not simply use knives. They allow knives to become their hands.</p>
        <p>I fought it for years. Proficient with French knives, I was in the habit of using different blades for different tasks. But maintaining and nurturing all those blades hampered a close personal relationship with any single one.</p>
        <p>And then a cleaver came into my life.</p>
        <p>Like any French-trained cook, I had assumed that cleavers were created solely to hack bones. However misinformed, I was mesmerized watching Asian chefs use them. I was awestruck by their surgical precision, how they used each part of the cleaver for a different purpose. I was intrigued by the amount of skill required to sculpture a fine filigree of vegetables using a heavy hunk of steel with a bevel as broad-edged as an ax.</p>
        <p>Later I learned that it wasn't the cooks, it was the cleavers. The Western-style or butcher's cleaver, with a blade that's typically six to eight inches long, three to four inches wide and up to a quarter-inch thick, is a hacker, and only a hacker.</p>
        <p>The Chinese-style cleaver, with a blade that's typically seven inches long, four inches wide and a quarter to a sixteenth of an inch thick, is an all-purpose knife. Its razor-thin bevel can chop or slice or dice. Its broad edge can smash garlic or lemongrass. Its nub-end handle can be used as a pestle. Its entire blade can double as a spatula.</p>
        <p>Cleavers, like knives, become extensions of the cooks who use them. Shirley Cheng, a professor of culinary arts at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y., waves off my wonderment at how her cleaver whooshes like a mechanical blade, rending daikon, carrots and peppers thin as parchment.</p>
        <p>Cheng was trained in the cleaver's art at the Sichuan Culinary Institute in China. ''You learned control,'' she says, ''by cutting stuff for 10 hours a day for two years.'' Cleaver cooking is seamless, like the balletic movement of a martial-arts kata. The lightness of the cleaver gives it less inherent physical force than a traditional knife.</p>
        <p>A cook either exerts or becomes strategic, as Prince Huei's chef did in ''The Cooks' Catalogue'' (Harper &amp; Row Publishers, 1975): ''Every blow of his hand, every heave of his shoulders, every tread of his foot, every thrust of his knee, every whshh of rent flesh, every chhk of the chopper was in perfect rhythm,'' yet his cleaver remained gleaming as new.</p>
        <p>''A good cook changes his chopper once a year -- because he cuts,'' the cook tells the prince. ''An ordinary cook once a month -- because he hacks. But I have had this chopper for 19 years.''</p>
        <p>It is, after all, his only tool. And so he has learned the interstices, the soft spots, the way through any task that is easiest on his cleaver.</p>
        <p>''Bravo!'' cried the prince. ''From the words of this cook I have learnt how to take care of my life.''</p>
        <p>Cleaver-to-Wok  Coq au Vin</p>
        <p>1 whole chicken (about 4 pounds)  Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</p>
        <p>1/2 cup all-purpose flour  9 tablespoons vegetable oil  4 ounces sliced bacon, finely chopped  2 Spanish onions, thinly sliced  3 cloves garlic, minced  2 cups red wine  1 bay leaf  1 small package white button mushrooms (about 10 ounces), thinly sliced  1 tablespoon unsalted butter.</p>
        <p>1. Place the chicken on a cutting board breast-side up. Using a heavy cleaver, cut off the whole legs. Then at the joint cut the drumsticks from the thighs. Set aside. Chop off the wings and discard or save for another use. Turn the chicken over. Cut down either side of the backbone and discard the backbone. Cut through the sternum, cutting the chicken in half. Cut each breast piece in half widthwise, making 4 pieces.</p>
        <p>2. Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Place the flour on a plate and coat the chicken with it.</p>
        <p>3. In a large wok, over medium heat, heat 1 tablespoon oil. Add bacon and cook, stirring, until crisp, about 1 minute. Transfer bacon to a paper-towel-lined plate. Discard the bacon fat.</p>
        <p>4. Raise the heat to high. Heat 2 tablespoons oil and add half the chicken to the wok. Brown on both sides, about 1 minute per side. Set aside. Drain the oil from the wok. Repeat with the remaining chicken and 2 tablespoons oil. Add onions and cook, stirring, until soft and brown, about 6 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Return the chicken to the wok and add the red wine and bay leaf and bring to a boil. Cover the wok, lower the heat and simmer until the chicken is very tender, about 30 minutes.</p>
        <p>5. In a large skillet, over high heat, heat 2 tablespoons oil. Add half the mushrooms. Cook, stirring occasionally, until browned, about 3 minutes. Set aside. Repeat with remaining oil and mushrooms.</p>
        <p>6. Remove the wok from the heat and swirl the butter into the sauces in the pan. Transfer to a serving platter and cover with bacon and mushrooms. Serve immediately.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 servings.</p>
        <p>Chinese Pepper Steak  (Adapted from ''The Chinese Kitchen,'' by Eileen Yin-Fei Lo, William Morrow &amp; Co., 1999)</p>
        <p>For the marinade:  2 teaspoons oyster sauce (see note)  1 teaspoon sesame oil</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon peeled, minced ginger  1 1/2 teaspoons Shao-Hsing wine (see note) or dry sherry</p>
        <p>3/4 teaspoon dark soy sauce</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt  1 teaspoon sugar  1 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch  Pinch freshly ground white pepper</p>
        <p>3/4 pound London broil, cut into 1-inch cubes</p>
        <p>For the sauce:  2 teaspoons oyster sauce  1 teaspoon sesame oil  1 teaspoon dark soy sauce  1 teaspoon sugar  2 teaspoons cornstarch  Pinch freshly ground white pepper</p>
        <p>1/2 cup chicken stock</p>
        <p>For the black-bean paste:  2 large garlic cloves, smashed with the flat side of a cleaver and peeled  2 tablespoons fermented black beans (see note), washed and rinsed</p>
        <p>For the stir-fry:  3 tablespoons peanut oil  1 tablespoon peeled, minced ginger  1 medium green bell pepper, seeded and cut into 1-inch pieces  1 medium red bell pepper, seeded and cut into 1-inch pieces  Cooked rice for serving.</p>
        <p>1. Make the marinade. In a large bowl, whisk together all the marinade ingredients except the London broil. Then add the London broil and set aside at room temperature for 30 minutes.</p>
        <p>2. Make the sauce. In a small bowl, whisk together the sauce ingredients and set aside.</p>
        <p>3. Make the bean paste. In a large bowl, combine the garlic and black beans. Carefully grip the back of a cleaver and, using the handle like a pestle, work the garlic and beans into a smooth paste. Set aside.</p>
        <p>4. Make the stir-fry. In large wok, over high heat, heat 1 tablespoon oil. When the oil is smoking, add ginger and cook, stirring, until light brown, about 20 seconds. Add peppers and cook, stirring, until slightly tender, about 1 minute more. Transfer peppers to a bowl and set aside. Wipe out the wok, add the 2 remaining tablespoons oil and return it to the heat. When the oil is smoking, add the bean paste and cook, stirring, until light brown, about 20 seconds. Add the beef with the marinade, spread into an even layer and cook, tipping the wok back and forth, 1 minute. Turn the beef over and cook until brown, about 30 seconds more. Add the peppers and cook, stirring, until very tender, about 2 minutes. Push beef and peppers to the sides of the wok to form a well in the center. Pour the sauce mixture into the well and cook, stirring, until the liquid thickens and turns dark brown, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a platter and serve with rice.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 servings.  note: Available at Asian markets or by mail order from Adriana's Caravan, (800) 316-0820.</p>
