        <p>WHAT gardener does not like to grow plants that are easy to care for? Of course, as anyone worth a trowel or spade knows, there is no such thing as a no-care plant. Yet there are a few perennials that require less maintenance than some. At least that is what I have found.</p>
        <p>A particular favorite of mine, because I have quite a bit of shade, is astilbe. This excellent perennial with its upright, feathery plumes is a stalwart. The plumes appear sometime in late May or early June and seem to last for several weeks. In between, the foliage has an elegance that makes these plants superb additions.</p>

        <p>WHAT gardener does not like to grow plants that are easy to care for? Of course, as anyone worth a trowel or spade knows, there is no such thing as a no-care plant. Yet there are a few perennials that require less maintenance than some. At least that is what I have found.</p>
        <p>A particular favorite of mine, because I have quite a bit of shade, is astilbe. This excellent perennial with its upright, feathery plumes is a stalwart. The plumes appear sometime in late May or early June and seem to last for several weeks. In between, the foliage has an elegance that makes these plants superb additions.</p>
        <p>The astilbes are not big plants, so they should be set where this elegance shows off. Also, they abhor full sun and thrive where they have some shelter from beating hot sun rays.</p>
        <p>One essential: Astilbes are one of the first plants to succumb in hot dry spells, if they are not watered deeply.</p>
        <p>Along with the showy astilbes, another handsome perennial is heuchera, or, as some may know it, coral bells. This is the perennial with the tall, skinny rows of tiny bells when in bloom. But for summerlong display, it is the heuchera foliage that counts. Be sure to cut off the blooms as soon as they fade. I forgot to do this one summer and the browned stalks of the plants poked up and looked ugly.</p>
        <p>Coreopsis came to fame several years ago with the cultivar Moonbeam. It was the must-have perennial for many seasons. Then another rival cultivar called Zagreb, which is a bit shorter in stature, vied with Moonbeam for garden space.</p>
        <p>Either one of the tickseeds, as they are commonly called, suits the easy-care perennial category. The bloom season seems to go on for several weeks in the summer, showing off bright little yellow daisies. When the flowers fade, cut the plants back hard. You can be quite ruthless. In no time, new growth appears and the plants bloom again in the early fall.</p>
        <p>Possibly one reason why so many gardeners have become discouraged with coreopsis is this forgetfulness to cut the plants back after first bloom. Another problem, this perennial spreads easily and needs to be divided every few years. But for its steadfastness, coreopsis is hard to beat.</p>
        <p>Of all the perennials, hostas need the least care. Plant hostas, and they are a forever perennial. In fact, they become so huge sometimes, that they must be divided.</p>
        <p>Some gardeners give hostas great garden space. I do. Others avoid planting them. Those who have deer problems have learned to skip this perennial because for deer, hostas  make a splendid salad.</p>
        <p>But where some color is needed, particularly in deep shady nooks, there are hostas to suit almost every need. They come in all sizes and in all shades of green and gold so they can be set for dramatic blends of color. In August when they bloom, their beauty is even more special.</p>
        <p>The dear old black-eyed Susans have gained huge popularity with the advent of the German cultivar Goldsturm. This stalwart of the back border blooms unabated from late summer until frost. The golden daisies waft gently in a soft breeze.</p>
        <p>When this plant is set in large sections of a border, it becomes a  dramatic display.</p>
        <p>The Perennial Plant Association was so taken with this particular perennial, last year it chose Goldsturm as their plant of the year.</p>
        <p>The tall elegant phlox was the mainstay of perennial borders for many years but fell out of favor because it succumbed to the fungal disease mildew. Discouragement set in and few gardeners included the tall stately phlox paniculata in their gardens. This was the story until the advent of the phlox cultivar David.  This white-flowered cultivar is quite fragrant and best of all, prominently mildew resistant. This is a big plant, up to 3 feet tall, and it needs space toward the back of the border.</p>
        <p>Even more intriguing than the phlox cultivar David, is its elegant sport, called Shortwood, a pink flowered cultivar with a deeper pink eye.  When this one flowered last summer, it was love at first sight. One important chore with both of these phlox cultivars is to deadhead (snap or cut off the faded flowers) them promptly after bloom. This will prevent the phlox plants from forming seed and encourage their root systems to strengthen. The plants should be divided every three to four years. Otherwise the perennial clump reverts to a disappointing mass of foliage with meager blooms.</p>
        <p>Finally, easy-care does not mean ignore. Provide perennials with a substantial amount of fertilizer now as the growing season is underway. And if there are prolonged summer droughts, try to water.</p>
        <p>This year there are a couple of new varieties of coreopsis grandiflora, the yellow, large-flowered coreopsis species. Early Sunrise has fluffier flower heads than other varieties because its blooms are semi-double (more petals per bloom). Another cultivar, Robin, was developed in Germany, and combines shorter stems with larger blossoms. Robin also features a dark red ring near the center of each flower.</p>
