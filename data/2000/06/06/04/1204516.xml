        <p>THE Mattatuck Museum in Waterbury is showing off a gift: 48 paintings given to it last year by Mrs. Thaler Cohen of New York City. Mrs. Cohen, who owns an art gallery in Manhattan, wanted to give the works to a Connecticut museum because her son, Fred Thaler, lives in Kent. That modest reason has yielded the Mattatuck many illuminating paintings from the 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>
        <p>The gift is presented as ''A Touch of Light: American Tonalist Masters.'' One might quibble about the title, especially since the term Tonalism has only recently come into relatively wide usage, and its meaning is still rather loose. Several encounters with shows presented as Tonalist have produced a rough definition. Essentially it means that the colors making up a painting are in the same range.</p>

        <p>THE Mattatuck Museum in Waterbury is showing off a gift: 48 paintings given to it last year by Mrs. Thaler Cohen of New York City. Mrs. Cohen, who owns an art gallery in Manhattan, wanted to give the works to a Connecticut museum because her son, Fred Thaler, lives in Kent. That modest reason has yielded the Mattatuck many illuminating paintings from the 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>
        <p>The gift is presented as ''A Touch of Light: American Tonalist Masters.'' One might quibble about the title, especially since the term Tonalism has only recently come into relatively wide usage, and its meaning is still rather loose. Several encounters with shows presented as Tonalist have produced a rough definition. Essentially it means that the colors making up a painting are in the same range.</p>
        <p>Pronounced contrasts between light and dark are absent (think Whistler). Going against that definition, some of the paintings here depend on a sharp division between light and dark areas. But the ''touch of light'' part of the title is everywhere in evidence. Part of the pleasure of the exhibition lies in discovering the various sources of light: natural, reflected, or perhaps even spiritual.</p>
        <p>The dominant genre is, not surprisingly, landscape, and the examples in the show therefore would slip easily into the holdings of any Connecticut museum with a historical outlook.</p>
        <p>J. Alden Weir is almost ubiquitous in Connecticut this summer; this gift adds one more of his works, featuring rolling meadows, most likely painted at his farm, now a national park. Bruce Crane, identified with the art colony at Old Lyme, is a clear example of what is commonly meant by Tonalism. In his maturity he specialized in fall and winter scenes and ''Connecticut Woods'' has a dominant butterscotch tonality.</p>
        <p>George Inness, as the last major Hudson River School painter, transcends categories. His style changed several times in the course of his career, but ''Back of My Studio: Milton on the Hudson'' comes close to textbook Tonalism. It is an intriguing study in different shades of green, something that might be boring in other hands.</p>
        <p>Albert Bierstadt is usually associated with grand, theatrical scenery of the American West. But he also managed to create drama on a small scale. ''Western Lake'' painted in Nebraska, is distinguished by a hole in the evening sky filled with light. The shape of the break in the sky echoes that of the lake.</p>
        <p>The enigmatic Ralph Blakelock exemplifies the Romantic spirit in 19th-century American painting, and he always accomplished this on an especially small scale. The eponymous ''Indian and Papoose,'' are distant, indefinable figures in the small painting, and merge with the trees.</p>
        <p>Another landscape with figure is ''Walking Down the Path,'' by the symbolist Elihu Vedder, who usually can be counted on for strangeness. The female figure clearly rendered and coming toward the viewer is swaddled in cloth, in a way reminiscent of Middle Eastern dress. The verdant landscape, however, is probably European (Vedder spent most of his life in Europe).</p>
        <p>A couple of European surprises include a still life by Henri Fantin-Latour, best known for large-scale group portraits of his friends, many of whom were avant-garde artists. The still life here is a meticulously painted grouping of fruits.</p>
        <p>Thomas Couture taught Manet among others, and the Thaler gift includes a poignant horse's head in profile. John Singer Sargent straddled Europe and America and is represented by a double-sided work. Only ''Courtyard in Venice'' is visible. The work might have been exhibited in a free-standing fashion with both sides visible, but then ''Venetian Canal'' would be upside down.</p>
        <p>There is a winter landscape, ''Snow Scene,'' by Ernest Lawson, who specialized in laying on white pigment thickly, to evoke snow on the ground. The collection and exhibition, however, are often refreshing when a painting goes against the show's usual landscape grain. Guy Wiggins chose winter in the city as his subject; ''The Blizzard at the Library'' pulls out all the stops to capture the harshness of the weather, but in keeping with the exhibition's general theme the white stuff is luminous.</p>
        <p>Some of the most intriguing paintings are set indoors. Everett Shinn was (as was Lawson) a member of The Eight, a group of painters who succeeded the Ash Can School in resolute depiction of urban life. Shinn's ''Singer,'' who is on stage, is reminiscent of those depicted by Degas or Lautrec. The footlights provide the illumination. Alexander Brook's ''Draped with a Towel'' could just as well be a daring entertainer; Brook provides a bare background, which might just as swell be a stage for the lone figure.</p>
        <p>David Burliuk was a Russian-born artist who mastered avant-garde abstraction before he came to the United States in 1922. Most of his American paintings are realistic, but extend into a kind of surrealism. ''Family at Tea'' has what the museum notes call ''Gnome-like figures,'' including the artist himself, sitting down to tea Russian style. The main light comes through an open window and glints off the samovar.</p>
        <p>An ordinary copper kettle figures in Soren Emil Carlsen's spare yet strange still life. There is a touch of light on the kettle, but it is overshadowed by the dazzling white belly of the fish posed in front of it.</p>
        <p>''A Touch of Light'' is at the Mattatuck Museum in Waterbury through June 30.</p>
