        <p>About 900 marchers, some from as far away as San Francisco, paraded through Chinatown yesterday to honor Chinese-Americans who served in the United States military.</p>
        <p>The parade commemorated the 50th anniversary of the start of the Korean War, with veterans of that conflict marching near the front. It also celebrated the 55th anniversary of the founding of Chinatown's American Legion post.</p>
        <p>The marchers, following dancing dragons and skirling bagpipes, started at Columbus Park on Mulberry Street in the We Serve With Pride Parade, which was organized by the Lt. B. R. Kimlau Chinese Memorial Post 1291 of the American Legion.</p>
        <p>The Kimlau Post, which claims to be the largest Chinese-American post of the American Legion, was named after a World War II bombardier who was killed near New Guinea. It has about 600 members from the New York metropolitan area.</p>
        <p>The marchers headed up Mulberry Street to Canal Street, then past a reviewing stand near the Chinese-American Veterans' War Memorial in Chatham Square, where new officers were installed. A banquet was to follow, with a private screening of a movie called ''We Served With Pride.''</p>
        <p>Montgomery Hom, the producer and director of the film, was the parade's grand marshal, dressed in his uncle's World War II paratrooper's uniform.</p>
        <p>''I want to salute the greatest generation, who saved the world: World War II veterans,'' he told the crowd at the memorial. ''I have spent the last 20 years researching the exploits of Chinese-Americans in the war, and I am proud to say that, finally, Chinese-American veterans will have their legacy.''</p>
        <p>Raymond Chu, a member of Post 1291 who lives in New Hyde Park, N.Y., and who fought on Okinawa in World War II, said he marched to show his continuing patriotism.</p>
