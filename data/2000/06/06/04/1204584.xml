        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The Unified Bulk Program is in all respects the most sweeping change in New York City's zoning in the past four decades. It has the capacity to transform our city by defining new criteria for the way that we build.</p>
        <p>The new proposal is greatly simplified in comparison to the current 1961 Zoning Resolution and in most respects has been substantially improved.

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The Unified Bulk Program is in all respects the most sweeping change in New York City's zoning in the past four decades. It has the capacity to transform our city by defining new criteria for the way that we build.</p>
        <p>The new proposal is greatly simplified in comparison to the current 1961 Zoning Resolution and in most respects has been substantially improved. The New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects has been an active force throughout the long rewriting process, working with Joseph B. Rose, his staff and the Planning Commission to hone and redefine the proposal.</p>
        <p>We must remember that it is good zoning that separates a well-planned city from chaos. One only has to look at the over-building of Southeast Asia, not to mention Houston, to see what is possible in a lapse of controls. In New York, we are looking to zoning to show us guidelines for building -- not solutions. Our work is to find the balance between context and the unique expression of each building. We agree that architects need to have the creative leeway to design buildings that are innovative, but they also must respond to civic and street issues, and at the same time provide our clients with well-built, safe, programmatically successful spaces for work or living.</p>
        <p>The essence of New York is context -- the character of our neighorhoods. While we agree with Herbert Muschamp [''Reaching for Power Over Streets and Sky,'' May 14] that freedom is an important component of design, in this city of eight million there needs to be some predictability as to the bulk and mass of what can be built. At present, the ''as-of-right'' building is not necessarily the best solution. The Advisory Design Panel included in the Rose proposal could help to mitigate the disparity between the as-of-right and the non-as-of-right processes and thereby improve the opportunities for design excellence. We think it is worth a try.</p>
        <p>We urge everyone to join our efforts and responsibly work with the Planning Commission on this tremendous and potentially powerful new Unified Bulk Program. The quality of the built environment of New York in the upcoming centuries is at stake.</p>
