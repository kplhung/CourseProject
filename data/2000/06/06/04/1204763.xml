        <p>A HOT new issue is lurking just below the political radar, ready to explode onto the American electorate.</p>
        <p>''It tests off the charts!'' said Neil Newhouse, a Republican pollster.</p>
        <p>Mark Penn, President Clinton's pollster, said, ''Everybody's seen it in their surveys -- it's pretty hard to miss. It's a pretty powerful groundswell.''</p>
        <p>Senator Richard Durbin, an Illinois Democrat who held three hearings on the subject last week, gushed, ''Boy, you prompt it with just a couple words and you're going to get a torrent of responses from people.''</p>
        <p>The issue is privacy. It encompasses far more than peeping toms, or even hackers invading Web sites or intercepting cell phone conversations. Not only are people frightened that information about their personal peccadillos could turn up in hostile hands, but also that thieves could cash in on their financial data.</p>
        <p>Increasingly, people confess to pollsters, they are suspicious of companies that have access to their financial and health care records, and are frightened that the information will be used against them. They are no less wary of what the government could do with such data.</p>
        <p>To many voters, that their movements and activities are being tracked on the Internet -- perhaps even by their bosses -- may not pose a direct danger. But the very idea of it is, well, creepy.</p>
        <p>Spotting an opportunity, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush have  begun speaking out about protecting the dissemination of private information.</p>
        <p>''Today, there is greater protection for your video rental receipts than for your most intimate medical information,'' Mr. Gore said in a speech at New York University two weeks ago. ''I've seen cases where people's prescription drug histories are sold freely to direct mail companies without their permission; where hundreds of employees at an H.M.O. have access to patients' records.''</p>
        <p>Even Mr. Bush offered a nod, telling Business Week recently, ''I'm a privacy-rights person. The marketplace can function without sacrificing the privacy of individuals.''</p>
        <p>In many ways, privacy seems like a sure-fire political issue: it touches day-to-day anxieties triggered when people are asked to divulge their credit card number over the telephone or when they retrieve cash from an A.T.M. machine. It is always a draw for press coverage. And as Internet useburgeons, so will fears.</p>
        <p>But politicians face a challenge to convert privacy from a subliminal worry to something that will actually affect how people vote. Complicating that challenge,privacy is not, at first glance, a matter that would drive voters to one party or another.</p>
        <p>DEMOCRATS have been the most aggressive in vying for the privacy niche. They are framing it as a tension between civil libertarians and consumers on one side and big business on the other. Already, in the House, Democrats have zeroed in on a vote taken last July, in which most Republicans opposed instituting rigorous privacy protection for customers' medical and financial records.</p>
        <p>Although privacy comes up less among Republicans, they argue that it would not be out of character for them to seize the issue. After all, libertarians have always been big on privacy. And Republicans were the most outspoken in condemning the Census Bureau's long form, asserting that it was an infringement on privacy.</p>
        <p>''This is a hill that nobody holds, and either party could seize the ground,'' said Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster who for months has been using flip charts to persuade his clients that privacy ''is a huge issue waiting'' for someone to grab. ''The issue of privacy is very much in the place that health care was a decade or so ago,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Acknowledging that either party could potentially become identified with privacy, Mr. Newhouse said the competition will be over who ''can be there first and strongest and be the noisiest on it.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, a Gallup poll in March asked who would better handle protecting ordinary Americans against invasions of privacy. Mr. Gore drew 41 percent; Mr. Bush, 47 percent.</p>
        <p>Privacy may be so potentially hot that some candidates did not want to publicly admit they were husbanding the issue for their fall arsenals. Who wants to tip off a rival to a fresh line of attack?</p>
        <p>''My campaigns are reluctant about showing leg early on this,'' said Jim Jordan, political director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.</p>
        <p>But candidates who face primary opponents do not have the luxury of holding off. Last week, former Representative Maria Cantwell, who is running for the Democratic Senate nomination from Washington state, began broadcasting a television commercial on privacy. Ms. Cantwell, who lost her seat after one term in the Gingrich revolution of 1994, went on to make between $25 million and $50 million in the Internet business.</p>
        <p>Peering into the camera, Ms. Cantwell says in the 30-second spot: ''What you do on your own computer should be your business and nobody else's. I want to make sure no child is left behind and that the Internet remains a tool for learning, not another way for government, banks or insurance companies to invade your privacy.''</p>
        <p>The campaign of another Democrat, Mike Ciresi, a trial lawyer who is seeking the Senate nomination from Minnesota, swamped potential supporters last week with thousands of glossy brochures featuring the headline, ''Mike Ciresi Will Protect Your Privacy!''</p>
        <p>When voters are asked what concerns them most, they seldom cite privacy right off the bat. Yet pollsters find that when voters are probed about issues that affect their lives, privacy shoots to the top -- or close to it.</p>
        <p>''God gave me a couple of ears -- I just listen to people,'' said Brian Schweitzer, a peppermint farmer and soil scientist from Whitefish, Mont., who is running for the United States Senate. ''Everywhere I go in Montana people want to protect their privacy. It's huge!''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schweitzer, a Democrat who hopes to oust Senator Conrad Burns, accused his rival of co-sponsoring a bill that ''would force the individual consumer to contact corporate America and beg them not to collate and sell your personal information.''</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Burns insisted that Mr. Schweitzer ''mischaracterized the legislation'' and was simply ''trying to get his name in the paper.'' He is just as committed, he said, to guarding people's privacy.</p>
        <p>No one knows whether this issue will truly rouse voters in the fall of 2000 to the same extent as health care and education. After all, even after the tax revolt of 1978 in California, it took years for cutting taxes to become a winning issue nationally. And despite stirrings about smog and dirty water in the 1970's, the environment did not emerge as a top-of-the-mind concern of American voters until years later.</p>
        <p>The other challenge facing both sides is that there are no easy remedies for protecting privacy. Even if consumers clamor about their rights, no politician wants to be seen taking steps that could hobble the new economy -- or provoke the Internet industry, which has become increasingly generous in doling out contributions.</p>
        <p>Candidates should also be mindful that there can be unintended consequences when they try to capitalize on a new issue.</p>
        <p>Strategists for Representative Debbie Stabenow, a Michigan Democrat, said that in their drive to topple the incumbent Republican, Senator Spencer Abraham, they plan to castigate him as siding with big business -- and against consumers -- on privacy matters.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Abraham shot back that he intends to play up that his campaign has an ''Internet privacy policy on our Web site -- and she doesn't even have one.''</p>
        <p>''It would be interesting for Congresswoman Stabenow to make that an issue,'' he said. ''We're explicit. We will protect the privacy of people who log on to our Web site.''</p>
