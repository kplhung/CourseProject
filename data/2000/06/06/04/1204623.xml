        <p>Lord Stanley was alive and well and living  in New Jersey  or at least on the top of Anthony DiFabrizio's red Volkswagen.</p>
        <p>Mr. DiFabrizio had carefully fashioned a foil-covered version of the Stanley Cup, the icon of world superiority in hockey, and he was making a Jersey statement.</p>
        <p>''I work at La Guardia Airport and I brought it in with my Devils shirt,'' he said. ''Carried it around. No one understood. I was a Devils fan in Ranger country.''</p>
        <p>Mr. DiFabrizio, who lives in Cranford, and his friend, John Spitz, of Nutley, had arrived nearly three hours early at the outer parking lot of the Continental Arena here  last Tuesday for the first game of the Stanley Cup finals between the New Jersey Devils and the Dallas Stars. But for Mr. DiFabrizio, the pre-tailgating had begun many hours earlier.</p>
        <p>''It's like I'm a little kid again,'' said Mr. DiFabrizio, who was taking small bites of his sandwich and talking as calmly as a meditation instructor. ''I was here in 1995, when the Devils won the Stanley Cup. Next to the birth of my son, it was the most exciting time of my life.''</p>
        <p>But as excited folks go, Mr. DiFabrizio and Mr. Spitz were quite sedate. Where in Detroit they throw octopus on the ice and in Philadelphia they throw nearly everything everywhere, in New Jersey, the rabble is rarely roused.</p>
        <p>''We never have any problems here,'' said Doug Magerka of Union, a member of the Meadowlands Sports Complex traffic patrol. ''To tell you the truth, with tickets that cost maybe $100, they are upper-middle-class folks with manners.</p>
        <p>''Now, when the Philly fans were here, they were a little crazy, with all their war paint and yelling and screaming,'' Mr. Magerka said. ''But the Devils fans, they are nice and calm.''</p>
        <p>With three National Hockey League teams -- the Devils, the Rangers and the Islanders -- the New York metropolitan area is arguably the most hockey-ed up locus in the world.</p>
        <p>The Philadelphia Flyers draw a good portion of their fans from South Jersey, and those in Manhattan and points north and east are clearly in Rangers and Islanders country. But for those who love them and live in their midst, the Devils are heart-warmers.</p>
        <p>Kelly Livett, 25, of Carteret, had the slightest bit of Devils war paint on as she sipped a beer with her younger brother, Gary, 21, of Lawrence Harbor. The charcoals on their tailgating grill weren't flaming right, but, like true Devils fans, they were calm and cool about it.</p>
        <p>''The reason you root for the Devils is because you come from New Jersey and you are loyal,'' Ms. Livett said.</p>
        <p>''They are an incredibly loyal team; proof is that Brodeur could have signed elsewhere for more money but stayed here,'' she said, referring to the team's goalie, Martin Brodeur.</p>
        <p>Hockey often brings out the most rabid of fans, but there seems to be little blood lust in Devils partisans. There is little pushing and shoving in Continental Arena. People not paid to do so can be seen actually picking up stray hot dog wrappers. The biggest cheers seem to come after the Devils make a good rush on the goal.</p>
        <p>''We're not nuts, just good fans,' said Mr. Spitz. ''We know the game.''</p>
        <p>They even love their parents.</p>
        <p>''Our son knew we would enjoy this, that we were loyal New Jersey people, so he got us playoff tickets,'' said Basil Tahan of Clifton.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tahan was wearing a No. 99 Devils jersey. His wife, Jean, had on No. 9. ''These were my son, Brian's, numbers at Clifton and Quinnipiac College. Now they are our Devils numbers.</p>
        <p>''Why are we Devils fans?,'' he asked. ''Because we have taste. And because we are from New Jersey. That is the way we have to be.''</p>
        <p>The band outside the arena may have been playing songs by Billy Joel, a Long Islander, but that didn't faze Linda Romano, a true Devils fan. Ms. Romano used to live in Clifton, but recently moved to Stewartstown, Pa., near the Maryland border. Still,  she had tickets to the playoffs, so she was driving 220 miles one way for each game.</p>
        <p>''I waved as I went by Philadelphia,'' she said. ''We beat them. I may live in Pennsylvania, but I am a New Jerseyan. So I am a Devils fan. Have to be.''</p>
        <p>Talk about loyalty. Trish Dolan of New Medford had what could be considered the worst seat in the house: Section 220, Row 22, seat 2, the very far upper corner of the Continental Arena.</p>
        <p>''Hey, it isn't bad,'' said Ms. Dolan, who was wearing a white Devils jersey with the No. 30 of her favorite player, Mr. Brodeur. ''I'm here. I sort of like having my own section. Besides, what are your other choices? Going to root for the Rangers or Islanders and get beer spilled on you all the time?''</p>
