        <p>Thus far into the presidential campaign, the debate over national missile defenses has been nothing short of surreal.</p>
        <p>On the one hand, President Clinton and Vice President Gore have been promoting a limited defense system to protect the nation against attacks by rogue nations, though the system has not been proven and may never work reliably. They have also been asking Russia to agree to amending the Antiballistic Missile Treaty to permit such a system, though the Russians have always adamantly opposed such an amendment and by all accounts will continue to do so at the summit meeting today in Moscow.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Gov. George W. Bush, backed by such cold war heavyweights as Henry Kissinger, George Shultz and Brent Scowcroft, has promised a much more robust national missile defense, though based on technologies he has not yet named. In addition, he has promised deep reductions in the American and Russian strategic arsenals. The Russians, however, have already told us that they see a larger defense effort as a threat to their nuclear deterrent. The idea that they would make deep reductions in the face of such effort defies logic.</p>
        <p>Everyone in Washington knows all of this, so what is going on? The answer, of course, is politics. But it is a politics that cannot be understood apart from the history of the debate: a debate that has never been about reality.</p>
        <p>On March 23, 1983, President Ronald Reagan, whose hard-line anti-Soviet policies had by then given rise to the largest antinuclear movement in cold war history, personally -- and almost in secret -- wrote an insert to a routine defense speech, calling on the scientific community to turn its great talents to the cause of world peace and to give us a means of rendering nuclear weapons ''impotent and obsolete.'' In background briefings after the speech there was talk of such Buck Rogers weaponry as space-based lasers that could destroy the entire Soviet missile fleet. Reagan's own officials, among them Mr. Shultz, his secretary of state, were appalled, and some speculated that the president had got the idea from a science fiction film. It took them almost a year to discover what a stroke of political genius the speech insert was.</p>
        <p>Since 1946, opinion polls had shown that the vast majority of Americans believed that scientists could develop a defense against nuclear missiles if they put their minds to it. Indeed, except when the issue of vulnerability was front and center in the news, most Americans expressed confidence that the United States had a defense against nuclear weapons already.</p>
        <p>Just two weeks after Reagan's speech, a White House poll asked respondents whether they believed scientists could come up with ''a really effective way to destroy Soviet nuclear missiles from space.'' The answer was, as always, a resounding yes. Reagan certainly expected this answer. In addition, he and his close aides recognized that because of its inherent ambiguity, a defense initiative would appeal to conservatives as a way to develop a weapons system even while it appealed to the public at large as a means to eliminating the nuclear threat.</p>
        <p>By the time of Reagan's re-election in November 1984, all of his top officials had lined up behind the Star Wars concept. A number of existing research programs were cobbled together, and the Strategic Defense Initiative was launched with great fanfare and much rhetoric about the potential of lasers and other exotic technologies. Mr. Shultz, Robert McFarlane and other moderates in the administration wanted to use S.D.I. as a bargaining chip for Soviet strategic weapons. ''It would be like giving them the sleeves off our vest,'' Mr. Shultz told the president.</p>
        <p>However, Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, his aide Richard Perle and their fellow hard-liners had other ideas. They saw S.D.I. as a way to block offensive arms reductions, to tear up the 1972 ABM treaty and to begin an arms race in defensive as well as offensive weapons.</p>
        <p>The two sides brawled for the rest of the Reagan administration, and neither succeeded in gaining its ends. In the meantime, however, S.D.I. became extremely popular in the polls. While the hard-liners pleased knowledgeable conservatives by blocking strategic talks, Reagan pleased the public by offering to share S.D.I. technology with the Soviets and promising the elimination of nuclear weapons. The antinuclear movement, its rhetoric stolen, gradually faded away.</p>
        <p>In the past 15 years, the United States has spent $60 billion on antimissile defense research and has yet to produce a workable weapons system. An effective defense of the country remains wholly elusive. Yet Republican conservatives have continued to speak as if exotic technologies were ready to jump off the assembly lines and have continued to press for a deployment of something -- anything -- that would irrevocably commit this country to an open-ended process of developing national missile defenses. The congressional Democrats tried to resist the pressure, but their ability to do so waxed and waned with their own political fortunes and those of the Republican right. In early 1998, or around the time the Republicans took  their impeachment case against President Clinton to the Senate, the Democrats gave way.</p>
        <p>The previous fall a congressional commission headed by Donald Rumsfeld, a former defense secretary, had concluded that ''rogue states'' could acquire ballistic missile technologies, and North Korea had test-fired a long-range missile out over the Pacific. In January the Clinton administration pledged funding for the deployment of a national missile defense system to cope with this threat. In March the Senate, with administration support, overwhelmingly approved a resolution calling for a deployment. At the time White House officials commented that the administration's support for the bill would help to defuse a potent political issue for the Republicans in the campaign of 2000.</p>
        <p>Last fall, Mr. Clinton announced he would make a final deployment decision this summer -- in the very midst of the presidential campaign. This determination clearly had little to do with technology, for the schedule did not permit time for adequate testing -- and since then one of the two tests has failed. Rather, it had to do with the fear that the Republicans would call Democrats weak on defense. In their unsuccessful attempt to persuade the Russians to agree to the deployment, administration officials assured them that they could defeat the system if they kept 1,000 or more strategic nuclear weapons on full alert. This was hardly a bargain for either country, given the decay of the Russian early-warning system and the increasing real threat of an accidental launch.</p>
        <p>In the midst of these technological and diplomatic embarrassments for the administration, Governor Bush revived the political issue by calling for the entire Reagan program: Star Wars, radical nuclear-arms reductions, the de-alerting of nuclear forces and the sharing of antimissile technology with our allies and possibly the Russians as well.</p>
        <p>The proposal is, of course, self-contradictory; it is also wildly implausible in that the Pentagon is no more likely to agree to give away advanced American technology than it ever was, and no country except the United States can afford an open-ended missile defense program. But then, the majority of Americans did not notice  any of these problems when Reagan made the proposal 15 years ago.</p>
