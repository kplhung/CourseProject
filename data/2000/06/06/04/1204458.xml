        <p>THE FUNDAMENTALS OF PLAY</p>
        <p>By Caitlin Macy.</p>
        <p>289 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Random House. $24.95.</p>
        <p>KATE GOODENOW is the kind of girl who works at Sotheby's, summers in Maine and truly believes that her years at boarding school were the best of her life. She finds New York ''dirty and awful,'' but ''so, so, so, so fun.'' She's such a type she scarcely seems real. Nevertheless, she's the axis on which Caitlin Macy's first novel spins -- the blond, blank foil for the passions and aspirations of her many male admirers. Kate is sporty and she's a sport too, which means she's always up for white-bread shenanigans like prank calls to someone's boss or swimming in public fountains. She's also something of a bore. Still, according to George Lenhart, the book's narrator and Kate's chief apologist, ''Kate was what you wanted, somehow, in this infinitely ironic age. She was the kind of girl about whom other girls used to say, 'All right, so she's thin but,' trying vainly to suss out the appeal.''</p>
        <p>George and Kate and their boarding-school pals find themselves in Manhattan after college (Dartmouth for George, Yale for Kate), but it's a weird, anomalous young fogy's Manhattan, a coded world of private clubs and shared antecedents and endless cocktails. The odd man out is Harry -- originally Henry -- Lombardi, a computer and math wizard who dropped out of Dartmouth to become a mini-software mogul. When we meet him, he's looking for seed money for his new company, which has something to do with providing access to -- you won't believe this -- the World Wide Web.</p>
        <p>Harry is awkward and eager and totally N.O.C.D. (not our class, dear), but he aches, improbably, to be part of this retrograde crowd. He has absorbed the Kate myth from his college friends: George and a pompous throwback called Chat Wethers. Harry can recite the details of Kate's privileged life, from her yacht club victories to her boarding-school romance with a stoned sailor townie, like a well-learned catechism. (Harry, it must be pointed out, is also -- yikes! -- a Catholic.) Harry sets out on a quest for Kate, and the collision between his world and hers spells ''train wreck'' in capital letters. George watches from the sidelines, keeping a cool, ironic distance until a final act forces him to choose between the ''Fairisles in camphor'' and real life.</p>
        <p>If this all seems familiar, it's because you've read it before -- or at least bits of it. I had so thoroughly confused George Lenhart with Nick Carraway that it was something of a shock when another Nick, the stoned sailor who is the book's real tragic figure, drifted across the page. I found myself riffling back to remind myself of George's name. Kate, inane and featherbrained and totally undeserving, is mostly Daisy Buchanan, yet without Daisy's innate sense of doom. Daisy knows she's dancing on the edge of the volcano; Kate is oblivious, although Macy throws in a few chiaroscuro touches, hints of a ''rest'' cure or two. ''It's just a little trouble she had last winter,'' Chat confides to George. ''She wasn't getting out enough, she wasn't having fun.'' But Kate is mostly just a bowl of milk: ''From the blank, pleasant expression on her face, you would have thought she could see no farther than the inner surface of her own eye.''</p>
        <p>Sometimes Harry is Gatsby and sometimes he's Rex Mottram, the ''new man'' in Waugh's ''Brideshead Revisited,'' another portrait of a society's last days. Sometimes Kate is Julia Marchmain, trying to pole-vault herself beyond the irrelevancies of her class in an alliance with the new man. And then George is Charles Ryder, Waugh's emotionally hamstrung narrator. Says George-as-Charles: ''It was my problem if I lived life ironically, if indeed it was the only way I knew. It wasn't as if I even believed in it. I saw how thin it was, I saw the poverty of it -- that I couldn't make love to her because it wasn't an ironic act.''</p>
        <p>''The Fundamentals of Play'' invites these sorts of lit-crit imaginings because it has such a period-piece feel. It's like a Whit Stillman movie; you keep thinking, ''Who are these people?'' Macy is a nice writer, and there are some wonderfully evocative passages -- about the group's anachronisms, say, or Newport, Kate's family seat, or sailing, or this one about Kate's aunt: ''Her face was tan -- the whole party was filled with parents who had better tans than their children -- and she wore pink lipstick that sat on her lips and beamed when they beamed.'' But you wish Macy would shake the shtick. It doesn't help that she's chosen a male narrator; the gender switch ruins the pitch and compounds the book's costume-drama portentousness. In any case, the mental terrain of a narrator like George has been amply Baedekered. But the Kates of this world represent truly foreign territory. What a book Macy might have made of Kate's inner life.</p>
        <p>Much of the time, Macy's characters say and do the most improbable things. It's hard to stifle the giggles when Harry starts talking about his business: ''The computer network -- the interconnected networks. The 'World Wide Web.' And I'm going to be providing a, a, like an entrance to it. Or like, like a navigation tool. A, ah, whatchama call it -- on a boat. You know.'' Poor Harry is always sputtering. If you've read ''The New New Thing,'' it's hard not to see the dissonance between Harry and Jim Clark, with his damn-them-all flourishes. Sure, it's not fair to make comparisons between journalism and fiction, but by inserting such a specific real-time reference, Macy forces this one.</p>
        <p>I READ that Scott Rudin has bought the rights to this novel for Paramount Pictures -- for a sum in ''the mid-six figures,'' according to The Hollywood Reporter -- because the story has so many casting opportunities for young actors. Come to think of it, ''The Fundamentals of Play'' probably would make a good movie -- at least a better movie than a novel like this, with its cardboard-cutout characters, upon whom the plot rests uneasily, just as Kate wears her clothes. While I was reading it, I amused myself by casting the different parts.</p>
        <p>The default choice for Kate, of course, is Gwyneth Paltrow, for her long-limbed, blond blandness, her Spenceness. But really, even Paltrow is too kittenish for the wooden Kate. The newly blond but still-dark-at-heart Ed Norton can be George, with his genteel poverty and his doubts. Harry's a tough one. Ben Stiller? Too goofy. Johnny Depp? Too delicate. Keanu Reeves? Just kidding. But I'm still stumped. Unlike Gatsby, Harry isn't done in by his humanity -- which I guess makes this a new story after all.</p>
