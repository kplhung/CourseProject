        <p>As families buried the dead, two men were arrested and charged with the killings of five people who were herded into the basement of a Wendy's restaurant in Queens, N.Y. Two others were wounded. A prosecutor described how the victims were bound, gagged and blindfolded with duct tape, their heads covered with plastic bags, and shot one by one as they knelt in a freezer room. The suspects, John B. Taylor, 36, and Craig Godineaux, 30, could face the death penalty.</p>
