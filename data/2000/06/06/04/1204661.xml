      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Authorities last month collected 49 handguns and 37 rifles in the first phase of Westchester's gun buyback program. The county paid $3,400 for the guns during the no-questions-asked, three-day gun amnesty held in Ossining. A second phase, held in in Croton last week, netted 29 more weapons in six hours, at a cost of $1,225. A combined effort of the district attorney's office and the county executive, the program offers $50 for each handgun and $25 for each rifle or shotgun. The county will not trace the origin of the guns or attempt to see whether they were involved in crimes. The plan is to melt the guns down and possibly use the metal to build a memorial to victims of gun violence.</p>
