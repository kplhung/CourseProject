        <p>THE feathers and costumes hadn't arrived yet, and the music came from a tinny boom box, not a live orchestra. The dancer was all concentration nevertheless, flying across the rehearsal space, muscles taut, legs kicking rhythmically, feet striking the ground just so.</p>
        <p>''Beautiful!'' exclaimed the choreographer, Creeky Routson, from her perch on the dancer's back. Then she reached down and rewarded him with an alfalfa pellet.</p>
        <p>Ms. Routson and her horse were preparing for ''Le Carrousel du Roi,'' a Baroque equestrian ballet that is the centerpiece of a weeklong early-music festival based in Berkeley, Calif. And while the 20 horses starring in this ambitious production are considerably taller, broader and hairier than the average ballerina, they are as disciplined and carefully trained as any human corps de ballet.</p>
        <p>Their dance, which will be performed on Friday and Saturday, recreates an equine extravaganza presented in Paris in 1612 in the Place Royale (now the Place des Voges) to celebrate the betrothal of Louis XIII. It uses the vocabulary of dressage, a demanding method of horse training that in 17th-century France was the cutting edge of military technology.</p>
        <p>''These moves require enormous strength from the horse and enormous cooperation,'' said Ms. Routson, a medalist in national dressage competitions. ''I think people are going to be thrilled. The horse people are excited about it and the music people are, too.''</p>
        <p>In addition to the horse ballet, the Berkeley Festival and Exhibition will present more than 25 other musical events starting today through next Sunday, including concerts of Bach motets and vocal music from the library of Cardinal Richelieu, a fully staged version of Handel's cantata ''Aminta e Fillide'' and selections from the ''lost'' operas of Johann Kapsberger.</p>
        <p>More than 50 additional ''fringe'' concerts will supplement the main events. The festival also offers symposiums on Bach performance and Renaissance spectacle, master classes in lute and harpsichord, displays and sales of instruments and recordings and meetings of enthusiast groups like the American Guild of Organists and the Viola da Gamba Society.</p>
        <p>''People from the early-music community come from all over to see each other and perform together,'' said Robert Cole, the director of Cal Performances, which produces the festival and other performing arts events at the University of California, Berkeley. ''This is not only a festival but a big party.''</p>
        <p>Berkeley's thriving early-music scene, nurtured by the university town's rich tradition of eccentricity and erudition, inspired Cal Performances to organize the first Berkeley Festival in 1990. It takes place in even-numbered years, alternating with a similar festival in Boston.</p>
        <p>In each of their biennial programs, Berkeley Festival organizers try to include one blockbuster capable of attracting both early-music fans and broader audiences. At the 1998 festival it was the United States premiere of ''Platee,'' a little-known 1745 opera about a lovelorn frog composed by Jean-Philippe Rameau and vividly reimagined by the choreographer Mark Morris. Both audiences and critics loved the production, which went on to a successful run at the New York City Opera this spring.</p>
        <p>This year's blockbuster is the equestrian ballet, which will be performed at a dressage arena here. It is highly unlikely that this production will travel to another venue, however. ''The impetus was that we had something here that nobody else in the world could do, that nobody else is ever going to do,'' said Mr. Cole. And weeks before show time the response was already tremendous. ''It's off the map in terms of ticket sales,'' he reported happily. ''We're reaching a whole new audience.''</p>
        <p>THE reconstruction of the horse ballet was made possible by Kate van Orden, a musicologist at Berkeley who unearthed the choreography and music of the 1612 event. That elaborate spectacle included not only dancing horses but lions, elephants, flaming volcanoes and an audience of 200,000 people.</p>
        <p>The current edition of the ballet, though modest compared to the original, still promises plenty of excitement. To the sounds of trumpets, drums and an orchestra of shawms, sackbuts and bagpipes, led by Richard Cheetham, tumblers will vault over their horses and knights will stage a mock combat. There will be singing and poetry and a dance by six ''demoiselles'' riding Haflinger ponies, a fantastical-looking breed with thick white manes and tails.</p>
        <p>The horse ballet, the program's final act, will feature knights, squires and horses in richly decorated period costumes, dancing to the original 1612 score by Robert Ballard and following the original choreography. The horses will pirouette, skip and canter sideways in response to the music and subtle shifts of posture by their human partners, whom Ms. Routson calls ''some of the best competition riders in Northern California.''</p>
        <p>Those expecting horses to jump about on their hind legs ''Fantasia'' style, will be disappointed. This equestrian ballet, like human ballet of the same period, emphasizes obedience to pattern and hierarchy rather than over-the-top emotionalism. ''This is a very French aesthetic,'' Ms. van Orden explained, ''all about effortlessness and economy of gesture.''</p>
        <p>These are horses, however, so even small gestures are not all that small.</p>
        <p>And while some of the movements may be subtle, the trumpets, drums and colorful costumes will be anything but. ''This is going to have all of that knightly pomp and circumstance,'' Ms. van Orden said. ''The kind of thing that people loved back then and that they still seem to love now.''</p>
