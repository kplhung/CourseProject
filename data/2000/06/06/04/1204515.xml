        <p>Q May a condominium board use a simple majority vote to impose restraints on the sale or leasing of individual units? Wouldn't the board first be required to change the condominium bylaws, something that typically takes a two-thirds majority vote? . . . Raymond K. Hormon, the Bronx.</p>
        <p>A Dennis H. Greenstein, a Manhattan co-op and condo lawyer, said that while the letter writer does not specify what the proposed restraints on selling or leasing are, there are limits on what a condo board may do regarding such matters. Unlike co-op boards, which have significant control and discretion over the selling and subletting of apartments, a condo board's ability to restrict sales and leasing is based on the powers given to the board in the declaration and bylaws.</p>

        <p>Q May a condominium board use a simple majority vote to impose restraints on the sale or leasing of individual units? Wouldn't the board first be required to change the condominium bylaws, something that typically takes a two-thirds majority vote? . . . Raymond K. Hormon, the Bronx.</p>
        <p>A Dennis H. Greenstein, a Manhattan co-op and condo lawyer, said that while the letter writer does not specify what the proposed restraints on selling or leasing are, there are limits on what a condo board may do regarding such matters. Unlike co-op boards, which have significant control and discretion over the selling and subletting of apartments, a condo board's ability to restrict sales and leasing is based on the powers given to the board in the declaration and bylaws.</p>
        <p>A board generally could not entirely prohibit the leasing of units, Mr. Greenstein said, unless the bylaws contain a provision giving it the power to do so. On the other hand, he said, condo boards usually have the power to impose certain conditions or restrictions on sales and leasing.</p>
        <p>For example, he said, a condo's bylaws might give the board the right to seek information from or impose fees on prospective purchasers or tenants. They might also permit a board to require a diplomat to partly waive diplomatic immunity as a condition of leasing an apartment.</p>
        <p>Finally, Mr. Greenstein said, the letter writer is correct: any amendment to the condo bylaws and declaration requires the approval of at least two-thirds of the unit owners.</p>
        <p>The Confidentiality Of Census Returns</p>
        <p>Q Every week I read articles in the Streetscapes column regarding the history of interesting older buildings. Often the articles cite census returns as the source of information about past residents. At the same time, however, we hear President Clinton assuring us that census returns are completely confidential. Are they confidential? Are there time limits on their confidentiality or exceptions for newsworthiness? . . . Stephanie Geliebter, Manhattan.</p>
        <p>A Neil Tillman, a media relations spokesman for the Bureau of the Census in Washington, said that by law the personal information contained in census returns must be kept confidential for 72 years.</p>
        <p>''We release no confidential information before that time,'' Mr. Tillman said, adding that in addition to prohibiting the release of such information to the press or public, the law forbids the Census Bureau from sharing answers on census returns with any government agency, including the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Immigration and Naturalization Service and even the Office of the President.</p>
        <p>''Technically speaking, there is no way that a reporter could have gotten census information that isn't at least 72 years old,'' Mr. Tillman said.</p>
        <p>Christopher Gray, who writes the Streetscapes column, said that he does indeed use census returns to obtain information about past residents and owners of New York buildings. However, he said, the census records he uses are the 1890 New York City Police Department census and the New York State census filings from 1905, 1915 and 1925. Mr. Gray said that he also gets information from past federal census returns. The most recent returns he has access to, however, are from the 1920 census.</p>
