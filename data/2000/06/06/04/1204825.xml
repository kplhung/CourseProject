        <p>In the annals of political hucksterism, it will undoubtedly go down as one of the strangest pitches ever made.</p>
        <p>Selling Gov. George W. Bush of Texas to the voters at a rally in Albuquerque this week, Gov. Gary E. Johnson of New Mexico recounted a conversation that he and Mr. Bush once had about the speakers at a conference of state leaders.</p>
        <p>''George turns to me,'' Mr. Johnson recalled, ''and says, 'What are they talking about?' I said, 'I don't know.' He said, 'You don't know a thing, do you?' And I said, 'Not one thing.' He said, 'Neither do I.' And we kind of high-fived.''</p>
        <p>It was a populist tribute to Mr. Bush as the antithesis of an egghead, or at least it was supposed to be. But the way it came across raised a serious strategic question: are Mr. Bush and his allies overplaying his disdain for intellectualism, to the point where they are sometimes making him out to be a self-satisfied boob?</p>
        <p>In February, Representative J. C. Watts Jr., Republican of Oklahoma, talked Mr. Bush up to voters in South Carolina by reassuring them that a president does not have to be clever.</p>
        <p>''You can buy clever,'' Mr. Watts said.</p>
        <p>In the nearly four months since then, Mr. Bush has frequently curled his lip at the mention of Ivy League types who tote mental suitcases jammed with facts and figures, readily conceded his limited appetite for long policy briefings or memos, and deflected questions about gaps in his experience with a sunny pledge to assemble and rely on the keenest, most scrupulous advisers he can find.</p>
        <p>He did it again on Friday, when he addressed the participants at a celebration of the 20th anniversary of CNN. In response to a question from a Saudi Arabian journalist about international affairs, Mr. Bush did not claim to be well read on the subject or well along the road to erudition (although, in fact, he has slogged through thick tomes on Russia and the Balkans in recent months). Instead, Mr. Bush suggested that raw knowledge was overrated.</p>
        <p>''I don't think you can expect any president to know all things about all subjects,'' he said, adding that one of the roles of a leader was ''to surround himself with excellent folks'' and ''to be able to listen and to be able to delegate.''</p>
        <p>That perspective may not be revolutionary or reckless. But Mr. Bush's sustained promotion of it -- along with his tendency to throw stones at ivory towers and challenge any suggestion that book learning could trump horse sense -- is unusually aggressive, a kind of thumbing of his nose at comedians' jokes about him and political analysts' assessments of one of his greatest weaknesses as a candidate.</p>
        <p>And some political analysts see it as risky. They say that this approach may bet too heavily on the belief that Americans hanker for a folksy, ordinary guy in the White House, and that it may pay too little heed to their desire for someone who exudes confidence about solving complex problems without summoning a supplementary brain trust.</p>
        <p>''Americans don't want a know-it-all,'' said Stephen J. Wayne, a political scientist at Georgetown University whose specialty is the American presidency.</p>
        <p>''But they do want a president with some intellectual ability,'' Mr. Wayne said. ''What Bush has to watch is that he doesn't reinforce stereotypes that there is not much there.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's aides are attuned to that. Aboard his campaign plane on Friday afternoon, one of them appeared vaguely panic-stricken and did a quick survey, presumably looking for cameras, when the Texas governor appeared among a few members of the press corps cradling a book titled ''Spanish for Dummies.'' It was not Mr. Bush's, and he was merely using it to tease a reporter. But the alarmed aide seemed to understand that a photograph of the moment would not convey such distinctions and would yield to less flattering interpretations.</p>
        <p>It would also, ultimately, bother Mr. Bush, whose frequently sharp wit suggests that he is plenty bright and who really wants to have it all ways.</p>
        <p>He wants to distinguish and separate himself from Ivy League intellectuals and any arrogance associated with their educational milieu. But he repeatedly invokes Yale, from which he got his bachelor's degree, and Harvard, from which he got a master's in business administration, as proof that people who question his smarts are foolish to do so.</p>
        <p>He exhibits a disinclination to store or brandish certain details and information, but exudes a defensiveness about intimations that he does not know all that much.</p>
        <p>Several weeks ago, he presented a television network producer who is a Harvard alumnus with an advertisement for audio tapes, torn from a magazine, that promised ''a Harvard graduate's vocabulary in just 15 minutes a day!''</p>
        <p>''I have just ordered several,'' Mr. Bush scribbled across the page. ''What do you think? Do I have a chance?''</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, he fumed at the memory of one of the many times during the presidential campaign when he felt his level of intellectual engagement was being underestimated.</p>
        <p>Bantering with Chris Matthews, the host of the television news program ''Hardball,'' during a commercial break in a taping of the show, Mr. Bush remembered that he had once publicly told Mr. Matthews that his favorite author was Winston Churchill. And Mr. Bush said that a pundit subsequently deemed the comment to be a scripted effort to please Mr. Matthews, a known Churchill devotee.</p>
        <p>''Do you think I'd take time out of my life to research what the hell you like?'' Mr. Bush asked Mr. Matthews. He said that he had read ''a lot more books than you give me credit for.''</p>
        <p>That is undoubtedly so, but it is sometimes Mr. Bush and his allies who are denying the Texas governor the credit.</p>
        <p>After all, it was not Mr. Bush's thoughtfulness or eagerness to be informed that Mr. Johnson saw fit to praise during his remarks on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>To the contrary, Mr. Johnson saluted Mr. Bush as the rare ''somebody who will rather admit -- or rather talk about -- the things they don't know and make that really evident.''</p>
