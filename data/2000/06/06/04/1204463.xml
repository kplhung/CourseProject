        <p>FIONA RANGE</p>
        <p>By Mary McGarry Morris.</p>
        <p>418 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Viking. $24.95.</p>
        <p>In the first paragraph of ''Fiona Range,'' the eponymous heroine discovers herself in bed with a man she can't remember bringing home. Some of the adjectives used to describe her impressions upon awakening are: ''foul,'' ''ragged,'' ''naked,'' ''musky,'' ''sweating,'' ''hairy,'' ''sluggish,'' ''rigid,'' ''blurred.'' The reader knows immediately that this will be a novel in which uncomfortable things happen and that mating will be among its concerns. A few pages on, encountering girlish sentences like ''What had she been thinking, sleeping with Brad Glidden? But as usual, she hadn't been thinking. . . . And now this mess,'' the reader might want to categorize the book as women's romance fiction -- but this would be premature.</p>
        <p>''Fiona Range,'' Mary McGarry Morris's fourth novel, is her lightest and in many ways not her best. Sometimes its plot contrivances make it hard to take seriously. Yet it's notable for its emotional intensity, and for the conviction with which much of it is narrated. As with Morris's earlier novels -- Vanished'' (1988) was nominated for a National Book Award, ''A Dangerous Woman'' (1991) was made into a movie and ''Songs in Ordinary Time'' (1995) was an Oprah pick -- this book's aims are as serious as they can be: to examine the moral consequences of the things people do for love.</p>
        <p>Fiona is a love child. Her mother gave birth to her out of wedlock and shortly afterward disappeared. Fiona was brought up alongside three cousins by her aunt and uncle, Arlene and Charles Hollis, leading citizens in their small New England town. Her aunt and uncle indulge her, yet they also keep her at a distance. She's not really one of theirs, their attitude says, and the secrets of her birth are too awful to be told. Though Fiona is beautiful, bright, high-spirited and generous, she feels unwanted.</p>
        <p>As a result, she's always been a daredevil. She doesn't care much for propriety, preferring to flout conventional wisdom. If she's careless with herself, why shouldn't she be? ''I was born with a reputation,'' she says to Chester, the owner of the coffee shop where she works as a waitress. ''No, not a reputation!'' Chester replies. ''With that big, fat chip on your shoulder!''</p>
        <p>When the novel opens, Fiona is running out of patience with her circumstances. Haltingly, she embarks upon a quest: to discover her real family, to find a place where she belongs, to redeem herself. Her progress is often painful. She makes choices that get her deeper and deeper into trouble; again and again she takes what appears to be a chance remark and twists it against herself; she suffers repeated rejections; she keeps on pushing. It's winter and she needs warmth. ''No matter how brilliant the sun, a cold metallic sharpness now thinned each day's briefer light. . . . She dreaded the short days and longer nights, the freezing months to come in front of the television. All she wanted was someone who cared how she felt and what she thought about the simplest things, someone who would know when she left the room and keep glancing at the door until she returned. Was that too much to ask?''</p>
        <p>There are two young men in the picture: one is the fiance of Fiona's cousin Elizabeth, her close friend and temperamental opposite; the other is Elizabeth's former boyfriend. One of these men, the reader strongly suspects, may end up as Fiona's husband.</p>
        <p>But before she can feel worthy of a respectable man she needs to settle the question of her parentage. Desperate for a connection, she tries to befriend Patrick Grady, the menacing town eccentric she believes to be her father. Patrick's face is disfigured by scars; he lives in squalor in a shack on the edge of a deep and dangerous quarry. Everyone tells her he's crazy and violent. But Fiona thinks all he needs is a daughter's softening love. He claims she's not his daughter, but she doesn't believe it. Then he starts responding to her advances and making advances of his own. What will happen when he gets really mad at her?</p>
        <p>Morris is a deliberately old-fashioned novelist. She's not interested in contemporary culture, and her characters don't make ironic references to it; instead they talk about what matters most to them -- family, their own and one another's. Morris regards their emotional distress and moral failings with sincerity and compassion.</p>
        <p>Her attention, when it's on, is unflinching. She can bring the ordinary to life with the sheer clarity of her vision. She knows how a house with children in it sounds at night, what the heat and bustle in a kitchen feel like before a family dinner and how indiscretions arise in the dining room when everyone is flushed with food and wine. When Fiona works in the coffee shop the reader can feel her moving between the hungry customers and the steamy kitchen, taking orders and balancing plates. There's a gem of a scene in a bridal shop, where Elizabeth is so unenthusiastic about selecting a wedding gown that Fiona ends up trying on the dresses; everything about the cousins' complex affection for each other is effortlessly illuminated.</p>
        <p>But there are also passages in which Morris doesn't seem engaged. There are love scenes, for example -- He kissed her brow, her eyes and nose, the space above her mouth, and now his lips moved against hers'' -- that feel almost generic. And many of the plot revelations are so well worn as to be totally predictable.</p>
        <p>And then something unexpected happens. It turns out that Fiona's quest, with its echoes of fairy tale and myth, was all along exerting a much deeper pull than the reader, diverted by shopping trips and arguments with fussy neighbors, could have imagined. That, at least, is one way to explain the power of the ending, when after 400-odd pages a novel that has settled for being not as good as it could be becomes extraordinary.</p>
        <p>Earlier, Elizabeth has said: ''You have to think of other people, Fiona. It's like when you drop a stone in the pond. The hurt goes out in ripples, and it affects everyone.'' This is a fairly commonplace remark. Yet when the reader understands the full extent of its application in ''Fiona Range,'' the effect is devastating. Lies and secrets have tainted the upstanding Hollis family, and the ripples are felt throughout the town. The reader feels them, too. In its chilling last pages the novel serves as a reminder: no one is safe from the pain of missed opportunities and misunderstood intentions and, the saddest thing of all, love gone wrong.</p>
