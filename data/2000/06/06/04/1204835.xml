        <p>As Sierra Leone slid back into war last month, the British were conspicuous as the one Western power willing to shore up the faltering United Nations peacekeeping force. To many, their presence merely emphasized the absence of the United States, which last year was a major backer of the peace agreement that granted amnesty to a brutal warlord, Foday Sankoh, and even brought him into government.</p>
        <p>To critics, including senior officials in the State Department, that agreement amounted to the Clinton administration's Band-Aid response to criticism of its African policy after Mr. Clinton went to Africa in 1998, talked of an African Renaissance and promised greater involvement in the continent.</p>
        <p>To backers of the Lome agreement -- named for the capital of Togo, where it was signed last July -- the inclusion of Mr. Sankoh and amnesty for his gunmens' atrocities was the only effective way to stop a war outsiders would not help end militarily. A Clinton administration official said the choices were Lome or ''chaos,'' adding that the accord was intended to ''end the killing, restore order, point a way forward.''</p>
        <p>Sierra Leone's violence has pointed up the quandary facing Western governments in the post-cold-war world of geopolitically insignificant but spectacularly brutal conflicts. In the Balkans, and last year in East Timor, outside powers have intervened to halt bloodshed.</p>
        <p>In Africa, many critics say, the Clinton administration has been unwilling to risk the lives of American troops since the deaths of 18 soldiers in Somalia in 1993. The administration faces Congressional constraints in paying for international peacekeeping efforts and, the critics say, pays only intermittent attention.</p>
        <p>Whether justified or not, a result of this criticism is that Washington's offers of help to calm Sierra Leone's most recent violence have largely been spurned. Kofi Annan, secretary general of the United Nations, rejected an offer to fly fresh United Nations troops to Sierra Leone because the price of American military planes was too high.</p>
        <p>When the Rev. Jesse Jackson, President Clinton's special envoy for democracy in Africa, came to West Africa to help defuse the crisis, he was forced to cancel a stop in Sierra Leone because he was not welcome.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jackson was given the role of special envoy to Africa after helping to keep the black vote solidly behind Mr. Clinton in 1996. He is a vocal proponent of intervening in Africa's conflicts.</p>
        <p>In May last year, Mr. Jackson criticized the administration for protecting Kosovo Albanians but leaving Africans to defend themselves so  that Sierra Leone's war was ''fought in the dark'' for seven years.</p>
        <p>His remarks helped to train American attention on Sierra Leone, where Mr. Sankoh's rebels had killed, raped and hacked the limbs off thousands of inhabitants in an assault on Freetown in January 1999. Last summer, peace talks that had limped along in Lome suddenly yielded an agreement to share power, and hold elections in 2001.</p>
        <p>The embrace of Mr. Sankoh was distasteful to many.</p>
        <p>''It seemed to be yet another indication of the U.S. being unwilling to invest the political capital to ensure that a sustainable peace could be arrived at by incorporating the broader issues of human rights,'' said Janet Fleischman of Human Rights Watch. ''When you do that, you may have a short-term solution, but it will not buy you peace in the long run.''</p>
        <p>At the State Department, an administration official said, three high-ranking officials -- Harold H. Koh, the assistant secretary of state for human rights; David J. Scheffer, the ambassador at large for war crimes; Julia V. Taft, the assistant secretary of state for refugees -- recorded their opposition to giving Mr. Sankoh a role in the government.</p>
        <p>Supporters hoped that they could eventually wrest control of Sierra Leone's diamond mines from Mr. Sankoh, who became chairman of the commission that manages vital resources. His men have long controlled the mines, using diamonds to buy arms.</p>
        <p>In retrospect, even supporters see the flaws. ''Bring Sankoh into the government? Make him the head diamond counter? What were we thinking?'' said another American official.</p>
        <p>The pressure to reach the Lome accord began to build after Mr. Sankoh's assault on Freetown. Nigeria, which was leading a West African intervention force known as Ecomog, managed to recapture the town from the warlord's Revolutionary United Front. But Nigeria's involvement in Sierra Leone was costly -- in cash and human lives -- and increasingly unpopular back home. After taking office in May last year, Nigeria's president, Olusegun Obasanjo, pledged to pull out.</p>
        <p>Clinton administration officials and several Congressmen, searching for a way to fill the vacuum Nigeria would leave, began looking to Mr. Jackson and his long friendship with Charles Taylor, the warlord-turned-president of Liberia, Sierra Leone's eastern neighbor, who in turn was a friend and ally of Mr. Sankoh.</p>
        <p>The administration official said  American decision makers on Sierra Leone decided to overlook the conflict of interest between Mr. Jackson and Mr. Taylor for the sake of ''political expediency and the pressure from Nigerians to get out.'' Mr. Jackson leaned on Mr. Taylor to lean on Mr. Sankoh to go to Lome, the official said, and the accord was signed.</p>
        <p>As a corollary, a United Nations force with no American soldiers was envisaged to keep peace and to win the American financing that Congress had refused for the West African force.</p>
        <p>One problem with the accord was that the government Mr. Sankoh joined, and its president, Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, were -- and remain -- powerless and unpopular, dependent on outsiders for survival.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kabbah, a former United Nations Development Program official, rarely seems to leave his hilltop presidential palace; his presence is manifested mostly as a voice in his weekly radio address.</p>
        <p>Sierra Leonean and American officials with knowledge of the peace talks say negotiators believed that Mr. Sankoh was central to any lasting peace. A deal signed in 1996 unraveled precisely because it had no  role for him. What is more, after Mr. Sankoh was arrested on an arms trafficking charge in Nigeria and later sentenced to death for treason in Sierra Leone in late 1998, his men went on their ghastly spree of maiming and killing.</p>
        <p>Amnesty was granted, not only to Mr. Sankoh and his men, but also to other militias.</p>
        <p>''From the government point of view, the benefits outweighed the costs of having that provision in the accord,'' said Septimus Kaikai, President Kabbah's spokesman. ''If you look at the war from '91 to '99, the amount of people who have lost their lives, or were maimed, or raped, or had their properties destroyed -- granting amnesty was to bring peace and create the environment for the government to get things back on track.''</p>
        <p>To reduce the potential embarrassment of giving amnesty to Mr. Sankoh, the United Nations signed the Lome accord with a notation declaring that the amnesty did not apply internationally -- a ruse that allowed the accord's backers to argue that Mr. Sankoh could eventually be tried outside Sierra Leone.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration's participation was capped last October by a visit from Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright to Freetown. Dr. Albright toured a camp for mutilated victims, cuddled a 3-year-old girl without hands, and -- in a building carefully placed off limits to photographers and journalists by her aides -- met Mr. Sankoh, who was several hours late.</p>
        <p>''Sankoh is delivering the right message,'' she said, ''and I hope very much he will continue to intensify his efforts to insure full adherence to the Lome accord.''</p>
        <p>After Dr. Albright's visit, Washington's interest in Sierra Leone waned. The United Nations dispatched soldiers from India, Pakistan and other African nations to serve as peacekeepers. But when, in late April and early May, that force tried to go to the area of the diamond mines, and -- simultaneously -- the last of the Nigerian troops left Sierra Leone, Mr. Sankoh's men took 500 peacekeepers hostage.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration announced that Mr. Jackson would come to West Africa to help negotiate the hostages' release. But even before he left the United States, Mr. Jackson angered people in Freetown by saying that Mr. Sankoh ''should be coaxed back into the political equation'' and by drawing a parallel between Mr. Sankoh's Revolutionary United Front and Nelson Mandela's African National Congress.</p>
        <p>After intense pressure from the State Department, Mr. Jackson later adopted a harder stance against Mr. Sankoh. But it was too late. Mr. Jackson's friendship with Mr. Taylor is viewed askance in Freetown, and his safety could not be guaranteed here.</p>
        <p>Salih Booker, a senior fellow at the Africa Policy Information Center in Washington, said the reliance on Mr. Jackson is a symptom of a muddled policy and lack of commitment toward Africa in general.</p>
        <p>''He just flies out with his own God-given talents and allows the administration to wish him well and distance itself in some ways,'' Mr. Booker said. ''If he fails, it's his failure. If he succeeds, it's the Clinton administration's success.''</p>
        <p>Other critics, like Mr. Annan, said that new, complex peacekeeping efforts like those in Sierra Leone were severely limited by the United States' lack of willingness to provide direct military assistance.</p>
        <p>On May 26, President Clinton announced $20 million in aid to the United Nations and several individual nations, including Nigeria, for their operations in Sierra Leone.</p>
        <p>''Sierra Leone's people have suffered far too much, for far too long,'' Mr. Clinton said, ''and they need immediate assistance to prevent a return to full-scale civil war.''</p>
