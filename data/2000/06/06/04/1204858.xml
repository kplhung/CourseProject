        <p>The Indiana Pacers never trailed in the Eastern Conference finals.

        <p>The Indiana Pacers never trailed in the Eastern Conference finals. And yet, after losing two lackluster games to the Knicks in Madison Square Garden last week, they seemed like a train derailed, the players ready to scatter their separate ways to free agency, if not their summer tee times.</p>
        <p>Jalen Rose said the offense was staid and predictable. Travis Best hinted that speed would be a better starting option at point guard.</p>
        <p>And Reggie Miller was out of character altogether, having scored no more than 19 points a game in a series he supposedly could not wait to dominate, against a team he hated with a well-documented passion.</p>
        <p>Only when Miller turned into the best version of himself, demanding the ball and letting his shots silence the Garden crowd in Game 6 on Friday night, was the Pacers' transformation complete. They started rebounding. They started playing defense. They adopted the intensity that their third-year coach, Larry Bird, had as a Hall of Fame player. And they brought the franchise its first appearance in the National Basketball Association finals.</p>
        <p>Miller scored a game-high 34 points, 17 in the decisive fourth quarter, and finished with 5 rebounds and 4 steals in the Pacers' 93-80 victory.</p>
        <p>''Game 7 would have been, to tell you the truth, too much pressure for us,'' Miller said. ''We wanted to end it here. Tonight was our Game 7.''</p>
        <p>Miller sank three 3-pointers and all eight of his free throws in the fourth quarter, sending the Pacers to their first Eastern Conference championship after two devastating near-misses.</p>
        <p>''Time and time again, he made the big plays,'' the Pacers' Dale Davis said. ''Every time they made a run, he stuck a basket at the most crucial times.''</p>
        <p>As the Knicks were making a final run, Miller said he told Bird: ''Just run the offense every single play through me. Either I will get a good look or someone else will get a good look, but I had to have my hands on the basketball.''</p>
        <p>That kind of urgency, which was missing in Miller in last year's Game 6 loss to the Knicks at the Garden, emerged before the game.</p>
        <p>''I thought I would flip the switch and ask the guys, 'If it came down to one game, one game to move on to the big show, where would you want to play?' '' Miller said. ''Personally, I would want to play it here and want to play against New York.''</p>
        <p>Miller, almost 35, is one of six Pacers who will become free agents after the season. His message was not lost on the Pacers. ''Reggie's the guy who takes it personal when we don't play well against New York,'' Rose said. ''Everybody knows he doesn't like them, and they don't like him, for that matter.''</p>
        <p>Davis added, ''He wasn't going to be denied.''</p>
        <p>Nor were the rest of the Pacers. For the fourth time in six games, Davis had 16 rebounds. For the second straight game, Indiana's point guards, Mark Jackson and Travis Best, outplayed and outscored Charlie Ward and Chris Childs, combining for 19 points and 8 assists to 12 points and 11 assists for Ward and Childs. Rose scored 11 points, the second-most on the team.</p>
        <p>In the fourth quarter, the Pacers outrebounded the Knicks, 12-4, and limited the Knicks to six field goals and three free throws.</p>
        <p>Bird said: ''Two games ago players were questioning what I was doing, and I told them: 'You got to believe and you got to get up and play harder and if you lay it on the line, it will work. If you are soft, they will take advantage of you.' ''</p>
        <p>He added: ''You hear Jalen say you need some new plays and that's not good, but then they believe in the system and they end up winning two good games.''</p>
        <p>So, for the first time in 10 trips to the playoffs, 4 to the conference finals, the Pacers advanced to the N.B.A. finals. In 1987, the year the Pacers drafted Miller out of U.C.L.A., the Knicks drafted Mark Jackson out of St. John's and Brooklyn. Thirteen seasons later, Jackson had 9 points and 4 assists for Indiana, and he stood on the podium next to his close friend Miller, wiping tears.</p>
        <p>''Reg and I have been talking about this for years and years and years and time and time again, keeping each other up all night long, calling in the middle of the night and wondering how are you feeling,'' Jackson said. ''We have gotten there time and time again, but to finally finish it off was awesome.''</p>
        <p>Sam Perkins, a fellow Brooklyn native, was the only Pacer to have previously reached the finals, with Seattle in 1996. After scoring 6 points and getting 3 of his 4 rebounds in the final 10 minutes Friday night, Perkins could not stop grinning.</p>
        <p>''It's cool,'' he said of winning at New York. ''We kept digging down. All those things going into the season about how old we are'' -- Perkins is the oldest Pacer, just 10 days from his 39th birthday; Rose is the youngest at 27 -- ''we didn't need to be reminded of that. It was just worthwhile for this day. Right now, it's satisfying.''</p>
        <p>The moment will be all too fleeting, though. ''We're not really content -- we've got four games left,'' Perkins said. ''No matter who we play, we'll probably be the underdog.</p>
        <p>''This is what we worked so hard for all year long.''</p>
