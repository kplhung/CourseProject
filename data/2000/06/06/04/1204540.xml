        <p>The place for royal treatment in London is Buckingham Palace, of course. Wrong lineage? Well, 41, a new hotel just down the street at 41 Buckingham Palace Road, may be the next best option.</p>
        <p>This 20-room club-style hotel on the top floor of a five-story Victorian building across from the Royal Mews has been designed as a home-office away from home for movers and shakers. The room rate covers the services of the two staff butlers who are always on duty and a 24-hour buffet of salads, sandwiches, pasta, pizzas and drinks in a mahogany and leather lounge.</p>
