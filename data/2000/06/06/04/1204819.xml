        <p>The 32-year-old Israeli grandmaster Ilya Smirin won the 17th running of the New York International Open Tournament with a 7 1/2-1 1/2 score. He won a $14,000 prize and a porcelain chess set made by Lladro USA, a joint sponsor of the event with Heraldica Imports and Air Europa.</p>
        <p>In this, the pearl of the New York tournament season, held May 5 through May 11 at the New Yorker Hotel, the grandmasters Igor Khenkin of Germany, Nick DeFirmian of the United States, Alexander Goldin of Israel and Alexander Ivanov of Brookline, Mass., tied for second through fifth places with 7-2 scores. Each won $3,500.</p>
        <p>There were 201 entrants, including 38 grandmasters.</p>
        <p>In the final round, Smirin played conservatively, and when he got the chance, he pounced on the international master Aleksandr Grischuk of Russia.</p>
        <p>The ancient Anderssen Attack with 9 d3 is now appearing again on the tournament stage, a century and a half after its introduction.</p>
        <p>The Ruy Lopez is now almost always played with 9 h3, preparing 10 d4 while preventing a pin with . . . Bg4. But if White is going to play the conservative 9 d3, he need not care about bishop pins. His center is not aggressive, but also not vulnerable to attack.</p>
        <p>With 15 d4, White is coming out a tempo behind normal Ruy Lopez development. Once Black achieves parity in the center with 23 . . . d5, his troubles are supposedly ended, but White still retains the initiative.</p>
        <p>After 32 . . . Qc7, Grischuk was weak on the a1-h8 diagonal, although Smirin's work was still cut out for him.</p>
        <p>Smirin's 33 h4! aimed at 34 h5 to further weaken the black king position. Grischuk could not aim for reduction of material with 33 . . . Bf5 because 34 Nf6 Kf8 35 Bf5 Nf5 (35 . . . gf 36 Nd7 Kg8 37 Qf6 will win also) 36 Nd5 either forces 37 Qh8mate or else wins the queen.</p>
        <p>Maybe Grischuk should have played 33 . . . Nd5. Smirin could not then play 34 Rd5? because 34 . . . Qc1 35 Qc1 Rc1 36 Kh2 Bd5 wins for Black. And against 34 h5, Grischuk might have been able to hold out with 34 . . . Qf4.</p>
        <p>But 33 . . . h5 was a difficult path. After 34 Ng5, Grischuk should have tried 34 . . . Rd8, yet after 35 Rd8 Qd8 36 Ne6 Qd1 37 Kh2 fe 38 b4, White still has winning chances.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, 34 . . . Bf5? 35 Qf6! Nd5 36 Qa6 won a decisive pawn for Smirin.</p>
        <p>Grischuk allowed a dangerous pin with 39 . . . b4?! 40 Rd1. After 40 . . . Qc5 41 Qc4 Qd6 42 Qd4, he could not play 42 . . . Qe6 43 Ng5 Qc6 44 Ne4 Rd7, because 45 Qc4! Qb7 46 Rd5! Rd5 47 Nf6 wins a piece.</p>
        <p>His 42 . . . Rd7 walked into 43 Ne5 Rd8 44 Nc4! Qf8 45 Nb6.</p>
        <p>Seeing that 45 . . . Nb6, losing rook for knight after 46 Qd8, was the best he could do, Grischuk gave up.</p>
