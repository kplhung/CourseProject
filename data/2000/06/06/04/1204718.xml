        <p>WITH gasoline prices pushing toward $2 a gallon in some parts of the country, Honda could not have picked a better time to bring out a car that gets 70 miles to the gallon on the highway.

        <p>WITH gasoline prices pushing toward $2 a gallon in some parts of the country, Honda could not have picked a better time to bring out a car that gets 70 miles to the gallon on the highway. Sure enough, the Honda Insight, the first hybrid car to be sold in the United States, is off to a fast start, at least by the standards used to measure alternative vehicles.</p>
        <p>Honda has sold more than 1,100 of the futuristic-looking Insights since the car went on sale in December, and the company recently raised its sales target for this year to 6,500 cars, from 4,000. While even that new goal might seem small, it is double the number of purely electric cars sold by all manufacturers combined in the last few years.</p>
        <p>That raises the question of whether hybrid cars, which combine gasoline engines and electric motors, will provide an alternative to electric vehicles for reducing emissions. The issue is expected to come to a boil in September when the California Air Resources Board considers whether to relax its mandate that starting in 2003, 10 percent of all vehicles sold in the state must give off no emissions or extremely low emissions.</p>
        <p>Even though the Insight became the first product ever honored by the Sierra Club for ''excellence in environmental engineering,'' environmentalists worry that the auto industry will try to argue that hybrids, which still emit low levels of pollutants, should be allowed to substitute for true zero-emission vehicles, weakening air-quality goals.</p>
        <p>The biggest problem with electric vehicles is their limited battery range. The cars can travel only 50 to 100 miles or so before the batteries must be recharged, a process that takes several hours. But a hybrid uses the batteries only to supplement a gasoline engine. Moreover, the batteries can be recharged automatically using power from the gas engine or from braking, so hybrids do not have to be plugged in. Indeed, the Insight rarely has to be taken to a filling station because it can travel 600 miles on a single tank of gas.</p>
        <p>The high mileage comes not just from having batteries carry some of the load. Honda went all out to achieve an eye-popping economy rating, but some of the steps it took ultimately limit the car's appeal.</p>
        <p>The Insight seats only two people. It has only a five-speed manual transmission. Its gas engine is a tiny 1-liter, 3-cylinder, although Honda says that because of the Insight's lightweight aluminum body, aerodynamic design and assistance from the batteries, the Insight behaves like a 1.5-liter subcompact. Finally, the aerodymanic design, with its tapered rear end and skirts over the back wheels, will discourage drivers who don't like to be stared at on the road.</p>
        <p>The Insight might also be vulnerable to competition from the Toyota Prius, another hybrid that goes on sale this month. The Prius gets ''only'' about 50 m.p.g. but seats four or five people and has an automatic transmission; it also received the Sierra Club's engineering award, during the New York auto show in April.</p>
        <p>Toyota executives, in a put-down of the Insight, boast that the Prius is a ''real car'' and say that they hope to sell 12,000 in the first year. The Prius will be priced around $20,000, not much different from the Insight's list price of $18,880 without air-conditioning and $20,080 with it. Both Toyota and Honda are presumed to be losing money on each hybrid they sell.</p>
        <p>The Insight drives pretty much like any other car. One difference, which makes the car eerily quiet, is that the engine shuts off when the car is not moving, the shift is in neutral and the foot is off the clutch. The engine starts up immediately when the clutch is engaged and the car is put in gear.</p>
        <p>Also different is the dashboard, which has some extra displays showing the car's fuel economy at any given instant and providing up and down arrows suggesting when to shift. That makes driving the Insight like playing a video game -- one with the goal of maximum fuel economy. My score was about 45 m.p.g. on fairly empty city streets and 60 on a smoothly flowing highway, below the E.P.A. estimates of 61 in the city and 70 on the highway.</p>
        <p>But despite hybrids' high fuel economy, some environmentalists fear that the vehicles will be used as an excuse to postpone or eliminate California's requirement for zero-emission vehicles.</p>
        <p>The state air resources board is scheduled to review its so-called mandate in September, and lobbying is expected to be fierce. The mandate, which once called for 10 percent of a company's sales to be zero-emission vehicles, has already been weakened twice. It now says that only 4 percent of sales have to be truly emissions-free and the other 6 percent can be extremely low polluting vehicles.</p>
        <p>But automakers say it is next to impossible to meet even the 4 percent target because battery-powered electric vehicles will be the only way to achieve zero emissions by 2003, and those cars have been shunned by consumers. Fuel cells, a new technology for achieving zero emissions, are not expected to be widely available until the second half of the decade.</p>
        <p>While the industry has not yet publicly stated its position, some automakers are expected to argue that a greater improvement in air quality could be achieved by selling a larger number of pretty clean hybrids rather than trying and failing to sell a smaller number of totally clean electrics.</p>
        <p>But environmentalists say the auto companies have not tried hard enough to develop and sell all-electric vehicles, and they don't want hybrids to be used as an excuse to take the pressure off. Hybrids ''are still running on gasoline,'' said Roland Hwang, transportation program director for the Union of Concerned Scientists. ''You still have to have something in the program that says we're moving to zero.''</p>
        <p>Officials of the air resources board have said they hope to keep some of the zero-emission requirement because it has prodded the development not only of electric cars but of hybrids, too. If the mandate is relaxed a third time, electric vehicles might never be commercialized. What California does is expected to be followed by New York and Massachusetts as well, and possibly by some other states.</p>
        <p>But hybrids might not be the total answer either. ''Hybrids are a means of increasing fuel efficiency,'' said Robert J. Bienenfeld, manager of sales and marketing for alternative-fuel vehicles at Honda. ''They are not necessarily the way to approach air-quality regulations.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, the Insight is now classified in California as a ULEV, or ultra-low-emission vehicle, and as such it would not qualify to be counted in the 6 percent of extremely low-emission vehicles that each manufacturer must sell in the state starting in 2003. The Toyota Prius, however, is a SULEV, or super ultra-low emission vehicle, which could qualify if it meets certain other requirements.</p>
        <p>Moreover, while all companies are developing hybrids, some probably won't have them on the market by 2003. Ford has announced that its first hybrid will go on sale that year, a version of its new Escape sport utility. The president of Toyota, Fujio Cho, recently said that his company was working on a hybrid S.U.V., too. DaimlerChrysler is showing off a hybrid Dodge Durango that uses an electric motor not so much for high fuel economy, but to bolster the performance of a gasoline V-6 engine.</p>
        <p>Under the current regulations, SULEV's are given only partial credit toward the emissions goals. It might take three hybrids to count as one zero-emission vehicle in the overall 10 percent goal. Thus, if hybrids are to account for 6 percent of the emissions goal, they will actually have to account for 18 percent of actual sales, which would mean 100,000 hybrids for the top six manufacturers alone. Even with the extra practicality of hybrids, that could be a tough goal to reach, especially if gasoline prices drop.</p>
        <p>''We didn't see this as a mass-market car,'' Mr. Bienenfeld said of the Insight. ''Six months ago, gasoline was $1.10 to $1.15 and no one was walking into a dealership demanding a high-fuel-economy car.''</p>
