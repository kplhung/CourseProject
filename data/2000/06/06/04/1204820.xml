        <p>When a harsh report asserting that torture is widespread in Turkey was released this week, the surprise was not just the amount of damning evidence it contained, but also the source.</p>
        <p>Rather than being prepared by a private advocacy group, the report was the work of the parliamentary committee on human rights.</p>
        <p>For years, Turkish leaders have sought to play down accusations that torture is widely practiced here. That will be harder after what the parliamentary committee found.</p>
        <p>Its report contains transcripts of interviews with many prisoners who said they had been abused. It also includes photos of torture equipment and floor plans that show where torture cells are supposedly located in various police stations. No report by a government human rights body has ever been nearly this extensive or graphic.</p>
        <p>Committee members and investigators interviewed more than 8,500 prisoners during a two-year period. They also conducted unannounced visits to 50 prisons and two dozen police stations, said the vice chairman, Sebgetullah Seydaoglu.</p>
        <p>''This committee has existed for seven years but it hasn't been functioning properly,'' said Mr. Seydaoglu, who represents the southeastern city of Diyarbakir, where the mostly Kurdish population has long complained of bad treatment by police. ''In the last year we've become very decisive about our mission.''</p>
        <p>On Monday, members of the committee presented a copy of their report to the minister of justice, Hikmet Sami Turk. Afterward he said the report ''will hold up a light for us.''</p>
        <p>''Torture is a crime against humanity,'' Mr. Turk said. ''Turkey will resolve this issue. No country can justify torture on the grounds that other countries practice it. Claims of torture will be followed up with resolve. Torture has never been and never will be state policy.''</p>
        <p>The report says that when inmates of Istanbul's main women's prison were interviewed, ''all recounted details of the torture and abuse they suffered.'' Most prisoners interviewed at jails in the eastern cities of Sanliurfa, Erzurum and Erzincan told similar stories.</p>
        <p>European leaders have repeatedly told their Turkish counterparts that Turkey must improve its human rights record if it hopes to join the European Union.</p>
        <p>The United States State Department said in its latest human rights report that during 1999 ''torture, beatings and other abuses by security forces remained widespread, at times resulting in deaths.''</p>
        <p>Human rights advocates are unhappy with the government's record. The bluntness of the new parliamentary report suggests that impatience for change is growing.</p>
        <p>''This report says what we have been saying for years, that torture is extensive and systematic in Turkey,'' said Nazmi Gur, chairman of the Human Rights Association, which has often been at odds with the government. ''This could be the beginning of progress toward meeting European legal standards.''</p>
        <p>Some officials have expressed fear of what might happen if the Turkish police are forced to abandon their traditional methods.</p>
        <p>''People are happy with the performance of the police,'' the deputy interior minister, Sami Sonmez, asserted at a parliamentary hearing last year. ''The police are capable of extracting confessions from the culprits. What's the use of creating a lot of fuss as long as public opinion endorses what the police do?''</p>
