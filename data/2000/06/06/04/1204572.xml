        <p>TIGER WOODS will not tee up at the Buick Classic starting on Thursday at the Westchester Country Club here, but seven of the Pro Golf Association's top-10 players will.</p>
        <p>In fact, the tournament's 34th annual player's list reads like a Who's Who of the pro golf tour. David Duval, Phil Mickelson, Davis Love III, Fred Couples, Paul Azinger, Tom Lehman, Vijay Singh, Jose-Maria Olazabel, Greg Norman, Sergio Garcia and the two-time Classic Champion Ernie Els are all slated to play.</p>
        <p>The tournament is being held this year a week before the U.S. Open, contributing to Woods's absence.</p>
        <p>''Tiger does not like to play tournament golf the week before the Open,'' Peter Mele, the tournament director, said. ''But a lot of players like to play the week before majors to get their games in order.''</p>
        <p>This year's draw of 156 players is much more formidable than last year's, when Duffy Waldorf won the tournament.</p>
        <p>Mele said the golf course here ''has a lot of similarities to a U.S. Open-like golf course -- narrow fairways, hard and fast greens and thick rough.''</p>
        <p>''It's one of the tour's toughest golf courses,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Waldorf won with a score of 276, an 8-under-par performance over four rounds.</p>
        <p>At stake is $2.8 million in prize money, and 120,000 fans are expected to attend.</p>
        <p>The festivities start tomorrow with a Pro-Am Tournament and a celebrity game at 3 p.m. with the former New York Jet lineman Joe Klecko teaming with three P.G.A. tour professionals, and the Olympic skier Franz Klammer, teaming with another three P.G.A. players. Practice rounds begin on Tuesday with the first round of competition starting at 7:10 a.m. on Thursday.</p>
        <p>''We've done a lot this year to make the course spectator friendly,'' Mele said, including adding bleachers at the 16th and 18th greens. ''Golf is really the only professional sport where you can be within an arm's length of a player and watch him hit a shot. Some spectators like to walk 18 holes with their favorite player, and others like to sit all day at the 18th green and watch each group come through.</p>
        <p>''So many people play golf, so they can really relate to what's going on. They can look at the shots and say, 'How would I make it?' and then they can marvel at how the pros make it. But, in general, it's a great place to be outdoors for a whole day -- sit under a tree, watch some beautiful birds fly by, be with your family -- and there happens to be a golf tournament going on.''</p>
        <p>Ticket prices are $35 a day at the gate, $5 for children 6 to 16, free for children under 5 and $27 for senior citizens. Free off-site parking is provided, and shuttle buses are scheduled to make regular runs. Buses will also operate from the Rye train station.</p>
