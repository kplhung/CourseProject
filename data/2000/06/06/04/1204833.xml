        <p>The strike by workers at the Museum of Modern Art has entered its sixth week with no sign of a settlement in sight. The two sides have not held face-to-face negotiations since before the walkout began.</p>
        <p>Union officials assert that the strikers are holding strong even though the museum says 117 of the 250 workers in the bargaining unit have returned to work.</p>
        <p>''I think people are holding up well,'' said Maida Rosenstein, president of Local 2110 of the United Automobile Workers, which represents the museum's assistant curators, bookshop workers, librarians and other administrative workers. ''I think people's resolve has hardened.''</p>
        <p>Each day since the strike began, between 10 and 30 strikers have stood outside the museum, holding signs and urging tourists not to visit. But museum officials say the strike has had little effect on attendance or internal operations.</p>
        <p>A mediator with the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service checks in periodically with the two sides to see whether they are prepared to show new flexibility that would make it worthwhile to bring negotiators together.</p>
        <p>The two sides are divided over numerous issues, including health coverage, wages, job security and the union's demand that all new museum employees be required to join the union or, should they decide not to join, pay the equivalent of union dues. That would create what is known as an agency shop, as opposed to the current open shop, in which workers do not have to join the union or pay dues.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rosenstein said the demand to require museum employees to join the union or pay dues was needed to strengthen the union and give it more leverage against management. But museum officials said they were reluctant to grant that demand because it would give more power to a union that they say has irresponsible leadership.</p>
        <p>''This has not shown itself to be a union whose strength the museum wants to increase,'' said Robert Batterman, the museum's chief negotiator. ''This has shown itself to be a union that's destructive and not to be trusted. The museum is not looking to increase its strength and its sway over the staff.''</p>
        <p>He said the union's leadership has been dishonest in presenting management's bargaining offers to the rank and file -- a charge that Ms. Rosenstein vigorously denies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Batterman predicted that if the union dropped its demand for an agency shop, the two sides would soon be able to settle their other differences.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rosenstein said the museum has rejected the union's demand for an agency shop because the museum wants to prolong the strike to weaken the union. She argued that the museum was being inconsistent in not granting that demand when the six other unions at the museum, including those representing guards, janitors and engineers, have contracts requiring workers to join the union or pay dues.</p>
        <p>''It's a question of simple fairness,'' Ms. Rosenstein said. ''If people are hired into union jobs, they ought to be part of the union. They get all the benefits of the contract. We have to negotiate for them and represent them.''</p>
        <p>She noted that when those workers who do not belong to the union file a grievance, the union has to represent them, a sometimes expensive process that can involve hiring lawyers to handle arbitrations.</p>
        <p>Museum officials said the high percentage of workers who have returned to their jobs shows that the strike is not going well for the union. But Ms. Rosenstein said it was to be expected that many employees would return to work because they are not required to join the union. In most strikes, unions can penalize members who cross the picket line.</p>
        <p>''If we had agency shop in the beginning, we certainly wouldn't have had to go on strike for this long,'' said Eden Schulz, a worker in the museum's permissions department. ''They would have known that 250 members of the bargaining unit would walk out.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Batterman said that since the bargaining unit, known as the Professional and Administrative Staff Association, was formed 30 years ago, the workers have not been required to join the union. He said there was no need to change that system, saying it has worked well.</p>
        <p>Mr. Batterman said that most employees do not join the union, except in the months just before contract negotiations. ''Half the staff doesn't want to be forced to join at any given time, and that's not going to change,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rosenstein said the museum was being anti-union for rejecting the agency shop demand.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Batterman said, ''The museum is the furthest thing from an anti-union employer. This is a matter of history and tradition. This staff insisted on an open shop when it unionized. It's become part of tradition, and the museum is not going to require people to support the union.''</p>
        <p>One assistant curator who crossed the picket line and harshly criticizes the union's leadership said that management was being shortsighted in rejecting the agency shop demand.</p>
        <p>This curator, who insisted on anonymity, said that if all workers had to join the union, then many moderating voices at odds with the union's leadership would then belong to the union, causing the union to be more moderate in negotiations and reducing the likelihood and length of a strike.</p>
