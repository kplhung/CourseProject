        <p>AS a pianist and contemporary composer, Robin Spielberg often tells stories that give her fans glimpses into her life. The liner notes for her eighth CD, ''Beautiful Dreamer,'' tell an intimate and powerful story.</p>
        <p>''Valerie was born too early, and yet, almost too late,'' it begins. ''My physicians performed an emergency C-section to save her from an infection that had just taken the life of her twin sister in utero.'' Ms. Spielberg was 23 weeks pregnant in September 1998 when Valerie was born, weighing just one pound, one ounce -- generally considered the minimum for viability. She was so tiny that Ms. Spielberg's wedding ring could fit over her hand like a bracelet. She spent the next four months in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston. For Ms. Spielberg, 37, who lives in Montclair with her husband, Larry Kosson, a photographer, music was a natural release for the stress.</p>

        <p>AS a pianist and contemporary composer, Robin Spielberg often tells stories that give her fans glimpses into her life. The liner notes for her eighth CD, ''Beautiful Dreamer,'' tell an intimate and powerful story.</p>
        <p>''Valerie was born too early, and yet, almost too late,'' it begins. ''My physicians performed an emergency C-section to save her from an infection that had just taken the life of her twin sister in utero.'' Ms. Spielberg was 23 weeks pregnant in September 1998 when Valerie was born, weighing just one pound, one ounce -- generally considered the minimum for viability. She was so tiny that Ms. Spielberg's wedding ring could fit over her hand like a bracelet. She spent the next four months in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston. For Ms. Spielberg, 37, who lives in Montclair with her husband, Larry Kosson, a photographer, music was a natural release for the stress.</p>
        <p>Ms. Spielberg, who has toured nationally and is scheduled for her third Carnegie Hall performance this week, says her life is deeply entwined with her art. ''There is no way this particular experience could not have an effect,'' she said.</p>
        <p>At home, Ms. Spielberg played songs she hoped could reach a baby too fragile to be comforted by the usual nursing or cuddling, tacking Post-It notes with the song titles to the 1962 Steinway in her living room. She brought recordings of her soothing, gentle music to the hospital and noticed that not only Valerie, but also all the other babies in earshot, seemed to respond to it amid the blips, beeps and jarring alarms that make up the unit's ambient noise.</p>
        <p>Dr. Teresa Stec, an attending neonatalogist at St. Barnabas, said parents often make recordings of the sounds they wish to share with their premature babies in their isolettes. ''I have parents playing classical music, parents playing Led Zeppelin for their baby, parents reading nursery rhymes, singing to the baby, whatever,'' she said.</p>
        <p>A report in The Journal of the American Medical Association in January cited a study that found that music played for premature infants ''improves oxygen saturation levels, increases weight gain and shortens the duration of hospital stay.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Spielberg recorded Valerie's music as ''Beautiful Dreamer,'' billed as ''solo piano lullabies for parent and child.'' The CD came out in March on North Star Records.</p>
        <p>''It was natural for me, making this for Valerie,'' Ms. Spielberg said.</p>
        <p>Most of the songs she chose for the album were those she had loved as a child, like ''Puff the Magic Dragon'' and ''On Top of Old Smokey,'' stirred back into her consciousness when she became a mother. Others had special meaning for her, like ''The Water Is Wide,'' an Irish melody about lovers on opposite sides of the water, unable to cross. ''It was about pulling through,'' she said. ''I've been playing it a lot in concert and people have been really moved.''</p>
        <p>Valerie underwent 13 blood transfusions and heart surgery. ''In addition to grieving for Valerie's sister and it being touch and go with her, my mother was in this horrible accident and her whole arm was shattered,'' Ms. Spielberg said. ''I was driving my father back and forth to his chemo because he was diagnosed with cancer.'' She said she didn't know what her husband ''was made of until this happened.''</p>
        <p>Sometimes the intensive care unit's staff introduced her to a healthy 4- or 5-year-old and told her how little the child had weighed at birth. Valerie visited the unit on her first birthday, and her mother said, ''the doctor called out another mother and said: 'See this baby? She was 17 ounces.' ''</p>
        <p>Valerie, now more than 17 pounds, has physical therapy three times a week, but she can feed herself Cheerios, walk holding onto furniture and say simple words like baby and kitty. Dr. Stec, the director of the hospital's high-risk infant follow-up program, said, ''so far everything is coming out perfectly normal.''</p>
        <p>While Dr. Stec would not say whether the music helped the baby thrive, she said, ''If it helps mothers relax and bond with the baby, we're definitely all for that.''</p>
