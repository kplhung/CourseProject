        <p>AMERICAN PHARAOH</p>
        <p>Mayor Richard J. Daley: His Battle</p>
        <p>for Chicago and the Nation.</p>
        <p>By Adam Cohen and Elizabeth Taylor.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 614 pp. Boston:</p>
        <p>Little, Brown &amp; Company. $26.95.</p>
        <p>TWENTY-FIVE years ago, Richard J. Daley won his sixth and last election as mayor of Chicago. His control of the city was still secure, but his national image could not have been much worse. He was widely perceived as a sleazy and intolerant autocrat, a man who stole votes and ordered the police to beat up antiwar protesters in the streets. Some of his closest political confidants were under indictment on corruption charges, and many of them would ultimately go to prison. When he died in the fall of 1976, it was with the weariness of a beleaguered and discouraged man.</p>
        <p>But time has come through splendidly for him. As the centennial of his birth approaches, a poll of political scientists has selected Daley as the single best mayor of the late 20th century and one of the 10 best in American history. Daleys son reigns virtually unchallenged as his mayoral successor. At a moment when managerial efficiency has replaced social activism as the central value of local government, the phrase ''Boss Daley has lost the evil connotation for most people that it seemed to have a quarter-century ago.</p>
        <p>Adam Cohen and Elizabeth Taylor have produced a splendid, serious treatment of Daleys life, the first full-length biography of one of the most fascinating and enigmatic characters of modern American political history. ''American Pharaoh deals in the subtleties and complexities of a man whose closest associates insisted they did not really understand him very well. Daley was obsessed with competence and order but operated a political machine larded with hacks, waste and inefficiency. He was personally honest to a fault but allowed those around him to take almost anything they wanted. He was blunt, forceful and pithy in private conversation, yet embarrassingly inarticulate in public.</p>
        <p>Those were riddles in Daleys lifetime, and ''American Pharaoh does not really answer them -- it drops no bombs and adds few juicy anecdotes to the existing trove of Daley stories. The time for such revelations may well have passed: Daleys contemporaries are nearly all gone, and his machine, like all such organizations, left a very meager paper trail. There is no significant storehouse of sensitive Daley documents for historians to comb through.</p>
        <p>But if this is not a work of startling disclosure, it is a scrupulously thorough and readable examination of the important issues of a long political life. It is also a valuable introduction to the intricacies of Chicago politics over several decades. Unlike previous Daleyologists, the authors of ''American Pharaoh are not locals: Taylor, the literary editor and Sunday magazine editor of The Chicago Tribune, grew up in New Jersey; Cohen, a senior writer at Time magazine, is from New York. They occasionally stumble over small details, such as whether Halsted is a street or an avenue. But for the most part, they demonstrate an impressive sensitivity to local nuance. They pick up on the cultural differences between blacks on the West Side and the South Side, and the postwar rivalry between working-class and middle-class Irish politicians. They approach the evidence with a dispassionate and balanced quality that no homegrown student of Daleys life has been able to achieve.</p>
        <p>Daley was a man who loved tidiness, in things large and small. He was obsessive about details and hated loose ends. As chairman of the Cook County Democratic Committee, he operated a political machine that was expected to perform with precision in every one of the citys more than 3,000 precincts, and he checked the votes to make sure it did. As a newly elected mayor, he vowed that every street in the city would be swept once a month, and ordered 2,000 signs and 10,000 decals promoting the cleanliness campaign. He sometimes stopped his limousine to pick up a newspaper littering the streets.</p>
        <p>Like quite a few of the legendary bosses of American politics, he was essentially a dour, inward-looking man, no natural practitioner of ''Last Hurrah conviviality. ''Daley was a gregarious loner, the authors write, ''acquainted with thousands of people but close to almost none. Social life was a means for him, not an end.</p>
        <p>What it was a means to, nobody who knew him doubted. Daley realized early in life that he desired power, and he was willing to wait patiently for the opportunity to exercise it. He spent three decades toiling quietly at the routine jobs of urban machine politics -- as secretary to an alderman, as a functionary in the county treasurers office, as a state legislator, as county clerk. He was 53 years old when the chance to run for mayor finally arrived, in the spring of 1955. By then he had maneuvered himself into the chairmanship of the countys Democratic Party, so he could essentially anoint himself for the job. As the official candidate of the party organization, he had little difficulty winning nomination against the citys ineffectual two-term reform mayor, Martin J. Kennelly, and election against a good-government Republican. It was on election night, April 5, 1955, that Alderman Paddy Bauler danced a jig and uttered his famous pronouncement, ''Chicago aint ready for reform!</p>
        <p>Once in office, Daley presented skeptics with a few pleasant surprises. He stripped the citys aldermen of some of their most egregious perquisites, like the right to demand payoffs for home improvement permits, and hired professionally trained outsiders for some of the more sensitive staff positions in planning and financial management. But he also left little doubt about his intention to run things in an autocratic way. During the campaign, Daley had promised that if he became mayor, he would give up the party chairmanship rather than trying to perform both jobs. After the election, as Cohen and Taylor put it, he ''conveniently forgot his promise. Uniting City Hall and the massive Cook County political machine under his own control was a temptation to power that Daley was simply unable to pass up. ''He ruled over his empire with pharaonic power, the authors write, ''the kind of absolute power that few American politicians have ever wielded.</p>
        <p>This is debatable. When it came to pure political power, there is no disputing that Daley was indeed a Pharaoh. The Cook County Democratic Party had a candidate slating committee, but when it met, in a smoky conclave at the old downtown La Salle Hotel, Daley told it whom to slate. The City Council passed the ordinances that Daley wished to enact, and no others. Among its 50 members, there were rarely as many as 10 dissenting votes. But the question of broader governmental power is more complex. Chicago in the Daley years was no monolith -- it was a network of interlocking institutions, social, financial, ethnic -- and even a leader as strong as Daley found himself brokering as often as dictating. Moving a budget through the City Council may have been a slam dunk; building a convention center or a hospital, or redeveloping a blighted section of downtown Chicago was almost as tough a job for him as it was for other mayors around the country.</p>
        <p>A close reading of ''American Pharaoh makes it abundantly clear that for all his legendary clout, Daley spent much of his time maneuvering his way among competing forces that no true Ramses would have had to contend with. The Mafia was a good example. The citys crime bosses cooperated with Daley; Mafia-dominated wards provided much of the vote that allowed him to win his first nomination. On the other hand, there is equal evidence that Daley considered the mob an embarrassment to the city and to his own public reputation. ''Its there, the authors quote the mayor as saying, ''and you know you cant get rid of it, so you have to live with it. But never let it become so strong that it dominates you.</p>
        <p>The precise nature of Daleys relationship with organized crime is one of many riddles that the book does not fully resolve and cannot reasonably be expected to resolve after all these years. So is the issue of the 1960 presidential election: Did the Daley machine, as is widely suspected, steal Illinoiss 27 electoral votes for John F. Kennedy? Taylor and Cohen sift patiently through the evidence, document in impressive fashion just how votes could be manufactured, and conclude that the accusations of theft are perfectly plausible -- but unprovable.</p>
        <p>''American Pharaoh is equally impressive on another of the climactic events of Daleys career: the disastrous Democratic National Convention held in Chicago in 1968. Daleys handling of the convention has always been difficult to understand. He opposed the Vietnam War and had urged President Lyndon Johnson to disengage from it as early as 1966. Yet Daley allowed his police to abuse and assault thousands of young people who came to the convention city to support his own private view. The books recounting of the convention chaos is detailed, fair and riveting to read. The authors make it clear that by the time the convention took place, Daley had come to see the protests as a challenge not to the war but to the sense of order and traditional social values that were crucial to him. And so he overreacted.</p>
        <p>The convention stands as one of the two most lasting embarrassments to Daleys memory; the other is the high-rise public housing projects that by the end of his life had turned into segregated, crime-ridden failures. Taylor and Cohen hold him personally accountable, with considerable justification, for the decisions that concentrated Chicagos public housing along a small strip of the black South Side, rather than dispersing it around the city. ''Instead of healthy integrated neighborhoods, the authors write, ''the South and West sides ended up with a single black ghetto that engulfed communities in its path.</p>
        <p>If the vertical ghettoes of the South Side represent the worst of the Daley legacy, other buildings that he created are the best of that legacy. Like great mayors in virtually all times and places, Daley was a builder. He inherited a drab and unambitious city that had seen virtually no public construction in two decades, and he used his power to restore it to physical vitality. The revival of the Loop commercial and financial district, the emergence of Michigan Avenue as a retail and entertainment magnet for millions of visitors a year, the affluent downtown residential population that cities all over America are now desperate to create -- all of these trace back, in one way or another, to Richard J. Daley.</p>
        <p>There was a great deal not to like about the man and his policies, but for most Chicagoans, looking back on his era with a quarter-century of perspective, there is also a bottom line: Chicago might have become another Detroit, a national symbol of urban failure, and it did not. Cohen and Taylor, as critical of the mayors faults as anyone who has written about him, nevertheless pay him the ultimate compliment: ''Daley, they bluntly state, ''may well have saved Chicago.</p>
        <p>But perhaps the most fitting summation is the one the authors provide in a story about Daley and Adlai E. Stevenson III, a sometime critic and sometime protege. In 1970, after denouncing the mayor for his patronage excesses and police brutality, Stevenson gladly accepted Daleys endorsement for the Senate. ''Stevenson said Daley was a feudal boss, a joke had it. ''He didnt say he was a bad feudal boss. Cohen and Taylor cant quite bring themselves to say it either.</p>
