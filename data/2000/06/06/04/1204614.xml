        <p>THE gang is all here at what seems like a campy garden party. There is the hot dog vendor, the lumberjack, the bowler, the sword swallower, the running back, the construction worker, the bicyclist and the cowboy. Weightlifters, firefighters and sanitation workers make appearances. Balzac, Joseph Beuys, Davy Crockett, Joe DiMaggio, Piet Mondrian, Henry Moore, and David Smith mingle with the anonymous characters from ordinary American life. All these subjects by Red Grooms, an internationally acclaimed contemporary sculptor, have come together for this exhibition.</p>
        <p>''Red Grooms is one of my favorites,'' said Brooke Barrie, the director and curator of Grounds for Sculpture. She selected 40 sculptures and 3 drawings for display, offering a retrospective survey of the artist's career over the past two decades. Even though the sculptor's exhibition history dates from the late 1950's, Ms. Barrie said this show of individual objects, dating from about 1980, was the ''artist's first solo exhibition of sculpture.'' Her statement requires some clarification. She does not consider any exhibitions at galleries or museums that were exclusively devoted to Mr. Grooms's walk-in environmental installations, which he calls ''sculpto-pictoramas,'' like ''Ruckus Manhattan'' (1975-76), his large-scale multimedia construction of lower Manhattan that has the character of a stage set.</p>

        <p>THE gang is all here at what seems like a campy garden party. There is the hot dog vendor, the lumberjack, the bowler, the sword swallower, the running back, the construction worker, the bicyclist and the cowboy. Weightlifters, firefighters and sanitation workers make appearances. Balzac, Joseph Beuys, Davy Crockett, Joe DiMaggio, Piet Mondrian, Henry Moore, and David Smith mingle with the anonymous characters from ordinary American life. All these subjects by Red Grooms, an internationally acclaimed contemporary sculptor, have come together for this exhibition.</p>
        <p>''Red Grooms is one of my favorites,'' said Brooke Barrie, the director and curator of Grounds for Sculpture. She selected 40 sculptures and 3 drawings for display, offering a retrospective survey of the artist's career over the past two decades. Even though the sculptor's exhibition history dates from the late 1950's, Ms. Barrie said this show of individual objects, dating from about 1980, was the ''artist's first solo exhibition of sculpture.'' Her statement requires some clarification. She does not consider any exhibitions at galleries or museums that were exclusively devoted to Mr. Grooms's walk-in environmental installations, which he calls ''sculpto-pictoramas,'' like ''Ruckus Manhattan'' (1975-76), his large-scale multimedia construction of lower Manhattan that has the character of a stage set.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grooms's imagery demonstrates a fondness for Americana. Various forms of entertainment have fascinated the artist, but since childhood he has been interested in carnivals and circuses. How apt that his fun-filled, energetic and humorous images are displayed in the Museum Building, originally built in the 1940's as exhibition space for the New Jersey State Fair. Because the brightly painted sculptures are not arranged in any chronological sequence and are not grouped by theme, it takes a little time to get oriented to the exhibition's syncopated rhythm. A viewer might feel like a late arrival at the Grand Ole Opry.</p>
        <p>''The Strike,'' a mixed-media composition, possesses all the anecdotal and theatrical elements typically associated with Mr. Grooms's sculpture. Wearing the quintessential bowling shirt that advertises a towing service, Ed (his name appears on the shirt) throws a ball down the highly polished, undulating alley. It is understandable why Mr. Grooms has been dubbed the ''Bernini of Pop Art.'' ''Davy Crockett'' and ''Hot Dog Horse'' are cast fiberglass replicas of 2 of the 36 figures that were originally created for the ''Tennessee Fox Trot Carousel,'' a public sculpture installed in 1998 at Riverfront Park in Nashville, the artist's hometown. All the seats of this amusement ride cleverly relate to characters from Tennessee history. The palette of vibrant colors is appropriate in this context. The artist has said, ''Color is just about as dangerous as political correctness.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Grooms has been strongly influenced by the tradition of American woodcarving. ''Joltin' Joe Takes a Swing'' is a painted wood sculpture of Joe DiMaggio. The carving is deliberately done to give the piece the whittled look of folk art. Like a large, three-dimensional illustration, the stopped action is so convincing that a viewer could almost hear the umpire calling the strike. On the other hand, one of the oldest works on display is ''Lumberjack,'' which has the deceptive appearance of a wood construction that might have been made by someone who was never out of Appalachia, but it is actually cast (at the Johnson Atelier) in bronze. Several sculptures by Mr. Grooms are painted bronze, a significant change from the artist's earlier and more casual use of less precious materials, like cardboard, paper and plaster.</p>
        <p>''Western Eagle'' is one of the most political works in this show, but the painted bronze raises its issues with a dose of humor. Mr. Grooms inventively plays with multiculturalism to comment on the advance of American civilization, which is represented by housing developments, commercial enterprises and an oil well. With traditional political symbols, American Indian imagery and corporate logos, the artist presents the loss of the Old West.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grooms also creates amusing three-dimensional caricatures of famous artists. The largest work in the gallery is ''Henry Moore in a Sheep Meadow,'' a clever homage to the English sculptor. Moore is presented as one of his large recumbent figures in an outdoor setting that includes a shepherd and several sheep positioned on both the front and backsides of the sculpture.</p>
        <p>Another tribute to a major 20th-century sculptor is ''David Smith,'' which depicts the artist welding (real tanks, a welding mask and clamps are incorporated) a sculpture on a base that is directly imitative of Smith's Voltri series.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grooms acknowledges artistic influences as varied as Norman Rockwell and Ernst Ludwig Kirchner. He uses elements from both high and low art to celebrate the joyous quality of life. The artist admits that his mother ''tried to stimulate some sense of taste and appropriateness.''</p>
        <p>''I don't know where I went wrong,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In the Domestic Arts Building, Bill Barrett and Andrzej Pitynski are both having one-person shows. Given the strong artistic personality of Red Grooms, these two sculptors have a difficult time trying to command attention. Mr. Barrett is represented by 12 sculptures and 14 paintings of abstract forms. A bronze, like ''Embrace,'' has a strongly choreographic quality. With its play on positive and negative spaces, his sculpture of interconnected organic shapes immediately brings to mind the work of Isaac Witkin. Mr. Pitynski's most impressive sculpture is not displayed in the upstairs gallery with his small group of drawings and bronzes. ''The Partisans II -- Freedom Fighters'' has been installed on a hill overlooking Klockner Road, the major approach from Route 295 to Grounds for Sculpture. Like sentinels, the five equestrian figures in cast aluminum are a dramatic presence along the tracks of the Northeast Corridor. All three artists in this spring exhibition reveal how the park is an idyllic destination for anyone interested in the varied forms of contemporary sculpture.</p>
