        <p>With as much relief as enthusiasm, New York's Conservative and Liberal Parties reverted to type today, endorsing Rick A. Lazio and Hillary Rodham Clinton for the Senate after both parties had endured a queasy several months that had left their nominations in doubt.</p>
        <p>Less than two weeks into his campaign, Mr. Lazio, a congressman little known beyond his district in Long Island, has been working to establish himself in voters' minds as a centrist, but today his campaign veered to the right.

        <p>With as much relief as enthusiasm, New York's Conservative and Liberal Parties reverted to type today, endorsing Rick A. Lazio and Hillary Rodham Clinton for the Senate after both parties had endured a queasy several months that had left their nominations in doubt.</p>
        <p>Less than two weeks into his campaign, Mr. Lazio, a congressman little known beyond his district in Long Island, has been working to establish himself in voters' minds as a centrist, but today his campaign veered to the right. Addressing the Conservative Party's nominating convention at a hotel a few blocks from the state Capitol, he promised ''a crusade,'' offering up a list of favorite conservative causes, like tax cuts, the death penalty, longer prison terms and greater military spending.</p>
        <p>He also spoke of the issue most identified with the Conservatives in recent years: what opponents call partial-birth abortion. ''There is no place in our society for the gruesome procedure partial-birth abortion,'' he said to enthusiastic applause.</p>
        <p>A few hours earlier, at the Hotel Inter-Continental in Manhattan, where Mrs. Clinton accepted the Liberal Party endorsement, she and the state party's leader, Raymond B. Harding, said Mr. Lazio was more conservative than the man he replaced as the Republican candidate, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York.</p>
        <p>''In many ways my views are closer to those of the mayor than those of my opponent,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''He is out of step with the mainstream.</p>
        <p>''My views are centrist views, positive views,'' she added at a news conference.</p>
        <p>The day's events highlighted the danger to Mr. Lazio -- that the Conservative Party's backing can be both an aid and a burden -- as both candidates try to claim the political middle ground. Unlike the Liberals, the Conservatives still hew to an ideology in keeping with their name, taking strong stands against abortion, gay rights, affirmative action and big government. And the party's ready embrace of Mr. Lazio as a real conservative contrasts sharply with its rejection of Mr. Giuliani as too moderate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio said nothing to distance himself from the Conservative Party, even as he obliquely acknowledged that the affiliation could be used against him. ''The other side is going to try to demonize me,'' he said. ''They're going to try to demonize you, too.''</p>
        <p>He also peppered his speech with attacks on Mrs. Clinton, who barely mentioned him today. ''You won't catch us trying to nationalize one-seventh of our economy,'' Mr. Lazio said, a reference to Mrs. Clinton's failed plan to restructure the nation's health care system. He reminded his audience several times that Mrs. Clinton was new to New York, saying, ''I was able to jump into this race without a listening tour because I've been listening to New York all my life.''</p>
        <p>Of Mrs. Clinton, he said, ''She comes to New York with the support of every left-wing special-interest group, from Washington insiders to the Hollywood elite.''</p>
        <p>As long as Mr. Giuliani was the presumptive Republican nominee, the race had both the Liberal and Conservative Parties in turmoil. The Liberals, whose longstanding support of Mr. Giuliani had alienated many Democrats, faced an internal battle over which side to take.</p>
        <p>The state Conservative Party chairman, Michael L. Long, vowed that his party would not support the mayor because he was not conservative enough, especially on abortion. Party leaders said they would nominate someone to Mr. Giuliani's right, even if undermining him meant helping Mrs. Clinton and damaging the Conservatives' relationship with the Republican Party. But the Conservatives were having some trouble finding a candidate of their own.</p>
        <p>But when Mr. Giuliani dropped out of the race last month, and the Republicans nominated Mr. Lazio, the battle lines became clear and the Liberals and Conservatives fell into their comfortable old roles as contentious allies of the major parties.</p>
        <p>Conservative delegates said today that they were relieved to be able to unite with the Republicans, and, one after another, they said abortion was the key issue. ''Abortion is the big difference between Lazio and Giuliani,'' said Viola Hunter of Syracuse, the party's vice chairwoman. ''We're not a one-issue party, but it is a very vital, important issue.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio supports legal abortion, but unlike Mrs. Clinton -- and Mr. Giuliani -- he opposes government financing for it, and would ban what he calls partial-birth abortion.</p>
        <p>In nominating Mrs. Clinton, the Liberal Party went some distance toward mending its frayed relationship with the Democratic Party. The Liberals had alienated many Democrats by backing the mayor, and by refusing to support the Democratic nominee for governor in 1998, Peter F. Vallone, and instead nominating Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross.</p>
        <p>The Conservative Party has fewer than 2 percent of the state's registered voters, and the Liberal Party fewer than 1 percent, but they wield an influence beyond their size. In recent statewide elections, Republican candidates have pulled as many as 300,000 votes on the Conservative line, while Democrats often get well over 100,000 on the Liberal line.</p>
