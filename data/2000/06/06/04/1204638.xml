        <p>ALL week, our old farmhouse in Maryland has been full of the smell of mock oranges and fragrant roses drifting through the kitchen window. The big double purple and white lilacs, which my grandmother brought here shortly after she eloped at 16, filled the house with their intoxicating scent weeks ago. And now, I am digging up some of their suckers to make a new border along the old vegetable patch.</p>
        <p>I'm devoting at least half of the old truck patch -- a rectangle 100 by 40 feet -- to cut flowers, growing them in long farmer rows, alongside rows of pole beans and potatoes. The farmer in me revels in the usefulness of these long, wide rows of plants, which can be cut with abandon without worrying about bare stems in the border. The more you cut many of these flowers, the more they bloom.</p>

        <p>ALL week, our old farmhouse in Maryland has been full of the smell of mock oranges and fragrant roses drifting through the kitchen window. The big double purple and white lilacs, which my grandmother brought here shortly after she eloped at 16, filled the house with their intoxicating scent weeks ago. And now, I am digging up some of their suckers to make a new border along the old vegetable patch.</p>
        <p>I'm devoting at least half of the old truck patch -- a rectangle 100 by 40 feet -- to cut flowers, growing them in long farmer rows, alongside rows of pole beans and potatoes. The farmer in me revels in the usefulness of these long, wide rows of plants, which can be cut with abandon without worrying about bare stems in the border. The more you cut many of these flowers, the more they bloom.</p>
        <p>This is also where I will put those mangy-looking tulips, now that they have bloomed so heftily in the big pots by the kitchen door and in the perennial garden. Lifting them makes room for summer blooms, like the scabiosa and Russian sage I'm putting in the pots, and all the oreganos, lavenders, salvias and you-name-its I can't stop collecting.</p>
        <p>At first, I thought I'd give my bulbs a home for the summer while they fattened up on all that food manufactured in the leaves. But now I think I'll leave them right where they are, to bloom as cut flowers next spring. And I'll add about 100 more, to have plenty for cutting. Ridiculous as it sounds, this is the best time to order bulbs for fall. The memory of the ones that worked is still in your mind, and there are hefty discounts for orders placed before July 1.</p>
        <p>I've ordered a lot of flamed Darwins, like Orange Bowl (red petals licked with orange), Burning Heart (cream with blood red) and Ad Rem (a huge red orange with gleaming gold edges), to name only a few, and Princess Irene, the single early deep-orange tulip with dark red, which is always sold out.</p>
        <p>Summer bulbs are also essential to a good workhorse cut-flower garden. Giant Dutch irises -- I have Blue Ribbon, Purple Sensation and White Perfection -- grow as high as 18 inches and are handsome all by themselves in a tall vase. Spuria irises, which look like butterflies, range in color from lemon yellow to burnt orange and lilac blue.</p>
        <p>I'm not crazy about big gladioluses, but I like more delicate types, like Gladiolus communis Byzantinus, the corn lily, which blooms with the first roses and peonies. Acidanthera, from Africa, is like gladiolus, but has spikes of white, four-inch fragrant flowers with maroon throats. It has a three-foot stem and lasts well in a vase. Gladiolus gandavensis, a French heirloom, is pale yellow, with red in the center. The three-foot spikes bloom in June and July.</p>
        <p>Oriental lilies also make terrific cut flowers, in moderation. One is all you need to intoxicate the guests. I planted Casa Blanca about six years ago, and the plants are spreading to the size of a small hippopotamus.</p>
        <p>There's still time to plant seeds of annuals in the ground. I've also ordered some flats through the catalogs, just to see how they work. And I binge at my local nurseries, of course. I tell myself it's for research, but it's really addiction.</p>
        <p>I have a lot of old-favorite annuals, like Firecracker zinnias and the cut-and-come-again doubles you can find almost anywhere. Also cleome, or spider flower, which has a globe-shape flower head, full of delicate white, rose or purple petals and dangling seedpods, which look more like cat whiskers than spider legs to me, but anyway. Helen Campbell is a reliable bloomer and a prolific self-seeder, but just deadhead, or snap off the flower heads, if you're worried about its spreading elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Cosmos is another workhorse, with tall billowy stems and single-petal flowers, and the more you cut, the more will grow. It now comes in many shades: orange, chocolate, pink-and-white striped. But don't order the dwarf variety by mistake.</p>
        <p>Lavatera, with satiny, cup-shape blooms in white or pink with darker pink veining, is another flower that lasts well in a vase. It's tricky getting it to germinate, so keep the soil moist, and don't let the seedlings dry out. But once it gets going, it's tough and drought-tolerant.</p>
        <p>Lisianthus, a prairie native that thrives in heat, has delicate cup-shape flowers that range in color from white to deep purple.</p>
        <p>Campanula persicifolia, with its spikes of blue and white cup-shape flowers, will rebloom when cut, and it also self-sows. So does Verbena bonariensis, whose purplish-pink flowers bloom on airy five-foot stems.</p>
        <p>I love my trusty perennials, like purple and white coneflowers, blanketflowers, Shasta daisies, black-eyed Susans, monardas, verbascums and all the yarrows, which now come in deep red and orange yellow.</p>
        <p>Think of accents, too, like a bit of Blackie, the ebony-purple sweet potato vine, Ipomoea batatas, or its chartreuse cousin, Margarita. The delicate greenish-yellow blossoms of lady's mantle, as well as flowering dill, will lend an edge of interest.</p>
        <p>Don't forget sunflowers, which are hogs in the garden, but the finches love them. Just a few look gorgeous in a tall urn, and their faces are eerily expressive. My favorites include Tithonia, the orange Mexican sunflower; Velvet Queen, a dark burgundy with charcoal-color disks; and Italian White, a six-footer with chocolate centers banded with gold.</p>
        <p>I'm trying Penstemon eriantherus this year, a drought-tolerant Midwestern species. It has dark-burgundy foliage on dark, three-foot stems, with white or bluish flowers. You can never have enough salvias, even if you have to plant them every year.</p>
        <p>And don't forget Nicotiana alata, the white flowering tobacco, which smells like jasmine. N. sylvestris is the jolly tall one, which looks terrific in a vase. N. landsdorffii is the green bellflower tobacco, but N. alata will make the guests swoon.</p>
