        <p>California's men's heavyweight varsity repeated as national collegiate champion, successfully defending its Intercollegiate Rowing Association title yesterday in Cherry Hill, N.J., with a finesse that left the five other boats in the final to battle for the runner-up spot.</p>
        <p>Top-seeded Cal paced itself against second-seeded Brown for the first 1,000 meters of the 2,000-meter Cooper River course, then in 10 strokes drew away from the Bruins. Cal cruised home in 5 minutes 39.5 seconds, a full five seconds, or more than a boat length, ahead of Brown.</p>

        <p>California's men's heavyweight varsity repeated as national collegiate champion, successfully defending its Intercollegiate Rowing Association title yesterday in Cherry Hill, N.J., with a finesse that left the five other boats in the final to battle for the runner-up spot.</p>
        <p>Top-seeded Cal paced itself against second-seeded Brown for the first 1,000 meters of the 2,000-meter Cooper River course, then in 10 strokes drew away from the Bruins. Cal cruised home in 5 minutes 39.5 seconds, a full five seconds, or more than a boat length, ahead of Brown.</p>
        <p>Princeton fell three-tenths of a second short of Brown for third. Washington lost to Cal for the fourth time this season, finishing fourth, followed by Temple and Dartmouth.</p>
        <p>Cal defeated Washington and Wisconsin to capture the freshmen race, but placed fourth in the junior varsity contest, giving Brown the only East Coast victory in the heavyweight races.</p>
        <p>Yale's men's lightweight varsity won the closest finish of the day, avenging an 0.11-second loss to Columbia two weeks ago in the Eastern Sprints. The top four finishers were within a second of one another, with the Elis winning in 5:30.39.</p>
