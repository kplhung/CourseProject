        <p>Gary Sheffield homered twice, drove in four runs and scored three yesterday as Los Angeles beat the Angels, 8-3, in Anaheim.</p>
        <p>Sheffield went 3 for 4, including a three-run homer off Brian Cooper (2-1) in the first inning and a solo shot in the third. Sheffield, who has 17 homers this season, had the 17th multihomer game of his career.</p>
        <p>Chan Ho Park (6-4) gave up three runs and eights hits in five and two-thirds innings, struck out seven and walked four.</p>
        <p>Cooper, a rookie right-hander, allowed six runs and eight hits in seven innings.</p>
        <p>ATHLETICS 9, GIANTS 7: Matt Stairs hit a three-run homer in the seventh inning and drove in four runs as host Oakland overcame a pair of homers by Barry Bonds.</p>
        <p>Bonds homered in the first and fifth innings, giving him the major-league lead with 22. Oakland extended its winning streak to four.</p>
        <p>A's Manager Art Howe presented the lineup card dressed in a suit and straw hat in honor of Connie Mack, selected as the Athletics' manager of the century yesterday.</p>
        <p>RANGERS 4, DIAMONDBACKS 3: Chad Curtis hit a two-run homer and Kenny Rogers pitched six solid innings for host Texas.</p>
        <p>Rogers (5-5) scattered four hits and struck out five. He has lasted at least six innings in all 11 starts this season. John Wetteland pitched the ninth for his 14th save. He has converted 11 straight chances, a team record.</p>
        <p>PADRES 7, MARINERS 4: Stan Spencer came within one out of his first major league complete game and Ryan Klesko hit a two-run homer to lead visiting San Diego.</p>
        <p>Spencer (2-1), making his fifth start since being called up from Triple-A Las Vegas on May 12, allowed a two-run homer to Mike Cameron in the sixth.</p>
        <p>Edgar Martinez (17th) and Jay Buhner (12th) hit solo homers in the ninth. After Brian Boehringer walked David Bell, Trevor Hoffman got the final out for his 13th save in 14 chances.</p>
