        <p>Coolidge, the 30th president of the United States, said he couldn't recall that any presidential candidate hurt himself much by not talking. When a woman bet a friend that she could pry more than two words out of Coolidge, he told her, ''You lose.''</p>

        <p>FOR anyone weary of the glitz and spin of modern presidential campaigns and longing for a quieter time when American presidents wore hats and spared the electorate their confessions, it may be time to repair, as my wife, Jaqueline, and I did, to Plymouth Notch, the Vermont birthplace and home of Silent Cal, as Calvin Coolidge was nicknamed by contemporaries.</p>
        <p>Coolidge, the 30th president of the United States, said he couldn't recall that any presidential candidate hurt himself much by not talking. When a woman bet a friend that she could pry more than two words out of Coolidge, he told her, ''You lose.''</p>
        <p>Stories about Coolidge and his thrifty, taciturn clan abound in Plymouth Notch, a community of tidy white clapboard farmhouses and weathered barns that look unchanged since Coolidge was sworn in here as president in 1923. And that's another good reason to visit Plymouth Notch, for it is a near-perfect model of a Vermont village almost a century ago.</p>
        <p>Isolated in the rugged heartland of the Green Mountains, Plymouth Notch has been called Vermont's Brigadoon, after the imaginary Scottish village that appears and vanishes in the mists. Because the major highways and their attendant filling stations, convenience stores and strip malls bypassed Plymouth Notch, it never needed restoration, explained William Jenney, a museum historian who administers the Calvin Coolidge State Historic Site on behalf of the Vermont Division for Historic Preservation. ''The village was not restored, but preserved,'' Mr. Jenney said.</p>
        <p>Nestled in a pocket of farmland under a panorama of wooded hills rising to 2,200 feet, Plymouth Notch is accessible by Route 100A, a secondary road winding between the resort towns of Ludlow and Woodstock in the ski country of central Vermont. Plymouth Notch can be seen in two hours or less, but it would be a shame to leave before lingering for a picnic and a walk along trails through the meadows.</p>
        <p>Jaqueline and I cheated on the recommended itinerary for Plymouth Notch by driving directly to the final stop: the cemetery containing the graves of six generations of Coolidges, including the president. The grassy cemetery, typical of Vermont, was carved into a hillside too steep for farming. Coolidge was one of two American presidents born in Vermont (Chester Arthur was the other), yet Coolidge's gravesite modestly omits any mention of his five and a half years in the White House, noting merely his birth on July 4, 1872, and death on Jan. 5, 1933. The only clue is a small presidential seal etched into the granite headstone. Beside him lie his wife, Grace Anne Goodhue, from Burlington, Vt., and his younger son, Calvin Jr., whose premature death from blood poisoning at age 16 in 1924 plunged the president into depression.</p>
        <p>The road that Coolidge traveled from Plymouth Notch to the White House led through Massachusetts: he graduated from Amherst College and became a lawyer in Northampton, where he was elected mayor. His political career took him to the state legislature and the governor's mansion. In 1921, he moved to Washington as vice president in the new Republican administration of Warren G. Harding.</p>
        <p>From the cemetery, we drove through the village and passed Piney Hollow Brook, which was stocked with trout to assure a catch whenever President Coolidge went fishing on his summer holidays. When a stranger was spotted angling in the brook, Coolidge reportedly dispatched his Secret Service men to retrieve the catch. ''Those are my fish,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The centerpiece of Plymouth Notch is the Coolidge Homestead, a two-story clapboard house where time has been wound back to 2:47 a.m. on Aug. 3, 1923. That was when Coolidge was sworn in as president by his father, a notary public, by the glow of a kerosene lamp, after word of Harding's death arrived from San Francisco. When John Coolidge was asked later about his authority to administer the presidential oath, he said, ''I didn't know that I couldn't.''</p>
        <p>Even after Coolidge became president, his father put off installing electric lights in the homestead because his housekeeper, Aurora Pierce, distrusted electricity, fearing that it would burn the place down. A tour of the homestead offers other intriguing windows on rural life in old Vermont: a sturdy antique sleigh in the horse barn; an 1838 poster in the tool room advertising ''gargling oil'' for horses; the kitchen where the family ate (Calvin's only sibling, Abigail, died at 15, his mother when he was 12), and where Calvin and his father shaved from water heated on the wood stove.</p>
        <p>Aldrich House, around the corner, belonged to Ruth Aldrich, the daughter of the village's first cheesemaker. Hand-wrought nails and other early hardware date the original house to the 1820's. The age of old Vermont houses, we learned, tends to be imprecise, because the ''continuous'' style of New England architecture involves the adding on of barns, chicken coops and other outbuildings to avoid stepping outside in snow and rain.</p>
        <p>In the house, we found plates and menus of the tearoom operated by Miss Aldrich, which she called Top of the Notch, an allusion to the V-shaped valley leading up from Ludlow. She did the cooking with the help of two girls, serving deviled ham sandwiches for 20 cents and creamed chicken on toast for 50 cents, catering to the summer White House staff, reporters and tourists. President Coolidge ate chicken dinners for $1 in an adjacent private dining room, which was converted into a bathroom in the 1940's.</p>
        <p>Miss Aldrich also kept a diary. ''Had a great crew for breakfast,'' notes one entry posted in the dining room. ''Fed a great many. Have 15 secret service men.''</p>
        <p>When it came time to put Miss Aldrich's house in condition for visitors, a closet yielded a score of woven Abenaki Indian baskets intended for sale. Folks in Plymouth Notch seemed to save everything, down to brown paper bags and string in the kitchen drawers. The Coolidge family donated many of the president's more valuable objects on display.</p>
        <p>Before air-conditioning made Washington  bearable in the summer, the president and Congress fled the heat and humidity for cooler climes like Plymouth Notch, where Coolidge's summer White House administrative staff in 1924 consisted of two: a secretary and a stenographer, both men. Compare this with the retinues that dance attendance on a president nowadays.</p>
        <p>We paused to watch an old Pathe newsreel reporting silently on Coolidge's return to Plymouth Notch in the summer of 1924. It included footage of the president, deadpan as ever, deftly gathering hay with a pitchfork, and of four eminent visitors, Henry Ford, Harvey and Russell Firestone and Thomas Edison.</p>
        <p>Coolidge's summer office can be found in the community hall, an austere room with vaulted ceiling and plank floors on the second floor above the general store. Telegraph and telephone lines were brought in to keep the president in touch with the rest of the country. The hall also contained a piano and other musical instruments played by the Plymouth Old Time Dance Orchestra, which traveled to Washington in 1926 to serenade President Coolidge.</p>
        <p>The general store has a wooden counter built by Calvin Coolidge and his father in 1890 from bird's-eye maple and cherry. The store's top shelves display goods available in 1923. Lower shelves offer handcrafts made in Vermont for sale today. We saw painted birdhouses, wooden toys and a child's red sled, but my favorite, for $16.50, was a bell sewn on leather to wear during hikes to shoo away bears. The store's filigreed antique cash register no longer rings up sales because it can't compute Vermont's 5 percent sales tax.</p>
        <p>The Plymouth Cheese Factory down the street still produces granular curd cheese made from an old recipe. The factory, which Coolidge's father helped start in 1890, was purchased last year by the state of Vermont and will reopen to tourists this month following interior repairs. Across the street, the steepled Union Christian Church, first built in 1840, is open to the public for services on the first Sunday morning of each month. It has also become popular for weddings.</p>
        <p>There is more to see. The Wilder Barn, thought to date back to about 1875, holds a marvelous collection of horse-drawn wagons and old farming implements. Wilder House, once a 19th-century tavern where Calvin Coolidge's grandmother lived as a child, has a summer cafe offering light breakfasts and lunches.</p>
        <p>In 1926, Plymouth had 29 residents. The  population has grown to about 450 today, including the adjacent communities of Plymouth Union and Tyson. Plymouth Notch draws about 40,000 tourists a year.  Many come to view the flaming foliage of the Vermont autumn; the village is seldom crowded in early summer. Still, back in the 1920's, when President Coolidge's home village seized the public's curiosity, an estimated 10,000 visitors showed up one summer day to see him, judging by a rough count of 4,000 to 5,000 parked cars.</p>
        <p>We left Plymouth Notch feeling that Coolidge deserves more credit than history accords. When Coolidge occupied the White House, more than 90 percent of Americans paid no federal taxes, yet he trimmed the national debt by a third. Although renowned for keeping his mouth shut, Coolidge held regular news conferences and he delivered more speeches than any of his 29 presidential precedessors.</p>
        <p>And when his elected term ended, Coolidge returned quietly to private life, having declared, ''I do not choose to run for president in 1928.'' The homespun philosopher Will Rogers caught the spirit of Plymouth Notch when he told Coolidge, ''You put horse sense into statemanship.''</p>
        <p>Turning back the clock</p>
        <p>It is best to begin a visit to Plymouth Notch at the visitors center, the town's only new structure, built in 1972 in the form of an early Vermont stone house. Admission to its exhibits and other buildings around the village costs $6. Children under 14 get in free. For information, contact President Calvin Coolidge State Historic Site, Post Office Box 247, Plymouth, Vt. 05056; (802) 672-3773; www.historicvermont.org.</p>
        <p>From May 27 to Oct. 15, the Coolidge historic site opens 10 buildings to the public every day, generally from 9:30 A.M. to 5 P.M. Coolidge's birthday is celebrated on July 4, with a procession to the cemetery. On July 15 and 16, there will be a show of antique gas and steam engines. Plymouth Old Home Day on Aug. 5 will feature a chicken barbecue and bake sale and, in the evening, fireworks and a concert by the Vermont Symphony Orchestra. The village's cheese and harvest festival comes on Sept. 9.</p>
        <p>A summerlong exhibit of artifacts and graphics will look at other summer retreats used by President Coolidge, including places in Swampscott, Mass., and Rapid City, S.D. Fishing equipment used by Coolidge and some fine examples of American Indian beadwork will be among the items.</p>
        <p>There is an on-site restaurant, serving lunch, and the adjacent Wilder House, offers a light breakfast and lunch from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., featuring homemade muffins and country fare like chicken pot pie. Lunch for two costs about $14. Information: Echo Lake Inn, (800) 356-6844.</p>
