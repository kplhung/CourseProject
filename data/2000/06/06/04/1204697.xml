        <p>Fearing that drug use, racy magazines and other ills might descend on their neighborhood, more than 150 people, mostly Orthodox Jews, packed a meeting of Community Board 15 on Tuesday to protest plans to open a 7-Eleven store next to their synagogue.</p>
        <p>Members of the B'nai Yosef congregation at Avenue P and East Fifth Street, some of them trembling with rage, asked the board to oppose a variance that would allow the 24-hour convenience store on the site.</p>
        <p>''Mr. 7-Eleven, if you're listening now, you are not going to be allowed to destroy our synagogue with a convenience store,'' said Councilman Noach Dear, who sometimes prays at the synagogue. B'nai Yosef attracts up to 1,000 worshippers a day.</p>
        <p>The site, which is zoned for a mix of residential and commercial uses, has been occupied for nearly 40 years by an auto repair shop. A variance allowing the repair shop to use the entire site lapsed several years ago. The new variance would grant 7-Eleven the same rights.</p>
        <p>One concern was the store's schedule, given that Orthodox Jews do not shop on Saturdays. ''Every store on that street, Jewish or not, closes on Saturday,'' one audience member called out to Kevin Jennings, a 7-Eleven representative who attended the meeting. ''Are you willing to close?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jennings said the store would remain open on Saturdays.</p>
        <p>Another issue was the store's bright lights, a ''beacon in the night,'' as Mr. Jennings put it. He said the store would be a place where children could call their parents or the police in case of problems. Neighbors countered that their neighborhood was already safe, and said the lights would attract unruly young people eager to buy alcohol.</p>
        <p>Residents also expressed concerns about other items the store might sell.</p>
        <p>''I'll be able to buy Playboy for the first time in my life,'' said Jack Hanon, an engineer who lives nearby. ''I'll be able to buy condoms for the first time in my life, in every variety. I'll be able to buy all kinds of liquor.''</p>
        <p>A store spokeswoman said the 7-Eleven did not plan to sell magazines like Playboy.</p>
        <p>In a nonbinding action, the board voted against the variance. The 7-Eleven has filed an application with the city's Board of Standards and Appeals, which is due to take up the matter in the summer.</p>
