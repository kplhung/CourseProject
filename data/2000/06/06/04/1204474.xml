        <p>WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass., in the Purple Valley of the northwestern Berkshires, does all of the stereotypical things that New England towns are supposed to do: it charms, calms and beguiles. Most of all, it nestles. The dramatic peaks of the mountain ranges that surround Williamstown are echoed by the undulating topography of the town itself, and of the Williams College campus at its center. In 1849, Henry David Thoreau famously described the organic relationship of this community to its environment: ''Some will remember, no doubt, not only that they went to the college, but that they went to the mountain. Every visit to its summit would, as it were, generalize the particular information gained below, and subject it to more catholic tests.''</p>
        <p>Environments that seem so authentically themselves often become popular getaways for rich and famous people, who need all the reality they can get.</p>

        <p>WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass., in the Purple Valley of the northwestern Berkshires, does all of the stereotypical things that New England towns are supposed to do: it charms, calms and beguiles. Most of all, it nestles. The dramatic peaks of the mountain ranges that surround Williamstown are echoed by the undulating topography of the town itself, and of the Williams College campus at its center. In 1849, Henry David Thoreau famously described the organic relationship of this community to its environment: ''Some will remember, no doubt, not only that they went to the college, but that they went to the mountain. Every visit to its summit would, as it were, generalize the particular information gained below, and subject it to more catholic tests.''</p>
        <p>Environments that seem so authentically themselves often become popular getaways for rich and famous people, who need all the reality they can get.</p>
        <p>This started happening to Williamstown in the 1930's, when Cole Porter, Sinclair Lewis and Alta Prentice Rockefeller (a daughter of John D. Rockefeller), among others, built summer places here. Since 1955, when the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute opened and the first major summer theater productions began, artists and celebrities have flocked each summer to the Purple Valley (so called because the surrounding mountains appear deep purple at dusk).</p>
        <p>The Williamstown Theater Festival's short production runs allow busy film and television actors to make rare appearances on the boards. Discriminating audiences, too, find their treks to Williamstown amply rewarded; many of the festival's first-class productions move to Broadway.</p>
        <p>The festival's largest productions run on the Main Stage, a 520-seat proscenium theater; smaller shows are presented on the Nikos Stage, a 96-seat theater. (The festival also sponsors free theater, cabaret productions and a variety of special events, new play readings and workshop projects in various spaces around town.)</p>
        <p>The festival's biggest crowd-pleaser this summer is likely to be ''Tonight at 8:30,'' a collection of six one-acts by Noel Coward, starring Blythe Danner (a 20-year veteran of the festival), Stephen Collins, Charlotte D'Amboise and Bill Irwin. In addition, Sara Gilbert (of TV's ''Roseanne'') will star in  Lanford Wilson's ''Hot l Baltimore,'' and Eric Stoltz will appear in ''Light Up the Sky.'' The festival will also feature a new version of ''Hedda Gabler'' by Jon Robin Baitz and an imagined encounter between Orson Welles and Laurence Olivier called ''Orson's Shadow'' by Austin Pendleton.</p>
        <p>North Adams, Williamstown's close neighbor to the east made a grand entrance to the art world last May when the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art (MASS MoCA) opened in a complex of 27 former factory buildings with more than 250,000 square feet of galleries, theaters, artist's studios and commercial tenant spaces. MASS MoCA's principal exhibit this year, ''Unnatural Science,'' will include major installations by Kiki Smith, among others; performances are staged every weekend, including ''Cybernations'' by J. C. Herz and others, a daylong exploration into the world of computer gaming on June 24.</p>
        <p>During the festival, stars saunter down Williamstown's Main Street, but they don't upstage their surroundings. The community has a self-assured style that is immune to the vagaries of fashion.</p>
        <p>I went to Williamstown last August, in the final days of the festival, for a weekend of equal parts nature and culture. I checked into Blackinton Manor, an imposing Federal-style bed-and-breakfast with wrought iron balconies, shaded by towering birch trees. My room, called the Music Room, had windows that stretched 12 feet from floor to ceiling, a baby grand piano, an antique wardrobe that looked like a portal to Narnia, and a Jacuzzi for two in an immaculate, light-drenched bathroom. The musical theme was reiterated by the friendly owners, Dan Epstein, a professor of chamber music at Bennington College and the Manhattan School of Music, and his wife, Betsey Peters-Epstein, a cantor, who offer occasional recitals in the large parlor.</p>
        <p>I set out for an afternoon of museum going, beginning with the Clark Art Institute on South Street. It is lined with a number of stately old stone and clapboard homes, several of which were fraternity houses before Williams went coed in 1970, and any one of which could pass for Bruce Wayne's mansion.</p>
        <p>Sterling and Francine Clark (he an heir to the Singer sewing machine fortune, she an actress at the Comedie Francaise in Paris) built the Clark Art Institute to display their collection. They situated the museum in Williamstown largely because scientists believed, in 1950, that the western Berkshires would escape nuclear fallout if New York, Boston or Washington were attacked. The Clark's permanent collection includes major works by Homer, Cassatt and Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema; its greatest treasures are the 30-plus Renoirs, the second largest concentration of Renoir's work in North America. The more imposing of the Clark's two buildings is a neo-Classical white marble structure whose intimate galleries with domestic touches (a faux fireplace, a grandfather clock) belie its external pretensions. The Clark's major exhibit this summer (June 11 to Sept. 4) will be ''Noble Dreams, Wicked Pleasures: Orientalism in America 1870-1930,'' featuring paintings by John Singer Sargent, Frederick Edwin Church and William Merritt Chase and decorative works by Louis Comfort Tiffany.</p>
        <p>After the Clark, I was ready for a short hike on the Pasture Loop Trail up Stone Hill just behind the museum. This and dozens of other local trails, including Mount Greylock on the Appalachian Trail and at 3,491  feet the state's tallest peak, are well described by the North Berkshire Outdoor Guide, written and recently updated by the Williams Outing Club.  The trail begins at the worn 1860's gravestones of two dogs that belonged to a former owner of the property, Dr. Vanderpool Adriance.  Beyond a small footbridge, I made my way through a forest of maple, beech and birch, ending in a meadow full of cows that had a sweeping view of Williamstown and the surrounding mountains. The Pasture Loop is a very easy hike: it takes less than half an hour (0.7 miles) and the grade is not steep.</p>
        <p>A shortcut brought me back to the middle of town, along the perimeter of the pristine Taconic Golf Course,  over the quiet College football field and onto Spring Street, which is lined with boutiques and shops.</p>
        <p>A toy store, called Where'd You Get That, offered the best window shopping; among the unusual items were a lifelike opossum hand puppet and a kite shaped like a bald eagle.  Across the street, The Williams Shop sells all sorts of ephemera emblazoned with the college mascot, a sarcastic-looking purple cow. Suchele Bakers, too, is worth a stop. The Parmesan focaccia was still warm, as was the gray granite ledge outside the bakery, where I sat and ate next to a young actress whose well-groomed golden retriever politely begged for a bite.</p>
        <p>MASS MoCA in North Adams was the next stop. Its gallery spaces are huge, as are some of the works on display (an installation by Robert Rauschenberg occupied a wall almost the length of a football field).  Children seem to like it. Some of the  spaces are so big that kids can run sprints in them without causing much disruption.</p>
        <p>Mezze, a casually mod little restaurant on Water Street overlooking a bend of the Green River, was my choice for dinner. By 10:45, as I was finishing a satisfying New York sirloin, a good-sized crowd was forming at the bar. A popular hangout for employees of Internet companies, such as the portal service Tripod .com, that are based in the western Berkshires, Mezze is also the closest thing in Williamstown to a gay bar, though most of the crowd is straight.  At midnight, a disco ball descended from the ceiling, and the crowd made much of the modestly sized dance floor in the middle of the room.</p>
        <p>The next morning I woke early for a hike up Pine Cobble (elevation 1,893 feet), named for the stands of pine trees that cover the mountain, and the ''cobble'' of 550-million-year-old quartzite bedrock outcroppings that are the trail's final destination.</p>
        <p>Hiking Pine Cobble is a good workout (1.6 miles up, or about two hours round trip at a moderate pace), and it's easy enough that hikers in very good shape can jog or run most of the way. My favorite point on the trail is a strangely beautiful triplet oak tree, which took form when three shoots sprouted from the stump of a large oak. Over the years, the shoots grew into large trees, and the stump rotted away, creating a small basin that collects rain water.</p>
        <p>After the triplet oak, the trail gets quite steep until it branches in several directions at the top toward various clusters of rocky outcrops. I found a private spot on which to rest,  then poked around the various tendrils of the trail with views of the Greylock Range to the south, the Taconic Range to the west, and the Dome mountain peak to the north.  Williamstown seems tiny from here.  Its miniature houses and churches look as if they've been pitched onto the rumpled blankets of a morning bed.</p>
        <p>I found my way back to Spring Street for takeout from Pappa Charlie's Deli, where the menu features  sandwiches named for their famous creators. The Joanne Woodward, for instance, consists of peanut butter, jam, bananas and raisins on whole wheat, $3.95; Bo Derek's vegetarian sandwich goes for $4.45.</p>
        <p>At Sand Springs Pool and Spa, less than two miles from town, the water bubbles up at 74 degrees year round in a setting that looks exactly like a 1950's pool club. Local tradition holds that Native Americans first discovered and used the spring. By 1827, Sand Springs had been commandeered for commercial use by entrepreneurs enamored of its reputed power to heal poison ivy and other ailments.</p>
        <p>Since 1950, the Frederick George family have owned and operated the property, which includes a large pool surrounded by umbrella-covered tables and chaises, a shallow baby pool with a small fountain in the middle, and a large hot tub. There's also a snack bar, a small basketball court and a bark-shingled white gazebo on a big shady lawn, whose hide-and-seek potential was being fully exploited by a half-dozen children.</p>
        <p>That night I signed up on the waiting list for a production at the Williamstown Theater Festival. (Performances are often sold out, but in several years of theatergoing here, I have never failed to get a ticket from the waiting list.) At the Nikos Stage I saw Eileen Heckart in ''The Waverly Gallery'' by Kenneth Lonergan, the story of an elderly woman who owns a New York art gallery and gradually disappears into the fog of Alzheimer's disease. Directed by Scott Ellis, it later opened off-Broadway.</p>
        <p>After the performance I had drinks at the Side Bar, within walking distance of the theater, where the  cast, including Ms. Heckart, occupied the tables next to mine.</p>
        <p>The day had yielded many of Williamstown's distinctive summer pleasures -- from the humbling view atop Pine Cobble to the little thrill of seeing a star onstage and, later, in person -- balanced perfectly, like this town, on the line between sophistication and simplicity.</p>
        <p>In a college town, theater, art and glorious views</p>
