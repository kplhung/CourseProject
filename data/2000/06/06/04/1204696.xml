        <p>PERHAPS because I am not from New York, and even now do not live there but rather arrive each morning by train through the aqua light of Grand Central, then up the Vanderbilt stairs and into the glare and slow-moving traffic of 43rd Street, I am more apt to identify with writers who saw the city from afar.</p>
        <p>The one who described New York best, especially that sense of how easy it is to feel out of the game even before one has a chance to be in it, was Joan Didion. She wrote, ''When I first saw New York I was 20, and it was summertime, and I got off a DC-7 at the old Idlewild temporary terminal in a new dress which had seemed very smart in Sacramento, but seemed less smart already, even in the old Idlewild temporary terminal.''</p>

        <p>PERHAPS because I am not from New York, and even now do not live there but rather arrive each morning by train through the aqua light of Grand Central, then up the Vanderbilt stairs and into the glare and slow-moving traffic of 43rd Street, I am more apt to identify with writers who saw the city from afar.</p>
        <p>The one who described New York best, especially that sense of how easy it is to feel out of the game even before one has a chance to be in it, was Joan Didion. She wrote, ''When I first saw New York I was 20, and it was summertime, and I got off a DC-7 at the old Idlewild temporary terminal in a new dress which had seemed very smart in Sacramento, but seemed less smart already, even in the old Idlewild temporary terminal.''</p>
        <p>That line, from an essay called ''Goodbye to All That,'' which originally appeared in 1967 in The Saturday Evening Post, came back to me the other afternoon as I sat in my kitchen near the Hudson previewing the new episode of the HBO series ''Sex and the City,'' which begins its third season tonight. It stars the perky Sarah Jessica Parker and is based on columns Candace Bushnell wrote in the mid-1990's for The New York Observer.</p>
        <p>In fact, I watched not only the latest installment, which has Carrie (played by Ms. Parker) and her gal pals tripping off to Staten Island in their mules and tube tops to see a bunch of fire department hunks wiggle around in their underwear at a pin-up contest, but also all of the first season and most of the second. And I cooked a ham and made a strawberry pie.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bushnell isn't a great writer. She doesn't have Ms. Didion's range or Fran Lebowitz's wit, and the world she described -- often, admittedly, against deadline -- would be unrecognizable to anyone who had never spent evenings at Elaine's or in junior lofts wondering why men didn't realize just how wonderful the eligible women of New York are.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Bushnell was in the right place at the right time. She picked up early on the strange gulf that existed between men and women who were perhaps too smart or selective for their own good, but who, in any case, couldn't see themselves sleeping with someone who didn't have money or beauty, or at least some incredible ability in the sack to make it worthwhile.</p>
        <p>Of course, this picture of Manhattan singles warily advancing toward one another with no thought of building nice stable relationships -- who cares about that? -- was both sad and funny. But by the end of the 90's, with films like Neil LaBute's ''In the Company of Men'' taking an even colder view of modern romance, Ms. Bushnell's ''downtown babes'' and Gucci-clad ''modelizers'' had begun to seem almost quaint.</p>
        <p>Until someone from HBO sent me the tapes, I had paid scant attention to the television version of ''Sex and the City,''  an oversight that might be construed as derelict on my part, considering that the show has been widely praised for being up on fashion trends. But I'm wary when the mainstream media calls a show like ''Sex and the City'' influential, then cites examples of trends it started, without evidence. It's the same concern I have whenever the fashion elite get behind a single look or declare that jewelry is out: the influence rarely travels as far from the center as one might be led to believe by the fanfare.</p>
        <p>It also didn't flip my skirt when people who work for fashion companies told me they had successfully placed products, like handbags, on the show, and hoped to do more in the future.</p>
        <p>Watching an earlier episode in which the show's four principal characters struggle with their Vuitton bags as they board the Hamptons Jitney, I can see how a little logo flogging might be good for both Vuitton's business and establishing the characters' priorities. But it's hard to think that a series that purports to reflect hip New York is doing itself any good by showing stuff you can get anywhere. Even I still expect New York to be emphatic when it comes to knowing what's smart.</p>
        <p>On the whole, though, the clothes selected by Patricia Field, the show's costume coordinator, reflect what's happening in New York and in fashion, and jibe as well with the characters' personalities. In the season opener, the gimlet-eyed Samantha Jones (played by Kim Cattrall) swans into a local firehouse wearing turquoise fur and a leopard slip for some personal 911 relief from Ricky, her latest slab of honey-coated beef. Ricky's sweet, but as usual, Samantha isn't interested in what's between his ears.</p>
        <p>In a scene from next week's episode, Samantha discovers that the stock trader she's just had sex with buys his suits in the boy's department at Bloomingdale's. When the little guy counters with a stiff insult, you get the feeling that Samantha has finally met her match.</p>
        <p>The dopey art dealer Charlotte York (played by Kristin Davis) turns up in chic strapless numbers, including a tube top (big this summer), while Miranda Hobbes, the lawyer played by Cynthia Nixon, sticks with her minimalist look. Gold hoop earrings are the most conspicuous accessory, but this isn't a surprise. They've been making a comeback for a few months.</p>
        <p>Ms. Parker's wardrobe is something of a disappointment, or maybe the fuzzy coats she has on over her clingy babe attire are simply a reflection that she's still dragging her breakup with Mr. Big around like a cord of wood. She seems in a funk, and not even the hint of dirty mischief with a politician, for whom she thoughtfully dresses like Jackie Kennedy (vintage Halston, ironed hair), can lighten the load.</p>
        <p>The thing is, as I was going through all those episodes, I couldn't help feeling depressed myself. Not for Carrie. She isn't such a tough nut to crack. At the end of last season, as she and her friends were sitting around a cafe table (does anyone in New York have that much time?) commiserating over her breakup with Mr. Big, she said something that just confirmed my impression that the series gets no closer to revealing the truth about New York and its chop-breaking single girls than a bus ride through Times Square.</p>
        <p>Referring to Barbra Streisand's politically charged character Katie in the film ''The Way We Were,'' Carrie said, ''The world's made up of two types of girls -- simple girls and the Katie girls.'' Everyone around the table smiled triumphantly.</p>
        <p>Well, if Katie was going to the barricades, these girls are going to Barneys.</p>
        <p>Apart from enjoying the sex scenes, some cool clothes and moments of crisp repartee between Samantha and her big (and not so tall) dates, I can't see people, even in other cities, sustaining interest in characters and a plot line whose novelty had already begun to wear off (hey, this is New York) when Darren Star, the producer, turned it into a television series.</p>
        <p>Come to think of it, looking at those four women sitting around the table dishing their dates, isn't Mr. Star's ''Sex and the City'' just a swankier version of ''The Golden Girls''?</p>
