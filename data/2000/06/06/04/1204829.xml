        <p>Like many of his classmates at the University of Michigan, Drew Henson spent the week of spring break in Florida. But for Henson it was no week on the beach, but a week of baseball with Derek Jeter, Paul O'Neill and other Yankees at the team's spring training complex in Tampa, Fla.</p>
        <p>The following week, Henson was back on the Michigan campus in Ann Arbor throwing passes to his receivers during the start of spring football practice. Then, a week after the 15 football practices ended, on April 15, Henson took his last final exam. The next day, he flew back to join the Tampa Yankees, the parent club's Class A affiliate in the Florida State League. Two weeks later, after hitting .333 in five games for Tampa, Henson headed north to join the Yankees' Class AA affiliate, the Norwich Navigators of the Eastern League.</p>
        <p>Such has been the peripatetic academic and sporting life of Drew Henson, who will be Michigan's starting quarterback this fall -- and presumably also in 2001 -- and who, in a few years, is expected to take over at third base for the Yankees. In fact, Mark Newman, the Yankees' vice president for baseball operations, says he will not be surprised if Henson, who is 20, is in a Yankee uniform by next summer.</p>
        <p>''We are talking about an extraordinary baseball talent here,'' Newman said. ''Drew is not just your everyday good baseball prospect.''</p>
        <p>So good that the Yankees gave the 6-foot-5-inch, 225-pound Henson a $2 million signing bonus after he graduated from Brighton (Mich.) High School in 1998 while knowing that he had accepted a football scholarship to Michigan and that he planned to play four years of college football. Under his arrangement with the Yankees, this season and next, Henson will play his last baseball game on July 31 so that he can be in Ann Arbor the next day for the start of preseason football practice.</p>
        <p>The soft-spoken Henson is not about to complain about the difficulty of playing two sports whose seasons interlock. ''Physically, it's no problem,'' Henson said before Tuesday's game at Dodd Stadium in Norwich. ''But at times I could use a mental rest.''</p>
        <p>A smooth fielder with a rifle arm and good range who hits both for average and power, Henson is regarded as the Yankees' next best prospect after first baseman Nick Johnson, whom Henson is expected to join on the Class AAA Columbus Clippers next spring.</p>
        <p>Before he threw his first pass for Michigan in 1998, Henson had spent one season with the Tampa Yankees of the rookie Gulf Coast League, where he batted .318. Last year, Henson hit .280 with 13 home runs in 69 games for the Class A Tampa Yankees of the Florida State League.</p>
        <p>Going into tonight's game in Binghamton, N.Y., Henson was hitting a team-high .302, with 25 hits 3 home runs, 16 runs batted in and a .477 slugging percentage in 22 games.</p>
        <p>''The key for Drew is not to expect too much too soon,'' said Dan Radison, a career minor leaguer who is in his first year as manager at Norwich. ''He's in a learning process here, and he's got to remember that.'' Still, Radison has seen enough to be impressed. ''Drew is something special,'' Radison said. ''He has a relaxed manner, nice soft hands in the field and an easy swing that can send the ball a long way. He's the real deal -- the whole package -- and he can't miss.''</p>
        <p>He has been the whole package since high school, where he was a straight-A student, the co-valedictorian of his graduating class and a member of the National Honor Society, scoring 1,360 on the College Boards. As a senior, he was not only rated the top football prospect in the Midwest and one of the top three in the nation, but he was also named high school player of the year in baseball by Baseball America after setting a national high school record of 70 home runs over four seasons. In addition, he set a school scoring record in basketball while averaging more than 20 points a game.</p>
        <p>Henson comes by his athletic genes naturally: his father, Dan, was a college football coach and his mother, Carol, taught and coached basketball. Henson's sister, Brittany, is a star basketball and volleyball player at Brighton High. The family moved to Michigan from Utah during Henson's freshman year in high school when his father became the offensive coordinator at Eastern Michigan. The elder Henson is now the head football agent at the International Management Group.</p>
        <p>Henson is a dean's list student at Michigan, where he will be starting his junior year in September. As the backup quarterback to Tom Brady the last two seasons, Henson appeared in 18 games, completing 68 of 137 passes for 800 yards and 6 touchdowns. As the starter this season, he is expected to be one of the top quarterbacks in the Big Ten.</p>
        <p>''It's hard to appreciate what Drew has done playing football and baseball,'' said Lloyd Carr, the Michigan football coach. ''He's so talented as a football player that if he stays in the game he'll be one of the first three or four quarterbacks picked in the N.F.L. draft in 2002. If he wasn't playing baseball, he'd be even further advanced, but he's trying to climb both Mount Everest and Mount Annapurna.''</p>
        <p>Most likely, Henson will decide to climb as high as he can in the Yankees' system and perhaps play alongside a fellow Michigander, Jeter, on the left side of the infield. Mainly because of Jeter, Henson is represented by Jeter's agent, Casey Close, who is with the International Management Group.</p>
        <p>''It's hard to say what I'll do, but I won't play both professionally,'' Henson said. ''I'll base my decision on what sport I think I can play the longest without serious injury.''</p>
        <p>For now, Henson is looking ahead to returning to Michigan and plans to start throwing a football soon to some of his Navigator teammates.</p>
        <p>''We'll find a high school field, and I'll throw some,'' he said. ''I also plan to fly in two of my receivers at Michigan -- Dave Terrell and Marquise Walker -- in July and throw to them, too.''</p>
        <p>A $2 million ''bonus baby'' can afford to do such things.</p>
