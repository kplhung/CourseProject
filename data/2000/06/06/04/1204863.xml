        <p>As he answered questions after last night's game, Al Leiter had to stop several times and insist that he was happy. The Mets' left-hander had just beaten the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, 1-0, but he had done it in spite of himself. Leiter tried to acknowledge the satisfaction in winning while admitting his own failings.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to sound like I'm a perfectionist,'' Leiter said, ''but I know how I was feeling.''</p>
        <p>He was feeling like the old Al Leiter, and that wasn't a good thing -- not when today's version has been pitching so well. He has limited his walks this year, and the Mets have lost only one of his starts. In the past, Leiter would allow a lot of walks but make up for it with strikeouts, and that is what he did last night, walking five but striking out eight in six and two-thirds innings.</p>
        <p>In five of his innings, Leiter allowed a Devil Ray into scoring position. But he allowed no hits in those situations.</p>
        <p>''It's not like he doesn't leave guys on base in a normal game he pitches,'' said Devil Rays Manager Larry Rothschild, who was Leiter's pitching coach for two years with the Florida Marlins. ''He's going to come at you, and if he walks you, he's coming at the next guy.''</p>
        <p>But Leiter was coming at the Devil Rays without his best stuff. Not since last year, he said, had he pitched with such little command of his best pitches, the slider and cutter. But he survived, even thrived, and Manager Bobby Valentine said he believed no Mets pitcher had had such fine results with such a limited arsenal this season.</p>
        <p>Leiter noticed early that his slider was flat; he was having trouble throwing it from over the top. So he improvised, mixing about 25 changeups and curveballs among his 123 pitches. He usually throws no more than 13 or 14 of those pitches per game.</p>
        <p>''It's a matter of getting outs, and so many pitchers forget that,'' Leiter said. ''However you throw the ball and however it comes out of your hand, so long as you get an out. Even though you're getting scoreless innings, when you know that it's kind of out of your game plan and you're using other pitches, you feel like you're scrambling.''</p>
        <p>Four of Leiter's walks were to Greg Vaughn, the Devil Rays' leader in home runs and a dangerous right-handed hitter. Leiter said he was pitching around Vaughn, because he would rather take his chances against Fred McGriff -- another threatening hitter, but a left-hander.</p>
        <p>Leiter (6-1) struck out McGriff with two men on in the first, and he got him to fly to center with two on in the third. But McGriff singled sharply in the fifth, and when he came up in the seventh -- after a four-pitch walk to Vaughn put the go-ahead run on base -- Dennis Cook came on in relief.</p>
        <p>Cook got McGriff to ground out, and John Franco and Armando Benitez each pitched a scoreless inning to secure the shutout. Benitez earned his 15th save by striking out the side, getting Vaughn to strike out looking on a slider. Vaughn is 0 for 6 off Benitez in his career. All six outs have been strikeouts.</p>
        <p>A misplay by Vaughn led to the Mets' only run off Steve Trachsel, who gave up six hits over seven innings.</p>
        <p>After allowing a leadoff double to Matt Franco in the third -- it was Franco's first extra-base hit of the season -- Trachsel left him stranded. Trachsel did his job again in the fourth, but Vaughn didn't do his.</p>
        <p>After permitting a leadoff double to Edgardo Alfonzo, Trachsel got two ground-ball outs. Todd Zeile lofted a high pop that seemed as if it would land several rows deep in the stands along the third-base line.</p>
        <p>Then an odd thing happened. Balls that are hit foul tend to hook farther and farther foul. Not this one.</p>
        <p>''When the ball went off my bat, I actually stood there because I thought the ball was foul,'' Zeile said. ''I saw it come back in fair, which is a strange phenomenon when you pull one in that direction.''</p>
        <p>Vaughn looked into the twilight sky and could not find the ball. He scrambled on the warning track in the corner as the ball skimmed off the wall. Zeile had a double and the Mets had the only run of the game.</p>
        <p>''I didn't know where the ball was,'' Vaughn said. ''It went up -- I lost it, and it cost us the game.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>Last night's game was the Mets' 55th, marking the one-year anniversary of a dark time for the club. After 55 games last year, General Manager STEVE PHILLIPS fired three coaches, and BOBBY VALENTINE suggested he should no longer be manager if the team did not improve over the next 55. The team did improve, of course, and Valentine stayed.  The Mets are 31-24, four games better than they were a year ago. ''Things are starting to come together more for us, where they were probably at their worst at the end of our 55th game last year,'' Phillips said. ''We're starting to come together earlier than we did a year ago.'' . . . LENNY HARRIS, acquired from Arizona for BILL PULSIPHER on Friday, lined out as a pinch-hitter in the seventh inning.</p>
