        <p>Re ''A Tyranny of Standardized Tests,'' by Leon Botstein (Op-Ed, May 28):</p>
        <p>As the parent of three, I've learned that testing measures only a small portion of a child's intellectual reservoir as well as his special talents and gifts. And yet standardized testing is often used as the method of choice to pigeonhole students, guiding important choices like college placement and future employment.</p>

        <p>Re ''A Tyranny of Standardized Tests,'' by Leon Botstein (Op-Ed, May 28):</p>
        <p>As the parent of three, I've learned that testing measures only a small portion of a child's intellectual reservoir as well as his special talents and gifts. And yet standardized testing is often used as the method of choice to pigeonhole students, guiding important choices like college placement and future employment.</p>
        <p>Tests, by their nature, stress some values over others. They do not, as a rule, measure creativity, music and artistic ability, ethics, human relationships or independent thinking.</p>
        <p>Tests may have value as a tool in education, but they are a very poor, even destructive measure of a person.</p>
