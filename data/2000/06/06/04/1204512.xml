      <abstract>
        <p>Randy Cohen The Ethicist question-and-answer column on ethics of giving gift received from vendor to another worker; also responds to questions on ethics of buying tickets for person offering money to avoid standing on line and of giving false or partial replies to surveys that must be filled out to gain access to some Web sites</p>

        <p>In my job, I get many presents from vendors. Recently, I received a particularly thoughtful gift that I have no use for. Instead of having it clutter my office or throwing it away, I am considering giving it to someone else in appreciation for some work done on a recent project. Is such regifting ethical? -- Anonymous, San Francisco</p>
        <p>This seems more a matter of manners than morals, but you may pass a gift along if doing so would not wound the original giver. To put it another way, the less of the giver's sentiment attached, the freer you are to regift. If, for example, you receive unemotional cash, you needn't frame those $20 bills and hang them above the mantel to be treasured for centuries as a precious family heirloom. But an intimate token of regard ought not be shuffled off to someone else. To do so would display a kind of emotional promiscuity -- if not unethical, then certainly unfeeling.</p>

But an intimate token of regard ought not be shuffled off to someone else. To do so would display a kind of emotional promiscuity -- if not unethical, then certainly unfeeling.</p>
        <p>But unless I've misunderstood the situation, you should be more concerned with the ethics of accepting gifts from vendors with whom you do business. If this isn't actual bribery, it certainly lives in the same neighborhood.</p>
        <p>My fiance and I waited in line for four hours to buy tickets to a show. There were a limited number, so each person was allowed only two. We were approached by a man who offered us a $100 bonus to each buy an extra ticket. I was ready to accept, but my fiance said it wouldn't be fair to those who had waited in line. Was he right? What if no bonus money had been offered? -- R.A., Connecticut</p>
        <p>I'm with your fiance. The money-waving guy was trying to cut in line, showing contempt for everyone behind you. And by offering money, he showed contempt for you, implying that even if you disapproved of his request, you would set aside your values if the price was right. Furthermore, because tickets were in short supply, his jumping the line means that someone farther back might not get to go.</p>
        <p>Even if this smoothie had offered no ''bonus'' -- a delightful euphemism for ''bribe,'' by the way -- his behavior would still be objectionable because it undermines one of the small civilities of ordinary life. He affronts the sense of fairness, of equal opportunity, that distinguishes a line from a mob. But that's the kind of savage behavior people are driven to in a desperate attempt to see a final performance of ''Cats.''</p>
        <p>Many Web sites require you to register to gain access, the equivalent of being asked to produce an ID and a personal history to walk into Macy's. Sometimes I give false or partial replies on their surveys. They get some data (but not private info) for their database, and I get to cyber-window-shop in peace and anonymity. Sound fair? -- A.M., Tel Aviv</p>
        <p>It is fine to omit personal information, not fine to lie. Fortunately, there is a technical solution. While many boxes on these questionnaires must be filled in to gain access to the site, this can be done in a variety of ways. Rather than insert a fake address, for example, type in your protest: ''This question is intrusive.'' You'll gain access to the site, and the proprietor will understand your objection and have a chance to change his ways.</p>
        <p>Of course, you always have the option of not visiting a Web site that you think is making impertinent demands. Incidentally, that Macy's analogy is an imperfect one. On the Internet, no one sprays you with perfume samples; Web technology is, mercifully, in its infancy.</p>
        <p>Do you have ethical queries that you need answered? Send them to ethicist@nytimes.com or The Ethicist, The New York Times Magazine, 229 West 43rd Street, New York, N.Y. 10036, and include a daytime phone number.</p>
