        <p>Fred Baron has perhaps the best party house for fund-raisers in the whole state of Texas, a 15,000-square-foot Dallas house designed by Robert A. M. Stern. And Mr. Baron, a wealthy plaintiffs' lawyer, has plenty of rich friends to fill it.</p>
        <p>So when he agreed last year to work as a big fund-raiser for Vice President Al Gore, he had all the right tools.</p>
        <p>In a few weeks, Mr. Baron, 52, will be the new president of the powerful Association of Trial Lawyers of America, which has vowed to do everything it can to defeat Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who has long made curbing civil litigation and limiting jury awards and lawyers' fees a centerpiece of his campaign.</p>
        <p>But while Mr. Baron has given Mr. Gore a great fund-raising boost, he has also given the Republicans a ready target in their campaign to link Mr. Gore to the image of greedy trial lawyers.</p>
        <p>Several years ago, asbestos defense lawyers seized on a memorandum written by a paralegal in Mr. Baron's law firm, and charged in court papers that it had been used to coach the testimony of witnesses in asbestos cases. The document received wide publicity at the time, and conservative columnists and politicians have used it to repeatedly pound Mr. Baron. Asbestos companies have used it to castigate him in advertisements.</p>
        <p>The attacks on Mr. Baron come as the trial lawyers engage in what is probably their most critical and intensely fought presidential election. Beyond picking judges, the next president will shape federal policy on issues in which the trial lawyers have a big stake. The lawyers have taken the lead in major legal battles against big tobacco companies and, with help from the federal government, are seeking to make it easier to sue gun manufacturers and health maintenance organizations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has long cited tort reform -- laws that restrict civil litigation and limit jury awards -- as one of his greatest accomplishments as governor of Texas, and has said that if elected president he would take it to the federal level.</p>
        <p>''This election goes right to where trial lawyers live,'' said Scott Harshbarger, the president of Common Cause and a former Democratic attorney general of Massachusetts.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, lawyers like Mr. Baron are fighting back. In 1999, trial lawyers, who historically give the bulk of their contributions to Democrats, gave $4.4 million to Democratic candidates and political committees. That figure was two and a half times more than they gave in the same 12-month period during the previous presidential cycle, according to Common Cause. And many trial lawyers were among the big givers at a gala Democratic dinner on May 24 in Washington that raised $26 million.</p>
        <p>It is against this backdrop that Mr. Baron, whose firm gave $135,000 in campaign contributions to Democrats in 1999, finds himself pushing the interests of trial lawyers, while defending his own reputation as a bruising litigator.</p>
        <p>''I walk around with a bull's-eye on my head,'' said Mr. Baron, a short, trim man who wears expensive suits and wire-rim glasses.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baron has long said that the controversial memorandum was written by an overzealous paralegal, who subsequently swore in court papers that she was its author. The document, which emerged in 1997, instructed claimants never to testify that they saw a warning label on asbestos packages or knew about its dangers. Some asbestos companies sought court-ordered sanctions against Mr. Baron's firm, and a Texas judge asked a state district attorney to investigate the memorandum. The United States attorney's office in Dallas also apparently made some preliminary inquiries into the matter, according to people who said they were interviewed by federal investigators.</p>
        <p>Those inquiries, however, soon fizzled out. Also, several lower court findings by Texas state courts against Mr. Baron's firm were thrown out on appeal. Mr. Baron said he was also confident that the last legal dispute over the document, which is in an Ohio state court case, would be resolved in his favor.</p>
        <p>As a result, Mr. Baron has declared himself and his firm exonerated. Still, even as he takes over a group that is a cornerstone of Mr. Gore's support, he remains haunted by the document and its implications of witness coaching.</p>
        <p>It was cited earlier this year in newspaper advertisements paid for by the GAF Corporation, an asbestos producer, and others then pressing Congress for legislation limiting asbestos lawsuits. ''You should be aware of the FACTS concerning Baron and his modus operandi,'' proclaimed one advertisement, which described the memorandum as one of his many ''flagrant abuses'' that make a ''mockery of our legal system.''</p>
        <p>Walter Olsen, an adviser to Mr. Bush on tort reform, said he was surprised that the trial lawyers' group elected Mr. Baron president, given the document's controversy.</p>
        <p>''The idea that he is going to be representative of a whole industry after the disclosure of the memo suggests a boldness on their part or an imperviousness to public criticism,'' said Mr. Olsen, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a research group, who has written articles critical of Mr. Baron.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baron said that tort-reform advocates like Mr. Olsen and conservative opinion shapers like the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal had kept the memorandum controversy alive as a way of smearing him. To defend himself he has hired legal troubleshooters like Abbe Lowell, the chief investigative counsel for the Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee during the impeachment proceedings against President Clinton.</p>
        <p>But he has also struck back at his accusers with zeal. Some companies that filed legal challenges against Mr. Baron's firm over the legal document soon found themselves negotiating settlement deals favorable to him after he threatened to bring more asbestos claims against them. And he has intensified his pursuit of a former asbestos company executive who Mr. Baron contends spearheaded the assault against him, charging in court papers that the executive stole millions earmarked for asbestos claims.</p>
        <p>''I learned early that it's best to let the other guy take the first shot,'' Mr. Baron said. ''And then you come back at him.''</p>
        <p>It is a tactic Mr. Baron has used frequently in a career that has mirrored the transition of many trial lawyers from scrappy advocates for workers and consumers to wealthy businessmen eager to influence policies and politics.</p>
        <p>These days, Mr. Baron, who was also a major contributor to President Clinton, plays golf with the president and dines several times a year at the White House. In recent years, he has been the host of a party for the Democratic National Committee at its annual retreat in Aspen, Colo., where he and his wife, Lisa Blue, a former prosecutor who is now a partner in his firm, have a second home.</p>
        <p>A graduate of the University of Texas Law School, Mr. Baron went to work in the early 1970's for a Dallas law firm whose clients included the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Union. He was asked to look at conditions at an asbestos insulation plant in Texas and said he found them appalling.</p>
        <p>''It was disgusting,'' he said. ''People were working in there shoveling up asbestos and they weren't even wearing masks.''</p>
        <p>He soon joined forces with a small group of lawyers around the country who had uncovered documents showing that asbestos producers like the Johns Manville Corporation long knew that asbestos, a mineral fiber that is now banned, could cause fatal diseases. By the 1980's, thousands of workers exposed to asbestos had filed lawsuits and Mr. Baron's firm, Baron &amp; Budd, would eventually handle more claims than any other.</p>
        <p>Before long, he was an extremely wealthy man whose political influence and contributions were felt in elections for Texas state judges, both Democrats and Republicans said in interviews.</p>
        <p>''Fred is a very likable guy who throws a lot of parties,'' said Tom Pauken, who was chairman of the Texas Republican Party from 1994 to 1997. ''He pays close attention to who is running and who isn't, and he has an ability to influence the process.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Baron also played a critical role in a 1997 United States Supreme Court decision that still hangs over asbestos cases today. At the time, some major lawyers representing asbestos claimants, including some of Mr. Baron's longtime colleagues, struck a deal with producers under which all current and future asbestos cases would be settled as part of a huge class-action lawsuit.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Baron, who opposes the use of class-action lawsuits as a means of resolving legal disputes, led the fight against the plan. He poured $4 million into opposing it, hiring experts like Prof. Laurence H. Tribe of Harvard Law School to argue against it before the Supreme Court, which struck down the settlement as unconstitutional.</p>
        <p>Some critics asserted that Mr. Baron's motive was profit, not legal principles, saying that his once pioneering firm had evolved into an asbestos ''mill'' that raked in a large fee for every claim it handled, and that the stream of cases would have been shut off under the settlement. But even some supporters of the plan disagreed.</p>
        <p>''Opposing the case was in Baron's economic interest but he is a more complex person,'' said John Aldock, a lawyer for a consortium of asbestos companies involved in the failed plan.</p>
        <p>By the late 1990's, Mr. Baron said, he decided it was crucial for him to get involved in the trial lawyers' lobbying group as its battles with advocates of tort reform intensified. One possible inspiration: Mr. Bush signed the sweeping tort reform bill in Texas in 1997, ending a legal mechanism that Mr. Baron had helped engineer.</p>
        <p>Under it, asbestos claims from other states could be filed in Texas state courts. Ralph Wayne, the president of the Texas Civil Justice League, a tort reform group in Austin, said a 1996 study by his group found that Mr. Baron's firm had filed the majority of the roughly 56,000 out-of-state asbestos claims pending in Texas courts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wayne said that many of those cases had been filed in Texas jurisdictions with reputations for high jury awards.</p>
        <p>''He knows courts in Texas and he knows where to file the cases,'' Mr. Wayne said of Mr. Baron.</p>
        <p>It was also around that time that the memorandum controversy erupted. While a lawyer from Mr. Baron's firm turned over the document to defense lawyers in pretrial testimony in an asbestos case, the lawyer said that publicity about it was fueled by a former asbestos company executive who had been his longtime nemesis.</p>
        <p>Over the past decade, Mr. Baron and that executive, Craig Smith, a former top official of the Raymark Corporation, have waged a lengthy court battle over the assets of the bankrupt concern. In 1988, a federal judge in Oregon found that Mr. Smith had engaged in a number of complex business transactions in a bid to escape Raymark's asbestos liabilities.</p>
        <p>More recently, Mr. Baron and others said in court papers filed in United States District Court in Hartford that Mr. Smith and members of his family engaged in a scheme to illegally divert millions of dollars earmarked for asbestos claims for their own benefit.</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview, Mr. Smith, who now runs a business in Wales, denied any wrongdoing in the bankruptcy proceeding. But he acknowledged meeting with Federal Bureau of Investigation officials in 1997 to encourage the agency to look at the controversial memorandum. He also said he hired lawyers who, among other things, filed lawsuits against Mr. Baron and other asbestos lawyers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith insisted, however, that his actions were driven not by any animus toward Mr. Baron but by his belief that many of the asbestos claims filed by the Texas law firm were groundless.</p>
        <p>''I believe they are undermining the industrial strength of this country,'' Mr. Smith said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baron's interpretation of Mr. Smith's motives is quite different. ''He is absolutely a down-in-the-dirt crook,'' Mr. Baron said.</p>
        <p>Some defense lawyers involved in asbestos litigation said that while Mr. Baron and his firm might have escaped sanctions in connection with the memorandum, they remained convinced that his firm had used questionable tactics to press dubious claims.</p>
        <p>Elizabeth L. Phifer, an outside lawyer in Dallas for the Borg-Warner Corporation, which challenged Mr. Baron over the memorandum, said that asbestos claimants she had questioned in pretrial testimony over the past decade had repeatedly given the same answers to questions about events that happened decades earlier. ''It is remarkable how similar the answers sound,'' Ms. Phifer said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baron is unmoved. After Borg-Warner challenged him, he brought two asbestos cases to trial, winning large judgments. The company soon withdrew its legal challenge and now settles claims with Mr. Baron's firm for more than it previously did, the Texas lawyer said.</p>
        <p>''She is bitter,'' said Mr. Baron, referring to Ms. Phifer. ''She lost.''</p>
