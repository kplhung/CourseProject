        <p>Amanda Charlotte Rogers and Kevin Charles Mahoney, actors living in Los Angeles, were married yesterday by the Rev. Janet Broderick Kraft at Grace Episcopal Church in New York.</p>
        <p>The bride, a graduate of William and Mary College, has appeared in television soap operas, including ''The Guiding Light'' and ''All My Children''; Off Off Broadway plays; independent films; and commercials.</p>
        <p>She met Mr. Mahoney, an actor in regional and Off Off Broadway and a graduate of Georgia State University, four and a half years ago in an acting class in New York. ''We couldn't take our eyes off each other,'' she remembered. ''There was just such a spark. Even his best friend commented on it. He said, 'Wow, you guys are on fire!' ''</p>
        <p>She added: ''Two months into the class, we did a scene together, a love scene. Oh my goodness, it was so easy to do.'' Soon, they were spending their days together, eating sushi, walking through the Metropolitan Museum of Art and accompanying each other to auditions. Ms. Rogers grew up in New York, in a two-actor household. Her mother, Margaret Hall, is a television and theater actress; her father, Gil Rogers, regularly appears on both ''All My Children'' and ''The Guiding Light,'' as well as in films and Broadway shows.</p>
        <p>''It never crossed my mind that I would marry anybody but an actor,'' Ms. Rogers said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rogers's parents even encouraged her to marry an actor. Her mother said: ''Gil and I have seen actors marry what we laughingly call civilians, and we look at each other sadly and shake our heads because we don't understand how these mixed marriages work.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mahoney is a son of Jean and Francis L. Mahoney of Detroit. His father, a retired engineer and draftsman for several car companies in Detroit, also worked occasionally as an actor in regional theater.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, the couple moved to Los Angeles and decided to marry. ''There was no foreseeable end to our relationship,'' the bride said.</p>
        <p>Now, they say they avoid doing love scenes in movies together. ''The longer you're together, the harder it is to do steamy love scenes, because you don't want people to think it's for real,'' Ms. Rogers said. ''You don't want people to think they're being voyeuristic.''</p>
        <p>Before the wedding, the bride's mother said she approved of Mr. Mahoney, and not only because he's an actor. ''Kevin adores my daughter, just adores her,'' she said. ''Amanda seems to return the compliment,'' Ms. Hall said. ''As my goddaughter said to Amanda years ago, 'Darling, if they don't worship you, forget it.' ''</p>
