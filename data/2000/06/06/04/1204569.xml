        <p>AT first it might seem just delightfully precocious: 10-year-old children onstage in sneakers and oversize black T-shirts, bringing smiles to parents' faces by reciting lines from ''Romeo and Juliet.''</p>
        <p>But the performance at the the Murray Avenue School here last month was not just a school play. It was also a closely monitored pilot project involving two classes from very different backgrounds.</p>
        <p>A fourth-grade class from the Chatsworth Avenue Elementary School in Larchmont, where most students are from upper-income neighborhoods, staged the Shakespeare play with a fifth-grade class from the Mamaroneck Avenue School, where many students (white, black, Hispanic and Asian) are from lower income areas and are the children of immigrants.</p>
        <p>The elementary schools in the Mamaroneck district have some of the widest disparities in the county, from the upscale white neighborhoods of Larchmont to poorer immigrant neighborhoods. And the need to bridge this gap, especially before students are thrown together in junior high, has long been a concern, said Steven Bluestone, the teacher of the Chatsworth class.</p>
        <p>''These two groups of kids would probably never even meet, much less work together, at this age if not for this,'' said Mr. Bluestone, who conceived the project.</p>
        <p>In 1998 he applied for a grant from the Mamaroneck Schools Foundation to buy six computers and five laptops to help students make classroom presentations. Then the district superintendent, Dr. Sherry King, had computers put into Ken Taylor's fifth- grade classroom at the Mamaroneck Avenue school, so the two classes would learn technology together.</p>
        <p>For a subject, Mr. Bluestone suggested staging ''Romeo and Juliet.'' Before going to Chatsworth Avenue three years ago, Mr. Bluestone had worked in the New York City schools for 12 years and long wanted to involve students of diverse backgrounds in performing Shakespeare. The classes began discussing the play online in chat rooms and by e-mail before meeting for rehearsals in May.</p>
        <p>''I always wanted to bring students of different backgrounds together, but I never knew exactly how that would occur,'' Mr. Bluestone said. ''I hoped the technology would prepare and support, finally bringing the kids together.''</p>
        <p>A consultant from the Educational Development Center for Children and Technology in Manhattan monitored the project for the district. The Murray Avenue school was chosen as a neutral site for rehearsals and performances to make the children more comfortable, Mr. Bluestone said.</p>
        <p>''Most of my students come from upper-middle-class or wealthy neighborhoods, and Ken's students are a real mix, with a good deal of lower income and immigrant families,'' Mr. Bluestone said. ''And to have them working together and getting along, blind to any differences, that stuff just doesn't happen much here.''</p>
        <p>The average academic achievement of Chatsworth Avenue students, based on fourth-grade tests, was significantly higher last year than that of Mamaroneck Avenue students. Demographic information was unavailable, but 17.5 percent of Mamaroneck Avenue students are eligible for free lunch, compared with none at Chatsworth Avenue.</p>
        <p>For school officials hoping to use fair Verona as a sociological petri dish, here is what they saw: any gaps stemming from ethnic and economic differences were nonexistent onstage. Students quickly dropped their guard and began cooperating enthusiastically, helping one another deliver dialogue from the diaphragm, and trading high-fives afterward.</p>
        <p>Riding the bus to rehearsal, Aron Baigelman sat with two Chatsworth classmates, Nathaniel Lowenthal and William Moore, all of whom are white. They said they rarely ride their bikes out of their neighborhood, so they did not know Mr. Taylor's students.</p>
        <p>But in the auditorium, Aron rehearsed the role of the prince along with two Mamaroneck Avenue students, Marcus Rohim, 11, who is black, and John Pierre Hohl, who is Peruvian. Between scenes, they discussed television programs, the New York Knicks and even the Montague-Capulet feud.</p>
        <p>Floyd Rumohr, artistic director for the Chekhov Theater Ensemble in Brooklyn and the acting coach for the project, said that Shakespearean drama ''lets students from different backgrounds meet on new turf.''</p>
        <p>''All the children are dealing with language that's 400 years old,'' he said. ''It's almost a foreign language, so no child has all the advantages.''</p>
        <p>At the actual performance, Inocencio Arias and his wife, Beatrice, sat in an otherwise empty balcony. Mr. Arias, who works on a truck collecting recyclables in town, watched his 11-year-old daughter Daisy play the part of Benvolio.</p>
        <p>Speaking in broken English, Mr. Arias said he left school in Mexico after sixth grade. He said he was unfamiliar with Shakespeare's plays but hoped his daughter would learn them.</p>
        <p>Regardless of their income, ethnic background or fluency in English, most parents said they had enjoyed their children marching around the house reciting lines of iambic pentameter and answering questions with words like cometh and goeth.</p>
        <p>Julie Spielvogel, 9, a Chatsworth student, can recite lines from several plays.</p>
        <p>''I mean, most of Shakespeare's plays are pretty well known,'' said Julie, who along with a blond-haired classmate, William Moore, shared the role of the Nurse with two Mamaroneck Avenue students, Elena Reyes, 11, and Yajaira Gonzalez, 10.</p>
        <p>Julie's mother, Lisa Spielvogel, said her daughter never stopped reciting lines since the Shakespeare project started, even appointing her cat, Kitty-O, as a stand-in for Romeo. Julie was enrolled in a children's Shakespeare theater troupe when the family spent a year in London last year. Mrs. Spielvogel and her husband, a doctor, rented Julie a cartoon version of ''Romeo and Juliet'' and recently took her to see the New York City Ballet perform a dance version.</p>
        <p>For Jonathan Brewton, however, a student in the Mamaroneck Avenue School, Shakespeare was less accessible. At first, Jonathan, 11, resisted learning the play, Mr. Taylor said, but after a few rehearsals, he became fascinated with it and pestered his mother to find books and a videotape of it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Taylor said his students were hesitant about embracing Shakespeare, but were challenged by discussions and rehearsals with the Chatsworth students.</p>
        <p>Naomi Lowenthal's son, Nathaniel, is a Chatsworth student who played Friar Laurence. She and her husband, Daniel A. Lowenthal, a lawyer in Manhattan, said students from different elementary schools in Mamaroneck need to mingle more before junior high.</p>
        <p>''There's Little League,'' she said, ''but things like this also help neighborhoods from being too insular.''</p>
        <p>Beth MacErlen, whose son Ryan goes to Chatsworth and played Friar Laurence, agreed, calling Shakespeare a common language to bring them together.</p>
