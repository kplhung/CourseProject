        <p>THE producer T. Edward Hambleton, the human engine behind New York's storied Phoenix Theater for three decades, is an anomaly in his family. None of his own children have gone into the arts and his father's life was the Baltimore banking firm of Hambleton &amp; Company. Yet from the time Mr. Hambleton, the descendant of an old and wealthy Maryland family, graduated from Yale University in 1935, his mind was set.</p>
        <p>''I started out in chemistry,'' Mr. Hambleton, 89, said. He then indulged in one of the lengthy pauses for which he is famous. ''But after a year, I decided it was theater or nothing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hambleton was speaking by telephone from his home near Baltimore on May 10, shortly after learning that his years of devotion to the stage had earned him a special Tony award for lifetime achievement. He said he expected to collect the trophy at the ceremony at Radio City Music Hall tonight.</p>
        <p>In a business rife with dramatic excess, Mr. Hambleton's character is an anomaly, too. The producer and co-producer of more than 100 shows on and Off Broadway, he never engaged in any outlandish David Merrick-like antics, or Machiavellian tactics. Friends and colleagues routinely employ the same words to describe him: patient, serious, passionate.</p>
        <p>''T.'s inherent modesty has concealed his astonishing accomplishments in behalf of the American theater,'' said the director Harold Prince, referring to the impresario by his nickname. ''He is one of the stubbornnest fellows I have ever known and all of it in support of his superb taste and priorities. The Phoenix Theater was, in my opinion, the closest our country has come to the Royal National Theater. On a more personal note, it was T. who called me in 1961 and offered me my first gig directing.''</p>
        <p>The actor Austin Pendleton, who made his professional debut at the Phoenix in 1961 in Arthur Kopit's ''Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mamma's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feelin' So Sad,'' said: ''He's deeply gentle. He has this ability to get along with all kinds of high-strung people, which is probably why he weathered all those years.''</p>
        <p>The Phoenix endured from 1953 to 1983, and the single common denominator spanning that era was the indefatigable T. Edward. The idea for the company was hatched over a conversation at the Players Club between Mr. Hambleton and the producer-designer-author Norris Houghton, a Princetonian to Hambleton's Yalie. Both yearned to present great actors in seldom-seen classics as well as challenging new plays, and both felt frustrated by the limitations of the Broadway model. Their dream theater would lie far from Times Square and would present several plays a season in six-week runs, with a top ticket price of $3.30.</p>
        <p>The Phoenix -- the dream made real -- opened in the old Yiddish Art Theater at Second Avenue and 12th Street (now a cinema multiplex) with Sidney Howard's ''Madam, Will You Walk?,'' starring Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronyn. It was Dec. 1, 1953, the eve of a newspaper strike -- a foreshadowing of the ambitious venture's star-crossed history.</p>
        <p>''We had, as you sometimes do, a tremendously successful season in our first year,'' Mr. Hambleton recalled. Indeed, the debut was legendary. In addition to the Howard play, there was ''Coriolanus,'' starring Robert Ryan and directed by John Houseman; ''The Seagull,'' starring Montgomery Clift (in his last stage appearance); and ''The Golden Apple,'' Jerome Moross and John LaTouche's innovative musicalization of the ''Iliad'' and the ''Odyssey,'' which transferred to Broadway and won the New York Drama Critics Circle Award. Coming only a year after Circle in the Square's watershed staging of ''Summer and Smoke,'' the founding of the Phoenix helped inaugurate the fledgling Off Broadway movement.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hambleton came up with the name Phoenix, and it proved prophetic. Many times the company seemed on the brink of death, only to rise again in a nearly unrecognizable form. It became a nonprofit organization after its initial years as a commercial venture, and in 1961 it abandoned the cavernous Second Avenue space for an intimate 300-seat theater on East 74th Street (Mr. Houghton departed soon after to head the drama department at Vassar College). A few seasons later, the Phoenix joined forces with Ellis Rabb's Association of Producing Artists and moved into the Lyceum Theater on Broadway for three years. During its last years, it was located in the Marymount Manhattan Theater on East 71st Street, where it presented new works by American and European playwrights.</p>
        <p>Many critics faulted the Phoenix for its contrariness of image and mission. Anne Cattaneo, whose first job in New York was at the Phoenix in the late 1970's and who is now the dramaturge at Lincoln Center Theater, disagrees. ''That was its mission,'' she said, ''not to have a consistent identity. It's born out of the egg, it dies, and it's born again. It was allowed to change, it didn't get stodgy and behind the times.''</p>
        <p>Throughout its many incarnations, however, the Phoenix was always a haven for actors. ''The thing about T.,'' Ms. Cattaneo said, ''is he had a great insight and love of artists. He brought them together and left them alone. He wasn't a meddling producer.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hambleton elaborated: ''We tried to be a little wide open in our casting. After all, Robert Ryan had never done Shakespeare, let alone 'Coriolanus.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hambleton's respect for talent led to many memorable productions and performances. Uta Hagen was given the opportunity to play one of her favorite roles, Natalia Petrovna in Turgenev's ''Month in the Country.'' Tyrone Guthrie directed Eva Le Gallienne and Irene Worth in Schiller's ''Mary Stuart.'' Marcel Marceau made his American debut at the Phoenix, as did Joan Plowright in ''The Chairs'' by Ionesco.</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Pendleton and Barbara Harris were discovered in ''Oh Dad, Poor Dad,'' which also marked Jerome Robbins's nonmusical directorial debut. And during the company's final season, unknown actors like Meryl Streep, Glenn Close and Mary Beth Hurt played roles in the early works of Wendy Wasserstein (''Uncommon Women and Others''), Christopher Durang (''Beyond Therapy'') and Marsha Norman (''Getting Out'').</p>
        <p>Mr. Hambleton didn't lend a hand only to young playwrights. Ms. Cattaneo remembered translating a play by the German dramatist Botho Strauss for the Phoenix's 1978-79 season. Traveling to Berlin to do research, she was encouraged to visit the Bertolt Brecht family. Incredulous, she paid a call and discovered from his relatives that Brecht had revered Mr. Hambleton.</p>
        <p>THE Epic Realist had good reason to. In 1947, Mr. Hambleton had produced the American premiere of Brecht's ''Galileo,'' with the author directing -- first in Los Angeles and then on Broadway. During the New York run, Brecht -- living in exile in the United States at the time -- was called before the House Un-American Activities Committee. Mr. Hambleton gallantly escorted the playwright down to the hearing. Immediately following his appearance, Brecht boarded a plane and flew to Switzerland, never to return.</p>
        <p>Throughout his career, the producer's passion for the theater never dimmed. In Mr. Houghton's 1991 autobiography, ''Entrances and Exits,'' he marveled about his partner, ''His was a more consistent and dogged optimism than any I'd ever known.'' In his book ''Broadway,'' Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times called Mr. Hambleton ''the most indomitable gentleman in New York.''</p>
        <p>T., himself, has few regrets. ''We may not have been completely successful,'' he said, ''but we opened the boundaries beyond what was being done and it showed a lot of people that these things could be done. And that's the thing I'm most proud of.</p>
        <p>''Of course,'' he added, ''nobody has been able to match the success the Greeks had in the old days or the Elizabethan theater had, but. . . .'' He paused. ''I think that most of the things we did were good for the theater. I'm glad that we did them.''</p>
