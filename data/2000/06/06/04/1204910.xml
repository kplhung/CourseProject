        <p>Not long ago, Christopher Lowell, the host of a home design show on the Discovery Channel, was eating peacefully in a restaurant in the South Beach area of Miami, when a burly, bearded Hell's Angel-type gentleman approached. ''Are you Christopher Lowell?'' the biker asked. ''Stand up!''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lowell hesitantly complied, and was greeted with a sternum-crushing bear hug, along with a hearty ''Thank you.''</p>
        <p>The last time Susie Coelho, the host of ''Surprise Gardener,'' was in Las Vegas, the bellman hailing her cab stopped dead in his tracks. Instead of getting her the taxi, he rushed inside to grab a co-worker and returned, pointing at Ms. Coelho and gushing: ''Remember that flagstone walkway in my yard? She was the one. She showed me how to do it.''</p>
        <p>When Shari Hiller and Matt Fox made a personal appearance in Milwaukee several months ago, they stood by the stage waiting to be introduced. Word passed through the 900-plus crowd that they were there and faster than you could say Backstreet Boys, the hosts of ''Room by Room'' were cowering in the corner as people pushed forward to catch a glimpse of them.</p>
        <p>O.K., so it's doubtful that People magazine will soon be romantically linking any of these people with a cast member of ''Friends.'' Their shows may never make the Nielsen top 10. But they are part of a new breed of television star: the home improvement guru. Once there were only two household names, Martha Stewart and Bob Vila; now there are enough to fill a mansion.</p>
        <p>''It's amazing. We have people who show audiences how to paint a room or grow plants,'' explains Burton Jablin, senior vice president and general manager of Home and Garden Television, a cable channel in Knoxville, Tenn., devoted to home improvement shows. ''And when they go out to meet the public, they get mobbed like rock stars.''</p>
        <p>HGTV, along with the Discovery Channel, has seen the benefits that come with being purveyors of these kinds of series. Discovery, which telecasts its home improvement shows during the day, has an audience of 7.8 million people for that time period. HGTV, which went on the air in 6 million homes six years ago, is now available in 65 million homes nationwide. Its prime-time viewership has increased 17 percent over last year. (HGTV is currently available on Time Warner in New York City, on channel 64, from 7 to 11 a.m., but it can be seen 24 hours a day in Staten Island, Westchester, Long Island, Connecticut and New Jersey.)</p>
        <p>Each network's shows offer a slightly different take on the genre. ''The Christopher Lowell Show'' on the Discovery Channel provides inexpensive, innovative interior design tips. On HGTV Ms. Hiller and Mr. Fox exchange glib banter as they take viewers through redesign projects. Ms. Coelho, also on HGTV, shows up at a viewer's house each week to do a yard makeover. Lynette Jennings, host of the Discovery Channel's ''Lynette Jennings Design,'' takes her show to cities around the country to check out varying design approaches.</p>
        <p>What these and other rising stars on the rake-and-power-drill circuit have in common, though, is an ability to connect with viewers in a way that other television stars don't. Television programming, by its very nature, tends to be passive. You sit. You watch. You move on to the next show. With shows like these, though, viewers take part in the action.</p>
        <p>Beverly DeJulio, who has amassed a large following through her two series, ''Homewise,'' now in reruns on HGTV (Sundays at 1 p.m.), and ''Handy-ma'am'' on PBS, says: ''Women will approach me all the time and say things like 'I want to tell you my story. I'm a single mother of four and there was a time when my self-esteem was at its lowest point. Then you taught me how to do one project, and that helped me get my confidence back.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lowell, who was recently awarded the daytime Emmy Award for outstanding service show host, has heard that psychiatrists tape his show and play it for patients ''because they say if offers them comfort.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Jennings can't forget the letter from a farmer who lost his leg in an accident and feared that his life was over because he could no longer work. He apparently lapsed into depression but, after a few years of watching her show, he rebuilt his own home. Then he started work on his daughter's house. ''We built up his confidence,'' says Ms. Jennings. ''It's empowerment. That's what the shows are about.''</p>
        <p>It's not unusual for some home improvement hosts to receive a thousand or more letters and e-mail messages a month, and much of the communication seems evenly divided between men and women, young and old, rich and poor. This demographic-defying devotion astounds even those who run the networks.</p>
        <p>''We never predicted something like this would happen,'' says Mr. Jablin of HGTV. ''All we wanted to do was follow our game plan of information, ideas and inspiration, and hope people would respond.''</p>
        <p>He and the Discovery Channel's senior vice president and general manager of daytime programming, Chuck Gingold, agree that their channels' good fortunes are directly linked to Americans' new obsession with improving their lives by improving their homes.</p>
        <p>''I remember when Faith Popcorn wrote years ago about cocooning, and that's what's happening now,'' Mr. Gingold says. ''People want to stay home and feather their nests, so to speak.''</p>
        <p>The point is well taken. It now seems that there is a Home Depot or some other mammoth version of an old hardware store in every suburb in America. Buying a staple gun or a rototiller is as easy as buying a quart of milk. This may explain why home improvement topics have become so popular, but Mr. Fox has his own theory about why the individual hosts have developed such a following.</p>
        <p>''We're good news TV,'' he says. ''Watch any of these shows and there's never any bad news. You watch for the entertainment value, and maybe you end up learning a little too.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Coelho adds: ''We're like the neighbor next door. I want to bring a real-life sensibility to what I do. I do the same kind of work around my house as I do on the show. I'm sensitive to a budget. That's why I love it when people come up to me and start asking questions.''</p>
        <p>According to Mr. Lowell, this is a distinct departure from the approach taken by the godmother of all lifestyle shows. ''Unfortunately, I think because Martha Stewart showed how people lived in the Hamptons, a lot of women walked away from that show thinking, 'I can't do that,' '' he says. ''I want a friendly, nonjudgmental environment. When we have designers on, I tell them to drop the attitude and be real.''</p>
        <p>The approach has certainly worked for Mr. Lowell and his peers. Many of them have published books. Ms. Coelho works part time as a lifestyle commentator on the ''Today'' show. Ms. Jennings is a spokesman for Home Depot stores and is working on her own line of home improvement products. Ms. DeJulio writes a column for Good Housekeeping magazine.</p>
        <p>Their fame is apparently like a home remodeling job. Once started, it seems unlikely it will be over any time soon. In fact, how-to hosts have become such celebrities they now have celebrities as fans.</p>
        <p>''On the weekends, we have these shows on from the moment we get up until 8 or 9 at night,'' says Dennis Franz, the Emmy-winning star of ABC's police drama ''N.Y.P.D. Blue.'' ''I love Lynette Jennings, 'Room by Room.' I'm tired of soaps and stupid talk shows, and with these programs you get to see something new and different every time. I like watching people who are creative on any level, and these shows are pure entertainment for me.''</p>
