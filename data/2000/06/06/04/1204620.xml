        <p>Institute for Rational Urban Mobility president George Haikalis letter disputes May 14 article attributing decline and renewal of Chicago's State Street to closing and opening of roadway to car traffic</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>While we can cheer about ''Putting 'That Great Street' Back Into State Street'' ( May 14), blaming the street's decline, or attributing its renewal, to the closing and opening of its roadway to car traffic is a bit of a stretch. Drive-by shopping is simply not possible in a dense business district like the Loop in Chicago, the nation's second largest.</p>
        <p>State Street's two remaining department stores -- Marshall Field's and Carson Pirie Scott -- never lost motor vehicular access during the days of the State Street Mall. Adjacent streets were always kept open. These two department stores may have survived the demise of mass retailing experienced in most downtowns nationwide precisely because the city took action to improve State Street's walking environment.</p>

These two department stores may have survived the demise of mass retailing experienced in most downtowns nationwide precisely because the city took action to improve State Street's walking environment.</p>
        <p>Restoring motor vehicular traffic on State Street will not transform the street into a prosperous suburban strip mall. Needed is a comprehensive downtown plan that emphasizes pedestrian amenity and encourages people of all ethnic groups to walk, not drive, in the central city.</p>
        <p>Such a plan might well include surface light rail transit links to nearby residential areas and to the commuter rail stations. A modern light rail system serving the rich and poor alike in a restored State Street pedestrian mall could become the focus of a dramatic rebirth of downtown Chicago.</p>
