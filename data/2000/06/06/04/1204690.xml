        <p>MY very brief plunge into the electronic literary market consists of tasting Michael Crichton's ''Timeline,'' by courtesy of a hand-held computer. Even had I been reading Bacon or Shakespeare, the experience would have been dismal. Since I am not one of Mr. Crichton's ocean of fans, the event has been profoundly depressing. This scarcely would matter, except that electronic books (to call them that) may become as prevalent as surfing the Web. Some publishing experts are predicting a mass market for e-books in two to three years.</p>

        <p>''Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested.''</p>

        <p>MY very brief plunge into the electronic literary market consists of tasting Michael Crichton's ''Timeline,'' by courtesy of a hand-held computer. Even had I been reading Bacon or Shakespeare, the experience would have been dismal. Since I am not one of Mr. Crichton's ocean of fans, the event has been profoundly depressing. This scarcely would matter, except that electronic books (to call them that) may become as prevalent as surfing the Web. Some publishing experts are predicting a mass market for e-books in two to three years.</p>
        <p>For me the Internet, as I have remarked elsewhere, is like the Congo. I know it exists, but I will never go there.</p>
        <p>Never having learned to type, I am writing this lament with a Pentel Rolling Writer black ballpoint pen upon a yellow legal pad, employing the clipboard I inherited from a Cornell roommate in 1947. This is mentioned to acknowledge that I am a dinosaur, Bloom Brontosaurus Bardolator, perhaps better suited to be a creature in a Crichton thriller than a reader of one, whether on a screen or in hard copy.</p>
        <p>Publishers who are rushing toward the electronic marketplace say they are anxious about losing their readership age 45 or younger. These readers, they believe, will peruse screens, but will not willingly turn the pages of a book. Perhaps these publishers will prove to be right, and we will begin to divide into two audiences. When those in later middle life and in old age gradually yield to mortality, in a quarter of a century or so, all newly printed books will be limited editions, and e-books will have replaced the bound volume, as surely as books once replaced scrolls.</p>
        <p>A foretaste of this possible future was available last week when Microsoft offered free downloads of ''Timeline'' to anyone with a Pocket PC, a palm-size device about the size and heft of a mass-market paperback. I acquired a loaner machine from Hewlett-Packard, which came equipped with Microsoft's Reader software, which is needed to scroll through a text that runs, in the old-fangled version published by Knopf, 450 pages.</p>
        <p>Over the Memorial Day weekend I settled into the reclining chair in my living room where I usually read. Being a Falstaffian fellow, I rested the computer where I normally rest books: on my belly. Though the Pocket PC type is clear and legible, each screen holds less than the equivalent of a page -- sometimes there are only five or six words to a line -- and you must keep pages scrolling by pressing a button. Ordinarily when we're sunk in a book we're scarcely conscious of turning the pages, but with Mr. Crichton, suffice it to say, I was all too aware of the button.</p>
        <p>The plot, borrowed from ''A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,'' is about a billionaire clearly modeled on Bill Gates, who hires a band of adventurers to visit medieval France in a time machine. Mr. Crichton's prose is as dead as the 14th century, and if you're reading it on a hand-held computer, it is a double ordeal, physical and stylistic.</p>
        <p>Watching a screen is not reading, or rather is not how to read, if ''reading'' means something more or other than accompanying Mr. Crichton into the theme park of his version of historic France. I am aware that the screens of personal computers and of e-book readers, not to mention larger screens to come, are not or will not be as irritating as that of a Pocket PC, but size is hardly the crucial factor here. Reading an authentic book is very different from watching a movie, television program or computer screen. ''Authentic'' is necessarily the key word in that assertion, and needs a little elucidation.</p>
        <p>Reading a short story by Chekhov, a poem by Hart Crane, a novel by Jane Austen or a play by Shakespeare is an activity only minimally visual. The tyranny of the bodily eye is usurped by the inner ear, which is a metaphor for the mind exercising all its powers. I am not a Luddite, and am aware that there may prove to be -- even in my own remaining lifetime -- no clear limits to artificial intelligence.</p>
        <p>Computers may yet read, write, think, speak in ways transcending their programming. The epics and romances of artificial intelligence may inundate us and be no better or worse than the breaking wave of publish-your-own-manuscript e-books. But a screen remains a screen, and a printed book is something other than a container, if its content is Jane Austen or Shakespeare. Mr. Crichton does not contain the reader. Shakespeare paradoxically does. If what we read is ''Pride and Prejudice'' or ''Hamlet,'' we need to hold it rather more individually than a screen, by its very nature, can permit.</p>
        <p>I am not, in this, stressing the book as an aesthetic object, but rather as simply an isolated entity, a reminder that ''Pride and Prejudice'' or ''Hamlet'' is an achieved otherness, an idiosyncratic adventure of the spirit. Information doubtless is as well or better transmitted upon a screen as in a book, but wisdom and beauty cry out for a more individual representation. No one will say that a computer screen is the precious lifeblood of a master spirit, or that if you sliced into a screen -- as Montaigne said of a book's pages -- it would bleed. Milton and Montaigne became identical with the books they had composed. Will Mr. Crichton or Stephen King become identical with a screen?</p>
        <p>I  HAVE declared my own condition as a fossil, and I am a little haunted by the fear that books could yet also become fossils, if all the world's publishers were to go completely mad. (Last week the chairman of one house said e-books would ''nudge Mr. Gutenberg off center stage.'' The journalists at his news conference reported that he spoke in jest -- though maybe not.)  And yet, solitary readers continue to be born and to develop, since the quest for wisdom, and for aesthetic dignity and difficult pleasure, will continue. Solitary readers who love Austen and Shakespeare will want and need to reach out and hold books in their hands, even at moments when the books are not immediately to be opened for rereading.</p>
        <p>There are books on my shelves that I've held, and read, almost to pieces. One gets fond of the dog-eared quality, even the crooked bindings. There is comfort in them.</p>
        <p>Intimacy with a book is an experience not easy to describe, even when the writer attempting the description is William Hazlitt or Virginia Woolf. Intimacy with a screen is, I suppose, possible, but if there are descriptions of it available, I would rather not see them.</p>
        <p>There is an aura to books that is irreplaceable. The best analogue would be the aura of dead or lost friends and lovers, never quite replaceable.</p>
