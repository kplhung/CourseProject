        <p>Nobody has ever called Ralph Nader ''Mr. Bubbles.''</p>
        <p>Now and again he might come forth with a play on words, as in the title of his book on the auto industry, ''Unsafe at Any Speed.'' But with him, the issue is the thing, and so he is mostly seriously serious.</p>
        <p>At the moment he is seriously serious about running for president -- so serious that he is pulling close to 5 percent of the vote in many national polls, much of it at the expense of Vice President Al Gore. There is serious talk that he could cost the Democrats the White House.</p>
        <p>To get to that 5 percent level, Mr. Nader has been working the college circuit hard, using his anti-establishment pitch to appeal to the just-old-enough-to-vote crowd. And that crowd, all baggy pants and tattoos and go-Ralph laughter, seems to be having a relaxing effect on the buttoned-down 66-year-old consumer crusader.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nader tells them heavy things, for example, ''What this campaign is really about is breaking the grip of the two-party duopoly on American politics.'' Then he might segue into a light riff about how he was asked to go on a Superman television special to warn about ''the dangers of kryptonite.'' After that, he lets drop that, well, he may look square but he's hip, with a list of supporters and fund-raisers that includes the likes of Jackson Browne, Phil Donahue, the Indigo Girls, Pearl Jam, Willie Nelson, Paul Newman, Bonnie Raitt, Linda Ronstadt and Susan Sarandon.</p>
        <p>Then there was the teenager, leather-clad, body-pierced, hair dyed Dayglo pink, who crowded close to him at a recent rally on the Boston Common.</p>
        <p>''I hope,'' Mr. Nader said, ''the dye was at least organic.''</p>
