        <p>Intensity turned into raw emotion Friday night before spilling toward the Portland Trail Blazers' bench with 36.6 seconds left in Game 6 of the Western Conference finals.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, perhaps in a flashback to his playing days, Coach Mike Dunleavy decided to add emphasis to his team's 103-93 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers.</p>
        <p>As officials cleared away an altercation on the court, Dunleavy rushed to the defense of his players and jumped in the face of the instigator, the Lakers' Rick Fox. In yet another display of gamesmanship and the Trail Blazers' growing confidence, Dunleavy offered a few heated words that might make a lip reader blush. Both he and Fox were whistled for technical fouls.</p>
        <p>''I was asking him for a good restaurant in Los Angeles,'' Dunleavy said after the game, ''because I knew I was going to be down there this weekend.</p>
        <p>''In the fourth quarter, they started taking fouls, and they put a little extra mustard on those fouls. I don't think it was appreciated on our end. We know what they are trying to do -- take away from what we did in the game.''</p>
        <p>Avoiding elimination with stubbornness as much as skill, the Trail Blazers forced the Western Conference finals to Game 7, which will be played in Los Angeles at 7:30 p.m. Eastern time on Sunday. After losing twice on their home court, the Trail Blazers on Friday protected it as if they were pit bulls, and left the Lakers asking how a 3-1 lead in the four-of-seven-game series evaporated into Sunday's showdown at the Staples Center.</p>
        <p>The answer was equal parts of Lakers denial and Blazers defense.</p>
        <p>''I'm not shocked,'' Lakers Coach Phil Jackson said, dismissing any thoughts that his team might be reaching the panic stage. ''We anticipated this would be a seven-game series. I think they are fine. I they understand what this series is and what they are up against.They are not happy with their performance, that's for sure.''</p>
        <p>Brian Shaw also discounted the idea that the Lakers were under an undue strain. ''Obviously, it's been a big disappointment for us,'' he said, ''but I don't think there's any pressure.''</p>
        <p>The Blazers' focus in Game 6 was apparent from the start. Once again, they flung themselves at the Lakers from all angles and set a fast, physical pace. Portland's balanced scoring was led by Steve Smith, with 26 points. Bonzi Wells delivered the clinching performance by scoring 14 of his 20 points in the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>Wells, a backup guard in his second season, hit five of seven shots, made all four of his free throws, grabbed two rebounds and had two assists to help fend off any rallies by the Lakers. Often posting low on the smaller Shaw and Ron Harper, Wells suddenly became the focal point of the Blazers' offense.</p>
        <p>''It felt like street ball for a few minutes there,'' Wells said. ''You get your basket, I'll get my basket. Mine just kept going in.''</p>
        <p>Wells said he enjoyed playing against Shaw and Harper. ''I definitely like to explore those matchups, and my teammates know it,'' he said. ''I played some forward before in college, so I'm not a stranger to playing with my back to the basket.</p>
        <p>''Against them, it's just a matter of making my shots. They don't really respect me a lot, because I haven't done anything in the league yet. I'm the youngest guy on our team, and to have the guys go to me like that really means a lot.''</p>
        <p>Rasheed Wallace continued his fine series for Portland with 18 points, while Damon Stoudamire scored 14. Defensively, Arvydas Sabonis and his teammates stuck to Shaquille O'Neal like lint, holding the Lakers' center to 17 points on 7-of-17 shooting.</p>
        <p>Like O'Neal, Kobe Bryant played the entire game. Playing with a sprained foot from Game 5, Bryant scored 33 points. Beyond the Lakers' two stars, though, nobody was able to do much against Portland. Glen Rice and Shaw added 12 points each.</p>
        <p>The series will end at the Staples Center, although home-court advantage has not been much of a factor. The Blazers have the momentum and can become only the seventh team in National Basketball Association history to win a four-of-seven-game series after falling behind, three games to one.</p>
        <p>The Knicks were the last team to rally from a 3-1 deficit, beating the Miami Heat in the 1997 Eastern Conference semifinals. Such a comeback has never occurred in the Western Conference finals.</p>
        <p>''There's no momentum,'' Dunleavy said. ''There's no home-court advantage. It's one game now. You've got to come, and you've got to bring it.''</p>
