        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>For several months, those of us who pay attention have listened to the pundits pontificate about the race between former Gov. Jim Florio and former corporate chairman Jon S. Corzine for the Democratic Senatorial nomination. Missing from this discussion until recently has been any criticism of the most frightening aspect of this election: Mr. Corzine states that that he will spend whatever is needed to win.</p>
        <p>Certain Supreme Court Justices may think the approximately $30 million Mr. Corzine has spent in the primary is a matter of free expression, but some of us understand what has happened and are horrified.  Much of the New Jersey Democratic leadership has been bought outright, like a streetwalker picked up by a sugar daddy in a big limo, loaded with more cash than many of these local politicians have ever seen.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>For several months, those of us who pay attention have listened to the pundits pontificate about the race between former Gov. Jim Florio and former corporate chairman Jon S. Corzine for the Democratic Senatorial nomination. Missing from this discussion until recently has been any criticism of the most frightening aspect of this election: Mr. Corzine states that that he will spend whatever is needed to win.</p>
        <p>Certain Supreme Court Justices may think the approximately $30 million Mr. Corzine has spent in the primary is a matter of free expression, but some of us understand what has happened and are horrified.  Much of the New Jersey Democratic leadership has been bought outright, like a streetwalker picked up by a sugar daddy in a big limo, loaded with more cash than many of these local politicians have ever seen.</p>
        <p>In effect, the party pros have given New Jersey's Senate seat to the Republicans -- because whatever Mr. Corzine's merits as a corporate chief may have been, he is still not ready for a serious campaign. After months of campaigning he still reads his speeches, and when answering questions still shuffles through notes.  His program advocating all the good things means nothing to financially harassed voters. A slick Republican opponent will chew him up and spit him out in the general election.</p>
        <p>There are many good reasons for voting for Jim Florio. But this one reason is enough: Jon Corzine is smothering New Jersey Democrats in million dollar bills. We are active Democrats who are nauseated that this Democratic primary is being bought by Mr. Corzine and who are voting for Jim Florio on June 6.</p>
