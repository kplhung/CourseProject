        <p>Each day the dammed waters of the Euphrates River rise another three feet, encroaching on the present and the past in southeastern Turkey. While people in the modern village of Belkis abandon their homes, archaeologists are fighting a rear-guard action to save what they can from the ruins of Zeugma, once a thriving outpost on the eastern frontier of the Roman Empire. Theirs is a losing battle.</p>
        <p>When Turkey began building a hydroelectric dam near Belkis in 1992, few were aware of any significant ruins that would be endangered. But villagers, digging up their valuable pistachio trees, kept turning up building stones. Archaeologists eventually arrived on the scene and began digging, uncovering two large hillside villas. Despite pleas from scholars for more time to rescue artifacts, Turkish officials have refused to hold back the flood; the country is in desperate need of electric power. In a few days, the main excavation site will be inundated. By September, some 15,000 acres of the ancient city will be submerged.</p>
        <p>Hurried excavations at the site have yielded a trove of art and other artifacts from antiquity. Frescoes uncovered from the villas appear almost as fresh as when they were painted nearly 2,000 years ago. Beautiful mosaics depict a vanished culture's mythology. Many graceful stone columns stand in place, and around them are remains of walls and plumbing, iron window frames and lamps that illumined nights long ago.</p>
        <p>Christine Kondoleon, a curator at the Worcester Art Museum in Massachusetts, has just returned from a month's study at Zeugma, impressed and dispirited. ''It isn't quite Antioch,'' she says, referring to one of the richest sites in that part of the Roman world. ''But the extent of preservation is really unusual.''</p>
        <p>At its peak in the third century A. D., Zeugma prospered from caravan trade at the river crossing. Among its 70,000 residents were wealthy merchants and commanders of a Roman legion garrisoned there. They lived in imposing houses in the hills and imported artisans, probably from Antioch, to decorate them in a style befitting their lofty station. Before the century ended, Persians sacked Zeugma, leaving the ruins to be buried by time's accumulation of dirt. Only a few lines in contemporary records bore any written trace of the city's existence. But thick layers of clay sealed off the buried site from damaging moisture, accounting for the pristine state of much of the art.</p>
        <p>How much of Zeugma's exquisitely preserved past will be lost in the deluge is unclear. Because the city was built on a steep hillside, scholars think half of the city's still-buried ruins will remain above water. But of necessity, excavations have been quick and dirty, focused on the recovery of works of art and other remains of the wealthy.</p>
        <p>''What is lost is an understanding of the more humdrum aspects of a society -- where people of all strata lived and worked,'' says Stephen L. Dyson, a classics professor at suny Buffalo. ''The best archaeology is a discipline of social-economic history, not just art history.''</p>
