        <p>Even if, as the Beach Boys sang, everybody did have an ocean across the U.S.A., they still might not be surfin' like Californ-eye-ay. As any novice can attest, it's at least as hard as it looks.</p>

        <p>Even if, as the Beach Boys sang, everybody did have an ocean across the U.S.A., they still might not be surfin' like Californ-eye-ay. As any novice can attest, it's at least as hard as it looks.</p>
        <p>But this summer's fashionable beachcombers will be wearing their baggies and Archie sandals just like the guys on the water. The surf fashion trend, growing in recent years, has become a huge wave that is already breaking over department stores and other fashion outlets.</p>
        <p>To visit any big men's wear department is to wade into surf fashion's North Shore of Oahu. Tommy Hilfiger has traded in his house on Cape Cod for a little grass shack, turning his display area into a nylon rain forest of swaying palms and hibiscus flowers. Mr. Hilfiger was ridiculed early on by real surfers for sewing mesh briefs into its board shorts, but the label has learned its lesson, and has come back strong with some classic designs. At Ralph Lauren, there are wildly colored board shorts that may never get wet unless it rains. T-shirts in every conceivable surf-related pattern hang on racks shaped like surfboards.</p>
        <p>''Surf and tropical is, by far, the No. 1 summer trend,'' said Joseph Dinofrio, Macy's vice president for fashion. ''We started seeing little tastes of it last year, and now there's a full head on it.''</p>
        <p>''You don't see people like Michael Jordan knocking people who don't play professional basketball but wear Nike stuff,'' said Phil Browne,, who between surfaris around the world, catches waves in Lavallette and Seaside Heights, and works at Wave Jammer, a surf shop in Toms River. And, he said, ''It seems like more people are kind of, 'Well, I dress the part, why not try it?' ''</p>
        <p>Surfing has been a part of American pop culture since the 1960's, when California bands recorded hits harmonizing over borrowed Chuck Berry guitar riffs, and Bruce Brown released his quintessential surf film  ''The Endless Summer.''</p>
        <p>These days the pursuit of a good wave takes place on the Jersey Shore from Sandy Hook to Cape May</p>
        <p>And more surfers is good news, some people believe, because more surfers means more political muscle.</p>
        <p>The Surfrider Foundation, an environmental group made up mostly of surfers, has been among the leading opponents of ocean dumping off Sandy Hook. It has also successfully fought surfing bans at municipal beaches on the Jersey Shore in Deal, Ortley Beach, Point Pleasant and elsewhere.</p>
        <p>''People do get connected to the environment via articles in surfer magazines,'' said Kristin Milligan, 29, of South Belmar, a marine biologist with the Clean Ocean Action environmental group, who builds, her own surfboards.</p>
        <p>Then again, she added, ''A lot of surfers are some of the least environmentally aware people I've ever seen. I mean, they trash the beach. Like, their surf wax? It comes in plastic? And they leave that plastic on the beach.''</p>
