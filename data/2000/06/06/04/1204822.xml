        <p>They are gardening again at Chernobyl.</p>
        <p>Rounding the last corner on the road to the destroyed reactor of Unit No. 4 at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, the most striking discovery at the site of the worst radiation accident in history was the two young women in white masks picking gingerly at the earth with hoes and rakes.</p>
        <p>They were preparing a flower bed in the shadow of the ''sarcophagus,'' the mammoth concrete and steel structure, riddled with leaks and cracks, that now encases the shattered reactor hall where nearly 200 tons of radioactive fuel lie melted and fused with sand, concrete and other debris from the explosion and fire that erupted on April 26, 1986.</p>
        <p>''Ordinarily, we would have had flowers growing long ago,'' said Katya Premak, 33, explaining why nothing was coming out of the ground so late in the spring. ''But we are going very slow,'' she added, leaning on her hoe.</p>
        <p>''Last week, they found a hot spot over there,'' she said, pointing to where a scoop of earth had set off a radiation monitor during a routine sweep. ''We wear these masks because we are stirring up the dust and it can be dangerous.''</p>
        <p>To any visitor, it seems more than unusual that thousands of people still come to work here every day, 14 years after a disaster that killed 28 people outright with high radiation doses and touched off a still accelerating epidemic of thyroid cancers among children who lived downwind of the plant.</p>
        <p>Finally, something is to change.</p>
        <p>President Leonid Kuchma has declared that Ukraine will close the last operating reactor at Chernobyl, Unit No. 3, sometime this year. He said he would announce a specific closing date during the visit to Kiev by President Clinton on June 5 and 6.</p>
        <p>''We ourselves want to shut down the last remaining unit,'' Mr. Kuchma said in an interview in Kiev, Ukraine's capital, just 80 miles to the south. ''So this is not a political game. We will shut it down.''</p>
        <p>But the shutdown is only the beginning of a new chapter in the life of the ill-fated power station, whose radioactive wastes and debris must be guarded for decades, if not centuries, to prevent them from further poisoning the environment. Not only do tens of thousands of Ukrainians depend on the plant for jobs and power, but Ukraine faces an acute energy crisis, even now, before Chernobyl is closed. Despite intensive medical investigations into the health effects of the huge amount of radiation released from the explosion and fire that ripped through reactor No. 4 in 1986 after an experiment went disastrously wrong, the overall health of the plant workers remains good, though more questions than answers remain about Chernobyl's long-term effects.</p>
        <p>The biggest question is who will pay for what needs to be done here. Since 1986, Chernobyl's endgame has been marked by unceasing recriminations among Ukraine, the United States and the world's six other wealthiest industrial nations over financing for major decommissioning projects and the replacement of Chernobyl's electrical output.</p>
        <p>Ukraine would like to complete two nuclear power plants that were under construction in western Ukraine before the Soviet Union collapsed, but the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, responsible for Western financing, has failed to offer lending terms Ukraine can afford, in the view of Mr. Kuchma and his government.</p>
        <p>''The electricity deficit has been catastrophic in our industries, so if we just shut down a unit that has been producing one million watts,'' Mr. Kuchma said, referring to Chernobyl, ''it will be a complete disaster for the Ukrainian economy because nuclear power is the cheapest.''</p>
        <p>As it is, controllers from Kiev enforce rotating blackouts for as long as eight hours a day in many parts of the country.</p>
        <p>Even if Chernobyl closes, the costs of monitoring what happens inside the sarcophagus, and keeping radiation firmly encased inside, will run on. A permanent corps of safety engineers is needed. Moreover, a new sarcophagus costing as much as $750 million will probably have to be built, since the current one rests on potentially unstable foundations and suffers from intrusions of rainwater that create clouds of humidity in the radioactive darkness, corroding the maze of pipes and steel girders and increasing the risk of collapse.</p>
        <p>A plant for processing radioactive waste will be needed, and a $100 million heating plant and new electricity supplies to run all the support facilities. Leaders of the seven wealthiest nations have pledged about $400 million of the money needed for the sarcophagus, but Mr. Kuchma said Western aid had been slow to materialize.</p>
        <p>''It's not like closing a big door and putting a big lock in place and then forgetting about it,'' he said. ''We have to continue servicing this plant.''</p>
        <p>In the interview, Mr. Kuchma indicated that Ukraine would seek Russian help if necessary to replace Chernobyl's electrical output, a step that would undermine the Western goal of reinforcing Ukrainian independence at a time when President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia is emphasizing the ''common roots'' between his country and Ukraine.</p>
        <p>''We will probably look for a compromise with Russia because 90 percent of the equipment in these plants was made in Russia and so economically and politically it's highly profitable and interesting to the Russians,'' Mr. Kuchma said.</p>
        <p>His remarks may have been intended to put pressure on the West in advance of the July meeting of the Group of Seven leaders with Russia in Okinawa, but he nevertheless is under considerable pressure at home, where the energy sector is notoriously corrupt even as major industries go begging for electricity supplies.</p>
        <p>Then there is the question of what to do about Slavutich, the city of 28,000 built in the 1980's to house Chernobyl's corps of engineers.</p>
        <p>Units No. 1 and 2 of Chernobyl operated until the early 1990's. Unit No. 2 was shut down in 1991 after a fire swept through its turbine hall,  causing extensive damage, though not to the reactor. And President Kuchma agreed to shut down Unit No. 1 in 1994 after pledges from the Group of Seven to help finance an overall plan to decommission the Chernobyl complex -- assistance that has been halting at times.</p>
        <p>From Slavutich, Chernobyl's denizens ride an electric train 40 minutes to ''the zone,'' the depopulated area of abandoned farms and villages where 135,000 people once lived within an 18-mile radius of the plant.</p>
        <p>Where once there was farmland, weeds and brambles have taken  over, enveloping houses and hiding earthen mounds where radioactive trucks and bulldozers are buried, and equipment yards where irradiated helicopters that dumped tons of sand and boron on the burning reactor still are quarantined. Some pilots died from the radiation.</p>
        <p>In man-made canals that once carried cooling water to and from the reactor, hefty carp and catfish have taken over. And in the nearby forests the swelling deer population has attracted poachers who ply the trails of the zone at night.</p>
        <p>In the aftermath of 1986, Chernobyl became a symbol of nuclear devastation that incited a numbing fear in Ukraine and Belarus, a fear that researchers suggest has so far been more destructive to public health than the huge release of radiation. The accident also laid bare industrial incompetence and a contempt for the environment that helped to fracture the Soviet edifice.</p>
        <p>But for the 6,000 Chernobyl workers and their dependents today in independent Ukraine, the power station represents more than anything a paycheck and a guaranteed apartment when so many in the former Soviet Union are without both.</p>
        <p>''I was a student in electrical engineering in Moscow and came here two years after the accident,'' said Irina A. Kolbich, who works for the plant administration. ''Frankly I came for financial reasons because living here on 1,300 rubles a month with your own apartment was better than living in Moscow on 130 rubles a month with no apartment.''</p>
        <p>Vladimir A. Komarov calls himself ''a patriot of Chernobyl'' because he has worked here for 20 years. ''If you talk to our experts, all  agree that this plant could be operated until 2006 or maybe longer,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The culture of safety still is not exactly pervasive. Neither Ms. Premak nor her co-worker, Natasha Poplegina, were wearing their radiation dosimeters while gardening.</p>
        <p>''We are supposed to wear them all the time, but I keep mine in my locker,'' Ms. Premak said.</p>
        <p>In the flower bed, the radiation, though low, was about four times higher than the naturally occurring levels in the environment. ''Since you don't see it, who knows what to expect anyway?'' Ms. Poplegina said.</p>
        <p>On the deck that overlooks the sarcophagus, where Vice President Al Gore stood briefly during his visit to Chernobyl in 1997, the radiation  goes from 4 times to 10 times the  naturally occurring level, still not necessarily dangerous but not recommended for extended exposure.</p>
        <p>Control Room No. 3 operates Chernobyl's last functioning nuclear dynamo. On a recent afternoon, Alexander N. Yelchishev, 46, a shift supervisor, monitored the reactor closely.</p>
        <p>A veteran of Unit No. 4, Mr. Yelchishev lost a classmate and a neighbor to radiation poisoning in 1986. Still, he remains a believer in nuclear power, and laments that the closing  of Unit No. 3 will constitute a waste of about $300 million in safety improvements financed by the United States and other Western donors.</p>
        <p>The fixes are intended to prevent the reactor from surging out of control, as Unit No. 4 did during a low power test in 1986, setting off steam and hydrogen explosions that ripped apart the graphite reactor core, blew off the roof and spewed radioactive material into the atmosphere for days.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yelchishev does not blame the West for the pressure to close Chernobyl as much as he blames Ukraine's leaders for allowing corruption and inept reforms to retard  economic development.</p>
        <p>In the accident, about 50 tons of radioactive dust and debris was carried by winds and rain to virtually every country in the Northern Hemisphere, but the worst contamination was in the areas near the zone, especially southern Belarus.</p>
        <p>Thyroid cancer rates have increased tenfold in Ukraine and as much as 84 times in parts of Belarus. In 1996, about 800 thyroid cancers had appeared in Ukraine and Belarus, but the numbers have since risen sharply and continue to climb.</p>
        <p>''As of today, we have operated on about 1,500 children in Ukraine alone,'' said Dr. Valery P. Tereshchenko of the Institute for Endocrinology and Metabolism in Kiev.</p>
        <p>The health effects from other long-life radioactive elements, like cesium and strontium, have been difficult to measure. There have been no clusters of leukemia or other cancers in the fallout zones where the thyroid cancers have appeared, but the latency period for other health effects may be longer, experts say.</p>
        <p>A United Nations conference on Chernobyl concluded in 1996 that the only clear change evident in health to date was a ''highly significant'' increase in thyroid cancer rates among people who were children in 1986 in the affected areas.</p>
        <p>''To tell you the truth,'' said Dr. Mykola D. Tronko, director of Ukraine's thyroid cancer institute, ''even 14 years after the accident, we have more questions than answers.''</p>
