        <p>On a wet, blustery April morning, mist blowing sideways across the docks marking the lower end of Union Street on the Brooklyn waterfront, 17-year-old Alice Warren-Gregory races down the steps from her family's third-floor apartment a little after 5:30 a.m. Clutching a calculator and a copy of ''The Great Gatsby,'' she hurries up the block in the predawn darkness to catch a waiting B71 bus. As we step on board, the driver says, ''Good morning, Alice,'' and closes the door.</p>
        <p>''I got four hours of sleep the night before, and I went to bed at 1 a.m. last night,'' Alice says grumpily, settling into a seat and opening her book. We have barely gone a block, and she is already fretting about how far behind she is. ''I was supposed to write my essay on 'Song of Solomon' for English, but I didn't get to it,'' she says. ''I had to do my laundry.'' The topics of this early-morning conversation -- laundry, homework, her guitar lessons, the boring party in Manhattan over the weekend -- form little tiles in the typical mosaic of teenage ennui.</p>
        <p>But as the empty bus lumbers down into the Gowanus flats and up toward Prospect Park, strange words and phrases begin tumbling from Alice's lips. ''Synaptic plasticity.'' ''Hippocampus.'' ''Long-term potentiation.'' She isn't talking about things she has learned from a textbook; she is talking about the stuff and ideas of contemporary brain research, things she'll be working with later that same day. Indeed, she is talking about a science project she is pursuing after school under the guidance of Constantine Pavlides, who happens to be a world-class neuroscientist at Rockefeller University in New York and a leading researcher on the role of stress in the neurophysiology of memory and learning.</p>
        <p>The Pavlides lab, she says, has been pursuing a theory suggesting that animals -- presumably including humans -- convert the things they learn during their waking hours into long-term memory during the period of sleep characterized by rapid eye movement, or REM sleep, which also happens to be the peak period for dreaming. It is on the leading edge of modern scientific research, and Alice, who just took her College Boards and still doesn't know where she wants to go to college, spends part of every school day living on that edge. ''If you deprive animals of REM sleep, they have lots of trouble, like with spatial relationships,'' Alice explains. ''Kind of like me,'' she adds with a laugh. ''Dr. Pavlides was explaining this to me, and I'm, like, yeah, two things I know a lot about -- stress and lack of sleep.''</p>
        <p>Alice's typical 18-hour school day begins before 6 a.m. As a junior at Midwood High School in Brooklyn, she attends one of the most overcrowded, antiquated, ethnically diverse and, in terms of science education, unusually successful schools in New York City's public school system. She is one of approximately 60 students in the class of 2001 known informally as ''Intel kids'' -- gifted students who literally sign a contract promising to devote several precious years of their teenage lives, weekends and summers usually included, to conducting original independent research and competing in a series of local and national science competitions, culminating in the prestigious Science Talent Search sponsored each year by the Intel Corporation (formerly by Westinghouse). Since 1990, Midwood High School has produced 112 semifinalists, one of the best records in the nation.</p>
        <p>A generation ago the kind of students who entered science fairs were considered nerds -- preternaturally bright kids whose ardent intellects, moire-patterned wardrobes and clueless social instincts put them outside the adolescent mainstream. Geeks still roam the halls of American high schools -- and of Midwood, for that matter -- but many of Midwood's Intel kids move comfortably in the newly respectable mainstream, where being scientifically astute has a certain cachet. They inhabit an area of cultural endeavor that -- coming a quarter-century after the birth of biotechnology and personal computers and, yes, the rise of Nasdaq -- is now seen not only as intellectually precocious but also, suddenly, improbably, as positioned in a fast lane pointed toward wealth, creature comforts and the freedom to choose what to make of one's life.</p>
        <p>At a place like Midwood, which draws on a less elite population than city schools with admission exams, like the traditional powerhouses Stuyvesant and the Bronx High School of Science, the Intel contest provides the flame that heats a new, high-tech version of the melting pot myth. Many of the students competing for next year's prizes lived just a few years ago in places like Uzbekistan, Ukraine, Vietnam and Bangladesh, and English is often a second language. Many come from households with difficult financial or familial circumstances. Like a test-tube version of the teenage strivers immortalized in the movie ''Fame,'' they see the science-fair competitions as a path to attention and acclaim, to scholarship money and a better college education and, ultimately, to a better life. For many students, merely doing the research and producing a paper is a transforming experience.</p>
        <p>But it comes at tremendous sacrifice. ''Everyone who has worked in my lab has gone to Harvard, Yale, Brown, all Ivy League schools,'' Alice says. ''I really feel a pressure to perform.'' That pressure often chases an otherwise lovely smile from Alice's face; in more relaxed moments she can be sassy, irreverent, insightful and unusually self-aware, but like many Intel kids, she has her eyes firmly latched on the prize. ''I think it's really good to have something like Intel, because it gives you focus,'' she says. ''I think some people in high school lose sight, and then they get to their senior year and find that they've gotten caught up in trivial things. Right now is a really good time to work hard at something.''</p>
        <p>In these days of standards-based education, the Intel competition functions as a kind of ex officio nationwide Regents test for the best and the brightest. It is often referred to -- in Intel news releases, certainly -- as ''the Nobel Prize of high school students,'' and kids who reach the finals and semifinals get lots of attention. What rarely gets described is the gestalt of life as a burgeoning adolescent intellect -- the incredibly long days, the hard and heady work, the inevitable shedding of many quotidian pleasures of teenage life (dating, participating in sports, listening to or making music) in order to conduct advanced lab research. As Alice puts it: ''There are people in the Intel program at school who have social lives. I just don't happen to be one of them.''</p>
        <p>After leaving the subway and stopping for a bagel with cream cheese (''This is probably the last thing I'll have to eat until 7 o'clock tonight''), Alice walks briskly to Brooklyn College, where Midwood students attend some of their college-level advanced-placement classes. The first to arrive, she sits on the floor of a long, empty corridor interrupted only by a succession of cranberry-colored steel doors, all locked. ''My mom is really concerned about my health,'' Alice says at one point. ''She thinks I have an eating disorder. But I just don't have time to eat, that's the problem.''</p>
        <p>Unexpectedly, a little fear creeps into her voice. Her mother, she continues, recently announced her desire to leave New York -- the sooner she could move, the better. Alice interprets this development as a potentially devastating disruption of all her dreams -- of staying at Midwood, of completing her Intel project, of getting into a top-drawer East Coast college. ''I just want to finish up at Midwood,'' she says, swallowing hard, staring straight ahead. ''But as it stands now, I really have no place to go.'' Shortly after sunrise, she is deep into the day's first crisis.</p>
        <p>At 7 a.m., the chemistry teacher, Alan Finkelstein, arrives and unlocks the classroom door, and Alice, along with 30 or so other sleepy-eyed students, files into the room. Finkelstein wordlessly begins to write a problem on the board. ''The electrolysis of an aqueous solution of potassium iodide results in the formation of hydrogen gas at the cathode and. . . . '' Like everyone else, Alice gets out her calculator and begins solving what, for her, is a far more tractable kind of problem.</p>
        <p>'The Scientific 'Hood'</p>
        <p>It has always been hard to be a high school intellectual. my 1967 high school yearbook contains a photograph of the Science Seminar club. Eight students, all boys. No one is smiling. It would be easy to make fun of the horn-rimmed glasses and bold plaid shirts, but what is most striking to me is the body language: the tense, tight-lipped posture of defensiveness, as if being smart, clever and intellectually adventurous singled you out for ridicule. The damning adjective for any teenager from that era was ''mature.'' That was code for smart, responsible and virtually incapable of the puerile, thrill-seeking, predatory, reckless and authority-defying behavior so essential to adolescent self-esteem.</p>
        <p>I wasn't in that picture, but only because the brainiacs at my suburban Chicago high school left me in the dust. I don't believe the word ''geek'' had entered the lexicon then, but the sense of the word surely had: kids gifted in science and math inhabited a rarefied universe, where everything intellectual was easy and everything social was hard. Or so it seemed. In reality, I have come around to the view that science institutionalizes the need to challenge your strongest convictions with rigorous thought, which is one reason it constantly chases the New and is now, arguably, a much more interesting avant-garde than, say, art. And there comes a moment, sooner or later, when we all admire its creativity and yearn for its interventions. One of the ''kids'' in that photograph, Douglas Brash, is now a professor at Yale who has played a leading role in explaining why we risk developing cancer when we sunbathe -- molecular explanations that may lead to molecular interventions and treatments for the growing epidemic of skin cancer.</p>
        <p>While geekdom has not totally been erased from the culture of high school science, the difference at Midwood is immediately apparent. In Alice's junior research class, taught by Stanley Shapiro, an enthusiastic, joke-spewing instructor who has a Ph.D. in chemistry and coordinates the science research program at Midwood, girls outnumber boys by almost 2 to 1, as they do in the entire program. And plastic shirt-pocket pen protectors don't live here anymore. Maria Bouzas, a junior, stands in front of the class describing her research project; she is wearing baggy blue pants, a loose gray sweatshirt and a light green kerchief around her streaked hair and sports a stainless-steel diamond-shaped stud through her lower lip. After describing the molecular biology of diabetes, and some particularly grisly techniques she has learned in a laboratory at Brooklyn College, someone in the class asked, ''You did that?''</p>
        <p>Maria suddenly brightened. ''Yeah, man,'' she gushed. ''I broke my way into the scientific 'hood!'' (I later learned that she also rides dirt bikes on the weekend and subscribes to a motocross magazine.)</p>
        <p>Everyone at Midwood seems to have a story. Alice, for example, lives in an apartment in Carroll Gardens with her mother and younger sister. Her mother works as a massage therapist at a Y.M.C.A. in Manhattan; she has hired a baby sitter so that Alice can do her after-school research at Rockefeller until 7 p.m. and not have to pick up her 7-year-old sister, Karyn, after school. To pay for the sitter, she has to work longer hours, which means she rarely sees Alice during the school week. ''I'm usually in bed before she gets home,'' Alice said. Alice often leaves for school before her mother wakes up.</p>
        <p>I noticed that Alice mentioned her mother a lot, but her father not at all. ''He's not a factor,'' she said in a strenuously neutral voice. She had written a poem about him, she told me, that appeared in Patterns, Midwood's literary magazine; it describes a daughter going to visit her father after he has undergone drug rehabilitation. ''Three weeks was long enough,'' it reads, ''For him to see/how slowly he was killing me/How waiting to find your father strung out/over cold, white, bathroom tile/was enough to rip your soul to shreds.'' Alice has a grade-point average of 97.1 and recently totalled 1490 on her College Boards.</p>
        <p>As Jay Touger, one of three research advisers at the school, put it, ''You never know, looking at these kids, what life has done for them, or to them.'' Ananya Das's family, which belonged to the Hindu minority living in Moslem-dominated Bangladesh, fled the country in 1994 after increasing incidents of religious violence, including the kidnapping and rape of young Hindu girls; she is studying perception and the visual system at a lab at Brooklyn College. Mong Thi Le, who goes by the name Meagan, is a quietly brilliant 17-year-old who emigrated with her family from Saigon in 1996 and now has a grade-point average of 96.23. Anti-Semitism forced the family of Marianna Shnayderman, one of a large contingent of Russian emigres at the school, to leave Kiev in 1991; in addition to having been an Intel semifinalist, she will be Midwood's valedictorian at graduation ceremonies this month. Eugene Simuni, another Russian, came to the United States less than three years ago, yet finished higher than any other New York City student in this year's Intel contest. His classmate Emmanuelle St. Jean, the daughter of Haitian immigrants, was the only African-American among the Top 40 Intel finalists. Shapiro likes to tell the story about the time one former student needed to supply a Social Security number to fill out a science-fair application, which is how it was discovered that she was, technically, an illegal alien.</p>
        <p>'A Lot of People, Like, Don't Even Know That I'm Smart'</p>
        <p>Midwood may be an especially comfortable place to be smart. It's competitive -- everyone seems to know everyone else's grade-point average, down to the hundredth place, and students can have a 90 average and still rank 200th in their class. But many of the Intel students glide in and out of their elite subculture without passports or apologies.</p>
        <p>''I don't think of myself as being smart -- I think of myself as being normal,'' says Emmanuelle, who chose Barnard over Harvard for college. Diana Murakhovskaya, a senior who is also editor of the school's science magazine, Prism, says: ''I don't see myself as a geek. I have my smart friends. I have my museum friends. I have friends I go to clubs with on the weekend. A lot of people, like, don't even know that I'm smart.''</p>
        <p>With its six Ionic columns and its Georgian cupola, the architecture of Midwood High School makes an outdated argument for a traditional, even classical, education in a neighborhood, and world, that has changed around it. The school was built to accommodate 2,800 students, mostly from the Irish, Italian and Jewish families that used to live nearby, but now nearly 4,000 crowd its hallways. In addition to its two gifted programs, for medical science and for the humanities, it is also the zoned high school for Midwood and surrounding neighborhoods, with their predominantly minority populations; the school is just over 40 percent African-American, 31 percent white, 19 percent Asian and 9 percent Hispanic, although the research program is much less heterogenous.</p>
        <p>In many respects, Midwood is as up to date as any high school in the nation. Students affect a hip urban nomad look, lugging enormous backpacks, athletic bags, coats and lacrosse sticks from room to room. (No one is allowed to use the lockers anymore because thefts became so rampant.) The Intel students typically avoid the crowded cafeteria and eat lunch in class (everything from takeout barbecue to mocha Frappuccinos). They can get credit for phys ed by taking the ''cheese bus'' (the classic yellow schoolbus) to a bowling alley or billiards parlor. And the school newspaper recently ran an article entitled ''Should Cross-Dressing Be Allowed at the Prom?''</p>
        <p>But time has stood still at Midwood in the worst possible way: its physical plant is a running joke among students and teachers. When I marveled at the beautiful 1940's-era glass-paneled cabinetry in some of the science labs, the principal, Lewis Frohlich, barked: ''I don't need museum pieces. I need modern equipment and facilities.'' (He is about to get his wish: after nearly six years of bureaucratic and community delays, Midwood hopes to begin construction on a $22 million state-of-the-art science annex across Bedford Avenue from the school in the fall of 2001.)</p>
        <p>And yet Midwood's shabby facilities also prove the point that dedicated teachers mean more than modern equipment. Midwood's two Intel finalists this year worked under Touger's tutelage. Ann Nicastri, who was a Westinghouse semifinalist in the 1950's, guides research students in biology. When you ask students why Midwood has been so successful in recent Intel competitions, they invariably mention the close and informal rapport with their teachers, and after watching their interaction over several months, I realized that in order to push students to their limits, and perhaps a little beyond, you need to know them very well. Recently, for example, when Alice began to feel a little overwhelmed, she went in to see Shapiro and ''yenta,'' as he put it, about all the stress she felt in her life -- how she was burning the candle at both ends, working too hard, tired all the time. ''My reaction was, 'Good,''' Shapiro told me later. ''That's what I like to see in my students.''</p>
        <p>''We ask the kids to do the impossible,'' Touger said. ''We ask them to do the equivalent of a master's thesis or a graduate thesis on a topic they know nothing about at first, and to do it in one year. And they do it. Year after year, they do it.''</p>
        <p>Room 256</p>
        <p>The first time I encountered Alice, she had come into room 256 -- technically a prep room for the physical science teachers, but in practice a kind of clubroom for Midwood's teenage intelligentsia -- with an excuse. Her English teacher had lost the only (handwritten) copy of the essay she had done on ''Scientific Attitude,'' one of five essays that form part of the Intel contest application. Shapiro looked at her skeptically -- as much, it seemed, because she preferred writing in longhand to using a computer. They bantered back and forth, and somehow the discussion turned to the way that kids, even in rural areas, can become interested in science. Shapiro mentioned the movie ''October Sky,'' about young rocket enthusiasts growing up in West Virginia. Alice, whose attitude can fairly be said to lean toward the humorously unsentimental, made a ribald remark about the recreational practices of teenage boys in rural America. In my day the comment might have earned a suspension, or at least a lecture. Here, everyone laughed.</p>
        <p>Room 256, in other words, is the place where the traditional boundaries of authority and deference between students and teachers break down. The atmosphere of adult collegiality in turn creates an environment of adult expectation. Room 256 has high ceilings, high windows and an unbelievable amount of clutter, including half a dozen models of the solar system, quaintly obsolete electrical devices, the odd box of rocks, bottles of chemicals with yellowing labels, one computer for a dozen teachers and a ceiling fan that, upon closer inspection, is a floor fan lashed to the ceiling.</p>
        <p>On any given morning around 8:30, several seniors invariably gather in the room around a 12-foot worktable. The conversation veers into molecular biology or computer models of traffic flow, then just as quickly back to plans for the prom. Diana, who is a dark-haired 18-year-old born in Odessa and an Intel semifinalist this year, goes clubbing on the weekend with Marianna, the class valedictorian, and other girls from Midwood. But she can tell you more than you could possibly want to know about the reactivity of ATP synthase molecules on the surface of cancer cells. She plans to get an engineering degree from Cooper Union. ''I probably want to start my own business,'' she said. ''Or belong to a corporation -- like, be the boss of it.''</p>
        <p>Ross Krupnik, 17, a genial and thoughtful student who lives in Sheepshead Bay, also did some original research on ATP synthase. ''We have, like, clashing results,'' he admitted, nodding toward Diana.</p>
        <p>''Yeah,'' she replied, ''but mine are being published.''</p>
        <p>Steven Beigelmacher, 18, spent one morning lecturing the others on his empirically derived technique for pouring hot coffee into a thin plastic cup without its melting; a computer jock, he will spend the summer calculating pensions for retired city firemen before attending Carnegie-Mellon University in the fall.</p>
        <p>They don't, however, spend all their time reciting equations. One day, Diana announced that having finally turned 18, she had made a long-anticipated appointment to go sky diving this month. Someone asked if she liked para-sailing; she shook her head and said it was too boring. Instead of going to the prom, she and some friends have rented a limo and plan to go to dinner and clubbing before catching a bus to Ocean City, N.J., for a day of jet skiing at the beach.</p>
        <p>''If there was a television show, Room 256 would be the place,'' said Martin Langan, the assistant principal for the school's science department. ''This is like the teacher's version of M*A*S*H.'' The scene even came with goofy public-address announcements. ''Today's meeting of the Islamic Society has been canceled,'' went a voice over the loudspeaker. ''Thank you. Have a good day today, and a better day tomorrow.''</p>
        <p>The (Rube) Goldberg Variations</p>
        <p>Alice, who was born in California and moved to Brooklyn when she was in the fifth grade, entered the research program as a sophomore because of her exceptional performance in science classes. ''I didn't ask to be an Intel student,'' she explained one day as we walked to her lab at Rockefeller. ''They just sort of put me into it without asking. My mom's reaction was, 'This is what we wanted!' and I said, 'We'?''</p>
        <p>''There was a little hesitation,'' confirmed her mother, Patricia Gregory. ''She can be very, very hard on herself, and has to be perfect. She wasn't sure she could handle it as well as her schoolwork. But I felt she was too young not to take risks.'' By May of last year, she placed first in Midwood's annual sophomore science fair and was on her Intel way.</p>
        <p>The most promising science students at Midwood, approximately 105 freshmen, are steered into the research program. During their first two years, the students take classes in research methods, develop critical thinking and are encouraged to submit entries as sophomores in various science fairs. ''If you can't get 95's easily, then you better drop out, because you won't be able to keep up with your schoolwork,'' Shapiro said. ''And it's usually self-selection out.'' By sophomore year, the total in the program is down to 95, and by junior year the number is about 60.</p>
        <p>The advanced level of the research adds a layer of incomprehensibility to the already fitful conversation between parents and teenagers. ''My dad, like, didn't even know I was in Intel until he saw my picture in The Daily News,'' Diana told me. Lauren Mikulski, a senior, said describing her research project to her family was difficult because ''we had a vocabulary in the lab that isn't even in the dictionary, it's so new.'' When she showed her father a draft of her research paper, he said it was good. ''But did you understand it?'' she continued. ''No,'' he confessed. Not an unusual reaction, except that Lauren's father teaches organic chemistry at Brooklyn Technical High School.</p>
        <p>The sheer workload and commuting time -- getting to school by 7 a.m., taking the subway to labs -- makes the day especially long. During the summer following her sophomore year, Alice stayed with family friends who lived closer to Midwood while taking a course in molecular biology. She began to hang out with two other Intel students who lived nearby, Daniel Shaw and Etan Marciano. ''Those guys are so funny,'' she said at one point. Indeed, as sophomores the two boys parlayed their humor into the winning entry in the Rube Goldberg contest held last year at the New York City Science Fair. Their device was a monument to high-precision superfluous engineering, designed to deposit cereal and milk in a bowl mechanically, and to do so in exactly 60 seconds. ''Breakfast for One,'' they called it.</p>
        <p>When I went to visit him one Saturday afternoon, Daniel was playing Chopin's Waltz in C Sharp Minor on the piano in the living room of his family's home in Ditmas Park. A junior at Midwood, Daniel, 16, had just come home from playing tennis and later that night would be hanging out with his girlfriend. I had first met Daniel on a Tuesday afternoon at Midwood when he came into Room 256 to meet with Shapiro and discuss the first draft of one of his Intel essays. He had jet black hair, slicked back, and wore baggy pants and tennis shoes, which in one sweeping motion he planted firmly on Shapiro's desk. Juniors like Daniel and Alice are encouraged to engage in a version of what Jay Touger calls ''six degrees of separation,'' in which the brother of the father of a friend of a friend might know someone who runs a laboratory in Brooklyn or Manhattan and might be approached to work as a mentor. A student was once placed at N.Y.U. Medical Center through someone who knew a custodian there.</p>
        <p>While Midwood might be accused of tailoring its program too specifically to successful Intel applications, there was nothing narrow about the discussion between Shapiro and Daniel. It was a stream-of-consciousness conversation that had almost nothing to do with science but everything to do with two associative, nimble intellects jumping from one topic of interest to another, highbrow erudition tussling with lowbrow humor the entire way.</p>
        <p>While eating his lunch, Shapiro perused the first few paragraphs of Daniel's essay on ''Scientific Attitude.'' ''Yeah, clever stuff,'' he grunted approvingly. ''I didn't know you played the piano.''</p>
        <p>''I play three instruments,'' Daniel replied. ''The piano, the cello and the bass guitar.''</p>
        <p>''Too bad you didn't go to the High School for the Performing Arts.''</p>
        <p>''Yeah,'' Daniel laughed, ''I could be a starving artist instead of a starving scientist.''</p>
        <p>''What kind of pieces?'' Shapiro asked, referring to the music. ''Are you talking about 'Mary Had a Little Lamb'?''</p>
        <p>''No, no,'' Daniel protested. ''I was decent. I can play Beethoven sonatas. The 'Moonlight Sonata.' 'Pathetique.' Chopin waltzes.''</p>
        <p>''Can you play the 'Appassionata'?'' Shapiro asked.</p>
        <p>''No,'' Daniel said with a knowing laugh. ''But that was always my goal.''</p>
        <p>''So who was Haydn's favorite composer?'' Daniel scrunched up his face and half-heartedly suggested Beethoven. Shapiro shook his head. ''And it wasn't Mozart, either,'' he said. ''His name was von Weber, who almost no one has heard about. It's beautiful stuff, but no one knows about him.'' The conversation moved on to 12-tone scales and then, somehow, to gefilte fish. ''Did you know,'' Shapiro said, ''that Mrs. Goldberg, the chemistry teacher, makes her own gefilte fish? And it's fabulous.''</p>
        <p>''Those are two words,'' Daniel said firmly, packing up his books, ''that should never appear in the same sentence -- gefilte' and 'fabulous.'''</p>
        <p>On the Saturday afternoon I visited Daniel, we crossed Argyle Road to Etan's house, and the two boys fetched the Rube Goldberg device from the basement. While setting up the apparatus, they talked about the research they were conducting for their Intel projects. Rube would not have approved.</p>
        <p>Through an uncle who is an orthopedic surgeon, Daniel had found a position working in a lab at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine, testing the effect of naturally occurring estrogens (known as phyto-estrogens) on bone-forming cells known as osteoblasts; this has suddenly become a hot avenue of research lately because of concerns about hormone replacement therapy for postmenopausal women. Etan, meanwhile, was working with psychiatric researchers at Columbia University who were investigating the biology of several drugs that seemed to mimic the symptoms of schizophrenia.</p>
        <p>''Ready?'' Etan said, with a sly self-aware smile, after they had set up the device. ''Ready to be amazed?'' It doesn't translate readily into words but involved a golf ball rolling down a tube that hit a lever (which caused cereal to fall into a bowl) and then knocked another ball, which caused a container of milk to tip over, slowly filling the cereal bowl until the weight completed a circuit underneath the bowl that turned on a motor, which removed a nail from the lower end of the tubing, allowing the golf ball to descend and then plop into a little basket and activate a pulley, which lifted it, as the rules required, exactly 30 centimeters above the surface, returning the ball to its starting height.</p>
        <p>It was a little hard to reconcile the geeky exuberance of their creation with the heavy exertion usually required to maintain teenage indifference, and I was curious if Daniel and Etan felt the same defensiveness that characterized the students in the picture from my yearbook. ''We're friends with people on the lacrosse team that we hang out with,'' Daniel explained. ''We hang out with a lot of kids who are, quote, popular, although they do make fun of us all the time and call us nerds. But,'' he added with a triumphant smile, ''we have better grades than they do.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps the shrewdest observation came from Lauren Mikulski. ''I think a lot of people perceive that the Intel students are supersmart and dorks,'' she admitted. ''But there is so much cultural diversity at Midwood, I guess, that you don't see it as much.'' Brilliance, in other words, is just another form of diversity at a school with an Islamic Society and Gay-Straight Alliance. As Marc Ostrega, a teacher, put it one day, science is just another alternative lifestyle.</p>
        <p>For Every Action, an Equal and Opposite Reaction</p>
        <p>Whether you are an athlete or an intellect, there is nothing more humbling than the day you discover that you are no longer among the best, after having been there for so long. For a lot of students in the research program, that day came on Jan. 10, when all 44 Midwood seniors who entered the Intel competition filed into a classroom on the third floor to learn who had been selected as Intel semifinalists. The media had been alerted, and juniors like Alice also attended. ''I felt nervous for the people who were there,'' she recalled, ''and I was sitting there thinking: Oh, God, this is going to be me next year. Who wants to find out in front of all these people?''</p>
        <p>It was a great day for Midwood, with 13 semifinalists in all -- 11 from the science research program and 2 from the school's social science program. That total tied a school in Bethesda, Md., for tops in the nation. But three out of four research students did not make the cut, and some of the teachers took it harder than the kids.</p>
        <p>That thought came to mind when I spoke to Lauren, who squeezed in an appointment with me between her daily stint at the yearbook office, where she is head photographer, and a meeting of the prom planning committee. She wore a copper-colored V-neck sweater and tight black pants and fairly bristled with energy. For her Intel project, Lauren, 18, worked in the Rockefeller University laboratory of A. James Hudspeth, searching for a gene that creates tiny hairs in certain cells of the inner ear, allowing an animal (the bullfrog, in her case) to detect sound. She worked in the lab seven days a week for one summer and four or five days a week during the school year. But the Intel deadline arrived before Lauren had found the gene she was looking for. (A crushing paradox about the Intel competition is that some of the most ambitious and interesting projects are in effect penalized because they can't be completed in time.)</p>
        <p>''I was down to five or seven genes,'' she said. ''So it was very frustrating.'' Not that she didn't have a few other things to divert her. In addition to her many extracurricular activities -- being director of Midwood's Black Heritage Alliance Show and an officer in the student government -- every afternoon, after getting up at 5 a.m., attending classes and then putting in her time at the Rockefeller lab, she would head over to N.B.A. headquarters in Midtown, where she worked (sometimes as late as 10 p.m.) in human resources for the Women's N.B.A. And then she would transfer four times on the subway ride back to her home in the Windsor Terrace section of Brooklyn. When I casually asked if she had a boyfriend, she practically shouted, ''Does it sound like I have time for a boyfriend?''</p>
        <p>She, too, was sitting in the room when the Intel semifinalists were announced, and she ended up having to console her teachers. ''All of my advisers were very surprised,'' she recalled. ''Miss Nicastri was apologizing to me. She was saying, 'I'm so sorry, you should have won, I'm so sorry.' And I'm saying: 'Miss Nicastri, it's not your fault. It's O.K., it's O.K.'''</p>
        <p>Failure happens to the best of them. One day in mid-May, Eugene Simuni returned to Midwood after having spent the previous week at the International Science and Engineering Fair in Detroit. He was Midwood's star science student this year; he had already won $10,000 in cash as the grand prize winner in New York City's annual science fair and $25,000 in scholarship money as the fifth place finisher overall in the Intel Science Talent Search, which is considered the most rigorous science competition. He had been accepted at Harvard, M.I.T. and just about every other place he had applied.</p>
        <p>''So what'd you win?'' somebody asked when he walked into Room 256.</p>
        <p>''I got a T-shirt,'' he laughed. He did merit an honorable mention in the biochemistry competition. (Emmanuelle finished third in microbiology.) The consensus at Midwood was that the judges at the Detroit fair simply did not understand Eugene's project.</p>
        <p>'Welcome to New York, Eugene'</p>
        <p>Alice has her pugnacious moments, and they often surface during a long-running friendly disagreement she has with Eugene, a senior in her Spanish class. Eugene spent much of April wrestling with the enviable problem of deciding whether to attend Harvard or M.I.T. (Harvard won out.) But for the time being, he doesn't plan on pursuing a career in science. ''Eugene wants to make money,'' Alice told me one day, confiding this in a way that made it clear she considered it a prodigious waste of intellectual talent.</p>
        <p>''I don't see my career as a scientist,'' Eugene confirmed. ''Now I'm thinking about working in the technology field, but not as a scientist. More as an administrator. My personal feeling about money is, it's not the most important thing in life -- you should love what you're doing. But it's still important!'' A year ago he would have been inclined to pursue a career related to computers. ''Now, because I've been doing so much biochemistry, I'm more interested in biotechnology. So this choice is not easy.''</p>
        <p>Born in St. Petersburg, Eugene attended a special mathematics and science academy in Russia. In December 1997, when he first arrived at Midwood, Eugene would sit alone in the cafeteria, barely able to speak English yet resolutely determined not to be fazed by the experience. ''I couldn't say I was too much shocked,'' he said. He has a cheerfully phlegmatic personality, quick to laugh when he is teased but serenely unruffled by the experience of learning his chops as an American teenager in the crucible of an inner-city public high school. ''I wasn't shocked by anything. I realized that that would be the case, so I didn't feel especially bad when I sat alone in the cafeteria.''</p>
        <p>As far as I could determine, the only things that left Eugene even moderately puzzled about life in America were episodes of ''Seinfeld'' and how to operate the mimeograph machine in Room 256. One morning when he was standing by the machine, Emmanuelle, Midwood's other Intel finalist this year, came in. ''Did you get your check yet?'' she asked, referring to the $1,000 each semifinalist received. ''I got it yesterday,'' Eugene said.</p>
        <p>''How come you always get your money before me?'' she demanded. Eugene shrugged and smiled. ''I already know what I'm going to buy with mine,'' she continued. I immediately thought of a stereo, a bushel of CD's, clothes. ''Stock,'' she announced confidently. And she knew exactly which biotech company she was going to invest in.</p>
        <p>'If You Make Gazillions of Dollars. . . .'</p>
        <p>It wasn't just that they invested in stocks and won six-figure scholarships. It was the level of the research they conducted that frankly stunned me. As a high school student in the 1960's, I knew I didn't have the right stuff for the science-fair circuit from my very first (and only) project, which was based on the profoundly misguided idea that water pollution might actually benefit the health of animals. Almost everything associated with this benighted project was wrong, including the assurances I gave my family that frogs could not possibly escape from an uncovered laundry tub in the basement.</p>
        <p>The Intel students don't do science projects -- they do science, period, often working at the frontiers of knowledge and sometimes under intense competitive pressures. Eugene, working at Rockefeller University with Ethan Marin, used computerized data on the three-dimensional atomic structure of two proteins (known as G proteins) to compare the way they relayed a biological signal inside cells. He showed that the structure of one of these proteins differed in a way that could explain why it acts in a more delayed fashion in the rod cells of the eyes (and thus affects vision) but not in other cells of the body. Emmanuelle, working with a biologist at New York University Medical Center named Jayne Raper, identified a portal-like molecule on the surface of trypanosomes, the family of microbes responsible for sleeping sickness in Africa and a disease in cattle. This ''scavenger'' molecule allows the parasites to feed on cholesterol in the bloodstream of humans and animals, and thus the research suggests possible strategies for developing medicines that would block the parasites' ability to feed. Emmanuelle doesn't even have a driver's license yet, but, Raper said in an interview, ''she will get her name on a scientific paper.''</p>
        <p>The Top 40 Intel finalists, including Eugene and Emmanuelle, converged on Washington last March for the mother of all high school science fairs, the Science Talent Search, which was originally conceived by an advertising and public relations executive at Westinghouse in 1942. The students stayed for six nights at the elegant Mayflower Hotel, set up their little booths to explain their projects to public visitors at the National Academy of Sciences and endured several grueling days of questioning by a panel of judges. ''We called the Massachusetts Room, where three of the judges were, the 'Massacre Room,''' Emmanuelle explained later. The Top 10 finishers were announced at an annual black-tie awards banquet.</p>
        <p>The contest has always been exceptionally prestigious, but it has the added aura now of New Economy money. The winner of the top prize this year, Viviana Risca, of Paul D. Schreiber High School in Port Washington, on Long Island, went home with a $100,000 scholarship, part of the $1.25 million in prize money provided by Intel. A representative of a major pharmaceutical company circulated through the crowd of finalists, practically promising summer internships on the spot. There were lots of stock market jokes.</p>
        <p>I don't think the sea change in the way the world views these kids became truly apparent to me, however, until two weeks later when I accompanied the Midwood contingent to a reception at the New York City Board of Education honoring all the city's Intel finalists and semifinalists. ''This has a special meaning for me,'' said Harold O. Levy, then interim chancellor, in a ruefully witty, been-there-done-that riff, ''especially as a Bronx High School of Science student who did not get what was called, in those days, a Westinghouse. But I tried.'' As an endless stream of board members, educational officials and other functionaries took the podium, I couldn't help thinking of something Touger mentioned several days earlier: ''I tell the kids that if they're lucky enough to win, I will take full credit, and Mr. Shapiro will take full credit, and the principal and the district superintendent will take credit, and the Board of Ed and the borough president will take credit, and their parents will take credit. And whatever is left over is theirs.''</p>
        <p>But it was the eleemosynary pitch by Judith A. Rizzo, the deputy chancellor for instruction, that truly signaled the fact that nerds now rule: she already had her hand out. She implored the students to remember that they had been the product of a public school education. ''If you start a company and make gazillions of dollars,'' she said hopefully, ''maybe you can buy a few computers for the schools.'' Where once it was assumed that they would ''do well'' in the traditional academic sense, the new economy has made clear that they will most likely do well -- fabulously well, in some cases -- in the financial sense, too, and it's never too soon to get your hand out.</p>
        <p>'We Expect to See You Win a Nobel Prize'</p>
        <p>For a good part of April and May, one Midwood student after another walked into Room 256 with news of intellectual approbation -- and financial reward. Amber Iqbal, a petite girl from Pakistan, stopped by to report that she was being honored by the Society of Microbiology for her project. The American Academy of Neurology faxed a letter saying they were flying Lawrence Fung, the son of a Chinese immigrant truck driver, out to San Diego as one of three high school students in the country to collect a $1,000 award. And Ilya Sherman, one of the Russian kids, walked in with the news one day that he had received a college scholarship from Chase Manhattan Bank worth more than $100,000.</p>
        <p>Midwood's 13 Intel semifinalists also took a victory lap through the city. While the seniors posed for pictures on the steps of City Hall, savoring Peter F. Vallone's parting words at a City Council reception (''We expect to see you win a Nobel Prize one of these days,'' he said), the juniors at that very moment were schlepping to labs all over Brooklyn and Manhattan, facing a hot summer of 18-hour days, hopeful that they, too, would enjoy a similar victory tour in the spring of 2001. At about 4 on an afternoon not long after the City Hall celebration, Alice sat in front of a computer in a large high-ceilinged lab at Rockefeller University, the indirect light of a glorious afternoon spilling in through the windows. The scene had an air of monastic serenity -- not least because the most recent personal crisis seemed to have passed. Alice's mother assured her that she wouldn't move until Alice finished up at Midwood.</p>
        <p>As it turns out, the lab was in a scientific race on a very competitive project, and she was hardly a teenage bottle-washer. They needed her! Constantine Pavlides, the lab chief, began to explain to me that they were looking at the activity of a certain ''immediate-early gene'' called zif-268, which alters synaptic architecture and in so doing ''cements'' what has been learned into permanent memory. Suddenly he stopped himself short and laughed nervously. ''I'm not sure how much I should tell you,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In the next room, Alice sat at a computer plotting some preliminary data under the tutelage of Sidarta Ribeiro, a Brazilian graduate student. The software automatically converted the activity of the gene they were studying, in dreaming and wakeful animals, into side-by-side columns. The results were preliminary, but nonetheless promising. ''We have a long way to go,'' Ribeiro said carefully. ''But it's very . . . auspicious. Very interesting. We're going to pursue this.'' He got out a calendar and laid out a crash program to confirm the results, which would require an intense, coordinated plan of experimentation every day over the ensuing four weeks.</p>
        <p>Several other scientists stopped by to stare at the data on the computer screen. ''It's a nice result,'' one said. ''A cool result,'' another said. A look of sudden, unexpected rapture briefly flickered across Alice's face, as if she had just discovered an extraordinarily interesting way to be cool. ''I'm so lucky to be here,'' she whispered, and then went back to the numbers on the screen.</p>
