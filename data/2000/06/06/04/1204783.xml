        <p>THE year was 1991. Alberto Fujimori was Peru's newly elected president, and diplomats were rejoicing that every government in Latin America except Cuba's was now democratically elected. So President Fujimori joined the leaders of Peru's four Andean neighbors in proposing a radical plan: the Organization of American States would require all 34 member states to sever diplomatic relations with any government that took power unconstitutionally.</p>
        <p>Nine years later, Mr. Fujimori must be happy his plan was never adopted. This week, the Organization of American States is to consider how to punish Mr. Fujimori for claiming a third five-year term after an election last Sunday that was tainted by dirty tricks and re-interpretation of the constitution, which limits Peru's presidents to two terms. His opponent, Alejandro Toledo, wound up boycotting the vote.</p>
        <p>Still, Peru is probably safe from any drastic measures, in large part because the Clinton Administration is reluctant to punish a strong ally in the war against drugs and because Peru is not alone among its peers in  slipping back into old authoritarian patterns.</p>
        <p>The current president of Ecuador, a civilian, came to power in January by military coup. The elected president of Venezuela is a former military coup leader who has made all-out war on the Congress and the courts. Paraguay's civilian government is teetering.</p>
        <p>Does this turn of events mean the man on horseback is coming back in Latin America? Or is it that Latin America never completely unsaddled him?</p>
        <p>In fact, authoritarianism and democracy have long coexisted in Latin America, and a swing toward elections has never meant autocracy is dead. A pattern of generals replacing civilian presidents only to be replaced again by generals has been the rule from Panama to Argentina for the better part of a century. A variant on the theme, in places like Peru and Mexico, is a civilian leader who is elected and then rules by fiat, fraud or manipulation of the courts and congress.</p>
        <p>''The box on the outside is labeled a democracy,'' said Piero Gleijeses, a professor of Latin American studies at Johns Hopkins University, ''but inside you have an authoritarian system.'' A history of oligarchy, class division and racial conflict makes it hard to establish the social compacts on which liberal democracy is most often built.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fujimori is not so much a model of a new kind of authoritarianism as an exemplar of something older.  ''Our military regimes were never that tough and our elected governments were never that democratic,'' said Carlos Tapia, a former Peruvian congressman and social critic. ''Our coups were never initiated by the military alone. There was always a group of civilians ready to manipulate the military to jump in.''</p>
        <p>The model for the civilian strongman in Peru goes back at least to the 1919 election of Augusto B. Leguia, a businessman with a taste for top hats and thoroughbred horses, who served until a coup upended his rule in 1930. Like Mr. Fujimori, Mr. Leguia was a master builder of roads and ports who eagerly sought foreign investment. He also displayed little compunction about breaking democratic rules. He ordered the army to shut down the Congress, he closed down newspapers that opposed him, and his race horses had remarkable success at the track as soon as he took office.</p>
        <p>As for governing Peru, neither the military nor the civilian strongmen have a stellar record. Most recently, the military regimes that ruled from 1968 to 1980 pushed through a radical land reform. But it ultimately failed, leading to a slump in agriculture and a chaotic peasant migration to the cities that created shantytowns that are still spreading. It did little for public confidence in military efficiency.</p>
        <p>When civilians returned to power in 1980 the people were overjoyed. But the next 10 years were marked by hyperinflation, massive corruption and the eruption of terrorist violence. This ultimately discredited all the traditional political parties, leaving the public in despair about their hopes for order.</p>
        <p>Finally the people turned to Mr. Fujimori, the ultimate outsider, a son of Japanese immigrants who belonged to no party and promised a clean break with the past. His popularity soared when he disbanded the Supreme Court and Congress in 1992, claiming that their corrupt ways were blocking his battle against terrorists including the Shining Path group -- whose leaders he then captured. In 1995, he won re-election in a landslide; it amounted to a democratic affirmation of authoritarianism and left advocates of democracy worried.</p>
        <p>''A full democracy means more than elections,'' noted Carlos Ivan Degregori, an anthropologist at the Institute of Peruvian Studies. ''It requires sturdy institutions: strong political parties, an independent judiciary and a Congress willing to vote against the executive branch.'' Most often, he said, ''the boundary between democracy and authoritarianism is not so clear.''</p>
        <p>This is particularly true in the region's poorest countries, like neighboring Bolivia, where the democratically elected president is a former military dictator. But it is also true in Latin America's more economically and politically developed countries.</p>
        <p>Chile is still governed under a constitution that was written when Augusto Pinochet was dictator; it gives the military independent powers over selecting its commanders and even senators. The new governor of Buenos Aires province in Argentina, when faced with a rising crime problem, selected as his police chief a former army colonel who had led a 1987 uprising to block trials against former junta leaders.</p>
        <p>''Whichever way the pendulum swings,'' said Felipe Noguera, an Argentine political consultant, ''it's not like the people overnight become perfect democrats and the next day become supporters of coups. People in this region are aware of both the weaknesses of democracy and the perils of authoritarian rule.''</p>
        <p>That may explain why in the days leading up to last Sunday's election, opinion polls showed that even though a majority of Peruvians said they thought the election process was tainted, they would vote for Mr. Fujimori.</p>
