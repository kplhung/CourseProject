        <p>ON a recent spring afternoon, Rob Yasinsac crept like a cat burglar through brambles toward a ruined mansion, its windows boarded up, its rotting shutters overgrown with vines. ''It's been abandoned for 15 years, possibly longer,'' he said warily, glancing around to make sure no one was watching.</p>
        <p>No, this is not a sequel to the ''Blair Witch Project.'' At 22, Mr. Yasinsac, a Tarrytown native, has made it his personal cause to document the last of the lower Hudson Valley's ruins and abandoned buildings, which are rapidly falling prey to bulldozers as Westchester County's housing boom continues.</p>
        <p>He first fell in love with ruins five years ago while hiking along the Old Croton Aqueduct, which runs from Yonkers to the village of Croton-on-Hudson, and along which ruins of old carriage houses and gardens can still be glimpsed through the trees.</p>
        <p>Using old maps and books as his guides, he extended his range from Tarrytown, where he grew up and lives today, to the rest of the lower Hudson Valley, which is littered with abandoned residential and industrial sites. Last year he created a Web site devoted to the area's ruins and abandoned buildings, including many of the photographs he has taken of them. (The address is http://members.xoom.com/yazmcboo/ links.html.)</p>
        <p>One particular ruin is on the grounds of the Gracemere Estate in Tarrytown, which was owned by the clothing magnate Henry King Browning from 1910 to 1930. He built it for his daughter Adelaide, who lived there with her husband, Homer Stewart Green, who was mayor of Tarrytown from 1933 to 1937. Once an elegant three-story home, the house is now too far gone for renovation. It is now owned by the Unification Church, which said through a spokesman that it has no plans for renovation.</p>
        <p>Pushing open a rotting wood door, Mr. Yasinsac led a visitor inside for a look. The floor was littered with junk: cracked sinks and toilets, rusted pipes and radiators, insulation, a stack of doors. An elegant molding along the ceiling testifies to the house's opulent past. Upstairs in one of the bedrooms -- there must have been close to a dozen at one time -- there is a chalk outline of a human figure on the wall, scored with bullet holes. Wind rattles the old timbers, and bird songs trill through the open doors.</p>
        <p>''I've actually been on stairs far weaker than these,'' Mr. Yasinsac said as he crept down the back stairs, in a futile effort to reassure his guest. In the basement is a rusted furnace and a baby's crib, and a yellowed newspaper left on a table as though it were yesterday's, dated April 2, 1973.</p>
        <p>With his gaunt features, beard and ponytail, Mr. Yasinsac himself resembles a ghost from the past. It seems appropriate that he works at the Philipsburg Manor in Sleepy Hollow as an interpreter in period garb, guiding visitors through the 17th-century mansion and mill.</p>
        <p>A graduate of SUNY Oswego, Mr. Yasinsac has become a kind of walking encyclopedia of the area's ruins. Many of them are well-known: there is Bannerman's Castle, the romantic old Scottish-style castle on Pollepel Island in the Hudson, built early in the 20th century and abandoned since the 1950's. There is Wyndcliffe in Rhinebeck, a Norman-style brick mansion built in 1853. There are the ruins of the Spratt House in Tarrytown, which was once used as a setting for the television series ''Dark Shadows.''</p>
        <p>There are several abandoned industrial sites, like the old Anaconda plant on the waterfront in Hastings-on-Hudson, and the vast Consolidated Edison power station at Glenwood in Yonkers.</p>
        <p>Yet the community of ruins lovers is surprisingly small. There is only one other Web site devoted to Hudson Valley ruins (www.georgetown.edu/users/rinaldit/ hvruins.htm). It is run by Mr. Yasinsac's friend Tom Rinaldi, a student at Georgetown University who focuses on the upper Hudson Valley, not Westchester.</p>
        <p>There are local historical societies, and there are groups devoted to particular ruins, like the Bannerman's Castle Trust or the Wilderstein Trust, which manages the Wilderstein estate in Rhinebeck. But there is no umbrella group to speak out for the lesser-known ruins when they are threatened by development.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yasinsac can recite several losses he has witnessed in the last few years: the Old Immaculate Conception Church in Irvington, torn down in early 1996; the John Terry Carriage House in Tarrytown, built in 1859 and torn down by Kraft Foods, the owner of the property, in 1995; and the old 1911 Tarrytown Hospital, demolished in 1998.</p>
        <p>Other sites are likely to disappear soon, and that, Mr. Yasinsac said, is his real motive for documenting the ruins he loves. Perhaps the greatest of these threatened buildings is Briarcliff Lodge, which he calls the Hudson Valley ruin of all Hudson Valley ruins.</p>
        <p>On a hill overlooking the Hudson, Briarcliff Lodge is a vast, fake-medieval-style structure, which was built as a 225-room resort at the turn of the 20th century. Most recently it housed the main building of Kings College, which folded in 1994, and since then it has been owned by Blue Lake Properties, which has allowed it to go to seed.</p>
        <p>From the outside, the lodge looks like a campus in the aftermath of a sudden epidemic. Pamphlets advertising student activity groups and alumni meetings drift in the breeze on the empty walkways. A few battered bikes are still locked to stands.</p>
        <p>The ground-floor windows are boarded up. But one of them is open, and since there are no signs warning against trespassing, Mr. Yasinsac was happy to lead a guest in for a look. He has floor plans for the entire building, he added.</p>
        <p>Inside, the rooms are stripped bare, paint peeling from walls and the brown carpeting littered with plaster dust. A short walk through darkened rooms leads to the main hall and the president's office, which has oak doors 15 feet high. The wind whistles and bangs, creating a ghostly feeling. In the back are the empty metal stacks of the library, and behind them the windows are wide open.</p>
        <p>''You've got to wonder if they didn't intend to leave the windows open,'' Mr. Yasinsac said, ''so that when rain gets in they can say it's going to cost too much to restore, we've got to tear it down.''</p>
        <p>It is easy to see why developers want the site. There are spectacular views of the Hudson for miles in either direction.</p>
