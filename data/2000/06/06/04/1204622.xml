        <p>Carl Dranoff has always prided himself on looking one step over the horizon.</p>
        <p>''Frankly, though, if you are not there just before the beginning in my business, you are too late.'' said Mr. Dranoff, whose business is the conversion of buildings into luxury apartments.</p>
        <p>Now the horizon Mr. Dranoff is looking over is here in Camden, the poorest city in New Jersey and perhaps in the nation -- and luxury apartments may be a very hard sell in a city without a movie theater or even a large supermarket, particularly situated just blocks from two prisons.</p>
        <p>The building he has cast his eyes on is familiarly known as the Nipper building, the last vestige of the great Radio Corporation of America complex that thrived along the banks of the Delaware here in the first half of the 20th century. If all goes according to plan -- a plan that will cost an estimated $50 million -- in 18 months Mr. Dranoff will have built 500 upscale loft-style one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments both there and in an adjacent building.</p>
        <p>''The first Victrolas were built there,'' said Thomas Roberts, executive director of the Camden Redevelopment Authority, which is negotiating with Mr. Dranoff on the property. ''Caruso recorded opera there. Many jazz singers recorded there as well. It is a very historic place.''</p>
        <p>Many of the buildings within the complex were abandoned and torn down over the last decade, but the Redevelopment Agency, which now owns the building, saved the Nipper building mostly out of public sentiment. The top of the circa 1916 six-story brick tower is embellished on four sides by stained-glass windows depicting the dog Nipper listening to an old Victrola, which with the slogan ''His masters voice,'' was the symbol for RCA.</p>
        <p>The eventual demise of the RCA complex mirrored that of Camden itself. RCA's operations -- which at one time housed laboratories for major developments in television and computers -- were eventually sold to General Electric, which in turn left.</p>
        <p>As for the 52-year-old Mr. Dranoff, who grew up in Northeast Philadelphia, he made his name a generation ago with his company, Historic Landmarks for Living, converting abandoned or underutilized old buildings near Philadelphia's Independence National Historical Park into upscale apartments and condominiums.</p>
        <p>''When I started in what became Old City, it was just a bunch of ramshackle, blighted buildings and no one would live there,'' Mr. Dranoff said proudly. ''Now, 20 years later, it has clubs and art galleries and luxury condos and fancy restaurants, and virtually every building has been spoken for.''</p>
        <p>Then there is Camden. This city, never a luxury kind of place even in the best of times, lost nearly all its manufacturing and wholesaling base, which until the 1970's included such industries as New York Shipbuilding, Esterbrook Pen, J. B. Van Sciver furniture and Campbell's soup. Campbell's still keeps an office in Camden, though not its manufacturing complex.</p>
        <p>Yet the demolition of industrial buildings along the Delaware has had some upsides as well. The prisons, which were disdained elsewhere, brought jobs into the city. There are also more substantial and welcome projects that came in the 1990's -- the Thomas Kean State Aquarium, the Ulysses Wiggins riverfront park and the E-Center, an entertainment complex south of the Wiggins Park -- that have created employment and drawn suburbanites from the more affluent suburbs.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Dranoff sees a far greater future for Camden.</p>
        <p>''I knew things were brewing in Camden,'' he said. ''The aquarium was doing an expansion. Kravco was doing something with a supermarket and retail. A major tourist attraction in the Battleship New Jersey was coming. A minor-league baseball stadium was planned. Light rail was coming in.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Roberts of the Redevelopment Agency and Thomas Corcoran of the nonprofit Coopers Ferry Development Association, which is leading the planning for Camden's waterfront, came to last year's grand opening of Mr. Dranoff's last big project, the conversion of a warehouse along the Schuylkill in Philadelphia into 152 luxury apartments.</p>
        <p>''After looking around, Mr. Corcoran chatted with me,'' Mr. Dranoff said. ''He saw the old industrial building we were in and saw an analogy to the Nipper building. Eventually, my staff and I went over there and got excited about the prospects.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dranoff claims he is undeterred by Camden's dilapidated state.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to use hyperbole here, but Old City wasn't an inspiring site when we went in there 20 years ago,'' said Mr. Dranoff. ''And I could use another analogy -- the riverfront in North Jersey, with Jersey City and Hoboken and the like. There had been no imagination there until 10 years ago and now its the hottest market in that area.</p>
        <p>''People don't realize the magnitude of what is going on in Camden,'' said Mr. Dranoff. He noted that the light rail system on the old Conrail line coming from Trenton and connecting to the Port Authority train line to Philadelphia and Camden County suburbs is scheduled for operation within two years -- just as his project will be finishing -- with a station behind the Nipper building. A tram from the Philadelphia waterfront is also expected to be operating by then.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dranoff sees his potential renters as young professionals in their 20's and 30's, many with jobs in Philadelphia and even the Camden suburbs. The Nipper building project will have plenty of parking, some retail on the first level, a gym and a 24-hour concierge. Rents are expected to be below comparable housing just a stone's throw away in Philadelphia, where a luxury one-bedroom apartment can cost about $1,000 a month.</p>
        <p>''And we will have a better view,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roberts, for one, is ecstatic about Mr. Dranoff's enthusiasm.</p>
        <p>''This is just the kind of thing we need in Camden,'' he said. ''So far, everything has been entertainment or commercial in our waterfront development. People come for a couple of hours and then do the rest of their spending elsewhere. We need to rebuild the permanent community. To get someone like Mr. Dranoff, who has built thousands of units successfully, well, that is a real boost.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dranoff said he saw no real problems with the project. He is in predevelopment planning now, drafting architectural designs and looking toward what he called standard removal of asbestos and lead paint, the only hazardous material discovered on the site so far. He said he saw no problem getting the $50 million in private financing.</p>
        <p>''People right now don't understand the magnitude of the development on Camden's waterfront,'' said Mr. Dranoff. ''I feel the tram, something dramatic, will open their eyes, just like the water taxis connecting the Jersey Hudson waterfront to Lower Manhattan did. The time for Camden's renaissance is at hand. You have to be there at the beginning and have the vision that things will revive.''</p>
