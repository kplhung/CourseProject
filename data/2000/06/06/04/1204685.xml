        <p>ONE of Camille Melika Banks's favorite questions for strangers is, ''Do I look like a teacher?'' Most people answer no.</p>
        <p>''Cami is not like a schoolmarm,'' said Kamili Bell, a tax lawyer and friend. ''She doesn't have an apple on her desk. Cami might show up in her classroom with a low-cut black T-shirt, a Lycra skirt and a nice tall heel, toes painted.''</p>

        <p>ONE of Camille Melika Banks's favorite questions for strangers is, ''Do I look like a teacher?'' Most people answer no.</p>
        <p>''Cami is not like a schoolmarm,'' said Kamili Bell, a tax lawyer and friend. ''She doesn't have an apple on her desk. Cami might show up in her classroom with a low-cut black T-shirt, a Lycra skirt and a nice tall heel, toes painted.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Banks, known as Cami, is 29 and an English teacher at the Anne M. Dorner Middle School in Ossining, N.Y. She is known for being gutsy and irreverent, and for inspiring her students to be independent thinkers and to excel without becoming nerds.</p>
        <p>Seven years ago she met Malcolm Lee, now 30, who is a screenwriter and director and a member of the Brooklyn-based Lee clan of actors, writers, musicians and filmmakers (Spike Lee is a cousin). They were introduced at the birthday party of a mutual friend. ''I had a Bailey's Irish Cream in one hand and an amaretto sour in the other,'' she remembered. ''Malcolm is a very stoic and reserved and conservative guy. He said to me, 'Do you really need two drinks?' And I said, 'As a matter of fact, I do, because sometimes I feel smooth and other times I feel tangy.' ''</p>
        <p>It did not seem likely at the time that they could fall in love, partly because they are so different. He's cautious and so responsible that he is always the designated driver among his group of friends. She doesn't flinch while making illegal U-turns, she said, or hesitate to sob dramatically when caught by a police officer.</p>
        <p>And they had a geographical problem. She lived in Westchester and was terrified of Brooklyn; he lived in Brooklyn and hated the suburbs. She remembered that the first time she drove him over the Tappan Zee Bridge (to go shopping at an outlet mall), he reacted like a kidnapping victim, screaming, ''Where are you taking me?''</p>
        <p>In fact, for the first few months of their courtship, they acted like a bicoastal couple. They talked on the phone almost every day, wrote letters to each other, but rarely got together in person.</p>
        <p>Gradually, phone call by phone call, letter by letter, Mr. Lee said he began to fall in love with Ms. Banks. But she really won his heart when they started attending Knicks games together (both are huge basketball fans). ''At times, we'd be kissing and she'd turn away to see the score,'' he remembered. ''That made me love her even more.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''She's funny and she gives me space. Besides loving sports, space is No. 2 on my list. She's very independent.''</p>
        <p>In Mr. Lee's recent film, ''The Best Man,'' a group of African-American college friends get together for a wedding. The film is full of wry lines about love, marriage and missed romantic opportunities. As one character says to another, ''She was the best girlfriend you never had.''</p>
        <p>Like the bride and bridegroom in the film, Ms. Banks and Mr. Lee describe themselves as each other's angels as well as best friends. When he proposed a year ago, while they were on vacation in Florida, she was speechless, perhaps for the first time. ''She didn't say anything at first,'' he recalled. ''And so I said, 'If you say no, you're not getting the ring!' '' At that point she screamed ''yes,'' and they celebrated by driving along the coast in a convertible sports car. (He cautiously manned the wheel while she stared at the diamond.)</p>
        <p>On May 27, about 175 guests gathered for their wedding at the Chart House restaurant overlooking the Hudson River in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y. Their wedding was much simpler and down-to-earth than the one in the movie, but the couple's homemade vows mirrored the film's best lines. ''I do not pledge you my heart,'' the bridegroom told the bride. ''Because you already have it. And you cannot give it back.''</p>
        <p>After the ceremony, several friends sat down to analyze the relationship. ''He lays down the laws,'' Carol Passariello said.</p>
        <p>''And she breaks them, lovingly,'' Andrea J. Rogers said.</p>
