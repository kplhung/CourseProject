        <p>Two projects have been announced to help deal with mysterious lobster deaths that have decimated Long Island Sound's $100 million-a-year lobster industry.</p>
        <p>A research facility is to be set up at the Vanderbilt Museum boathouse in Centerport with $280,000 from FLAG Telecom, which is seeking approval by Huntington Town to install a trans-Atlantic fiber-optic cable at Crab Meadow Beach in Northport.</p>
        <p>And legislation creating a marine disease and pathology consortium at the State University at Stony Brook was signed into law last month by Gov. George E. Pataki.</p>
        <p>The consortium consists of the university, Long Island University and the New York State Sea Grant Institute, a joint program of Cornell University and the State University of New York.</p>
        <p>The consortium is to be established with $500,000 from SUNY and another $500,000 from the State Department of Environmental Conservation, according to Marvin Geller, dean of the Marine Sciences Research Center at the State University at Stony Brook.</p>
        <p>''The money will enable the consortium to set up research at the university to understand and try to diagnose marine diseases and their relationship to environmental factors,'' he said, noting that it is expected to take a year to get the project up and running.</p>
        <p>The initiative at the Vanderbilt Museum, which will work in partnership with Cornell Cooperative Extension, was developed by two Huntington Town Council members, Steve Israel and Mark Cuthbertson.</p>
        <p>It calls for the hiring of a senior scientist and two field workers to develop a plan to increase the lobster population in Long Island Sound and to monitor and research the lobster recovery.</p>
