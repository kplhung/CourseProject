        <p>Nevada is a state in which voters are always given an extra choice on the ballot: ''None of These Candidates.'' And ''None'' has been known to finish first in some minor races.</p>
        <p>It follows, then, that Nevada politics can sometimes be unpredictable and filled with surprises. Consider:</p>
        <p>In last weekend's Republican State Convention in Carson City, the delegates passed resolutions opposing legalized marijuana, same-sex marriages and openly gay people serving in the military.</p>
        <p>No surprises there. Then the delegates passed a resolution opposing United States membership in the United Nations and calling for the United Nations and its staff to be moved off American soil.</p>
        <p>That raised an eyebrow or two.</p>
        <p>But the real eye-opener came when the delegates, after noisy debate, voted 166 to 149 to kill a resolution declaring that the party opposed all abortions.</p>
        <p>With many leading Nevada Republicans opposed to abortion, the expectation going into the convention was that the anti-abortion resolution, having already made it through committee, would be adopted.</p>
        <p>Opponents of the resolution carried the day by contending that the party would do better in the fall elections if it took no position on abortion and allowed individual candidates to express their individual views. Many of those delegates wore buttons warning: ''G.O.P. Pothole Ahead.''</p>
