        <p>Four-year-old Matan Berner-Kadish, the center of a swirling debate about alternative families, is not at all conflicted about his identity. He knows he is a Power Ranger, fiercer than any Ninja warrior by far.</p>
        <p>Towheaded with floppy bangs, Matan was completely nonplused by the photographs of his parents on the front page of Israeli newspapers earlier this week.. ''Mommy,'' he said, pointing to Nicole Berner-Kadish, ''and Eema,'' he added, using the Hebrew word for mommy and pointing to Ruti Berner-Kadish.</p>
        <p>For Matan, there has never been any question. He has always had two mothers, or, to be precise, one mom who is American-born and speaks to him in English and one eema who is Israeli-born and speaks to him in Hebrew.</p>
        <p>But it was not until Monday that the state of Israel accepted that basic fact of his existence, with a watershed court ruling that drew howls of outrage -- but not much more -- from the religious right.</p>
        <p>The Israeli High Court ordered the government to register Nicole Berner-Kadish, an American-Israeli who adopted Matan in California, as his second mother and to list him on her national identity card. Matan -- whose name means ''gift'' -- was conceived and planned as both women's child. But after Ruti Berner-Kadish, who was artificially inseminated, gave birth to him, Israel, unlike California, refused to recognize Nicole's parental rights.</p>
        <p>A classic Israeli idiom, which means to proclaim that there's no one like mom, says, ''There is only one mother.'' And the government felt that the catch phrase should be taken literally: it was biologically impossible, the government insisted, for anyone to have more than one.</p>
        <p>The two women, who hold dual nationality, expected this. But as children of the 1960's who both spent their formative years in California, and many of them in Berkeley, they were raised to do battle for their rights and everybody else's.</p>
        <p>Nicole, 35, a lawyer, and Ruti, 36, an academic, say they felt well positioned to charge ahead on an issue that makes many Israelis squeamish. Fresh-faced, well-scrubbed professionals, they put people at ease because they themselves are at ease, even in religious, conservative Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>''We're what's known as white-picket-fence lesbians, or whatever the Israeli equivalent would be,'' Nicole Berner-Kadish said. ''We're like perfect poster children for alternative families.''</p>
        <p>Represented by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, they petitioned the High Court two years ago. While their case was pending, Nicole Berner-Kadish was artificially inseminated and gave birth in Israel to the couple's second son, Naveh. He is the next legal battle.</p>
        <p>In a society that spent many decades trying to forge a collective identity, individual variants were long considered obstacles on the path to nation-building. Israel promoted conformity as a Zionist ideal.</p>
        <p>Until 1988, the state outlawed homosexual acts in its criminal code, and gay life was extremely closeted. Even the gay and lesbian advocacy group had a euphemistic name: the Association for Personal Rights. Gay and lesbian bars moved furtively from one location to another.</p>
        <p>In the 1990's, gays and lesbians began to assert themselves and nurture a visible culture. It is now sufficiently developed for Tel Aviv to have issued a map of the city's gay meeting places last week.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the gay and lesbian communities also made significant civil rights' advances. Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation was outlawed and a couple of major court cases -- against El Al, the state airline, and the army -- set the precedent for benefits to be awarded to gay spouses and widows.</p>
        <p>In the lesbian community, the 90's ushered in a baby boom, and every issue of a lesbian newsletter includes several ''Mazel Tovs'' to new mothers.</p>
        <p>Since it involves hospitals, schools and other public institutions, motherhood kind of forced the community out into the open, although the Berner-Kadishes say that many of their friends still speak indirectly about ''our situation.''</p>
        <p>''There's still a tremendous amount of fear about being found out,'' Ruti said. ''Here I am, totally out, and sometimes I hear a remark and. . .'' Nicole interrupted, ''You come home and burst into tears.'' ''Sometimes, I compare it to being Jewish in America,'' Ruti said. ''I think people are really polite to my face and inside, on some level, they think I have horns.''</p>
        <p>Last spring, when Matan was 3, he and a playmate were strapped into their child seats, riding in the back of the couple's car. Matan's friend suddenly said, ''Where's Matan's daddy?'' And, while Ruti held her breath, Matan answered, ''I don't have a daddy. I have an eema and a mommy. You're the one who has a daddy.''</p>
        <p>A few days later, provoked by the question, Matan asked his mother why he did not, after all, have a father. Then he asked why he did not have a sister, and why he did not have a pet. Having long anticipated the moment, his mothers launched into an speech about how there are all different kinds of families, and not long into their explanation, Matan nodded his head and asked for a fruit smoothie.</p>
        <p>In pursuing their case, the women had the powerful documentary support of a California adoption certificate. That allowed the case to be argued on technical issues, separating legal definitions from biological ones.</p>
        <p>Israeli case law says that the Interior Ministry has to register citizens as they define themselves if they can show an official document supporting what they claim -- a marriage certificate from Cyprus, for instance, to prove they are married.</p>
        <p>A three-judge panel rejected the government's argument. But the decision was a narrow one, addressing the registration alone and not the principle.</p>
        <p>Still, the dissenting judge -- the only man on the panel -- and almost everyone else saw it to have broader social implications. Judge Abd al-Rahman Zouabi said that registering Nicole Berner-Kadish as Matan's second mother would create an ''abnormal family unit.''</p>
        <p>The Berner-Kadishes had fought successfully to keep their case from being secret; the state not only listed Nicole as Jane Doe but sought to bar media coverage. And when they won on Monday, on the sixth anniversary of their unofficial wedding ceremony, they were jubilant.</p>
        <p>Gay groups called it a momentous day, but religious groups were outraged.</p>
        <p>Avraham Ravitz, a strictly Orthodox legislator, said the High Court was turning Israel into a ''Sodom and Gomorrah, in which every possible perversion is sanctioned by law.''</p>
        <p>But Emuna Elon, who is a religious, right-wing pundit, tried to calm the debate in an op-ed piece. ''This precedent-setting ruling does not turn 'Eema and Mommy' into a married couple,'' she wrote. ''But it does grant security and satisfaction to two good and loving women who have decided to be life partners and to raise children, and there isn't anything wrong with that according to Jewish law, either.''</p>
        <p>With the speed of the Israeli news cycle, Matan became part of popular culture in a day. This happened even at a time when Israel was still reeling from the quick withdrawal from Lebanon, which had been fought for by a grassroots group called the Four Mothers Movement, started by soldiers' mothers.</p>
        <p>A cartoon showed a little boy telling an Israeli soldier, ''I have two mothers!'' And the soldier said, ''I've got four!''</p>
        <p>Matan did not have a clue that he was caricatured in the newspaper. Sitting on a couch with a plastic sword in his lap, he watched ''Bambi.'' Occasionally, he and a friend jousted.</p>
        <p>''Pow,'' Matan said, thrusting his fists through the air. ''Pow, pow.''</p>
