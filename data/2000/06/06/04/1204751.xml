        <p>''I won't do cheesy to win; I won't protest when it's not necessary,'' said Amanda Clark, allowing the qualifying conjunction to begin tacking around her port side. ''But I will not let the girls think that they can beat me. I will try to keep the image of advantage.''</p>
        <p>If that means a jabbing remark or two flung into the wind as boats come close in open sea, well, Clark is 18 years old now and there are regattas in which she is the old lady fiercely determined to qualify for the big race. She has set her mind on competing in Sydney, Australia, this year, but she will have to wait until December, long after the Olympics are over.</p>
        <p>Clark is a year older, 15 pounds heavier with weight-room muscle and slightly colder-eyed than when we last met her. She was then about to embark on a downwind summer that would fill her sails and her potential to become a teenaged member of the Olympic team. But she didn't make it.</p>
        <p>At the Olympic trials for the Europe Class in San Francisco in April, she got the jitters and started poorly. She made a spectacular run from 18th place among 23 racers to finish third. Only the winner would go to the Games, and that was Courtenay Dey, who had coached Clark in a more innocent time.</p>
        <p>Last June, sitting as she was last week in the sunny, airy living room of her parents' spacious house on this summer resort island off the East End of Long Island, Clark remembered a revelatory day with Dey when ''everything clicked.''</p>
        <p>''The boat just felt so good,'' Clark said. ''I wasn't fighting the helm. The shape of the sail was right, nothing twisted, no big wrinkles, and I felt the power of the boat and I felt in control.</p>
        <p>''I was going downwind,'' Clark recalled. ''I knew my limits and I sailed the line, just how far I could push the boat without flipping over. I had it. I knew it was time to move on.''</p>
        <p>She moved from Optimists to the more competitive Europe dinghies. There was another coach. The 2000 Olympics seemed possible. The Shelter Island Yacht Club was at the heart of a campaign that would eventually raise more than $50,000. There was a Web site.</p>
        <p>The next time Courtenay Dey figured in a revelation, the older woman was leaning out of her own boat at the Olympic trials and saying, in a way that Clark found cutting and intimidating and appropriate, ''Oh, you got a little close to the mark.''</p>
        <p>Dey, who is 35, had won a bronze medal in 1996 in the Europe class. Her rivals were relieved when she entered the Olympic trials in the 470 class earlier this year. But after she finished second, she climbed back into a Europe dinghy. When Dey showed up at San Francisco in April with a new mast and sail, Clark was nervous. Many of the younger women told each other that the experienced Dey would have the added advantage of old friends among the officials who would cut her slack.</p>
        <p>''It's probably true, but it's life,'' Clark said. ''A lot of racing is psychological, and if people think you have some kind of advantage, it's better to let them keep thinking that.''</p>
        <p>Until now, Clark has been operating mostly on determination and genes. Her grandfather, Albertus (Toots) Clark, was a professional captain. Her father, Dennis, a painting contractor here and one of the few local members of the yacht club, put Amanda, her sister, Rebecca, and her brother, Greg, on his sailboat just as soon as they were big enough to be rail meat. Her mother, Ellen, who runs a recruitment agency for pharmaceutical scientists, remembers that Amanda was never afraid as she became a tireless, driven sailor.</p>
        <p>The family supported her passion, which has been expensive and time-consuming; six-hour round trips to regional training centers and regattas have become months in Europe and Asia.</p>
        <p>The dream goes on. Clark is a child in the sport, although she will begin traveling alone soon. Later this month, she will be graduated with honors from Shelter Island High School. Before she enters Connecticut College in the fall (there is a sailing team, but no athletic scholarships), she will compete in the European Championship in Spain and the Leiter Cup, in Newport, R.I., which is the qualifying event for the Youth World Championships in Sydney in December. Last year, Clark won a bronze at the Youth.</p>
        <p>''This year, I'm going to be the Courtenay, the old lady,'' Clark said. ''It'll be my last chance to compete in the Youth, and I want to win the gold. My plan for the summer is to get the fun back in sailing and to play around with what I learned at the trials. I'm preparing for 2004, too, the Athens Olympics.''</p>
        <p>She says, just a little too perkily, that she was not disappointed at missing the Olympic cut; when your biggest rival is old enough to be your mother, there is time. Besides, she still has kids to scare in her final 18-and-under regattas. She's been very aware of a 15-year-old, still raw, but with a lot of ''spunk.'' Clark was reminded of herself, and those are just the ones you need to intimidate and sail away from fast.</p>
