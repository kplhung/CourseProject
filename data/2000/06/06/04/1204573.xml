        <p>JOHN A. DeVITO JR. of Somers, who builds luxury homes, was planning to build one for his family when a classic local estate from the 1870's, Orchard Hill Farm, came on the market four years ago.

        <p>Mr. DeVito crouched over the solution and executed a nice break shot. ''This is an ageless product,'' he said of the eight-foot mahogany Brunswick pool table, newly built but in high Victorian style with fringed leather pockets and claw-and-ball legs.

        <p>JOHN A. DeVITO JR. of Somers, who builds luxury homes, was planning to build one for his family when a classic local estate from the 1870's, Orchard Hill Farm, came on the market four years ago. He and his wife, Janet, bought it, and were faced with a problem (all right, so it's a nice problem): how do you start furnishing a 54-by-26-foot living room?</p>
        <p>Mr. DeVito crouched over the solution and executed a nice break shot. ''This is an ageless product,'' he said of the eight-foot mahogany Brunswick pool table, newly built but in high Victorian style with fringed leather pockets and claw-and-ball legs. Janet DeVito chose a burgundy-colored covering -- table surfaces come in many colors besides green -- and has been furnishing that end of the living room to match the table.</p>
        <p>''A home needs to be functional, and it needs to be comfortable,'' her husband said. ''That's the difference between a house and a home.''</p>
        <p>Typically, Mr. DeVito said, people gravitate to a home's kitchen and family room, leaving the living room lonely except for formal occasions. ''What the pool table does is it makes this room really useful,'' he said, observing that his sons, 21 and 11, and his daughter, 19, are in love with it.</p>
        <p>In the booming real estate market, builders or remodelers of larger homes are finding that a full-size pool table (eight feet long, or nine feet for championship and most antique models) can have a lot of uses besides being a place to make judicious wagers (a practice that went out of style with stogies, anyway). That's especially true if, like the DeVitos, one buys a padded cover, allowing the table to serve as a buffet table (the surface may be a little high for a dining room table.)</p>
        <p>In Danbury, Ed O'Connell, the owner of Time After Time, an antique billiard table store, said that a restored table rarely spends much time on his showroom floor because the demand by homeowners is so great. He does a heavy business in Westchester and Putnam, as well as Long Island and Connecticut, installing 60 to 100 home tables a year, a growing number of them antiques.</p>
        <p>''It's like the 50's again,'' he said, ''where mom and dad are doing over the basement to keep the kids home.'' Except that the children are now baby boomers in prime earning years, and some of them are getting the toy they always wanted.</p>
        <p>''It's a good social game,'' Mr. O'Connell said, adding, ''In the 1890's pocket billiards was greater than baseball.''</p>
        <p>In fact, the ambience of billiards is now closer to that of an exclusive gentlemen's club than to the seedy haunts of people like Minnesota Fats. (Pool aficionados say that ''The Hustler,'' the 1961 Paul Newman-Jackie Gleason movie classic, simultaneously heightened pool's popularity and killed off the old-time Fast Eddies, who couldn't pull their cons in the glare of publicity.) Other more recent popularizers have been the 1986 movie ''The Color of Money'' (Paul Newman updating his hustler's role 25 years later, with Tom Cruise) and the glamorous touring female pros, like Ewa Mataya and Jeanette (the Black Widow) Lee.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Connell described a recent conversion in a South Salem home for which he supplied an antique rosewood table; the owners turned a former squash court into a poolroom. Allowing five feet on each side for the cue stick, Mr. O'Connell said the critical numbers for a pool room with an eight-foot table are about 14 by 18 feet. Lighting should throw no shadows on the table.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Connell added that he teaches billiards Saturday mornings, at the store only. ''Customers want me to go over to their house and teach, which I don't have time to do,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In Yonkers, Stephen Loria, the fourth generation of his family's V. Loria &amp; Sons billard supply store, sifted through photographs of some of his billiard installations. There was an all-pink room, with a pink table on half-moon legs. There was a fake marble table. There was enough inlay to make Louis XV reasonably happy. There was an autographed picture of Ewa Mataya and one of Cue-Ball Kelly, a legend of a different era who had no hair.</p>
        <p>The thought framed itself even before Stephen Loria said it: ''It's an adult candy store.'' A $4,400 mahogany ''Versailles'' model came with a $1,795 oak cover so it could double as a serving table. (Cues can sell from $25 into the thousands.) There were lights in Art Nouveau stained-glass style, paintings of pool-playing dogs, Elvis posters, Marilyn posters, dartboards, a swivel cue rack in early-American motif, a full-size jukebox and $375 oak high chairs (with drink holders) designed, Mr. Loria said, for one purpose: to watch billiard games.</p>
        <p>Downstairs, past a staircase lined with billiard balls sawed in half, Mr. Loria gave a tour of a basement that looked a great deal like the basement of the Steinway Company showroom. There were piles of heavy wooden pieces, some new, some almost a century old, awaiting precise fitting into a delicate instrument.</p>
        <p>Mr. Loria picked up one rail and brushed off a diamond-shaped brass plaque from about 1912: Mfd. by V. Loria, 207 Bowery, New York, it read. ''This is my great-grandfather who made that table,'' Stephen Loria said.</p>
        <p>Although it's not advertised that way, customizing and installing a home pool table often amounts to interior decoration, Mr. Loria said. Some of his metal sculptures hang in the showroom. ''Actually, we're all artists in this family,'' he said.</p>
