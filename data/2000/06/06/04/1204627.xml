        <p>TIME is of the essence in prison, but Atiba Kwesi has had a lot of it to serve -- 24 years for robbery -- and a lot to spend on litigation against the New Jersey Parole Board.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kwesi is one of thousands of state inmates over the last few years to be caught in the board's backlog. His delay was resolved in one sense -- after seeing the board he was denied parole -- but he has spent three years in court seeking vindication.</p>
        <p>A Philadelphian who dropped out of high school and went to prison for a robbery in Pennsylvania at the age of 22, Mr. Kwesi has spent just four months on the outside since. He is now 40.</p>
        <p>Convicted in New Jersey in 1988, he was first turned down for parole in 1995 and given a new eligibility date of November 1996.</p>
        <p>In March 1997, still waiting for his preparole documents, which would include a ''home plan'' for living arrangements after release, he wrote to the parole board. A response dated April 2, 1997, told him, ''Please be advised that your package is complete.''</p>
        <p>But six days later, he received a request for a home plan.</p>
        <p>''Now I'm a little worried,'' he recalled in an interview last week. ''I don't know anything about the parole laws at this time, but now I'm a little concerned.''</p>
        <p>And the litigation began. Mr. Kwesi was in the New Jersey State Prison in Trenton, and he consulted a lifer there named Abdullah Douglas -- ''the brightest, sharpest jail house lawyer in the state,'' Mr. Kwesi said. Mr. Douglas told him how to challenge a parole board action in the appellate division of the New Jersey Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>He filed on April 22, 1997, and was notified on May 2, a Friday, that his parole hearing was scheduled for May 5. The problem, in Mr. Kwesi's account, is that the hearing was a videoconference, and he could not submit documents because he could not fax them to the panel.</p>
        <p>He demanded another hearing, which was held May 27, but it was also a videoconference. He refused to go and was denied parole in absentia. He appealed that decision, too.</p>
        <p>A year later, while his case was still before the state court, the parole board vacated its decision. But when he had no hearing as of January 1999, he filed a federal suit alleging that parole board members had violated his constitutional right to due process.</p>
        <p>Three months later, Mr. Kwesi went before a panel including Andrew B. Consovoy, the board chairman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kwesi said that at the hearing, Mr. Consovoy produced a copy of his federal court complaint ''and started questioning me on it.'' When the panel imposed a 32-month ''hit'' to be served before he would be eligible again, Mr. Kwesi said, Mr. Consovoy told him, ''We know you're past due, but we don't have to parole you.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Consovoy said he could not discuss the case, and Mr. Kwesi has no transcript of the hearing. He said he had tried for four months to get his court-appointed attorney to obtain one.</p>
        <p>In December, Federal District Judge Mary L. Cooper denied the state's motion to dismiss his case, but it stops and starts, and no trial date has been set.</p>
        <p>By now, Mr. Kwesi is a jail house lawyer to hundreds, working in the prison library and spending more hours at a word processor in his cell in Riverfront State Prison here.</p>
        <p>''I'm trying to do a few things right in my life,'' he said. ''I wasn't always the angel I am now.''</p>
        <p>When he first contemplated a class action, he wrote to Alan Dershowitz, Johnnie Cochran, lawyers in New Jersey, state officials and advocacy groups. ''Anybody,'' he said. ''I wrote anybody I could think of. Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, the Justice Department.''</p>
        <p>He got one response from the American Friends Service Committee in Newark, which also sent letters to inmates across the state telling them Mr. Kwesi was collecting cases.</p>
        <p>That was March 3, 1999. ''From that day on I was getting swamped,'' Mr. Kwesi said. ''That's when it started dawning on me how big it was. I found guys six months past eligibility. I found a guy eight years past eligibility. I have from various people and their families a good 600 letters.''</p>
        <p>Last fall, Mr. Kwesi culled 210 cases and mailed the inmates instructions on filing cases in state court. Most have since had hearings. Months later, a Haddonfield lawyer, Philip Stephen Fuoco, took on the class action, filed in federal court on May 2.</p>
        <p>As the letters still pour in, most are collected by an inmate-aid organization called And Justice for All, which Mr. Kwesi founded with Mr. Douglas and Elaine Selan, a Philadelphia consultant who trains mental-health professionals and got to know Mr. Kwesi when she wrote to him on behalf of an inmate with parole problems. Ms. Selan is the link between prisoners, family members and lawyers.</p>
        <p>''Most people don't have a clue to where to begin to fight the parole board,'' Mr. Kwesi said. But he said he does not have to explain much anymore, because ''everybody knows about the lawsuit.''</p>
