        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>While Leon Botstein's suggestion about improving the quality of testing through modern technology is valid (Op-Ed, May 28), it tends to reinforce the idea that this avenue is what educational progress requires.</p>
        <p>What is more important is the environment in which education occurs. A teaching philosophy that fires a student with the objective of the social good and a passion for the truth is what drives the educational engine.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>While Leon Botstein's suggestion about improving the quality of testing through modern technology is valid (Op-Ed, May 28), it tends to reinforce the idea that this avenue is what educational progress requires.</p>
        <p>What is more important is the environment in which education occurs. A teaching philosophy that fires a student with the objective of the social good and a passion for the truth is what drives the educational engine.</p>
        <p>The most constructive direction, therefore, is to attract those who are most capable of directing the classroom activity. Experience at times when better pay made teaching more attractive compared with other occupations suggests that raising teacher salaries is the best way to accomplish this.</p>
