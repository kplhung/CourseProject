        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''The Fear of Taking Paternity Leave'' (Workplace section, May 31), you describe the plight of fathers who do not take paternity leave because they are afraid of being ridiculed, discriminated against or even of losing their jobs. The problem is not restricted to fathers. Many employers also question the career commitment of any woman who dares to take more than the briefest maternity leave.</p>
        <p>I recently interviewed a group of highly distinguished women in science for a book about the factors affecting their success. All reported that young faculty members rarely feel free to take extended family leave, even if they can afford it, because they are afraid of jeopardizing their chances for promotion and tenure. They are still expected to follow career paths that were established at a time when most professional men had wives who were full-time homemakers and professional women were expected to remain childless.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, institutions whose employment policies truly meet the needs of today's two-career families with young children remain rare.</p>
