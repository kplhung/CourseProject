        <p>To prosecutors, it was a classic organized-crime case. The mob forced a contractor renovating a Midtown hotel to make weekly payments to prevent interference from unions.</p>
        <p>But charges against one defendant fell apart, prosecutors said, because of a weakness in New York's money-laundering laws, even though they were able to prove that the defendant had strong-armed the contractor into giving him $50,000, which was transferred to an account in Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p>The case was one of several that law enforcement officials cited after Gov. George E. Pataki proposed legislation last week to expand the definition of money laundering in the current state statute, and to increase penalties for laundering money.</p>
        <p>The governor cited concerns that too many money-laundering cases in New York were slipping through the cracks. His proposal has gained strong support from state and federal law enforcement authorities, and some powerful state legislators.</p>
        <p>The bill would allow state prosecutors to file hundreds of additional charges against potential defendants each year, state officials said.</p>
        <p>Federal authorities often use laws against money laundering -- the transfer of money to make proceeds from criminal activities appear to be legitimate gains -- to pursue criminals who would otherwise be difficult to prosecute.</p>
        <p>The federal statute is broader than the New York one. Under the New York law, a person cannot be convicted of money laundering unless the money being laundered is exchanged for other currency or a narrow list of other valuable items.</p>
        <p>The list includes money orders, travelers' checks, precious metals, jewelry and stamps, but does not include personal checks or goods like furniture, vehicles and construction equipment, making it easier to devise exchanges that are not covered by the state regulations.</p>
        <p>In money-laundering schemes, criminals often transfer money from illegal activities to companies they control, where it is used to buy products that can be used in those businesses or sold, transforming the money into a clean asset. The transactions often involve vehicles and construction equipment.</p>
        <p>The current law ''was designed by someone who never wanted to see it used,'' said Bridget G. Brennan, the special narcotics prosecutor in New York City. She said the governor's bill would lead to more prosecutions by broadening the definition of an exchanged good to include anything that prosecutors could prove was received in exchange for money derived from criminal activity. This is similar to the definition in the federal money- laundering law.</p>
        <p>''It makes no sense that the monetary instrument statute is so narrow that it does not cover wire transfers,'' said Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, whose office drafted the bill proposed by the governor.</p>
        <p>The bill would also increase the maximum sentence for money laundering from 7 years in prison to 25.</p>
        <p>In the State Senate, the Republican majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, has expressed support for the bill, and Speaker Sheldon Silver of the Democrat-led Assembly, whom Mr. Morgenthau has personally lobbied, is expected to announce his support in the coming weeks, officials said. Efforts to contact Mr. Silver through an aide were unsuccessful yesterday afternoon.</p>
        <p>In the hotel extortion case, prosecutors under Mr. Morgenthau were able to get an indictment of the defendant, William Capparelli of Queens, on extortion charges, but they said the case took much longer to investigate than a money-laundering case would have.</p>
        <p>The money-laundering law is so narrow that Mr. Capparelli could not have been convicted under it. And while his actions might have violated broader federal money-laundering statutes, federal prosecutors do not have enough resources to pursue every case, officials said.</p>
