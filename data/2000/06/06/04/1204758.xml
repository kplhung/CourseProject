        <p>Members of Community Board 6 overwhelmingly approved a resolution May 10 to oppose any food concession in any part of the park, which straddles Second Avenue between 15th and 17th Streets and is the centerpiece of the Stuyvesant Square Historic District.

        <p>Community board members are sharply opposing a plan to put a food stand in Stuyvesant Square Park. But park officials say the resistance is much too early, because nothing has been put on paper yet.</p>
        <p>Members of Community Board 6 overwhelmingly approved a resolution May 10 to oppose any food concession in any part of the park, which straddles Second Avenue between 15th and 17th Streets and is the centerpiece of the Stuyvesant Square Historic District. The resolution said that ''Community Board 6 was not invited to send a representative'' to a meeting about the matter, and contended that the city was issuing a request for proposals for the concession without having consulted the board.</p>
        <p>Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern said the opposition was ''entirely premature.''</p>
        <p>''It's just an idea for a seasonal cafe,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The plan is to renovate a kiosk in the southeast corner of the park for selling light snacks and refreshments. ''We don't know exactly what would be served,'' he said, ''but there would definitely be latte.''</p>
        <p>The disputed meeting was held on March 23 at the home of Eric Petterson, who owns three Manhattan restaurants, including  Luna Park, which operates inside Union Square Park. Some board members, and  members of the Stuyvesant Park Neighborhood Association, feared that Mr. Petterson was seeking the concession for himself.</p>
        <p>''That part of Union Square was public space, and it's no longer public space,''  Sylvia Friedman, chairwoman of the parks committee of Board 6, said of Luna Park. ''We used to sit there at the tables and have picnics, and we can't do that anymore.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pettersen said he wanted only to assemble neighbors with diverse opinions about the park and had no personal interest in the concession. ''I live there and I wanted to see some improvements, so I invited people that I knew who were active in the area,'' he said. ''The parks department makes these decisions, certainly not me.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Stern said that the meeting was not held in secret, and that it was private. A few parks employees did attend the meeting, according to a parks spokesman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stern also said no request for proposals had been drafted, but the agency might begin seeking them this summer.</p>
        <p>''The entire civilized world will have its say before anything is done,'' he said. ''And that includes the Landmarks Commission and the Art Commission. And, definitely, Board 6 will have its bite of the apple.''</p>
