        <p>The James Beard Foundation Awards, presented since 1991, are something like the Academy Awards of restaurants and chefs, recognized for setting ''new or consistent standards of excellence.'' This year's prizes, awarded last month in Manhattan, recognized two New Jerseyans. One was Craig Shelton, named best chef in the Mid-Atlantic region. He cooks at the elegant Ryland Inn in Millington, which he also owns. When we called him for a comment, he was in Chicago being inducted into the Fine Dining Hall of Fame, so we were directed to his press spokeswoman, Joan Szibdat. Mr. Shelton was ''delighted and thrilled,'' to win the award, she said, and he gave the black-tie crowd at the ceremony last month his heartfelt and emotional thanks. Since the annoucement, she added, ''Craig has received a torrent of responses from people in and outside the industry.''</p>

        <p>The James Beard Foundation Awards, presented since 1991, are something like the Academy Awards of restaurants and chefs, recognized for setting ''new or consistent standards of excellence.''

        <p>The other New Jersey award went to Anthony Basile, owner of the White House Sub Shop in Atlantic City, recipient of this year's Mid-Atlantic Regional Classic Award. These awards, begun a couple of years ago, go to ''classic locally owned and operated restaurnts beloved in their community,'' said Melanie Young, director of the awards. Mr. Basille was also not available for comment, so we were directed to Thomas Peterson, the shop's manager. Mr. Bassile was around but ''he doesn't talk too much,'' Mr. Peterson said. Mr. Basille was not in New York for the awards ceremony: ''He just couldn't get there,'' Mr. Peterson said. What has the response been? ''It hasn't been mentioned.'' Will the recognition change anything about the shop? Mr. Peterson doubts it. ''He's been the same for 50 years.''</p>
