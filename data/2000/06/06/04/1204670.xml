        <p>As a resident of Westchester since 1940 I was saddened last Sunday at the choice of the two cover stories, titled ''The Dealmaker'' and ''The Lure of a Bronxville Address.''</p>
        <p>Both had to do with greed and a perplexing value system that obviously is permeating our society. After all, this was Memorial Day weekend.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a resident of Westchester since 1940 I was saddened last Sunday at the choice of the two cover stories, titled ''The Dealmaker'' and ''The Lure of a Bronxville Address.''</p>
        <p>Both had to do with greed and a perplexing value system that obviously is permeating our society. After all, this was Memorial Day weekend.</p>
        <p>Maybe Iris Kalt gets ''turned on'' by making a sale, or tearing down a home on a prime piece of land, but is that really something anyone cares about?</p>
        <p>And if I lived in Yonkers and the address was not good enough for me, I would certainly move elsewhere. Do people really live and die by their addresses? I sure hope not.</p>
        <p>What about the more important issues, such as education, race, religion, mental illness, crime, arts, environment, quality of life?</p>
        <p>It seems to me that there could be some front page stories there -- and not what turns on one woman or sends people to their post offices because they don't have a Bronxville address.</p>
