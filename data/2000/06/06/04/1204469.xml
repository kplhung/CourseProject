        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Carol Gilligan's review is disturbingly nave. Abstractly relying on primate studies and on views of the discredited Margaret Mead, Gilligan seeks to refute Stephanie Gutmann's argument that the American military has become less effective as the result of gender neutrality. I am afraid that Gilligan's position is a product of the ''military illiteracy'' cited by the author and suffered by people who have not donned a uniform. The price of this social experimentation could be enormously high in the next major conflict. As the military historian John Keegan has observed: ''Women . . . rarely fight among themselves and they never, in any military sense, fight men. If warfare is as old as history and as universal as mankind, we must now enter the supremely important limitation that it is an entirely masculine activity.''</p>
