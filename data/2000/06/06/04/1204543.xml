        <p>'The longer you live in Paris, the easier it is to become a minimalist,'' says Andrew Zega, surveying the super-spare living room of his one-bedroom apartment near the old Les Halles market.

        <p>The German-born Dams, 36, and the Pennsylvania-born Zega, 39, are hardly Modernist zealots. After all, they met in the office of Robert A.M.

Today, the erudite pair produce sprightly books about structures of the ancient regime that are sometimes delirious, always romantic. The first, in 1995, was ''Pleasure Pavilions and Follies.''

        <p>'The longer you live in Paris, the easier it is to become a minimalist,'' says Andrew Zega, surveying the super-spare living room of his one-bedroom apartment near the old Les Halles market. ''People will put 17 chairs in a room half this size.'' His partner, Bernd Dams, adds, almost apologetically, ''We did buy an area rug once, but it just shrank the place.''</p>
        <p>The German-born Dams, 36, and the Pennsylvania-born Zega, 39, are hardly Modernist zealots. After all, they met in the office of Robert A.M. Stern, the neotraditionalist architect, where Dams was a designer and Zega did renderings. Today, the erudite pair produce sprightly books about structures of the ancient regime that are sometimes delirious, always romantic. The first, in 1995, was ''Pleasure Pavilions and Follies.'' Coming up in September is a study of French garden urns, depicted in illustrations that seamlessly wed Dams's meticulous draftsmanship to Zega's luminous watercolors.</p>
        <p>''Bernd draws, I paint and then we thrash out the proportions and details,'' Zega says. Like the barn owls and bald eagles painted by Zega's early influence, the bird artist Louis Agassiz Fuertes, the pair's palace facades and triumphant arches are photorealist images floating in white space. As Zega explains, ''No clouds, no happy days, just buildings.''</p>
        <p>Their apartment is a happy complement to their shared passion for fine old architecture that has been altered beyond recognition. Office by day, home by night, the 700-square-foot space occupies one floor of the former home of the head of Louis XIV's nurseries. Excepting a marble fireplace, a sparkling chandelier and the creaking parquet floor, every interior detail had been erased over the centuries. Rather than revive what was lost, the men created ''the loft we never had in New York'' within the 1693 shell.</p>
        <p>Furnishings are few but choice, and like the pair's art, all are set against an expanse of white: angular chairs by the Viennese Modernist Koloman Moser; 50's wrought-iron tables; sketches by Fragonard, Boucher and Emilio Terry. Formal, yes, but practical given the limitations. To create an entrance hall, Dams and Zega placed free-standing Doric columns at one end of the main room, where traffic swerves around a kidney-shaped table. Biedermeier game tables swivel open for dining or work. Niches became closets. And 1,800 books fill the built-in bookcases in the dining alcove and living area. The mirror-image shelving gives the main room an ingenious spatial order, or what Bernd Dams's calls ''an intellectual axis that crosses a living axis.''</p>
        <p>Still, French friends remain bewildered by the decor. ''Where's the gilt?'' they moan. To appease the naysayers, a frivolous fauteuil is tucked into a corner of the bedroom. The chair satisfies, but just barely. ''It's a faux-faux thing from the 40's,'' Dams says with a laugh. ''And what's more, we got it in New York.''</p>
