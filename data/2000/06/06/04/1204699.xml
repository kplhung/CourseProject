        <p>They said they would rather die than leave their homes. But low-income families in Pleasant East Apartments, federally subsidized buildings on East 117th and 119th Streets, will not have to depart now that the Department of Housing and Urban Development has decided to let their buildings stand.</p>
        <p>The agency, which has been in a dispute with the landlord, took control of Pleasant East in February. After an inspection, the department  deemed the building unsafe. Tenants received eviction letters, notifying them that the building would be shuttered on July 1 and ultimately razed. But residents, convinced that simple repairs could save the buildings, organized marches to protest the evictions with the help of Acorn, a Bronx  community group.</p>
        <p>Then local officials, like Representative Charles B. Rangel, Senator Charles E. Schumer and Borough President C. Virginia Fields, stepped in, encouraging HUD to inspect the building once again.</p>
        <p>Charlie King, the New York representative of Andrew M. Cuomo, the federal Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, said the agency did perform subsequent inspections that proved the initial conclusions incorrect. ''We had more information as we went along, and necessarily made a different determination,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Residents are thrilled. ''Oh my God, beautiful, wonderful, we're so happy,'' said Carmen Estrada, president of the Pleasant East Tenants Association. She said 110 families would be spared eviction. ''They still need to fix some things like the elevators, the windows, parts of the public area, but the apartments have always been beautiful and safe,'' she added.</p>
        <p>Mr. King added: ''The good news is that the tenants will be able to stay in the place they call home as long as they like. The great news is that we'll be able to make the changes that need to be made in the building.''</p>
