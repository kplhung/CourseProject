        <p>THEY are perfectly, inexplicably, at home in the boutiques of SoHo, as though they had been designed along with the decor: the gorgeous bald men standing security at the door, like Secret Service agents trained for fashion detail; the painfully pretty stick-figure saleswomen who double as designer mannequins; the austere cashiers absently recounting last night's club escapades into the phone.</p>
        <p>They might not admit it, but they size you up as you pass through the glass doors. They seem able to tell when you're indulging in a Cinderella fantasy by trying on that $3,000 dress and when you're ready to really spend.</p>

        <p>THEY are perfectly, inexplicably, at home in the boutiques of SoHo, as though they had been designed along with the decor: the gorgeous bald men standing security at the door, like Secret Service agents trained for fashion detail; the painfully pretty stick-figure saleswomen who double as designer mannequins; the austere cashiers absently recounting last night's club escapades into the phone.</p>
        <p>They might not admit it, but they size you up as you pass through the glass doors. They seem able to tell when you're indulging in a Cinderella fantasy by trying on that $3,000 dress and when you're ready to really spend.</p>
        <p>When they do cozy up to you, they will scour the store, filling dressing rooms with clothes. They become safari guides through fabric textures and colors. And they will summon staff to coo over you in that $3,000 dress.</p>
        <p>Unless you are inured to an icy once-over, it is hard to ignore the feeling of slight intimidation as you enter a trendy SoHo boutique. But do salespeople purposely cultivate that feeling?</p>
        <p>Asking store owners and salespeople about this issue is a delicate operation. Some, like a manager at Jill Stuart on Greene Street, which sells frilly, baby-doll dresses in a space vast enough to practice echoes, said she was too busy to discuss business, though there were no customers in sight. Others were unexpectedly candid about their attitudes.</p>
        <p>Most salespeople said, rather predictably, that they tried not to judge customers in advance. After all, they explained, it's impossible to tell exactly how much money a person has based simply on their attire.</p>
        <p>''Someone could come in with very trendy clothes and then they look and just leave,'' said Pascale Guiguin, the manager at Barbara Bui on Broome Street. ''Another person might come in with nothing in their hands at all, just a credit card in their jeans, and end up spending $2,000 to $3,000.''</p>
        <p>But Ertan Seyhun, who owns two Prince Street stores called Institut that carry the creations of some 500 young, experimental designers, looks for certain clues. As he guided a visitor through the larger store, its racks filled with colorful spring attire such as a red and pink hand-dyed silk top by Enjoy ($145) and a deliberately crumpled white linen dress by Kaj Ani ($355), he explained the seasonal nuances of sizing up customers.</p>
        <p>''In the beginning of each season, the people who come spend more often because they want something new and fresh,'' he said. ''They don't buy out of necessity, they buy because they want it. In the middle of the season, they buy out of necessity.''</p>
        <p>How does he know if someone is unlikely to spend? ''They look like they're too good to be shopping with us,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In his second store, where the clothes in the window were displayed on a bed of eggshells, a manager, Diego Erazo, could be found discussing the evening's clubbing with a tall, lithe friend who fingered a tiny pink chemise. ''Oh, this is sexy,'' she said. ''What it is going to cover? My nipple?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Erazo believes he can tell the difference between a woman who just wants to browse and one who is serious about shopping.</p>
        <p>''When they go into a room and try on 10 dresses at one time, they're not going to buy,'' he said. ''When they want to buy something, they just come in and get it. We just know.''</p>
        <p>They also know at Barbara Bui, a high-end boutique owned by the French-Vietnamese designer of the same name, where customers are greeted by a sweep of concrete floor punctuated by tall Roman pillars. Ms. Bui was eager to maintain the look of the gallery that once occupied the space, and her clothes are presented much like works of art. Some are on display in pine and glass museum cases. Others, like bathing suits and men's briefs, are pressed in vacuum-sealed plastic bags hung on the walls from chrome hooks.</p>
        <p>Pascale Guiguin, the manager, admitted that some people felt intimidated as they confronted the discreet rows of garments, priced from $45 for underwear to a few thousand for a dress. But, she added, 70 percent of the people who entered the store ended up buying.</p>
        <p>''For me, the best customer, when they come into the store, they're not dressed like a model,'' she said. ''The ones who come in dressed as models never purchase anything.''</p>
        <p>Raymond Mai, a salesman at Diesel StyleLab on West Broadway and an avid SoHo shopper, said salespeople who worked on commission were more likely to make snap judgments about a customer's willingness to buy than those who received fixed salaries. A shopping bag can be a dead giveaway.</p>
        <p>''If they've got an H&amp;M bag, they won't buy anything here,'' Mr. Mai said. ''They're clearly bargain hunters, and they'll complain about the price, even if they love the item. People who are willing to spend are part of a family, like a mom and dad who are sitting down watching a daughter shop, or a couple, where the man is there to observe. There's a higher chance of someone buying if they're with someone else.''</p>
        <p>When Mr. Mai shops in SoHo, he too feels pressure to look the part.</p>
        <p>''It's not about looking rich, it's about looking fashionable,'' he said. ''If I go to D&amp;G'' -- Dolce and Gabbana -- ''where they sell all that beaded stuff, I might wear a beaded shirt. Then the salespeople will come up to me and tell me how nice my shirt is. I like that attention. And then they show me other items I'll like.''</p>
        <p>At Kirna Zabete on Greene Street, management appears to be aware of the intimidation some SoHo shoppers feel. ''Come In. Hang Out. Make yourself at home,'' reads a sign behind the guard at the front door. ''Ask for help. Check your e-mail.'' (You actually can.) ''Obsess over something extravagant. Treat Yourself.''</p>
        <p>Treating yourself to something extravagant is the key issue at Kirna Zabete, where a purple and white Balenciaga shirt sells for $435 and a simple white sun dress by the Italian designer Hussein Chalayan goes for $480. There are cheaper items downstairs, the security guard may explain. But a customer looking for real discounts should keep walking.</p>
