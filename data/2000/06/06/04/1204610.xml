      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>CONTRARY to what you might think, the name of this restaurant has nothing to do with Montclair's best-known citizen, Yogi Berra, who is famously (and probably erroneously) supposed to have said, ''It's deja vu all over again.'' Manop Sutipayakul, who is both co-chef and co-owner, says modestly that the name was meant to suggest that diners might want to return again and again.</p>
        <p>I think he's on to something, because there is plenty to come back for. You will find amazing things on the menu of this 15-month-old French-Thai ''fusion'' restaurant on the main drag of downtown Montclair. Green papaya keeping company with roasted garlic and anchovy-chili paste. A whole grilled fish on a banana leaf. Lime leaves. Lemongrass. One recent Monday night, wild boar wandered in from D'Artagnan, the Newark game purveyor, and found itself sharing a plate with a cornucopia of vegetables -- black beans, red pepper, zucchini, little Thai eggplant -- in a chili-infused sauce that could make a pig dance.</p>

        <p>I think he's on to something, because there is plenty to come back for. You will find amazing things on the menu of this 15-month-old French-Thai ''fusion'' restaurant on the main drag of downtown Montclair. Green papaya keeping company with roasted garlic and anchovy-chili paste. A whole grilled fish on a banana leaf. Lime leaves. Lemongrass. One recent Monday night, wild boar wandered in from D'Artagnan, the Newark game purveyor, and found itself sharing a plate with a cornucopia of vegetables -- black beans, red pepper, zucchini, little Thai eggplant -- in a chili-infused sauce that could make a pig dance.</p>
        <p>French and Thai choices face each other like Columns A and B on an old-fashioned Chinese menu: gravlax and steak au poivre on the left, chicken satay and Bangkok duck on the right. The two chefs -- Mr. Sutipayakul and Sandy Vithanage, whose husband, Sam, is the other owner -- learned to cook in Thailand, and both spent time in the Manhattan restaurant crucible before opening Deja Vu in March 1999. Significantly, Ms. Vithanage worked at Vong with Jean-Georges Vongerichten, the wildly successful pioneer of French-Thai fusion in New York.</p>
        <p>While history and geography offer nothing to support a marriage of these two cuisines (France was a colonial power in Vietnam and Cambodia, but not in Thailand), there's a certain logic to it, and a happy serendipity. ''The ideas can be adapted,'' Mr. Sutipayakul said. ''In French food they use butter and cream; in Thai food they use coconut milk.''</p>
        <p>The French dishes at Deja Vu do not, in truth, work as well as the Thai ones. One night, salmon with a fricassee of vegetables was listless and bland; on another night, rack of lamb would have been merely correct even if it had been better trimmed and cooked medium rare, as ordered, rather than almost raw. But those French techniques and ingredients do not go to waste: when applied to the other side of the menu, they raise Thai cooking to a level of invention seldom seen at this end of the Lincoln Tunnel.</p>
        <p>That wild boar wasn't the half of it. (In fact, the meat itself was dense and dry, though it was moistened and enlivened by the vegetable melange and the sauce.) Adventurous as I felt for having ordered it, I couldn't take my eyes off a fellow diner's broiled lobster, a brilliant-red Esther Williams production of meat first cooked in the shell and then removed, smothered in a powerful garlic-and-pepper sauce, returned to the shell and finished in the oven. All right, so it was a little tough; it was sweet and hugely satisfying.</p>
        <p>The boar and lobster were specials; the regular Thai menu includes half a dozen items marked ''Hot off the grill,'' and I'd happily return here six times and order them all (deja vu all over again). We tried the whole sea bass -- a magnificent specimen, glazed with a paste of chilies, tamarind and Thai fish sauce, sitting on a great tarpaulin of banana leaf with sticky rice and a brace of grilled vegetables. (Mr. Sutipayakul grills the banana leaf along with the fish to lend a faint smokiness to the dish.) The grilled dishes are served with a trio of dipping sauces; the runaway winner at our table was a cool and bracing green sauce fragrant with cilantro.</p>
        <p>Appetizers are similarly vivid and exuberant, from spicy duck or beef salad in a crisp rice-flour shell to a roasted half eggplant with shrimp and green beans. And here the French side of the menu does not disappoint, with salty gravlax on fluffy little green pancakes, perfectly set off by fat-free horseradish creme fraiche; a meaty whole quail on a pile of green beans and soybeans; and peppery, nicely seared tuna sashimi with what the menu calls ''Asian Nicoise soy mustard.''</p>
        <p>After all this excitement, you might feel that dessert is more than you really need, and you might be right. Bananas Julie, caramelized bananas with vanilla ice cream and passion-fruit-and-raspberry sauce, is inventive and well prepared, but seems like piling on; chocolate mousse is, well, just chocolate mousse. A simple and lovely salad of fresh fruit -- mango, banana, kiwi and pineapple with passion fruit juice -- seems more than sufficient. Or you might relax with a cup of Thai iced tea, a sweet and smoky brew that you sip with a straw: it rises to meet you through a cloud of cream.</p>
        <p>Prices range more widely here than at most restaurants, with some real bargains. Dinner specials tend to be $25, but most of the Thai grilled dishes are $14 to $16, so you can escape quite comfortably for less than $40 a person. You bring your own wine or beer; a spicy or off-dry wine, like gewurztraminer or riesling, is terrific with this food.</p>
        <p>Deja Vu is small -- just 54 seats -- and the decor is basic downtown storefront: nearly bare walls painted ocher, with a wall-length mirror that does not succeed in creating the illusion of size. On a Saturday night, the room was crowded and painfully noisy, and the servers struggled earnestly and not always successfully to keep up. Still, it's a tribute to this restaurant, and to the vision and skill of its owners and chefs, that none of these distractions diminished the sheer radiant energy of the food, which will leave a glow in your mouth long after you've gone home.</p>
