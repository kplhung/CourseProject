        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Laura Stichter-Bryson's statement that residents of the Cedar Knolls and Lawrence Park West sections of Yonkers ''have no association whatsoever with Yonkers, not socially or in any other way, shape or form'' is incorrect and potentially dangerous (''The Lure of a Bronxville Address,'' May 28).</p>
        <p>Residents of these areas may choose to shop outside Yonkers and send their children to private or parochial schools. However, if they wish to exercise their right to vote, they will cast their ballots in the gymnasiums of Yonkers public schools. If they have concerns about their property taxes or their neighborhoods, they will need to voice them to Yonkers officials.</p>

        <p>If they need to report a fire or a crime, they must call Yonkers police and firefighters.</p>
        <p>It is disingenuous for Ms. Stichter-Bryson to suggest that residents of Cedar Knolls and Lawrence Park West say they live in Bronxville. The address entitles them to postal delivery from Bronxville, and that is all.</p>
