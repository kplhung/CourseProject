        <p>Lowe's contract was tied to Sather's. Sather said yesterday that he would not speak to him until he was certain Lowe was contractually free.</p>
        <p>Lowe is Sather's first choice by a large margin, but he said yesterday he had begun compiling a list of candidates, including John Paddock of the Rangers' Hartford affiliate.</p>
