        <p>Jackson L. Wilson Jr. oversees a small fraction of Andersen Consulting's 65,000 employees, but he may be the most closely watched member of the firm.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilson runs AC Ventures, an arm of the firm that invests in Internet start-ups and other companies that have not gone public. For the last three years, the returns on those risky investments have been shared by the firm's partners. But in September, Andersen Consulting plans to start giving employees shares that track the performance of the venture fund.</p>
        <p>''I used to have 1,300 partners who want to know what we're doing every day,'' Mr. Wilson said in a recent telephone interview from Beijing, where he was advising the Chinese government on the development of a technology center. ''Now, I have 40,000 employees who want to know what we're doing every day.''</p>
        <p>His co-workers probably want to hear more of the same. AC Ventures, which started with about $75 million, scored big early. Its first move was to put $3 million into Siebel Systems, a software company that went public in 1996. That stake grew to be worth more than $1 billion.</p>
        <p>Its next investment was in Qpass, an electronic commerce company that Mr. Wilson says was ''an absolute start-up'' in 1997 when one of its founders approached AC Ventures. Qpass has held five rounds of private financing since then, leaving AC Ventures with an 8 percent stake and hopes of an initial public offering soon, Mr. Wilson says.</p>
        <p>Of about 40 investments so far, he says, ''there are probably four in that stack that haven't gone anywhere.'' But Mr. Wilson insists the stellar record has not gone to his head.</p>
        <p>''I try to be very careful not to create the impression that AC Ventures is the sweet spot'' at Andersen, he says. ''The last thing I want to do is alienate our partners.''</p>
