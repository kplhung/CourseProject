        <p>IAN HAWKER was convicted and sentenced in Bergen County last year for a fairly simple offense, hindering arrest, and was eligible for parole March 10. That was the day when -- unless the parole board established that he was likely to commit another crime -- he was supposed to be able to walk out the door at Riverfront State Prison here.</p>
        <p>Last week, more than six months after it was due, parole officials put together the paperwork necessary for a hearing.</p>
        <p>The 36-year-old Brooklyn man could be out soon, but his problem will remain before the federal district court here. Although his case is far from the most egregious in the system, where delays of a year are not uncommon, he is one of three named plaintiffs at Riverfront in a lawsuit claiming that the troubled New Jersey State Parole Board is leaving hundreds of inmates without hearings while their parole eligibility dates come and go.</p>
        <p>The suit, filed last month, has brought new attention to an agency determined to avoid it. While parole board officials say they are catching up with a problem that was much worse a year ago, news reports of the backlog has raised questions -- which the board will not answer because the matter is in court -- as to whether its official reports to other state agencies wittingly omitted several hundred cases.</p>
        <p>Nor is that the end of the accusations.</p>
        <p>The board's chairman, Andrew B. Consovoy, is himself under investigation for irregularities in several cases, according to people contacted by investigators. And for months the board has shut off the public: its telephone line is answered by a recording that instructs all callers, including attorneys, that inquiries can be handled only in writing.</p>
        <p>The problem, the board's critics say, is an agency that answers to no one except the governor while serving -- or disserving -- a group that has little public sympathy or official representation.</p>
        <p>''They operate with nobody over them,'' said Atiba Kwesi, an inmate at Riverfront who collected hundreds of complaints for the lawsuit. ''The only person who tells them what to do is the governor, and she's, like, 'Do what you want to do.' ''</p>
        <p>In an interview at Riverfront, Mr. Kwesi said that between pursuing his own case, now in federal court in Trenton, and working as a law clerk in the prison library, he had become a magnet for inmate grievances. Pulling folders from a carton, he described a blitz of 100 letters asking for help initiating a class action lawsuit; except for the American Friends Service Committee in Newark, ''nobody wrote back,'' he said. ''Nobody cared.''</p>
        <p>Joseph A. Osefchen, one of two Haddonfield lawyers who took on the case, acknowledged that telling people he represents criminals is ''kind of like saying, 'I work at the leper colony.' It couldn't happen to any other group.''</p>
        <p>''They don't answer their phones,'' he said of the board, with some incredulity. ''If you were a year behind on Social Security payments, there'd be blood in the streets.''</p>
        <p>The suit claims that the number of inmates who have passed their parole dates without the required hearings could be as many as 1,000. The board's latest report lists about 300. But according to a document given to reporters by sources close to the board -- who described it as an internal accounting of cases that are in a special investigative unit and not included in the board's official report -- another 729 inmates were awaiting hearings as of last month.</p>
        <p>No one knows how many others are past eligible but not counted as such because the case files required for hearings are incomplete -- a problem that parole board officials blame on the Department of Corrections. Hundreds more have been heard by a panel, but deferred, some of them for years, without any decision.</p>
        <p>''This seems to go well beyond the bounds of what's permissible,'' said Marc Mauer, the assistant director of the Sentencing Project, an advocacy group in Washington.</p>
        <p>While no one keeps state-by-state numbers on parole backlogs, Mr. Mauer said, ''nobody here is aware of that being a substantial issue in other states.''</p>
        <p>''It's worse in New Jersey than in other places,'' he said. ''They literally just don't do it on time.'' In other states, he said, inmates ''may complain that they get five minutes with the parole board or the governor doesn't want to parole anybody, but technically they follow the law.''</p>
        <p>Jayne O'Connor, Governor Whitman's press secretary, said that the governor has consistently directed the board to eliminate the backlog.</p>
        <p>''The backlog has been significantly reduced, and the governor expects it to be reduced further, Ms. O'Connor said.</p>
        <p>In New Jersey, the courts are inmates' only avenue of redress against state agencies. And unlike New York, which has a state-financed agency that litigates on behalf of prisoners, New Jersey leaves them to represent themselves or find a private lawyer.</p>
        <p>The Department of the Public Advocate, which had an office that represented prisoners in civil suits, was abolished by Governor Whitman in 1994, and the public defenders office only represents inmates in their criminal cases.</p>
        <p>The movement away from parole -- the release of a prisoner to serve the remainder of his or her term under supervision -- is nationwide. As the idea of rehabilitation has receded, many states have limited parole, and 14 have abolished it altogether; among inmates leaving prison, the Justice Department reports, the proportion released by parole boards declined to 26 percent in 1998 from about 40 percent in 1990.</p>
        <p>New Jersey has not followed the trend to denying more parole applications; the board has consistently granted parole, if belatedly, in about two-thirds of cases over the last five years. Like many states, though, New Jersey has tightened eligibility rules, and since 1997 has required those convicted of certain serious crimes to serve 85 percent of their time before they are eligible for parole.</p>
        <p>Still, the courts have held that where the law provides for parole, it is a right rather than a privilege and no inmate can be denied a timely hearing.</p>
        <p>Under the New Jersey Parole Act, every inmate is entitled to release on</p>
        <p>his or her parole date, usually after serving one-third of a term or completing a mandatory minimum, unless the inmate ''failed to cooperate in his or her own rehabilitation'' or the Parole Board finds a ''reasonable expectation'' that the inmate would violate parole conditions.</p>
        <p>At least four months before that date, the board must have a ''pre-parole report,'' to be given to the inmate and reviewed by a hearing officer and a board member. A minority of inmates, 30 percent to 40 percent, are approved for parole on the hearing officers recommendation; the rest, after that initial hearing, go before panels of two board members.</p>
        <p>The panel hearing is to be held at least 30 days before the parole eligibility date. But even if the initial hearing is on time, many cases are diverted, often to a ''major crimes unit'' where serious cases undergo intensive investigations before going to the panels.</p>
        <p>No one disputes that the parole board is short on resources. The agency has about 180 employees to handle an inmate population of more than 30,000, up from about 6,000 in 1980.</p>
        <p>Even parole board officials concede that they have a backlog. But both the board and the state attorney general's office, which is defending the lawsuit, say they cannot discuss the cases that have been delayed because the matter is in litigation. A biweekly report distributed to other state agencies but not made public gives the numbers, but sources at the board say that in recent months it has omitted cases in the major crimes unit and those deferred after panel hearings.</p>
        <p>The parole board's executive director, Robert Egles, did say in an interview that board members were working furiously on their regular caseload, about 1,500 a month, and holding hearings for those backed up. He said the 10 board members were hearing cases every day and working Saturdays.</p>
        <p>''The problems that existed are so far into the process of being resolved that I don't know what all this is about,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The board's latest report, issued May 15, lists 137 ''past eligibles'' with completed files awaiting initial hearings and 166 more awaiting panel hearings. Its report listed tk past-eligible cases awaiting an initial hearing and 286 pending before the panels.</p>
        <p>Even the most recent official numbers are undercounts, since they do not include inmates with eligibility dates in May -- a total of 62 -- as past-eligible, and they could not be released until weeks after a hearing.</p>
        <p>And those figures omit cases stuck in the major crimes unit, according to two high-level board employees who did not want to be identified for fear of losing their jobs. A memorandum that one of them provided The New York Times, with handwriting that he identified as the chairman's, put that number at 729 as the first week in May.</p>
        <p>Another parole official said that board members were dismayed to learn after the class-action was filed that the official reports were incomplete, and that one demanded an accounting from Mr. Consovoy -- which resulted in the memo listing cases in the major crimes unit.</p>
        <p>The backlog is not new, and indeed it is probably smaller than it was a few years ago. Stephen M. Latimer, a Hackensack lawyer who brought an unsuccessful suit against the parole board in 1988, said that at the time ''the class was in the thousands -- it affected almost everybody in the system.''</p>
        <p>One board employee who spoke on condition of anonymity said that at as of a few years ago at Northern State Prison in Newark, ''they were not producing any on time at all, so everybody was past-eligible.''</p>
        <p>Lawyers and prisoner-advocate groups say that while they have no way of knowing whether the backlog has shrunk, since the parole board does not release statistics, it appears to persist.</p>
        <p>Barry Albin, the president of the Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers of New Jersey, said Mr. Consovoy had promised the organization several months ago that the backlog would disappear. ''I'd like to think we can believe the numbers given by government officials,'' Mr. Albin said. ''On the other hand, since I've been president of the association, we've receieved scores of letter from inmates complaining of delays.''</p>
        <p>In a letter to the American Friends Service Committee in Newark in March 1999, the board's deputy associate director, Michael Carlin, said, ''Chairman Consovoy has undertaken an initiative designed to eliminate all past-eligible parole cases in every institution by the end of June.''</p>
        <p>In February, when the Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers of New Jersey threatened to sue over the backlog, Mr. Consovoy told The New Jersey Law Journal: ''I guarantee you in a month or two we will be even.''</p>
        <p>And in the current crush of hearings, lawyers and inmates say, many are rushed and incomplete, resulting in yet more deferrals -- which erase an inmate from the backlog but still leave him without any resolution, typically for months.</p>
        <p>The number of cases deferred by the panels had already jumped to 2,137 in fiscal year 1998, the last year for which figures are available, from 1,404 the previous before.</p>
        <p>Typically, these cases, like those sent to the major crimes unit before a panel hearing, are put aside pending ''in-depth'' psychological examinations, which take six months to a year to complete.</p>
        <p>Mr. Egles defended the major crimes unit and the deferrals, especially those requiring the psychological examinations. ''I'm surprised there's so much concern that a state agency is taking so much time to get the information it needs to make decisions,'' he said.</p>
        <p>While insisting that most cases are handled on time, Mr. Egles said, ''Outcome is not available on demand.'' Comparing the information-gathering process to working on a house, he added: ''Maybe you order new windows and they're supposed to come in six weeks, and they don't.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Egles said the board required thorough investigation of serious offenders -- and the major crimes unit's half-dozen investigators may require crime-scene photographs, witness interviews, grand jury transcripts and the like -- to assess the risk that they will commit another crime.</p>
        <p>''If we miss something -- we think a guy's a burglar and he's a sexually predatory disaster waiting to happen,'' he said, ''somebody's going to get hurt.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Osefchen agreed that the board only stands to lose by releasing people. ''You can't go wrong denying people parole because only the inmates and their families care,'' he said. ''You can only go wrong granting it.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, recent news articles reported that Mr. Consovoy was under investigation by the state police and the attorney general's official corruption unit for his role in the release of two inmates, one a judge's son and the other identified as a member of the Gambino crime family. While the attorney general's office declined to confirm any investigation, three people close to the parole board said they had been questioned by investigators.</p>
        <p>Mr. Consovoy has said that he acted properly and that the accusations were made by disgruntled former employees.</p>
        <p>It is not clear whether the attorney generals office, which is defending the inmates lawsuit, is looking into the backlog, or whether the state has any other means of enforcing its own statutory requirements.</p>
        <p>One person close to the parole board said he called the attorney general's office after the class-action was filed to offer evidence that the numbers provided the office by the parole board were purposely incomplete. He said that a lawyer there told him he would have to give the information to investigators, and took his name and number, but that no investigator ever called.</p>
        <p>Whether or not the backlog is correctly accounted for, lawyers representing inmates say it should not exist at all -- that each time the parole board fails to comply with the law's timetable for hearings it violates the inmates right to due process.</p>
        <p>In principle, the courts agree. In two cases in Trenton, for example, one of them Mr. Kwesi's, federal district judges in Trenton recently denied the state's motions to dismiss, holding that the inmates had a constitutional right to an on-time hearing and could proceed with their suits. And state court judges have ordered that hearings be scheduled for inmates in several individual cases brought recently. Securing a result is another matter, however. Lawyers say they are reluctant to press such cases, since an inmate who goes to court to request a hearing may simply be given one -- and a denial of parole -- so that his case will be moot. And while a federal suit alleging constitutional violations would circumvent that problem, none has reached a final determination.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, while the Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers was protesting to Mr. Consovoy, one member, Philip Stephen Fuoco of Haddonfield, agreed to file a class action. Mr. Osefchen, his associate, met with Mr. Kwesi to choose representative cases.</p>
        <p>One was Mr. Hawkers. A second plaintiff, Nelson Miles, was eligible for parole Aug. 9. Although Mr. Miles had a hearing nine days after the suit was filed, he said in a telephone interview, the panel members did not have his preparole documents.</p>
        <p>''That's not a valid hearing,'' Mr. Miles said. ''But they can disregard your rights.''</p>
        <p>He said the board denied parole, telling him he would have to wait until his term expires; he believes that will be late this year or early next year, but says he does not have his official calculation sheet.</p>
        <p>The third plaintiff, Jamaine Lawrence, was eligible in January. He, too, received a hearing last month and was denied parole.</p>
        <p>While past-eligible inmates will automatically be members of the class, if it is certified by the court, more than 100 have written to Mr. Osefchen. And the letters keep coming in to And Justice for All, the advocacy group that Mr. Kwesi co-founded with another inmate and a prison-rights activist in Philadelphia, Elaine Selan.</p>
        <p>An inmate in Bayside State Prison, for example, wrote that his eligibility date was October 1998 and that he still had no parole package, which was due in June 1998; his term expires this month. Another in Bayside, who was eligible for parole Nov. 6, said he had seen a hearing officer but was told that no action was possible because no one could find his judgment of conviction.</p>
        <p>A South Woods inmate, whose paperwork was lost for five months, enclosed a letter to the Department of Corrections ombudsman: ''As much as I try to be accountable for the things that I do while in this system and in preparation for my release,'' he wrote the ombudsman, ''it seems like somewhere along the line I would get the same back in return.'' He said the letter had brought no response. Others told of getting deferred after initial hearings for in-depth psychological exams or for other reasons. A woman in the Edna Mahan facility in Clinton said she had heard nothing since her case was sent to the major crimes unit in October; her eligibility date was Feb. 3. In the meantime, she said, she applied for a halfway-house placement and was told that a decision ''would be based on the outcome of my panel hearing.''</p>
        <p>Other inmates are backed up at another bottleneck, awaiting a decision many months after going before the panels. A man in the Mid-State prison in Wrightstown, for example, said in a letter to The New York Times that he had a panel hearing on June 6, 1999, and was told he needed a psychological evaluation; his letter, dated May 20, said no examination had been scheduled.</p>
        <p>Most inmates say they have repeatedly written to the board and the Department of Corrections, which is responsible for providing documents and keeping track of inmates' status, and have received fragmentary replies at best.</p>
        <p>Chris Carden, a spokesman for the Department of Corrections, said the department and the parole board ''have been working together to try to minimize the number of delays.'' He said the department, which spends $58 a day to house an inmate, was ''certainly not interestered in keeping anybody incarcerated beyond their parole date.''</p>
        <p>Inmates are hard-pressed to bring their own suits, given court and clerical costs, like photocopying fees, as well as their lack of information and basic writing skills.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kwesi said that at Edna Mahon, for example, there is no photocopier for use by inmates, who sometimes wait for weeks for prison employees to have documents copied. ''How are you going to litigate if you've got time limits on this stuff and you have to wait three weeks to get something copied?'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fuoco and Mr. Osefchen are considering a second suit, this one on behalf of inmates who have been had board hearings but were then deferred beyond their eligibility dates. The lawyers already have piles of letters.</p>
