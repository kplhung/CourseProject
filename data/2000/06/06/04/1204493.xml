        <p>When a man with a gift for charming others meets a woman with a gift for making others feel charming, there is no telling how it will end. Sometime around Easter of 1997, Bill Clinton called Lindy Boggs, whom he had known since he was a college student, and asked her, somewhat improbably, to become his ambassador to the Holy See. (She ''is maybe the only person on the earth who could convince the pope that I am worth dealing with,'' Clinton has joked to his friends.) Lindy told Clinton she would think about it, but she was only being polite. Almost as soon as he had made the offer, she had made up her mind to decline it. She was 82 years old, spoke no Italian and knew no one in Rome. She intended to end her days as she had begun them, in private life, in New Orleans.</p>
        <p>Then she changed her mind. As she tells it, she was standing one Sunday morning at the back of St. Louis Cathedral (which is just down the street from her home) in front of the chapel dedicated to Our Lady of Prompt Succor. Our Lady of Prompt Succor is the saint to whom the local Ursuline nuns prayed on behalf of Andrew Jackson before the Battle of New Orleans. (After the battle, Jackson went immediately to the nuns to thank them for the saint's intercession.)

        <p>When a man with a gift for charming others meets a woman with a gift for making others feel charming, there is no telling how it will end. Sometime around Easter of 1997, Bill Clinton called Lindy Boggs, whom he had known since he was a college student, and asked her, somewhat improbably, to become his ambassador to the Holy See. (She ''is maybe the only person on the earth who could convince the pope that I am worth dealing with,'' Clinton has joked to his friends.) Lindy told Clinton she would think about it, but she was only being polite. Almost as soon as he had made the offer, she had made up her mind to decline it. She was 82 years old, spoke no Italian and knew no one in Rome. She intended to end her days as she had begun them, in private life, in New Orleans.</p>
        <p>Then she changed her mind. As she tells it, she was standing one Sunday morning at the back of St. Louis Cathedral (which is just down the street from her home) in front of the chapel dedicated to Our Lady of Prompt Succor. Our Lady of Prompt Succor is the saint to whom the local Ursuline nuns prayed on behalf of Andrew Jackson before the Battle of New Orleans. (After the battle, Jackson went immediately to the nuns to thank them for the saint's intercession.) Standing before Our Lady of Prompt Succor, Lindy recalls: ''I thought: Lindy Boggs, you are a big sissy. If the president asks you to do a job, you could at least give it a try.''</p>
        <p>In Rome these days, you hear so many anecdotes about Lindy Boggs that you have to remind yourself how little time she has had to generate them. The morning after she arrived to take up the ambassador's post, she was informed that she was to be seated that night at a table filled with nothing but cardinals; she mulled that over, then said, ''I think I'll wear red.'' There was the time Lindy exchanged three phone calls in one day with an Italian archbishop on some minor piece of Vatican diplomacy. Picking up the receiver the last time, she said, ''Dahlin', does this mean we're going steady?'' And there was the trip to the hospital after Lindy had fallen in her driveway and broken her knee. As she was wheeled in, her eyes lit on a tall, dark Italian surgeon. ''Tell me, doctor,'' she said, ''is it a prerequisite in Italy that all doctors have to be handsome?''</p>
        <p>The woman who passed along this last anecdote happened to work at the American Embassy at the Holy See. She suggested that if I wanted to hear more of this sort of thing, I had come to the right place. Whatever else our ambassador had absorbed in her two and a half years on the job, she had clearly learned that a woman in her mid-80's surrounded by men in dresses sworn to vows of celibacy can say whatever she pleases.</p>
        <p>''Is it true that she calls the pope 'Dahlin''?'' I asked.</p>
        <p>''You'll have to ask the ambassador that.''</p>
        <p>The last time I had seen Lindy Boggs, she was making a less-than-convincing attempt to leave politics. Her career as an elected official had just ended, as it began, with a death in her family. She was elected to Congress in 1973 -- to the seat left vacant when her husband, Hale Boggs, was lost in a plane crash in Alaska -- and decided to get out in 1990 to help one of her daughters, Barbara Sigmund, who was then mayor of Princeton, N.J., fight cancer. (Lindy has two other well-known children: Cokie Roberts, the Washington journalist, and Tommy Boggs, the Washington lobbyist.) After the cancer won, Lindy moved back home to the French Quarter of New Orleans, claimed to be retired, then promptly joined the boards of just about 600 local charities. At the time, I was living just around the corner from her on Bourbon Street and stopped in a few times. One of these visits came the same evening that a presidential candidate named Bill Clinton was scheduled to pay Lindy a call. As it happened, it was also the same time the Gennifer Flowers story was breaking.</p>
        <p>The party that night at Lindy's house was a fund-raiser dressed up as an intimate gathering for a few old friends who might like to meet an attractive young politician. The decorous hum of a handful of New Orleans Democrats milling about Lindy's upstairs living room was punctuated by a riot in the downstairs hallway. Clinton had burst into the house in a blaze of television lights and a crush of reporters, all of whom wanted to confirm the precise details of his extramarital sex life. The reporters bayed for graphic details; Clinton, huge and pink, tried to shove past them to the party. The situation had spun out of control, when Lindy appeared at Clinton's side and took him by the arm. The mob went quiet: it takes some nerve to holler ''oral sex'' in the presence of a septuagenarian. Then Lindy did her usual trick. She told the reporters how happy she was that they had come to see her. She offered them refreshments. Refreshments! She might as well have tried to distract a pack of hounds with a cheese dip -- or so I thought. But suddenly, and inexplicably, the mood in that hallway changed. The hounds lost the scent, the baying ceased, the fox grinned and strolled on by.</p>
        <p>She is one of those people who seem to have been put on this earth to undermine attempts to generalize about politicians. During her two decades as a member of Congress, she was the one person in Washington it was against the rules not to like and who seemed, for her part, incapable of disliking others. Richard Nixon and George McGovern: both dear friends. She adored Jack Kennedy, and he, of course, adored her. She also adored Lyndon Johnson, and he, of course, adored her. When she ceased to be a Congressional wife and became a congresswoman, she said there was only one thing that bothered her about the new job: she would be forced to vote. How could you vote without voting against something? In most people, this approach to public life would seem spineless. In Lindy, it came across like a glimpse of an alternative, enchanted universe.</p>
        <p>And as political strategy it was just plain shrewd. At the same time she was making herself into one of the least controversial characters ever to occupy a Congressional seat, she was often getting her way. Susan Feeney, a reporter for The New Orleans Times-Picayune in the 80's, passed many hours outside closed-door meetings of the House Appropriations Committee, waiting to find out how many federal dollars Lindy had mysteriously directed to her constituents. ''Lindy would sashay out with whatever a city or the state wanted,'' Feeney recalls. ''I'd go up to these curmudgeons on the committee afterward and ask them: 'What is going on? How did she do that?' And they would become slightly flustered and say things like, 'We just can't say no to her.'''</p>
        <p>The one source who was never of any use to reporters who wanted to describe how Lindy had done what she had done was Lindy herself. According to her, it was always some gallant, wise congressman who deserved the credit. Bob Livingston, speaker of the House manque, who served with Lindy on the House Appropriations Committee, says, ''Different politicians have different techniques, but not many could get away with Lindy's technique.'' He laughs. ''It was 'Dahlin' this' and 'Sweetie that.' And she usually walked out with what she came in to get and never mentioned it again.''</p>
        <p>The lindy effect seems to be working in Rome, too. For instance, this year Pope John Paul II has beatified one New Orleanean, the Rev. Francis Xavier Seelos, and will canonize another, Mother Katharine Drexel. Up until now, outside of its professional football team, New Orleans has not been long on saints. In nearly 300 years it has manufactured exactly one. In this jubilee year, the pope will miraculously increase the number of sacred people for Lindy's former constituents to pray to. Perhaps not entirely by coincidence, Lindy, for many years, was on a church committee in New Orleans that was trying to persuade the Vatican to beatify Father Seelos. But when I asked her if Her Presence had anything to do with his beatification, she just said: ''Oh, dahlin', the Vatican makes all those decisions in private. And Father Seelos was such an easy choice.''</p>
        <p>When she said this, we were sitting in her office at the American Embassy at the Holy See, with its view of the Palatine Hill. She had spent nearly two hours avoiding an explanation of her job. It is a strange fact about Lindy Boggs that the two things she spends most of her time on -- politics and praying -- are the two things she least cares to discuss. (''Lindy's really from the old school that has pious faith,'' says the Rev. Christopher Nalty, a young priest studying at the Vatican who often appears on the ambassador's arm. ''You didn't really question it, or talk about it. You just had it.'') Still, I couldn't help wondering, What does an ambassador to the Vatican do all day?</p>
        <p>Actually, that was the wrong question. What Lindy did with most of her days in Rome had already become clear. She went to the endless parties and meetings of cardinals and archbishops and the other ambassadors and invited all the same people to her own parties and meetings. Wherever she went, five Italian policemen with machine guns followed. Her schedule was as merciless as a New Orleans debutante's. Each day between 10 in the morning and midnight she seemed to pause only once, briefly, to send a cable or two back to the State Department in Washington, where it was read by a foreign-service officer whom Lindy had never met.</p>
        <p>But how did she fill up all those cables? It was this that she did not care to discuss. And there is not an intrusive question in the world for which Lindy Boggs does not have a charming anecdote with which to defuse it. Ask her, say, about the jockeying among cardinals to see who gets to be the next pope, and she'll reply with a funny story of a lunch she had with Ronald Reagan. ''My mother is uncharmingly discreet,'' Cokie Roberts says. ''All those years I was a reporter on Capitol Hill, and she never told me a damn thing.''</p>
        <p>At any rate, after a few hours of listening to delightful and charming stories about former heads of state, it dawned on me. ''The whole point of your job here,'' I said, ''is to avoid controversy.''</p>
        <p>''Which I have been doing my whole life!''</p>
        <p>The Embassy at the Holy See, which Reagan established in 1983, would seem at first glance to be a textbook case of the Pointless Embassy. There is almost nothing the United States can do to shape Vatican policy. Vatican theology, on which much Vatican policy rests, is officially off limits to the U.S. ambassador. Moreover, the Vatican may be the least concerned of all nations about what the United States wants it to do. When the pope decides to air his opinion that cancer can be caused by ''certain sexual behavior,'' as he did last year, the United States does not even bother to try to stop him. To do so would be worse than pointless. It would risk incurring the wrath of the one man outside the United States who, with a flick of his wrist, could wreak havoc with U.S. public opinion.</p>
        <p>As a result, much of what constitutes Vatican diplomacy is actually appeasement. ''Part of the job,'' admits one official at the United States Embassy at the Vatican, ''is to put the best possible face on the inevitable.''</p>
        <p>But there is something else, too, and it is peculiar to the Embassy at the Holy See. The information that flows into the Vatican from missionaries and churches -- perhaps the world's most elaborate news-gathering network -- is information the State Department would like to possess. In the darkest days of the Bosnian war, for example, the Vatican had an intimate view of affairs in the Balkans. Now it has perhaps the closest thing available outside Congo and East Timor to the ear-to-the-ground story on the conflicts inside. And so the question for the American ambassador becomes: How do you get people inside the Vatican to tell you things?</p>
        <p>''The Vatican operates much like the U.S. government did right after World War II,'' Lindy says. ''The difference is that you can't override the pope's veto.'' What she means by this is that in both places the protocol is so arcane as to constitute a subject unto itself. Not long after she arrived, for instance, she attended a party at the Israeli Embassy. It teemed with Vatican officials and foreign-service professionals. The evening wore on, and Lindy grew tired, but no one seemed to be leaving, so she stayed put. Finally, in the wee hours, she turned to a fellow ambassador and asked, ''When do the parties usually end?''</p>
        <p>''Thank God, you asked!'' the ambassador replied. ''As you are the most senior person present, no one can leave until you do.''</p>
        <p>Protocol is the Esperanto of Vatican social life. It operates as a substitute to local custom and tends to be more elaborate in places where people have the least culturally in common. Vatican protocol is by itself of little interest. What is interesting is the way it is used to mask Vatican politics or, rather, to keep people out who don't belong. As one well-placed monsignor put it to me: ''How you communicate here is as important as what you communicate. Ambassador Boggs seems to know this instinctively.''</p>
        <p>It isn't until you stop thinking of Lindy as an emissary and start thinking of her as a seeker of Vatican secrets that you can see the sense in her social life. Perhaps coincidentally, perhaps not, she has befriended not merely the upper echelon of Vatican officials but also other ambassadors. One of her new dear friends is the Spanish ambassador, who, as the representative of the oldest embassy at the Vatican, enjoys a privileged access; another is the German ambassador, who, as it happens, is also privy to a lot of Vatican gossip.</p>
        <p>And the truth is that Lindy has at times behaved strangely for a woman who sees her job as merely one of avoiding controversy. Not long ago she got herself into trouble. The trouble began with a call from a politically headstrong bishop who had become a force for East Timorese independence from Indonesia. The bishop was in Rome for a visit and hoped for a private meeting with the American ambassador to discuss the U.S. position on East Timor. He asked Lindy that their meeting not be publicized. Lindy agreed. She told no one of her scheduled meeting. Not her superiors in the State Department. Not the cardinals in the Vatican. If she had, she most certainly would have never gotten to see the East Timorese bishop.</p>
        <p>On the appointed day, the bishop turned up at her front door with television cameras. Lindy looked out her window and realized that she had been sandbagged; implicitly she had just made some small endorsement of the East Timorese bishop. Lindy looked out in the streets and saw the journalists and realized that she had to go out and persuade them to leave, which she did.</p>
        <p>''How?'' I asked. I wondered if she had offered them refreshments.</p>
        <p>''I had to go out into the street and appeal to them as Cokie's mother to leave us alone to chat,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''Did they leave?''</p>
        <p>''Of course they did!''</p>
        <p>But by then it was too late: she was all over the newspapers and the television. She had gotten herself into trouble -- but what for? For a chance at the inside scoop from East Timor, which, by the way, she soon had, in the form of a nun on a cell phone.</p>
        <p>I considered the case of the East Timorese bishop. If she really regarded her job as simply avoiding controversy, why should she agree to see him? ''Did anybody from the State Department call to complain about what you did?'' I asked.</p>
        <p>She looked at me strangely. The thought had plainly never occurred to her.</p>
        <p>''Can you just do whatever you want here?'' I asked. What I didn't say but thought was, Have you set yourself up as a sort of freelance spy?</p>
        <p>She laughed. ''They're afraid to tell Mawmaw what she can't do,'' she said. And then, ''I didn't ask for this job to begin with!''</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most surprising fact about Lindy Boggs is that she can't sleep at night. She spends all day sincerely looking for little ways to make the world a better place and then spends all night staring at her ceiling. ''When she was in Congress, she was always tired,'' recalls her former legislative aide, Jan Schoonmaker. ''I used to schedule downtime for her because I knew she hadn't slept the night before. I'd ask her why, and she'd say that she was worrying. Or some constituent had called at 2 a.m. to ask why he hadn't got his Social Security check. I'd say, 'Lindy, you need an unlisted phone number.' And she'd say, 'But dahlin', then people wouldn't know how to find me at night.''</p>
        <p>It's a habit with her still. Our last meeting in Rome coincided with one of her many dinner parties. The last archbishop had gone, and she was running a fever, yet she insisted that I hang around. She had something to show me. We left the dining room decorated with Barbara's childhood portrait and entered the study, where the portrait of Hale, painted not long before his death, hangs over her desk. At her desk she handed me a yellow Post-It on which she had scribbled what she called ''my political interests.'' She's worried -- though, of course, she does not come right out and say it -- that I'm going to depict her as a sweet old lady who makes a lot of people happy but doesn't really serve any greater purpose. Her list read: Preservation, National Archives, Holocaust museum, Smithsonian, Children and Families, NASA. It may be the least controversial list of political interests ever created, offering only the tiniest sliver of her view of the world. I asked her about her long record of voting against abortion rights. ''Oh,'' she said, ''I've always been for life. But I never would have raised it as a political issue.''</p>
        <p>She still had an expectant air about her; the list wasn't the thing that she wanted to show me. She grabbed me by the arm and led me out to the bottom of her marble staircase. There on the banister rested a plain manila folder. She had placed it there before the dinner so that it would be at hand afterward. She opened it and extracted a stack of photographs. The pictures of her first meeting with the pope, when she presented him with her credentials. ''When you are with the Holy Father,'' she said, as she paged through them, lovingly, ''you feel you are in the presence of something. He's just pure . . . goodness.''</p>
        <p>It was an extraordinarily detailed sequence. Every move seemed to have been documented. As I paged through the photographs, Lindy described the ritual leading up to the papal encounter. She was picked up in the motorcade, whisked around St. Peter's Square, led past the saluting Swiss Guards, marched through rooms painted by Raphael and Michelangelo and finally, at length, into the antechamber of the room in which the pope works. When she finished, I realized she had once again spoken at great length, and had told me everything but what I wanted to know.</p>
        <p>''But Lindy,'' I asked, ''what did you and the pope talk about?''</p>
        <p>''Dahlin', that's private!''</p>
