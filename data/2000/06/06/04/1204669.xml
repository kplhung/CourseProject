        <p>Ground was broken last week for a $100 million, 400,000-square-foot retail redevelopment project in Port Chester's downtown waterfront area. Mayor Christine Korff said she liked ''to think of it as a mall turned inside out: the facades and entrances of the stores and businesses will face the street.''</p>
        <p>The area has been under consideration for redevelopment for 30 years. Once a thriving manufacturing spot, it declined as factories moved south, Ms. Korff said. In the early 1970's, the land was declared an urban renewal area. After failed attempts by other companies, G&amp;S Investors of Old Bethpage on Long Island presented a plan that the village approved.</p>

        <p>By next May, there will be a two-level Costco, like one in Brooklyn. By the end of 2001, there will also be a movie theater, a Stop 'N' Shop supermarket and a variety of clothing boutiques, bookstores and cafes. County Executive Andrew J. Spano has also proposed a waterfront promenade and marina with 110 boat slips.</p>
