        <p>LIKE a starting gun, the loudspeaker at the Douglas E. Grafflin Elementary School here burst forth with the announcement: ''Get your writing pencils ready. Get your writing packets ready. Here comes the prompt: what would you do to make the world a better place?''</p>
        <p>And like thoroughbreds at the track, they were off, hunched over notebooks or scratching away furiously with their pencils. Nor was the 15-minute exercise limited to students. Administrators, teachers, aides, secretaries -- everyone at the school -- spent 9:30 to 9:45 composing a response to the question.</p>

        <p>LIKE a starting gun, the loudspeaker at the Douglas E. Grafflin Elementary School here burst forth with the announcement: ''Get your writing pencils ready. Get your writing packets ready. Here comes the prompt: what would you do to make the world a better place?''</p>
        <p>And like thoroughbreds at the track, they were off, hunched over notebooks or scratching away furiously with their pencils. Nor was the 15-minute exercise limited to students. Administrators, teachers, aides, secretaries -- everyone at the school -- spent 9:30 to 9:45 composing a response to the question.</p>
        <p>''This is a project that was supported and planned by parents as well as staff,'' said Sel Shimmerlik, a teacher at the school, where for a week last month all 720 students and staff took part in the ''Write On'' program. Banners and buttons promoting the event were ubiquitous. Parents had received helpful hints to encourage their children's efforts. These included ideas like, ''Leave literary gifts in your child's writing spot. Include clippings from newspapers, cards, magazines, advertisements.'' Also, ''Children and parents can be encouraged to keep a journal,'' or ''Write poems, notes and personal cards together for special occasions and for no reason at all.''</p>
        <p>For Richard Udice, who teaches third grade and helped develop the program: ''This was a lot more than we thought it would be. Knowing that the entire school was writing, that everybody was thinking about writing and that hundreds and hundreds of different ideas were being generated at the same time was exciting.''</p>
        <p>Even kindergartners took part. In Jennifer Pollitt's class, where the children scrawled their invented spelling and told the teacher their ideas, one boy came up with ''Be fair'' before hurrying off to play in the block corner.</p>
        <p>In Mr. Udice's room, a recurrent theme was cleaning up the environment and taking care of Earth. Lauren Lubetsky, 9, wrote: ''To make the world a better place, I would do two things. I would make it so there were no wars. If that happened, no one would fight, and that would lead to world peace. The second thing I would do is clean up the environment. That way people and animals could breathe better.''</p>
        <p>Other questions had led to sometimes poignant responses. To the question, ''What would be a perfect day for you?'' one fifth grader wrote: ''I would go to the beach with my family. I would do this because we all like the beach. I don't spend much time with my family, especially my dad. He is always at work, on a business trip, or on his laptop doing work or checking his e-mail.''</p>
        <p>Grafflin's isn't the only approach to encourage student writing. The Edgemont school district recently sponsored a Friday night writing workshop for fourth and fifth graders, which took a more traditional approach, with writers visiting  schools to serve as role models. The evening, which had been financed with a $6,000 grant from the Edgemont Education Foundation, featured reporters, a book editor, television broadcasters, poets, advertising copywriters, sportswriters, comedy writers, authors and a speech writer, who offered students a chance to try  different kinds of writing.</p>
        <p>In Saragail Benjamin's workshop on comedy, the students sat around a table as if they were Seinfeld writers.  Brainstorming comic scenarios, the students fired back snappy rejoinders to implausible or potentially funny situations, testing one-liners and opening setups on their peers as well as on Ms. Benjamin.</p>
        <p>When one student timidly raised her hand and asked, ''Does spelling count?'' Ms. Benjamin said: ''The only thing that counts is that you think and have fun. When the ideas are coming, do whatever you have to do to get the ideas down before you forget. And believe me, you will forget. We won't say no to anything. We want to see what ideas generate ideas.''</p>
        <p>For Naomi Jagoda, a fifth grader, the evening was a good one.</p>
        <p>''There are no real wrong answers in writing,'' she said. ''You can take your imagination to another world.''</p>
