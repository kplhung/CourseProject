        <p>IN the centuries before the modern age, artists were commissioned to depict their life and times for posterity. Influenced by the patrons that commissioned them, the art they produced had a decided twist with regard to style and accuracy.</p>
        <p>Today artists offer alternative observations in an attempt to create a more acute and nonbiased awareness of the past as well as the present; this is the subject of two current shows at the Neuberger Museum of Art here, titled ''Whitfield Lovell: Portrayals'' and ''Carol Hamoy: Portraits of the Artists as Young Girls.''</p>
        <p>Lovell's charcoal drawings on assembled wood, which also incorporate found objects,  go a long way in understanding the position  of the African-American in early 20th century society. Working from black-and-white studio photographs of both his family and  unknown subjects from the 1900's to the 1940's, he creates representations of African-Americans that teeter between prideful or strong-willed, and distracted or careworn.</p>
        <p>''Libations'' (1998), a portrait of the artist's grandmother when she was in her 20's, is a depiction of a seated woman that is rendered on pine wall planks covered in layers of crusted paint and withered wall paper. On the floor, antique vessels, mostly water jugs and decanters, seem to wait and watch, as another suspended container pours out its imaginary contents.</p>
        <p>All of the people he draws look like ghostly after visions. It is as if the walls and the objects placed within the individual tableaux hold the spirit of the person depicted. In ''Libations,'' the vessel that hangs above the seated woman is perhaps the part of her life that she is living at the time of the photograph. That the artist has chosen utilitarian objects to represent various stages of her life brings to mind the archaic misconception that a black woman was meant to be a house servant and nothing more.</p>
        <p>The uneven and brittle surface that Mr. Lovell works on possesses a multitude of challenges for the artist. In ''Still'' (1999), the hands of the seated man are carefully drawn around a pesky knot while a protruding nail nearby further complicates the  task. One can also imagine that in drawing the features of a woman, the other figure in ''Still,'' Mr. Lovell was faced with problems when the weakened, timeworn paint flaked off as he drew, making it necessary periodically to redo certain areas.</p>
        <p>''Ansermar'' (1999) best illustrates Mr. Lovell's ability to create a powerful narrative by combining straight realism with symbolic geometry. The main boards, which look as if they are from a red barn, combine to form a simplified side view of a house.</p>
        <p>Buttressing this house-shape form from the floor, the artist positions six more boards. Besides the suggestion of support, the boards vaguely root the house to the earth, as if to say the lineage of the subjects is shattered and uncertain.</p>
        <p>''Dusk'' (1999) is one of the few examples where the subject, a young man, is more casually posed. Standing with his jacket open and his hands in his pockets, he looks animated, even confident. Upon closer inspection, one begins to see the vacated nail holes that run across his neck and below his pelvis as bullet holes. Here, the artist may be reminding us that in the early 20th century, upwardly mobile blacks were thought of as the ultimate threat to whites. The mound of coal, which can be viewed as demeaning, helps to drive this point home.</p>
        <p>In the second exhibition at the museum, Ms. Hamoy's installation deals with gender-based oppression. To each of the 100 small paper dresses suspended from the museum's ceiling, Ms. Hamoy adds a sepia- or umber-toned image of a female artist about the age of 5. This is meant to commemorate the approximate time that the artistic spirit in each of these women began to develop. Along the back wall, the artist has written out by hand, on the same type of yellowed paper that she used to fabricate the dresses,  the names of many female artists, including those depicted on the dresses.</p>
        <p>The individual images on each dress range from a messy ice cream eater to a girl dressed in Sunday-best clothes to another whose face beams beneath her star-shaped crown. Since the paper of the dresses is transparent, the ambient light of the room filters through each dress, giving the entire installation an ethereal glow. One assumes this radiance represents the visionary characteristic of all of the artists cited, while at the same time alluding to a sisterhood built on a shared strength.</p>
        <p>As visitors walk through the installation, a gentle change in the air current moves the dresses. This reminds us that artists react to and reflect the world around them through an internal filter.</p>
        <p>The effect of seeing these feather-light dresses hovering just so gives visitors a sense that art can be uplifting and powerful at the same time.</p>
        <p>''Whitfield Lovell: Portrayals'' ends Aug. 20. ''Carol Hamoy: Portraits of the Artists as Young Girls'' runs through July 2. For more information, the number to call is 251-6100.</p>
