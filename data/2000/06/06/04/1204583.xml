        <p>KPIX-TV reporter Bill Schechner letter disputes Andrea Thompson's view in May 21 article that television news should focus on human interest rather than basic reporting (S)</p>

        <p>In respect to Andrea Thompson's view that: ''If nine homes are consumed by a fire, that is the least important part of the story. The most important part is the families within. Where will they go; what will they do?'' [''A Sultry New Reporter for the Nightly News,'' May 21].</p>
        <p>I've been a reporter for 35 years, 28 of them on TV (public, commercial, local and network) and believe me, what we don't need is more about that family. What we could stand here in tube-land is basic reporting: what did the building code have to do with it? How long did it take the fire department to get there? And maybe even the old chestnut, what caused it?</p>

        <p>On my first job (at a paper in New Jersey), I sat next to a well-traveled rewrite man who once looked up at me and said: ''You know, kid, facts add a lot to any story.'' Pass it on.</p>
