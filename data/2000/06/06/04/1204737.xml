        <p>Re ''Women Seek Louder Voice as World Peacemakers'' (news article, May 28): In Somalia, women have been at the forefront of peacemaking efforts.</p>
        <p>In 1995, the Center for the Strategic Initiatives of Women brought more than 50 Somali women together to explore strategies for peace. These women formed a coalition of grass-roots organizations that crosses clan lines. Since then, the coalition has engaged in shuttle diplomacy between warring factions, conducted conflict-resolution training workshops, negotiated a hostage release and settled community disputes.</p>

        <p>Starting on Monday, the United Nations will be host to an international conference on women. Governments should acknowledge and support women's peace initiatives and integrate women into all levels of the peacemaking process.</p>
