        <p>A psychiatrist discharged from the Air Force after announcing that he was gay filed a lawsuit challenging a demand that he reimburse the government for the cost of his education: more than $70,000. Dr. John Hensala said he did not know he was homosexual in 1986 when he joined a Pentagon program that paid for a medical degree from Northwestern University. In return, he was to serve four years in the Air Force. But seven months before he was to begin active duty, Dr. Hensala told the Defense Department that he was gay. The Air Force said he did so to avoid serving.</p>
