        <p>WHEN the Supreme Court confronted its first Internet case three years ago, the justices received special training from their library staff. The lessons ''helped assure each of us that we knew how to use the Net and understood the technical matters at issue,'' Justice Stephen G. Breyer recalled a few weeks ago at a symposium on biomedical research in Cambridge, Mass.</p>
        <p>Thus empowered, the court went on in that case, Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, to produce a unanimous decision that struck down the Communications Decency Act on First Amendment grounds and established the primacy of free speech principles in cyberspace.</p>
        <p>Soon, the Microsoft -- antitrust case will be heading toward the Supreme Court -- although whether directly from Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's final federal district court ruling, expected this week, or after review by the Court of Appeals here remains to be seen. The court has gotten its collective feet wet, clearly, but in the world of platforms, applications, source codes and interfaces, familiarity may not be fluency.</p>
        <p>So the question remains: are the justices ready to swim?</p>
        <p>The answer is almost certainly yes, in the view of a broad consensus of antitrust experts and students of the court. Year in and year out, they pointed out, the justices manage to handle hard cases requiring substantial specialized knowledge across many fields. But the intersection of old law with new technology that the Microsoft case represents offers a special challenge that at least one expert cautioned could test the limits of the court's competence.</p>
        <p>Institutionally, the court remains a novice. The Supreme Court launched its first Web site (www.supremecourtus.gov) only two months ago, long after many other courts had established an Internet presence. A rather static venture that lets users read the court's opinions and check its calendar, it received one million hits in its first month, to the considerable surprise of officials.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, though Windows NT runs the court's computers, and the justices' law clerks are undoubtedly as computer savvy as other members of their generation, the justices themselves, who range from 52 to 80, all came of age at a time when doing legal research meant reaching for a book, not a mouse.</p>
        <p>Substantively, the Microsoft case presents layers of complexity -- not only the technology of the specific products at issue, but fiercely contested assumptions about the relationship between competition and innovation in the fast-changing technology marketplace. To be told that they hold the future of the information industry in their hands -- a point the briefs will undoubtedly try to impress on the justices -- would be more than a little daunting for anyone.</p>
        <p>STILL, in recent interviews, several people pointed to Judge Jackson as an example of the judicial ability to climb a steep learning curve. Whether or not they agreed with the trial judge's approach to the case, no one seemed to doubt that by the end of it, he had an impressive mastery of the subject.</p>
        <p>''Judge Jackson never founded a dot-com or acquired any special credentialing,'' observed John Shepard Wiley Jr., a professor of antitrust and intellectual property law at the University of California at Los Angeles. ''For 200 years, federal judges have had the brains and the motivation to deal with cases people might assume are beyond their competence. They are used to rolling up their sleeves.''</p>
        <p>Patent law, for example, ''puts incredible demands on generalist judges,'' Professor Wiley said, because new patents are by definition at the cutting edge of technology. ''You can have a degree in gene splicing, but if it's 10 years old, it's not worth much,'' he noted.</p>
        <p>One antitrust expert, Andrew I. Gavil of the Howard University Law School, noted that the justices regularly decided complex cases, in antitrust, food and drug law and many other fields requiring specialized knowledge. ''It's hubris to think that the Supreme Court can't figure this out,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''Of course,'' he added in a wry tone, ''it's not like Aspen Skiing'' -- a reference to an admittedly more accessible 15-year-old antitrust decision that found the owner of three mountains in Colorado to have maintained an illegal monopoly by refusing to deal with the owner of a fourth mountain.</p>
        <p>The Microsoft case presents ''interesting legal issues, but not unique ones,'' Professor Gavil said, noting that at the heart of the case are antitrust principles with which the court is completely familiar. ''What Microsoft did with its monopoly and how the law treats that is not that complex,'' he said. ''Did it have a pro-competitive justification, or did it engage in behavior that cost it something in the short run in order to hinder its rivals in the long run? That's a very conventional antitrust question.''</p>
        <p>The aspect of the Microsoft case that most closely combines law and technology, Professor Gavil said, is whether Microsoft's bundling of its Internet browser with its Windows operating system was an illegal tying arrangement.</p>
        <p>JUDGE Jackson -- who earlier in the case conducted his own experiment, disabling Internet Explorer on his own computer in 90 seconds -- ruled that it was in his April conclusions of law.</p>
        <p>''But on that, the justices will be able to use pretty standard doctrine,'' Professor Gavil said. ''You don't have to be able to read source code to know what you see on the screen when you turn on your computer. If you know that there are programs that can be downloaded from the Internet, you've gone pretty far toward being able to understand the government's theory.''</p>
        <p>The broader question of how judges deal with the substantive complexity of the cases before them has been a subject of growing interest, much of it revolving around the capacity of so-called junk science to sway impressionable jurors. In an important 1993 decision, Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, the Supreme Court reinterpreted the federal rules of evidence to require judges to serve as gatekeepers, weeding out bad science and preventing unqualified ''experts'' from testifying.</p>
        <p>The Daubert case and two subsequent Supreme Court cases that elaborated on it have spawned a whole body of law, still a work in progress and all of it judge-made.</p>
        <p>To cite just one example, federal appeals courts are split over how to assess the reliability of a doctor's testimony about a differential diagnosis -- the conclusion that a plaintiff's symptoms are caused by one medical condition and not another. Some courts allow testimony that reflects standard clinical practice, while others reject testimony not based on published scientific studies. The Supreme Court may eventually feel obliged to resolve the dispute, as well as others stemming from the Daubert case.</p>
        <p>''We rely on judges who are generalists, and judges learn what they need to learn,'' said Richard M. Cooper, a Washington lawyer who has argued many technically complex cases since his days as general counsel for the Food and Drug Administration. Most recently, he won a Supreme Court case on behalf of the tobacco industry against his former agency's effort to regulate cigarettes as drug delivery devices.</p>
        <p>''The parties and friends of the court briefs educate the judges,'' Mr. Cooper said. ''The lawyer's job is to marshal the relevant science, economics and technical information in a manner that an intelligent lay person can understand.</p>
        <p>''That's our system, and it's a useful discipline,'' he added. ''The Endangered Species Act, for example. Are we really wiping out that rare species? How do we know?'' For the Microsoft case, he said, ''if it's something economists can understand and explain to lawyers, lawyers can explain it to the court.''</p>
        <p>Cass R. Sunstein, a University of Chicago law professor whose recent book on the Supreme Court, ''One Case at a Time'' (Harvard University Press, 1999), commends an incremental approach to deciding hard cases, was one hesitant voice who warned that the Microsoft case might indeed lie at the outer limits of the court's institutional competence.</p>
        <p>In an interview, he noted that antitrust cases, unlike most other cases of equivalent complexity, go to court in raw form, without having been predigested by an administrative agency with special expertise.</p>
        <p>''When a court is stuck with a technically complex case, it can usually turn to strategies of avoidance,'' Professor Sunstein said. ''In administrative law, you defer to the agency. A real development of 20th century law was the shift from judicial to administrative lawmaking. We don't have the common law of nuisance; we have the E.P.A. We don't have the common law of fraud; we have the F.T.C.''</p>
        <p>But in antitrust, essentially common law constructed by judges from the Sherman Act's cryptic phrases, the strategy of avoidance ''is not available,'' he said. Without an expert agency to defer to, explained Professor Sunstein, judges cannot take the path of least resistance -- that is, ''letting specialists make the first-line decisions, subject to review by generalists for some sign of arbitrariness or unfairness.''</p>
        <p>In the Microsoft context, he said, that leaves the court without much of a lifeline as it navigates uncharted territory. ''To the extent that this case can be resolved on standard antitrust doctrine, the facts are pretty straightforward,'' Professor Sunstein said. ''What's messy is to figure out how to apply antitrust when technology and the market are both changing rapidly.''</p>
        <p>AMONG the justices, no one has given more thought to the relationship between law and science than Justice Breyer, who also happens to have taught antitrust at Harvard Law School.</p>
        <p>''I believe that in this age of science, we must build legal foundations that are sound in science, as well as in law,'' he said in a 1998 speech to the American Association for the Advancement of Science, which he praised for a study on expanded roles for court-appointed experts.</p>
        <p>More recently, in his speech last month at the Cambridge biomedical research symposium, Justice Breyer said the view that Supreme Court justices ''need not know science but only law to make decisions'' was ''increasingly unrealistic.''</p>
        <p>The challenge of ''creating a generalist voice that will speak for an age of specialization,'' he said, was ''difficult to accomplish, but it is important to try.''</p>
