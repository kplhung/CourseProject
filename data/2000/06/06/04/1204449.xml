        <p>And Bear in Mind  (Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)</p>
        <p>AMERICAN DAUGHTER: Discovering My Mother, by Elizabeth Kendall. (Random House, $23.95.) Kendall's examination of her own story and her family's story is illuminated by reflection from her mother, who left Vassar to bear and raise six children, a course now hard to imagine.</p>
        <p>THE BINDING CHAIR: Or, A Visit From the Foot Emancipation Society, by Kathryn Harrison. (Random House, $24.95.) A resonant, elaborately constructed novel that renders the lives of two women, an aunt deformed physically and morally by tradition and her overtly rebellious niece.</p>
        <p>DARWIN'S WORMS, by Adam Phillips. (Basic Books, $20.) Meditations by a London psychotherapist on Darwin's lifelong study of earthworms and Freud's exemplary command of death and its uses, finding in both cause for celebration in a world abandoned by God.</p>
        <p>ENGLISH PASSENGERS, by Matthew Kneale. (Nan A. Talese/Doubleday, $25.) A grim but hilarious historical novel involving the extinction of the Tasmanians, a search for the Garden of Eden and a Manx contrabandist who conceals his smuggling from the passengers on his ship.</p>
        <p>EXPERIENCE, by Martin Amis. (Talk Miramax/ Hyperion, $23.95.) The novelist's nonfictional coming-of-age narrative, dense with personal history, firm opinions, literary gossip, name-dropping, wild regret, activist dentistry and Amis's father, Kingsley Amis.</p>
        <p>THE HUMAN STAIN, by Philip Roth. (Houghton Mifflin, $26.) The novel's doomed protagonist is a modern converso: a black man passing as a Jew so he'll be taken for white; our old friend Nathan Zuckerman tells his story.</p>
        <p>NEWJACK: Guarding Sing Sing, by Ted Conover. (Random House, $24.95.) A journalist's account of his year as a correction officer, where his moral well-being was as much at risk as his bodily safety.</p>
        <p>THE OTHER AMERICAN: The Life of Michael Harrington, by Maurice Isserman. (PublicAffairs, $28.50.) An appealing biography of an appealing man, a Socialist and a Democrat, whose 1963 book, ''The Other America,'' recognized the obscured depth and dimensions of poverty in this country.</p>
        <p>PASTORALIA: Stories, by George Saunders. (Riverhead, $22.95.) The author's second story collection focuses on the American urge for self-improvement, the fear of failure, the need to be accepted. Generally speaking, his characters don't stand the ghost of a chance.</p>
        <p>THE WATER IN BETWEEN: A Journey at Sea, by Kevin Patterson. (Nan A. Talese/Doubleday, $23.95.) A bored Canadian doctor, 29, conceives the idea of sailing to Tahiti in a small boat. He does so, and lives. He writes this book. It is really quite charming and instructive. Lucky guy!</p>
