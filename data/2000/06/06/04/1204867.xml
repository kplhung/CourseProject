        <p>Hockey has an element of chess to it. And tonight, the initial move belonged to Dallas Stars Coach Ken Hitchcock.</p>
        <p>The end game, however, belonged to New Jersey Coach Larry Robinson as the Devils rode Jason Arnott's line to a 2-1 victory in Game 3 of the Stanley Cup finals. The Devils lead by two games to one in the four-of-seven-game series.</p>
        <p>In hockey, the home team is allowed to make the last change during any stoppage on the ice. During the first two games of the series at Continental Arena in New Jersey, Robinson decided that he liked the matchup of his top line, centered by Arnott, against the Stars' top line, centered by Mike Modano.</p>
        <p>The move had mixed results. In Game 1, the Arnott line, with Patrik Elias and Petr Sykora on the wings, accounted for four goals in the Devils' 7-3 rout. But Modano's line, with Brett Hull and Jere Lehtinen, struck back for a pair of goals from Hull in Game 2, when Dallas evened the series with a 2-1 victory.</p>
        <p>''I think it will be that way for the rest of the series,'' Modano said after Game 2, referring to matching up against Arnott's lines. ''It kind of fit into our plan.''</p>
        <p>But it was not the Stars' plan at Reunion Arena tonight, when they had the chance to dictate the moves. Modano's line played mainly against the Devils' line centered by Scott Gomez.</p>
        <p>''We need a better advantage,'' Hitchcock said. ''There's no point breaking even at home.''</p>
        <p>But that is the best the Stars can hope for now in their first two games at home. And Modano sounded as if he did not altogether agree with Hitchock's move.</p>
        <p>''We felt after Game 2 that would be a definitive mathcup,'' Modano said. ''There were some times that we were against them. But it wasn't as consistent as Game 2.''</p>
        <p>Even Arnott was surprised.</p>
        <p>''I figured we'd be playing against them a little more,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But after the Stars took a 1-0 lead, 13 minutes 8 seconds into the first period, on an unassisted goal by Sylvain Cote with Modano's line out on the ice, Hitchcock turned to his checking line, centered by Guy Carbonneau, and asked it to shadow Arnott's line. Carbonneau's line, with Kirk Muller and Blake Sloan (who was later replaced by Mike Keane), proved to be much too slow.</p>
        <p>Hull, the Stars' top sniper, was invisible for most of the game. The only two truly good scoring opportunities he had -- one early in the game, the other in the final minute -- were snuffed out by Martin Brodeur, the Devils' goalie.</p>
        <p>Arnott's line proved to be the best line on the ice tonight. Arnott scored the tying goal, at 18:06 of the first, after Carbonneau had left his teammates momentarily shorthanded -- the 40-year-old center had skated to the bench for an impromptu change because he had been hit in the face with a stick.</p>
        <p>Arnott seized on the opportunity, jumped on a loose puck, split Derian Hatcher and Dave Manson at the top of the slot, and beat Dallas goalie Ed Belfour with a forehand shot to tie the score -- all while Arnott was falling to the ice.</p>
        <p>The Devils took a 2-1 lead at 11:03 of the second period on a 55-foot slap shot by Sykora from just inside the blue line that skittered off the webbing of Belfour's glove and into the net. That gave the Arnott line both of the Devils' goals. Arnott had the primary assist.</p>
        <p>Once Dallas fell behind, Hitchcock changed his plan altogether, moving the rookie Brenden Morrow into Lehtinen's place on Modano's line. For much of the final period, Modano's revamped line skated against Arnott's. Unlike in Game 2, Arnott's line prevailed.</p>
        <p>''We controlled the puck a lot,'' Scott Stevens, the Devils' captain, said about his team's efforts to shut down the Modano line. ''We didn't give them a whole lot of chances. We kept the puck in on them. I think that was the difference tonight.''</p>
        <p>Between games, Modano had said: ''We made the decision that our line is going to play against Jason's the rest of the series. We definitely will be able to get that matchup better in Dallas.''</p>
        <p>They could have had it any time they wanted tonight.</p>
