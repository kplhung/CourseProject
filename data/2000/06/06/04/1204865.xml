        <p>The Liberty players practically passed the Knicks in the hallway of Madison Square Garden yesterday morning, so early were they arriving to work. More than two hours before the tip-off in the Liberty's 1 p.m. home opener against Utah, at an hour of the morning when the Liberty players would usually be having a leisurely cup of coffee and a doughnut on their way to work, they were already watching film. The players, seeking their first victory of the season after two losses on the road, were desperately trying to squeeze in a few more seconds of preparation for teammates who might need name tags to identify each other.</p>
        <p>What came out of the cram session was simple: the Liberty would run three plays on offense, Coach Richie Adubato told them, and would press Utah early and often on defense, to create easy scoring opportunities off turnovers and wear out the Starzz, which had flown in Friday after a late game Thursday night.</p>

        <p>The Liberty players practically passed the Knicks in the hallway of Madison Square Garden yesterday morning, so early were they arriving to work. More than two hours before the tip-off in the Liberty's 1 p.m. home opener against Utah, at an hour of the morning when the Liberty players would usually be having a leisurely cup of coffee and a doughnut on their way to work, they were already watching film. The players, seeking their first victory of the season after two losses on the road, were desperately trying to squeeze in a few more seconds of preparation for teammates who might need name tags to identify each other.</p>
        <p>What came out of the cram session was simple: the Liberty would run three plays on offense, Coach Richie Adubato told them, and would press Utah early and often on defense, to create easy scoring opportunities off turnovers and wear out the Starzz, which had flown in Friday after a late game Thursday night.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the plan, simplistic as it was, worked to perfection. The Liberty raced to an 11-point lead, scored 27 points off 18 turnovers and got clutch shooting from two veterans, Vickie Johnson (19 points) and Becky Hammon (23 points), to beat Utah, 87-76. With three of its next four games on the road -- where the Liberty staggered to a 6-10 record last season -- the Liberty was able to breathe a sigh of relief usually reserved for late-season games with a playoff berth on the line.</p>
        <p>''This was huge,'' said point guard Teresa Weatherspoon, who had 8 points and 7 assists to offset 5 turnovers. ''This was a big win for us to build confidence.''</p>
        <p>Stung by injuries, the Liberty had two new players in the lineup. The rookie forward Shea Mahoney, who expected to be cut in training camp, was pressed into action when the Liberty's best shooter, Crystal Robinson, went down with a severe ankle sprain last week. Center Tari Phillips, who joined the team through a trade only a week ago, is starting because the Liberty's low post is better represented on the injured list than on the floor.</p>
        <p>The schedule will not help the Liberty. The team flew to Washington after the game, where it will face the Mystics this afternoon. But at least the Liberty (1-2) went on the road  with the knowledge that despite its depleted roster, there were still a few people who could be relied upon. While Hammon's shooting was critical, it was the re-emergence of Vickie Johnson that surely soothed a few nerves. She was scoreless against Houston in the season opener and hit just 4 of 13 shots against Phoenix, a dispiriting start, especially given the expected absence of Robinson for several weeks.</p>
        <p>Yesterday Johnson's defense complemented her unearthed shot. She had four steals in the game's first six minutes and she made 6 of 11 shots, none more critical than the one that came midway through the second half. The Liberty had scored only 6 points in the half's first eight minutes and the Starzz had crept back within 3. But Johnson, standing alone in the left corner, sank a 3-pointer with 12 minutes 1 second left and the Liberty never led by fewer than 6 points after that.</p>
        <p>''That was the biggest shot of the game without a doubt,'' said forward Sue Wicks, who had 5 points and 4 rebounds. ''We were in a drought at the time. That gave us a sense of control. I felt that was the win.''</p>
