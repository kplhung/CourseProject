        <p>Whoever stole the 20-by-10-foot mural from the former Long Island Savings Bank in Long Island City was smooth.</p>
        <p>On April 30, two men walked into the marble-lined lobby of the Greek Revival building, which was undergoing renovations to turn it into a discotheque. They mentioned an employee's name and said they had been told to remove the work from the wall.</p>
        <p>''They even used my scaffold to get it down,'' John Korkas, the renovations manager, said incredulously.</p>
        <p>Leon Nektalov, who owns the building, at 29-11 Queens Plaza North, quickly notified the police. But it was Michael Mannetta, a postal worker, who brought the theft to the attention of the Greater Astoria Historical Society.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mannetta walked into the lobby daily during his rounds. Seeing the painting was a bright spot in his day. ''It kept bothering me, and I acted too late,'' he said remorsefully, remembering that he had worried that the recent renovations might damage the work. ''I just didn't think anyone would have the nerve to go in and take it. It's so large.''</p>
        <p>The mural was painted by Vincent Aderente, who came to the United States from Naples in the late 1800's and lived in Bayside, Queens, until his death in 1941 at the age of 61. Aderente believed in beautifying public buildings, and painted large colorful pieces, two of which hang in the Detroit Public Library and the Denver Mint.</p>
        <p>The missing mural was copyrighted in 1939 by the Long Island Savings Bank, which used the image to promote its branch. The panorama depicts, from bottom to top, a 350-year history of Long Island City, starting with images of local, Maspeth Indians. They are followed by the Jackson Water Mill, which dates from the Dutch period. British Redcoats from the Revolutionary War march through the middle of the painting, and above them is farmland, a horse-drawn bus from the old Blue Line and a manufacturing plant. The Queensborough Bridge stretches across the top of the work, its crowning glory.</p>
        <p>Police investigators agreed that the theft sounded like an inside job and told Mr. Nektalov there was a good chance of recovering the painting because of its size. But after nearly a month, the mural is still missing.</p>
        <p>The Greater Astoria Historical Society is offering a $500 reward for information leading to its recovery, and Mr. Nektalov is offering an additional $1,000. He has also worked out an agreement with the Historical Society under which the public would be allowed to view the work for a few months each year if it is recovered.</p>
        <p>Although Queens is physically the city's largest borough, it has the fewest landmarks, and thus the mural is especially treasured, said Bob Singleton, a member of the Historical Society's board.</p>
        <p>''If there's anything good that can come from this, it's that people from the neighborhood worked together,'' Mr. Singleton said. ''They took our identity as a community, and we want it back.''</p>
        <p>But for now there's a long unpainted rectangular space on the wall where the work hung for more than six decades.</p>
        <p>It pains Mr. Mannetta.</p>
        <p>''That painting should definitely be in a museum,'' he said. ''The kids could go and get a quick history lesson. To lose something like this would be really, really sad.''</p>
