        <p>FOLLOWING the flourishing career path of Phil Collins, another classic rock drummer who left a superstar band to find great success as a solo act, Don Henley etched out a solo career that was both commercially and creatively auspicious.</p>
        <p>The most successful former member of the Eagles, the silk-and-sand-voiced Mr. Henley has returned after a 10-year recording hiatus, releasing his fourth album, ''Inside Job,'' and beginning to tour.</p>
        <p>The Eagles, one of America's most influential bands, inspired a generation of rock and country artists with their amalgam of musical styles. They broke up in 1982 and Mr. Henley immediately found success with his solo album ''I Can't Stand Still'' and its gossip-bashing single ''Dirty Laundry.'' The following year, he enjoyed further commercial fortune with ''Building the Perfect Beast,'' which boasted four Top 10 singles including the nostalgic ''Boys of Summer'' and ''All She Wants to Do Is Dance.'' His 1989 album, the wry ''End of Innocence,'' also generated a string of hits, like ''New York Minute,'' ''The Heart of the Matter'' and the title track.</p>
        <p>Mr. Henley's Sting-like soulful voice and yearning songs struck a chord with fans. But he, like his fans, matured, and his themes headed toward reconciliation and redemption, culminating in the commanding ballad ''The Heart of the Matter,'' which appeared on ''Innocence.''</p>
        <p>At age 52, he has come to an emotional crossroads on his new album. Musically, it might sound close enough to the 11-year-old ''Innocence,'' but lyrically this is a whole new man. He almost excuses his new-found tranquillity. ''I hate to tell you this,'' he sings in ''Everything Is Different Now,'' ''but I'm very happy now.''</p>
        <p>On his current tour, anyone wanting to hear Eagles songs will have to sit through 17 others before he gets to ''Life in the Fast Lane.'' And even at that it is deconstructed into a semi-rapped rail. But when called back for his encore, he shows his gratitude by ripping into an undulating horn-backed ''Hotel California,'' along with ''Wasted Time, the Long Run'' and ''Desperado.'' Some might think that the encores alone are worth the trip.</p>
        <p>Mr. Henley, who defined the California sound of the 1970's, is a Texan and has returned to live in Dallas. His country roots often reveal themselves. He was always a class act, and as he stands on stage forgoing his guitar, passionately presenting his songs with intense capacity, it is a spellbinding concert experience. His sweet, yet gritty voice, soaked in rhythm and blues, imbues the mostly midtempo songs with potency and sophistication.</p>
        <p>He performs with a large ensemble including a 7-piece rock band, a 12-member chorus, 7-man brass section, and both a string and trombone quartet.</p>
        <p>He opens his show with the early songs ''Dirty Laundry'' and ''Sunset Grill,'' then moves seamlessly to the new material. The new songs range from the luxuriant ballad ''Taking You Home'' to the offbeat rocker ''They're Not Here, They're Not Coming,'' which tells the U.F.O.-watchers to get over it, the aliens are not arriving.</p>
        <p>For those who cannot afford the $85 ticket price (he has 35 onstage mouths to feed), there is always the new album. Despite the record's pervading uplifting sentiment, there are several dark inclusions, as well as several topical ones. ''Workin' It'' gets the Seattle World Trade Organization juices burning as it attacks ''corporation nation-states'' and commercialization. ''Goodbye to a River,'' brings out the environmental activist Mr. Henley has become. More important, he pulls off one of the most difficult songwriting stunts -- writing topical material that doesn't come off as pedantic or trite.</p>
        <p>''Miss Ghost,'' a song worthy of Bob Dylan, is sleek and inviting, like the specter of the former lover he sings about. There is an all-consuming ballad ''Damn It, Rose'' (reminiscent of Mick Jagger singing ''Wild Horses''), in which he quietly unleashes the emotional turmoil and frustration surrounding a friend's suicide. And he soon turns to the rousing ''My Thanksgiving,'' a song of grace sounding as if it were torn straight from his diary.</p>
        <p>The album is a beauty to listen to. Mr. Henley remains one of the most distinctive voices in American music, always getting to the heart of the matter in a soulful, thoughtful way.</p>
        <p>DON HENLEY</p>
