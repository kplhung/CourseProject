        <p>Everyone knows by now that Jon Corzine's personal spending on his campaign for the United State Senate primary on Tuesday has dwarfed any previous records in the state, including personal money that his rival for the Democratic nomination, Jim Florio, has made.</p>

        <p>Everyone knows by now that Jon Corzine's personal spending on his campaign for the United State Senate primary on Tuesday has dwarfed any previous records in the state, including personal money that his rival for the Democratic nomination, Jim Florio, has made.</p>
        <p>But if Mr. Corzine is the wealthiest candidate running, he is hardly the only prosperous contender liberally sprinkling his own money along the campaign trail. Stung by Mr. Florio's charges that the former financier is trying to buy his Senate seat, some of Mr. Corzine's supporters are starting to argue for a proportional view of personal campaign spending. If Mr. Corzine's millions are too much, they ask Mr. Florio, how much is acceptable?</p>
        <p>Here's how this argument works: Mr. Corzine has said that a fair estimate of his personal wealth was $400 million, and he had, through the May 17 preprimary reporting period, put $20,272,000 of his own money into the campaign, or about 5 percent of his personal fortune.</p>
        <p>Mr. Florio, a former governor and a lawyer in private practice since 1993, has hardly been a slouch when it comes to opening the family checkbook. He has contributed $1.23 million of his own money to his campaign, according to the Election Commission reports.</p>
        <p>Mr. Florio and his wife, Lucinda, reported an adjusted gross income of $528,599 last year, though unlike Mr. Corzine, he has not offered an estimate of his total net worth. Applying the Corzine 5 percent contribution standard, however, Mr. Florio would would have to have a fortune of more than $18 million for his spending to be proportionate to that of his opponent. Since that is unlikely, Corzine supporters say Mr. Florio is actually spending more of his fortune than his far wealthier opponent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Florio's campaign disputes this argument entirely, in part because they believe Mr. Corzine is worth more than $400 million.</p>
        <p>''We think he is closer to a billionaire,'' said a Florio spokesman, Jim Lanard.</p>
        <p>Whatever the facts, Mr. Corzine and Mr. Florio are hardly the only prosperous candidates pitching their own money into the primary campaign. Take the race for the Seventh Congressional District, where four Republicans and four Democrats are competing for the seat being vacated by Representative Bob Franks, who is seeking the Republican nomination for the senate.</p>
        <p>Mike Ferguson, the young educator who was the unsuccessful Republican challenger in the Sixth Congressional District two years ago, lent $218,000 to his planned campaign last year before he switched to the Seventh, taking his money with him. But Mr. Ferguson was surpassed by one of the Democrats in the race, Maryanne Connelly, a former mayor of Fanwood, who put in $144,600 through March, and has lent $88,000 more since then.</p>
        <p>There are other examples: Assemblyman Joel Weingarten, running in the Republican primary, has contributed $148,000, and Tom Kean Jr., the son of the former governor, has lent his congressional campaign $152,000.</p>
        <p>In contrast to Mr. Corzine and Mr. Florio, the Republican candidates in the Senate primary race are comparatively tight-fisted. The biggest spender is Murray Sabrin, the former Libertarian, who has kicked in $74,000 of his own money. Mr. Franks has contributed only $5,000 of his own money, while State Senator Bill Gormley has given just $2,000. The fourth candidate, Jim Treffinger, the Essex County executive, had not contributed anything to his campaign by the May 26 reporting deadline.</p>
        <p>The personal wealth of candidates is hardly the only measure of fund-raising success. According to an analysis of campaign contributions to the Senate candidates by New Jersey Public Interest Research Group, which advocates stricter controls on campaign spending, 71 percent of all contributions to the  Senate campaign were the maximum $1,000 amount. Mr. Corzine led the pack with 84 percent of his donations coming in at $1,000, the research group's analysis showed, while 84 percent of Mr. Gormley's contributions were at the limit, and Mr. Franks were at 61 percent. Mr. Florio's $1,000 contribution rate was about the same as Mr. Franks's at 60 percent.</p>
        <p>Julia Hutchins of the research group maintains that the demand for money in campaigns like New Jersey's clearly discourage many potential candidates from even thinking about running for higher office.</p>
        <p>For instance, Tom Byrne, a former chairman of the state Democratic Party, said he dropped out of the Senate race when he became convinced Mr. Corzine would make a fine senator, but he conceded that his contributions dried up after the campaign began in earnest.</p>
        <p>If the ability to raise money trumps all the other considerations in running for office, Ms. Hutchins said, ''I think there is a real danger that those who make it to the top will focus on reflecting the views of those who made their campaigns possible, and not the views of ordinary grass-roots citizens.''</p>
