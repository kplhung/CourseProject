        <p>THERE will, I'm afraid, be no Jersey column this week. It's a pity, really, because I had several compelling subjects I might have written about. But no one called me back.</p>
        <p>I should explain that -- although this embarrasses us journalists -- much of what you read in your Sunday morning paper was not in fact written Sunday morning, or even Saturday night. It was written days ago, because when a paper is as fat as this one it takes a long time to print.</p>
        <p>Thus today's column would have been written a week ago, over Memorial Day weekend. In the days leading up to that weekend I had several ideas percolating. And I made several phone calls, seeking to nail down one idea or another. But that Friday, you'll recall, was the first sunny day we'd had in, what, a month? And being a Friday, and a getaway day to a holiday weekend, well, no one called me back.</p>
        <p>Had the right call come I might, for instance, have written a dandy column about shore birds. One of New Jersey's most wondrous natural spectacles is winding down right about now, involving migrating birds like the red knot, which, incredibly, flies from South America to the Arctic Circle, stopping briefly on our state's southern shores to chow down on horseshoe crab eggs.</p>
        <p>Scientists have been worried for several years that crab fishing and other human activity is jeopardizing this amazing cycle. A few weeks ago Larry Niles of the state Department of Environmental Protection told me by e-mail that early returns from the annual bird count were raising concerns, and that researchers were trying to figure out whether the birds were in trouble, had simply gone elsewhere, or what.</p>
        <p>I had hoped to hear more, maybe arrange to go out with a bird-banding group. But nobody called me back. Finally, on Saturday of the holiday weekend, I drove down to Moore's Beach in Cumberland County, hoping to find the spectacle myself. But locating the elusive birds takes a naturalist's knowledge, and there was nothing on the beach but a few ratty seagulls.</p>
        <p>Too bad, because I had some interesting tidbits I would have folded into the column. Sue Canale at the Tuckahoe Wildlife Management Area, for instance, told me there was excitement there because some piping plovers, an endangered bird in the state, had set a record for early nesting, so early that there were hopes the birds would produce a second clutch of eggs this season (and yes, bird-types call this double-clutching). I would have made profound points about how the battle to protect the vastness of nature comes down to individual people counting individual eggs and birds. But it was not to be.</p>
        <p>I might, too, have written a totally unrelated column about the quaint little Natural History Museum in Guyot Hall at Princeton, and one woman's battle to save it. It's a small, quirky museum in a lovely high-ceilinged space, with dinosaur bones and a working seismograph and dead eels floating in jars. It's the antithesis of the buzzy, busy, Imax-y museums now in vogue, sort of a museum of a museum. And that somehow makes it all the more compelling.</p>
        <p>Robin M. Martin, Princeton class of '75, remembers being stuck there during a rainstorm when she was 4, and being enthralled -- so much so that the subject drew her back when she became a student. That's why she is dismayed that the university has plans to pack away the exhibits and turn the space into offices.</p>
        <p>Ms. Martin, who now runs the Santa Fe New Mexican, a weekly newspaper, was back on campus for her 25th reunion the other day, but she didn't get very festive; she was too busy lobbying to spare the museum.</p>
        <p>''People have described this place as Victorian,'' she said, giving me a tour, ''and it is. That's what's so neat about it. It's a window on the history of science at Princeton.''</p>
        <p>Some exhibitions, she has been told, will end up in a new atrium that's being built nearby, and others may be sprinkled around the campus -- spaces that may not be healthy for million-year-old bones and won't exactly invite viewing by elementary school groups. That bothers her. So does the thought of even more of ancient Guyot Hall being eaten by drab offices.</p>
        <p>''This is really the best, highest use of this space,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But this saga, too, will not be told here, because when I called the provost's office for comment, confirmation, etc., no one called me back. I can hardly do a one-sided column.</p>
        <p>So, as I said, there will be no Jersey column this week. But who cares? Summer's here. Take the phone off the hook.</p>
