        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Like the Phoenix, the state fire museum is coming back to life. When a longtime resident of Ocean Grove retired to Arkansas last year, he took with him a lifetime collection of fire memorabilia including 10,000 photos and slides. It bothered me that New Jersey didn't have a proper fire museum to offer a safe home to his  collection. Ironically, just such a museum was authorized by the State  Legislature in 1989, but after funds were withdrawn the project withered despite the donation of over 400 artifacts, including hand-drawn and horse-drawn fire apparatus.</p>
        <p>Admiring the success of the U.S.S. New Jersey project, I realized that a  similar effort might do the same for the fire museum. With some fresh initiative, the nonprofit fire museum  commission kicks off the charter membership fund drive next Saturday at the annual Lakehurst fire engine muster in Ocean County.  Among the sirens, pumping fire engines and childrens games, an 11 a.m. press conference will answer any questions about the project.</p>

        <p>Instead of planning just another relic museum we are including a ''fire science center'' to provide hands-on fire education for the public. With citizen membership and corporate sponsorship, we will construct this combined historic and educational center at Allaire State Park, near Parkway Exit 98. If you can't come to Lakehurst, call (732) 222-5783 or write to us at New Jersey State Fire Engine Museum, 175 Washington St., Long Branch, N.J. 07740.</p>
