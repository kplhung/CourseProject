        <p>CARDINAL JOHN O'CONNOR long dreamed of establishing an archive center for the Archdiocese of New York on the campus of St. Joseph's Seminary. And the sprawling 18,000-square-foot granite and limestone Archbishop John Hughes Archives and Heritage Center, scheduled to open here officially in the fall, is testament to Cardinal O'Connor's desire to provide a permanent repository for the documents, historical papers and artifacts of the parishes of New York over their nearly 200-year history.</p>
        <p>Last week, furniture arrived for what would have been the cardinal's office at the center, which he had planned to use after his retirement. ''The cardinal came by frequently to see how work was progressing,'' said the Rev. Brian McSweeney, vice chancellor of the archdiocese. ''He even continued to come when he was sick, shortly before he died.''</p>
        <p>The cardinal died of cancer in May, but his office at the center will be set up as planned, Father McSweeney said, although its use has not been determined. ''We'll wait to see what Archbishop Egan wants to do with it,'' he said. Cardinal O'Connor's successor, Edward M. Egan, bishop of Bridgeport, Conn., is to be installed as archbishop and head of the archdiocese on June 19.</p>
        <p>Plans for the building were spearheaded by Cardinal O'Connor and the late Msgr. Jeremiah Monahan, chancellor of the archdiocese. ''They were both involved in every aspect,'' Father McSweeney said, ''from the design of the building to the hiring of staff.''</p>
        <p>Father McSweeney, noting that Pope John Paul II has been urging bishops to preserve the church's history, art and documents, said that this will be the first official archive for the Archdiocese of New York, whose documents and artifacts have been stored in many locations and were often not easily accessible.</p>
        <p>''This center provides the opportunity for scholars to come into a comfortable environment and study the history of New York's parishes,'' said Laura M. Chmielewski, the center's director. ''It's really a historical center in that the materials will reflect the history of Catholic families and their role in the history of New York.''</p>
        <p>Much of the archival material involves correspondence between the archbishops and historical figures, including popes and presidents, Ms. Chmielewski said. ''We also have a historical file on each parish, which shows their growth over the years,'' she added, as well as artifacts, such as paintings, sacred vessels and various objects used at ground-breaking and other official ceremonies.</p>
        <p>Other large archdioceses already have archive centers, Father McSweeney said, ''but I believe few are freestanding structures like ours, and even fewer have been built from the ground up.''</p>
        <p>Once the center is completed, Ms. Chmielewski said, parishes will be encouraged to ship their historical documents to the center for cataloguing and storage. ''But we're not going to twist their arms,'' she said. ''It will be up to them.''</p>
        <p>The center is named for John Hughes, who in 1850 was named New York's first archbishop. Bracketing the center's entrance will be two maps tracing the history of the archdiocese, which was founded as a diocese in 1808 and became an archdiocese in 1850.</p>
        <p>One map will show the area it covered in 1808 -- ''all of New York State and northern New Jersey,'' Father McSweeney said. ''And in that entire area there were only two Catholic churches.''</p>
        <p>The other map will show the archdiocese today, which comprises Staten Island, the Bronx, Manhattan and seven counties north of New York City -- Westchester, Rockland, Orange, Dutchess, Putnam, Ulster and Sullivan. ''That's an area with over 3 million residents and a total of 413 parishes,'' Father McSweeney said.</p>
        <p>THE finishing touches are being applied to the $4 million center, which is expected to be available for scholarly research in the summer before its official fall opening, Ms. Chmielewski said.</p>
        <p>Its facade and red slate roof were designed to complement St. Joseph's main  building, a 100-year-old Italian Renaissance-style structure that dominates the 47-acre campus.</p>
        <p>At either end of the one-story center are two-story storage areas, each with one story underground. Papers will be stored in acid-free containers and kept in proper temperature environments, Ms. Chmielewski said.</p>
        <p>''Most of the building, 9,000 square feet, is committed to storage,'' said Louis Morandi, the project architect. ''Right now we'll only be using about 25 percent of the storage space available, but we can increase capacity any time as the collection continues to grow.'' The center will utilize a rolling compact filing system, which can grow when necessary, Mr. Morandi said.</p>
        <p>The building's entryway is a 35-foot octagonal design, mirrored in the main exhibit room. ''The octagonal design is repeated throughout the building,'' Mr. Morandi said. ''People may not be consciously aware of it, but it is meant to be restful.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Morandi said there would be a cupola above the front hallway, ''which we did as an interpretation of a cupola in the main seminary building.'' The hallway leads to the main exhibit space, in the center of the building.</p>
        <p>Also in the building are a scholars' reading room, with cubicles for six researchers; a processing room where materials will be examined and catalogued; and several offices, including the one that had been set aside for the cardinal.</p>
        <p>''The desk we ordered for the cardinal is a Vienna cherrywood, with gothic overtones,'' Mr. Morandi said. It sits under a coffered ceiling with a large round hanging light fixture. The office has its own Italian-tiled bathroom, in contrast to the center's other more utilitarian facilities.</p>
        <p>Mr. Morandi said that the office could eventually be used as a room for V.I.P.'s or as an entertainment center, since it will be outfitted with audio-visual equipment.</p>
        <p>AT first, Mr. Morandi said, he envisioned the center as an unadorned box-type structure, ''just something simple to sit in the middle of this beautiful campus environment.'' But the seminary building is so ''imposing, we felt we had to design something that would complement it,'' he said. ''We didn't try to replicate the seminary at all, just echo it with touches.''</p>
        <p>The center's first exhibit is to be devoted to Archbishop Hughes, a native of Ireland who was born in 1797 and came to the United States in 1817. ''It will also trace the history of Irish immigration at that time,'' Ms. Chmielewski said.</p>
        <p>Father McSweeney said he hoped the center would be used by many people. ''What the Ellis Island museum has done for immigrants we hope the center will also do,'' he said. ''The church was involved with these same people. So the center will have lots of valuable information on all New York's ethnic groups and the way that the church touched their lives.''</p>
