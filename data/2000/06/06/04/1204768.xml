        <p>Border war between Ethiopia and Eritrea is noteworthy because African states have generally observed Organization of African Unity's prohibition on warring against each other and also because both sides have generally observed recognized rules of war in old-fashioned sort of stand-up fight; civilian casualties from combat have been limited and neither side has accused the other of gross violations of human rights; such restrained conduct is of small comfort to the millions of civilians who face starvation as side effect of the war; photo (M)</p>

        <p>THE war between Ethiopia and Eritrea is often described as the most deadly in the world, fought on terrain of little consequence while millions of people in two very poor countries face starvation. This is all true.</p>
        <p>But the war -- which may finally be winding down after two years --  is also something else, something that has become quite rare: a war fought between the regular armies of two nations, in which both sides generally follow the rules of war.</p>
        <p>It is an irony that while civilian deaths from the side effects of war are so high, direct civilian casualties from combat are quite low. And neither side is accused of gross violations of human rights.</p>
        <p>It is, in short, a very old-fashioned kind of war, the only clearly defined conflict in the world right now between two nations (though India and Pakistan exchange artillery fire and the armies of Rwanda and Uganda have skirmished recently in a third country, Congo).</p>
        <p>Even the fighting itself has a tinge of sepia to it: armies lined up in trenches battle in close quarters, in contrast to the remote-control technological wars that rich nations favor these days.</p>
        <p>This is not to suggest in any way that this is a quaint or ''good'' war. But as Chris Bowers, a spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross, put it, ''It certainly has a different character, and that is important to note.''</p>
        <p>In Africa since the cold war ended, there has been a great deal of conflict but hardly any between nations. This pattern dates from the 1960's, when Africans gained their independence from Europe and the newly formed Organization of African Unity forbade nations from fighting each other directly. With few exceptions, they haven't, out of concern for self-preservation.</p>
        <p>Rather, the wars in Africa have tended to be internal explosions of ethnic violence, as in Rwanda or Burundi, or of flat-out greed masquerading as a liberation struggle, as in Angola or Sierra Leone.</p>
        <p>Civilians are often the targets in these wars: ethnic rivals are slaughtered in Rwanda; children's limbs are hacked off in Sierra Leone. Almost any hospital at any time in eastern Congo will have patients -- sliced in the head with machetes, pocked with bullet holes -- who have been caught in the fighting from one of the uncountable factions there.</p>
        <p>ETHIOPIA and Eritrea went to war in May 1998. Unlike many conflicts in Africa, which are the result of states falling apart, this was in many ways about people defining themselves as nations. Once an Italian colony, Eritrea was annexed in 1962 by Emperor Haile Selassie to become Ethiopia's northernmost province. In 1991, guerrillas from both Eritrea and Ethiopia defeated the emperor's successor, Mengistu Haile Mariam, and two years later Eritrea peacefully became a new nation.</p>
        <p>But its borders were not defined and good relations with Ethiopia never developed. So a series of border skirmishes exploded into all-out war that the leaders of neither side had the strength to stop.</p>
        <p>Because Ethiopia and Eritrea were until recently united, it could be argued that this war is just barely one between states. But they have fought as if it was. There were two trained armies lined up across trenches, with tanks, planes and artillery.</p>
        <p>A military analyst in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, believes this is why Eritrea has done so badly against an Ethiopian offensive launched on May 12: The Eritreans, he said, were excellent guerrilla fighters during their 30-year struggle against the emperor and then the Mengistu regime. But once they had to fight a conventional war, the analyst said: ''They didn't have a clue. Maybe the fact that they are a sovereign nation and think of themselves as a sovereign nation induced them to fight a battle they didn't know how to fight.'' (The Eritreans say they were not defeated militarily at all, but simply withdrew to save lives and fight on their own terms.)</p>
        <p>Early in the war, Ethiopia bombed what it said were military sites in the Eritrean capital, Asmara, and Eritrea bombed a school in the northern Ethiopian town of Mekele. Amnesty International has said ''dozens'' of civilians were killed in the first round of fighting. But since then, civilians have for the most part been moved away from the fronts, minimizing the danger.</p>
        <p>Even in the last two weeks -- as Ethiopia drove north away from the trenches and into Eritrean territory -- there have been few reports of civilians killed, no more than a handful on either side.</p>
        <p>IN the end, though, all of that may make little difference in the impact the war is having on these desperately poor societies.</p>
        <p>''The humanitarian disaster has been drought and famine affecting both countries,'' said Martin Hill, the Amnesty International researcher in London who follows the wars on the Horn of Africa. ''Fortunately there hasn't been another humanitarian disaster of killings of civilians or killing fleeing refugees.''</p>
        <p>As Mr. Hill suggests, this war may have been played more by the rules than others in Africa, but there is no taming war itself. Ultimately, it has been extraordinarily costly.</p>
        <p>Even before this latest round of fighting, it was estimated that this  very conventional war had ended the lives of at least 20,000 soldiers. Last year, President Clinton put the number of dead at 70,000.</p>
        <p>And that is far from the only cost. There is also the question of resources: The war diverted perhaps a billion dollars that could have gone toward development. Both nations are among the poorest in the world and have fought at a time when 8 million Ethiopians and some 770,000 Eritreans faced severe food shortages begun by drought and worsened by war.</p>
        <p>It is also estimated that some 550,000 Eritreans have been pushed from their homes by the latest round of fighting -- most of them in the most fertile agricultural areas.</p>
        <p>The two nations now have representatives in Algeria to talk about peace, but there has been no cease-fire and nobody is going home.</p>
        <p>''There has been a very severe effect on civilians,'' Mr. Bowers said. ''The food situation was not great beforehand. And this is not going to make it any better.''</p>
