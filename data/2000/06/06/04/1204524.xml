        <p>AFTER a performance in Chicago a few years ago, a woman came up to Roy Haynes and told him that the way he played drums reminded her of the four seasons. Not Vivaldi, but winter-spring-summer-fall.</p>
        <p>He liked that remark. Mr. Haynes embodies a great deal of jazz's history. He is among a small group of musicians who have seen 50 years' change of weather in jazz from the best vantage point -- the back of the bandstand, the rhythm section. He has played with practically everybody of major significance since the 1940's -- from Louis Armstrong to Pat Metheny, as he likes to say.</p>

        <p>AFTER a performance in Chicago a few years ago, a woman came up to Roy Haynes and told him that the way he played drums reminded her of the four seasons. Not Vivaldi, but winter-spring-summer-fall.</p>
        <p>He liked that remark. Mr. Haynes embodies a great deal of jazz's history. He is among a small group of musicians who have seen 50 years' change of weather in jazz from the best vantage point -- the back of the bandstand, the rhythm section. He has played with practically everybody of major significance since the 1940's -- from Louis Armstrong to Pat Metheny, as he likes to say.</p>
        <p>He is 75, small, bald and careful about his clothes, and he looks as fit as a soldier. The way he plays the drums sounds unprogrammed and original. When he's onstage, especially, he seldom repeats a pattern on the high-hat or the ride-cymbal. And where many drummers use those two cymbals as comfortable pulse-setters to lay underneath the main event of the drums themselves, he emphasizes them, smacking the cymbals loudly and making the audience hear the harmony and density in the metal. He displaces a band's rhythms, making the music sound as if it's spilling out over the sides of the stage.</p>
        <p>''If I'm listening to something on the radio and it becomes the same thing over and over,'' Mr. Haynes said last week, while sitting in the living room of his house near Long Island's south shore, ''I change the channel. If it's moving, I find out where it's going. It has to go someplace. If it just stays in one place, it becomes stagnant -- water, music, whatever.''</p>
        <p>When Mr. Haynes lived in Harlem in the late 40's and early 50's, the jazz musicians of his acquaintance were listening to Afro-Cuban music all the time -- the Cuban conguero Chano Pozo had joined Dizzy Gillespie's big band, and the orchestras led by Machito, Tito Puente and Tito Rodriguez were playing regular gigs at uptown dance halls. Whether there is a cause-and-effect relationship or not (Mr. Haynes disdains most suppositions about such things, feeling that his style has always been within him), he developed an outgoing, open sound on the drums that has led many compare him to a timbale or conga player. He lets rhythm flow through him without a feeling of constraint; sometimes the pulse gets stretched, but it's constantly changing, the kind of musicianship that always sounds modern.</p>
        <p>''It's the way he breaks up time,'' said David Kikoski, who has been Mr. Haynes's regular pianist since 1986. ''The accents he does with his different limbs are more complex than anything that came before him. The syncopation that he developed influenced all modern drummers. It sounds natural because it is natural. What he plays on the drums is the way he lives, the way he talks, the way he walks.''</p>
        <p>''The Roy Haynes Trio,'' a new disc on Verve/Universal recorded with the pianist Danilo Perez and the bassist John Patitucci, is an unpretentious little record that in some ways is a retrospective for Mr. Haynes. Cut in half between two sets, like an LP, it's half-studio and half-live; its repertory stretches from his early days (Bud Powell's ''Wail,'' which he recorded with Powell in 1949 on one of the most fundamental recording sessions in jazz) through the 1960's (a song by Chick Corea, on whose first album, ''Now He Sobs, Now He Sings,'' Mr. Haynes appeared, and with whom he still occasionally plays) and into the recent years (Pat Metheny's ''Question and Answer,'' taken from Mr. Metheny's 1989 trio album of the same name, with Mr. Haynes and Dave Holland). It's got a few formula bebop rhythms, a minimalist piece written by Thelonious Monk and beloved by drummers called ''Green Chimneys,'' as well as that open, unyielding conga sound, which happens quite naturally in a few places; Mr. Perez, from Panama, tends to draw Latin rhythms out of drummers by turning jazz vamps into Latin montunos, and Mr. Haynes responds energetically.</p>
        <p>The trio, starting an American tour, will perform at Birdland in New York this Thursday through Saturday. ''I never thought I would be this age and touring,'' Mr. Haynes said. He says he never wanted to become the kind of jazz musician who's still on stage after the point when he should have been told to hang it up. But forget age -- there are few better drummers in jazz.</p>
        <p>Asked when he first heard bebop, Mr. Haynes flinched a little. ''I feel like I've been playing it all my life,'' he said. ''I'm one of the inventors of it! Well, not really, but that's my period.'' All paradigm-shifting art styles have debatable beginnings: there are precursor figures who point the way and then a next wave young enough to swallow it whole and make an actual style of it. Mr. Haynes was from the latter camp.</p>
        <p>In Boston during the early 40's, Mr. Haynes was part of the vibrant black jazz subculture in the Roxbury section: he played for lindy-hoppers and zoot-suiters. He was in touch with the bebop coming from New York, buying the first records by Coleman Hawkins that carried intimations of the new style, taking the bus down to New York's 52nd street on weekends before he was out of his teens. He remembers writing a letter to his brother in 1943 in which he tried to describe the new sound he was hearing as something like the famously tight, complex music of the John Kirby band but with different harmonies.</p>
        <p>He moved to New York in 1945 at the request of the bandleader Luis Russell and joined the cast of characters who hung around the crossroads of 126th Street and Eighth Avenue. Jazz had central locations back then; musicians would sit in the bar of the Hotel Braddock, cruising for work, or stand on the corner eating and talking, holding a sort of open-air office hours. His first gig was at the Savoy Ballroom, playing for dancers again. In 1947 he joined Lester Young's band; two years later, when Young split up his band to go on tour with the popular Jazz at the Philharmonic revue, Mr. Haynes started working on 52nd Street, the new locus of activity, with different young bandleaders. ''It was fashionable, then, to leave the big bands and play with the small groups,'' he said. Mr. Haynes turned down a job offer from Duke Ellington in 1951, preferring to keep playing with Charlie Parker. ''That's what we wanted to do -- just stay in New York and gig.''</p>
        <p>One of his most instructive periods was his time spent as a member of Thelonious Monk's band during Monk's long residency at New York's Five Spot in the late 50's. ''Monk played the oddest tempos,'' Mr. Haynes recalled, singing a few floaty, neither-fast-nor-slow bars of ''Let's Cool One.'' ''He used to say that drummers can usually just play a few tempos,'' he said. ''If you take them out of those tempos, they'll either bring the tempo up or bring it back. And he may have had a point there.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Haynes also recorded and worked at clubs with jazz's finest vocalists and learned how to negotiate his way around each one's rhythmic center. ''Playing with Ella Fitzgerald,'' he said, alluding to her exact sense of time, ''was like playing with the Basie band. Playing with Billie Holiday was like playing with Prez. And playing with Sarah Vaughan was like playing with Charlie Parker.''</p>
        <p>Sarah Vaughan -- her great self-titled album from 1954, including Clifford Brown as well as Mr. Haynes, has just been reissued by Verve -- was one of the most challenging jazz musicians of the century. ''During that period,'' Mr. Haynes said, ''she sang the slowest ballads I have ever heard. Mmm. Today, it's harder to play really slowly with most bass players, because they don't fill out that space that needs to be filled out if the drummer's going to play with brushes.''</p>
        <p>''You see,'' he added, warming up to the topic, ''you can play something slow, but it can still have intensity in it. There's a way that 'Trane did it too, when he played a ballad. It wasn't necessarily that slow, but you'd be up there'' -- he raises his head above his head to show the rhythm section's level of intensity. His favorite subject seems to be time and what can be achieved by the subtle altering of it; he had just seen Willie Nelson performing on television and was full of praise for how the singer races the tempo of his singing and guitar playing while keeping an inner sense of steady time. ''He played one of Django Reinhardt's tunes,'' Mr. Haynes said. ''I said, my god. I didn't know he was that slick.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Haynes started leading groups in the late 60's, and like a number of other drummers -- Elvin Jones, Max Roach, Jack DeJohnette, Arthur Taylor -- has been a cultivater of young talent. He offers his experience to his charges, but experience hasn't taught Mr. Haynes to slow down.</p>
        <p>''He's got more energy than 20- and 30-year-old musicians I've travelled with,'' said Mr. Kikoski. ''We can be on a train for hours and hours, get to the bandstand and Roy will always be completely energized and ready to play.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Haynes contends that when he's not playing he gets restless. ''I probably sleep better when I'm playing,'' he said. ''If you really mean it, that's your life, that's your love, that's your religion. I mean, some people just start studying this thing, and that's a little different. I do it the old-fashioned way.''</p>
