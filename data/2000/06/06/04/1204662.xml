      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The tobacco-selling licenses of five Westchester businesses were suspended for selling tobacco to people under 18 several times. The suspensions were a result of a crackdown on violators of the state's Adolescent Tobacco Use Prevention Act. Under the law, first-time offenders can be fined up to $1,000. Those who have violated the law three times in two years, or four times overall, are subject to a suspension and can only reapply for a license after a year. Licenses were suspended from the CVS store Brook's Drugs, Rye Brook; CVS Pharmacy, Ardsley; Grand Union, Dobbs Ferry; West Hempstead Service Center, Pelham Manor; and Manor Market, Hastings-on-Hudson.</p>
