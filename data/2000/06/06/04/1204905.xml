        <p>Batya Lewton letter responds to Leon Botstein's May 28 Op-Ed commentary on standardized tests; contends timed tests do not accurately measure students' competence (M)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Leon Botstein (Op-Ed, May 28) writes, ''We still confuse speed with competence.'' That statement pinpoints a key problem with all standardized testing. Timed tests do not truly determine a student's competence. I taught many students (1956-71) in the New York City school system whose test scores belied their true abilities.</p>
        <p>Diagnostic tests in math used to be given in New York City schools during the first week of school. In 1956, elementary school students were given a simple six-page diagnostic math test by their classroom teachers to determine which skills they had learned in their previous grade and which skills had to be retaught or reinforced. The teacher marked the tests and grouped the students according to their needs in math.</p>
