        <p>Martin Ebner, the Swiss billionaire, may have received most of the attention last week when, as the chairman and largest shareholder of Algroup of Switzerland, the world's second-largest aluminum producer, he engineered the company's $4.7 billion sale to Alcan Aluminium of Canada. But the major supporting character in the company's action, and its second-largest shareholder, is his old friend Christoph Blocher, who has come to prominence in a whole new arena.</p>
        <p>Last fall, Mr. Blocher's ultranationalistic Swiss People's Party became the nation's second largest. Mr. Blocher strongly opposes any Swiss moves to join the European Union. He has also raised alarms about Switzerland's status as a favored destination for immigrants, who represent a larger share of the population there than in any other country in Western Europe.</p>

        <p>Martin Ebner, the Swiss billionaire, may have received most of the attention last week when, as the chairman and largest shareholder of Algroup of Switzerland, the world's second-largest aluminum producer, he engineered the company's $4.7 billion sale to Alcan Aluminium of Canada. But the major supporting character in the company's action, and its second-largest shareholder, is his old friend Christoph Blocher, who has come to prominence in a whole new arena.</p>
        <p>Last fall, Mr. Blocher's ultranationalistic Swiss People's Party became the nation's second largest. Mr. Blocher strongly opposes any Swiss moves to join the European Union. He has also raised alarms about Switzerland's status as a favored destination for immigrants, who represent a larger share of the population there than in any other country in Western Europe.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blocher's EMS Chemie is Europe's fourth-largest chemical company. He and Mr. Ebner are so close that Mr. Ebner's wife and business partner, Rosemarie, is said to be the godmother of one of Mr. Blocher's children. Mr. Ebner shares some of Mr. Blocher's political views, but Mr. Blocher now has a chance to put those views into practice.</p>
