        <p>The Pataki administration ordered the chairmen of the state's two Hudson River Greenway organizations late last month to fire their executive directors and several board members, an action that has angered environmentalists and prompted a backlash by state legislators.</p>
        <p>Members of the two groups' boards said the administration's effort to oust the two directors had introduced politics into a program whose success had depended on its bipartisanship.</p>
        <p>''It's like the Saturday Night Massacre,'' said Harriet Cornell, a Democratic member of the Rockland County Legislature who is one of the board members being singled out for dismissal. ''Here is a successful program that has managed to keep politics out, that has managed to work with conservationists, hunters, all kinds of people.''</p>
        <p>Assemblyman Richard Brodsky and Assemblywoman Susan John, both Democrats, announced on Thursday that they intended to hold hearings on the matter to determine who ordered the firings and why, and whether further measures were necessary to ensure the greenway's freedom from political interference.</p>
        <p>The two groups, known jointly as the Hudson River Valley Greenway, were created in 1991 to coordinate environmental planning, foster tourism and assist communities through grants in 13 counties bordering the Hudson, from Waterford in Saratoga County to Battery Park in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Representative Maurice Hinchey of Saugerties, who wrote the greenway legislation as an assemblyman, said it was deliberately written to avoid partisan politics. ''It's going to be very detrimental to the Hudson Valley over the next several years if this goes through as it's been laid out,'' he said. ''To very precipitously and unceremoniously remove these people without presenting any rationale undermines confidence in the program and jeopardizes its fulfillment.''</p>
        <p>The two directors had consistently received positive reviews from their boards and have not been given a reason for their dismissal. Both have served in their positions since the greenway's inception. David Sampson, director of the Hudson River Valley Greenway Communities Council, is a Democrat, and Maggie Vinciguerra, director of the Greenway Conservancy for the Hudson River Valley, is a Republican.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sampson cited what he considered one possible reason for their removal. He and Ms. Vinciguerra attended a presentation on Hudson Valley programs earlier this year by Andrew Cuomo, the secretary of housing and urban development and a potential political rival to Gov. George E. Pataki.</p>
        <p>The directorships each pay $100,000 a year.</p>
        <p>Late last month, the chairmen of the two groups were directed by Pataki administration officials to either fire their executive directors or to have their boards do so at their next joint meeting, on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>A Pataki spokesman, Michael McKeon, said, ''We believe new leadership will bring new energy and vitality to the greenway and make it even better than it is today.'' He added that Governor Pataki was a co-sponsor of the greenway's founding legislation in 1991 and had consistently supported its mission.</p>
        <p>Mr. McKeon said the administration had told the boards of the two groups of its intentions some time ago.</p>
        <p>But Matthew Bender IV, chairman of the Greenway Conservancy, said he was astonished by the instructions when he was called in to speak to the governor's appointments officials on May 24. He said he told them that he saw no reason to fire his executive director, Ms. Vinciguerra, and that he would have to speak to the conservancy board about the matter.</p>
        <p>On Friday, Mr. Bender was himself dismissed by Pataki administration officials, a move that provoked further anger from legislators and environmentalists.</p>
        <p>He will be replaced by Kevin Plunkett, a lawyer and a member of the Westchester County chapter of the League of Conservation Voters, Mr. McKeon said. Mr. Plunkett is the brother of William Plunkett, a partner at Governor Pataki's former law firm, Plunkett &amp; Jaffe of White Plains.</p>
        <p>''This is a coup d'etat,'' said Andrew Mele, executive director of Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, an environmental watchdog group. ''Greenway is being transformed from a legitimate regional organization to just a political tool.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Governor Pataki's proposed successor to Mr. Sampson, Barbara Murphy, has been criticized as inappropriate because of her links to a development project. Ms. Murphy is one of three principal investors in Riverbanks, a multimillion-dollar condominium project in Cold Spring, N.Y., that has drawn opposition from residents. The Greenway Communities Council has played a role in negotiating the dispute. If Ms. Murphy becomes the council's director, she will be in charge of the group that is negotiating the dispute over her own project.</p>
        <p>''It's a flagrant conflict of interest,'' Mr. Mele said.</p>
        <p>No successor to Ms. Vinciguerra has been named.</p>
        <p>The governor's plan to replace the directors appears likely to succeed,  with a majority of votes on the boards of both greenway groups nearly certain, said Barnabas McHenry, chairman of the Greenway Communities Council.</p>
        <p>The council and the conservancy have a combined operating budget of about $1.1 million a year. They jointly manage the programs of the Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area, designated by Congress in 1996.</p>
