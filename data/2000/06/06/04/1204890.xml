        <p>Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio was one of the first candidates to drop out of this year's race for the Republican presidential nomination. And though he is chairman of the House Budget Committee, a major power post, he is not seeking re-election to a 10th term in Ohio's 12th Congressional District, which stretches north from Columbus.</p>
        <p>So is Mr. Kasich abandoning politics for good, having spent almost half his 48 years in elective office?</p>
        <p>No way, he insists.</p>
        <p>While he has started looking for a nonpolitical job to settle into once he leaves Congress, perhaps something in the business world, he says he will stay involved in politics and may even run for office again, possibly  president. To that end, he disclosed last week, he has formed a political action committee, the New Century Project, with the goal of raising $500,000 over the next year for distribution to candidates around the country who strike his political fancy -- limited-government conservatives like him.</p>
        <p>''It's my way of continuing to be in public service without holding public office,'' Mr. Kasich told The Columbus Dispatch. ''And to do that, frankly, you have to have some resources, some staff, an organization. It will allow me to build a network of people around the country who I will have a relationship with and who are potential supporters for me in the future.''</p>
        <p>A footnote: His presidential campaign committee, Kasich 2000, is still in operation and will finance his political travels this year. It has almost $1 million in the till, according to the latest Federal Election Commission report.</p>
