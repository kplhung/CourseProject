        <p>HOPING to capitalize on the expansion of technology companies, a small group of developers in the Hackensack Meadowlands are constructing buildings or converting warehouses for new-economy tenants.</p>
        <p>For decades low-slung warehouses, mostly manufacturers' distribution centers, have dominated the Meadlowlands, a 32-square-mile region that stretches through 14 communities in Bergen and Hudson Counties. But with dot-com companies and Internet service providers pushing into  areas like the garment district in Manhattan and the Hudson River waterfront in Jersey City, the Meadowlands offers an alternative, commercial brokers said. The draws are its proximity to transportation, access to fiber optics and lower rents.</p>
        <p>''The shift is real,'' said Richard Fritzsky, the president of the Meadowlands Chamber of Commerce.</p>
        <p>Frank Lopriore, a managing director in the Saddle Brook office of Insignia/ESG, the national commercial brokerage company, said, ''The issue is that there is a demand but no inventory.''</p>
        <p>Some developers, like Penhorn Construction of Secaucus, are responding by putting up high-tech flex buildings, as they are called, because they can be used for offices or for distribution or assembly operations. The company recently completed and leased two buildings totaling 100,000 square feet on Penhorn Avenue in Secaucus, drawing e-commerce companies as tenants. Now it is advancing plans for two more buildings.</p>
        <p>And on Meadowlands Parkway at Castle Road in Secaucus, M. Rappaport Real Estate of Englewood Cliffs recently completed leasing a 145,000-square-foot building. It had rebuilt 55,000 square feet of office space there and turned the remaining 90,000 square feet of retail space into office space for high-tech tenants. The company is selling 10 acres nearby, also on Meadowlands Parkway, to Hudson Development L.L.C. of Brooklyn, which is planning a high-tech building as big as 225,000 square feet to appeal to similar tenants.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Whitehall Industrial Properties of Edison bought a 170,000-square-foot industrial building in Carlstadt last month and plans to reconfigure it into smaller spaces for technology companies. Young Woo &amp; Associates of Manhattan is buying a 200,000-square-foot warehouse, also in Carlstadt, and plans to turn it into a telecommunications center, a so-called ''telco hotel,'' with a number of technology and telecommunications tenants under one roof.</p>
        <p>Such businesses, including companies that provide Internet data centers, which manage Internet sites for businesses, are scouring the Meadowlands for space. Last month, Gift Certificate.com of Manhattan  leased a 100,000-square-foot warehouse in Carlstadt and plans to transform it into an order-fulfillment center. In February, Webvan Inc., an Internet grocer, leased a 348,885-square-foot warehouse in North Bergen from Hartz Mountain Industries of Secaucus, among the largest property owners in the Meadowlands. It plans to use the warehouse as a distribution center.</p>
        <p>Tenants requiring over 500,000 square feet of space are still in the market, said Jonathan S. Meisel, an associate director at the East Rutherford office of Cushman &amp; Wakefield, the national brokerage company. ''We see the Meadowlands as the next hotbed of activity for Web-centric businesses,'' he said.</p>
        <p>From 1994 to 1999 the number of high-tech jobs, including telecommunications and computer software development and related services, grew in New Jersey by 59,000 to 295,0000 jobs, according to state figures. A report released last month by Nasdaq and the American Electronics Association ranked New Jersey seventh in the nation in the number of such jobs.</p>
        <p>While the presence of high-tech operations in the Meadowlands is growing, such companies are not completely new to the area. Mr. Fritzsky of the Chamber of Commerce said that over a decade ago Ernst &amp; Young and Salomon Smith Barney set up data centers in the Meadowlands.</p>
        <p>COMDISCO, an international technology management company based in Rosemont, Ill., is consolidating four operations in the region into a 302,000-square-foot building under way on Central Boulevard in Carlstadt. Next door, Chase Manhattan Bank is developing a 176,000 square-foot check-processing operation</p>
        <p>Brokers say the presence of such tenants is one of the reasons the Meadowlands will appeal to high-tech companies. In addition, it is close to Newark and Teterboro airports and to Manhattan, where many clients have offices, Mr. Lopriore of Insignia/ESG said. And, he added, the tight commercial market in Manhattan is pushing companies to seek space elsewhere, and one of those places is the Meadowlands.</p>
        <p>The Meadowlands will also be more accessible once transportation improvements are made. Construction is under way on the $448 million Secaucus Transfer rail station, which will link several rail lines to provide direct train service to Manhattan from Bergen and Passaic Counties. The project, which will allow employees to commute more easily from New York City, is to be completed by 2002.</p>
        <p>The vacancy rate in the 72-million-square-foot Meadowlands industrial market is 3.25 percent, Mr. Lopriore said. That translates to 2.3 million square feet, much of it in obsolete industrial buildings, he said, adding that such buildings can be converted to suit the needs of technology companies. The average annual asking rents in the region are $6.50 a square foot, he said, compared with asking rents in Manhattan of $30 to $40 a square foot.</p>
        <p>That price difference makes the Meadowlands ''a competitive alternative,'' said Mr. Meisel of Cushman &amp; Wakefield. The area also has access multiple sources of electric power and a fiber-optic network, he added.</p>
        <p>Those factors encouraged Gift Certificate.com to lease the Carlstadt building at 190 Jony Drive, said Alan J. Desino, a senior managing director in the Manhattan office of Insignia/ESG, who represented the company. It had looked at space in Manhattan, he said, but in terms of price and access to labor, the Meadowlands was more favorable. He said the company would occupy 77,000 square feet initially and would reconfigure it as an order-fulfillment center.</p>
        <p>To meet this sort of demand by high-tech tenants, Hari Bhasin, the president of Penhorn Construction, was prompted to to develop two high-tech buildings in Secaucus. The $8 million buildings at 501 and 601 Penhorn Avenue contain 100,000 square feet, 70,000 square feet at 501 and 30,000 at 601. Each building is divided into blocks of 5,000 to 20,000 square feet to draw start-up as well as expanding companies needing office and distribution space. The project was completely leased even before it was finished in March, he said. Annual rents average $8 a square foot triple net, meaning that tenants pay taxes, common-area charges and utilities.</p>
        <p>One tenant is Vitamin Shop.com, part of Vitamin Shop Industries of North Bergen, which took 20,000 square feet at 501 Penhorn. ''As our Internet business grows, we need to expand our distribution capability,'' said Steven Linn, the director of operations. The building has the telecommunications capacity, including high-speed Internet connections, that the company will eventually  tap for its online business, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bhasin said he was seeking approvals to develop two additional buildings on 12 adjacent acres, which he would lease at slightly higher rents. Construction of those buildings, totaling 175,000 square feet, is to start this fall. They are expected to be completed in 12 months at a cost of $14 million, he said.</p>
        <p>Smaller companies are the tenants that  Hudson Development expects to draw to Castle Industrial Park, the high-tech building with a maximum of 225,000 square feet the company plans to build on the 10 acres it is buying in Secaucus. ''The activity in Manhattan feeds Secaucus, and we are seeing an overflow,'' said Daniel P. Gleich, a principal in Hudson Development. His company plans to divide the $12.5 million building into  blocks of 7,500 square feet.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gleich said he expected to start construction this summer; the building is to be completed next year. In Carlstadt, Whitehall Industrial Properties L.L.C. plans to carve the 170,000-square-foot warehouse it bought at 401 Washington Avenue into 50,000- to 60,000-square-foot spaces. ''Traditional companies are changing to e-commerce and doing more business over the Internet, but they still need production and distribution space to get their products out,'' said Michael Nachamkin, the president of Whitehall, an affiliate of Goldman, Sachs.</p>
        <p>The Whitehall Street Real Estate Fund committed $75 million to the company, which was formed last November to acquire, develop and redevelop industrial properties in the Northeast. The Carlstadt project, valued at over $5 million, is the company's first in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nachamkin said he expected to start work in June on the exterior of the building, which the seller still occupies. Annual rents are expected to be $7 to $10 a square foot, triple net.</p>
