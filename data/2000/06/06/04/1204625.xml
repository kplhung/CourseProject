        <p>FOR generations vacationers in resort towns throughout the Northeast would spend lovely summer evenings enjoying plays put on by summer stock theaters. The stock companies would stay all summer, churning out a play a week, and big stars would often perform. In 1941, among those making the summer circuit were Tyrone Power, Tallulah Bankhead and Sally Rand. But the advent of television, changes in vacation destinations and sky-rocketing production costs proved too much for those little theaters.</p>
        <p>Today, there are only 12 old-fashioned summer stock theaters in the country operating under Actor's Equity contracts. The professional summer theaters that have folded in the state in recent decades include the Cape May Playhouse, the Playhouse on the Mall in Paramus, the Grist Mill in Andover, the Camden County Music Fair, the Music Circus in Lambertville, the Smithville Music Fair, and, last year, Summerfun in Montclair. Many professional theaters, like Paper Mill Playhouse, the New Jersey Shakespeare Festival and Theaterfest, produce shows during the summer.

        <p>FOR generations vacationers in resort towns throughout the Northeast would spend lovely summer evenings enjoying plays put on by summer stock theaters. The stock companies would stay all summer, churning out a play a week, and big stars would often perform. In 1941, among those making the summer circuit were Tyrone Power, Tallulah Bankhead and Sally Rand. But the advent of television, changes in vacation destinations and sky-rocketing production costs proved too much for those little theaters.</p>
        <p>Today, there are only 12 old-fashioned summer stock theaters in the country operating under Actor's Equity contracts. The professional summer theaters that have folded in the state in recent decades include the Cape May Playhouse, the Playhouse on the Mall in Paramus, the Grist Mill in Andover, the Camden County Music Fair, the Music Circus in Lambertville, the Smithville Music Fair, and, last year, Summerfun in Montclair. Many professional theaters, like Paper Mill Playhouse, the New Jersey Shakespeare Festival and Theaterfest, produce shows during the summer. But only one old-fashioned professional summer stock theater remains in New Jersey: the Surflight Theater.</p>
        <p>One block from the sea in Beach Haven on Long Beach Island, the Surflight has been entertaining audiences since 1950. It was founded by Joseph P. Hayes, a man of legendary optimism. He died in 1976 at the age of 50. A Buddy Holly look-alike, his smiling face beams down from a photograph backstage near James Dean's picture. Mr. Hayes's love of summer theater is a legacy that lives on in the Surflight's loyal audiences and in its current management. In an age when summer stock has almost faded into American history, attendance at the Surflight has been climbing and last year it became an Equity theater.</p>
        <p>''I applaud the efforts made to revive summer stock in its original patterns which is being attempted at the Surflight,'' said Lynn Archer, a member of the governing board of the Actors' Equity Association and chairwoman of the union's stock committee. ''Summer vacation should always include theater instead of sitting in the hotel room watching TV.''</p>
        <p>When longtime Surflight patrons go to the theater on Engleside and Beach Avenues, they remember their youth. When Steve Steiner, the artistic director, first went there in 1997, he saw great potential, and when the producer T. Scott Henderson, a former banker, looks things over, his eyes fix on the bottom line. Then there are the young people who join the company each summer. They see the theater as a way to make their dreams come true.</p>
        <p>Only 40 or so actors are chosen from the 1,200 who audition. Aspiring set designers, choreographers, costume designers, seamstresses, stagehands and musicians also want to come to the Surflight. They all arrived two weeks ago. ''Welcome to the next four months of your life, to lots of shows, lots of sets to build,'' Mr. Steiner told them. An actor who was in ''Annie Warbucks,'' ''Anything Goes'' and ''The Buddy Holly Story'' on Broadway, Mr. Steiner and his wife, Gail, who became the Surflight's company and production manager, moved from New York to Beach Haven two years ago to take on the challenges of doing a new play every two weeks.</p>
        <p>This summer, the Surflight will be doing ''Brigadoon,'' ''Meet Me in St. Louis,'' ''Titanic,'' ''Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat,'' ''The Sound of Music,'' ''West Side Story,'' ''Victor/Victoria'' and ''Babes in Arms'' -- and doing children's theater as well. The work is grueling.</p>
        <p>''I'm committed!'' said petite, bright-eyed Elena Gutierrez, from Egg Harbor, who studies at the Boston Conservatory of Music. She will play Maggie in Brigadoon, Kate Mullins in Titanic and Anita in West Side Story this summer. Her boyfriend, Dave Milnes, from Cinnaminson, studies at the Berklee College of Music in Boston. He will be the assistant musical director. Working with Ms. Gutierrez professionally will be no problem, he said. ''We keep it objective when she's on the stage,'' Mr. Milnes said.</p>
        <p>Sean Fenlon, 19, a theater major at Southern Regional State College in Stockton is hoping that he will be a Jet and not a Shark in West Side Story because he can't do Spanish accents or so he thinks. Tim Falter, a professional actor from Manhattan, is looking forward to working on his skills and watching the others grow as well. After all, he said, there is not that much difference between the professionals and the students. Mr. Steiner is hoping that the personalities in the company mesh -- and that his staff can figure out how to make the Titanic ''sink'' on stage without it looking ''too cheesy.''</p>
        <p>Last weekend the Surflighters gave their first performances to virtually sold-out houses. It was a gala with musical samples of the shows to come. The words to the original songs were changed. A song taken from Titanic described the voyage that the cast was about to embark on this summer:</p>
        <p>Farewell, farewell</p>
        <p>We're off to Surflight</p>
        <p>Theater by the sea.</p>
        <p>As it journeys on</p>
        <p>Fifty-one years strong.</p>
        <p>Summer Stock</p>
        <p>Articles in this series are looking at New Jersey's only summer stock theater. Other articles will revisit the theater at midsummer and at the end of the summer.</p>
