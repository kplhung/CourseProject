        <p>Q: Several pharmaceutical companies have recently decided to slash the price of antiretroviral drugs for developing countries, most notably Africa. But even with the price cut, a year's supply of drugs still would cost about $1,000 -- more money than most Africans earn in a year. So is there less to this than meets the eye?</p>
        <p>It is true that most Africans with H.I.V. won't have access to the drugs. But not everybody is living below the poverty line. People working in the private sector often have insurance. This is going to benefit tens of thousands of people.</p>

        <p>Q: Several pharmaceutical companies have recently decided to slash the price of antiretroviral drugs for developing countries, most notably Africa. But even with the price cut, a year's supply of drugs still would cost about $1,000 -- more money than most Africans earn in a year. So is there less to this than meets the eye?</p>
        <p>It is true that most Africans with H.I.V. won't have access to the drugs. But not everybody is living below the poverty line. People working in the private sector often have insurance. This is going to benefit tens of thousands of people.</p>
        <p>But for the vast majority of Africans, this is only symbolic gesture.</p>
        <p>Look, we aren't naive. Ninety to 95 percent of Africans who carry the virus don't even know they are infected. So we've got to work on a lot of very basic issues. This is just one step, but it's important because it's the first time the big pharmaceutical companies accept the principle of equity pricing, that the same product can be sold in a poor market for less than it's sold in a rich market.</p>
        <p>Do you think the West is now doing enough to combat the AIDS epidemic in Africa?</p>
        <p>I'm not someone who blames the West for everything. I do believe that the great moral test of our time is how the rich countries respond to the AIDS crisis. But AIDS has not been high on the agenda of the highly affected countries, so this is a bit of a failure for the countries of the north and for the countries of the south. At the moment, a total of $300 million is being spent on prevention and awareness for the whole continent. We need $2 billion to do this.</p>
        <p>If you had to choose, which would you say is more important in the fight against AIDS in Africa: lowering prices of drugs, or relieving the huge national debt of the affected countries?</p>
        <p>If the money is used right, debt relief is more important. I'm a blunt realist. These drugs aren't going to help the majority of people with AIDS. Debt relief would help if it would free up dollars to go to health. But if that money goes to buy more weapons, then it's a terrible waste.</p>
        <p>South Africa's president, Thabo Mbeki, recently reignited the controversy over whether H.I.V. actually causes AIDS. Was that infuriating for you?</p>
        <p>President Mbeki has never said that AIDS is not caused by H.I.V. He's asking questions. The people I'm angry with are the ones who are exploiting this, the dissidents who argue that H.I.V. doesn't cause AIDS. The ideas of these dissidents are criminal. Frankly, they're all in California, not South Africa. If people believe that AIDS is not transmitted sexually, more people will become infected and die. I hope this debate will be closed as soon as possible.</p>
        <p>Ten or 15 years ago, some public health officials said that malaria would be eradicated by the year 2000. But it's stronger than ever. If malaria can't be conquered in Africa, how will AIDS ever be conquered?</p>
        <p>I'm an optimist. In a few countries like Uganda and Senegal, we have seen profound changes in sexual behavior brought about by public education. In the Ugandan capital, the infection rate was about 30 percent in 1990 and 1991. Now it's about 12 percent. Surveys show that young people are starting sexual activities two years later on average than they were in 1991. I'm not as optimistic about malaria. There is no Act Up for malaria. H.I.V. people are very vocal. AIDS kills adults in their prime. Malaria's victims are generally dead by the time they're 2.</p>
        <p>That's a cold statement, don't you think?</p>
        <p>It's a cold calculus, yes. It's easier to mobilize people on the question of AIDS. Malaria is more depressing. But we can't address one and not the other. They both kill millions.</p>
        <p>And what about Ebola? You are the co-discoverer of the Ebola virus. Which one is worse, that virus or H.I.V.?</p>
        <p>H.I.V., by far. Ebola kills people two weeks after they've been infected. It's very dramatic. People die around you and you take immediate measures. AIDS is silent. People spread it without knowing they have it. It's transmitted by private behavior. AIDS is still very hard to discuss.</p>
        <p>You lead a strange life. You spend half your days in European hotels and corporate boardrooms and half your days among poor Africans who are going to die prematurely because of AIDS. How do you handle the basic unfairness of it all?</p>
        <p>I'm angry all the time. But it's important anger. Anger motivates me. I do this with my heart, not just my brain.</p>
