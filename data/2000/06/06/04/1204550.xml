        <p>THERESA McGee is a freelance pianist, organist and choral conductor. Last December she was in so much pain that she feared that she would not be able to meet her many holiday performance commitments. That's when she went to the Musicians Clinic at the University of Connecticut Health Center in Farmington.</p>
        <p>Ms. McGee's problems with back, neck, shoulder, elbow, wrist and finger pain had worsened over the previous three years. After an evaluation by one of the clinic's doctors, she began anti-inflammatory medication, physical therapy and a home exercise program.</p>
        <p>Upper body injuries are common among musicians, said Dr. Martin Cherniack, director of the clinic, the only one of its kind in the state. He cited studies that found that 35 to 60 percent of musicians had had career-damaging injuries, and that 20 to 40 percent of conservatory students had had injuries that forced them to stop playing for a period of time or to end their careers.</p>
        <p>The clinic specializes in a type of injury called repetitive strain injury, or cumulative trauma disorder.</p>
        <p>''Musicians use the very fine, small muscles in the body,'' said Vera Wills, who is on the faculty of the Manhattan School of Music. ''They practice hours a day, and perform a great deal. It's a big overuse syndrome. They work too hard at what they do without being physically conditioned for the task. It's not just the fingers that play the instrument. The whole body plays the instrument. The musician has to train like an athlete.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Wills goes to the clinic regularly to retrain patients in performance technique and posture and to make recommendations for ergonomic modification of patients' instruments. The latter can involve changing the position of a key, for example.</p>
        <p>In a recent session at the piano, Ms. Wills taught Ms. McGee how to use the large muscles of her back and upper arms to reduce the work of the small muscles of her wrists and fingers, and how to sway her body to get her torso out of the way as her arms moved across the keyboard.</p>
        <p>Ms. McGee, whose condition is improving, did keep her holiday commitments, but her injuries have forced her to limit her performance schedule since then.</p>
        <p>Ms. Wills works as part of a team with Heather Wilkens, the clinic's occupational therapist, who does the physical therapy and directs the patients' exercise programs. ''I can't move somebody into good position if their muscles are too weak or too damaged to stay there,'' Ms. Wills said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Wilkens is herself a musician with career-altering injuries. While practicing the flute six hours a day for graduate school auditions, she developed problems with her shoulder, wrist and fifth finger, as well as numbness and tingling in her hand.</p>
        <p>Two years and four doctors later, she had recovered 90 percent of her function, but still couldn't play as intensely as she felt she needed in order to pursue a professional career. To understand her own problems better and to learn how to help other musicians, she attended occupational therapy school at the University of Hartford, graduating in 1998.</p>
        <p>Ms. Wilkens evaluates her patients' techniques, practice habits, exercise habits, emotional outlooks, overall stress levels and other activities, like computer work, which can also cause repetitive strain injury. She gives them stretches and exercises to do before and after they play  as well as exercises to increase strength, flexibility and endurance. She also works with their posture and manipulates their muscles and soft tissue. Like Ms. Wilkens and Ms. McGee, many musicians develop multiple upper body problems. ''It's all one biomechanical chain,'' Ms. Wills said. ''The whole unit is affected from the neck on down.''</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, each instrument presents its own characteristic problems, Ms. Wilkens said. Drummers, for example, often have difficulties with their wrists, from a tendency to snap them rather than use the larger muscle groups. Guitarists tend to use too much tension when they press the strings, causing forearm pain and finger problems. Violinists have neck and shoulder injuries from grabbing the violin between their shoulders and chins.</p>
        <p>Cellists have elbow strain from changing their bow positions. Clarinetists have difficulties with their right thumbs from their thumb rests, and shoulder pain because of a tendency to shrug while playing.</p>
        <p>The Musicians Clinic uses only nonsurgical treatments. ''Surgery is frequently not an option for musicians,'' said Dr. Cherniack, a specialist in upper extremity medicine. After surgery, patients usually don't regain completely normal function, he said, and even a small loss can have a huge impact on the performance of a professional musician.</p>
        <p>About 150 patients currently attend the clinic. Many are conservatory students and professional musicians, especially members of the Hartford and New Haven symphony orchestras.</p>
        <p>Most musicians don't talk about their injuries, Ms. Wilkens said. ''People will be less likely to hire you if they know that you're injured,'' she explained. ''So it's a hush-hush kind of problem.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Wilkens, who wears a plastic splint on her fifth finger when she plays the flute, still hopes to work part-time someday as a professional musician. But Carolyn Strnad, a patient at the clinic for about a year, gave up such hopes many years ago. Ms. Strnad's music career ended in the late 1970's, while she was a graduate student in piano performance.</p>
        <p>''It hit me all at one point, where I got this sharp, intense pain in my left elbow,'' she said. ''It just shot straight up to my shoulder. My arm was dead. I couldn't do anything with it. I had to stop playing.''</p>
        <p>Many students in her program developed similar problems, she said, and she learned much later that the technique she was being taught was very likely to cause injuries. Eventually she became a computer programmer. She tried to get back into music by taking up the harpsicord, but developed a problem in her right elbow and had to give it up.</p>
        <p>Ms. Strnad is now able to play the piano about 15 minutes a day a couple of times a week. She said she hesitates to set goals because she doesn't want to set herself up for disappointment, but she would like to be able to play at a satisfying level for her own enjoyment.</p>
        <p>Then perhaps she could try for a higher level. ''It would be great to play some chamber music,'' she said, cautioning that she doesn't think that she could ever play professionally again.</p>
        <p>Most clinic patients have done extremely well, Dr. Cherniack said. ''One of the reasons is that this is a very disciplined group of people,'' he observed. ''We rarely find a musician who doesn't follow a very arduous exercise and rehabilitation program.''</p>
        <p>But Dr. Cherniack, Ms. Wills and Ms. Wilkens all agree that prevention is key.</p>
        <p>''It would be nice if more schools educated students in body mechanics and technique,'' Ms. Wilkens said. ''And it needs to start when they start playing, before the habits have been ingrained. You take someone who's been playing an instrument for 10 or 20 years, and to try to ask them to make changes is like trying to pull teeth. It's hard mentally, it's hard emotionally, it's hard physically.''</p>
