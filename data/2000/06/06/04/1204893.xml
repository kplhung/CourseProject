        <p>THERE was symbolism and symmetry to the end of another Knicks season Friday night, when their drive to make it cross-country, to the finals, featured Latrell Sprewell at the wheel, steering an offense that offered little communication and less companionship.</p>
        <p>Seven months ago, when Sprewell spurned the Knicks' South Carolina training camp to test America's speed limits and was ''punished'' with a corporate wink and a rich new contract, the Knicks spiritually became his team, on his terms. Sprewell was soon more popular than ever, more the Knicks' spokesman, more the name and number that drove their merchandising machine.</p>
        <p>Patrick Ewing as the franchise's vital force was clearly passe. Wherever these Knicks were going, the mercurial Sprewell would be taking them. He led them into the fourth quarter of Game 6 of the Eastern Conference finals -- carried them, really -- and then Reggie Miller jumped the Knicks by the side of the road again late in the New York night. Latrell Sprewell's Knicks thus suffered the kind of numbing playoff breakdown that has haunted Patrick Ewing's Knicks for years.</p>
        <p>''To be honest, I think the Miami series took a lot out of us,'' Sprewell said after the Pacers had eliminated the Knicks, 93-80, and when it finally was Miller's time to play for a ring. ''I know how tired I was and how banged up I was.''</p>
        <p>Who isn't at this time of spring?</p>
        <p>Miami has come up a point short against the Knicks two years running with Tim Hardaway barely able to move. A year ago, the Knicks took these same Pacers out when Miller had a bad ankle, when Travis Best pulled a groin and, let's be honest, Rik Smits has played hurt for years.</p>
        <p>Injuries do not make for great sports talk radio so, of course, there was bound to be more blaming of Ewing, a sad, solitary figure Friday night as he walked off the court to unwarranted derision, to ice his aching right foot and dwell on another round of unfulfilled dreams.</p>
        <p>The Knicks' 27th consecutive season without a championship was no more his fault than anyone else's, but it was a convenient excuse before and after the Knicks blew an 18-point lead in Game 5. Sprewell ran with the Ewing won-lost playoff numbers against the Pacers on the record because he generally speaks his mind, and if the coach and the organization do not appreciate it, well, that's a bridge they all crossed back in October.</p>
        <p>Jeff Van Gundy recognized what was happening, that several of his players, fearing their own failure, were ready to make Ewing their scapegoat. After the way Ewing stood up to Alonzo Mourning in Games 6 and 7 of the Miami series, made the winning shot of that series to get them to Indianapolis, it was almost pathetic.</p>
        <p>When the Pacers intensified their defensive rotations in Games 5 and 6, it was a reminder of how inconsistent the undersized and always hurting Larry Johnson has been here as a power player, and how underskilled Marcus Camby is on the offensive end. Too many Knicks anonymously mumbled about how Ewing clogged the paint while forgetting all the possessions he would jog out to the 3-point line and just stand there as a side was cleared out for someone else.</p>
        <p>The stubbornly proud Ewing deserved criticism in the past, but it got to be a bad habit and then an excuse. The truth is, he has only been a part-time piece to the puzzle for a couple of years.</p>
        <p>This was Sprewell's team that did not make it back to the finals, and he was not exactly Michael Jordan in the fourth quarter these past few weeks. During Ewing's prime, he often had games just like the one Sprewell had Friday night, and usually did not hear the end of it. That was fair. It came with the star territory, with the grand stage of expectations of midtown Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Sprewell valiantly kept the Knicks close in Game 6 and got them the lead, 65-62, with a 3-pointer with 11 minutes 40 seconds remaining. It was his last significant basket. Sprewell scored 32 points on 26 shots, 2 points fewer than Miller, but the lasting playoff images are made in the fourth quarter. Soon Miller hit the first of a trio of three-balls that cut the Knicks' heart out, the last of which he launched from 25 feet away over Sprewell's fingertips.</p>
        <p>And while the Pacers went from 3 points behind to 7 ahead, Sprewell rushed and missed three crucial jump shots, which he later wished he could ''take back.'' No one else had much going by then, so there is little point in second-guessing, unless the others were stone-cold from standing around and watching Sprewell do his thing, which is how it has always worked for Ewing.</p>
        <p>It has been said that Sprewell did not want the responsibility of the franchise-player role on a bad team in Golden State. Other than the training-camp thing and chronic lateness, he was a team player, a team leader, this season. Yet at the end, it was a disturbing sign that he preferred the Knicks' fate to be more a reflection on a 37-year-old center whose body is conceding, joint by joint, and who pretty much did all he could.</p>
        <p>Maybe the Knicks will now make a push for Grant Hill. Maybe they will dangle Allan Houston, who played poorly from start to finish Friday, and maybe he is inhibited more by Sprewell than by Ewing.</p>
        <p>''I wouldn't be surprised -- this is the N.B.A.,'' Sprewell said, when asked if he expects changes to be made.</p>
        <p>Whoever the star is here, he inherits those 27 years of championship-less basketball. When another season ends, Micheal Ray Richardson flashes by, out of control. Charles Smith again misses four shots under the basket. John Starks keeps misfiring in Houston. Bernard King reinjures his knee. The Ewing of yesteryear fails in the clutch.</p>
        <p>Blame? No. Fact? Yes. With Sprewell's pedal-to-the-metal approach sputtering in the fourth quarter Friday night, the Knicks are 0-1 in the playoffs with him as their undisputed marquee man.</p>
