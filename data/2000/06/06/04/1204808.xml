        <p>For investors on Wall Street, bad news was good news, at least when it came to the economy.</p>
        <p>Economic reports last week showed that more people were out of work in May and that growth in construction, manufacturing and retail sales fell off this spring.</p>
        <p>Market analysts said such data provided signs that the Federal Reserve's six interest-rate increases in less than a year were finally having an impact on slowing the economy, which means the Fed may be close to ending its aggressive tightening. Fed policy makers next meet June 27-28, followed by an Aug. 22 session.</p>
        <p>''Bad numbers are good numbers for the market at this point,'' said A. C. Moore, chief investment strategist for Dunvegan Associates.</p>
        <p>The battered technology sector was especially encouraged. In fact, the Nasdaq composite index wrapped up its best week in history, rising 608.27 points, or 19 percent, to 3,813.38. The Dow Jones industrial average soared 495.52 points, or 4.8 percent, to 10,794.76.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moore predicted that stocks, particularly technology issues, would continue to recover in the weeks ahead. ''They have found their floor,'' he said.</p>
