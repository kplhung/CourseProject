        <p>IN yoga classes from New York to San Francisco, a voice emanates from compact disc players, leading students through their salutes to the sun. The tone is deep, open, American. The music accompanying it pushes ahead like rock 'n' roll, stirred by African rhythms or prettified by a New Age flute. But this sound is not merely for relaxation or exercise.</p>
        <p>The words are Sanskrit, the ancient invocational tongue of India, and the repetitive melodies stimulate a trancelike mental openness. This is the gospel sound of American yoga, expressed in the music of Krishna Das.</p>
        <p>''Everybody loves music,'' Krishna Das, the chanting master who was born Jeffrey Kagel in Long Island in 1947, said in a recent interview at Les Deux Gamins in Greenwich Village. ''Here's an offering of music that's also claiming to be a spiritual practice. It's not heavy, it's not hard, you don't have to sit there not moving all day as somebody beats you on the back with a stick. But it is meditation.''</p>
        <p>The tuneful route to spiritual bliss is surging in popularity. Organized chanting sessions, called kirtans, happen weekly throughout New York. Even at gyms like Crunch, many classes begin and end with a short chant. No longer are cries of ''Hare Krishna'' uttered only in airports by saffron-robed ecstatics. Like bindi jewels and the writings of the Dalai Lama, yogic hymns are  making enlightenment accessible.</p>
        <p>Krishna Das is an unassuming icon of this trend. A practitioner of Bhankti yoga, the devotional limb of mystical Hinduism, he has fashioned himself into a ''kirtan wallah,'' or traveling singer, bringing divine praises to gatherings nationwide. Yoga Journal recently called him ''The Pavarotti of Kirtan.'' His most popular album, ''Pilgrim Heart'' (1996), has sold nearly 50,000 copies. He has sung with Sting and given instruction to Madonna. He tours constantly; in May alone he led 14 events, including the keynote address at the national ''New American Yoga'' conference at Kripalu Yoga Center in Lenox, Mass. And Triolka Records, the label he cofounded 10 years ago, has been significant in building the bridge between world and New Age music.</p>
        <p>Meditation beads around his neck, cellular phone at the ready, Krishna Das might seem to some to be a cultural interloper who has found a way to turn his hippie ideals into a profitable venture. Yet he remains unpretentious. It's easy to believe his claim of doing what comes naturally.</p>
        <p>''I think it's perfectly natural that a Westerner should go to India, soak it up and come back and then work with the forms they've absorbed in this lifetime, which for me was Little Anthony and the Imperials and rock 'n' roll,'' said this self-described fan of the Clash. ''I've never formally trained in Indian classical music, which is an extraordinarily subtle and amazing technique. I've never had the discipline, and now I just don't have the time. I want to sing to God, I want to sing to my own heart. And I want to be open.''</p>
        <p>Unfettered enthusiasm is the source of Krishna Das's art. His kirtans could make an atheist drop his guard. At a recent session at the Jivamukti Yoga Studio in downtown Manhattan that attracted about 200 people, the genial leader began with a joke about missing ''The Sopranos'' and a gentle reminder that this music wasn't just entertainment, but prayer. He cued his band, which included Jim Donovan, the percussionist for Rusted Root, the Bansuri flute virtuoso Steve Gorn and a crowd of other players and singers on both Indian and Western instruments. ''I'll sing a line and all y'all sing along,'' he said, beginning an invocation to the monkey deity Hanuman.</p>
        <p>Krishna Das pumped his harmonium, and the full band added heft to the litanies. Although one skeptical newcomer leaned over to a stranger and opined, ''He's the Studio 54 of chanting,'' most attendees let the proverbial spirit take them, whether they believed in the chants or simply relished the strong, simple melody.</p>
        <p>''I try to loosen people up,'' Krishna Das said later. ''This isn't a course in how to chant. We're chanting! It's a hootenanny.''</p>
        <p>Sharon Gannon, a founder of Jivamukti, said: ''K.D. has just kept developing. He's like the tortoise in the story of the tortoise and the hare. He keeps plodding along, and now he's won the race.''</p>
        <p>Krishna Das's journey reflects the twisted path of yoga in America, which evolved from a health craze to a part of the countercultural dream in the 1960's, quietly developed in the 70's and 80's and has returned to full force within the holistic lifestyles of the new century. A midcareer period of retreat primed the singer for his current, fortuitously timed comeback.</p>
        <p>Like so many young people in the 1960's, Jeffrey Kagel turned to Eastern practice out of frustration and hope. ''There was a tremendous naivete,'' he said. ''We thought we could change the world. A lot of people got very discouraged and felt very betrayed by life, when things didn't change just because they took acid.''</p>
        <p>Playing in bands and on his own, Krishna Das sought freedom in folk music, the blues and even heavy metal. A new route opened up when he met Ram Dass, whose inspirational books about life under the guidance of the guru Neem Karoli Baba had taken the counterculture by storm. In 1970, he traveled to India.</p>
        <p>''In India, they didn't see me as a failed, depressed rock 'n' roller,'' he said. ''They saw me as a devotee of the god, and they honored that tremendously.''</p>
        <p>The stimulating environment and the guidance of Neem Karoli Baba led the newly dubbed Krishna Das to a new musical challenge. ''I sang with guys who were chanting, for hours, sometimes 10 hours at a time,'' he said. ''When I first came, I couldn't even keep a beat. They gave me this big cymbal. And one guy would go like this,'' he said, clapping his hands together, ''and then he'd take his hand away and I'd mess up. And he'd do it again. All day for three days. At the end of a few days I had it.''</p>
        <p>Krishna Das lived blissfully at Neem Karoli Baba's temple until 1973, when he returned to America at the guru's behest. His teacher called him back about a year later, but Krishna Das, who was making money and enjoying a new romance, hesitated. Within months, Neem Karoli Baba died.</p>
        <p>''It ran over me like a truck,'' he said. ''I thought I had blown it, and could never be happy.''</p>
        <p>Fighting off depression, Krishna Das pursued music in Northern California. He played in an early world-fusion band, Amazing Grace, with Jai Uttal, another popular modernizer of kirtan. He toured with Ram Dass, singing before the writer spoke, an activity he continues today.</p>
        <p>He also got into the music business with two friends, Mitchell Markus and Paul Sloman. They founded Living Proof Records in the late 1970's to record jazz elders they admired. The label, later renamed Triloka, shifted toward world music with successful releases from the sarod master Ali Akhbar Khan and the Tahitian Choir.</p>
        <p>''The label's identity came out of Krishna Das's and my experience with India,'' Mr. Markus said by telephone from a recording studio in Los Angeles, where the label is still based. ''The idea is to keep intact the culture from which the music comes, and yet make it completely accessible to a Western audience.''</p>
        <p>As Triloka grew, Krishna Das sequestered his own talent. He sang only in small circles of friends. He intermittently returned to India, seeking relief from his torment over Neem Karoli Baba's death.</p>
        <p>Then in 1994, living in New York, he realized that singing with strangers might actually help him. ''I knew I was hiding stuff,'' he said. ''I had to sing with people in order to reach it.''</p>
        <p>One night he attended a Jai Uttal concert at Jivamukti. He noticed that the studio offered satsangs, or religious services. ''The next morning I got a phone call,'' Ms. Gannon remembered. ''This man said: 'Hello, my named is Jeffrey Kagel, and I also used to chant. I know you have evening satsangs. I could do some chanting after you talk.' He was such a nice, humble guy. I said, 'O.K., why don't you come by this afternoon and we'll talk this over.' I left for the yoga center, and when I arrived, there he was!''</p>
        <p>The Monday night kirtans soon drew a crowd, including musicians and vocalists whom Krishna Das nicknamed his ''posse.'' He was alternately pleased and bothered by his newfound fame. Back in India in 1995, he prayed for inner reconciliation. To his surprise, in the flash of recognition that seekers call satori, he attained it. After that, the pieces of his vocation rapidly fell into place.</p>
        <p>He has released three albums since 1995, the most recent of which is the double disc ''Live on Earth . . . for a Limited Time Only.'' Krishna Das says he can deal with such attention now, neither recoiling from it nor letting it rule his ego.</p>
        <p>''What's changed in him is what's different about a lot of us who went over to India,'' Mr. Markus said. ''Major things like developing a real sense of humor and an awareness of the poignancy of any moment in your life. He's really becoming who he is, without second thoughts about it.''</p>
        <p>Yet even the peace Krishna Das has found, and his subsequent success, has not tempered a certain melancholy within. Sharon Gannon thinks it is the force behind his growing renown.</p>
        <p>''One of my teachers in India told me that for a song to be a really good song it must have the element of sadness,'' she said. ''It has to wrench your heartstrings, that yearning. Unfulfilled desire. Krishna Das has that. He still is the blues singer.''</p>
