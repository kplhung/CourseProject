        <p>SPRING is a good time to inspect your chimney. An early inspection alerts you to any defects and allows plenty of time to schedule and perform maintenance.</p>
        <p>Naturally, you will have to climb on the roof to make the inspection. Climbing onto a high roof can be dangerous, especially if it has a steep pitch. Wait for a calm, dry day for the inspection. Wear rubber-soled shoes; do not attempt to climb on a wet roof. Make sure that you understand, and follow, all ladder safety rules.</p>
        <p>When moving about on the roof, watch for loose or torn shingles, moss, wet leaves or debris. If you are unsure of yourself on a high roof, call a professional to do the job.</p>
        <p>Start at the top of the chimney with the crown. The crown is the masonry cap that covers and protects the rest of the chimney. If it is cracked or broken, rainwater will seep into the core holes of the brick. The thaw-freeze cycle that occurs during the winter months will cause the water to expand and eventually split the chimney apart. A professional contractor should replace a cracked or damaged crown.</p>
        <p>Also inspect the gap between the cap and flue. If there is a wide gap, it should be caulked to prevent water seepage. Use concrete caulk for this. It is available in cartridges at home centers.</p>
        <p>It is easy to apply the caulk; simply insert the cartridge in a caulking gun and draw a bead around the flue. Smoothing the bead may be a little difficult because the caulk is very sticky. You can smooth it by dragging an ice cube across the surface of the bead.</p>
        <p>Look carefully at the bricks and mortar in the chimney for cracks and crumbling brick or mortar. Mortar that is cracked or deteriorating should be chiseled out and replaced. This repair technique is called repointing, or tuckpointing.</p>
        <p>If you decide to repoint, you will need a few tools: a cold chisel (it should be narrower than the mortar joint), a two-pound sledgehammer, a mason's trowel (for mixing and holding mortar), a pointing tool (for pushing the mortar into the joint), a jointing tool (for shaping the contour of the joint) and a stiff-bristle brush to remove residual mortar. You'll also need the proper safety gear: safety goggles for your eyes, heavy-duty gloves for your hands and work shoes.</p>
        <p>Of course, you'll need new mortar. You can make this by mixing type N masonry cement and masonry sand (do not use beach sand). There are different types of masonry cement (designated by the letters M, S, N and O, indicating the varying proportions of their ingredients) but type N is a good, all-purpose mix. The sand is an aggregate that softens the mortar and allows it to expand and contract with the surrounding bricks.</p>
        <p>Start by chiseling out the deteriorated mortar from between the bricks to a depth of about two and a half times the width of the joint. Work carefully to remove the old mortar without damaging the surrounding brick.</p>
        <p>After you've chiseled out all the old mortar, wash the joints by brushing them with the stiff-bristled brush dipped in water. Next, mix the mortar ingredients with the trowel; it's best to do this on the ground and carry the mix to the roof in a small bucket. Mix three parts sand to one part masonry cement and mix only as much as you can work with in about 30 minutes. Dry-mix these ingredients first before adding water. Add water slowly until the mix has the consistency of a stiff paste.</p>
        <p>Position a ball of mortar on the bottom of the trowel. Use the pointing tool to push it from the trowel into the joint. Allow the mortar to harden slightly, then shape the contour by running the joint tool along the joint. Shape the vertical joints first, then the horizontal ones. Use the stiff-bristled brush to remove excess mortar.</p>
        <p>After you have repointed the brick, allow time for the mortar to dry, then seal the entire chimney by brushing the surfaces with a sealant.</p>
        <p>A good chimney sealant is a water-repellent called siloxane (one brand is called Sure Klean and is available from building suppliers); it repels water but allows chimney gases to escape through the masonry. Siloxane is combustible, so read the package directions carefully first. Turn off all gas appliances and extinguish open flames before treating the chimney.</p>
        <p>You should also install a chimney cover if your chimney doesn't have one. Chimney covers keep out water that could rust the damper and metal flue liner. They also keep birds and small animals from nesting in your chimney.</p>
        <p>To find a dealer, look in the Yellow Pages under ''Chimney Materials.'' Be sure to measure the furnace flue and flue liner before ordering the cover.</p>
