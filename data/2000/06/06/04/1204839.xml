        <p>Having finally achieved full NATO membership only a year ago, Poland finds itself caught awkwardly between its European aspirations and its loyalty to the United States.</p>
        <p>European officials, led by France, have pressured Poland to be more accommodating toward a new European defense initiative, asking the Poles whether they really want to be members of the European Union or not, senior Polish officials say.</p>
        <p>''We have been told, 'you have to make a choice -- be with the U.S. or with us if you want to be Europeans,' '' said a senior Polish official. ''This poses a serious challenge for our foreign policy, and it could be another pretext or justification for delaying Polish accession to the European Union.''</p>
        <p>While defense issues will not decide the fate of Poland's application to join the European Union, Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek has said privately that he feels torn between his Francophilia and his concept of Poland's national interests, which call for a strong American military presence in Europe and an undiminished NATO alliance.</p>
        <p>What is at issue is the European Strategic Defense Plan, an effort pressed by France -- and formally supported by the United States -- to create a solely European armed force of 60,000 troops capable of being deployed quickly to a place like Kosovo, for example, and then staying for a year.</p>
        <p>Authorized in December, the force would be the European Union's military arm, with its own command staff, and would give the nascent federal Europe the force to back up what is supposed to become a single foreign and defense policy. The main civilian charged with making this a reality by 2003 is the former NATO secretary general, Javier Solana, a Spaniard respected in Washington.</p>
        <p>But Poland, as a NATO member that wants to be in the European Union, feels that it has been frozen out of the planning for this European military arm that it will have to join later. And many Polish officials believe the reason for this exclusion is that France believes Poland will act as a Trojan horse for American preferences inside the new grouping.</p>
        <p>Given Poland's history of conflict with Russia, Poland is deeply skeptical about a European defense that does not keep the United States intricately involved, with its superior force, technology, intelligence and nuclear might.</p>
        <p>''We simply don't believe that Europe without the United States is safe,'' a senior Polish official said. ''If this century has taught us anything, it's that Europe and North America are one strategic space.''</p>
        <p>Poland is also being dragged unhappily into the trans-Atlantic debate over American plans for a missile-defense system, which Europeans worry will separate their security from America's, at least in American minds. On these issues,  the Poles are close to the British, full members of both the European Union and NATO, whom continental Europeans often regard as too close to the United States.</p>
        <p>Although they strongly back the European defense initiative, the British have worked closely with the Poles, arguing for consultation by the 15 full members of the European Union with the six non-European-Union members who are full members of NATO -- Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Turkey, Iceland and Norway. British officials argue that Poland, a large country with a strong military tradition, will be crucial to any new continental force and should be involved in the planning.</p>
        <p>But French officials have made it clear that the planning will be done by current European Union members only. With British prodding, however, the European Union just had its first ''consultations'' with the six other nations, including Turkey, which has been even more vocal than Poland in raising alarms about the possible dilution of NATO.</p>
        <p>Already, a senior Polish official and others said, Poland has been facing French pressure and lobbying on issues ranging from the percentage of European content in domestic broadcasting to vodka trademarks to military procurement decisions. And they say that the French have hinted that membership negotiations on difficult topics like agriculture and the environment will go easier if Poland follows the federalist European line.</p>
        <p>''We're not impressed with this policy of pressure and gestures,'' said another senior Polish official. ''This is a typical European dance around serious issues. And we will not be forced to choose between NATO and the European Union -- both are essential to Poland's future.''</p>
        <p>He grimaced. ''It seems ridiculous to us that the 15 are not taking our experiences and interests into account. The French sometimes push too far and lose touch with reality.''</p>
        <p>French officials here dismiss the accusation of pressure, with one senior diplomat saying, in jest, ''Push them around? We haven't even tried yet!''</p>
        <p>The French official said that the Poles were too quick to run to the Americans to complain about the European defense initiative. ''We told the Poles that this appeal to Washington, making roughly the same case as Turkey, was tactically wrong, and damaged the claim that stems from their history.''</p>
        <p>President Jacques Chirac of France met with Foreign Minister Geremek this spring and reportedly asked him whether Poland wanted to be part of Europe or be ''the 51st state.'' They met again, later, when Mr. Chirac insisted that ''this idea of pressure is not true,'' the French official said. France simply wants to build the new defense corps with current European Union members, he said, ''and when we've decided among ourselves, we will consult, so please be patient and accept being outside for a while.''</p>
        <p>But Polish officials have not been persuaded. One senior Polish official said: ''If we're not involved in the planning, and if our application for the European Union is not acted upon until 2004 or 2005, then we can hardly prepare our forces to take part in the E.S.D.I. That strikes me as counterproductive for the whole initiative.''</p>
        <p>And Mr. Geremek, a pained look on his face, said slowly: ''Because of our traumatic history, we want to belong to both NATO and the European Union. Poland is attached to its sovereignty, and if we can give up some part of it to Europe, it is only to defend our national independence.''</p>
        <p>In Washington, the European initiative has produced the usual schizophrenia: complaints about European unwillingness to ''share the burden,'' and then nervousness whenever the Europeans, traditionally prompted by the French, begin to act independently.</p>
        <p>These tensions are not conducive to further NATO expansion, another senior Polish official said, especially since the likely new candidates will include more strong advocates of Washington's continued, pre-eminent role in NATO. Russian objections to expanding NATO aside, the official said, ''The French fear that if they enlarge NATO they'll get more American Trojan horses.''</p>
        <p>Finding a way through ''the triangle of the United States, the European Union and Russia will be a very subtle task for Polish foreign policy,'' the official said -- ''more difficult than joining NATO.''</p>
        <p>Kosovo proves the logic of a European foreign and security policy capable of action, the official said. ''But we have to preserve the coherence of the NATO alliance and the American umbrella.''</p>
        <p>Jan Kulakowski, Poland's negotiator with the European Union, said: ''We're asked, 'Are you for America or Europe?' It's like choosing your mother or your father.</p>
        <p>''We will not be a Trojan horse for the U.S. in Europe. We are a European country, and we will show our solidarity, which doesn't mean we have to challenge the United States. But on some issues, we'll participate in some decisions of the E.U. that the U.S. won't appreciate.''</p>
