        <p>AS another smog season begins, it's likely that some of the country's most popular national parks, especially in the east, will once again be troubled by haze and smog rivaling the levels in crowded metropolitan areas.</p>
        <p>A booming economy has been increasing production from factories and power plants,  whose pollution blows on the wind to distant peaks in national parks like Acadia in Maine, Shenandoah in Virginia and Great Smoky Mountains in North Carolina and Tennessee. A hiker following the length of the Appalachian Trail this summer, therefore, is likely to encounter some pretty smoggy days.</p>
        <p>On March 8, monitors in Great Smoky Mountains Park, near the southern end of the Appalachian Trail, recorded what the park's air quality officials called extraordinarily early violations of federal smog standards. Last autumn, the monitors documented heavy smog unusually late in the year. Usually, the smog season is concentrated in summer.</p>
        <p>Last summer, Great Smoky recorded 52 days of smog exceeding federal health standards. Acadia recorded worse smog than Boston and Philadelphia. And visibility from Shenandoah's heights has been reduced by a quarter in the last 50 years.</p>
        <p>In a satirical essay in the April issue of Backpacker magazine, Thom Hogan, the editor, writes of traveling the length of the Appalachian Trail 50 years in the future -- starting in January in Georgia to beat the heat and smog on a trip that nowadays typically begins in March. ''Fortunately,'' he fantasizes, ''I'm carrying my battery-powered rebreather, a technology derived from scuba equipment and paid for and refined by the final tobacco-industry settlements with the federal government in 2003.''</p>
        <p>Park advocates say today's reality is grim enough. ''It's a tragedy when the air is dirtier in the places we escape the pollution of the city,'' said Jonathan Birdsong, southeastern regional representative for the Izaac Walton League, a conservation group of hunters and other outdoors enthusiasts, which recently issued a study of the trends.</p>
        <p>The Environmental Protection Agency reported last month that in recent years, the smog trend in some national parks has been running counter to the overall national picture, which has steadily improved. Smog concentrations increased at 17 of 24 National Park Service monitoring sites from 1992 to 1998, the most recent comprehensive data that is available, the agency said.</p>
        <p>The data measures ground-level concentrations of ozone, a chemical that forms smog. Ozone damages living cells, and therefore can harm not only growing plants but also people's lungs.</p>
        <p>''The 1998 levels were particularly high at two parks in the eastern United States, Shenandoah and the Great Smoky Mountains,'' the report said. ''Ozone levels at these sites were the highest in a decade and 30 to 40 percent higher than the national ozone standard.''</p>
        <p>Haze -- not the natural bluish vapors that gave the mountains their name, but the suspended smoky particles that are chemically different from smog -- is also worsening, the report said. ''Eastern visibility impairment on the haziest days has worsened from 1997 to 1998, and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park experienced its worst visibility in more than a decade.''</p>
        <p>More than the view is affected, park advocates say. In a study several years ago by the Appalachian Mountain Club, Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and the Harvard School of Public Health, hikers climbing to the summit of Mount Washington in New Hampshire suffered from less efficient breathing as ozone levels rose. The people who had the worst problems were those with a history of asthma or other lung problems, but even healthy climbers could be affected, the study found.</p>
        <p>And researchers in the Great Smoky Mountains park have documented damage to 30 plant species, including tall milkweed, black cherry and sassafras.</p>
        <p>There are many sources of air pollution in parks. Some are affected even in wintertime by heavy snowmobile use; Yellowstone National Park is phasing out snowmobiles, and other parks are expected to crack down on their use. Cars, of course, crowd many parks in summer.</p>
        <p>But the most persistent problems are caused by industrial pollution from relatively distant sources, especially coal-fired power plants, according to pollution experts.</p>
        <p>In Great Smoky, for example, air quality scientists have found strong correlations between emissions from the Tennessee Valley Authority's power plants and pollution in the park. The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Agency, which has been flying research planes in the area, said pollution patterns are complex, and it implicated Ohio Valley plants as well.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A. has adopted policies that should result in significant reductions in smog in eastern states, including emissions from the T.V.A., in the next several years. The power authority already has taken steps to reduce the generation of smog-creating chemicals, especially in the summer. But at the same time, the authority, which is the largest federal utility in the nation, has been challenging some of the environmental agency's rules in court.</p>
