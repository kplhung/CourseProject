        <p>KURT MASUR and the New York Philharmonic ended another season at Avery Fisher Hall last night with Mahler's Ninth Symphony, one of the great valedictory works in the symphonic repertory. And indeed, goodbyes might seem to be in order, as talk in musical circles centers increasingly on who will replace Mr. Masur as the orchestra's music director.</p>
        <p>Philharmonic representatives traveled to Milan recently to talk terms with Riccardo Muti, and other candidates are said to be waiting in the wings. But often lost in the seeming confusion of the last year or so has been the fact that whoever is selected, the 72-year-old Mr. Masur, who has done so much to restore the orchestra to a lofty international standard of performance since taking it over in 1991, is to remain in place for two more seasons.</p>
        <p>This imposing and politically savvy maestro, who played a significant role in the downfall of the East German regime, is surely no one's idea of a lame duck, and few have ever found it wise to underestimate his determination, staying power or resilience. Yet his ebullience seems to have faded a bit during years of battles with the Philharmonic management. And to a visitor who had not spoken to him at length for years, he seemed subdued in a conversation in his Avery Fisher Hall studio the other day, as he reflected on his achievements in New York and discussed the future. This year he also becomes the principal conductor of the London Philharmonic, and in 2002, he exchanges one music directorship for another, taking over the Orchestre National de France in Paris.</p>
        <p>''The major point for me is still the New York Philharmonic, because I don't want to leave as someone who says, 'I'll say goodbye poco a poco, diminuendo,' '' Mr. Masur said, giving a musical twist to the fate of MacArthur's old soldiers. ''This I never can do, because we are too close together. The players are expecting that I will fight till the last day.''</p>
        <p>Fight with them as well as for them, one suspects, given the tempestuous nature of some of Mr. Masur's rehearsals over the years, especially the early ones. And his tone of voice made clear that he does not intend to disappoint them.</p>
        <p>Justifiably, Mr. Masur, whose annual salary is about $1.3 million, takes great satisfaction in the orchestra's improvement over the last decade. What Zubin Mehta left behind was a group loaded with talent, largely because of his many superb hires, but seemingly bereft of morale. Although Mr. Masur has hired wonderful players himself, including Carter Brey as principal cellist and Sheryl Staples as associate concertmaster, his greatest feat may have been to instill the needed spirit, pride and sense of discipline among the players. What's more, this was not a one-time feat but something that had to be maintained, as became apparent when the orchestra repeatedly lapsed into old bad habits under lenient guest conductors; it still does so on occasion.</p>
        <p>''What I would like to leave behind is this kind of feeling responsible,'' Mr. Masur said, ''this kind of pride to be a member of the New York Philharmonic, to be a member of one of the leading orchestras of the world, as it is now without a doubt, so that the ups and downs are not so dependent on the music director or the director or the board or the money they have.</p>
        <p>''I knew my goals exactly when I came, and it was not easy with the orchestra at the beginning. But as they learned that I was open to them, they started to trust me. We have grown together, and this is the most wonderful thing I have achieved.''</p>
        <p>IN this sense, his greatest satisfaction may have led to his greatest disappointment. ''It disturbed some people,'' Mr. Masur said. ''I was criticized for being too close to the orchestra. Where else should I be as a conductor? My disappointments are not in any direction toward the orchestra. Absolutely not. My disappointment is that it was possible that with a change of chairman of the board, the whole politics of the Philharmonic turned around 180 degrees.''</p>
        <p>This was as close as Mr. Masur came to naming names. Stephen Stamas, who had been the chairman of the orchestra since 1989, was replaced by the present chairman, Paul B. Guenther, in 1996. Deborah Borda was then the executive director of the Philharmonic, having arrived shortly after Mr. Masur in 1991; she left last December to become managing director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. The resulting vacancy has just been filled by Zarin Mehta, the executive director of the Ravinia Festival and Zubin Mehta's younger brother.</p>
        <p>Mr. Masur's relationship with Philharmonic management through the years has been at least as stormy as his relationship with the players ever was. The final battle became public in early 1998, when the board refused to extend his contract the usual three seasons ahead. It was agreed that Mr. Masur would stay until 2002 but that a search for a successor would begin immediately.</p>
        <p>''It was a raw deal with some people,'' Mr. Masur said. ''Decisions were made by three or four people.'' Mr. Masur's view that he got a raw deal is widely shared among players as well as the public. Not that he finds much comfort in such support.</p>
        <p>''It bothers me that this is a free country, and a lot of people don't feel free,'' he said. ''They come to me and say, 'I'm so sorry about what happened, but I have no power.' Maybe they should have gone through the school we went through in East Germany. You had no power, but you had to be brave. And it makes you proud if you always try to say what you think and to say what you believe is useful.''</p>
        <p>At the very least, the timing of the board's action was awkward, for Mr. Masur had resigned his longtime position as Kapellmeister of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra just a year before, ostensibly to devote himself more fully to New York. The conductorial world was not rich in obvious candidates to succeed him, and the Philharmonic did not seem to have anyone particular in mind: certainly no one, it may be said two years later, whom it could pin down quickly.</p>
        <p>''Whatever will happen to the Philharmonic was, in my opinion, not planned very carefully,'' Mr. Masur said. ''I was ready to stay longer. I was ready to go earlier if we found the right person, just to keep things going as they should go. And at the moment we are a little bit between two chairs, as we say in Germany.</p>
        <p>''It is a wonderful achievement of the board that we have a lot of money. We can do nearly everything, and we can do everything in an artistic way. On the other hand, it could have been a closer, more open cooperation. This is my only disappointment, that I found some people who are simply not honest, only looking for their interests, their power.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Guenther, for his part, said, ''If you look at the history of the New York Philharmonic, we have had very few music directors who have served much longer than a decade.'' Indeed, Zubin Mehta, at 13 years, served the longest tenure in this century.</p>
        <p>''Our philosophy is that for a dynamic institution like the Philharmonic, change is often necessary, and this was one of those times,'' Mr. Guenther continued guardedly. ''Kurt Masur has done a spectacular job.'' Philharmonic administrators have also expressed dissatisfaction with perceived limitations in Mr. Masur's repertory, which leans heavily toward the Germanic.</p>
        <p>SO what remains for Mr. Masur to accomplish? He has evidently given up one of his cherished goals: to see a pipe organ installed in Avery Fisher Hall. Although such an option exists in current planning for renovation of the building along with others in Lincoln Center, it seems to be largely theoretical, for the ample cost has not been included in figures bandied about to date.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Masur is still hopeful about setting up a summer home for the orchestra in the Seventh Regiment Armory, across Central Park from Lincoln Center, and establishing a series of informal, adventurous concerts modeled after the London Proms, to attract, especially, a young audience. Although complex negotiations with the various parties controlling the building have repeatedly bogged down, they apparently remain alive.</p>
        <p>''My last goal, even if it doesn't occur until I go away, will be to do the first concert,'' Mr. Masur said, ''an open concert in whatever condition the hall will be in in summertime, to prove that young people will come with the right programming.''</p>
        <p>Before then, some fences may have to be mended. As matters stand now, Mr. Masur has no dates with the Philharmonic -- even as guest, let alone emeritus -- after his departure. ''I offered the Philharmonic some weeks, and the chairman refused,'' he said. ''He told me he had to ask the board. And I haven't been asked until now. So I'll just wait. It's not my step to take.''</p>
        <p>One thing that may help the reconciliation process is the hiring of Zarin Mehta as executive director. Mr. Mehta, a former managing director of the Montreal Symphony, has directed the Ravinia Festival in Highland Park, Ill., the summer home of the Chicago Symphony, since 1990. He has developed a wide network of friends in the business, evidently including Mr. Masur.</p>
        <p>''I spoke to him about taking the job already before I came here,'' Mr. Masur said. ''He is an incredible man, so full of imagination. I will be lucky if I have two years with him.''</p>
        <p>In any case, Mr. Masur will not lack for activity. In addition to his long-term commitments, present and future, he is starting to work again at the Gewandhaus in Leipzig, where he and his wife, Tomoko Sakurai, a professional soprano and former violist, maintain their principal home. They also intend to keep their home in Westchester County, as Mr. Masur continues to pursue his guest-conducting around the world, notably in Israel and Japan, and steps up his activities with young people: teaching, holding master classes and conducting youth orchestras.</p>
        <p>In that eventful year 2002, Mr. Masur plans to celebrate his 75th birthday with a series of concerts at the Philharmonie in Cologne, with the New York Philharmonic, the London Philharmonic, the Israel Philharmonic and, possibly, the Orchestre National de France.</p>
        <p>This series was set in motion by another close friend and colleague, Franz Xaver Ohnesorg, when he was director of the Philharmonie. Mr. Ohnesorg became the executive and artistic director of Carnegie Hall last September, and it is safe to say that so long as he holds that position, New York will not have heard the last of Mr. Masur.</p>
