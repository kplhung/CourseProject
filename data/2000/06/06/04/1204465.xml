        <p>ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY</p>
        <p>By David Sedaris.</p>
        <p>272 pp. Boston:</p>
        <p>Little, Brown &amp; Company. $22.95.</p>
        <p>WHEN he revolutionized nightclub routines in the 1960's by turning the comic spotlight on his own neuroses instead of his mother-in-law's driving skills, there was probably no way that Woody Allen could have predicted, even in his wildest nightmares, the importance of his sociological legacy. At about the same time, Cassius Clay probably had little idea that as Muhammad Ali his public persona would be so enduring and influential. But 40 years on, America's public face has been made over into a sort of Muhammad Allen. We have become a nation of public braggarts, divided either into the camp that noisily inflates its abilities, or the one that just as noisily broadcasts its charming -- and usually phony -- ineptness. In fact, as it turns out, Ali was not unbeatable, and Woody Allen continues to be extremely successful with girls.</p>
        <p>Along with Jerry Seinfeld, the Clintons and almost everybody else in show business, the anecdotalist, public radio personality and child of the 60's David Sedaris has clearly pitched his tent in the Allen camp. His need to hang onto his neuroses permeates his fourth collection of comic pieces -- his previous books were ''Barrel Fever'' (1994), ''Naked'' (1997) and ''Holidays on Ice'' (1997) -- an assortment of frequently very funny, too-often bland and ultimately frustrating essays.</p>
        <p>The first piece in this loosely chronological memoir -- which is divided between Sedaris's childhood in North Carolina, early adulthood in New York and his recent adventures living with his boyfriend Hugh in Paris -- champions his fifth-grade rebellion against a speech therapist who attempted to relieve him of his lisp. Though Sedaris humorously finds ways to thwart her by creating whole sentences without the letter ''s'' in them, his underlying message -- that giving up this lisp would have meant surrendering his individuality -- rings hollow, as does a later rationalization that the therapist's hidden agenda was to de-homosexualize him. Even in this age of Barbara Walters, Tom Brokaw and Rudolph Giuliani, why would anyone fight so hard to retain a speech impediment as a sign of singularity?</p>
        <p>He belittles his jazz-crazed father for forcing him to take guitar lessons (though every parent knows that force is about the only way you can get a child to pick up music), crows about taking speed before an onstage performance, revels in his inability to teach and in his low I.Q. Later, his list of requirements for a male lover smacks of someone clinging to a professional and practiced ''craziness.'' The effort, rather than the result, jumps off the page.</p>
        <p>This is not to say that Sedaris is not a very funny writer. Many lines and several of the premises are brilliant, worthy of our best comic essayists -- Calvin Trillin, Woody Allen, Christopher Buckley, Dave Barry. At his best, he makes you laugh out loud, which indeed may be worth the price of admission. He writes of one sister's addiction to tanning, ''She was what we called a tanorexic. . . . Year after year she arrived at the beach with a base coat that the rest of us could only dream of achieving as our final product.'' Another sister has the definitive rejection of predatory males: ''Thanks for asking, but I'm really not into white guys right now.''</p>
        <p>He moves to France with Hugh and responds to America's constant insistence that ''we're No. 1'' (see the Ali camp, above) by writing, ''The French have decided to ignore our self-proclaimed superiority, and this is translated as arrogance.'' His hilariously cranky French teacher says to him, ''Every day spent with you is like having a Caesarian section.'' For 22 years, Sedaris had no problem falling asleep, because if you ''follow seven beers with a couple of Scotches and a thimble of good marijuana . . . it's funny how sleep just sort of comes on its own.'' And here he is on French food: ''Nothing is more disgusting than a glass of milk, especially French milk, which comes in a box and can sit unrefrigerated for 5 months, at which point it simply turns into cheese and is moved to a different section of the grocery store.''</p>
        <p>His best vignettes -- A Shiner Like a Diamond,'' ''You Can't Kill the Rooster,'' ''I Almost Saw This Girl Get Killed'' -- are completely engaging. In the first, his sister Amy rebels against their father's preoccupation with her appearance (weight, mostly) by impersonating people on the phone with such accuracy that no one can tell her from the impersonatee. The story takes a dangerous turn when Amy, at 12, phones the father and, imitating a 50-year-old acquaintance, propositions him. The sudden switch from humorous character trait to potential incest-adulterer is niftily achieved. The episode begs for deeper exploration -- it's worthy of a novel, or a novella at least. Perversely, Sedaris doesn't recognize his own literary gold mine, probes no further and writes the essay like a sitcom treatment. Because many of the essays turn out to be inconsequential, it's all the more disappointing when he conjures one with substance and then lets it fizzle.</p>
        <p>Much of the difficulty lies in the form itself. Many of these essays began life as individual pieces for magazines or for the public radio program ''This American Life.'' Collected in book form, they need some unifying thread -- subject matter, character, location or even sustained hilarity. Unfortunately, none of these is at work here. Frustratingly, except for his self-deprecation, the character of David Sedaris, though principal to just about every essay, remains elusive. We don't get to know Hugh either, and as potentially interesting as Sedaris's sisters and brother and friends and employers are (I'm smiling ear to ear remembering the Marxist mover he once worked for, who would refuse to move someone's belongings if the person was too successful), the revelations about them are fairly superficial.</p>
        <p>Better editing would have helped, too. Three chapters on the author's difficulties with the French language are repetitive and insufficiently funny to warrant their inclusion. (These might have been condensed into a single, livelier one.) And there are excursions that simply don't come off: riffs on crossword puzzles, his ineptness with computers, restaurant food presentation, how the French love movies, a long passage on boorish Americans on the Metro who don't realize that Sedaris can understand what they're saying, and another on a Southern boob paranoid in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The gifted Sedaris has not been hard enough on himself. At the risk of sounding patronizing, I suspect there is a better writer in there than he is as yet willing to let out.</p>
