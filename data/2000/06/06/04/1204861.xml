        <p>Legislative leaders and Gov. George E. Pataki are in intensive talks on a bill to require less flammable cigarettes -- a compromise to replace a bill Mr. Pataki vetoed late last month -- while the Assembly seriously considers a vote to override that veto.</p>
        <p>With just two weeks left until the Legislature is scheduled to adjourn for the year, the Senate and the Assembly are trying to accommodate concerns raised by Mr. Pataki, whose May 24 veto caught both houses by surprise. The sticking point has been the governor's insistence that along with the bill on fire safety, the Legislature approve his separate measure to combat cigarette bootlegging and Internet sales of cigarettes.</p>
        <p>Members of the Assembly's Democratic majority -- and, less vocally, some Republican legislators -- have accused the governor, a Republican, of inventing reasons to veto the bill and protect tobacco industry interests. They say he ignored or opposed previous bills that dealt with bootlegging and Internet sales.</p>
        <p>''I want to get something done, but the governor's hypocrisy on this issue is making it hard,'' said Assemblyman Alexander B. Grannis, the Manhattan Democrat who was the bill's chief sponsor in the Assembly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grannis is pushing for the Assembly to vote Monday to override the veto, and aides to the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, say he is inclined to agree. The Assembly Democrats will meet Monday to decide. An override vote would be only a symbolic step -- a very public, and relatively rare, slap at the governor -- because the Republican-controlled Senate would not go along. Republicans in the Senate and in the governor's office warn that it could be counterproductive, making a compromise less likely.</p>
        <p>''We are committed to getting a bill this session that the governor can sign,'' said Michael McKeon, the governor's communications director. ''Instead of posturing, let's move forward with good, comprehensive legislation that ensures that we have fire-safe cigarettes and cracks down on bootlegging.''</p>
        <p>In April, the Assembly and the Senate passed a bill that would have made New York the first state to set fire safety standards for cigarettes. The bill would have required that by 2002, all cigarettes sold in the state stop burning when they are not being puffed on. Advocates said the measure would have saved dozens of lives and prevented hundreds of fires each year, and would have put pressure on Congress to adopt national fire safety standards for cigarettes.</p>
        <p>More than a month later, in the last two days he had to act on the bill, the governor raised objections and linked the measure to his bill on bootlegging and Internet sales. He and legislative leaders could not resolve all their differences, and he vetoed the bill.</p>
        <p>Tobacco companies opposed the bill, saying state-by-state standards would be a burden for them. Antitobacco groups say the industry's real concern is that if cigarettes do not burn continuously, smokers might use fewer of them, cutting down on sales. The less flammable cigarettes do not cost more to make.</p>
        <p>Officials in all three camps say agreement on a compromise bill is likely to come soon.</p>
        <p>But the fate of the bill on bootlegging and Internet sales remains murky. Senate leaders have signaled that they will pass the governor's bill, while Assembly Democrats and aides to Mr. Silver say they are not sure what the Assembly will do.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki's bill would prohibit mail-order sellers, like those on the Internet, from shipping cigarettes directly to individuals. Such sales methods evade payment of the state's $1.11-per-pack cigarette tax, the nation's highest, and can be used by minors to buy cigarettes.</p>
        <p>Instead, the governor would require that the seller ship the cigarettes to a licensed retailer, like a corner liquor store. There, the buyer, after showing proof of age and paying the tax, could pick them up.</p>
        <p>Bootlegging, the shipping of cigarettes into New York without paying state taxes, has become a bigger problem since the state doubled its tax in March. Mr. Pataki has said smokers may not like fire-safe cigarettes, encouraging more bootlegging. Backers of the bill dispute that, pointing to tobacco industry studies showing that smokers cannot tell the difference.</p>
        <p>But legislators in both parties say that the governor showed no interest in a variety of antibootlegging bills proposed in recent years, and that he quietly opposed some.</p>
        <p>Last year, Assemblyman Jeff Klein of the Bronx introduced a bill to ban Internet sales of cigarettes, for the same reasons the governor gave for his bill this year. The administration sent him a letter opposing his bill, calling it illegal, but giving no indication that the governor shared any of the concerns about Internet sales. The bill passed, 148 to 2, but died in the Senate.</p>
