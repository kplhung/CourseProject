        <p>THERE'S no need to fiddle in your pocket for loose change if you want a Coke on the streets of downtown Prague. Simply walk up to a Coca-Cola vending machine and point your mobile telephone at it.</p>
        <p>Punch a few buttons on your phone and bang, a cold bottle clatters down the chute and 20 Czech Koruny, about 50 cents, is charged on your mobile phone bill.</p>
        <p>As consumer spending in the former Communist bloc has risen, so has the use of mobile phones: in some countries as many as one in four households now owns one. But the creaky banking system inherited from Communism has left Central and Eastern Europe mostly cash economies. Credit cards and checks are seldom used, and both merchants and consumers are deeply fearful of losing their life savings to credit-card fraud.</p>
        <p>Now, with the advent of sophisticated wireless technologies, improved data security and increasingly versatile handsets, Eastern Europe -- and the Czech Republic, in particular -- are at the forefront of a movement to put e-commerce in the hands of consumers. The result is m-commerce, for mobile. Moving far beyond the quick Coke, companies like Nokia and Citigroup want to turn mobile phones into virtual credit cards.</p>
        <p>''People perceive mobiles as trusted personal devices,'' said Jari Paakkarinen, of Nokia Telecommunications, the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer, which is using the highly competitive Czech mobile phone market to test new technology. ''You eat with it, you rest with it. It's an extension of your personality, so it's a very short step to trust it to pay with it.''</p>
        <p>M-commerce is likely to take off much more rapidly in Europe, especially the Czech Republic, than in the United States. Although some former Communist countries lack readily available wired telephones, most of Europe has mobile networks that are  several generations more advanced and more secure than the older United States systems. And most European systems function across entire countries, not just several cities or states.</p>
        <p>In the United States, the widespread use of checks and credit cards reduces the need for a new payment system. And Americans would be more likely than Europeans to see the spread of m-commerce as a threat to their privacy.</p>
        <p>But Central Europe lacks the sophisticated database of consumer credit that card issuers require. Akshaya Bhargava, general manager of Citibank's Czech operations, says that the bank is instead arranging, by this fall, for retailers to accept payment by mobile telephone for goods sold on their Web sites.</p>
        <p>The Czech Republic's 10.5 million people already own more than 2 million mobile phones and pay their bills religiously. But credit cards have hardly made a dent, with few Czech adults holding them.</p>
        <p>Nor do Czechs use checks. Instead, most use A.T.M. cards to withdraw money, then pay their bills and make their purchases in cash. Czechs commonly pay for kitchen furniture, airline tickets and even new cars with wads of bills.</p>
        <p>But merchants complain that cash transactions encourage theft and that customers often forgo purchases because they simply do not have enough cash in hand.</p>
        <p>The prophets of m-commerce, here and around the world, therefore, see a double boon: The phone will replace or pre-empt the credit card, giving merchants authorization to immediately debit a shopper's bank account or add the charges to a phone bill. It can also become the prime means of gaining access to the Internet, allowing consumers to browse stripped-down Web sites especially tailored to small mobile phone displays. Only about 7 percent of Czechs have regular access to the Internet at home or work.</p>
        <p>The m-commerce revolution depends on a series of technologies meant to bring information from the Web to screens not much larger than a watch face. The current technology, called Wireless Application Protocol, is seen as only the first step toward high-speed data transmission for mobile phones that will receive a constant flow of news bulletins, stock prices or suggestions for nearby restaurants, as determined by the nearest transmitter.</p>
        <p>With an average monthly income of around $341, not many Czechs are likely to charge a new Lexus on their mobile phone. But Jack Schrantz, founder of Albumcity.cz, an Internet record shop, says he expects compact discs to sell well. ''It matches the demographics here -- it's the young and tech-savvy who buy CD's,'' Mr. Schrantz said.</p>
        <p>Several European airlines and banks are already making plans to extend m-commerce. Finnair and Lufthansa allow passengers to check for delays and change their reservations with Web-enabled telephones.  Over the next two to three years, Lufthansa plans to offer everything from ticket purchases to check-in.</p>
        <p>Banks in several European nations also are allowing customers to use telephones and the Internet to make transfers, check account balances and spend cash downloaded into an ''electronic wallet.'' Others see the technology going even further. At Globopolis (www.globopolis.com), a collection of regularly updated city guides to major European cities, mobile phone surfers some time this year will be able to not only find a restaurant, cinema or nightclub, but to make a reservation and pay for tickets, and in some cases, even meal bills.</p>
        <p>As with many an Internet business, however, it remains unclear how m-businesses will generate revenue and profits. Banner advertisements simply cannot fit on phones.</p>
        <p>For now, the airtime that callers burn up while browsing is the main source of revenue for mobile phone operators. But competition and further generations of technology could replace charges by the minute with flat monthly rates, leaving the operators looking for a new model.</p>
        <p>PROFITS from m-transactions are often small: hi-technology Coke machines will not make anybody rich. ''The question with micropayments is how you split commissions: There's not much there,'' said Robert Chvatal, the marketing director of Radio Mobil, whose Paegas mobile telephone service, provided in a partnership with Deutsche Telekom, is the second-largest in the Czech Republic with nearly one million subscribers.</p>
        <p>Both Paegas and its larger rival, EuroTel, whose partners are Bell Atlantic and Media One International, say they may eventually make their money much as Visa and American Express do, by charging merchants a percentage on every transaction.</p>
        <p>EuroTel and Paegas count on Web traffic to be dominated by the mobile telephone, not the personal computer, or even palmtops. ''Many of these customers simply cannot or will not invest in a home PC, so the ability to get to the content and applications of the Internet via the mobile is very attractive,'' said Mike Burns, EuroTel's marketing director. ''What's in it for us is to be essentially the primary provider of Internet services in this country.''</p>
