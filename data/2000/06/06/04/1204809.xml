        <p>TheStreet.com E-Commerce Index of 20 stocks is down 51.2 percent year to date, but according to Anthony Noto, 32, the consumer electronic-commerce analyst at Goldman Sachs, the going is likely to just get tougher for some e-tailers.</p>
        <p>In a research note issued Wednesday, Mr. Noto said that at least 10 of 32 prominent Internet retailers would most likely have to figure out a way to increase their cash reserves by the second half of 2001. If they do not, he said in an interview, they face the likelihood of surrendering their independence.</p>
        <p>Specifically, Mr. Noto said that those that will most likely have to raise more cash are Streamline.com, PlanetRx, Pets,  Mothernature.com, HomeGrocer, Garden.com, Fogdog.com, Egghead.com, Drugstore.com, CDNow, Buy.com and EToys.</p>
        <p>Last week's research note followed an earlier report, published in December, in which Mr. Noto first broached the likelihood that some e-tailers' cash burn rate -- the speed at which they spend available capital -- would require them to gain access to the capital markets. At the time, he suggested that at least 14 of the 32 e-tailers in the report would soon have to secure additional capital. Seven of them have already done so.</p>
        <p>''There's a lot of uncertainty as to which of these is is going to survive,'' Mr. Noto said. ''The markets are very capital constrained and many of these companies are going to need to access capital.''</p>
        <p>But just because an e-tailer will need more capital does not mean it is necessarily in dire trouble, Mr. Noto added. He has divided the e-tailers into three tiers, based on their likelihood for success.</p>
        <p>First-tier companies are category leaders like Amazon.com; Priceline.com, the shopping service; and eBay, the auction house. Among other things, they are likely to have large potential markets, a clear  path to profitability, strong management and distinct marketing approaches. Such companies should not have trouble raising additional capital in the future. So the possibility that eToys is likely to need to return to the cash trough is not a major cause for concern, Mr. Noto said.</p>
        <p>By contrast, second-tier companies have ''slight'' deficiencies in their businesses, while third-tier companies ''are less likely to be successful as stand-alone companies,'' as Mr. Noto's note puts it. ''We believe Tier 2 and 3 companies that require financing in 2000 will have difficulty raising capital,'' it concludes.</p>
        <p>Still, it is probably wise not to write any of these predictions in stone. ''These things change dynamically every three months,'' Mr. Noto said.</p>
        <p>By the by, none of this downbeat analysis means that Mr. Noto is negative on e-tailing as a whole. His favorite stocks -- Tier 1 companies all -- are eBay, Amazon, Priceline and Webvan, an online grocery firm.</p>
