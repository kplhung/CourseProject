        <p>SOME Americans know immediately, rattling the number off with a healthy braggadocio. Others have to ponder for a while, count on fingers, use a pencil. ''Uh, can I consult a map?'' they say, or later, ''Does just being in an airport count?'' Others, knocking off the entire list, are so proud of the fact that they arrange to have it listed in their obituaries: ''Jane Doe loved to travel, and was particularly proud of having visited all 50 states.''</p>
        <p>And they should be proud, for making it to all 50 states in a lifetime is the great American travel goal, one that's considerably more difficult than it sounds (and all but impossible to accomplish in a single trip). It's a big country, of course, and there are all kinds of awkward corners and out-of-the-way tiers -- and then you're faced with those expensive leaps to include Alaska or Hawaii. Even a shrewd character like Richard Nixon, with minions to do his plotting,  had trouble keeping his pledge of visiting all 50 states during the 1960 presidential race, and historians still speculate that the time wasted in accomplishing this rash feat helped cost him the election.</p>
        <p>My own count, in late middle age, is 36 states visited -- not a bad figure, though many have better, and I suppose I have a reasonable chance of making it to all 50, if I can persuade myself the long flight to Hawaii will be worth what it does to my bad back. For a novelist trying to make sense of the country he lives in, it is a worthwhile goal; last year, embarrassed that I had never seen California, I flew the family out to San Francisco and drove north, knocking off Oregon while we were at it, then driving across the Columbia so the kids could add Washington, which my wife and I already had bagged, to their own growing lists.</p>
        <p>One moment from the trip stands out. Driving north along the coast, we crossed from California into Oregon, braked a bit more precipitously than we should have, backed up on the shoulder and parked. Just as visiting all 50 states is the great American travel goal, then the great American travel picture is the family posed under a ''Welcome to'' sign -- in this case, ''Welcome to Oregon.''</p>
        <p>This is trophy hunting American-style -- the visual proof of yet another one-50th tucked under your belt. While we were the only ones parked there, we noticed the ground under the sign was trampled with footprints and littered with film wrappers, making it easy to imagine, at the height of summer, a whole line of vacationing families waiting their chance to pose.</p>
        <p>We live right on the border of New Hampshire and Vermont, so we often see aggressive state baggers dart over the border and back again. Once, crossing our local bridge by bike, I came upon a big R.V. from Missouri stopped halfway across. ''This New Hampshire?'' the driver asked.</p>
        <p>I hesitated. Where Vermont leaves off and New Hampshire begins is a complicated story, having to do with where the mean high-water mark is on the Connecticut River, complicated negotiations undertaken at the time of Vermont's admission to the union, various floodings caused by power dams, and -- perhaps most important -- where the most convenient place was for the highway crew to erect the ''Welcome to New Hampshire'' sign.</p>
        <p>''Yes,'' I said, keeping it simple.</p>
        <p>The driver looked out the windshield, squinted, appraised the roughly three quarters of a square mile of New Hampshire visible (I remember him leaning forward to pat his dashboard, as if congratulating his vehicle in having made it), then, having seen what he wanted to see, and having added another state to his list, he reversed gears toward Vermont, speeding back to the interstate, on his way to somewhere else.</p>
        <p>But I shouldn't make fun of him. My own tally is a bit soft around the edges, including as it does three states -- Georgia, Minnesota and Texas -- that I've only visited by being in one of their airports. Does this count? In a literal sense it does, but as far as getting a sense of a place, airports are useless; yes, there are souvenir caps and T-shirts from the local pro teams, and yes, you can buy lobsters in the Portland, Me., airport and salmon at the one in Portland, Ore., but that's about the only state difference airports display. As a state bagger, I can put Georgia, Minnesota and Texas on my list, but only with very large asterisks.</p>
        <p>Even dicier is the question of whether a state can be included if you've only flown over it, traveled through its air space. I've never actually set foot in Nevada, but I've flown over it at least twice, on clear days when a good part of the state was visible.</p>
        <p>Pressing your face to the window, staring down, you can get a pretty good sense of a state (if the pilot helps you by announcing where you are), not the details perhaps, but the geographic sweep. With Nevada, this included the huge lonely expanse, the dry alkali lakes, the trackless mountains, and out the corner of the window, the sprawl of Las Vegas, looking like -- the comparison is inevitable -- little white dice tossed by a reckless gambler haphazardly across the desert.</p>
        <p>As time goes on, as my tally of states gradually increases because of business trips, vacations and an occasional deliberate foray just to bag one, I suppose I'll eventually achieve all 50. I still have a nagging curiosity about the ones I haven't seen.</p>
        <p>Take New Mexico for instance -- there's a certain tormenting hollow in me whenever I read of it or hear it mentioned. The state lies slabbed across my imagination in a sketchy mural, the center vivid enough, but the corners fuzzy and dark. I see adobe houses cheek by jowl with ancient cliff dwellings stenciled with the words Albuquerque, Santa Fe, Los Alamos, peopled with ghostly conquistadores and seraped Mexicans and J. Robert Oppenheimer and Indians who are geniuses in silver and turquoise . . . and yet I know this probably has very little to do with the reality of New Mexico, and that I better get myself there someday so the mural takes on some substance, some detail, some depth.</p>
        <p>Some tough states remain: somehow I've missed Louisiana, and with all due respect to our president, Arkansas is not on my list. And North Dakota -- is there any harder state to achieve? Mount Rushmore lures people to South Dakota, but the large rectangular slab to its north sits well out of the path to almost anywhere, which means, as far as I'm concerned, it must be one of the real treasures worth bagging.</p>
        <p>Others mention Idaho, which can be elusive, but I've gone fly-fishing there, and Nebraska. One friend, further along than I am and determined to build his list, is making a special pilgrimage this summer to nab Kansas.</p>
        <p>So that's my great American travel ambition, visiting all 50 states. I get the sense that, pulling it off, all the wild and disordered bits of America I've garnered over the years, the sights, the sounds, the feel of it, its very grain -- these clues to a national character divvied up into 50 distinct portions -- will finally come together in a grand flash of understanding that allows me to embrace America in toto and thereby make it mine.</p>
