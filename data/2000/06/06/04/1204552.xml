        <p>Best Bet</p>
        <p>Since the community chorus is 50 years old, a concert to ''Celebrate the Best of the Babylon Chorale'' could cover a lot of musical ground. So when the group ends its anniversary season Saturday at 7:30 p.m. at the Van Nostrand Theater on the Brentwood campus of Suffolk Community College, the pop favorites, Broadway show tunes, folk songs, hymns and spirituals that the ensemble, directed by Timothy Jenks, will perform should provide a kind of quick course on the last five decades of choral music. A reception follows the concert (516) 221-3211.</p>

        <p>Best Bet</p>
        <p>Since the community chorus is 50 years old, a concert to ''Celebrate the Best of the Babylon Chorale'' could cover a lot of musical ground. So when the group ends its anniversary season Saturday at 7:30 p.m. at the Van Nostrand Theater on the Brentwood campus of Suffolk Community College, the pop favorites, Broadway show tunes, folk songs, hymns and spirituals that the ensemble, directed by Timothy Jenks, will perform should provide a kind of quick course on the last five decades of choral music. A reception follows the concert (516) 221-3211.</p>
        <p>Still Singing</p>
        <p>Other choral groups get into the swing of things this week, too. Today, the Long Island Singers Society, backed by a small orchestra, offers the Mozart ''Requiem'' and Handel's ''Second Chandos Anthem'' at 3 p.m. at the Sea Cliff Methodist Church on Downing Avenue (516) 676-6598. On Tuesday, the United Choral Society invites the public to sing along in a free ''Summer Sing'' featuring Mendelssohn's ''Elijah.'' Scores will be available before the concert, which is at 8 p.m. at the Hewlett-Woodmere Library on Broadway in Hewlett (516) 781-3552.</p>
        <p>Also on Tuesday at 8 p.m. at St. Peter's Episcopal Church on South Country Road in Bay Shore, the New Century Singers, an ensemble of members and friends of the lesbian and gay community on the Island, perform their ''Fifth Annual Pride Concert.'' The concert features the world premiere of ''Born to Manifest the Glory,'' a work by Elaine B. Kirkland of Port Jefferson, who was commissioned to write the work by the ''Millennium Gala Festival,'' to be held in San Jose, Calif., in July (631) 363-2605.</p>
        <p>Honoring Frank O'Hara</p>
        <p>A major force in the literary world that flourished in New York in post-World War II, Frank O'Hara actually wore two hats. Besides being a prize-winning poet, he was also a respected art critic and curator at the Museum of Modern Art. His two worlds were often intertwined. And ''In Memory of My Feelings: Frank O'Hara and American Art,'' an exhibition that opens Saturday at the Parrish Art Museum in Southampton, this kinship is explored.</p>
        <p>In its only East Coast venue, the exhibition, organized by the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, features more than 100 works by 26 artists linked to O'Hara from 1950 to 1966, a key period in American cultural history.</p>
        <p>The artists include Willem de Kooning, Jane Freilicher, Philip Guston, Grace Hartigan, Jasper Johns, Lee Krasner, Robert Motherwell, Hans Namuth, Claes Oldenburg, Jackson Pollock and Fairfield Porter. Their works on display either influenced O'Hara's poetry or were inspired by it.</p>
        <p>The opening reception on Saturday includes ''Friends of Frank O'Hara: A Conversation'' with Ms. Freilicher; Joseph LeSueur, a writer; Bill Berkson, a poet-critic; and the show's curator, Russell Ferguson, at 5 p.m., and ''Frank O'Hara: Poetry and Painting,'' a talk by Kenneth Koch, a poet, at 7 p.m. The museum is on Job's Lane (631) 283-2118.</p>
        <p>Horrors</p>
        <p>''The Rocky Horror Show'' takes up residence at the Cultural Arts Playhouse in Old Bethpage on Saturday. With ''Time Warp,'' ''Science Fiction'' and ''Sweet Transvestite,'' the cult favorite will be performed, for adults, at midnight on Saturdays through Aug. 26 at the theater on Old Bethpage Road (516) 694-3330.</p>
        <p>Not to be outdone, Theater Three in Port Jefferson brings its version of the classic to its stage on July 15 for a monthlong run. (631) 928-9100.</p>
        <p>Colonial Life</p>
        <p>Colonial life and warfare come to life on the Island Saturday in a most unusual way. In Oyster Bay, ''British troops'' -- Queen's Rangers, Highlanders and Hessians -- will once more occupy Raynham Hall and its grounds on West Main Street. From noon to 5 p.m., they will demonstrate cooking, soldier life and military drills. Inside the museum, a hand-sewn American flag, circa 1816 to 1817, with 17 stripes and 19 stars, will be on exhibit, along with the current show, ''The Altar of Gastronomy: Kitchen Items from the Collection of Raynham Hall Museum, 1750-1880'' (516) 922-6808. Meanwhile, miles away, in Mastic Beach at the William Floyd Estate, which belonged to a patriot, the New York Third Regiment will show how the rebels lived and made war. From 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., the re-enacters will go through drills, do camp cooking and even hold a fashion show (631) 399-2030.</p>
        <p>All's Fair</p>
        <p>This week's schedule is loaded with fairs and festivals. If big -- and commercial -- is what you yearn, then the Nassau County Fair, with its 110-foot-high Ferris wheel and other rides; ''Zebby's Zoo''; ''Super Stock Car Racers''; ''Thunderhawk Big Cat Encounter''; ''Raptor Project''; ''Hambone Racing Pigs''; and ''Fearless Flores Circus and Thrill Show,'' should be ideal. The fair, to benefit the Education and Assistance Corporation, opens on Thursday and runs through June 18 in the parking lot of Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Uniondale (516) 794-9300.</p>
        <p>On a smaller, more intimate scale, Freeport stages a Summer Festival Saturday and next Sunday along Woodcleft Avenue, with crafts, a carnival, rides, petting zoo, entertainment and, from noon to 5 p.m. each day, demonstrations of maritime folk arts via Long Island Traditions (516) 378-7323. In Long Beach, the emphasis will be on the past, as the Long Beach Historical Society holds its annual ''Heritage Weekend'' Saturday and next Sunday, with tours of historic homes and an exhibition of paintings inspired by local architecture by Jacqueline Joy Sferra. The museum is on West Penn Street (516) 432-1192. In Setauket, the Three Village Historical Society holds its Country Fair, with a ''Punch and Judy Show,'' petting zoo and square dances, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday. There is also an auction at 11 a.m. with a preview from 9 to 11 a.m. This all takes place at the society on North Country Road (631) 751-3730.</p>
        <p>Then, there are the ethnic events: the Greek Village Festival Friday through next Sunday at the Greek Orthodox Church of the Resurrection on Cedar Swamp Road in Glen Cove (516) 671-5200, and the Long Island Bavarian Heritage Festival on Saturday and next Sunday at Plattdeutsche Park on Hempstead Turnpike in Franklin Square (516) 354-3131. Finally, if spring has finally sprung, can strawberries be far away? Apparently not. All Saint's Episcopal Church, on Middle Neck Road in Great Neck, holds its 84th Annual Strawberry Festival from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Friday and Saturday (516) 482-5392.</p>
        <p>Garden Tours</p>
        <p>Garden fans on both ends of the Island can see what other green thumbs have produced in two different tours on Saturday. Out east, in Cutchogue, starting at 10 a.m. on the Village Green with a lecture by Suzy Bales, a writer, seven gardens in a variety of styles, will be opened to the curious. The tour ends at 4 p.m. at Laurel Lake Vineyards with a wine-tasting reception (631) 734-2335. ''The Secret Gardens of Sea Cliff'' figure in the Sea Cliff Beautification Committee's tour of 10 private gardens in the area; 7 of which have never before been made public. The walking tour of sites, which range from a two-acre property with a woodland walk, formal garden and fish pond to a 60-foot by 40-foot garden created only last year, is from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. and includes ''Art for the Garden,'' a show of ornaments, planters and furniture, and a garden tea party with musical entertainment (516) 759-5812.</p>
        <p>Free Choices</p>
        <p>TODAY -- Paddy Doyle's Boots, a traditional music ensemble, opens the Islip Arts Council weekly ''Summer 2000 Concert Series'' at 2 p.m. at Bayard Cutting Arboretum in Oakdale. While the music is free, there is a $5 parking fee (631) 224-5420.</p>
        <p>Another outdoor concert series, at the Sousa Band Shell in Port Washington, begins as well with the Schreiber High School Band doing the opening-day honors at 3 p.m. The series continues at 8:15 p.m. Friday with the Pilsner Brass Band (516) 739-2345.</p>
        <p>THURSDAY -- Hicks Nurseries, on Jericho Turnpike in Westbury, begins four Herb Days with such sessions as ''Basic Do's and Don'ts of Growing Herbs,'' at 11 a.m. and 2 p.m., and ''Lucious Lemony Herbs,'' at 7 p.m. among the programs on Friday is ''The Facial Garden,'' 4 p.m.; Saturday brings ''Creating an Herbal Lawn,'' 3 p.m., and next Sunday the courses include ''Native Herbs'' at 11 a.m. (516) 334-0066.</p>
        <p>SATURDAY -- The North Shore Symphony Orchestra, with Janice Martin, violinist, performs works by Vaughan Williams, Villa-Lobos, Grieg and Lalo at 8 p.m. at North Shore High School on Glen Cove Avenue in Glen Head (516) 705-0358.</p>
