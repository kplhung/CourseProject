        <p>TRAVEL writing seems to exist in a permanent state of near extinction. People who ponder the health of literary genres have assumed that in a world where anybody with enough money can launch an assault on Everest and intrepid octogenarians routinely hobble around the Galpagos, few would settle for merely reading about the experience. These days, many of our most popular travel books -- Frances Mayess paeans to Tuscany come to mind -- are not really travel books but lavish fantasias of home renovation, which only serve to confirm the fact that anyone with two weeks vacation and a credit card can join an eco-tour of the Costa Rican rain forest but a good team of construction workers, whether at home or abroad, is almost impossible to find.</p>
        <p>And yet real travel writing is far from being over. It should come as no surprise that its practitioners, who pride themselves on doing things other people wont and dont, are a plucky breed, with a capacity for self-invention that makes Madonna look stuck in a rut. Just a little more than 20 years ago (then as now, travel writing was thought to be in extremis), Bruce Chatwin published the genre-bending classic ''In Patagonia, which spawned a generation of travel writers whose M.O. consisted of going somewhere unexpected and simply wandering around, relying on their own eclectic interests and captivating personalities to float the narrative boat. We are now in the midst of a backlash. The ends of the earth have come to seem as exotic as the end of the block (consider this: the ladies of Weno, the seven-square-mile island capital of Chuuk, in Micronesia, are devotees of Victorias Secret), and our popular tastes have been dulled by a need for simplistic plots. We now require a gimmick, an angle, a concept -- the exact things an adventure in the Chatwinesque mode was guaranteed not to have. Travel writing, like the novel, has gone Hollywood.</p>

        <p>One ridiculous and sublime example of the high-concept travel book is the British comedian Tony Hawkss ROUND IRELAND WITH A FRIDGE (Thomas Dunne/St. Martins, $23.95). After a night of enthusiastic drinking, a friend bets the author</p>
