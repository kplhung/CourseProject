        <p>In a last-ditch effort to woo minority voters, Jon S. Corzine stumped tirelessly today in black neighborhoods from Montclair to Trenton. He shook hands, kissed babies, and then pulled out what might be his best campaign weapon: a glossy attack ad that links him to slavery in Africa.</p>
        <p>The four-page color brochure, Mr. Corzine said, was mailed to minority voters this week by supporters of former Gov. Jim Florio, his rival for the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate.</p>
        <p>''This is the lowest form of divisiveness,'' Mr. Corzine said. ''I think it gives no respect to the people who receive it -- who I think are smart enough to see it for what it is.''</p>
        <p>As Mr. Corzine passed the ad around, several black voters shook their heads angrily. ''It's insulting because they're trying to appeal to a stereotype that we're led by our emotions,'' said Gayle Chaneyfield-Jenkins, 41, a city councilwoman in Newark. ''It's not true. The African-American community is well versed on issues.''</p>
        <p>The ad shows two African children clad in dirty rags along with the message: ''Tell Jon Corzine not to profit from slavery in Africa!'' It asserts that Mr. Corzine, a former chairman of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, participated in a business deal that helped Sudan's Islamic regime finance a brutal civil and religious war in which some Christian rebels were forced into slavery.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine has repeatedly denied any direct involvement in Sudanese affairs. In 1995, Goldman Sachs issued $200 million in bonds for a Canadian oil company involved in a Sudanese pipeline project.</p>
        <p>The issue has led to a debate among business ethics experts about whether it is fair to hold executives accountable for the ramifications of deals when they were not active participants.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Florio has raised the Sudanese issue before, his campaign today denied any involvement with the ad. Walter Fields, a senior adviser to Mr. Florio, said the campaign learned about the ad only after it was mailed out by the Camden County Democratic committee. ''This is entirely one of their products,'' he said. ''But the issue is, we believe, legitimate. It sounds to me like Jon Corzine has a guilty conscience.''</p>
        <p>A phone call to the Democratic committee seeking comment was not returned. The committee has endorsed Mr. Florio and shares its office in Cherry Hill with his campaign staff, but Mr. Fields said the two organizations were separate.</p>
        <p>In an increasingly nasty campaign, Mr. Corzine and Mr. Florio have leveled inflammatory charges against each other in a barrage of ads, faxes and direct mailings. Mr. Corzine has spent $35 million on the primary, mostly for ads attacking Mr. Florio's record as governor. Earlier this week, Mr. Corzine admitted paying $200,000 to a lawyer who hired private investigators to check on Mr. Florio and his staff.</p>
        <p>Mr. Florio's campaign has struck back with a series of news conferences, faxes and ads that accuse Mr. Corzine of everything from raiding employees' pension funds to what it says are the consequences of the Sudanese pipeline deal.</p>
        <p>In an effort to use the latest attack ad to his advantage, Mr. Corzine promised minority voters today that he would stick to the issues that mattered to them. While he acknowledged that the ad might cause some confusion, he said he believed that most voters would recognize it as a campaign trick.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Corzine left a crowded lawn party in downtown Newark, several black residents said the ad made them even more determined to vote for Mr. Corzine in Tuesday's primary.</p>
        <p>''It's not going to work, it's going to backfire,'' said one of them, Tony Wright. ''We already see through it.''</p>
