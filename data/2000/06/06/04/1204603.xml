        <p>ON a recent Tuesday evening at Yonkers Raceway, Lindy Belles, a tiny man in his 60's with a rosy wizened face, nursed a beer and reminisced about his first visit here, 40 years ago.</p>
        <p>''There were so many people here -- 27,000 on a weeknight,'' he said. ''There were traffic jams on the way to the track. There were picnic tables here, everyone betting. It was such a big, great thing. How can I pronounce it? And now it's just -- diminished.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Belles gazed out at the second-floor clubhouse, where old men shuffled across the maroon carpet amid the smell of stale coffee and beer. The track's management claims an average attendance of 1,000, but on this night there cannot be more than a couple of hundred people here, none of whom appear to be under 45.</p>
        <p>Through the clubhouse's vast plexiglass windows the horses can be seen racing along the track's oval of light. But scarcely anyone is watching. Instead, they stare at the screens at their tables, where they can see the race without straining their eyes, or catch other races being simulcast from tracks upstate. Outside in the darkness, only a handful of figures in windbreakers stand watching by the rail.</p>
        <p>A year after celebrating its centennial, Yonkers Raceway is dying. What was once New York's greatest gambling venue has lost out to TV, casinos, and harness racing's failure to attract a new generation of fans.</p>
        <p>''Our time at Yonkers has come to an end,'' Tim Rooney, the racetrack's owner, said in an interview in his office at the track. ''You can't have a 100-acre facility and just use a fraction of the property.'' After losing roughly $5 million for three years running, the track broke even in 1999, but the property is for sale, and the track will likely be gone in a year or two.</p>
        <p>The only way to revive the track, said Mr. Rooney, would be to introduce slot machines, which have brought new life to a number of dying harness tracks in other states. Although casino gambling is illegal in New York State, slot machines -- or a near variant known as Video Lottery Terminals -- could become legal at Yonkers if a current effort to introduce casino gambling in the Catskills is successful.</p>
        <p>However, that is viewed as a long shot, and is not likely to delay the track's sale, which could happen as early as this summer, said Joe Morningstar, the managing director of Rockwood Realty, the principal marketer of the property.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the track is slowly being dismantled.</p>
        <p>Once Yonkers' second-largest employer and taxpayer, with more than 2,500 employees (not including horsemen and trainers), the track now employs 500 people. The third and fourth floors of the clubhouse are closed, their orange and green seats empty, the betting windows quiet as a fun house in winter. The third floor, once the biggest dance floor in Westchester County, is scarcely ever used. The track's grandstand, which once held 15,000 people, was torn down five years ago, leaving several acres of scarred concrete next to the clubhouse.</p>
        <p>For 20 years, as attendance has waned, the track has been host to the Westchester County Fair, which is going on now through June 11. It is also host to bimonthly boxing matches.</p>
        <p>Surprisingly, Yonkers may still have nearly as many fans as it did a decade or two ago. But instead of going to the track, they watch the races in OTB parlors or on TV, placing bets by phone. This is the twilight condition of harness racing throughout the country, said Stan Bergstein, executive vice president of Harness Tracks of America: off-track and inter-track betting is flourishing, while many tracks languish.</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. Rooney said Yonkers Raceway would have closed long ago if it had not become a vast OTB parlor in its own right, simulcasting thoroughbred races in the afternoon to bettors who might just as easily watch them in the city. The track makes money this way, but not enough to offset the long-term drop in attendance.</p>
        <p>The track's demise would end a long and largely forgotten chapter of New York's history. Harness racing, in which the driver rides behind the horse in a cart, or sulky, and the horse must never break out of a trotting gait, evolved out of carriage races at rural county fairs. But the cumbersome sulkies made it difficult to determine a precise start to the race, deterring bettors. That changed in the late 1940's with the introduction of the mobile starting gate, a car with a gate spread out behind it.</p>
        <p>The sport became more competitive at the same time, thanks to a young driver named Stanley Dancer who shocked harness fans by driving his horse aggressively right out of the starting gate.</p>
        <p>Starting in 1950, Yonkers and Roosevelt Raceway, on Long Island, became the only real gambling spots available to New Yorkers. When the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants left town in the late 50's, the two tracks picked up the slack. Every major newspaper covered the sport.</p>
        <p>''They brought in the Bronx middle-class Irish, Jews, Italians,'' recalled Joe Goldstein, the legendary public relations man who worked alternately for both tracks from 1952 through 1968. ''Westchester was just starting its postwar explosion. The baby boomer parents came back and got into horses.''</p>
        <p>Most of the men who came here during its heyday remember Yonkers as a loud, boisterous place, in keeping with trotting's blue-collar reputation, compared with the aristocratic thoroughbreds.</p>
        <p>''There was always a fog of smoke,'' recalled Michael Katz, who was a regular at Yonkers 30 years ago. ''I couldn't even think about a trotting race without having cheap cigar smoke in my nostrils.'' Sometimes when a heavy favorite lost, the angry crowd would riot, surging past the rail or even tearing down the tote board.</p>
        <p>The sport also had an aroma of crookedness, thanks in part to the Moreland Commission hearings of 1954, which unveiled a ring of corrupt politicians who had been skimming money from several New York trotting tracks. And in later years higher-stakes bets, like the twin double, the exacta and the trifecta, created more opportunities for drivers to fix races. ''That led to shenanigans,'' said Ray Brienza, who has been writing about harness racing since 1956. ''The greater the reward, the more enticing for dishonest horsemen.''</p>
        <p>But in the late 1950's and 60's there were few scandals, and the track drew the rich and famous as well as the rowdies. Jackie Robinson, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Cab Calloway, Arnold Palmer and Whitey Ford were regulars. The track's most popular drivers, Stanley Dancer and William Haughtan, known as the Gold Dust Twins, became celebrities. Ed Sullivan, a regular at the track, brought Mr. Dancer on his show several times, once with his winning horse, Cardigan Bay.</p>
        <p>''This was the only game in town,'' recalled Mike Sorrentino, a construction executive and horse owner who has been coming here since 1957. ''And it was a night out -- a beautiful night out.''</p>
        <p>At its height in the 1950's and 60's, the track drew up to 40,000 people on weekends, and 25,000 on weeknights. ''It could take an hour just to get out of the parking lot,'' said Morton Finder, a racing industry consultant who bet here most nights from 1957 through the early 1980's. A whole cottage industry of off-site parking arose to meet the need.</p>
        <p>The decline started in 1971, with the advent of Off Track Betting. Suddenly bettors could get their fix without going to the track. Mr. Dancer recalled getting into a cab a year or two later and having the star-struck cabbie tell him that he was his biggest fan, that he had never missed a night at Yonkers. Mr. Dancer asked if he still went, and the cabbie went silent. ''I've got to pay the bills, I can't make it out there,'' he said. ''I bet at OTB.''</p>
        <p>In theory, OTB might have helped by drawing in bettors who would not ordinarily have come to the track. In practice, the 2.5 percent the track earned from bets placed at OTB parlors wasn't enough to offset the loss in attendance. In other states, tracks were investors in OTB and earned a larger share of its revenue, about 10 percent, said John Pawlak, a spokesman for the United States Trotting Association. But in New York, OTB was a government agency, and it became the track's competitor.</p>
        <p>And Yonkers got a more direct competitor when the Meadowlands opened in 1976, with a larger track and newer facilities.</p>
        <p>In 1974 the track's average daily ''live'' handle, or money bet on the premises, was over $2 million. By 1977 it was down to less than $1.3 million. Today it is $160,000.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rooney, who has been a harness racing fan since he was in college, tried to promote Yonkers. ''We had Fan Appreciation Days,'' Mr. Rooney said with a melancholy smile. ''Free parking and admissions. The first time we did it, we had 28,000 people. The last time, it didn't make any difference. We gave away watches one year. We had 19,000 people. Last time, it was the same as any other day. We tried T-shirts. The first time it was great; last time we ended up with closetsful of T-shirts. It's a very difficult sell these days, harness racing.''</p>
        <p>Once a proud rival to thoroughbred racing, harness is now only a third as large, Mr. Pawlak of the United States Trotting Association said. The total bet on harness races has remained roughly the same since 1980, despite off-track betting. ''Racing in general has not turned over its fan base,'' said Frank Drucker, a spokesman for Yonkers. ''The new generation of bettors think racing is just too complicated.''</p>
        <p>In 1986, harness tracks joined in OTB's game, sending and receiving simulcasts of other harness races at night and receiving thoroughbred races in the afternoon. In other words, you could bet on Yonkers races while sitting at other tracks, or in a casino in Las Vegas or Atlantic City. Or you could bet on thoroughbred races at Yonkers in the afternoon, when the track is empty. Starting in the mid-90's you could even watch Yonkers on cable TV, via the Racing Channel, and place bets through OTB or a bookie.</p>
        <p>These off-track alternatives now constitute 85 percent of harness tracks' earnings, said Stan Bergstein, executive vice president of Harness Tracks of America. They have allowed many tracks to flourish even when their grandstands are empty. The Meadowlands, for instance, has been paying record winnings to its horsemen even as its live attendance has declined.</p>
        <p>But Yonkers has had less success attracting bettors as its reputation and the quality of its horses waned. ''In many respects it was hard for horsemen to dissociate Yonkers from Roosevelt,'' said Steven Katz, executive vice president of Walnut Hall Limited, a breeding farm for standardbred horses in Lexington, Ky. ''Everybody's sort of been waiting for Yonkers to die.'' Roosevelt Raceway closed in 1988.</p>
        <p>That resigned attitude is palpable at the Yonkers paddock, a low-slung building across the track from the clubhouse, where horsemen lead their mounts back and forth amid a cool smell of manure and stone dust.</p>
        <p>''When I first came here, this was the place, the cream of the crop, the best horses, the best drivers,'' said John Marsh, a lanky 40-year-old driver and trainer. Since then the purses -- or prize money for winning horses -- has dropped sharply, and so has the quality of the horses. Mr. Marsh still makes between $50,000 and $100,000 a year, he added, which is better than average. But he is leaving racing, and he wouldn't advise a young man to go into it.</p>
        <p>In a sense, the horsemen are becoming irrelevant as tracks struggle to compete with casinos for gambling dollars. Casinos, after all, don't have to pay out half their winnings to the horse owners, trainers and drivers. This allows them to steal the tracks' biggest bettors by giving them rebates, even as they offer them the simulcast of the tracks' races to bet on. Cash rebates are illegal in Nevada and most other states, but casinos manage to find other ways to compensate their big bettors, said Joe Lynch, chief of racing operations at the New York State Racing and Wagering Board.</p>
        <p>''We had one guy, our biggest customer, he bet $10 million a year,'' Mr. Rooney said. ''Then he went to Suffolk OTB -- they built him his own room, concession stand, TV. Now he's moved out to Las Vegas, and, of course, they're doing more for him.''</p>
        <p>The one hope for survival is to catch up with the competition by bringing casino gambling to the racetrack. That, at any rate, is what every harness driver, trainer and fan will tell you. And it is true that slot machines have revitalized tracks where they have been introduced. The most popular example is Dover Downs, a small racetrack in Dover, Del. Five years ago, Dover's daily purses were about $7,500 a day -- ''near the bottom of the ladder,'' Timothy Horne, the track's chief financial officer, said. After the track introduced slot machines following their legalization in Delaware in 1994, purses shot up, and they now average $130,000 a day -- second only to the Meadowlands.</p>
        <p>That increase doesn't reflect growth in the amount that is bet on the track, Mr. Horne said. The growth comes from the slot revenue, which allows the track to attract better horses by offering larger purses, which in turn allows it to simulcast its signal and earn money from off track betting.</p>
        <p>Yonkers was hoping to do the same thing in 1997, when the State Legislature voted on a constitutional amendment to allow gambling. The measure passed in the Assembly, but failed in the Senate after intense lobbying by opponents, including environmentalists, the religious right and Donald Trump, who paid $855,750 to a team of lobbyists and whose Atlantic City casinos would have been threatened by casinos in New York.</p>
        <p>Soon after that vote, Mr. Rooney put a ''For Sale'' sign up outside the raceway.</p>
        <p>Recently, however, hope has risen anew for slot machines at Yonkers, thanks to the Interior Department's approval in April of an Indian casino in the Catskills.</p>
        <p>If such a casino were to be built -- which is far from certain, in light of the current disputes over its development -- it would create political pressure to allow some form of slot machines at New York State racetracks, said State Senator Nicholas A. Spano, who represents Yonkers.</p>
        <p>''With slots, Yonkers would become a gold mine,'' said Mike Sorrentino, the horse owner. ''We have more access to people than any other race track in the world. They'd come to play the machines, not to bet on horses. But the horsemen would share in that revenue.''</p>
        <p>Next Incarnation: A Stadium or a Mall?</p>
        <p>SINCE it was first listed for sale more than two years ago, Yonkers Raceway has been rumored as a possible stadium site for the Jets and the Yankees, a hotel, a mall, a housing complex and a film studio. ''It's by far the largest, most accessible development site on the fringes of New York City,'' William Cuddy Jr., a senior manager at Insignia ESG, a real estate brokerage, said of the 97.5-acre site just off the Major Deegan Expressway.</p>
        <p>But it has still not been sold.</p>
        <p>Robert Galterio, the track's general manager, would not comment beyond saying that the sale was a complex transaction and that there had been concerns about how potential buyers would use the land. The track's owner, Tim Rooney, ''is very concerned that what happens here is good for the city and the county,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Any buyer would need the city's approval for potential uses and would likely face a rezoning and review process. The property is zoned for industrial use.</p>
        <p>And the city has strong views about what should be built.</p>
        <p>''What we do not want is a big megamall,'' Phil Amicone, the deputy mayor of Yonkers, said. ''We want something that's a part of the community, not something that's an island unto itself.''</p>
        <p>Joe Morningstar, managing director for Rockwood Realty of New York, said, ''We have had negotiations with probably every major developer in the country.''</p>
        <p>Rockwood Realty is marketing the property in conjunction with McCarthy O'Callaghan, a White Plains concern.</p>
        <p>An initial round of bids in early 1998 led to a contract with Tishman Speyer, which owns the Chrysler Building and other major sites. The proposal was for a mixed-use retail and residential development. But Tishman Speyer withdrew in mid-1999. ''Price and other considerations were involved,'' Mr. Morningstar said. Offers have been in the range of $100 million, he added. Spokesmen for Tishman Speyer declined to comment on why the deal fell through, as did Mr. Rooney.</p>
        <p>The track is now looking at three potential buyers, with one contract under active consideration, Mr. Morningstar said.</p>
        <p>The value of the site depends on what uses are approved, said Louis R. Capelli of Capelli Development, which built New Roc City in New Rochelle.</p>
