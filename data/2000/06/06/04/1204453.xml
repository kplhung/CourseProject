        <p>Reading the latest works of these two very different poets is like visiting with two beloved but very different relatives. There's the wise old aunt (Nikki Grimes), who pulls you on her lap and spins colorful, instructional yarns of her travels. You either love them and beg for more, or you wiggle out of her lap and run over to your uncle (William Jay Smith), who throws you up in the air and makes you giggle at nonsense.</p>
        <p>Which one do you want at the family reunion? Both, definitely. Each poet speaks to a different kind of child, or perhaps a child in a particular mood.</p>
        <p>Smith's collection is for children who are in the mood for silliness. While there is plenty of strong new material, many of the 29 poems previously appeared in his ''Laughing Time: Nonsense Poems'' (1955). ''Around My Room'' successfully reaches out to a younger audience. Erik Blegvad's illustrations nicely ground the verbal shenanigans with his crisp, consistently lovely, whimsical watercolors. He respects the literal shapes of Smith's poems, wrapping his pictures around the text while leaving plenty of white space. Blegvad's art never overpowers the poems, but some of them cry out for a bit more levity, as in, say, ''The Fat-Cat Circus'':</p>
        <p>And Cat Lion-tamers</p>
        <p>have Cats at their knees.</p>
        <p>There are Cats on bicycles</p>
        <p>and Cats on white ponies,</p>
        <p>Cat-magicians, Cat-jugglers,</p>
        <p>Tomcats, Siamese.</p>
        <p>This scene should be a feast of irony, and yet it is played so straight that it manages to look perfectly natural to see cats on horses, and a cat wielding a top hat and whip. The visual humor -- for a younger audience especially -- is occasionally too subtle.</p>
        <p>For the most part, though, Blegvad and Smith are a delightful pairing. Smith's talent endures, as seen in the seamless blend of old and new offerings. Reading the old poem ''The Toaster,'' we again revel in the fantasy of having one's own personal dragon:</p>
        <p>A silver-scaled Dragon with jaws flaming red</p>
        <p>Sits at my elbow and toasts my bread.</p>
        <p>I hand him fat slices, and then, one by one,</p>
        <p>He hands them back when he sees they are done.</p>
        <p>A newer selection, ''The Kid From Nebraska,'' is a series of limericks in which Smith's intelligent silliness shines through:</p>
        <p>An eccentric explorer named Hayter</p>
        <p>Sat down on an alligator;</p>
        <p>In the swamp in the fog</p>
        <p>It resembled a log.</p>
        <p>Exploration thus ended for Hayter.</p>
        <p>Nikki Grimes's work typically burrows into deeper life issues. In the recent ''Jazmin's Notebook'' (a Coretta Scott King honor book), she explores the journal of a 14-year-old girl in Harlem: a dead father, a distant mother, an attempted rape are all part of her world. Grimes's long career in prose and poetry exhibits a breathtaking range in tone and style, but generally focuses on urban African-American environments. In ''Is It Far to Zanzibar?'' she ventures off the familiar urban stage into the exotic world of Tanzania. The first poem, ''Down the Road a Bit,'' wryly dramatizes how she, as poet, is luring us, the readers, to open our eyes to a new culture:</p>
        <p>Walk down the road a bit, cousin.</p>
        <p>Walk down the road a bit.</p>
        <p>The place you're seeking, I will help you to find.</p>
        <p>This invitation to meet our Tanzanian cousins is underscored by a man in a Western-style suit, carrying a suitcase, walking past pawpaw groves and shirtless old men carving masks and giraffes. Like this wide-eyed traveler, we begin to grasp that we aren't in Kansas (or Harlem) anymore.</p>
        <p>The tone is as light and refreshing as the luscious fruit Grimes describes in ''Many Mangoes'': ''Ripe and sweet, juicy meat. / A few shillings only for a tasty treat.'' There are no deep issues here, just the pleasure and enlightenment of stepping into another life for a while. Grimes does not use Tanzania as a mere backdrop for storytelling; the land's geography and culture give breath to every line. Swahili words are sprinkled throughout; a glossary and map are included.</p>
        <p>The poems deal with such exotic experiences as picking coffee, being chased up a tree by a lion, and sharing a bus with ''squawking chickens near my seat, / billy goats sniff at my feet.'' But Grimes also wisely bridges the cultural gap with ''Haraka, Haraka'' (''Hurry, Hurry''), which shows how, in some ways, Tanzanian children are not so very different from their Western cousins:</p>
        <p>Haraka! Hurry! Right this minute.</p>
        <p>Aina baraka. There's no blessing in it.</p>
        <p>The elders tell me this each day,</p>
        <p>But I haraka anyway!</p>
        <p>I eat my porridge while it's too hot.</p>
        <p>I scream and burn my tongue a lot!</p>
        <p>I rush to fill the water pail,</p>
        <p>Then spill the water without fail!</p>
        <p>Betsy Lewin's illustrations follow Grimes's lighthearted lead with watercolors in a cartoonish, exuberant fashion. Like Grimes, Lewin has traveled to East Africa, and blends her firsthand knowledge of that land with vivid color and playful renderings.</p>
        <p>''Around My Room'' may have an edge in the rollicking good fun department, but ''Is It Far to Zanzibar?'' offers a lively, albeit quieter, peek at the great big world that lies beyond one's bedroom.</p>
