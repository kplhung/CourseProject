        <p>FROM opposite ends of the dance universe come two superstars: Mikhail Baryshnikov and Yvonne Rainer. He from the purest centuries-old classical tradition, she from the rule-breaking Judson Dance Theater of the 1960's. He the prince of Russian ballet; she the high priestess of the American avant-garde. He known for his natural theatricality, she for her resistance to anything theatrical.</p>
        <p>They are rehearsing together for a season of the White Oak Dance Project, of which Mr. Baryshnikov is founder and director as well as lead performer, at the Brooklyn Academy of Music from June 7 to 11. In addition to a new work by Ms. Rainer, there will be premieres by Mark Morris and John Jasperse and Trisha Brown's ''Glacial Decoy'' (1979). How did it happen that Baryshnikov asked Rainer, who had not choreographed a dance in decades, to contribute to this program?</p>
        <p>In the last 25 years Mr. Baryshnikov has journeyed deep into the repertory of American modern dance, while Ms. Rainer, in the last year, has returned to the dance studio after 25 years as a noted feminist filmmaker. Since its inception in 1990, White Oak has commissioned 40 new dances from modern choreographers, starting with its initial resident choreographer, Mark Morris, and on through Lar Lubovitch, Maurice Bejart, Kevin O'Day, Neil Greenberg and Lucy Guerin. Last fall Mr. Baryshnikov, 52, came to Judson Memorial Church in Greenwich Village when Ms. Rainer, 65, danced in a new version of her seminal ''Trio A'' (1966), a five-minute continuous phrase in which the dancers never look out at the audience. Planning a program for this fall featuring choreographers from Judson Dance Theater, legendary as the incubator of postmodern dance, Mr. Baryshnikov invited Ms. Rainer to choreograph something.</p>
        <p>''When I came to see White Oak and met him, I was surprised and pleased that he was familiar with the titles and the personnel of my past work,'' Ms. Rainer said recently during a rehearsal at the Trisha Brown Studio near Columbus Circle in Manhattan. ''He'd done his homework. I said I could give him 'Trio A' and 'We shall Run' (1963). Then he said, 'Maybe you'd like to do a new piece.' I gulped. And then it began to obsess me. What would I do?'' Separated by a quarter-century from her work in dance, she went home and riffled through her book ''Work: 1961-1973'' to gather bits and pieces from her past artistic life that could be rearranged. Harking back to the Dadaist method of fragmentation, Ms. Rainer chose a collage structure to contain the selections. Like much of her work in both dance and film, the ideas and images are presented not in a beginning-middle-and-end format, but in a series of radical juxtapositions of tasks, interactions and spoken texts.</p>
        <p>Ingredients for this collage, titled ''After Many a Summer Dies the Swan,'' are drawn from ''Three Satie Spoons'' (1960), ''The Bells'' (1961), ''The Mind Is a Muscle'' (1968) and ''Continuous Project -- Altered Daily'' (1970). Actions may be simultaneous, deflecting attention from one another, or sequential. One section, in which dancers cushion one another's movements with pillows, has a goofy precision. In another, two women link arms around each other's waists as they repeatedly melt to the floor and rise, still attached. They are reciting, in falsetto, a Gertrude Stein-ish bit of text by Rainer: ''That was so lovely.''  ''Yes yes that was so lovely.''  ''It was so lovely it will make me think about it a lot.''  ''In fact we will write about all that thinking,'' and so on. Rainer advises audience members: ''You kind of roll with the different elements that keep coming to the surface and disappearing.''</p>
        <p>Seeing Ms. Rainer and Mr. Baryshnikov in a studio together makes perfect sense. Both have short spiky hair, long torsos and arms, boyish bodies. When they kissed each other hello they seemed to be exactly the same height, and their rehearsal demeanor has a similar balance of readiness and calm. They understand each other's physicality, and more, they seem to understand each other's state of mind. Ms. Rainer said, ''He has this restless intellect that's led him into this 60's corner of dancing.'' He affectionately called her a ''professional revolutionary,'' and added, ''It's fun to see such passion in her.''</p>
        <p>While rehearsing the group sections, the six White Oak dancers -- besides Mr. Baryshnikov, they are Raquel Aedo, Emily Coates, Roselynde LeBlanc, Michael Lomeka and Emmanuele Phuon -- have vivid personalities and dance technique to burn, but Mr. Baryshnikov shows slightly more relish for the movement than the younger performers do. A high point of the piece is sure to be ''Valda's Solo,'' originally from Ms. Rainer's first film, ''Lives of Performers'' (1972). Here, it reveals Mr. Baryshnikov in a different mood.  He wears a velvet gown, and lets a red ball roll off his hand and drop to the floor. Not much happens, but it's riveting. While the dancer and actor Valda Setterfield looked elegant and aristocratic in the film, Mr. Baryshnikov looks lonely and pensive, creating an aura of melancholy.</p>
        <p>Far in the pasts of both Ms. Rainer and Mr. Baryshnikov are precursors to this collaboration. Mr. Baryshnikov started dancing with modern dance choreographers soon after he defected from the Soviet Union in 1974, including Twyla Tharp, Alvin Ailey, Martha Graham, Paul Taylor, Erick Hawkins and Merce Cunningham. Even earlier, during his last year in St. Petersburg, he presented a program in which he chose and danced in works by experimental choreographers, including Mai Murdmaa from Estonia. She had him rolling on the floor -- quite simple and grounded compared to what his audience expected of him. The photographer and ballet critic Nina Alovert recently said: ''From the beginning, he wanted to do contemporary dance. He tried to do every way of ballet which we've had in Russia. In 1971 he danced in 'Creation of the World' by Natalia Kasatkina. It was everything not classical. It combined knees turned in and knees turned out. He danced it like a god.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Rainer remembers seeing Alicia Markova dance ''Giselle'' in the late 1950's. ''She was the only dancer I have ever waited for at the stage door,'' Ms. Rainer said. ''I was totally transported.'' Much later, one of the many bits in ''The Mind Is a Muscle'' was something she called the ''Nijinsky pose.'' In the new piece, she extends the cushion section with a kind of classical pas de deux with Ms. Coates, the most obviously balletic of the White Oak women, partnered by Mr. Baryshnikov with pillows. She is using their virtuosity as a ''found object,'' in almost the same way visual artists like Robert Rauschenberg did in the 60's.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baryshnikov traces his interest in Judson Dance Theater back to David Gordon, whom he invited to choreograph for American Ballet Theater when he was its artistic director. Mr. Gordon created ''Field, Chair and Mountain'' (1986), in which Martine van Hamel was promenaded on point on top of a metal folding chair. Mr. Gordon said of Baryshnikov's being drawn to this experimental work: ''His attraction is to dance with integrity. He's willing to back up his own taste and intuitions. He refuses to stay in the past. He takes other people's past and tries it on; he's an inquisitive guy.'' The choregrapher Trisha Brown has called Baryshnikov ''a questing spirit.''</p>
        <p>His quest, at this point, is partly a search for what sits comfortably in the mind as well as on the body of a no-longer-young dancer who wants to keep dancing. Two years ago, Mr. Baryshnikov told Laura Shapiro of Newsweek: ''I've gotten into minimalism in my dancing. In the first part of life you accumulate experience, and then at the end you try to get rid of what's not necessary.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Rainer started getting rid of the extras early on. In fact, it was her modus operandi as a dance minimalist. After working on ''Parts of Some Sextets,'' she wrote the now-famous manifesto, ''NO to spectacle no to virtuosity no to transformations and magic and make-believe no to the glamour and transcendency of the star image no to the heroic . . .,'' first published in 1965 in The Drama Review. But in the new piece, she uses not only Mr. Baryshnikov's heroic image, but also a new text about transformation -- an essay by Vladimir Nabokov about a caterpillar turning into a butterfly.</p>
        <p>In defense of her manifesto, Ms. Rainer now says, ''One of the functions of a manifesto is to clear the air, to start over or re-examine expectations.'' Here, Ms. Rainer and Mr. Baryshnikov join together in the postmodern project of re-examining, reconstructing, reanalyzing and representing. He is re-examining his role(s) in the dance world and she is reconstructing and rearranging her works from the past. For Ms. Rainer, the challenge is to bring her quotidian, tasklike dances onto a proscenium stage.</p>
        <p>ONE of her few forays into such a situation was at the Billy Rose Theater on Broadway in 1969, when the producer Charles Reinhardt invited several young, unorthodox choreographers to perform, including Twyla Tharp, Meredith Monk and Ms. Rainer. Pat Catterson, new in New York at the time, remembers the effect that Ms. Rainer's ''Rose Fractions'' had on her: ''I'd never seen anything like it. It was in that anything-can-follow-anything mode. In one part, Yvonne did Lenny Bruce's monologue on snot. In another part, dancers and nondancers were doing 'Trio A.' It was unpretentious, accessible, egalitarian and totally of the moment. They ended by doing it to the Chambers Brothers'  'In the Midnight Hour,' and the audience was on its feet hooting and howling. We all felt like we wanted to do that. After it was over, some audience members went right up on the stage and did it. When I got home, I did all the moves I could remember from it.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Rainer is enjoying her return to the dance world: ''I love working with dancers. I've never been entirely comfortable as a filmmaker because I never shot my own film. I'm a techno-idiot, so much of it is out of my control. Here I feel like I'm back where I belong. It's like coming home, at least temporarily.'' She has the utmost regard for Mr. Baryshnikov's choice to delve into dances of the rebellious 60's. ''It's unprecedented for a classical dancer to do this,'' she said. ''And he's pulling in an audience that, in many cases, is unfamiliar with that history. So in that sense he is a revitalizing force in the dance world.''</p>
        <p>Last month while on tour, after two standing-room-only performances by White Oak in Clearwater, Fla., Ms. Rainer faxed this report: ''The first night we softened them up. Misha introduced me and I basically told them not to worry. They laughed at everything. The second night: no introduction, much more subdued response during the piece, but at the end, a combination of standing ovation and boos.''</p>
