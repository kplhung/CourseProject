        <p>Reinforcements are coming to the aid of Representative George Nethercutt, Republican of Washington.</p>
        <p>For the last year, since Mr. Nethercutt broke his pledge to serve only six years in the House, he has been the target of a relentless advertising assault by U.S. Term Limits. The advocacy group's no-punches-pulled message: George Nethercutt is a liar.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nethercutt has fought back with his own advertising campaign, upping the verbiage ante by calling officials of U.S. Term Limits felons. But the Washington State Republican Committee, seeing the need for even stronger measures, has just opened a $100,000 advertising blitz that it hopes will ensure the Spokane-area seat does not fall into Democratic hands. The committee's message, delivered in a commercial  drawn up by the National Republican Campaign Committee: U.S. Term Limits is engaged in ''mudslinging paid for by secret donors.''</p>
        <p>At this point, the betting is that Mr. Nethercutt will probably be able to hang on. Still, few House races in the country are more bitterly contested than this one. But then, few have the love-gone-sour aspect this one has.</p>
        <p>Back in 1994, U.S. Term Limits made Mr. Nethercutt its poster boy when his pledge to serve only three terms on Capitol Hill helped him unseat Speaker Tom Foley, a 15-term Democrat.</p>
