        <p>Kathy Harsany Crusoe letter notes juxtaposition of May 7 articles on pressure to sell building that houses area's only technical high school to Stamford, Conn, and elaborate wine cellars being built in local homes (S)</p>

        <p>It was cruel irony to have placed the article about the pressure to cede the building that houses the area's only technical high school to the town of Stamford on the same front page that describes the elaborate wine cellars being built in local homes (''House Wine Gets Its Own Room'' and ''A Tale of 2 Schools, but Only 1 Building,'' May 7).</p>
        <p>The same population that spends lavishly on a home for liquor is too frugal to invest in the education of manual laborers -- the same population that does the sort of skilled carpentry work in such demand.</p>

        <p>It was cruel irony to have placed the article about the pressure to cede the building that houses the area's only technical high school to the town of Stamford on the same front page that describes the elaborate wine cellars being built in local homes (''House Wine Gets Its Own Room'' and ''A Tale of 2 Schools, but Only 1 Building,'' May 7).</p>
        <p>The same population that spends lavishly on a home for liquor is too frugal to invest in the education of manual laborers -- the same population that does the sort of skilled carpentry work in such demand.</p>
        <p>But, on second thought, it is probably true that both are reflections of the same economic phenomena. Stamford ''needs'' the tech school space in order to improve its schools, which in turn attract wealth and support real estate values. The wine cellars are ''needed'' in order to support fragile egos.</p>
        <p>Fulfullment of such needs is shortsighted in the extreme, to the extent that they marginalize the very people we require to keep things in working order.</p>
        <p>Instead, we need to do more to insure that all forms of talent are nurtured equally in our schools.</p>
