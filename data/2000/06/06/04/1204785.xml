        <p>IT'S time for the latest installment of ''Who Wants to Second-Guess a Billionaire?'' In today's episode, Craig O. McCaw, the publicity-shy cable television and telecommunications entrepreneur with a fabled knack for anticipating the future, hits quicksand in his pursuit of a high-risk dream.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCaw's investments include a maze of advanced wired and wireless services. But none presents a more formidable puzzle than Teledesic, his futuristic scheme to dot the heavens with a 288-satellite network for voice and data communications.</p>
        <p>To most satellite experts, Teledesic's prospects have always seemed uncertain. But the outlook for attracting investors would appear to be considerably gloomier now that the spectacular bankruptcy of the Iridium phone system, problems in several other satellite ventures and the relentless advances of land-based competitors have confirmed Wall Street's worst fears about how tough it is to build a successful satellite business.</p>
        <p>Teledesic is already scaled back from the mind-boggling 840-satellite system Mr. McCaw first announced in 1994 and the start of service has been delayed from 2001 to 2005. Still, the venture Mr. McCaw has referred to as ''an Internet in the sky'' remains by far the most ambitious commercial project in space.</p>
        <p>Just last month, Mr. McCaw and his backers put up $1.2 billion to take control of bankrupt ICO Global Communications, a smaller satellite venture. But that hardly made the outlook any clearer. ICO could, as Mr. McCaw contends, be a steppingstone to Teledesic. Some experts, however, predict it will become the rationale for scaling back Teledesic into a more marketable venture.</p>
        <p>For now though, Teledesic continues to grandly promise nothing less than a full array of high-speed video, data, and voice services to the vast portions of the planet beyond the reach of today's ground-based wired and wireless networks.</p>
        <p>''He's thinking of tens of millions of customers for satellites,'' said Samuel A. Farrer Jr., a Reston, Va.-based satellite expert. ''No one else is talking those numbers.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps no one else would dare to. In an age of singular entrepreneurs who have achieved unfathomable wealth by leading the charge into the Information Age, the 50-year-old Mr. McCaw has been among the boldest, repeatedly going deeply into debt to buy licenses and communications properties that soared in value as he improved them and new technology spread.</p>
        <p>Associates say they have often talked of the need to be ''90 percent'' certain before embarking on a new investment or strategy. ''But Craig's feeling of 90 percent was often Craig alone,'' said Wayne Perry, who was a young Seattle attorney helping an equally youthful Mr. McCaw buy cable television companies when he went to work full time for him in 1975. ''It might be 40 percent to someone else.''</p>
        <p>To understand the complexity of the challenges facing Teledesic, consider the hurdles that were already in its path when Iridium collapsed last summer.</p>
        <p>TO START with, rapidly evolving and expanding terrestrial services have been chipping away at the parts of the world for which satellites had been the only option.</p>
        <p>Moreover, demand for satellite systems is certain to be fragmented among services already in orbit or soon to be there. Teledesic's focus is on computer users at fixed sites rather than mobile customers like ICO Global and other satellite phone companies. But those who might compete in certain segments range from international phone companies like Globalstar, a Vodafone Airtouch PLC subsidiary, and regional operators like the Asian Cellular Satellite System as well as proposed high-capacity satellite networks from consortiums led by Hughes Electronics, Alcatel and Lockheed Martin.</p>
        <p>In addition, Teledesic's technical feasibility is still in question. The company has missed deadlines to settle specifications with Motorola, its prime contractor -- which is expected to be replaced by Hughes Space Systems, ICO's prime contractor.</p>
        <p>The need for overseas phone companies to sell Teledesic services locally is another risk factor. ''It's a mess trying to get your partners around the world working together when it's not their core business,'' said J. Armand Musey, who follows the industry for Banc of America Securities in New York.</p>
        <p>But even assuming those hurdles could be completely overcome and the service launched for $10 billion, the lowest estimates around, what then? Teledesic has just two groups of potential customers that seem out of reach of the competition: computer users in remote lands and waters who will pay for the electronic equivalent of an all-you-can-eat buffet and users in the developed world who will pay to have a backup satellite Internet connection.</p>
        <p>''I try to construct a business model with a $10 billion investment and I can't,'' said Mr. Farrer. ''He clearly sees things I don't.''</p>
        <p>Preternatural far-sightedness, though, is part of Mr. McCaw's track record. ''He's the billionaire whom even billionaires find interesting,'' said O. Casey Corr, whose biography of Mr. McCaw, ''Money From Thin Air,'' is scheduled to be published next month by Times Books/Random House.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCaw's admirers include Bill Gates, a childhood acquaintance and now a neighbor, who put $5 million into Teledesic in 1994 after reviewing the business plan on his honeymoon. (He has since added millions more.) Mr. Gates told Fortune magazine in 1996 that Mr. McCaw ''understands the communications business and where it's going better than anyone I know.''</p>
        <p>Detractors tend to have more qualms than criticisms. ''I'm not sure he's a visionary,'' said Michael Cleamon, a San Francisco consultant who has worked with Teledesic. ''He's a gambler.''</p>
        <p>LOYALISTS say that perceptions of Mr. McCaw as an extreme risk-taker underestimate his fanatic attention to escape routes from his bets and his willingness to shift course when conditions change unexpectedly.</p>
        <p>''He always knows where the back door is,'' said Robert Ratliffe, a long-time aide. ''I don't know of a single time where conditions have changed so much that Craig couldn't morph his position into something useful.''</p>
        <p>And therein may be the clue to Teledesic's future. Mr. McCaw and his backers could have acquired Iridium for far less than the sum they are sinking into ICO. But ICO offered a big advantage: None of its 12 planned satellites is in the air yet, and that gives Mr. McCaw's engineers a chance to tinker with the design of both the satellites and the ground stations.</p>
        <p>The McCaw group's stated goal when ICO goes into service in 2003 is not only to sell phone service to mobile customers, as its founders originally planned, but also to deliver email and data. The data capacity will be just an hors d'oeuvre compared to the Teledesic feast, but it will be a step in the direction Mr. McCaw wants to go.</p>
        <p>His latest plan calls for merging the two ventures as soon as possible, generating revenue from ICO to help fund Teledesic, using ICO's connections to local phone companies around the world to market Teledesic, and tailoring Teledesic's satellite network to run traffic through ICO's ground stations, which have already been linked by a high-capacity fiber network.</p>
        <p>Some analysts suspect, though that ICO -- even if it manages to become profitable -- will be less a steppingstone than a path of retreat for Mr. McCaw from his intentions to launch and operate a full-scale Teledesic network.</p>
        <p>After getting ICO running, step two will be to move on to Teledesic, predicts Roger Rusch of Telastra, a consulting firm in Palos Verdes Estates, Calif., that advised bondholders in the ICO bankruptcy. ''But step three,'' he said, ''will be to cancel step two.''</p>
        <p>History suggests, though, that Mr. McCaw will not abandon his grand vision simply because everyone around him sees that as the sensible option. Many of his decisions have been described as intuitive, an attribute Mr. McCaw himself has often ascribed to his severe dyslexia. Unable to digest long documents, he has become a master at sizing up the interests of those he is dealing with and staying focused on fundamental questions, like how potential customers will perceive a new service.</p>
        <p>When his intuitions harden into conviction, associates say, even his most trusted advisers cannot budge him.</p>
        <p>One such occasion was Mr. McCaw's decision to acquire control of Nextel in 1995, according to Tim Donahue, a longtime McCaw executive who is now chief executive of Nextel, the digital wireless carrier based in Reston, Va.</p>
        <p>UNLIKE other cellular phone systems, Nextel grew out of the radio dispatch sector and can easily tie many users into a single conversation. Five years ago, though, Nextel was burdened by debt and by the poor quality of its two-way radio equipment from Motorola, losing hundreds of millions of dollars annually and searching for billions to build out service in the cities where it had licenses.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCaw plunged in anyway, relying in part on Motorola's commitment to improve the system if he became involved. By 1999, Nextel's customer base had more than doubled, its stock was up 600 percent, it was branching out into foreign markets and Microsoft had decided to invest $600 million to develop Nextel Online, an Internet service for Nextel customers. Today, Mr. McCaw and his fellow investors were sitting on a $3.4 billion gain on their investment.</p>
        <p>''He loves big problems with big opportunities,'' said Peter Currie, a senior executive with McCaw Cellular Communications during Teledesic's formative days.</p>
        <p>Even Mr. McCaw's charitable interests have a way of escalating into grand schemes. His effort to return Keiko, the killer whale featured in the movie ''Free Willy,'' to the wild has become a multi-million-dollar project to vastly extend knowledge about the lives of the orcas of the North Atlantic where Keiko, then about 2, was captured in 1979.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCaw's career began prematurely, in tragedy. The second of four sons of J. Elroy and Marion McCaw, a socially prominent and wealthy Seattle couple, it was Craig who, on a visit home from Stanford University, discovered his father dead from a stroke. Although only 19 years old at the time, Craig had been the son most interested in the family's financial affairs, including a small cable television business where he worked during the summer, and he was quickly accepted as the primary manager of the family's interests going forward.</p>
        <p>Sorting out Elroy's estate was no simple task. The elder McCaw had been an avid dealmaker and borrower who loathed documentation and paid little attention to the actual operations of the businesses he owned. But Craig quickly set about expanding the family's cable investments as soon as the legal clouds lifted.</p>
        <p>In 1974, Mr. McCaw began adding paging businesses to the portfolio. Seven years later, when the Federal Communications Commission licensed the first cellular phone companies, he was an active bidder.</p>
        <p>MR. McCaw prided himself on beating industry service standards. Unlike his father, he concluded early on that happy customers produce more revenue, which helps support more rapid expansion. But he became best known for his willingness to borrow what seemed like astronomical sums to bid aggressively for new properties, confident that they would grow rapidly enough to cover his soaring debts. He was sure that latecomers to the cellular business would pay far higher prices.</p>
        <p>Eventually, Mr. McCaw focused on building a nationwide network of cellular phone licenses, in the belief that customers would be attracted to any service that allowed them to roam freely at a reasonable cost with a minimum of trouble. The value of such freedom seemed obvious to a man who preferred flying, kayaking, sailing and camping in remote regions of western Canada to working in his office. (Water pistol wars tend to erupt when Mr. McCaw is stuck at work too long, according to Mr. Ratliffe.)</p>
        <p>To build up a war chest for the increasingly expensive battles for cellular territories, he unsentimentally sold his family's cable television business for $755 million in 1986 and, with the help of Michael Milken, became a major issuer of high-yield bonds.</p>
        <p>His reputation for making risks pay off was established by the wealth generated in cable television. It exploded into the realm of business legend when he sold McCaw Cellular to AT&amp;T for $11.5 billion in 1996.</p>
        <p>''He is like a great painter,'' said Steven Rattner, who as an investment banker at Lazard Freres was involved in many of Mr. McCaw's dealings. ''He doesn't paint the same thing twice, but you can see similarities in the brush strokes.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McCaw's satellite plans provide the most obvious test of such skills, but they are hardly Mr. McCaw's only concern at the moment. Through Eagle River Inc., an investment firm based in this Seattle suburb, he has controlling interests in both Nextel  and Nextlink, which provides businesses with high-capacity telecommunications and Internet services in the United States and Europe. In February, Mr. McCaw gathered $470 million to fund the expansion of Nextel's network into secondary and rural markets by spinning off Nextel Partners Inc. in a public offering; the 40 percent stake controlled by McCaw through Eagle River or Nextel is currently worth almost $1.9 billion.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCaw has said there is no grand plan to link his telecommunications empire together, but associates like Mr. Donahue, Mr. Perry, and Dan Akerson, chief executive of Nextlink, look for ways the various companies can work with each other. Nextel uses Nextlink networks, and Mr. Perry foresees both companies promoting Teledesic's capacity as a backup service for their business customers.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCaw acknowledged that the companies could end up competing against each other in some areas. ''Our dream, however, is to find ways to make competitive situations more synergistic,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Not that Mr. McCaw would announce a grand plan unless forced by some business need. Teledesic came to light when the company had to file a petition for radio spectrum with the Federal Communications Commission. Those in his inner circle say he is open with them, but often difficult to read. Russell Daggett, vice chairman of Teledesic, says associates have to ''connect the dots'' of McCaw commentary to come up with executable plans, and Dennis Weibling, president of Eagle River and a close financial adviser since 1982, says that Mr. McCaw's good ideas come interspersed with ''things that will make you bankrupt.''</p>
        <p>These days, Mr. McCaw is so wealthy that he has a greater margin of error than early in his career. After remarrying in 1998 following a bitter divorce in 1997, then becoming a father for the first time, he also has less of his life wrapped up in making his business bets pay off. Where he once kept his aircraft, yachts and other toys deployed to make business and vacations as convenient as possible, he now juggles them to support family life, although not always with the same success.</p>
        <p>''No amount of infrastructure can keep you on schedule with kids,'' he recently told a bemused Mr. Ratliffe.</p>
        <p>BUT Mr. McCaw remains fascinated by the satellite opportunity and is unlikely to retreat drastically anytime soon. His interest began in 1986, when he explored putting satellites in orbit above the Indian and western Pacific oceans to serve Asia.</p>
        <p>It was rekindled in 1990 when Ed Tuck, a pioneer in using satellites to pinpoint the location of boaters, hikers and others with handheld transmitters, suggested using satellites in low-earth orbits for a global phone system that would not suffer the disruptive delays that plagued calls using geo-stationary satellites in high orbits.</p>
        <p>In Mr. McCaw's hands, the vision expanded to encompass a variety of computer applications that could benefit from eliminating that signal lag, known as latency. The devil was in the details: No one could see how Teledesic could afford, much less control, the 840 satellites in the original plan, which would be constantly shifting their positions in relation to the earth's surface. Beyond that, no one had ever secured permission from regulators around the world to use the broad swath of high-frequency radio spectrum Teledesic wanted for such communications.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCaw handed the challenge to Mr. Daggett, a lawyer by training, and has yet to look back. Today, Teledesic has its regulatory approvals. It also has big name investors like Boeing ($100 million), Motorola ($750 million, including assets from Celestri, a planned network that was folded into Teledesic), and Prince Alwaleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia ($200 million).</p>
        <p>Teledesic's new headquarters in Bellevue, Wash., presents a thrifty facade: it is the back half of a warehouse abutting a railroad line in an industrial section of town. But inside is a confidently over-budget mixture of cool and whimsy, complete with an on-site coffee bar.</p>
        <p>Before the ICO deal, the apparent prosperity could not quell reports that Teledesic's progress had stalled. Indeed, if anyone but Mr. McCaw had been involved, Teledesic would probably have been dismissed long ago.</p>
        <p>''But McCaw is someone you never bet against,'' said Mr. Musey.</p>
