        <p>Tourists who set foot in Manhattan can choose from a backpack full of maps that detail a great many things, from bus routes and subway stations to ethnic restaurants and famous monuments. Now there's one more: the Ad Map, a satirical online map that charts advertisements like the World Wrestling Federation billboard in Times Square and a Gap wallscape hanging on the side of a building at 125th Street in Harlem.</p>
        <p>The map, which went online last month, was put together by Carrie McLaren, the editor and publisher of Stay Free! magazine, a nonprofit publication that explores commercialism and American culture.

        <p>Tourists who set foot in Manhattan can choose from a backpack full of maps that detail a great many things, from bus routes and subway stations to ethnic restaurants and famous monuments. Now there's one more: the Ad Map, a satirical online map that charts advertisements like the World Wrestling Federation billboard in Times Square and a Gap wallscape hanging on the side of a building at 125th Street in Harlem.</p>
        <p>The map, which went online last month, was put together by Carrie McLaren, the editor and publisher of Stay Free! magazine, a nonprofit publication that explores commercialism and American culture. It features tongue-in-cheek commentary and photographs of 14 advertisements with arrows pointing to their locations on a Manhattan map.</p>
        <p>''Our hope in making it is to awaken some public debate about public space and who owns it,'' Ms. McLaren said.</p>
        <p>The map was born out of the concern that there were no places in Manhattan where a person could turn 360 degrees without seeing an ad. But Ms. McLaren put that fear to rest, she said, when she and her friends found several residential areas where the full circle could be made. They scoured 20-block stretches of Manhattan, looking for noteworthy ads and other evidence of commercialization.</p>
        <p>''A lot of people don't want these monstrous signs,'' Ms. McLaren said. ''You can turn a page, you can turn off a television, but there's no way to turn off a billboard.''</p>
        <p>On May 27, Ms. McLaren gave away printed copies of the guide in Times Square. Copies will also be added as supplements in the next issue of Stay Free!</p>
        <p>WHAT YOU SEE -- A scanned 17-by-11-inch copy of the print map, with different colors designating areas where advertising density is high, medium and low. A legend indicates areas with large billboards (marked with an icon of an octopus); areas protected by residential zoning (icon of a monkey covering his eyes); and areas with billboard lights (icon of a spotlight). Major billboard vandalism is marked with an icon of a hand holding a can of spray paint.</p>
        <p>There is an interactive option, at which numbers can be clicked to view photographs or their accompanying commentary.</p>
        <p>''Discussion Zone'' is a forum for posting opinions about outdoor advertising, and ''How You Can Help'' tells how to get in touch with government officials, among other things.</p>
        <p>LINKS -- To organizations that work to combat commercialization: Billboard Liberation Front; Critical Path; the Public Space Group of the Lower East Side Collective; Reverend Billy of the Church of Stop Shopping; and Scenic America.</p>
        <p>WHAT YOU GET -- A humorous look at New York's great outdoors that, perhaps, shouldn't be taken too lightly.</p>
