        <p>Not a Face to Launch Many Ships at All</p>
        <p>The statue of Queen Catherine of Braganza, once slated for a prime waterfront throne in the borough named for her (Queens, not Braganza), has had a horrible couple of years. Her supporters dwindled, her face was rearranged, and now, the woman who designed her has described her in a lawsuit in Federal District Court in a way no royal portraitist would dare. To wit: her nostrils are too large and uneven, the whites of her eyes are different sizes, her forehead has caved in, her lower lip protrudes too much and her chin has doubled. (The picture shows a 1994 model.)</p>

        <p>Not a Face to Launch Many Ships at All</p>
        <p>The statue of Queen Catherine of Braganza, once slated for a prime waterfront throne in the borough named for her (Queens, not Braganza), has had a horrible couple of years. Her supporters dwindled, her face was rearranged, and now, the woman who designed her has described her in a lawsuit in Federal District Court in a way no royal portraitist would dare. To wit: her nostrils are too large and uneven, the whites of her eyes are different sizes, her forehead has caved in, her lower lip protrudes too much and her chin has doubled. (The picture shows a 1994 model.)</p>
        <p>Audrey Flack, the Manhattan-based sculptor, is suing those involved in financing and casting the 35-foot-tall statue.</p>
        <p>The Friends of Queen Catherine raised about $2 million to build and place it across the East River from the United Nations building, but critics complained that the 17th-century queen of England, born in Portugal, had ties to the slave trade, and the project seemed to stall. In March 1999, Ms. Flack discovered that the molds and clay model for the statue's face, not yet cast, had been damaged at the Tallix foundry in Beacon, N.Y., and an assistant of Ms. Flack's was asked to make repairs.</p>
        <p>Unsatisfied with the results, Ms. Flack is suing the Friends of Queen Catherine and the foundry. She is asking for millions in damages and wants to prevent the statue from being cast with the new molds. ''I cannot let a piece go out that doesn't meet the standards of my work,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But in recent court papers, Michael S. Oberman, the lawyer for Friends of Queen Catherine, disagreed.</p>
        <p>''The simple and undisputed fact is that neither F.Q.C. nor Tallix wanted the truly regrettable sequence of events that resulted from the political controversy over the Queen Catherine project,'' he said. ''In many respects, F.Q.C. is the most injured party here, for its mission has been wholly thwarted. It should not be held liable for its own misfortune.''</p>
        <p>Efforts to get a response from the lawyer for the foundry were unsuccessful.</p>
        <p>A Famous Face Is Staying Active</p>
        <p>There is, admittedly, something cheeky about asking someone what he has been up to since he stopped making headlines. Faced with that question recently, former Representative Stephen Solarz launched into a story about a woman he had met at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago.</p>
        <p>''She said, 'Weren't you somebody?' '' he recalled, laughing. ''I said, 'I'd like to think I still am.' ''</p>
        <p>Since 1992, when he lost a primary while seeking his 10th term in Congress, Mr. Solarz, an 18-year member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, has maintained his interest in international affairs, monitoring elections in Cambodia, the Dominican Republic and Bangladesh. He works both as an independent consultant in Washington and as a consultant with Apco Associates, with clients like Aetna and India and Singapore.</p>
        <p>Mr. Solarz, 59, is vice chairman of the International Crisis Group, consisting of former national leaders, diplomats and analysts working to prevent man-made disasters like the outbreaks of violence in Kosovo, Rwanda and East Timor.</p>
        <p>Mostly, he said, he enjoys spending time with his two granddaughters, who live around the corner from him in McLean, Va.</p>
