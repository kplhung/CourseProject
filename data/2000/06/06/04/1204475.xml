        <p>THE question is, just how deep a wilderness experience can you get in a long weekend without ever leaving New England?</p>
        <p>The short answer is: Pretty deep.</p>
        <p>The longer answer, reached after three days in the Moosehead Lake region of central Maine, is:</p>
        <p>You can go on an eight-hour hike deep into the North Woods, passing one roaring churn of a waterfall after another along the way, and meet nary another soul until you limp back to the parking lot and run right into the nice state wardens who are getting worried enough to start searching for you.</p>
        <p>You can spend the night in a canvas-walled yurt, miles of woods away from the nearest people, wake up to a view of sky through the roof and have the euphoria of outdoor sleeping without even lugging a tent.</p>
        <p>You can fly over lake after lake after pristine lake to an isolated cabin of your own, and know that when you canoe your territorial waters, there may be moose or deer to challenge you but no other humans.</p>
        <p>And you can fall asleep to such a magically crazy chorus of clacks and cheeps and peeps and hoots that it seems as sacrilegious as sleeping through a live symphony concert.</p>
        <p>Also, you can bring home an old bearskin rug or a stuffed moose head to go above your mantel if you are so barbarically inclined.</p>
        <p>All these were conclusions my gear-laden friend, Stephen Lines, a photographer, and I reached on a Friday-to-Sunday trip in May. It took us from Boston to Greenville -- the town known as the gateway of the Moosehead Lake region -- to nearby Rockwood, to remote Mooseleuk Lake and back again.</p>
        <p>(Please note: The trip was in May, not June. Only the rhinoceros-skinned would want to visit inland Maine during black-fly season. But locals say that most of the nasty biters are usually gone by the end of June, sometimes earlier.)</p>
        <p>I'll get to the natural beauty next, but first, my main point about wilderness: If hell is other people, then shouldn't heaven be about getting away from them? And have you noticed how, when you encounter fellow travelers out in a forest or on a mountain or on an ocean where you want to feel as if  you're exploring, you tend to resent their existence a million times more than if they jostled you on a city street?</p>
        <p>I mention that because our Moosehead trip provided such satisfying alone-space. No other hikers on the trails -- though there would likely be a few in summer -- no other cars on the road to Greenville for nearly a two-hour late-night stretch, no other kayakers out where we kayaked, no other canoeists where we canoed. There was more than breathing room; there was the feeling of dominion captured in the Dr. Seuss book about Yertle the Turtle, who was king of all he saw.</p>
        <p>And furthermore, it was affordable dominion, with cabins advertised for sale in the Northwoods Sporting Journal at $20,000 or so, your own little yurt rental running just $55 a night, and your own little cabin, replete with beds for eight, gaslights and canoes for $100 a night. Some souvenirs did get pricey: the stuffed moose heads available at Moosehead Traders on Main Street in Greenville ran well over $1,000 each.</p>
        <p>Moosehead Lake is a noble old outdoor destination, and its ''camps'' -- Mainespeak for the rustic sites ranging from simple cabins to fancy lodges -- have drawn hunters, fishermen and nature lovers for well over a century. Henry David Thoreau described the region in his ''Maine Woods,'' but anyone writing about the place always quotes Thoreau, so let's just leave it at that.</p>
        <p>The lake itself is about 35 miles long, the largest in Maine and the one of largest lakes  in one single state in New England. It is peppered with islands, some uninhabited, some housing camps, and it can get as wild as a sea, with great rollers and gales. (Oh, O.K., Thoreau described it as a ''suitably wild-looking sheet of water, sprinkled with small, low islands.'')</p>
        <p>The region around it is splotched with dozens more lakes, with Indian names like Nahmakanta and Munsungan and Matagamon. The Appalachian Trail winds through it, on its way to its northern terminus on nearby Mount Katahdin, but most of the land is unprotected paper-company territory, riddled with logging roads, much of it in various stages of regrowth.</p>
        <p>Moosehead is still a major center for the fish and game set, but it appears to have been shifting a bit in recent years away from the red-plaid folk and toward the Patagonia purple bunch. Mountain biking has been taking off here, and kayaking, and ''moose safaris'' in which the moose survives. Certainly, even for us gunless, rodless visitors, there was far more to do than a weekend could encompass.</p>
        <p>We flew out of Boston to Bangor on one of the frequent 70-minute flights run by Business Express, a subsidiary of American Airlines, grabbed a car in Bangor and reached Greenville in well under a two-hour drive. There is an unexpected vista as you drive into Greenville, when the gigantic lake and its islands suddenly spread themselves serenely out before you.</p>
        <p>The plan was to proceed immediately to Gulf Hagas, taking the eight-hour loop hike through what is billed as the four-mile-long Grand Canyon of Maine. (This lofty claim occasioned some derision from us as the hike began, but as we proceeded, we shut up. The walls may be nowhere near as high, and granite gray rather than ruddy, but the rushing, crashing, warbling beauty at the bottom demands reverence.)</p>
        <p>First, however, we made a lingering stop in Greenville at Auntie M's, a home-cookin' restaurant whose moderately priced menu ranges from an all-you-can-eat fish fry to nonalcoholic daiquiris to nachos. The member of our party who routinely gets to eat as much as he wants pronounced both the apple crisp and the fried dough delicious; the member of our party who doesn't get to eat as much as she wants, even when she hikes for miles and miles, had a delectable frozen orange milkshake.</p>
        <p>From Greenville, the trailhead of the Gulf Hagas hike was reachable only over miles upon miles of roads so marginally passable that the locals in four-wheel-drive vehicles we met raised eyebrows and exclaimed that we must be pretty fancy drivers to get so far in a mere car. We had followed the directions on a Moosehead hiking site, but discovered later that access by road was much easier from Brownville.</p>
        <p>In any case, after about an hour of abusing the rental car and exhorting each other to keep accelerating through the muddy ruts, we reached a little park service cabin with a sign outside reading, ''One Old Grouch and One Nice Person Live Here.'' I speculated that the old man who took our $7 per person was the grouch, but he claimed it was his wife.</p>
        <p>What followed was eight hours of challenging, satisfying footwork, from the initial precarious barefooting across a wide, thigh-high river to the innumerable viewpoints the Rim Trail afforded of large, small and middling waterfalls. The hike consists of several loops, and so can be cut to just two or three hours for the less ambitious. But we driven types were at it until well after dark, thanks to my ever-prepared friend's zoom-lens headlamps.</p>
        <p>After a pleasant enough encounter -- well, with overtones of teenager-over-curfew sheepishness -- with the wardens who were just about to come looking for us, we drove to the Birches, which the guidebooks tend to call the premier resort on Moosehead Lake. From the Gulf Hagas area near Brownville, it was a good two-hour drive to the resort in Rockwood, a tiny town north of Greenville.</p>
        <p>The Birches, which is known for cross-country skiing as well as snowless fun, has an old-style central lodge that does the Maine thing right down to the great stone fireplace, along with 15 hand-hewn cabins strung along the lakeside.</p>
        <p>And then, it has the yurts. So why did we stay in a yurt? Well, have you ever stayed in a yurt? I don't know. It seemed different. Also, in the quest to avoid other humans, it doesn't seem to make much sense to fly hundreds of miles from civilization and then stay in a little cluster of cabins where you can hear your neighbors cough.</p>
        <p>So the yurt it was, and a pleasant little yurt it seemed. The Birches has three of them on its 11,000 acres of wilderness preserve, each sleeping four people. Ours had a bunk bed and futon, plus pillows, linens, a wood stove and a gas stove, plenty of chopped wood and a five-gallon container of water. Morning in the clearing where it stands was so serene it brought to mind the famous Yeats line from ''The Lake Isle of Innisfree'' about living in a ''bee-loud glade.''</p>
        <p>THE Birches was not serving lunch that day, but its managers were hospitably easy about letting us take a couple of kayaks from their boathouse, which is super-well-equipped because the resort also runs wilderness trips.</p>
        <p>Against their cautious warnings about possible rough winds, we paddled the 45-minute route across the temporarily calm lake to Mount Kineo, a peninsula that is considered Moosehead's most striking landmark. Its looming granite cliff rises 763 feet from the lake and, the guidebooks say, was holy to American Indians, whose legends turned it into the petrified corpse of a giant, sin-avenging moose. There was, sadly, no time to hike or rock-climb to the top of Kineo, where the view is reputed to be one of the best in New England.</p>
        <p>We had a plane to catch. Taking to the air is one of the Moosehead musts, if simply for a 15-minute tourist ride, and with good reason. Only then, and especially with a well-informed pilot like ours, does the big picture emerge: the many rivers dammed into lakes, the lakes expanded and contracted, the river flow reversals, the timber-harvesting patterns, the rare swaths of untouched forest, the moundlike mountains and great snowy Katahdin in the distance.</p>
        <p>We zipped back down to Greenville to the seaplane base of Folsom's, one of three air companies on the lake, and took off for Mooseleuk Lake, about a 45-minute flight away. (An airsickness bag is recommended if it's a bumpy day.)</p>
        <p>Our cabin there was one of a dozen outpost cabins owned by Libby Camps, whose motto is ''A wilderness tradition since 1890.'' There are dozens of other camps to stay in around the Moosehead region, but most seem to be in those annoying little clusters. Libby's offered cabins isolated not only from the rest of the world but also from one another. And it billed marshy Mooseleuk Lake as one of the best wildlife-watching areas in Maine. (Which it probably is, if you get up early. I'm embarrassed to say I wouldn't know.)</p>
        <p>The one-room cabin was exquisitely homey, from the welcoming wood stove and the front porch to the 20-seat picnic table and the polished wooden floor. It slept eight, and seemed to be begging for a 1950's family whose Mom would stay home and cook flapjacks while Dad went out after deer. There was even a cookbook of camp recipes.</p>
        <p>But its most interesting document was a guestbook full of the scribblings of a decade of visitors. They ranged from heartless listings like ''25 grouse, (party of 6) eight moose, six deer, camp was great!'' to ''Not many fish but bugs plentiful, p.s. saw MANY moose'' and ''Seem to be a few bugs!?''</p>
        <p>My favorite was the entry from a newlywed couple who wrote, ''Here to get off the world for a few days.''</p>
        <p>That seemed about right. And who would think you could get this well off of it, this nearby?</p>
        <p>If you go</p>
