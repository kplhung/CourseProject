        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In her book, ''The Kinder, Gentler Military,'' my daughter Stephanie Gutmann cited my service as a sailor for the Haganah -- the Jewish underground organization that, in defiance of a British blockade, organized the clandestine immigration of Jewish Holocaust survivors to Palestine. But in her critical review (May 7), Carol Gilligan uses the father's story to attack the daughter's celebration of the United States armed forces' ''warrior culture.'' Thus, in Gilligan's view, my history of civil disobedience against the British demonstrates that one can be a fighter without being a murderous warrior. It somehow follows, then, that armies can become kinder and gentler; they can demobilize the masculine warrior culture, presumably without any loss of martial effectiveness.</p>

It somehow follows, then, that armies can become kinder and gentler; they can demobilize the masculine warrior culture, presumably without any loss of martial effectiveness.</p>
        <p>But early on I learned the opposite lessons: my experience with unarmed resistance to the British crown only confirmed for me the need for real warriors. Lacking guns, we Haganah sailors were helpless when Royal Navy marines seized our unarmed ships and hauled young Jewish survivors off to yet another stinking prison camp, this time on Cyprus. Love was not enough: it took guns, warriors and killing to complete the rescue mission that our voyages of peaceful resistance could only begin. Before the orphans of the Holocaust could finally reach haven in the new state of Israel, Jewish warriors had to fight a bloody battle for Haifa Port, they had to hold the new country against the invading Arab armies, and Jewish warships had to secure the sea lanes from Europe and Cyprus. Stephanie Gutmann is right: love and war are not inevitably in conflict, but form a paradoxical unity. Until all the lions lie down with all the lambs, the ports of refuge and the islands of decency have to be secured by disciplined soldiers who are prepared to kill as well as to die.</p>
