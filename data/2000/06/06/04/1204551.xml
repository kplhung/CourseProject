        <p>THE extraordinary popularity of ''Antiques Roadshow'' on public television has made us more sensitive to the treasures that lie all around, just waiting to be discovered. The antiques business is flourishing. Just before Memorial Day weekend I took an exploratory tour, starting from Eastport and ending in East Hampton, where my stamina ran out. In a driving distance of 40 miles, I counted no fewer than 27 antique shops.</p>
        <p>''I met a traveller from an antique land'' begins a famous poem by Shelley that we had to learn in school. I had always wondered where the antique land was, and now I know. It's on the South Fork, where selling antiques seems to be the main industry in whole towns and villages.</p>
        <p>The meaning of the word ''antique'' has suffered some change over time. The official definition is that antiques must be at least 100 years old. The Oxford English Dictionary says, ''Having existed since olden times, old, aged or venerable.'' But the frontier of antiquity is moving closer all the time. In one of the first stores I visited, I found an exact replica of my favorite typewriter, a 1939 Royal, which is still in daily use. There were black telephones with dials, toasters, cameras and bicycles that looked perfectly serviceable to me. Rusty garden tools, push lawnmowers and wind-up clocks were displayed like relics from an Egyptian tomb. One store had a whole range of kitchen tools exactly like those we have at home.</p>
        <p>Things improved as I continued my search. I realized that I was following the same route as the antiques themselves, from west to east: Their odyssey begins at the tag sales and flea markets up-Island, then filter down through Eastport and on to East Hampton. About one in a billion of the most select pieces finds its way back west, to the big auction houses in New York.</p>
        <p>The dream of the serious antiquer is to catch an object at the halfway point, before its value has been inflated to the point of madness. It is a fairly random process, like running a metal detector over a beach. Whatever promising object you pick up, some earlier (and better-informed) treasure seeker has picked up and put down again.</p>
        <p>The cheaper and newer an object is, the more likely it is to be genuine. Almost everything that looks old is restored or reconstructed or simply faked. If you are going after serious antiques, a few hours in the library is a better investment than any amount of innocent trust. You can learn the mystical language of the profession, and look for the tiny clues -- patina, wear, oxidation, tool marks -- that separate the winners from the losers in this game.</p>
        <p>Colonial objects are extraordinarily desirable and remarkably common. But remember that the whole population of Long Island in Colonial times would have fit three times into the Nassau Coliseum. They also had to work hard at farming and fishing, just to survive. It's hard to see how they found time to make the vast numbers of genuine Colonial antiques that now fill the stores. A sociologist once calculated that each family in the original 13 colonies must have owned at least 200 chairs and 700 warming pans in order to supply today's antiques market.</p>
        <p>But it is possible to enjoy antique shops without worrying about authenticity. They offer such an intriguing window into the past. What must it have been like to have all this junk in your home? Our ancestors seem to have had a passion for glass, china and ceramic objects of incredible ugliness, hideous lamps, unsittable chairs and nauseating oil paintings. People really were made of sterner stuff in those days.</p>
        <p>The curious awfulness of most antiques raises the question: How does something survive to become an antique and end up in a store alongside Montauk Highway? The moment you ask the question, the answer is obvious.</p>
        <p>Almost everything you see in a modern antique shop was a gift, usually a wedding gift. It went straight into the basement or the attic when it was brand new. If you actually use furniture and china, it eventually breaks and gets thrown away. Only the really ugly, never-used wedding-gift stuff survives into the next century to horrify the browsers in antique stores. Our ancestors probably had perfectly good taste. It's just that none of their real possessions have come down to us.</p>
        <p>It's also intriguing to wonder about the antique shop of the future. If the present trend continues, almost every retail outlet on Long Island will be selling antiques by the year 2100. What will they have on display? How will our children's children imagine the 2000's, as seen through the detritus of our busy lives?</p>
        <p>''Gee, great-grandma must have used a clunky old computer just like this. Look at these two-dimensional video games, how cute.''</p>
        <p>Even worse, the same old wedding gifts may be recycling through the attics and garage sales and antique shops of the Island for the umpteenth time, and the present will look as tasteless in the future as the past does in the present.</p>
        <p>I am all in favor of preserving our past, but there has to be a limit. Nostalgia has become an industry, and I prefer nostalgia the way it used to be.</p>
