        <p>He said he did nothing to betray the country he adopted decades ago, but Cuban-born Mariano Faget, a high-ranking supervisor in the Miami office of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, is facing five years in prison after being convicted on espionage charges.</p>
        <p>Mr. Faget was found guilty of disclosing classified information, converting it for his own gain, lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and failing to reveal foreign business contacts on federal documents. He is involved in a company planning to do business in Cuba when the American embargo is lifted.</p>
