        <p>FOR months, federal regulators have been looking into whether people who invest in variable annuities are getting a fair shake.</p>
        <p>Now, while the regulators continue to gather information from brokerage firms and financial advisers across the country for possible sanctions, the Securities and Exchange Commission is sending up a red flag on these controversial but increasingly popular investments, which are basically a combination of mutual funds and insurance.</p>
        <p>Tomorrow, according to S.E.C. officials, the agency plans to take the unusual step of publishing an investor alert on its Web site, www.sec.gov, on the pitfalls of variable annuities.</p>
        <p>Most recently, the agency used an alert to emphasize to investors that dazzling past performances of mutual funds might not be reason for future investments. But the S.E.C. has not previously sounded a warning on variable annuities, which were developed by insurance companies to attract some of the billions going into mutual funds and which lately have been accumulating money from investors at a faster clip than standard, less expensive mutual funds.</p>
        <p>Reflecting concerns that sales representatives often do not tell potential customers all they need to know about variable annuities -- and certainly do not emphasize the drawbacks -- the S.E.C. document, ''Variable Annuities: What You Should Know,'' reads like a sober antidote to a salesman's smooth patter. It is filled with cautionary passages clearly designed to make a potential buyer stop and think whether he or she really would want to put money into an investment that financially penalizes those who might need cash in less than six or seven years and charges for features, like a lifelong stream of payments after retirement, that are rarely used.</p>
        <p>And speaking in the restrained voice of government, the agency warns, in particular, that bonuses now being offered as a lure by many variable annuity companies ''may not be in your best interest.''</p>
        <p>Some industry executives complain that companies that pay customers bonuses of 3 or 4 percent to get them to switch their variable annuity investments often make potential buyers think they are getting something for nothing. But the S.E.C. alert points out that this may not be  the case. ''Higher expenses can outweigh the benefits'' of a bonus, the agency says. It lists several ways, not always obvious, by which variable annuity companies take back the bonus payments, including higher penalties for withdrawals and extending the periods over which such penalties apply.</p>
        <p>''Before purchasing a variable annuity with a bonus credit,'' the agency says in its alert, ''you need to ask yourself -- and the financial professional who is trying to sell you the contract -- whether the bonus is worth more to you than any increased charges you will pay.''</p>
        <p>One of the pioneers of variable annuity bonuses, American Skandia, just this year became the No. 1 selling variable annuity company, taking the lead away from Hartford Life, which, until a few months ago, had not offered bonuses.</p>
        <p>Mark Mackey, chief executive of the National Association for Variable Annuities, said he had not seen the S.E.C. document but that he agreed with the agency that there should be full disclosure. He added that bonus annuities were suitable for some people and that it was up to sales representatives to ''be familiar with their clients' circumstances.''</p>
        <p>WHILE one of the main advantages of variable annuities over mutual funds is that investments are not taxed until the time of withdrawal, the agency notes that Individual Retirement Accounts and 401(k) retirement plans, which offer the same feature at no cost, ''are often more advantageous than variable annuities.''</p>
        <p>Several pending lawsuits accuse variable annuity companies of inappropriately selling variable annuities to IRA and 401(k) investors, giving them a useless, double tax deferral feature at a higher expense than if mutual funds had been used.</p>
        <p>Another seldom-used feature of variable annuities is a guarantee that an investor's heirs will receive at least the original investment, regardless of how poorly the market performs. But long-term investors rarely fail to at least break even. Again, the agency advises, before paying the extra money for a variable annuity, ''Carefully consider whether you need the benefit.''</p>
