        <p>Jaron Lanier, pioneer in virtual reality, and Robert Moog, inventor of eponymous synthesizer, will perform Terry Riley's 1964 minimalist piece, In C, in July 13 concert, as part of Lincoln Center Festival 2000 (S)</p>

        <p>Some performers better known for developing corporations and new technology will come together for an electronic concert on July 13 cooked up by the Lincoln Center Festival 2000. In a maximalist performance of a minimalist piece, ''In C,'' that Terry Riley composed in 1964, Jaron Lanier, the virtual reality pioneer whose company was acquired by the Thomson electronics group, will add an apparently anachronistic element of virtual reality (don't ask). Robert Moog who introduced synthesizers to concert halls, recording sessions and countless Ramada Inn lounges -- will play what everyone would expect him to play. ''It should be a hoot,'' Mr. Moog said last week.</p>

        <p>Mr. Moog remains president and owner of the Big Briar Company in Asheville, N.C., an electronic musical instrument maker for 22 years. After much legal wrangling, he recently regained undisputed control of the Moog trademark.</p>
