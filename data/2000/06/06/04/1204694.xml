      <block class="full_text">
        <p>He's only three-foot-eleven and still he doesn't believe it.</p>
        <p>Koko the Killer Clown waddled with  menace around the bar, a miniature baseball bat in his hand. His tiny fists clenched and unclenched its shaft, and his greasepaint smile turned to a frown.</p>
        <p>Another midget stood in the open-air entrance staring stupidly at Koko. ''That guy gives little people a bad name,'' Koko announced to the bar, pointing a sausage-sized finger at the interloper. ''He has his nose in the air and besides he can't dance.''</p>
        <p>The man in the entrance began a soft-shoe accompanied by a whistle blown in sharp, shrill bursts. A little girl looking down on the scene from her bar stool began to cry.</p>
        <p>It was appalling. It was shocking. It was, for the money, entertaining.</p>
        <p>Step right up to the last freak show in America. Once there were hundreds of them, flame swallowers, bearded ladies and two-headed babies. Now there is just Sideshows by the Seashore on the Coney Island peninsula at Surf Avenue and West 12th Street.</p>
        <p>The freak show features the man who puts screwdrivers up his nose and hums little melodies, the snake-charming ladies who from a distance are of an indiscernible sex, the tattooed man, the Killer Clown and sundry other attractions.</p>
        <p>But best of all in this Empire to the Nickel is the little plywood-topped bar littered with grapes, The Racing Form and a newspaper horoscope page. The clock above is stuck at 12 and one second and the sign below it reads: ''It's Time to Buy a Freak a Drink.''</p>
        <p>The freak bar is among the most democratic in the city. From 1 p.m. to midnight, Friday through Sunday, it is lined with feeble ancients, frightened children, new immigrants, outdated suits and people with holes in their shoes who have paid $2 or $3 to watch the revolving show.</p>
        <p>One of the finest ways to see the show is never to see it at all. A better plan is to simply sit at the bar and watch this carousel of outcasts swirl past as you nurse a beer.</p>
        <p>As a rule, freaks don't drink while on the job. This, they explain, is because of a certain professionalism and respect for the occupation. ''Besides,'' says Frank Hartman, 28, the purple-haired barker, sword swallower and escape artist who began his career on the strange stage at the age of 12, ''you don't want to be drunk while you're locked in an iron maiden.''</p>
        <p>Eke the Geek is one of the few men in the city who lists his occupation as showman on his tax forms. He has a tattooed head and is electrocuted on the hour. The Prince of Wales regards his station in life with no less pride than Eke the Geek.  ''I'm the doorkeeper of a dying art,'' he explains with all earnestness.</p>
        <p>It is no wonder then that this giant of a man chases Koko around the lobby after the little clown has interrupted his show to curse the audience into making room for the standing customers.</p>
        <p>''I'm an artist!'' the Geek says. ''How dare you!''</p>
        <p>Koko, a clown from the projects, must be restrained from breaking the Geek's knees with the bat.</p>
        <p>The girl begins to cry again.</p>
