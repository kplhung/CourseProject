        <p>It's Harder in Queens</p>
        <p>Q.: Is New York City water ''hard'' or ''soft''?</p>
        <p>A.: Soft. Hard water is a domestic nuisance, since it is generally not as quick to form suds, leaves spots and a scummy residue, and contains minerals that can recrystallize when heated, plugging pipes and hot water heaters. It can also taste chalky or rusty. Hardness is based on the amount of dissolved sediment -- mostly calcium and some magnesium -- in grains per gallon. Below 3 grains is considered soft.</p>

        <p>It's Harder in Queens</p>
        <p>Q.: Is New York City water ''hard'' or ''soft''?</p>
        <p>A.: Soft. Hard water is a domestic nuisance, since it is generally not as quick to form suds, leaves spots and a scummy residue, and contains minerals that can recrystallize when heated, plugging pipes and hot water heaters. It can also taste chalky or rusty. Hardness is based on the amount of dissolved sediment -- mostly calcium and some magnesium -- in grains per gallon. Below 3 grains is considered soft.</p>
        <p>All but a few city residents are served by the 1,969-square-mile watershed to the north and west, which provides 1.3 billion gallons daily. About 90 percent arrives from the Catskill and Delaware watersheds, according to Geoffrey C. Ryan, spokesman for the Department of Environmental Protection. When tested in 1998, this water averaged a velvety 1.1 grains of sediment per gallon. Mr. Ryan said less than 10 percent of the city's water is drawn from the old Croton system, which averaged 4.9 grains per gallon, considered only moderately hard.</p>
        <p>The city's groundwater system, comprising 27 wells in southeastern Queens, accounts for about 2 percent of the city's total supply. Water in wells tends to act as a solvent, and generally has a higher mineral content. New York well water tested at wildly different levels in 1998, from 1.1 grains to a whopping -- and let's face it, rock-hard -- 24.7 grains per gallon. Hey, Culligan man!</p>
        <p>Airy Ape</p>
        <p>Q.: To mark the 50th anniversary of the movie ''King Kong,'' an inflatable replica of the big ape was attached to the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building and displayed for several days in the early 1980's. What became of the giant balloon?</p>
        <p>A.: Roarrr! Pfffffft! Scheduled to spring to life on the morning of April 7, 1983, the vinyl-coated King Kong balloon only dangled from the building like an empty sack while torrential rains, twisted ropes and a series of fabric tears in the armpits, shoulders and neck delayed the inflation for days. Midtown pedestrians, accustomed to looking down instead of up, continued to do so, even as two hired biplanes buzzed the tower.</p>
        <p>The $150,000 publicity stunt was conceived by Robert K. Vicino, president of a San Diego company that manufactured giant inflatable advertising displays. Plans called for King Kong to tour the world after he left New York, visiting London and Tokyo -- even the Eiffel Tower --  before finding a permanent perch, perhaps back on the Empire State Building itself.</p>
        <p>Since the 3,000-pound balloon was inflated with 600 pounds of cold, compressor-driven air, not helium, the armatures and rigging required were substantial, and the rips and tangles crippling. After struggling round the clock for over a week, the crew finally managed to bring the 10-story balloon to its feet on April 15. Later, the winds picked up again and a 16-foot gash opened in the right shoulder. By the next morning the balloon had deflated again, and the exasperated crew gave up.</p>
        <p>''They brought him in and tried to haul him down the stairs, but he got all ripped and torn,'' said Richard T. Dickson, a former employee of Mr. Vicino's company. ''When they finally got him to the bottom, he was destroyed.''</p>
        <p>La Grande Pomme?</p>
        <p>Q.: Apart from New Amsterdam, has New York City had other European names?</p>
        <p>A.: In August 1673, New York was briefly returned to Dutch rule, and under Governor General Anthony Clove, commander of the fleet that had snatched the town from the English, was re-christened New Orange. When the city was returned to the English in February 1674, ''New York'' was restored.</p>
