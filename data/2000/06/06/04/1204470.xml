        <p>In his review of Tim Hilton's ''John Ruskin: The Later Years'' (May 14), Valentine Cunningham comments that Effie Gray's response to Rose La Touche's parents concerning the reasons for the annulment of her marriage to Ruskin has been lost forever on ''epistolary bonfires.''

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In his review of Tim Hilton's ''John Ruskin: The Later Years'' (May 14), Valentine Cunningham comments that Effie Gray's response to Rose La Touche's parents concerning the reasons for the annulment of her marriage to Ruskin has been lost forever on ''epistolary bonfires.'' In fact, the correspondence between Mrs. La Touche and Effie is very much extant in the Bowerswell Papers at the Morgan Library in New York.</p>
        <p>Rose's mother wrote twice to Effie. John Everett Millais, the Pre-Raphaelite painter Effie married after leaving Ruskin, responded to Mrs. La Touche's first letter, writing that Ruskin's conduct toward his wife had been abominable. Millais then asked that Mrs. La Touche not write again, as any mention to Effie of her previous marriage was so upsetting to her. Mrs. La Touche did, however, write again, and Effie responded to her desperate plea for information. Ruskin, she told Mrs. La Touche, refused to consummate their six-year-long marriage because he insisted Effie had an ''internal disease.'' Words it must have cost the very private Effie a great deal to write, and so stunningly graphic in their simplicity that Mrs. La Touche apprehended in them at once the virulence and pathology of Ruskin's misogyny. Upon reading Effie's letter, Rose immediately broke off her engagement to Ruskin.</p>
