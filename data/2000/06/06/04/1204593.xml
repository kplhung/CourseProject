        <p>REFLECTING the continuing popularity of upscale rental housing, Trammel Crow Residential has started construction on almost 800 luxury apartments in central Suffolk County.</p>
        <p>The development, called Alexan Brookhaven, will have 795 apartments and will occupy 117 acres in South Yaphank between Woodside Avenue and Horse Block Road, east of Station Road-Bellport Avenue.

        <p>REFLECTING the continuing popularity of upscale rental housing, Trammel Crow Residential has started construction on almost 800 luxury apartments in central Suffolk County.</p>
        <p>The development, called Alexan Brookhaven, will have 795 apartments and will occupy 117 acres in South Yaphank between Woodside Avenue and Horse Block Road, east of Station Road-Bellport Avenue. When completed in 2002, the development will be one of the largest rental projects on Long Island.</p>
        <p>Trammell Crow's entry into the Long Island market is another indication that this area is increasingly attracting upscale rental housing that offers many, if not all, of the features of for-sale units, along with extensive recreational amenities.</p>
        <p>The increasing popularity of upscale rental apartments can be traced, in part, to the region's growing number of young professionals, many of them working at high-technology companies, who may be too busy, or too unsure of their next move, to put down permanent roots.</p>
        <p>Rental housing is also attracting older people, former homeowners who have raised their families and sold their houses and who want someone else to attend to all the details, even those as minute as fixing a leaking faucet in the bathroom.</p>
        <p>Developers say that these two groups also  don't want to be locked into homeownership at a time when house prices are high and could turn downward if the economy weakens.</p>
        <p>''Rentals offer a very flexible lifestyle choice,'' said Joseph S. Torg, the development partner in the Northeast division of Trammell Crow's MidAtlantic/Northeast Group, which has offices in Fairfield, Conn. The MidAtlantic side of the partnership has its headquarters in Rockville, Md. Each of the five groups that constitute Trammell Crow Residential, which has its headquarters in Atlanta, is an independently owned partnership.</p>
        <p>''There are plenty of people who can afford to purchase a house but choose not to,'' Mr. Torg said. ''Many people now feel they don't want equity tied up in a house because they can get much better returns on the stock market.''</p>
        <p>The tenant mix in South Yaphank, he said, is also expected to include couples, with or without children, who have not yet saved up enough money to buy a house in today's costly market.</p>
        <p>The biggest difficulty on Long Island, developers say, is not in finding tenants, but in finding land. Preapproved sites like the 117 acres that Trammell Crow bought from Horseblock Associates, an investor group, ''are very hard to find,'' said Paul K. Gruber, the president of PKG Associates of Woodbury, the broker for the $17 million deal.</p>
        <p>The property's apartment zoning dates back to the mid-1980's and might not be granted today. Felix Grucci Jr., the Brookhaven town supervisor, has gone on record several times saying he opposed any housing on the site because the surrounding area is largely industrial.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Torg said the location was a very convenient one. The State University of New York at Stony Brook, the Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, county offices in Riverhead and large employers like Computer Associates International in Islandia and Symbol Technologies in Holtsville are  all close by.</p>
        <p>To attract the different groups of renters, Alexan Brookhaven, designed by the Lessard Architectural Group of Vienna, Va., will have a variety of layouts. The choices  include one- and two-bedroom flats in two-story town-house-style buildings; two- and three-bedroom two-story town houses, some with the master bedroom on the ground floor to accommodate older couples who do not want to climb stairs, and some ranch-style units for tenants who want all the living space on one level without having anyone above them. Each of the units will have direct access to a one-car garage.</p>
        <p>Rents will range from $850 for an 825-square-foot one-bedroom flat to $1,400 for a three-bedroom, 1,250-square-foot town house. The two-bedroom, 1,150-square-foot flat will rent for $1,200 a month, and the three-bedroom 1,300-square-foot ranch-style unit will rent for $1,400. Rents will not include heat or utilities. Leasing for the first phase of 549 apartments is expected to begin at the the end of the year, with the first apartments to be ready for occupancy early in 2001. When complexed, the complex will have as many as four pools, tennis courts and an 8,000-square-foot clubhouse.</p>
        <p>Trammell Crow Residential, which was founded in 1978, is the second national builder to build luxury rentals on Long Island.</p>
        <p>THE other is AvalonBay Communities, a real estate investment trust traded on the New York Stock Exchange. It started out as the Trammell Crow Mid Atlantic/Northeast Group until it went public in 1995 as Avalon. Avalon took the AvalonBay name after a merger in 1998 with a West Coast apartment builder called Bay Communities. A new Trammell Crow Mid Atlantic/Northeast Group was set up in 1997.</p>
        <p>Until 1997, when Avalon opened a 312-unit rental complex in Smithtown called Avalon Commons, the rental stock in Suffolk, where most of the new rental complexes are springing up, consisted largely of brick garden apartments built after World War II.</p>
        <p>Companies like Trammell Crow were building luxury rentals in the Southeast and Southwest long before the idea was brought to the Northeast, said Gary Steinfield, AvalonBay's vice president for development for the New Jersey and Long Island regions. ''The Northeast was a little slower in understanding that people are willing to pay for a better-quality, better-amenitized apartment community,'' he said.</p>
        <p>At Avalon Commons, the apartments are  in two-story town-house-style buildings with clapboard exteriors. They range in size from an 862-square-foot one-bedroom to a  1,527-square-foot two-bedroom with a loft.  Some of the apartments have two bathrooms, and some have fireplaces. Rents range from $1,499 to $1,949. The complex has  a clubhouse, a fitness and business center, a pool and an indoor half court for basketball.  Prices do not include heat or utilities.</p>
        <p>Avalon now owns and operates four complexes on Long Island with a total of 915 apartments. In addition to Avalon Commons in Smithtown, two are in Melville and one is in Long Beach. The most recent to come on the market, the 340-unit Avalon Court North in Melville, opened in April and is already fully occupied, Mr. Steinfield said. Rents there range from $1,600 for a 740-square-foot one-bedroom to $2,299 for a 1,390-square-foot three-bedroom. Seventy-five percent of the apartments have direct access to their own garages. In addition to the pool, tennis court, clubhouse and fitness center that have become standard for these complexes, Avalon Court North also has a putting green and a jogging trail.</p>
        <p>Local developers are also aggressively entering the luxury rental market. Fairfield Properties of Commack had been buying  and upgrading older apartment complexes for 27 years, amassing a portfolio of 40 rental properties with a total of 4,000 apartments. It has now begun building new apartment complexes, with almost 300 units either completed or under construction and another 411 in the planning stages.</p>
        <p>Its first new project, the 169-unit Fairfield Hills in Farmingville, opened last summer.  Like the AvalonBay projects and the Trammell Crow development, it offers a choice of apartments to suit different groups of renters. Sizes range from a 1,207-square-foot one-bedroom flat renting for $1,485 to a 1,575-square-foot three-bedroom two-story town house renting for $1,835. There is a 7,000-square-foot clubhouse with a fitness and business center, a pool, a playground and courts for tennis, volleyball and basketball. The complex is fully rented and has a waiting list.</p>
        <p>Last month, Fairfield began leasing its newest project, Setauket Gables, and it took  deposits on 37 of the 64 apartments on opening day, said Mark A. Broxmeyer, one of the principals in Fairfield. The Setauket development has five floor plans; a 1,150-square-foot one-bedroom with a loft rents for $1,750, a 1,195-square-foot two-bedroom for $2,000 and a 1,150-square-foot three-bedroom for $2,200. Each apartment has direct access to a private garage. Of the 64 apartments, 28 are town houses, and a third of the apartments have fireplaces. There is a clubhouse with a fitness and business center, a pool and an electronic gatehouse.</p>
        <p>''Many of our tenants have combined incomes of $150,000 or more,'' Mr. Broxmeyer said. ''They have chosen to rent because they don't want to worry about maintenance. They're retired, or they work long hours, and they just want to turn the key in the door and be done.''</p>
        <p>Fairfield's third project, which has not yet been named, is under construction in the Village of Port Jefferson. It will have 66 apartments. Another complex with 202 apartments will start construction this summer across the street from Fairfield Hills, and yet another, for people 55 and over, is planned for Port Jefferson.</p>
        <p>Ross C. Cassata of Babylon, who with a partner, Glenn D. Feldman, is building a 402-apartment rental complex in Holtsville called Victorian Gardens, said the 300 apartments completed there so far are all rented.  Rents range from $1,250 for a 1,000-square-foot one-bedroom to $1,450 for a 1,200-square-foot two-bedroom. Mr. Cassata said he has three more projects with a total of  800 apartments in the planning stages. All three will be for people 55 and over.</p>
        <p>Demand for these rentals is so strong, Mr. Cassata said, that ''we paint our apartments in the morning, and by afternoon people are already moving in.''</p>
