        <p>Legacy of a Kidnapping: Lindbergh and the Triumph of the Tabloids, by Harper's Magazine editor Lewis H Lapham, about development of sensational journalism, will be broadcast by Long Island-based WLIR public television station; photo (By the Way column) (S)</p>

        <p>The tabloid headlines didn't begin their screaming with O. J., Diana, the Princess of Wales, and Eli'an. A very New Jersey event, the Lindbergh kidnapping trial in Flemington in 1935, gave the tabloid press the chance to flex its muscles, aided by high-speed printing, improved telephone service and flashbulb photography. With the addition of national radio networks, celebrity -- and infamy -- could explode into the American consciousness. In ''Legacy of a Kidnapping: Lindbergh and the Triumph of the Tabloids,'' Lewis H. Lapham, editor of Harper's magazine, presents a documentary essay that uses the trial to connect the sensational journalism displayed in Flemington with the coverage of today, comparing Walter Winchell with Peter Jennings, the ''Sob Sisters'' of the Hearst machine with Diane Sawyer and Barbara Walters. The program will be broadcast Tuesday at 9 p.m. on WLIW, the public television station based on Long Island.</p>
