        <p>Randy Velarde, the Oakland Athletics' second baseman, became the 11th player in major league baseball history to turn in an unassisted triple play. With none out and runners on first and second, the Athletics' opponents, the Yankees, tried a double steal. Velarde went to cover second base. Shane Spencer hit a line drive up the middle right to Velarde, who tagged out Jorge Posada as he ran from first and then stepped on second base to force out Tino Martinez. Three outs in less than three seconds. ''You have a better chance of getting struck by lightning,'' Velarde said afterward.</p>
