        <p>Steve Lowery survived an eventful back nine yesterday, saving par twice from ugly spots in the rough, to cling to a one-stroke lead in the Kemper Insurance Open in Potomac, Md.</p>
        <p>Lowery, seeking his first PGA Tour victory in six years, shot a 1-under-par 70 for a three-round total of 202 - 11 under par. Franklin Langham and Paul Stankowski were a stroke back, with Tom Scherrer and Justin Leonard were two off the lead.</p>
        <p>''Anything's possible,'' Stankowski said. ''Someone could shoot 63 in a heartbeat here tomorrow and come from behind.''</p>
        <p>The weather was cooler and comfortable after a humid Friday. Low scores were routine -- except from the four golfers who led the field after the second round. Leonard managed a par 71 in front of a poor-behaving gallery.</p>
        <p>Spectators routinely walked off before Lowery putted, and he was distracted by noisy sunbathers at the 7th. Leonard had to back off a putt at the 18th and pointed at someone in the gallery. He then approached the gallery and spoke to the distracting spectator before walking off the green.</p>
        <p>''There's going to be some people making noise and some people who maybe forget there's a tournament going on,'' Leonard said.</p>
        <p>PLAYER SHARES THE LEAD: For all that Gary Player has done on a golf course, one goal remains. If he can get his putter going Sunday, he just might become the first person to win a tournament in six decades.</p>
        <p>''That's the only ambition I have left in golf, if it's possible to achieve,'' Player said after shooting a 3-under-par 69 for a share of the lead in the BellSouth Senior Classic.</p>
        <p>No one has won a PGA Tour-sanctioned event in six decades. Player won his first in 1958 and used the senior tour to help him join Sam Snead as the only golfers to win in five decades.</p>
        <p>He shares the lead with Hale Irwin, Vicente Fernandez and Tom Kite, who turned in a 63 yesterday.</p>
        <p>PARK MAINTAINS LEAD: South Korea's Grace Park shot a 2-under-par 70 yesterday to maintain a one-stroke lead after the third round of the Kathy Ireland Greens.com Classic.</p>
        <p>Park, the 21-year-old former Arizona State star in her first season on the LPGA tour, had a 12-under 204 total on Wachesaw Plantation's East course.</p>
        <p>''I like where I am and I don't feel any pressure,'' Park said. ''I guess I have been in this position before, just not here on the LPGA Tour.''</p>
        <p>Juli Inkster and Pat Hurst shot 68s to share second place at 205.</p>
        <p>HOWELL LEADS OKLAHOMA STATE TO TITLE: Charles Howell all but took care of the individual title in the first nine holes.</p>
        <p>That left only one piece of unfinished business for the Oklahoma State junior -- winning the team title. Howell and the Cowboys turned in record-setting performances then won the NCAA Championship in a one-hole playoff with Georgia Tech on Saturday.</p>
        <p>''I wanted to do this as an individual, but it wouldn't have meant half as much if the team didn't win it,'' said Howell.</p>
        <p>''When I looked at the leaderboard after nine holes, I totally forgot about the individual thing.''</p>
        <p>It was the Cowboys' ninth team title and first since 1995.</p>
