        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As the disputes about the Tony Awards heat up, I have some ideas to offer. First, everyone should remember that these awards are about theater. Not about films or television.</p>
        <p>The awards show should always be held in a real Broadway theater, the more historic the better. The show's host should always be a true theater person, not some show-biz groupie like Rosie O'Donnell, who, even though a rabid supporter of the ''theater,'' shouldn't be in the same room with real theater people.</p>

        <p>The real television home for this show is on PBS, no commercials, just theater and theater people. Short coherent scenes from the nominated plays deserve a showing. Let the directors and producers select them and air them, as well as the musical numbers, which are always highlighted.</p>
        <p>Keep the entire proceedings grown-up, intelligent, fun and indicative of the finest the theater has to offer. Just save us from the likes of Rosie O'Donnell.</p>
