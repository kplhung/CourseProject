        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a May 28 Week in Review article points out, Israel is rethinking its history. The new ''post-Zionism'' asserts that Israel is at best morally equivalent to its Arab antagonists. Indeed, the liberal establishment is teaching Israeli youth that the country's founders were colonialists who subjugated the Arabs and drove them from their homeland. Post-Zionists want to eliminate the Jewish character of the state and create a ''modern,'' secular, multicultural society.</p>

        <p>If revisionism is succeeding, there is no longer any reason for Jewish parents to raise a child in Israel who may perish in a war with Israel's enemies. The only rational behavior is to move to New York or Boston, and live a peaceful and prosperous life.</p>
