        <p>SOME months back, I took my 2 1/2-year-old son to the pediatrician for a checkup and got some unexpected news: he had shrunk half an inch from his previous visit.</p>
        <p>No cause for alarm here. The explanation was simple enough: for the first time, Clement had been measured standing up, not lying down fidgeting on the crinkly paper that covered the examination table. With this one giant leap into toddlerhood, he had, paradoxically, shrunk a bit in stature.</p>
        <p>No big deal. Except that my son is already on the short end of the height spectrum -- something of a family trait, if truth be told -- and he could really use that half inch.</p>
        <p>So in the admittedly unlikely event that the question of size comes up among his pals as they tool around the sandbox, I will not be surprised if he lies, reclaiming that stolen half inch and maybe even adding on another for good measure.</p>
        <p>After all, Clement would be in a good company. A study appearing this month in the American Statistical Association Proceedings reports that many Americans appear to lie about their height. Not weight or age, though they lie about that, too. Height.</p>
        <p>How do we know this?</p>
        <p>Because researchers at St. Louis University were curious about the accuracy of the self-reported data used in many health studies and decided to do a little comparison. The term refers to personal information gathered from people who volunteer it to researchers without benefit of physical exams. If the data is inaccurate, the results of the surveys can be skewed.</p>
        <p>William D. Hart, the nutrition and dietetics professor who led the study, compared the heights and weights reported by subjects in one survey with figures from  another in which people were examined. He and his colleagues took self-reported data offered by more than 6,000 people who participated in the National Health Interview Surveys from 1988 to 1994, and put them up against actual measurements from the more than 500,000 people examined in the National Health and Nutrition Examination.</p>
        <p>The researchers found that many people fudged their weight -- not a complete surprise. But they were not prepared for the number of people who seem to have volunteered inaccurate information about their height.</p>
        <p>From ages 20 to 84, men and women exaggerated. Indeed, more people were inclined to overstate their height than to understate their weight.</p>
        <p>For health experts, the main cause of concern is not the prevarication itself but something perhaps more serious. If the researchers are right, Americans, already among the most obese people in the world, could be in worse shape than previously thought.</p>
        <p>The researchers did not offer any theories for the misrepresentation. ''Psychosocial explanations can be postulated, but not confirmed with this data,'' they wrote.</p>
        <p>You don't need a psychosociologist, however, to understand why Americans would want to be taller. Height is often equated with power, wealth and even intelligence, said Jennifer F. Taylor, a clinical psychologist at Harvard University's McLean Hospital. ''It's something that's culturally ingrained from very early on,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Just consider the sight of two schoolchildren, back to back, trying to see who is taller -- with one or both sneaking onto tiptoes. Even in politics, presidential candidates who are taller are often considered to have an edge over their opponents.</p>
        <p>Where psychosociology might come in handy is in explaining why people would believe they could get away with lying about height. If you decide to shave 10 pounds off your weight, who can be sure? If you say you're five years younger, who is going to argue?</p>
        <p>But asking others to believe you are a couple of inches taller than you are, when they need only compare your stature with theirs, is another matter entirely. It requires not just an absence of skepticism on their part but actual complicity. It's the kind of thing that could happen only if everybody were lying about height.</p>
        <p>Of course, another explanation is that many people don't really know their own height, some experts say. There are few occasions in adulthood when it is taken.  And in the end, it may simply be that people are engaging not so much in deceit as in wishful thinking.</p>
        <p>Consider: My position is that I am 5 feet 4 inches. My wife labors under the mistaken impression that she is 5 feet 4 1/2 inches -- which is physically impossible, of course, because she is about two inches taller than I am. (Want more proof she's wrong? The other day, after I told him how tall I was, my brother declared that he was 5 feet 5. And yet he is shorter than my wife.)</p>
        <p>Of course, lying is such an ugly word. It is true that the last time I was measured by a doctor, my height was not recorded as 5 feet 4. But maybe they got it wrong. It would not be surprising, since they measured me when I was standing up.</p>
