        <p>DURING this brief June tomfoolery, interleague ball brings out a few interesting matchups, but mostly meetings between strangers that strike no sparks.</p>
        <p>If there is any value to interleague ball, it is the forcing of American League teams to play the real game, just for old time's sake.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the strip miners of the game continue to renew the same few meaningful rivalries every year, and let everybody else fend for himself.</p>
        <p>''I'm not so sure we need the Mets and Yankees every year,'' said Joe Torre, who has managed both, as well as the Braves.</p>
        <p>There is the obvious Los Angeles-Anaheim freeway series and the obvious Oakland-San Francisco series. (But did they cross the bay in a ferry the way they did when Casey Stengel managed the Oakland Oaks in the Pacific Coast League? No, doctor.)</p>
        <p>Baseball gives the hinterlands the leftovers, but panders to the big-time teams. The rich get richer, Part 87.</p>
        <p>The Braves and the Yankees are a natural. This weekend they resumed where they left off last October with new plot lines that include John Rocker, the pitcher who hates people who are different from folks in his corner of Macon, Ga.</p>
        <p>There was Rocker, his control and career in big trouble, loading the bases before Shane Spencer hit a long out to the left-field wall, as the Braves held off the Yankees, 11-7, and everybody understood what Greg Maddux of the Braves meant when he said, ''We needed to beat these guys here.''</p>
        <p>These two rivals made interleague ball almost legitimate.</p>
        <p>''You can't argue with this,'' said Bobby Cox, the manager of the Braves, staring up at the packed house of 48,524 on Friday night.</p>
        <p>Normally a critic of interleague ball, Cox knows the ring of turnstiles when he hears it. But tell that to Montreal, where exactly 12,654 fans paid their way on Friday to see the dashing Expos torment the Orioles.</p>
        <p>Cox took off yesterday to attend his daughter's high school graduation, the right thing to do. His backup, Pat Corrales, showed proper National League mental stimulation. Needing some runs in the fifth inning, Corrales revved up Javier Lopez, the regular catcher who was allegedly having an afternoon off.</p>
        <p>Lopez drove in one run with a double and then, properly warmed up, drove in the tying and go-ahead runs with another double in the seventh. This flexibility by manager and players happens more often in the National League, with its wild-card factor of a pitcher in the batting order.</p>
        <p>When the two leagues meet on National League soil, there is a great cranking of gears as managers adjust to the rules: American League games have the designated hitter; National League games have strategy.</p>
        <p>''You have to be on your toes,'' said Torre, who is just that.</p>
        <p>On Friday night, Torre pulled that old National League ploy, the double-switch, bringing in a fielder and a pitcher at the very same time, and hiding the pitcher down in the batting rotation. In other words, the machination that Bobby Valentine of the Mets likes to pull six or eight times a game.</p>
        <p>''Actually, Zim reminded me to tell the umpire first,'' Torre said of bench coach Don Zimmer. ''Not that it's really necessary, but you just do it that way.''</p>
        <p>Torre confessed that he frets when he sees pitchers picking up those wooden sticks. So much can go wrong. A pitcher can take one on the fingers while trying to bunt. (Happened to David Cone as a Mets rookie.) A pitcher can pull a muscle while practicing his bunting. (Happened to Orlando Hernandez last week.)</p>
        <p>''I would just as soon have El Duque take three pitches and sit down,'' Torre admitted. ''But he wanted to knock in the runs, even though I know it's very remote.''</p>
        <p>There is the old National League tradition that the pitcher can, occasionally, be an athlete. Yesterday  there was Maddux, moving within one of the record for putouts by a pitcher -- 387 by Jack Morris, but you already knew that -- by hustling over to first on a grounder. Maddux also ran the bases twice, once on an error, once on a walk after whacking four or five fouls off his fellow Cy Young multiple winner, Roger Clemens.</p>
        <p>There were so many twists and turns, plot revisions, mood shifts, that it consumed some time.</p>
        <p>''I know I've been in the game too long when I sit in the dugout and think, 'Hey, this game is pretty fast' and it's three hours,'' Torre said.</p>
        <p>This one took 3 hours 57 minutes, and nobody in Turner Field had any illusion about this game moving right along. But at least it was exciting, prompted by National League rules -- the human side of inter league ball.</p>
