        <p>GLEN A. Kleczka, 37, the lead manager of the $58.0 million William Blair Value Discovery fund, admits to being a foodie, but he rarely finds time to cook at home in Chicago.</p>
        <p>''Managing the portfolio and servicing clients doesn't leave me a lot of time,'' said Mr. Kleczka (pronounced Klehch-kah). ''So I tend to eat better when I travel.''</p>
        <p>Luckily, running the fund requires extensive travel as Mr. Kleczka checks in with the management of companies in whose stock he is interested. And if Mr. Kleczka puts on a few pounds as a result, well, his shareholders at least are the better for it. William Blair Value Discovery returned 11.8 percent a year, annualized, for the three years through May 31, compared with 4.8 percent for its small value peers, according to Morningstar Inc.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kleczka credits the fund's value philosophy, which he describes with great simplicity. ''We buy broken stocks,'' he said, ''not broken companies.''</p>
        <p>A ''broken stock'' typically trades at 50 percent or so off its five-year-high stock price. Its valuation -- Mr. Kleczka typically compares a stock's current price to its three-year forward earnings potential -- is depressed, he said.</p>
        <p>But a company that is not ''broken'' often has several other attributes: leading market share, improving profitability, and management that is purchasing shares or initiating share buyback plans. Mr. Kleczka tries to find stocks that will rise 15 to 20 percent annually over three years and whose earnings will rise 12 to 20 percent annually.</p>
        <p>''These are not supercharged topline growth companies,'' he said. ''We'd rather see slower growers with improvements in profitability and expanding profit margins.''</p>
        <p>Each month, Mr. Kleczka screens 11,000 stocks with market capitalizations below $1.5 billion. Expensive companies are excised from the list using a variety of valuation measures, such as a companies' cash to share price, which he generally likes to see as high as possible. He also discards those that trade for more than twice their tangible book value, that is, book value excluding goodwill and other intangibles. That leaves him with some 750 companies.</p>
        <p>Next, he and the fund's two co-managers, David S. Mitchell and Cappy E. Price, investigate the remaining candidates. By reading company reports, filings and Wall Street research, they are generally able to find sufficient cause to eliminate 550 more companies.</p>
        <p>Finally, they visit companies to evaluate management and seek clues to the company's improving prospects. Mr. Kleczka figures he spends about 40 to 50 percent of his time on the road and talks to more than 100 companies each year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kleczka and his co-managers each prepare four-page investment theses for these stocks and exchange them with their colleagues. In biweekly meetings, they debate possible purchases, which they make only when they reach a consensus.</p>
        <p>The fund holds 50 to 70 stocks and, because it seeks to offset gains with losses, distributed no capital gains in 1998 and 1999. A small distribution is expected this year.</p>
        <p>These days, the fund is focusing on capital goods companies and other firms in the industrial economy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kleczka owns shares of Landstar System, a national trucking firm in Jacksonville, Fla., whose truck drivers operate as independent contractors. They own their trucks and pay all expenses, turning over a small portion of their revenues to Landstar. ''That business model is very attractive because it reduces capital costs and eliminates price increases, especially in diesel fuels,'' he said. The company also generates a lot of free cash flow, which it uses to buy back shares.</p>
        <p>He bought shares in January 1997 for $24 each, 40 percent below their five year highs after the company had difficulties integrating several acquisitions. Profitability has since improved, he said, and it is using the Internet to reduce costs.</p>
        <p>''The company has consistently exceeded rising earnings expectations in the last two years,'' Mr. Kleczka said, ''and we'll continue to see that.'' Shares closed Friday at $53.25, or between 10.2 and 9.7 times his 2000 per-share earnings estimate of $5.20 to $5.47. His 12-month price target is $63.</p>
        <p>He also likes Arch Chemicals, of Norwalk, Conn., which manufactures and markets chemicals used in the microelectronics and water industries. He bought shares in November for an average price of $15.50, after the price had fallen about 40 percent following Arch's spin off from Olin Chemicals in February 1999. ''It's extremely cheap,'' Mr. Kleczka said, ''and historically, spinoffs tend to outperform.''</p>
        <p>ARCH plans to sell a low-margin water chemical distribution business, which should increase its overall profitability, he said, and plans a venture with an industrial gas company to run its semiconductor chemicals business more efficiently. Shares closed Friday at $18.25, or 8.9 times his earnings estimate of $2.05 this year. He forecasts a three-year annual earnings growth rate of 12 to 15 percent and has a 12-month price target of $24.</p>
        <p>Another favorite: Overland Data, in San Diego, which makes magnetic tape data storage systems used by big businesses to back up their enterprise-wide servers. He bought shares for $10 at the February 1997 initial offering and added more the next year, as the price fell to $4. Overland has $14 million in cash on its balance sheet, (about 20 percent of its stock price), and no long-term debt, Mr. Kleczka said.</p>
        <p>Its earnings have been flat, he said, because money has been reinvested in the business. At year-end 1999, it became an exclusive original equipment manufacturer for Compaq Computer, which has one of the largest installed server bases in the world. That will create economies of scale and should help Overland increase its operating margins to 9 percent over the next two years, from 5 percent now, he said.</p>
        <p>Shares closed Friday at $9.875, or 15.2 to 13.2 times his June 2001 per-share earnings estimate of 65 cents to 75 cents. His 12-month price target is $12 to $15.</p>
