        <p>Q.: My husband and son are very interested in airplanes and I thought it might be a good idea for their birthdays to find an airline that had a flight simulator open to the public. Can you help? -- Caryn Heaven, Woodmere, N.Y.</p>
        <p>A.: Time on most airlines' flight simulators is usually tied up, quite naturally, for the training of real pilots. But, assuming availability, United can put your husband and son at the controls of one of its 36 simulators in Denver any day of the year except Christmas and New Year's.</p>

        <p>Q.: My husband and son are very interested in airplanes and I thought it might be a good idea for their birthdays to find an airline that had a flight simulator open to the public. Can you help? -- Caryn Heaven, Woodmere, N.Y.</p>
        <p>A.: Time on most airlines' flight simulators is usually tied up, quite naturally, for the training of real pilots. But, assuming availability, United can put your husband and son at the controls of one of its 36 simulators in Denver any day of the year except Christmas and New Year's.</p>
        <p>Delta also has simulators available, but only rarely. Rather than charging a fee, it conducts an auction, with the prize going to the two people who bid the highest number of frequent-flier miles. The next auction is expected to be late this summer; the last was held in April 1999.</p>
        <p>Participants in the United Airlines program get time at the stick in actual aircraft cockpits mounted on huge motion systems that require a three-story building to accommodate movement up and down. They are guided through actual flight scenarios -- takeoffs, landings and possibly emergencies -- and view realistic representations of cities and their airports from the air.</p>
        <p>The price is determined by the aircraft and level of orientation (bronze, silver or gold). The bronze level offers an hour of ground school, an hour of simulator time and a 30-minute debriefing; silver offers the same elements plus a tour of United's training center; and gold provides a second hour on a flight simulator in addition to all of the above.</p>
        <p>United recommends but does not require that two or three people make up a crew, which divides the cost. The least expensive simulator is for the Boeing 737-200 ($650 for bronze to $1,150 for gold); the most expensive is for the Boeing 777 ($1,200 to $1,750).</p>
        <p>These prices do not include air fare, but United can arrange for participants to get a reduced hotel rate: from $38 at the Super 8 to $82 at the Renaissance, for single or double occupancy, plus tax.</p>
        <p>For information, get in touch with Dawn Thompson at the United Training Center, 7401 Martin Luther King Boulevard, Mail Stop DENUS, Denver, Colo. 80207; (303) 780-3627, fax (303) 780-5828. Send e-mail messages to dawn.k.thompson@ual.com.</p>
        <p>The two highest bidders in the Delta Air Lines auction are awarded not only the flight simulation for themselves (and up to three guests) but also air fare to Atlanta, two nights' accommodations at the Crowne Plaza and car rental. For details, keep an eye on www.delta-air.com.</p>
        <p>Cricket in London</p>
        <p>Q.: Our family will be traveling to London in July and I have promised our 13-year-old son that we would try to see at least one rugby, soccer or cricket match. How can we get schedules? And can we buy tickets in advance? -- M. D., Bloomington, Ind.</p>
        <p>A.: Of the three sports you mention, cricket is the only one played professionally in England in July. The tickets most in demand are for international matches. In London, they are played at Lord's Cricket Ground, in the district of St. John's Wood, and the Foster's Oval, in the district of Kennington, in South London. Games usually start at 11 a.m. and end at 6.</p>
        <p>Should those tickets be sold out by the time you call, don't despair: Tickets for county-level games in the London area should be no problem at all to get. (Half price for under 16.)</p>
        <p>First, a look at ticket availability for international matches as of late May:</p>
        <p>July 2: In the fourth day of a five-day match, England will play the West Indies at Lord's. Tickets: $35.45 to $56.15, at the rate of 68 pence to the dollar.</p>
        <p>July 8: England vs. Zimbabwe at the Oval; $52.75 to $66.45.</p>
        <p>July 22: Of three teams -- England, West Indies and Zimbabwe -- the two best compete in a final game, at Lord's; $50.20 and $68.</p>
        <p>July 29: In a fund-raising event at the Oval, Asia (meaning players primarily from Pakistan and India) will play a team of players from rest of the world; $22.15 to $36.90.</p>
        <p>For tickets, call the official England and Wales Cricket Board ticket line at (44-990) 338833 or order online at www.lords.org, where you will also find a schedule. If you have a specific date in mind, click on ''Fixtures,'' then on the month and day.</p>
        <p>Tickets for international matches at Lord's and the Oval can be charged to a credit card and picked up at the box office. The booking fee is $3.70 an order at Lord's and 75 cents a ticket at the Oval.</p>
        <p>The two county-level cricket clubs in London are Middlesex and Surrey, and getting a ticket for either should be a snap. Middlesex will play at the Southgate grounds in London on July 7 to 10, 12 to 15, 16, 28 to 31. Surrey will play at the Oval on July 7 to 10, 12 to 15 and 16. (In a one-day game such as the one on the 16th, the results are known at day's end.) Both teams may play added games in July if they do well in preceding games.</p>
        <p>Tickets for county-level teams are $17.70, $8.85 for those under 16. To contact Middlesex (based at Lord's), call (44-207) 289 1300 and Surrey (based at the Oval), (44-207) 582 6660; The nearest Underground stops for cricket grounds are these: for Lord's, St. John's Wood on the Jubilee Line; for the Oval, the Oval on the Northern Line, and for Southgate, Southgate on the Piccadilly Line.</p>
        <p>Wheelchairs at Gardens</p>
        <p>Q.: Are there any botanical gardens in New York City with full access to people in wheelchairs? -- places not made inaccessible by steps or gravel walkways? -- Vicki Meagher, Nashua, N.H.</p>
        <p>A.: Actually, most of the gardens are fully accessible. In fact, late last month the Japanese Hill-and-Pond Garden at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden reopened to the public after an 11-month renovation that included making paths wider, smoother and free of barriers. Closed every Monday; (718) 623-7200.</p>
        <p>Other choices are these:</p>
        <p>The New York Botanical Garden, with 250 acres of grounds in the Bronx, including a 40-acre forest. Closed Mondays, but open on Monday holidays; (718) 817-8700.</p>
        <p>Queens Botanical Garden, in Flushing, with 18 acres of formal gardens and a 21-acre arboretum. Closed Mondays, but open on Monday holidays; (718) 886-3800.</p>
        <p>Staten Island Botanical Garden, in Snug Harbor on Kill van Kull, is wheelchair-accessible except for a 10- to 15-foot stretch of the Chinese Scholar's Garden. That garden and the Secret Garden are closed on Monday, but all the other areas are open daily; (718) 273-8200.</p>
