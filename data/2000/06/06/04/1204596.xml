        <p>OFFICIALS at Sarah Lawrence College are happy to be in two very different places at the same time.</p>
        <p>Bronxville -- the quaint and wealthy village -- is where potential students send their applications for enrollment, and Yonkers -- the gritty blue-collar city -- is where the college sends its applications for development aid.</p>
        <p>The college's latest request to the city's Industrial Development Agency, whose board is headed by Mayor John D. Spencer, was for permission to issue up to $22 million in industrial development bonds for renovations and purchases.</p>
        <p>Sarah Lawrence wants to repair roofs and install sprinklers, build more space for its students and administrators and, in what can only be described as its centerpiece pursuit, buy the six-story building at 1225 Midland Avenue, adjacent to the campus, and use its 87 apartments as dorm rooms for undergraduate students.</p>
        <p>Anyone now living there will be allowed to stay, city and college officials said.</p>
        <p>The agency has approved the deal, but none of the tax-exempt bonds have yet been sold, though the first $7 million worth could be issued in the next few weeks, said Dennis Cross, the college's vice president of finance and planning. Under the current plans, the rest will be sold next year.</p>
        <p>Edward A. Sheeran, the executive director of the Industrial Development Agency, said he is not frustrated by the fact that Sarah Lawrence must use a Bronxville zip code -- 10708 -- though it physically lies in the city of Yonkers and would pay taxes to the city -- if it had to pay taxes. He said he feels proud that the college is in Yonkers and wishes the city had more educational institutions like it.</p>
        <p>''In their marketing material their post office is Bronxville, there is no question about that,'' Mr. Sheeran said. ''On their application to us they utilize the Yonkers address.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cross said it is a coincidence that the college exists in the small portion of the eastern part of the city that is covered by the Bronxville postal address. He said Sarah Lawrence is ''not trying to hide or pretend we are not in Yonkers.''</p>
        <p>A college spokeswoman, Georgia Pollak, said she believes there is a common misunderstanding that somehow the college wants to be in Bronxville. In truth she said, the college wants to be part of both Bronxville and Yonkers because, in a larger sense, ''we straddle both communities.'' She called that an enviable position and had the president of the college call back to voice the same idea.</p>
        <p>''I think it is great to have two homes and not just one,'' said Michele Tolela Myers, who has been the president of Sarah Lawrence for two years and added that she is tired of the subject.</p>
        <p>Before she hung up, Ms. Myers said of the issue, ''I wish this would go away.''</p>
