        <p>At Weber State University in Ogden, Utah, the Honors Program sponsors a course called ''The Epistemology of Fly Fishing.'' The point of the class, says the school's syllabus, is to ''use fly fishing as a way to know the world, or at least as a window to explore biology, literature, gender, physics and environmental issues,'' as well as to teach students how to catch a fish with a fly.</p>
        <p>The class is heavily subscribed, mainly, it is thought, because of the Robert Redford-directed film of Norman Maclean's book, ''A River Runs Through It,'' set just to the north, in Montana. The book is required reading for the class.</p>

        <p>At Weber State University in Ogden, Utah, the Honors Program sponsors a course called ''The Epistemology of Fly Fishing.'' The point of the class, says the school's syllabus, is to ''use fly fishing as a way to know the world, or at least as a window to explore biology, literature, gender, physics and environmental issues,'' as well as to teach students how to catch a fish with a fly.</p>
        <p>The class is heavily subscribed, mainly, it is thought, because of the Robert Redford-directed film of Norman Maclean's book, ''A River Runs Through It,'' set just to the north, in Montana. The book is required reading for the class.</p>
        <p>As someone interested in both fishing and writing, I had the luck to be invited along on the class's climactic April field trip on the Green River, Utah's most famous blue-ribbon trout water. Last year, the guest was Peter Matthiessen. Next year, he will be Richard Ford.</p>
        <p>We arose at 5 a.m. and headed in a motor caravan for the Flaming Gorge Dam, in the northeast corner of the state, so called for the redness of the rock in the 750-foot-high banks of the gorge where the dam was built in 1963. We arrived at about 9, a party of 14 students (9 men and 5 women), two teachers (both men), two male friends of the teachers, along to help out and for their love of the sport, and me.</p>
        <p>We parked at Little Hole, some seven miles downriver from the dam. The teachers helped the students to rig up their outfits, reminded them of some of the basics of wading, and loosed them on the water, telling them to be back at the parking area by 5.</p>
        <p>Then four of us -- the two teachers, one of their friends and I -- drove up to the dam to fish the intervening length of the river in boats. The friend, Duane Allport, mounted his catamaran-style, single-seated pontoon boat and set off on his own.</p>
        <p>The remaining three of us boarded a Mackenzie drift boat, elevated in the bow to negotiate the rapids comfortably and beamy amidships to allow for excited jumping around, and weighed anchor. The point of this exercise was partly to test the possibility of taking the entire class drifting next year, but mostly to do just about the best kind of fishing there is.</p>
        <p>Dave Scadden, the class's technical expert, rowed. Dave is something of a legend in northern Utah, considered to be one of the most skilled outdoorsmen in the West. He began trapping furs and learning to live off the land as a boy. By his late teens, he had grown so expert that Redford used him as a consultant and a stand-in for his 1972 film on mountain men, ''Jeremiah Johnson.''</p>
        <p>Dave now owns four fishing-equipment outlets in the Salt Lake area, collectively called Angler's Inn, which runs a guiding service. He is also developing his own line of lightweight portable single- and double-hulled pontoon boats for fishing previously untouched waters. He was recently back from Siberia, where he had been hired by the Russians to show local guides how to fish the Sadanka River by boat.</p>
        <p>Craig J. Oberg, the chairman of Weber State's microbiology department and the fly-fishing class's main teacher, sat in the stern. Although he assumed the role of student to Dave, a neighbor and good friend of his, he proved a pretty handy angler himself. I got to fish from the seat in the raised bow.</p>
        <p>As we moved downstream, I had the illusion, perhaps because of the steepness of the bluffs on either side, that the river was tilted at a 10 degree angle downward, so that I was not only drifting over trout but also falling into them.</p>
        <p>Standing up in the bow with my legs braced comfortably against special notches, I could look down into the transparent pea-green water and watch pods of fish feeding near the surface and big loners cruising below. There had been talk of an abundant blue-winged-olive hatch to come at about noon and of the good odds of taking a 20 on a 20, meaning a 20-inch trout on a No. 20 hook. Needless to say, I was practically trembling in anticipation.</p>
        <p>But the feeding fish weren't breaking the surface hard that morning. Instead they were taking something just below and occasionally coming up to sip gently enough not to make any kind of splash.</p>
        <p>So Dave rigged up Craig and me with double flies set 18 inches apart on a 6X leader, a #16 parachute Adams dry fly up-line and a #20 BWO emerger at the end. I cast to a pod of three and held my breath as a husky fish investigated my lure.</p>
        <p>At a flash of white mouth, I snapped my rod back and was on to a 14-inch rainbow trout. He came to the net lazily and after unhooking and releasing him, we fell into a happy rhythm of catching and releasing fish, rainbows, cutthroats and cutbows, a hybrid of the two. For the first time, I understood what they mean by casting to the fish.</p>
        <p>After a while, Dave suggested we start casting to the edge of the river, where the stone cliffs ascended, and where, he assured us, bigger browns were feeding. He maneuvered the boat with his oars, and we started trying to place our casts within six inches of the bluff.</p>
        <p>But a problem developed. The fish would come up and take our flies visibly enough, but when we struck, there was nothing there. Time and again our lines would zing through the air embarrassingly.</p>
        <p>Eventually, Dave intervened. ''The fish are collecting multiple flies in their mouths before they go back down and swallow,'' he told us. ''So you have to wait before you try to set the hook. You have to watch the fish take the lure and then wait for a count of three before you strike. I know it goes against every instinct, but you've got to wait.''</p>
        <p>I cast again. I could barely see the dry fly floating on the water in the shadow.</p>
        <p>Dave said in a low voice: ''Here he comes. Wait. He's taking the emerger. Wait.''</p>
        <p>I saw the dry fly disappear beneath the surface, but held my rod tip still.</p>
        <p>Finally Dave said urgently, ''Now!!!'' I lifted my rod tip and after a good fight, we had an 18-inch brown in the boat.</p>
        <p>Craig congratulated me but added that it was too bad that now I would have to walk back to Ogden. A moment later, he landed his own 18-inch brown and he said that all was forgiven.</p>
        <p>We drifted on down the stream and lost ourselves in the dreamy heat of the day and the rhythm of the fishing. Duane came alongside and described the good fish he had caught.</p>
        <p>Eventually we arrived back at Little Hole. It was 5:30. As we loaded the boat onto Dave's trailer, Craig looked at his watch and snarled that any students back at the parking lot on time would flunk the course for lacking the proper time-oblivious enthusiasm.</p>
        <p>When we got to the rallying point, all the students and their supervisors were there, babbling happily about the fish they had caught. Dave strode into their midst, and announced that the lesson of the day was that the fish had been sipping multiple small flies before swallowing because they had to be compensated for the energy expended in chasing them. The students nodded attentively.</p>
        <p>Craig announced in his big voice that all of them had flunked for showing up back at the rendezvous on time. They obviously weren't true fishermen and women.</p>
        <p>The students looked too tired and happy to care.</p>
