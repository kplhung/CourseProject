        <p>PITCHED battles have been fought to keep St. James quaint, with much success. But in this historic unincorporated hamlet on Suffolk County's near North Shore, where the old coexists somewhat uneasily with the new and house styles cover a broad range, quaintness has its price.</p>
        <p>Few speak of the place without using the ''q'' word, or without referring to such historic treasures as the old St. James General Store, operating since 1857 on a shady byway a George Washington coin-toss from North Country Road.</p>
        <p>The two-lane North Country Road, originally an Indian trail and now a New York State Historic Corridor passing through the history- and landmark-rich downtown area of the village, winds today as it did in 1790 when Washington rode by in his fancy coach during his Long Island tour.</p>
        <p>The road also has another name, Route 25A, and the civic fights in the area often center on efforts to widen, straighten and increase traffic volume on it.</p>
        <p>''Any attempt to widen it would not be welcomed,'' said Michael J. Fitzpatrick, a St. James resident and member of the Town Board of Smithtown, which includes St. James. Yet by protecting its historic virtues and achieving a reputation as a leafy, folksy, somehow rural yet suburban community, St. James may have become a victim of its own success. Has St. James attracted so many quaintness-seekers that the rush to buy and build will overwhelm the very qualities that attracted them in the first place?</p>
        <p>The battle-hardened in St. James think not, but they sound a note of caution. ''You can really lose the flavor of the place if you aren't careful,'' said Pat Rohr, a clerk in a Gibson Girl costume at the St. James General Store, which is operated by Friends for Long Island's Heritage.</p>
        <p>St. James got its name in the mid-19th century, when residents, then mostly farmers, adopted the name of the local Episcopal  church, which still exists.</p>
        <p>Real estate brokers say the St. James housing market has not been be so supercharged since the mid-1980's. The greatest number of single-family homes was built between 1960, when St. James was still rural, and 1970.</p>
        <p>''Everything is so scarce,'' said Janet Williams, an owner of Arbour Homes and Properties in St. James. ''We have hundreds and hundreds of customers and not enough inventory to sell them. This is a really, really tough market. I just wish more people would get out there and sell their homes, but they're all staying.''</p>
        <p>The hamlet is particularly popular with people employed by high-tech companies on Long Island, brokers said. It is also near the Stony Brook campus of the State University of New York. Commuters to Manhattan face a 90-minute train ride, or they drive 15 minutes to the Ronkonkoma station for express trains, which make rush-hour runs in  just over an an hour.</p>
        <p>Proximity to Long Island Sound and to the wealthy and picturesque villages of Head of the Harbor and Nissequogue, with which St. James shares its history (and ZIP code),  add to St. James's appeal, Ms. Williams said.</p>
        <p>On the tree-lined streets of St. James, older colonials mix with newer ranches, Capes, cottages and contemporaries on half-  and quarter-acre lots. Smaller and often lower-priced houses are on small lots near Route 25A and on both sides of Lake Avenue, the main north-south road.</p>
        <p>Barbara F. Van Liew, the village historian of Head of the Harbor, said the narrow lots were laid out in grid patterns in the 1890's. ''The idea was to sell them to immigrants right off the boat,'' she said.</p>
        <p>THE Long Island Rail Road arrived in 1873, spurring fears that the area would be exploited by land speculators. Instead, the trains brought the rich, whose farms and mansions employed local people. The original station is now a historic landmark.</p>
        <p>Frank Franco, an associate broker at Century 21 Northern Shores, noted that St. James, which he referred to as an ''upper-end community,'' is unusual for its north-to-south orientation, a departure from the east-to-west pattern more common in Suffolk. A benefit, he said, is less through traffic.</p>
        <p>Prices for new houses begin at about $500,000, while homes selling below $200,000 are becoming rare. ''If you are extremely lucky, one will pop between $175,000 and $190,000, but they are few and far between,'' Ms. Williams said.</p>
        <p>Remaining greenswards are vanishing at a rapid clip. Concerns have been expressed that development may overtake the 326-acre Gyrodyne property, a former helicopter plant that is now a small-business center with large open areas in the northeastern corner of St. James.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere, houses have been springing up in the small stands of woods here and there that give the hamlet its rural touch. A new development typical of St. James is Josephine Estates, with four center-hall colonials, priced from $529,999 to $600,000, on half-acre lots on Reagan Court, a cul-de-sac off Astor Avenue. Two of the houses, with taxes of about $15,000, are still for sale.</p>
        <p>Richard Hand, an agent at Marie Grant Realty Better Homes and Gardens in Smithtown, said the approvals for development of the three-acre parcel took about two years to obtain. He added that the houses were positioned to accommodate neighbors who wanted a wooded buffer zone.</p>
        <p>There is only one rental apartment complex in St. James: 12 two-story brick buildings known as Stonehenge, with 96 apartments. Rents are $1,020 for a one-bedroom, $1,250 for a two-bedroom.</p>
        <p>At Fairfield, with 758 condominiums for people 55 and older, one-bedroom apartments sell for $150,000 to $160,000, and two-bedrooms for about $190,000. This is the only condominium development in St. James.</p>
        <p>Stores can be found on Lake Avenue, Route 25 and Route 25A. A regional shopping mall, Smith Haven, is southeast of the hamlet near the junction of Route 25 and Route 347. It has 160 stores and 1.35 million square feet of retail space. The department stores there are Macy's, Stern's, Sears and J. C. Penney.</p>
        <p>Olson Memorial Park on Moriches Road, also called Veterans Memorial Park, has tennis courts, a basketball court, a large playground and a ball field. Another ball field, another basketball court and more tennis courts can be found at Gaynor Park on Woodlawn Avenue near the railroad tracks.</p>
        <p>Although St. James is landlocked, three town beaches on the Long Island Sound are nearby, including Short Beach in the adjoining Village of Nissequogue. ''It only takes me five minutes to get down to Short Beach for the sunset on summer nights,'' said Mr. Fitzpatrick, the town board member, who bought a home in St. James in 1989. ''I am amazed we have something like that literally in our backyard.''</p>
        <p>The other two town beaches on the sound  are at the Long Beach and Schubert town parks farther east. Long Beach also has a marina, but the wait for a boat slip there is estimated at about 19 years.</p>
        <p>The Nissequogue River, popular for kayaking and canoeing, is to the west, where a new state park is being created at the former Kings Park Psychiatric Center, once a source of employment for St. James residents. Sunken Meadow State Park is also nearby, on the sound.</p>
        <p>St. James is in the 8,700-student Smithtown Central School District, one of the largest public school systems on Long Island. Dr. Ronald D. Valenti, the superintendent, said that 92 percent of graduates last year went on to college.</p>
        <p>He said that College Board scores this year averaged 525 in verbal and 555 in math. Both scores are substantially above the state average of 495 in verbal and 502 in math. The district offers a number of advanced-placement courses and prides itself on its music and performing arts programs.  All classrooms have computers, and there are computer labs in each of the district's eight elementary schools -- one in St. James -- and in its two middle schools and its high school with a separate freshman campus.</p>
        <p>''The real story in this district is the dramatic growth,'' said Dr. Valenti, who said enrollment was expected to rise to 9,000 by September, up from 7,500 a decade ago. Enrollment at the St. James elementary school, with kindergarten through the fifth grade, is currently 725 but is expected to rise to 800 within a year or so.</p>
        <p>RESIDENTS of the district will vote June 15 on $126 million in bonds to  provide financing for a second high school, a third middle school and additional elementary school classrooms.</p>
        <p>A Roman Catholic elementary school, the St. Philip and St. James Parish School, has 410 students in the nursery through the eighth grade. Spanish, music and computer instruction begin in kindergarten, and band  in the fourth grade. Fees are $1,975 a year for grades one through eight, $1,600 for half-day kindergarten classes, $1,550 for 4-year-olds attending nursery school three days a week for two and a half hours, and $1,400 for 3-year-olds attending two days a week. Fees drop if more than one child in a family is enrolled; parents are required to make a $500 donation to their parish before enrolling a child.</p>
        <p>The Harbor Country School, a private school, has 144 students in kindergarten through the eighth grade, and 78 students in the prekindergarten and nursery programs. Tuition is $6,495 for kindergarten though the seventh grade and $5,795 for the eighth grade. The prekindergarten program costs $350 a month for five half days a week; the  nursery program is $265 a month for three half days and $190 a month for two half days.</p>
        <p>The school bond issue is indicative of just how much St. James and the surrounding area have grown in recent years. As recently as 1950, there were only 1,390 residents in St. James, and woods and farmland abounded; today, the population has swelled to  13,000 or so.</p>
        <p>''Now it's very much built up with all kinds of houses, from very modest to very attractive,'' said Mrs. Van Liew, the historian. ''There's not too many vacant lots left. It's certainly very different than it was 50 years ago.''</p>
