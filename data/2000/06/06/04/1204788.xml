        <p>AT first glance, the 30 percent growth in operating income that I.B.M. booked last year looks impressive.</p>
        <p>Closer inspection, though, shows that just under a third of the increase came from I.B.M.'s employee pension plan. The combination of a roaring stock market and lower costs associated with I.B.M.'s controversial switch to a new sort of pension plan generated $799 million in 1999. Accounting rules let such gains go into a company's income statement, although the company cannot spend the money for anything but pensions.</p>
        <p>Gains like these are doing more and more for corporate earnings. In 1996, pension fund growth amounted to just 1.8 percent of I.B.M.'s operating income. Last year, the pension contribution was 6.7 percent.</p>
        <p>Because these gains are typically buried in financial statements, shareholders may not understand how a company's earnings are augmented by pension gains.</p>
        <p>To highlight this and other financial reporting concerns, Lynn E. Turner, chief accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission, sent a letter to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants last December. Well before annual report season, Mr. Turner identified problem areas that could obscure a company's true financial picture. He warned auditors to be alert to the issues when preparing financial statements for their corporate clients.</p>
        <p>Mr. Turner's letter said that if a company changed its pension plan, or if the plan's gains or losses were likely to have a material impact on the company's financial condition, liquidity or results, the information should appear up front in the ''Management's Discussion and Analysis'' section of the annual report, not back in the footnotes.</p>
        <p>So why do the gains attributable to I.B.M.'s pension plan appear only in Footnote W?</p>
        <p>Jimmy Leas, an I.B.M. employee and shareholder, has been asking just that question. Last Thursday, Mr. Leas, an advisory engineer for I.B.M. in Burlington, Vt., queried Louis V. Gerstner Jr., I.B.M.'s chairman, about it by e-mail.</p>
        <p>By late Friday, Mr. Leas had not heard back. Asked by a reporter why the pension details were not in management's discussion and analysis, Carol Makovich, an I.B.M. spokeswoman, said, ''In terms of changes year to year, we don't believe it is quantitatively or qualitatively material.'' Ms. Makovich added that I.B.M.'s reporting is in strict compliance with accounting rules.</p>
        <p>To be sure, I.B.M. is just one of many companies that continues to bury details about its pension plans' gains. But Big Blue could be clearer. Though still in a footnote, General Electric -- was much more direct, for example. G.E.'s report made it obvious at a glance how much pension income contributed to operations.</p>
        <p>''I.B.M.'s annual report is one of the most complicated,'' said Brad Perry, former chairman and now consultant at David L. Babson &amp; Company, an investment advisory firm in Cambridge, Mass. ''Obfuscation is the name of the game, not just for I.B.M. but for a lot of companies.''</p>
        <p>Another area of I.B.M.'s financial report that is difficult to fathom concerns stock buybacks, which have totaled $14.2 billion in the past two years. By reducing the number of shares outstanding, the buybacks have helped I.B.M.'s per-share earnings grow at a respectable 10.5 percent -- masking the company's slow growth in revenue and income, Mr. Perry said.</p>
        <p>But the purchases come at a cost, he added: I.B.M.'s ratio of debt to total capital is 54 percent, up from 31 percent four years ago.</p>
        <p>''It's one thing to buy back shares if you have excess cash flow,'' Mr. Perry said, ''but when you're loading up the balance sheet with debt to jazz up your earnings, that's more suspect. And it certainly is a game that has an end.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps the S.E.C. will follow up its words with action. But shareholders should be vigilant for accounting gimmicks regardless. After all, not all earnings are equal.</p>
