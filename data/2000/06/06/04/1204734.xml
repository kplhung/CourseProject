        <p>THE SETTING -- Memorial Day, 2 p.m., on the 181st Street platform of the A train. A dozen friends and relatives helped Margery Cohen, an artist, attach 124 portraits to the blank spaces on the walls where advertisements used to be displayed. To keep things legal, Amy Melnick, a video teacher, captured the scene on a video camera: Ms. Cohen hadn't been able to get permission from the M.T.A. to install the exhibition, but she obtained a permit to film the installation of an exhibition.</p>
        <p>The drawings -- black Magic Markers on vinyl adhesive -- were variously funny (a clown in a football jersey), whimsical (a bunch of grapes with eyes) and odd (a woman with five noses). Riders exiting the train did double takes. Some heading downtown skipped the next train to see more.</p>

        <p>THE SETTING -- Memorial Day, 2 p.m., on the 181st Street platform of the A train. A dozen friends and relatives helped Margery Cohen, an artist, attach 124 portraits to the blank spaces on the walls where advertisements used to be displayed. To keep things legal, Amy Melnick, a video teacher, captured the scene on a video camera: Ms. Cohen hadn't been able to get permission from the M.T.A. to install the exhibition, but she obtained a permit to film the installation of an exhibition.</p>
        <p>The drawings -- black Magic Markers on vinyl adhesive -- were variously funny (a clown in a football jersey), whimsical (a bunch of grapes with eyes) and odd (a woman with five noses). Riders exiting the train did double takes. Some heading downtown skipped the next train to see more.</p>
        <p>THE BUZZ -- Ms. Cohen, who had spent $300 on the materials and worked full time on the project over several months, got the idea by staring at the empty black spaces at the station every day. ''I really like the idea that this isn't in a gallery,'' she said. ''It's accessible to everyone.''</p>
        <p>Her helpers, many of whom were artists themselves, commented on how well the exhibition fit into the decrepit station.</p>
        <p>''I love it,'' said Harvey Stein, a filmmaker from Little Italy. ''It's very primal. It's not only the making of the art, it's the tending of the space.''</p>
        <p>Transit riders, the unwitting first visitors to the exhibition, were also impressed. ''I think it's going to bring an optimistic, light feel to a black, sort of dingy, subway stop,'' said Adam Russell, a classical singer. ''I hope people don't write all over them.'' (Ms. Cohen plans to leave the portraits up for as long as they remain unharmed.)</p>
        <p>Some people couldn't place the art. ''It looks like Picasso a little,'' said a student from a local girls' school. ''I don't know. Van Gogh?''</p>
        <p>A distinguished-looking man contemplating the images turned out to be Philip Gould, a retired professor of art history who is a friend of Ms. Cohen's. He remarked on the ''bold style'' and ''free, broad'' execution.</p>
        <p>A more typical reaction was that of Felicita Molina, a local resident: ''It's really pretty. I wish they would do this in all the stations of Upper Manhattan.''</p>
        <p>Whenever a train stopped, passengers pointed and stared. One woman looked about in amazement, and it didn't take lip-reading skills to make out what she was saying: ''Wow!''</p>
