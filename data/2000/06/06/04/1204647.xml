        <p>Your Page 1 article on May 28 [''The Island's Nuclear-Tipped Past''] had a very large omission.</p>
        <p>There was another cold-war antiaircraft missile base, at Westhampton Air Force Base (now Gabreski Airport). This was a Bomarc missile installation operated by the United States Air Force. The name came from its developer, Boeing, and its work at the University of Michigan Aeronautical Research Center.</p>

        <p>There was another cold-war antiaircraft missile base, at Westhampton Air Force Base (now Gabreski Airport). This was a Bomarc missile installation operated by the United States Air Force. The name came from its developer, Boeing, and its work at the University of Michigan Aeronautical Research Center.</p>
        <p>The facility, which was built in a rush in the mid-50's, was also the home of Air Force jet fighters assigned to intercept Soviet bombers.</p>
        <p>The Bomarc was a winged, long-range antiaircraft missile armed with a thermonuclear warhead that could destroy whole formations of bombers with one shot. Collateral damage from this would be a story in itself.</p>
