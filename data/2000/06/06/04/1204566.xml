        <p>WE think of Emilio as we do old friends infrequently seen. Trusting the restaurant will always be there, we look for new places and tempting culinary innovation, while Emilio carries on as it has for 21 years, quietly freshening a little of this and rethinking a bit of that, waiting patiently for our return every few years.</p>
        <p>Our most recent visits have reminded us of the value of old friendships, their reliability and unquestioning hospitality. Service was impressive and so attentive that diners might be whisked past the antipasto table without having time to take in the splendid display of almost a dozen preparations, including avocado with crab meat, fresh sardines, tomato and bocconcini. We were delighted with a choice of cold lobster half piled high with chunky lobster salad, tender asparagus spears, leaves of endive spread with a roe mixture and yellow and red roasted peppers.</p>

        <p>WE think of Emilio as we do old friends infrequently seen. Trusting the restaurant will always be there, we look for new places and tempting culinary innovation, while Emilio carries on as it has for 21 years, quietly freshening a little of this and rethinking a bit of that, waiting patiently for our return every few years.</p>
        <p>Our most recent visits have reminded us of the value of old friendships, their reliability and unquestioning hospitality. Service was impressive and so attentive that diners might be whisked past the antipasto table without having time to take in the splendid display of almost a dozen preparations, including avocado with crab meat, fresh sardines, tomato and bocconcini. We were delighted with a choice of cold lobster half piled high with chunky lobster salad, tender asparagus spears, leaves of endive spread with a roe mixture and yellow and red roasted peppers.</p>
        <p>From the menu, a starter of small rock shrimp in salsa verde and a timbale of mushrooms came in as distant seconds, but avoid the ill-conceived match of good prosciutto and overly sharp and vinegar-soaked Granny Smith apple.</p>
        <p>Filled homemade pasta was Emilio's strong suit. Weightless ravioli (panzerotti) stuffed with Swiss chard were slathered with buttery walnut cream sauce; and translucent pillows of ravioli (called agnolotti on the menu) that burst with sweet squash were doused with herb butter. Cannelloni, one evening's special, was indeed that; drizzled with excellent Bolognese sauce and a dollop of bechamel, fresh pasta skin wrapped a harmonious forcemeat core of chicken, beef and spinach.</p>
        <p>Orecchiette with broccoli seemed clumsily composed, however: too light on broccoli and too heavy on olive oil, which swamped the bowl.  But with fettuccine pepperonato, the cook's taste buds failed, resulting in a poorly integrated dish -- sweet red and yellow peppers and small disks of fusty sausage contributing nothing cohesive to the mix.</p>
        <p>Simple, luscious poussin (a tiny chicken) arrived split, grilled and loaded with rosemary, an herb the kitchen favors as much as we do. Rosemary also enhanced thick-cut, satiny lamb chops. Unusual Marsala and orange sauce proved superb but could not tenderize two tough pork cutlets.</p>
        <p>Quite a few seafood selections were on hand. A hint of lemon brought up the clean flavor of a stout chunk of branzino, but juicy salmon, wrapped in parchment, was steamed with overwhelmingly acidic caponata, where a julienne of simple aromatic vegetables would have made subtler impact.</p>
        <p>Quite a few offerings paired inherently sweet scallops with another fish. Creamy lobster sauce added even more lavishness to sea scallops and succulent monkfish -- a fabulously rich-tasting dish. Equally delectable were sea scallops with swordfish. Bay scallops were the perfect size to be tossed with rock shrimp.</p>
        <p>A heavily laden dessert cart bore a pretty assortment of familiar creamy cakes and Italian pastry, but they were overshadowed by a few other offerings: spicy poached pear; flaky, not overly sweet apple strudel with vanilla ice cream; subtle lemon cream tart, the crust just a milligram too heavy for the dainty filling; and several kinds of plump berries. We prefer hazelnut gelato plain; here this ice cream came mixed with crumbs of chocolate biscotti, an intrusion on the wonderful flavor of  hazelnut.</p>
        <p>A three-course dinner averages $38 without drinks, tax and tip. Emilio is a block east and south of the Harrison train station.</p>
