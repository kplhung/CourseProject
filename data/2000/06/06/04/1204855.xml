        <p>When Prada Challenge of Italy advanced to last spring's America's Cup finals, the team's helmsman and leader, Francesco de Angelis, found himself at the center of a news media onslaught. Back home, the Prada crew members had become national heroes. But when asked how he handled the burden of his newfound celebrity, de Angelis shrugged and invoked the name of his country's most famous sailor.</p>
        <p>''I'm more popular in Italy now,'' he said. ''But I'm no Giovanni Soldini.''</p>
        <p>De Angelis was correct. Soldini -- a single-handed offshore virtuoso whose training regimen includes beer, cigarettes and pool halls -- is definitely one of a kind.</p>
        <p>Today, the bearded, diminutive, 34-year-old Soldini will be one of the favorites when the 10th running of the quadrennial single-handed trans-Atlantic race begins off Plymouth, England, bound for Newport, R.I. This year's event, which fields 71 boats and is sponsored by the Europe 1 radio group and New Man sportswear, is notable for its fleet of 19 Open 60's, the largest collection of those beamy, skittish downwind flyers ever assembled for a single race.</p>
        <p>Soldini's Fila is expected to be at or near the front of the pack. Is Soldini daunted by the prospect of facing French superstars like Yves Parlier, Marc Thiercelin and Catherine Chabaud, or the young English prodigy Ellen MacArthur? ''No,'' he said in a phone interview last week. ''I will do like always. I will sail my race.''</p>
        <p>In recent years, Soldini's long-distance adventures have run the spectrum from joyous to tragic. In the last Around Alone race, Soldini shook off a disastrous opening leg to claim a stirring, come-from-behind victory. Along the way he captured the world's attention by performing a stunning rescue of his fellow competitor Isabelle Autissier, who had capsized in the desolate reaches of the Southern Ocean.</p>
        <p>But in the prelude to that race, his best friend, the yacht designer Andrea Romanelli, was swept from Fila's decks in a North Atlantic storm, and lost at sea. After winning Around Alone, Soldini's first thoughts were of Romanelli. ''I wish he were here,'' he said. ''This boat was his life, too.''</p>
        <p>Soldini won Around Alone by sailing fast and intelligently, pushing hard when conditions were favorable, but easing back when the weather turned ugly. That old adage about solo marathon racing -- you must finish to win -- topped his list of priorities. But Soldini was lucky, too.</p>
        <p>At the midway point of the Around Alone race, Soldini was not the leader. That distinction belonged to the rugged English yachtsman Mike Golding, aboard Team Group 4. Golding is also competing in this year's single-handed trans-Atlantic race. And had it not been for a simple, awful mistake, the roles could have been reversed. Had it not been for an easily avoided sandbar, Golding, not Soldini, might be the reigning Around Alone champ.</p>
        <p>The winner of the first leg of the race, Golding was just 200 miles from duplicating the feat on Leg 2 when, on a crystal clear summer afternoon, he made a grave navigational error and furrowed into the shallows off New Zealand's Cape Reinga at the top of North Island, nearly ripping off his boat's deep canting keel. Golding survived the grounding, but was devastated when he realized he would be forced to withdraw. ''It's so sad,'' he had lamented. ''It's a shattered dream.''</p>
        <p>With the passage of time, however, the starch has returned to Golding's upper lip. ''It was unfortunate and even slightly unlucky,'' he said last week. ''Another day, if I'd been 100 yards to the right, it wouldn't have happened. But someone up there predetermined that I wasn't going to finish that race and so it was.</p>
        <p>''Every sailor hits bottom at some point and for me it was highly public,'' he said, finding the humor in his plight.</p>
        <p>Like Soldini and most of the other Open 60 sailors, he is using this event as a tune-up and qualifier for this fall's grueling Vendee Globe nonstop solo race round the world. And Golding also knows the trans-Atlantic race will be no laughing matter.</p>
        <p>''We have the potential for an extremely close, extremely good race,'' Golding said. ''I'm looking forward to getting stuck into it.''</p>
        <p>So too are the Americans Bruce Burgess aboard Hawaiian Express -- the only United States Open 60 in the field -- and Martin van Breems of Norwalk, Conn., sailing a J/44 called Monhegan. ''I can't wait to get out there and go sailing,'' said van Breems, one of five American entrants in the race.</p>
        <p>The forecast for the opening days of the 2,800-mile dash, depending on the route chosen, calls for moderate southwesterlies. The roster of competitors who Golding believes are dangerous holds few surprises. ''Clearly Giovanni,'' he said. ''He's very fast and very tough.''</p>
        <p>But when told that Golding and most everyone else was gunning for him, Soldini would not take the bait. ''There are many, many, many tough boats that could do well,'' he said. ''They are all very close.''</p>
        <p>Soldini would not name his rivals, but he would venture a guess on his arrival in Newport. ''Maybe in 14 days,'' he said. ''And 18 for the others. That would be nice, no?''</p>
