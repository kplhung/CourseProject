        <p>The facial pallor said everything. It had a reddish-pink hue to it, almost as if it belonged to a player rather than a coach -- as if Larry Bird had dropped all those 3-point bombs and gone for 34 points against the Knicks, instead of Reggie Miller.</p>
        <p>Almost an hour had passed since the Indiana Pacers made franchise history, but Bird's adrenaline was still coursing through his temples, like old times.</p>
        <p>If the Lakers could only take care of business against Portland, shoot, nostalgia was back in pro basketball. Bird's team against Magic's old team, for everything in the kitty. Again.</p>
        <p>''Listening to Magic coach that team out there for a while, we may have a shot at it,'' he said, laughing.</p>
        <p>Bird sat in the back of the training-room area, adjacent to the visitors' locker room at Madison Square Garden on Friday night. He had slung off his coat, unfastened his tie, unbuttoned the top button of his cream dress shirt and began to enjoy the solitude of a beer and another trip to the finals, his first since 1987.</p>
        <p>''Coaching is completely different than playing,'' he said. ''Playing is the ultimate. Having that ball in your hands, making plays, going on the road for a big playoff game. Winning. That's the ultimate. I'm just so happy for a lot of our older players, they finally get to play for a world championship.''</p>
        <p>His Midwestern drawl still makes world championship sound like ''wurld champeen-ship.''</p>
        <p>Over the past 20 years, the Hick from French Lick became Larry Legend, just as Larry Legend eventually morphed into Coach Bird. A little of each persona still remains.</p>
        <p>The broken English of a Southern Indiana small-town boy. The competitive drive of a Hall of Fame Celtic. And that helpless feeling on the bench, the feeling that no matter how much you want it, if your desire does not transfer to your players, the season is lost.</p>
        <p>When he took the Pacers' coaching job in 1997, Bird said: ''There's somethin' about this team I like. I can't quite put my finger on it.''</p>
        <p>It was plain to see, really. In so many ways, the Pacers were an extension of Bird. There were Miller's swagger and 3-point dagger. Mark Jackson's sleight of hand. Chris Mullin's craftiness, the way the veteran understood angles and trajectories the way only someone who had spent his life shooting alone in a dead-quiet gymnasium could. Dale Davis's tenacity. Jalen Rose's fearlessness.</p>
        <p>Slow of foot, blessed with skill, they were all pieces of Bird. So much of himself was in them.</p>
        <p>Everything, except his will. Because in the crucible moments -- in Game 6 against the Knicks last season and Game 7 against Chicago in 1998 -- it became painfully clear: they did not want to go to the finals as much as Larry Bird. He had watched the Pacers implode in the playoffs enough to build up a mounting frustration, a feeling that they were never going to summon the same resolve he had as a player.</p>
        <p>After their 0-2 Memorial Day weekend in New York, Bird spoke of his players with almost a rueful detachment, saying, ''That's the one thing that really kills me about 'em, that lack of a killer instinct.'' He added: ''When I went into a playoff game, I never thought I was going to lose. I just thought I'd win every game.''</p>
        <p>After the series was tied at two games apiece and sensing his team was going down, with his players questioning their roles and the system, Bird challenged them as he challenged his beleaguered Boston teammates after a playoff loss.</p>
        <p>''We need 12 heart transplants in this locker room,'' he had once said.</p>
        <p>It was almost as if the legend wanted to remain above the fray in case the coach failed, that he was not going to let this soft bunch of players toy with the Bird legacy.</p>
        <p>And at the moment he watched the Pacers nearly throw their season away again -- watched the rejuvenated Knicks open a 37-19 second-quarter lead before a fed-up, jeering crowd at Conseco Fieldhouse in Game 5 -- his perception about his team changed for good.</p>
        <p>''When we came back from that 18-point deficit in Game 5, I saw a different team,'' Bird said. ''I really did -- the best I've seen since I've been here. They fought, they scrapped. They finally believed in what we were trying to do here.</p>
        <p>''It was great to see. God, I've been so happy for 'em.''</p>
        <p>They parlayed that Game 5 comeback into a clinching Game 6 at the Garden. It was not only a victory that left Miller in the arms of Rose, pumping his bony, lethal wrist, but also a victory that left Bird beaming. By extension, the Pacers now had his heart. ''Thing is, in the first half we were moving the basketball so well,'' he said. ''It was unbelievable. All you can ask for is good looks at the basket. And we had 'em.''</p>
        <p>He thought for a moment and smiled. ''This poor franchise has been there five times or somethin' -- couldn't get through,'' Bird said. ''I'm so happy for 'em. I'm so happy for 'em.''</p>
        <p>On Friday night at the Garden, in big, ol' New York City, Larry Bird's team sprouted. Now they're going to play for a wurld champeen-ship.</p>
        <p>Who knows, they might just end up in L. A. -- where he and Magic last spun the world on their fingertips.</p>
        <p>''It's going to be great going back to the finals,'' Bird said. ''It's been . . . 13 years.''</p>
