        <p>Greg Maddux against Roger Clemens was supposed to be landmark. It turned out to be landfill.</p>
        <p>Clemens and Maddux couldn't get anybody out, the Yankees couldn't catch the ball, John Rocker couldn't throw strikes, and after watching the Yankees blow three separate leads and lose by 11-7, Manager Joe Torre couldn't take it anymore, blistering the shoddy performance in a team meeting.</p>
        <p>Minutes later, Torre's hat was cocked to the side of his head, his expression vacant. He had just watched 3 hours 57 minutes of atrocious baseball on a hot and muggy afternoon. He was tired and angry.</p>
        <p>Somebody asked Torre if he thought Shane Spencer's long fly ball with two outs in the ninth was going to carry over the wall for a game-tying grand slam. ''I don't know,'' Torre said. ''I saw so much today, I don't know what I was looking at.''</p>
        <p>Torre's postgame tirades are rare, and he was not specifically upset with the fact that the Yankees made four errors -- ''They're part of the game,'' he said -- or that Bernie Williams failed to catch a fly ball, or that the Yankees failed to score more runs and bury Maddux when they had the chance. Torre was mad because the Yankees had lost a game they should have won.</p>
        <p>''It was ugly,'' he said. ''I don't know any other way to describe it.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees had a small sense of relief because injuries that had forced two important players out of the game did not appear to be serious. Jorge Posada, the Yankees' catcher, sustained a bruised right knee after Maddux fouled a ball off the joint in the second inning; Posada's knee guard was split in two, and he could not immediately put any weight on his right leg. But X-rays indicated that Posada had no fractures, and he might be able to play within the next couple of days, Torre said.</p>
        <p>Paul O'Neill strained the right side of his right calf running the bases in the first inning, but did not expect to miss much time.</p>
        <p>Neither player will be in the lineup Sunday against the Braves left-hander Terry Mulholland, when the Yankees (29-22) play the final game of their three-game series against Atlanta (36-18).</p>
        <p>O'Neill singled in the first inning against Maddux, the third of four consecutive hits -- the first time in Maddux's career that he allowed four hits to begin a game. The Yankees had two runs in, runners at second and third and nobody out against Maddux. Clemens was coming off his 13-strikeout outing against Pedro Martinez. It looked as if the Yankees might have a chance to sweep the team with the best record in baseball.</p>
        <p>But the Yankees failed to add to their lead in that inning, Clemens allowed a single to the first batter he faced and the whole thing turned into a mess. Clemens again had great speed, throwing 97 miles an hour, but was ineffective; he allowed six hits, four walks, six runs -- four earned -- in five innings and remains a mystery.</p>
        <p>''He wasn't very good,'' Torre said. ''I don't know the reason for it.''</p>
        <p>Clemens and Maddux have 479 victories and 9 Cy Young awards between them, but they labored to compile exactly one scoreless half-inning each. The Yankees scored at least one run in their first four innings, the Braves scored in each of the first three innings, and the lead changed hands repeatedly.</p>
        <p>When Clemens retired the Braves in order in the fourth, he raised his arms in mock jubilation.</p>
        <p>''You look at Clemens, you look at Maddux, you think 2-1, 3-2,'' said Pat Corrales, the Braves coach who managed the team for the day while Bobby Cox attended the high school graduation of his youngest daughter.</p>
        <p>Derek Jeter had 4 hits among the Yankees' 13 against Maddux, the second most Maddux has allowed in his career. But the offense, which ran aggressively to take advantage of Maddux's slow delivery, couldn't keep up with the rate at which the Yankees' defense was giving away runs. Clemens threw wildly toward first on a pick-off attempt in the first inning, eventually costing himself a run.</p>
        <p>Second baseman Chuck Knoblauch committed another anxiety throwing error in the second, his ninth error of the season. Jeter fumbled what should have been a double-play grounder in the third, and when Brian Jordan launched a three-run homer, Jeter flung a piece of dirt disgustedly, feeling responsible for two of the runs.</p>
        <p>Despite all that, the Yankees held a 6-5 lead in the bottom of the fifth. With two outs and a runner at first, Javy Lopez drove a ball to deep center, where Bernie Williams sprinted to reach the ball -- and then missed it, pulling in his glove, perhaps wary of running into the fence. ''I've got to catch that ball,'' he said later.</p>
        <p>Doggedly, the Yankees regained a 7-6 advantage in the sixth, Chris Turner slapping a run-scoring single against Maddux; Turner, who had homered and walked earlier after replacing Posada, was the last batter Maddux faced.</p>
        <p>But with two outs and no one on base in the bottom of the seventh, Tino Martinez flubbed a throw to Jason Grimsley, allowing Jordan to reach base. Grimsley (1-1) hit the next batter with a pitch, and both runners scored when Lopez lined a double into the gap in left-center field.</p>
        <p>Shoddy infield defense has plagued the Yankees all year, with the shortstops committing 7 errors, the second basemen making 11, the third basemen 13. The Yankees have surrendered 30 unearned runs, only 7 fewer than they did during the entire 1998 season.</p>
        <p>Trailing by four runs in the ninth, the Yankees had one last chance when Rocker sprinted out of the bullpen to pitch the final inning. With the Turner Field fans roaring, Rocker's on-field control abandoned him, the way it abandoned Mark Wohlers two years ago. Rocker walked Scott Brosius. He hit Jim Leyritz with the count no balls and two strikes. He walked Jeter, loading the bases with two out.</p>
        <p>He fell behind Spencer. Leo Mazzone, the Atlanta pitching coach, threw the bullpen phone in disgust. After almost four hours, the situation was absurd. So was the game.</p>
        <p>Spencer swung at a high fastball, and the ball soared toward left field, through a slight wind, to where Trenidad Hubbard backed against the fence, reached up and made the catch.</p>
        <p>It was the Braves' first home victory against the Yankees since Game 2 of the 1958 World Series.</p>
        <p>Torre was at that game, a teenager rooting for his older brother Frank, who was the first baseman for the Milwaukee Braves.</p>
        <p>But he wasn't thinking about that as he trudged into the clubhouse this evening. He had some things to say.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>Pitching for Class A Tampa, ADRIAN HERNANDEZ retired his first 12 hitters, 8 on strikeouts. Hernandez, 25, who defected from Cuba in January, struck out 13 from Fort Myers.</p>
