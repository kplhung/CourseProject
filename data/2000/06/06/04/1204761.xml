        <p>Angela Augugliaro, the president of the Queens Colony Civic Association, said many of her neighbors had no idea that the spanking white Colonial on 247-22 88th Road in Bellerose was a group home for six developmentally disabled and retarded adults.</p>
        <p>''That's a good sign,'' said Ms. Augugliaro, because it meant the place was fitting into the neighborhood, despite misgivings expressed by some local residents when the project was announced a year ago.</p>
        <p>The group home was established as part of the $360 million New York Cares Program, a state effort to open residences for thousands of adult New Yorkers with mental disabilities. The goal in the city is to move nearly 1,500 people into some 350 new homes by the end of 2003.</p>
        <p>In the past two years, nearly a third of the homes currently planned in the city have opened or been approved. The task of finding sites for homes and companies to run them has gone relatively smoothly, according to Deborah Sturm Rausch, a spokesman for the state Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities.</p>
        <p>But winning community acceptance before the homes open has not always been easy.</p>
        <p>Last year, Ms. Augugliaro complained to local elected officials that Bellerose already contained too many social service operations. But Community Board 13, which had the power to suggest an alternative site, took no action, even though it passed a moratorium several years ago on new group homes in the area.</p>
        <p>The home opened on April 27. Ms. Augugliaro, who attended the event, at which Gov. George E. Pataki and other local officials presided, said she was won over when the brother of one resident asked if his sister would be safe in the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>''It made me realize that these are people who have families who love and care about them,'' Ms. Augugliaro said.</p>
        <p>In contrast, Community Board 3, which covers southern Staten Island, voted in March to oppose a new group home at 119 End Place in Greenridge. Dozens of residents spoke vigorously against the project at a public meeting, claiming it would bring noise and increased traffic to the area. At a special hearing on May 4, John Antoniello, chairman of the board, echoed Ms. Augugliaro's in Queens, in this case that district was oversaturated with social services.</p>
        <p>But state law allows for a group home to be barred from a neighborhood only if there is an identical one -- in this case a home for four to eight adults with round-the-clock supervision -- nearby. Since this was not the case here, the state informed the board on Wednesday that the home would open.</p>
        <p>Tom McAlvanah, a spokesman for Lifespire, a company that operates group homes throughout the city, said he had heard people suggest that homes be grouped together in an isolated area.</p>
        <p>''We tried that; it was called Willowbrook,'' said Mr. McAlvanah, referring to a notorious institution for the mentally retarded on Staten Island that was closed in 1978 because of appalling conditions. Subsequent state laws called for the establishment of small group homes for retarded adults. ''It's a touchy situation,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Antoniello worries that as more group homes are announced for the area, resentment against them may grow and it may become increasingly difficult to find sites for them.</p>
        <p>''As soon as some homeowners hear the words 'group home,' '' he said. ''all their warning bells go off.''</p>
