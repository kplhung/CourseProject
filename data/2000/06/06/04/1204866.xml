        <p>Already this season, Mike Piazza has been knocked flat on his back by a 5-foot-10-inch utility player, thumped on the elbow by a helmet in a home plate collision and whacked on the forehead by a backswing.</p>
        <p>There are all kinds of hazards about his job, said Piazza, who was back at catcher in the Mets lineup last night after missing Friday's game as he recovered from a concussion sustained on Wednesday, when the Dodgers' Gary Sheffield struck him on the head on his follow-through. If he has any fear, Piazza said, he might as well not play.</p>

        <p>Already this season, Mike Piazza has been knocked flat on his back by a 5-foot-10-inch utility player, thumped on the elbow by a helmet in a home plate collision and whacked on the forehead by a backswing.</p>
        <p>There are all kinds of hazards about his job, said Piazza, who was back at catcher in the Mets lineup last night after missing Friday's game as he recovered from a concussion sustained on Wednesday, when the Dodgers' Gary Sheffield struck him on the head on his follow-through. If he has any fear, Piazza said, he might as well not play.</p>
        <p>''You're always going to have in the back of your mind that it's possible to have a serious injury,'' Piazza said.</p>
        <p>Piazza knows that whenever he is injured -- he was unhurt in his collision with the Phillies' Kevin Sefcik, but missed four days with an elbow problem after a collision with the Rockies' Todd Helton -- he will be asked about the risks of his position. That frustrates him, he said, but he is a catcher, and there are few precautions he can take.</p>
        <p>Piazza has no plans to squat farther behind the hitter to avoid an injury like Wednesday's. ''If I'm way back and I can't block a ball in the dirt,'' he said, ''the ball gets by and the runner scores, it's not doing any good.''</p>
        <p>Further, there is nothing he can do to prevent home plate collisions. He worries about blowing out a knee, he said, but even smaller players like Sefcik are a threat today. ''You see some bone-jarring collisions,'' Piazza said. ''Twenty or thirty years ago, there was one guy on a team who could do that.''</p>
        <p>Setback for Wilson</p>
        <p>The right-hander Rick Reed threw about 10 pitches off a mound last night as he tries to make his scheduled start on Tuesday. Reed missed Friday's scheduled start after sustaining a strained left oblique muscle last Saturday in St. Louis.</p>
        <p>If he can't go on Tuesday and has to be placed on the disabled list, General Manager Steve Phillips said the Mets might recall a starter or reliever from Class AAA Norfolk. But while Bobby M. Jones, Grant Roberts and Dennis Springer will be considered, Paul Wilson will not. Wilson, the former No. 1 overall pick who is coming back from reconstructive elbow surgery in March 1999, is being skipped in the Norfolk rotation because of tenderness in his shoulder.</p>
