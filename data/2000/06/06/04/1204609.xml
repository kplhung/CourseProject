        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>The Memorial Day weekend getaway crowd was packed into the DeCamp bus heading for Montclair last Friday; the dispatcher at the Port Authority stuck his head in the door and ordered those standing in the aisles to squinch closer together to make room for a few more passengers.</p>
        <p>The disgorging was equally uncomfortable, as passengers getting off squeezed by those standing up. One man working his way forward raised his voice, telling the driver to wait, at which point a man at the front of the bus told him: ''Relax. The driver will wait.''</p>

        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>The Memorial Day weekend getaway crowd was packed into the DeCamp bus heading for Montclair last Friday; the dispatcher at the Port Authority stuck his head in the door and ordered those standing in the aisles to squinch closer together to make room for a few more passengers.</p>
        <p>The disgorging was equally uncomfortable, as passengers getting off squeezed by those standing up. One man working his way forward raised his voice, telling the driver to wait, at which point a man at the front of the bus told him: ''Relax. The driver will wait.''</p>
        <p>The exiting man snapped, ''I am  relaxed.''</p>
        <p>The man standing up laughed, thinking the exiting man was being facetious. The exiting man was now face to face with him.</p>
        <p>''I sure as hell am relaxed!'' he said with a glare.</p>
        <p>The man standing, less sure now that the other man was joking, said, ''You convinced me.''</p>
        <p>One last angry glance, and the passenger headed off down Grove Street. Let's hope he was less ''relaxed'' once he had barbecue tools in his hand.</p>

        <p>The bus was not the only place where nerves were frayed before the three-day weekend. A conductor on the Midtown Direct out of Pennsylvania Station also seemed to have misplaced his holiday spirit.</p>
        <p>The train leaving early Friday afternoon was unusually crowded with people trying to get a head start on the weekend.</p>
        <p>Consequently, some people were standing in the vestibules at the ends of the cars -- a no-no if there ever was one.</p>
        <p>This led the conductor to bellow over the public address system, ''Please move to the rear of the train or no one gets off in Newark.''</p>
        <p>Disbelieving passengers looked at each other and marveled at the conductor's chutzpah.</p>
        <p>Several moments later -- as the train was drawing closer to Broad Street station -- the conductor asked a colleague on the public address system: ''Rear brake. Are they moving?''</p>
        <p>Our hero. No wonder some women love men in uniforms.</p>

        <p>We arrange by phone to meet two other couples at 6:30 at Bennigan's. The restaurant, after all, is right off Route 46, so it's convenient for everyone.</p>
        <p>Two couples show up at 6:30, wait 35 minutes and then order without the third couple. An accident? A traffic jam? Maybe they forgot?</p>
        <p>Home by 9:30, we phone and learn our missing friends waited 25 minutes, then ordered.</p>
        <p>Problem was they ate at the Bennigan's off Route 46 in Wayne, while we ate at the Bennigan's off Route 46 in Parsippany.</p>

        <p>Spring is the season</p>
        <p>When people are sneeezin',</p>
        <p>From great clouds of pollen</p>
        <p>That have blown or have fallen</p>
        <p>From trees that are keen</p>
        <p>To pass on their genes.</p>
        <p>It's how trees procreate,</p>
        <p>It's trees on a date --</p>
        <p>Though I'm sure if they could,</p>
        <p>They'd mate wood-to-wood.</p>
