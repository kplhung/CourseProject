        <p>L'Occitane en Provence, a 23-year-old French purveyor of bath and beauty products, has opened a compact store in The Westchester mall in White Plains, joining the company's more than two dozen shops in Manhattan and upscale communities like Beverly Hills, Calif., and Short Hills, N.J. ''The Westchester is definitely our clientele,'' said Wendy Terebesi, New York regional manager for the company, which offers essential-oil perfume, candles and skin-care products.</p>
        <p>''A lot of our customers work in the city, and are familiar with us from the city. They are also well traveled, and a lot of them know us from Europe.''</p>
