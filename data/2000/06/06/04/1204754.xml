        <p>At Cornell University, a team of student researchers has found a way to pack a whole salad into a 5-by-2-inch snack bar -- freeze-dried tomatoes, green and red peppers, carrots, onions, radishes, celery and cucumbers mixed with croutons and bound together with an egg-white paste, molded and baked into something rather like a granola bar.

        <p>Genetically engineered foods may or may not have undesirable side effects, but the furor over them is certainly having one: the ''Frankenfood'' hoo-hah is obscuring the great strides scientists are making to perfect mankind's array of comestibles without mucking with DNA.</p>
        <p>At Cornell University, a team of student researchers has found a way to pack a whole salad into a 5-by-2-inch snack bar -- freeze-dried tomatoes, green and red peppers, carrots, onions, radishes, celery and cucumbers mixed with croutons and bound together with an egg-white paste, molded and baked into something rather like a granola bar. ''Our greatest challenge was the texture of the product,'' said David Feuerman, a senior.</p>
        <p>The concoction is one of six finalists in an Institute of Food Technology competition to be judged at the group's convention in Dallas next weekend. Cornell teams won in 1995 for toaster-ready pizza and in 1996 for pencil-size cookies dipped in heat-resistant chocolate for coffee dunking.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, 3,752 miles due south in Lima, Peru, the Associated Press reports that scientists at the National Institute for Agrarian Investigation have been working for 25 years to develop a faster-growing, plumper and tastier breed of a vital indigenous meat animal: the guinea pig.</p>
        <p>Peruvians eat 65 million of the high-protein, lowfat, low-cholesterol rodents annually, though they often undo some of those benefits by deep-frying. Picking the sinewy, distinctive-flavored meat from the bony carcass is a project, though, and the yield from each animal is scant; thus the push for a meatier strain.</p>
        <p>Though guinea pigs are also enjoyed in neighboring countries, export prospects seem limited, not least by fragmentation. Nearly every Andean household has some scampering around the kitchen, researchers said, but hardly anyone raises them commercially.</p>
