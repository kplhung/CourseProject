        <p>THIRTY-FOUR years ago, during the filming of his ballet ''Le Jeune Homme et la Mort,'' the French choreographer Roland Petit walked into Rudolf Nureyev's dressing room to check on his star's makeup. ''He said to me, 'Am I looking good?' '' Mr. Petit recalled recently. ''I said, 'You're as good as Marilyn Monroe.' He looked at me. 'Is it a compliment?' I replied, 'Of course.' ''</p>
        <p>Like any star, Nureyev was anxious about his screen image. From his early days in Leningrad, he used film to critique not only his dancing but his curtain calls. ''The first time he saw 8-millimeter footage which a friend shot at the end of a Kirov performance, he became very depressed because his bows were, in his words, 'pathetic,' '' said Wallace Potts, the film archivist for the Rudolf Nureyev Foundation in Liechtenstein and the dancer's longtime friend.</p>
        <p>But Nureyev's ideas about what film could do for dance extended beyond his own personal use, in part because he developed a sophisticated knowledge of film language. According to Mr. Potts, Nureyev could describe the Odessa Steps montage in the classic 1925 film ''Potemkin''  ''as if he were some kind of VCR quickly playing back the entire sequence.''</p>
        <p>As a consequence, Nureyev was keen to expand the scope of the ballet film beyond preserving a particular choreography or broadcasting a stage performance. For him, film could show off a dancer's kinetic energy as well as provide a close-up of the disciplined and expressive use of the body.</p>
        <p>On Friday through next Sunday the Film Society of Lincoln Center is presenting ''This is Nureyev! A Weekend of Dance on Film,'' a series of four programs that will be repeated on June 16 and 17 at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Shot mostly during the 1960's, when Nureyev was at his peak, the films provide an intimate look at his extraordinary dancing prowess. They also bear witness to his strong but seldom realized ambitions for the ballet film.</p>
        <p>The program starts with the earliest 35-millimeter film of Nureyev dancing. In April 1958, he won first prize at the Moscow National Classical Ballet Contest. In a voice-over to the two-minute, black-and-white clip of his winning ''Le Corsaire'' solo, shot two days after the contest, the narrator notes that ''this artist is characterized by his hot temperament and boldness.''</p>
        <p>Liuba Myasnikova, a close friend from Nureyev's student days and now a research scientist at the Institute of the Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg, recalled in a telephone interview: ''His movements weren't as pure as they were later on. But he was beside himself with joy at winning. He always wanted to be at the top.''</p>
        <p>Not long after defecting to the West in 1961, Nureyev began his legendary partnership with Margot Fonteyn. The magic of this pairing is captured in an eight-minute excerpt of their 1965 ''Le Corsaire'' pas de deux.</p>
        <p>The couple is also featured in the 126-minute filmed version of Kenneth MacMillan's highly successful 1965 Royal Ballet production of ''Romeo and Juliet,'' with the 46-year-old Fonteyn as Juliet. This was supposed to have been a breakthrough in the ballet film, because its director, Paul Czinner, placed eight cameras in front of a sound stage at Pinewood Studios. According to production notes from the time, this enabled Czinner to shoot ''the spectacle from every conceivable angle.'' But the ploy did not make the experience more intimate, and the result remains a standard theatrical performance in which the audience is always distant from the action.</p>
        <p>There was no time for cinematic experimentation during the making of the documentary ''This Is Rudolf Nureyev'' in Spoleto, Italy, in 1964. Never before publicly screened in this country, the film shows Nureyev, at 26, flexing his wings as a choreographer for the second company of the Royal Ballet, staging a production of Petipa's ''Raymonda.'' In the 50-minute film, his persistent attention to detail and encouragement of the company becomes a fascinating portrait of a dancer truly obsessed.</p>
        <p>According to Mr. Potts, it was around this time that this obsession with every facet of ballet led Nureyev to demand more input into the films he was starring in.</p>
        <p>Being in front of the camera, however, often made this difficult. He argued continuously with Pierre Jourdan, the director of the documentary ''I Am a Dancer,'' begun in 1970, and finally refused the producer's wish that only ''Rudolf Nureyev'' appear above the title. As a way of expressing his displeasure, Nureyev demanded that Margot Fonteyn be given equal billing, even though he was the subject of the film.</p>
        <p>''I Am a Dancer'' offers a rare glimpse into the daily rigors of Nureyev's professional life. Arriving in a leather trench coat and a cap, a very Russian outfit, he transforms a utilitarian dressing room into a private haven, methodically unpacking his glittering costumes and changing into a worn leotard. This is followed by a rigorous warm-up, in which Mr. Jourdan's camera closely observes the dancer's extraordinarily fast and controlled footwork.</p>
        <p>Originally shot for French television and including such period gems as the complete Fredrick Ashton ballet ''Marguerite and Armand,'' the film was expanded to feature length for theatrical release. According to John Percival, the editor of the now defunct Dance and Dancers who wrote the narration, Nureyev insisted that the longer version show a broader range of his work.</p>
        <p>Thus, Mr. Jourdan included an extraordinary sequence of Nureyev and Deanne Bergsma, their bodies often totally intertwined, rehearsing Glen Tetley's modern ballet ''Field Figures.''</p>
        <p>''There was this animal instinct, almost animal movement in him, that made him fit quite naturally into every nuance of the choreography,'' Mr. Tetley said recently.</p>
        <p>But suggestions about content were not enough for Nureyev. ''He made sure the editor took his direction for the film rather than the ostensible director's,'' Mr. Percival recalled.</p>
        <p>In 1972, Nureyev finally got his chance to go behind the camera. The 103-minute ''Don Quixote,'' scrupulously restored last year by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, was directed by Nureyev and the Australian dancer Robert Helpmann. It features members of the Australian Ballet, and Nureyev performs the role of Basilio and Lucette Aldous that of Kitri.</p>
        <p>As director, Nureyev took the camera onto the stage. ''He wanted it to be one of the dancers,'' said Peter McDonald, the first assistant cameraman.</p>
        <p>Both Mr. McDonald and the director of photography, Geoffrey Unsworth, had joined Nureyev's crew following their work on Bob Fosse's ''Cabaret'' and Stanley Kubrick's ''2001: A Space Odyssey.'' Using an aircraft hangar in the Melbourne suburb of Essendon, Nureyev took advantage of a colorful set twice the size of a conventional stage. It was constructed to allow the dancers to be captured from almost any angle, and Nureyev insisted that the camera move at the same speed as the dancers.</p>
        <p>''In the beginning he came out of the wings at 40 miles per hour and went right past us,'' recalled Mr. McDonald, now a director, who had to rely on six burly Australian grips to push the camera. ''After that, we learned how to keep up.''</p>
        <p>WHENEVER the disciplines of ballet and film collided, Nureyev never wavered in his loyalty to his first love. ''He would never want to cut to a close-up because he wanted at all times to preserve what the body was doing,'' recalled Mr. Potts, who, in 1972, was a first assistant director on ''Don Quixote.''</p>
        <p>The directing role suited Mr. Nureyev's temperament. ''When Barry Kay was making my costume, Rudi would stand there, approving of some it and tearing off the bits he didn't like,'' remembered Ms. Aldous, who, at 61, is senior classical-ballet lecturer at the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts in Perth.</p>
        <p>Nureyev looked through the camera before every shot, and during the editing of the film he moved its editor, along with his Moviola, into the bedroom of his London flat. In a review in The New York Times in November 1973, Anna Kisselgoff called ''Don Quixote''  ''a dance film for all audiences, an exciting, intelligently conceived spectacle.''</p>
        <p>Nureyev got only one more chance to get behind a camera. In 1986, he directed the Paris Opera's television production of ''The Nutcracker,'' shot on videotape (it is not in the festival).</p>
        <p>''Ballet film productions never made any money,'' said John Hargreaves, the producer of ''Don Quixote.'' Probably no one would be sadder about this than the film producer and distributor Walter Reade, who put up $750,000 to make ''Don Quixote.'' Happily, in the Lincoln Center theater that now bears Mr. Reade's name, what was accomplished nearly three decades ago can now be seen again.</p>
