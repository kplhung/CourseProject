        <p>CURT PEOPLES of Toronto went to Myrtle Beach, S.C., with a friend for a weekend of golf last month. He was taken aback to discover they had arrived in the midst of a huge convergence called Harley-Davidson Week. Mr. Peoples said that from his hotel, the Caribbean Resort on Ocean Boulevard, he could hear the parade of bikes making its way around the Route 17 loop until 1 a.m. nightly.  Sleep was elusive, Mr. Peoples said, and the drive back to the Charlotte, N.C., airport, a trip that normally takes three hours, took four and a half because of the traffic.</p>
        <p>The local Harley-Davidson shop estimates that 250,000 machines were in town for the week. The Myrtle Beach Grand Strand area has 60,000 rooms for rent, including condominiums for six or eight people, according to Jennifer Coons at the Chamber of Commerce, and she considers the figure of a quarter of a million motorcycles quite plausible. Last year, it was 100,000.</p>
        <p>Mr. Peoples said he does not consider himself anti-biker, but he and his golfing friend would plan their trip differently next year.</p>
        <p>The experience brings up the question: What steps can the leisure traveler seeking a quiet getaway take to avoid sleepless nights and choked highways that may develop around unanticipated conventions?</p>
        <p>Motorcycle Rallies</p>
        <p>First, avoid large numbers of internal combustion engines. The bikers' week that Mr. Peoples encountered is actually considered a tranquil respite in the biking community. ''They mostly come to ride around and admire each other's bikes,'' said Dale Coyner of Communicast, a producer of live Web events in Herndon, Va., and author of ''Motorcycle Journeys Through the Appalachians'' (Whitehorse Press).</p>
        <p>Mr. Coyner said that the Myrtle Beach week had a family quality because it has been fostered by the Blue Knights, an organization of bikers who are current or retired law officers. He said this was unlike a week in Sturgis, S.D., which he said was ''notorious'' (this year's rally is scheduled for Aug. 7 to 13). For Myrtle Beach, he said, the carefully maintained bikes are brought in on trailers lest they get scratched or dirty on the highway. This was part of the congestion on the route to Charlotte. Moreover, the Myrtle Beach week, he said, is a tiny shadow of the Daytona Beach week, which in March was reported to have attracted 600,000 motorcycles. The Daytona 200 race is run then.</p>
        <p>Mr. Coyner said that motorcycles from the factory were quieter than they became after the owners modified them with straight exhausts. The Motorcycle Industry Council in Irvine, Calif., says that the maximum level allowable is 80 decibels, and that it is illegal to sell components that cause a motorcycle to exceed the limit. ''It's illegal but not enforced,'' Mr. Coyner said.</p>
        <p>Mark Reber, an acoustical consultant at Shen, Milsom &amp; Wilke in New York, said a modified motorcycle could be measured at 95 decibels or above if one stood nearby. For contrast, the ambient noise in a New York street is about 50 to 60 decibels, Mr. Reber said, while the sound in a subway tunnel with two trains passing would be around 95. He said that for every rise of 10 decibels, the sound would be perceived as doubling in loudness.</p>
        <p>One Web site maintained by a moviemaker and biker, Ronnie Kramer, includes an alphabetical listing of biker events of all sorts: www .sepnet.com/cycle/events.htm. A Harley-Davidson events list is found at www.harley-davidson.com.</p>
        <p>Asking a hotel or convention and visitors bureau what events are scheduled in the area you plan a visit is one step travelers can take. Really big events, like Daytona, soak up the available rooms a year in advance and drive up prices.</p>
        <p>My journalism class plans a meeting in Gainesville, Fla., next spring. But until the major automobile drag-racing group, the National Hot Rod Association, picks its 2001 date for its Gator Nationals there, we are holding alternate dates open. Avoiding the event seems like a wise decision. A colleague who covers auto races said that the sound of a drag race can be heard five miles off. Mr. Reber said this was perfectly likely.</p>
        <p>Again, to participants, the racket is part of the attraction. The National Hot Rod Association recently reiterated that an upper limit of 95 decibels, as measured 50 feet from the engine, was set on Jan. 1 for all stock and superstock vehicles competing in organization events, but, the Web site announcement said, the ''vast majority'' had chosen to ignore the rule. Moreover, these vehicles are quieter than the 5,000-horsepower top fuel dragsters that are part of the mythology. The hot rod association and related groups have about 50 events scheduled between now and November. In the cold weather, these are in the South, but by August they are in places like Norwalk, Ohio, and Indianapolis. The schedule is maintained at www.bmracing.com.</p>
        <p>Fiestas and Discos</p>
        <p>There are other noises that can wreck a vacation. Unless you face on a courtyard, a room in the French Quarter of New Orleans is not likely to be restful any night of the year, particularly holidays. But most people who want quiet in Louisiana do not pick the French Quarter.</p>
        <p>Events designed to bring in tourists to celebrate in the streets --  Fiesta in San Antonio, for example --  also have their own distant early warnings in high hotel prices and limited availability. In addition, there are holidays unique to some states, traffic-halting marathon races and nationality parades across the country. Local hotel clerks and tourist bureaus know about these, and they should be asked for a schedule. Holidays overseas may bring noise in the street, or the opposite: shuttered banks, museums, stores and information bureaus. It is worthwhile to check guidebooks for these lists, especially if they are religious holidays that may shift with a lunar calendar. Canada's National Day, July 1, can come as a surprise on a trip across the border; likewise Dec. 26 and the Monday after Easter, which are bank holidays in England.</p>
        <p>Hotel rooms just above the disco are an awful problem, and if the room is rented early in the day, the situation may not be apparent. When making reservations, ask about the location of any late-night clubs. Other hazards are the swimming pool, the parking lot and the place where trash is picked up early in the morning. Lately the Travel section has received a rash of letters complaining of hotel construction, a byproduct of a booming economy, or reconstruction in the Caribbean after hurricane damage. This is less an  evening problem than one for early in the morning. If there are dropcloths and trash bins on your floor, ask for another. When renting a vacation house, ask the agent if the view from the porch is likely to include a construction crew during your stay.</p>
        <p>At this time of year, it is nearly impossible to avoid graduation parties and wedding receptions. Samuel F. Pryor III, a partner at Davis, Polk &amp; Wardwell in New York, said he arrived in Durango, Colo., at the time of a major bikers' gathering last year. ''They were parked head-in as far as you could see,'' he said. But the noise was not such a problem. ''We were attending a wedding,'' he said, ''making some of our own.''</p>
