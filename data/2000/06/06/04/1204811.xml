        <p>Need some extra cash to help pay for your summer vacation? If you live in a city like New York, Chicago or San Francisco where hotel rooms can cost hundreds of dollars a night, one way to get it is to rent out your home while you are away.</p>
        <p>Sidney Kess, a New York tax lawyer and accountant, points out that no tax is due on income from renting out your home for fewer than 15 days a year. ''You do not even have to report it,'' he said. ''You cannot deduct any operating expenses, such as maintenance and depreciation, but if you itemize your deductions, you can still deduct all of your mortgage interest and real estate taxes.''</p>

        <p>Home rentals can be a windfall for people who live in cities where an event like the World Series, a major convention, or the Olympics takes place, he said.</p>
        <p>Home-swapping for vacations is also popular, Mr. Kess noted. Families from New York and Colorado, for example, might swap homes for a week or two. ''Then if the Yankees are in the World Series, the New Yorkers can still rent out their home at that time and earn tax-free income,'' he said.</p>
