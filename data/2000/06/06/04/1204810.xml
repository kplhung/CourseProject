        <p>Fund investors worried about the government's tax bite may just want to steer their money to a portfolio manager who is based in Houston. For those with money in individual retirement accounts or other tax-advantaged vehicles, Connecticut could be the place to look.</p>
        <p>That is one way to look at a peculiar survey by Thomson Financial Investor Relations, a New York shareholder communications firm, which surveyed money managers in 61 metropolitan areas to determine their average turnover ratio for 1999.</p>
        <p>Looking at the results for the top 10 United States metropolitan areas, money managers in the Hartford and southern Connecticut region reported the highest turnover ratios by far, an average of 85.5 percent. Those based in Houston reported the lowest turnover, just 42.8 percent.</p>
        <p>Why the high turnover in Connecticut? Richard A. Wines, senior managing director at the firm, points out that southern Connecticut has a disproportionate number of hedge funds, many known for their rapid-fire trading.</p>
        <p>The drop off is fairly steep after Connecticut. Managers in Philadelphia and Wilmington, Del. had an average turnover of 67 percent, followed by New York City (56.9 percent), Denver (56.2 percent), Chicago (53.3 percent), San Francisco (52.2 percent), Boston (50.1 percent), Los Angeles (46.2 percent), and Minneapolis-St. Paul (46.1 percent).</p>
