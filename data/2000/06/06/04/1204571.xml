        <p>AFTER a dreary winter, a sort of spring fever of the palate now affects many of us; such a malady is best satisfied by the arrival of the first fresh, locally grown produce of the season.</p>
        <p>Thomas Jefferson, the only true gourmet among our presidents, waxed ecstatic over fresh vegetables and kept a chart of when certain ones were available in his own large garden or local market. In his Garden Book of 1774, he noted ''May 16. First dish of peas from earliest patch.'' There were five more patches, each duly recorded, until the entry of July 13: ''Last dish of peas.''</p>
        <p>The first Connecticut-nurtured peas made their appearance some weeks ago, as did early spring asparagus, but there is a variety of locally grown produce still steadily arriving. One of the pleasures of grocery shopping at this time of the year is making these seasonal discoveries. What could taste better than sweet garden-fresh peas or the earliest leaf lettuces? Now we can savor such tender and pleasing ones as oak leaf, deer tongue, butter crunch and crisp head, all cultivated by Connecticut growers. With the sunshine has come a good supply of spinach, scallions, kale, leeks as well as a variety of herbs, chives and oregano among them.</p>
        <p>Available also are greenhouse tomatoes and cucumbers, ingredients worthy of a sparkling fresh spring salad, with perhaps the added touch of a little goat cheese, also made now in Connecticut.</p>
        <p>What is it about locally-grown garden-and-farm produce that is so special?</p>
        <p>''It's the unique crispness, flavor and freshness,'' said Rick Macsuga, marketing representative of the State Department of Agriculture, ''not like the uniformity of regular supermarket produce.''</p>
        <p>For the cook, the homemaker, the food fancier, there is a sense of excitement when the seasons change, especially the change from winter to the growing seasons of spring and early summer. The early local strawberries are arriving; broccoli and mushrooms are not far behind.</p>
        <p>Along with fresh produce, Connecticut farmers are ready for spring with a profusion of cut flowers.</p>
        <p>The Hartford Regional Market (open daily) is an excellent source for spectacular cut flowers, bedding plants for the garden, both annuals and perennials, shrubs and trees. This market is a magnet for gardeners drawn to wholesale-priced, splendiferous Connecticut-grown plants.</p>
        <p>Thinking about local produce and food products reminds one that it is the advent of the farmers' market season.</p>
        <p>Nine of the 62 state-supervised farmers' markets are already open several days of the week. These include markets in Chester, Greenwich, Kent, New Milford, Seymour, Storrs, West Hartford and the Urban Oaks Farm Market in New Britain.  Last Monday the downtown farmers' market opened in Hartford, and on Thursday the market in Trumbull. The all-organic Meadow Street market in Willimantic also opened Thursday; Friday was the farmers' market opening in Rowayton. Most of the others will be open by the middle of the month, the rest (including a first-time one in New Canaan) in early July. Many of the markets will continue to operate until Thanksgiving or as long as fresh produce is available.</p>
        <p>In addition to what is seasonal, the early-season farmers' markets feature eggs, honey, maple syrup, goat and cow cheese as well as baked goods, all from Connecticut farms or bakeries. It may be late to watch the maple syrup being tapped from trees at local sugarhouses (there are 31 throughout the state) but it isn't too late to buy the syrup and maple products at some of the farmers' markets.</p>
        <p>Finally, now that strawberries have put in an appearance, peaches, nectarines, pears, eggplants, squashes, melons and tomatoes cannot be far behind. If the early produce is any indication, a season of abundance awaits.</p>
        <p>Hartford Regional Market (101 Reserve Road, Hartford; 860-527-5047). Take the Brainard Road-Airport Road exit from Interstate 91; The market is open 4 a.m. to around 6:30 a.m. Monday through Friday, 4 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. Saturday, 5 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. Sunday.</p>
