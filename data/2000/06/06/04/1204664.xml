        <p>Rye (NY) Board of Education votes, 4 to 3, to install permanent lights, paid for by group of parents, for night play at high school's John Nugent Stadium; nightime activities will be restricted to seven varsity games each school year (S)</p>

        <p>After months of public debate, the Rye Board of Education voted 4 to 3 last week to install permanent lights for night play at John Nugent Stadium at the high school. A group of parents will provide $160,000 to buy the lights. Opponents said the lights would mar the adjoining neighborhood, but supporters said it would allow families with two working parents to attend their children's sporting events. The board stipulated that the lights may be turned on only seven times during the school year and only for varsity games. ''We're happy with the vote,'' said John Eyler, president of Toys ''R'' Us and a leader of the pro-light group.</p>
