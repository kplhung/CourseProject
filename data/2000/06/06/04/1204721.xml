        <p>WEIRD? Please! I don't even want to think about it!'' Regis Philbin said in his dressing room at the ABC studios on West 67th Street last week. Mr. Philbin was not referring to the immense, bizarre popularity of his show ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' He was rifling through a rack of shirts and ties bearing his own name. ''Regis by Van Heusen'' is a line whose label promises to capture ''the style and essence of Regis Philbin, America's favorite television personality.''</p>
        <p>What are the odds of a man in his mid-60's becoming a style icon and reinvigorating an entire category of men's wear? Especially when that man is Mr. Philbin? As he himself is the first to acknowledge -- in his inevitably emphatic style -- ''it's really strange!''</p>

        <p>WEIRD? Please! I don't even want to think about it!'' Regis Philbin said in his dressing room at the ABC studios on West 67th Street last week. Mr. Philbin was not referring to the immense, bizarre popularity of his show ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' He was rifling through a rack of shirts and ties bearing his own name. ''Regis by Van Heusen'' is a line whose label promises to capture ''the style and essence of Regis Philbin, America's favorite television personality.''</p>
        <p>What are the odds of a man in his mid-60's becoming a style icon and reinvigorating an entire category of men's wear? Especially when that man is Mr. Philbin? As he himself is the first to acknowledge -- in his inevitably emphatic style -- ''it's really strange!''</p>
        <p>Tomorrow, Mr. Philbin will officially introduce the Regis collection at Macy's Herald Square, where the monochromatic Regis shirts and ties will be sold as matching sets in seven colors (from blue and gray to aubergine and khaki) for $77.50. On June 18, Father's Day, department stores will begin selling the collection nationwide, not as sets but separately. By year-end, 19 ''Millionaire'' shades will be available, with shirts at $39.50 to $50 and ties at $38 to $45.</p>
        <p>But even before the licensing deal was struck, Macy's and other department stores were busy creating a craze, with displays asking customers, ''Who Wants to Look Like a Millionaire?''</p>
        <p>Many American men, it seems. Mark Weber, the president of Phillips-Van Heusen, which is paying Mr. Philbin for his name and his look, projected sales of $50 million for the Regis line this year, based on the orders received so far. At Saks Fifth Avenue, sales of solid shirts and ties had dipped until the ''Millionaire'' show took off last summer, said Dan McCampbell, a vice president and the men's fashion director there. ''There has been a noticeable resurgence,'' Mr. McCampbell said. ''And I think it's pretty fair to attribute it at least in part to this show.''</p>
        <p>To paraphrase Michael Corleone in ''The Godfather: Part III,'' just when you thought ties were out, Mr. Philbin pulled them back in.</p>
        <p>As Brian Boyer, fashion director of the daily men's wear bible DNR, said, ''We call it the Philbinization of neckwear.''</p>
        <p>The same man who used to wear banana-colored sports coats on ''Live With Regis and Kathie Lee'' is now as hip as Gucci, Prada and Helmut Lang -- all of whom will be bringing back the suit and tie this fall.</p>
        <p>Mr. Philbin could not be more on trend. And don't think he doesn't know it.</p>
        <p>''My wife took a second look at me!'' he said. ''And after 30 years, that ain't easy, to get that second look, you know.''</p>
        <p>He preens. He boasts. ''I walk into a restaurant now and meet some old friends who aren't into the style yet,'' he said. And what does he say to them? '''Hey, come on. Get with the 'Millionaire' look. You guys'll never make anything out of yourselves!''</p>
        <p>The Regis shirts and ties had just come in. They were mixed in with the other labels on the rack in his dressing room: Hugo Boss, Cerruti and Beau Brummel, the SoHo men's store that has been outfitting him for 10 years. Mr. Philbin ran the fabric between his thumb and forefingers like a tailor.</p>
        <p>''There's not really much when you look at the choice here,'' he said. ''Burgundy, black. Different shades of gray, different shades of blues. And a green. The green is really a big deal. Green is such a departure. You can wear it with gray!</p>
        <p>''Oh, there's one other wild card. The gold is pretty good, too. It goes good with the gray and with the black. You can wear it with almost anything and it pops right out. And that's what they want. They want it to pop right out of the screen.''</p>
        <p>In 27 countries, ''Millionaire'' hosts cloned from the British original wear the same look. Michael Davies, the show's executive producer, put the show on American television and changed nothing. The set, the music and the host's dark, elegant, vaguely ominous wardrobe are all part of the formula.</p>
        <p>The British-born Mr. Davies, 34, described it as the sort of look worn by ''professional soccer players in Hello! magazine.'' A money look. And he saw Mr. Philbin as being money enough to pull it off.</p>
        <p>''I've always felt that Regis is a very hip guy,'' said Mr. Davies, who came to the United States 10 years ago. ''On 'Letterman,' college kids would always applaud him. There's a certain hipness within his squareness that sort of works.''</p>
        <p>He said that at first, his star reacted to his sartorial makeover with ''raised eyebrows'' but that now ''he's embraced it.''</p>
        <p>The same cannot be said of some male contestants on ''Millionaire.'' Most still tend to be tieless, and at least one showed up for his date with destiny in overalls.</p>
        <p>Still, many fashion experts agree that if anyone can get the increasingly tie-resistant American male to dress at least as well as a British soccer player on a club crawl, Mr. Philbin can. Jim Moore, fashion director at GQ, said that his magazine has been advocating classier attire for the last three years but that ''it takes someone like Regis to really get it out there.''</p>
        <p>''They see Regis in it,'' he said, ''and it just endorses it.''</p>
        <p>Average guys out there may feel more comfortable taking their fashion cues from television than from GQ. Knowing this, apparel companies have taken advantage of the medium as a marketing tool for decades.</p>
        <p>The Botany 500 label was sold to Men's Warehouse three years ago. But its legacy lives on Nick at Nite and TV Land. Something like 75 male television stars have worn the Botany label since its heyday, the 60's, from Dick Van Dyke's skinny suits to the plaid blazers favored by Mike Connors on ''Mannix.''</p>
        <p>Johnny Carson lent his name to a long line of clothing and leisure wear during his career, often combining stripes and checks that would have made a used car salesman blush. In the 80's, Don Johnson imported Armani's Euro look -- peach T-shirts under billowing white suits -- for a generation of men who probably had no business trying it themselves.</p>
        <p>Larry Dorn, who was the press agent for Botany 500 for 25 years, said that Telly Savalas set off a craze for colored vests when he started wearing them on ''Kojak.'' They were especially popular in Europe, Mr. Dorn said, where ''suddenly, everyone wanted to look like Kojak.''</p>
        <p>But now that Mr. Philbin is enjoying his own ''Who loves ya, baby?'' moment, he must deal with serious questions about celebrity-licensed apparel. Questions like, Who makes this stuff? And, Are they being paid a living wage? After his daytime co-host, Kathie Lee Gifford, got into highly publicized trouble in this area, the last thing Mr. Philbin needs is a sweatshop scandal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weber, Phillips-Van Heusen's president, acknowledged that ''given the Kathie Lee situation, Regis is going to be watching us very closely.'' Mr. Weber said one million shirts and as many ties will be made, starting in factories in the United States, then abroad in countries ''yet to be determined.'' (The company has factories in Costa Rica and throughout Asia.)</p>
        <p>As a makeup artist applied flattering tones to Mr. Philbin's cheeks and forehead, his dresser, a recent addition to his staff, selected a navy Regis tie, a blue Hugo Boss shirt and a blue Canali suit.</p>
        <p>Dean Martin crooned, ''You're nobody till somebody loves you,'' on the stereo. Mr. Philbin always plays Dino -- it relaxes him. And he needs it. Being arguably the biggest television star in the country is stressful. And stress is Mr. Philbin's shtick. Even basking in glory as a style icon, he has to complain about something. So he recounted an argument he had with his producer, Mr. Davies. The issue was two buttons versus three.</p>
        <p>''They brought in a beautiful blue suit,'' Mr. Philbin said, working himself up into one of his rants. ''And it was nice fabric and everything, and it was two-button.''</p>
        <p>''And Michael Davies,'' he said, doing a pretty good Cary Grant impersonation, ''said: 'No! This is a three-button show.' So I lost my suit!''</p>
        <p>It's always something. As Bill Zehme, a writer who is now collaborating on his second book with Mr. Philbin, said of his cantankerous subject, ''He's always said he lived under a dark cloud, so now he's got the wardrobe to match.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 11, 2000, Sunday  An article last Sunday about a line of shirts and ties bearing the name of Regis Philbin, the television personality, misstated the date of an appearance he is scheduled to make at Macy's Herald Square to promote the collection. It is tomorrow; it was not June 5.</p>
        <p>The article also misidentified the owner of the Botany 500 clothing label, which was marketed using television personalities of the 1960's. It is McGregor II LLC; Men's Wearhouse makes men's wear with the Botany 500 label under license.</p>
