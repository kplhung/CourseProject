        <p>THE old saying goes, ''Seeing is believing,'' but scientists who study vision might prefer to go with Groucho Marx on this one: when caught in a compromising situation, he came up with the classic alibi, ''Who are you going to believe, me or your own eyes?''</p>
        <p>The truth is that vision is a notoriously gullible sense, and it is the job of the optical illusion to expose its limitations and discover its modus operandi. But the fallibility of sight is not just an issue for the perceptual psychologist: the entire tradition of Western, naturalistic painting depends on a failure of the mind to distinguish between light reflected off three-dimensional surfaces and a flat arrangement of pigments on a canvas. One of the earliest stories in the history of art rests on just such a confusion. It comes from Pliny and concerns a competition between the masters Zeuxius and Parrhasios, in which the former painted a still life so convincing that it deceived a flock of birds who tried to peck at the fruit, while the latter painted a trompe l'oeil curtain so convincing that his rival tried to pull it aside to uncover the painting beneath.</p>
        <p>Optical illusions and illusionist art in general play on the mind's need to make educated guesses about what it sees. Extrapolating a three-dimensional reality from the confusing welter of reflected light our retinas receive is what Steven Pinker, director of the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience at M.I.T. and the author of the best-selling ''How the Mind Works,'' calls ''an ill-posed problem'' -- one for which the available data can lead to many different solutions. Such ambiguities can prove to be an insoluble difficulty for once-blind adults after their sight has been restored, because their brains are not used to unraveling the puzzles the visual world presents. In order to function, Mr. Pinker explains, we must interpret information based on what we know of the world; and it is here that the optical illusion comes into play, exploiting those mental shortcuts we use to make sense of our environment.</p>
        <p>''We play the odds,'' Mr. Pinker says. ''We assume there are no demons, or perceptual psychologists, arranging things just to fool us. The cunning artist exploits our willingness to play the odds.''</p>
        <p>All art that aspires to reproduce visual experience is in some sense an optical illusion. It is no coincidence that in those eras most associated with naturalism in art -- classical Greece and Rome, the Renaissance and the Baroque -- artists were also filling their works with visual puzzles that highlight the paradox of sight. Ancient mosaicists from Antioch delighted in creating patterns of light and dark that appear to be three-dimensional forms flipping back and forth in space, as did Renaissance furniture makers who created similar mind-bending patterns in inlaid wood. In 17th-century Holland, when artists like Vermeer and de Hooch brought the realist tradition to its apogee, visual tricksters like Samuel van Hoogstraten baffled his patrons with trompe l'oeil interiors that seemed continuations of actual architectural spaces and with perspective boxes in which a crazily disjointed world magically assembled itself into a realistic interior when viewed through a peephole.</p>
        <p>Peter Sutton, director of the Wadsworth Atheneum and an authority on 17th-century Dutch art, says that the ambition of these artists was to create, in Hoogstraten's phrase, ''a mirror of nature.'' But as artists before and since have realized, such mirrors have the capacity to render the world strange as well as familiar. A work belonging to the same realist tradition is Hans Holbein's ''Ambassadors'' (1533), which includes perhaps the most famous optical illusion in all of painting: the weird, stretched-taffy skull that sits in the foreground of this otherwise plausible space. The skull is an example of an anamorphosis, a kind of perspectival distortion invented by artists of the Renaissance -- the earliest known example is a drawing by Leonardo da Vinci of a child's head -- who were studying how objects appeared when viewed from odd angles. (To correct the distortion, the viewer must be positioned well to the side of the picture.) According to Mr. Sutton, the skull is tied symbolically to the crucifix half-hidden by the curtain, and the mathematically precise distortion relates to the scientific apparatus arrayed on the table behind the two figures. He sees the painting as a meditation on the fragility of life and the fallibility of the senses that is all the more eloquent for having come from this consummate master of pictorial realism.</p>
        <p>Illusionism in art and the art of optical illusions have both returned to public attention recently with the painter David Hockney's controversial thesis, chronicled by Lawrence Weschler in The New Yorker, that many of the old masters achieved remarkable verisimilitude by using optical aids like the camera obscura, and with the exhibition ''Dali's Optical Illusions,'' which originated at the Wadsworth Atheneum and is on view at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington through June 18. While the verisimilitude of Vermeer and the bizarre dreamscapes of Salvador Dali may seem to have little in common, they are united by an intense focus on how the mind perceives, and misperceives, what is right before its eyes. As Holbein's masterpiece reveals, lurking behind mundane appearances is a world of surpassing strangeness.</p>
        <p>Plato in his ''Republic,'' written at the beginning of the Western naturalistic revolution, condemns the artist for his reliance on the fickle senses: ''And so scene-painting in its exploitation of this weakness of our nature falls nothing short of witchcraft, and so do jugglery and many other contrivances.'' Perceptual psychologists regard this ''weakness in our nature'' as a strength, allowing the human mind to solve insoluble visual conundrums by making assumptions about what kind of forms probably gave rise to particular patterns of light and shade. For artists like Dali, anamorphic distortions provide not simply an interesting insight into the way the mind works but also a key to unlocking its hidden motives. The anamorphic image is an extreme example of the subjectivity implied in all perspective systems, which must take into account the spectator's point of view. For Dali it embodies what he called the ''paranoiac critical'' approach, in which vision is distorted by feelings of attraction and repulsion. Images like his ''Baigneuse'' (1928), a fleshy, tumescent blob reclining on a beach, resemble traditional anamorphic distortions though they cannot be ''corrected'' from any viewpoint. They are forms distorted not so much by the viewer's position in space as by the viewer's, and the painter's, state of mind.</p>
        <p>''Dali was well read in the literature of perspective and optical tricks,'' says the curator of ''Dali's Optical Illusions,'' Dawn Ades of the University of Essex in Colchester, England.. ''His interest in optical illusions has to do with making the irrational workings of the mind real, so that the eyes are tricked into believing them to be true.'' For Ms. Ades, Dali's mastery of traditional illusionistic techniques was a means of suggesting the essential irrationality of even the most scientific systems.</p>
        <p>Another form of optical illusion employed by Dali is the double or hidden image, as in ''The Image Disappears'' (1938), where the artist reworks Vermeer's ''Young Woman Reading a Letter at an Open Window'' so that the female figure takes the form of a bearded man's profile. Like the anamorphosis, the hidden image has a long tradition in Western painting. Perhaps the most famous artist to exploit such doubled images was the 16th-century Italian painter Giuseppe Arcimboldo, who specialized in allegorical figures that seemed to form magically from mounds of fruit or bouquets of flowers.</p>
        <p>DOUBLED imagery appealed to Dali's interest in Freudian methods of dream analysis, in which even the most innocent of forms can conceal thwarted desire. But such visual play predates Surrealism by centuries, as the Wadsworth Atheneum's installation of the Dali exhibition emphasized.</p>
        <p>Included in a related display at the Atheneum were a series of historic works showing that artists have long used optical illusions to reveal hidden meanings. A crude but intriguing anamorphic image by an anonymous 17th-century artist depicting Adam and Eve in the garden employs optical distortions to convey a religious message. It is only from an oblique angle that one can read the inscription, in Latin: ''I am the way and the truth and the life. Whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Think on death.'' As in Holbein's painting, the optical illusion discredits the world apprehended by the senses so that we might dwell on eternal truths. An even closer link between Surrealist concerns and the history of optical illusions is made in the woodcuts of the 16th-century German artist Erhard Schon, reproduced in the exhibition catalog, where landscapes viewed from the side disgorge such covert images as a nude couple embracing or a peasant defecating.</p>
        <p>Optical illusions are endlessly fascinating because they reveal the extent to which what we see is not ''out there'' but inside our brains, where the jumbled data received from the eyes must be assembled into a coherent narrative. Even the science of perspective, which allows the artist to render a three-dimensional world on a two-dimensional surface, is critically dependent on our point of view, injecting an element of subjectivity into an apparently objective process. M. C. Escher's impossible worlds, where water seems to flow uphill or stairs to lead simultaneously up and down, or even the famous line drawing that can appear to be both duck and rabbit, remind us that seeing is as much an act of invention as discovery. ''The brain is hell bent on finding an interpretation of the three-dimensional world,'' says Mr. Pinker, ''and usually it does a pretty good job.'' Despite this good track record, anyone caught red-handed might wish, along with Groucho, to dwell instead on those many instances where our eyes deceive us.</p>
