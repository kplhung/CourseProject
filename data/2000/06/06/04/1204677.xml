        <p>Another bride, another June . . . another season for matrimania. While formal, frothy affairs at the Pierre Hotel will always be in demand, the nuptial forecast this year is a bit more carefree and casual. With things like low-key dresses, anti-stress nuptial beauty products and country herb bouquets, New York nearly-weds are finding new ways to walk down the aisle in laid-back style.</p>
        <p>Casual Dress, or Less</p>

        <p>Another bride, another June . . . another season for matrimania. While formal, frothy affairs at the Pierre Hotel will always be in demand, the nuptial forecast this year is a bit more carefree and casual. With things like low-key dresses, anti-stress nuptial beauty products and country herb bouquets, New York nearly-weds are finding new ways to walk down the aisle in laid-back style.</p>
        <p>Casual Dress, or Less</p>
        <p>The trend toward casual ceremonies, beach vows in particular, has sent brides-to-be browsing beyond Kleinfeld to nonbridal retail stores, seeking alternatives to the traditional yards of tulle. Department stores, boutiques and even mail-order catalogs have reported a bridal rush on white sundresses, evening dresses, and skirts and tops.</p>
        <p>At Henri Bendel, the affianced are favoring flowing Jemima Khan dresses, beaded and embroidered by hand in Pakistan ($1,500). At Intermix, whimsical brides have all but bought out Alberta Ferretti's free-form white taffeta strapless dress with space-age silver bugle beads, square rhinestones and oversize white sequins, shown at left ($1,500). Popular both at the trendy Olive &amp; Bette's store and in the store's mail-order catalog are a peasanty white bustle skirt ($204) by Shoshanna, far right, with a white silky tube top by Susana Monaco ($50).</p>
        <p>Recommended footwear? None. And in this same bare vein, even bikinis have been adapted as wedding garb for seaside brides who really want to take the plunge, among them Intermix's white Inca bikini with mirrored insets ($180), right, and American Eagle Outfitters' white embroidered tankini ($60). Think Pamela Anderson -- and then pray for her body.</p>
        <p>A Little Lavender With the Old Lace</p>
        <p>Floral designers are branching out from roses and orange blossoms and other classic wedding floral fare to bridal bouquets with a little oregano, a pinch of thyme, a dash of basil. ''Herbs are perfect for brides who tend to be less fancy and more funky and are confident about their sense of style,'' said David Stark, an owner of Avi Adler Flowers, who has made herb bouquets for casual seascape weddings from Bridgehampton to Greece. ''Many herbs, like lavender, rosemary, sage and thyme, have gorgeous, delicate flowers, and they smell fantastic. There's also a definite trend for featuring green in arrangements these days. Green used to be considered a filler, but now it's a color unto itself -- and herbs offer beautiful variations of green.'' The country homespun look of herb bouquets, however, doesn't make them any less expensive: herb nosegays from Avi Adler start at $350. On the bright side, after the wedding's over, you've got seasonings for a year's worth of pizza.</p>
        <p>Casting a Look of Love Without Crow's Feet</p>
        <p>In what may be the most brazen example  of matrimonial marketing, the Michelle Roth bridal salon has come out with Eye Dew (as in ''I do''), an eye cream specifically formulated to treat the skin surrounding the dewy eyes of brides ($27 for half an ounce). Based on the logic that stress can aggravate lines around the eyes -- and that weddings are highly stressful -- Eye Dew claims to moisturize and reduce those unattractive pre-ceremonial crows' feet and puffiness. Still, while the product is supposed to fight the effects of stress, it inadvertently creates a little of its own. Instructions on the label say only, ''Use as directed.'' Just the sort of lack of direction that could send a jittery bride right over the edge.</p>
        <p>Potions and Lotions, at a Click</p>
        <p>For the modern bride  who wants to be pampered without leaving the house, online beauty sites are offering wedding kits packed with beauty products for the big day. Lucky Chick's Blushing Bride kit, above, decorated with whirly graphics and the slogan ''Within every blushing bride a lucky chick inside,'' has two-ounce bottles of shower gel, body lotion, body mist and massage oil; a one-eighth-ounce pot of lip balm; and a nylon mesh bath sponge ($30 at www.Beauty.com). At www .Sephora.com, Demeter fragrances introduces its Virtual Toast set, top -- one-ounce bottles of Champagne Brut and Damask Rose Pick-Me-Up sprays ($30). And BeautyJungle.com (search for ''bride'') offers the Here Comes the Bride gift set by Philosophy: two ounces each of Real Purity facial cleanser, It's All in Your Head shampoo, Shear Splendor conditioner, Be Somebody body cream, Soul Owner exfoliating foot cream, Footnotes pumice foot scrub and Time on Your Hands conditioning hand cream; an ounce of Hope in a Jar facial moisturizer; and one Marry Me certificate. Priced at $45, it comes in a sleek aluminum tin -- today's cosmetics equivalent of the trousseau trunk.</p>
