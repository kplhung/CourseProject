        <p>MIDSUMMER in the Monadnock region of New Hampshire invites nostalgia. Long, gently rising two-lane blacktop roads wend their way through corridors of stately pines. Sunlight ricochets off lakes and ponds. The hum of mosquitoes fills the gathering dusk; thunder rumbles comfortably in the distance. The series of little towns nestled in the southwest corner of the state around Mount Monadnock seems untouched by the passage of time.</p>
        <p>Not that the area has been entirely spared the ugliness of suburban sprawl, and there are inevitable outcroppings of video outlets, chain stores and fast-food franchises. But the overriding impression is one of large stretches of forest, carved by rivers and streams and punctuated by small towns and villages. With water, mountains and forest, it is a paradise for hikers, cyclists and boaters. There are plenty of other diversions, including shops selling antiques, books and crafts, summer theater, art galleries and restaurants.</p>
        <p>The region is a large one, defined visually by the mountain, a rocky peak towering 3,165 feet above the surrounding plain. (''Monadnock,'' an Algonquin word translated as ''one who stands alone,'' has taken on a geologic meaning, and is used to describe mountains that have resisted erosion and stand isolated in a plain.)</p>
        <p>From the early 19th century on, writers, Thoreau among them, found inspiration in the mountain; it became a subject for a group of painters, including Abbott Handerson Thayer, that came to be known as the Dublin Colony, after the town of Dublin, N.H.</p>
        <p>The region embraces at least 19 towns, stretching north to Hillsborough, south to Rindge (near the Massachusetts border), west to Troy and east to Wilton. Many would also include the nearby city of Keene. On a short weekend last summer, my husband and I confined our explorations mainly to the towns of Fitzwilliam and Peterborough, with brief stops in Jaffrey, Troy and Dublin.</p>
        <p>Monadnock is said to be the most-climbed mountain in the United States (discounting those with an auto road or funicular). Monadnock State Park -- with headquarters in Jaffrey Center -- offers 40 miles of hiking trails, picnic areas and a campground. A  hike to the summit on a clear day affords a view of various points in all six New England states, including the Boston skyline and  Mount Mansfield, in Vermont.</p>
        <p>In addition to summit hikes, which require rock scrambling at the top, the park offers many relatively flat trails through the woods. There is kayaking and canoeing on Thorndike Pond, adjacent to the park. The Monadnock-Sunapee Trail starts at Monadnock and goes north 50 miles through rolling forest and small towns, sometimes along graveled roads, to Mount Sunapee.</p>
        <p>A less ambitious outing also has its rewards: Little Monadnock, in Fitzwilliam, is a smaller peak (1,883 feet), with a moderately steep path through thick woods that offers a somewhat challenging hike. Several hikers I saw wearing high-heeled sandals had no visible trouble gaining the summit, however, though stouter footwear is certainly recommended. The rocky top affords a terrific view of the peak's larger relative, plus a lovely panorama, and the round trip can be done in under two hours.</p>
        <p>Little Monadnock, in Rhododendron State Park, is noted for its 16 acres of rhododendrons, claimed as the largest and most vigorous stand north of the Alleghenies and east of the Mississippi. Last year's bloom, because of inhospitable weather, was less than awe-inspiring -- I counted perhaps a dozen at the height of the bloom (usually around July 10). Park rangers, however, say that all signs point to the usual spectacular display for this summer. The park also has a wide, graveled wheelchair-accessible trail, the Rhododendron Loop, six-tenths of a mile.</p>
        <p>There are at least a dozen other state parks, state forest preserves and natural areas in the region, as well as many established hiking trails. Friends who live there recommend the Wapack, a 21-mile ridgeline trail that parallels the Sunapee Trail and extends from Greenfield, N.H., to Mount Watatic in Ashburnham, Mass. Gap Mountain, in Troy, offers a short, vertical hike that rewards the climber with wonderful views; ask at Monadnock State Park for directions to the trailhead. (A good place to pick up a picnic is Gap Mountain Breads in Troy.)</p>
        <p>Also in Troy is the Inn at East Hill Farm, a family resort offering just about anything except ocean frontage: two outdoor pools, an indoor pool, whirlpool, wading pool, lake beach, tennis, boating, fishing, mountain climbing, children's recreation program, pony rides, water-skiing and, for an extra fee, horseback riding and a sauna. Children can also collect eggs from the resident chickens and help milk cows.</p>
        <p>OUR stay began at the Fitzwilliam Inn, a rambling, generously porched and chimneyed building dating from 1804, situated on a spruce little village green. The inn has an air of worn gentility, much as one imagines 19th-century boarding houses or stagecoach stops.</p>
        <p>Our room, at $70 double occupancy, was large, had painted wood floors and was furnished with two beds, two bureaus and three wooden chairs (one of them a rocker). Four large windows opened onto the street, the summer air circulated by a cooling fan. There were no keys for the doors. The dinner menu was New England vintage 1960's -- broiled scrod and French onion soup. A visit last winter found much papering and painting going on in the common areas downstairs, and the innkeepers were planning to fix up the rooms as well; but one hopes that the bygone feel of the place is not lost in the improvements.</p>
        <p>What will keep us returning to Fitzwilliam is Rainy Day Books, presided over by a sort of Jessica Tandy-Hume Cronyn couple, Frank and Lucia Bequaert. I cannot imagine leaving the place without at least one purchase: mine was Imogene Wolcott's ''New England Yankee Cook Book,'' for $14. The Bequaerts -- whose collection includes some 30,000 used and antiquarian books and a good selection of old prints and maps -- specialize in several areas, including royalty, broadcasting and the history of technology. The shop is open from early April through mid-November.</p>
        <p>In Jaffrey Center, I found the grave of Willa Cather, who used to visit the area, in a small cemetery next to the starkly impressive Old Meeting House, the headstone inscribed with words from ''My Antonia'': ''. . . that is happiness, to be dissolved into something complete and great.'' The cemetery also contains the grave of one of Jaffrey's most revered citizens, Amos Fortune. ''Born free in Africa,'' reads his headstone, ''a slave in America, he purchased liberty, professed Christianity, lived reputably, and died hopefully, November 17 1901 aet. 91.'' The Amos Fortune Forum, named in his honor, is host to a series of free lectures at the Old Meeting House each summer, on subjects ranging  from local history to Islamic culture.</p>
        <p>There is also a gravestone with the best inscription I've ever encountered; it belongs to Sarah Averill, who died at the age of ''89 yrs 5 mos, 5 days,'' and reads: ''She done all she could.'' I was unable to find out anything else about her, but left thinking I would have liked her. A map of the gravesites is hung on the wall of a shed adjacent to the Meeting House, and can also be obtained from the public library downtown. Jaffrey is known for its annual Festival of Fireworks -- Aug. 19 this year (rain date: Aug. 20) -- which attracts tens of thousands of visitors.</p>
        <p>Peterborough, the hub of the region, offers the most for the day-tripper or weekend visitor. Home to the MacDowell Colony, host to artists from all over the world, this town of 5,800 has a remarkably lively and urbane air. I lived in the area in the late 70's, when the Peterboro Diner, as far as I could tell, was the only attraction in town. The renaissance since then is remarkable.</p>
        <p>Boutiques, antique shops, galleries and restaurants abound. The red brick architecture, the hallmark of the New England mill town, has been maintained and refurbished, and many small businesses have opened. The stately Unitarian Church is home to the Lyceum, a Sunday morning lecture series held each summer.  Other buildings of note are the Town Hall, modeled on Boston's Faneuil Hall, and the library, said to be the oldest tax-supported municipal library in continuous use in the United States (established in 1833).</p>
        <p>I found Twelve Pine -- a favorite restaurant from a previous visit several years ago -- moved to a spacious former railroad warehouse on Depot Square; and the menu has grown commensurately. The restaurant offers an array of homemade foods, breads, produce, fresh flowers and a coffee bar, with cafe seating and take-out as well. At Aesop's Tables, a cute eating spot in the popular Toadstool Bookshop, there are homemade soups and sandwiches, breakfast pastries and coffee.</p>
        <p>A new riverfront park, with a picnic area, has been created at the confluence of the Nubanusit and the Contoocook rivers right behind the book store. And the Peterboro Diner, a classic, is still worth a stop. But for dinner, Acqua Bistro, which opened last June, is the spot. It has a spare, light interior and a menu featuring ''designer'' pizzas and generous entrees of meat, seafood and pastas.</p>
        <p>Depot Square also houses Peterborough Fine Art and the Sharon Arts Center. Peterborough Fine Art specializes in American (primarily New England) painters from 1850 to 1950, and furniture from the New Hampshire Furniture Masters Association in Concord, N.H. The Sharon Arts Center sells the work of New England artists and artisans.</p>
        <p>About three miles out of town is the barnboard complex that includes the regionally acclaimed Peterborough Players. This year's line-up includes Anthony Shaffer's ''Sleuth,'' ''The Philanderer'' by George Bernard Shaw and ''Our Town,'' starring Mary Beth Hurt and James Whitmore. Plays for children are staged by the Players' Second Company, which features apprentices and interns, and include ''Stuart Little'' and ''Pirates in the Gazebo.''</p>
        <p>The MacDowell Colony, set on over 400 acres just minutes from downtown, is open to the public one day a year, on Medal Day, when the Edward MacDowell Medal (named after the composer, who summered in Peterborough) is given to a prominent artist in recognition of lifetime achievement. Past recipients have included John Updike, I.M. Pei and Ellsworth Kelly. Resident artists also open their studios on this day. Medal Day, which will honor the California composer Lou Harrison this year, is set for Aug. 20.</p>
        <p>Antiques stores abound in the region. Old England Enterprises, in Fitzwilliam, features British antiques from the 18th and 19th centuries and Victorian English linens and lace, along with artifacts from India.  Seaver/McLellan Antiques in Dublin  has 6,000 square feet of space stuffed with antiques and antiquities, which, on my visit, included a two-handled pot from ancient Greece and an English Regency sofa table.</p>
        <p>Dublin is probably best known as the home of Yankee magazine and The Old Farmer's Almanac, in their rustic red, barn-like buildings in the center of town. This year, Dublin Days -- a day of barbecue, crafts booths, and children's activities -- is set for July 22 (rain date July 23).</p>
        <p>My advice to the traveler, however, is not to load up the calendar with events but to simply wander around this beautiful countryside. When I lived there, in my 20's, I found it dull -- all those trees, all that water, those pokey little towns and those seemingly endless two-lane roads. The intervening years have brought some remarkable changes, and lots more to occupy the traveler. But it is those trees, that water, the pokey little villages and the seemingly  endless two-lane roads that bring  me back.</p>

        <p>Logistics</p>
        <p>Peterborough is around 75 miles from Boston, and about 230 from New York City.</p>
