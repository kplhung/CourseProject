        <p>IT'S not Hampton Bays most people think of when they discuss ''the Hamptons,'' nor is Tumbleweeds Texas Barbecue on their mind when they extol the virtues of Hamptons restaurants.</p>
        <p>Tumbleweeds is a contrarian.

        <p>IT'S not Hampton Bays most people think of when they discuss ''the Hamptons,'' nor is Tumbleweeds Texas Barbecue on their mind when they extol the virtues of Hamptons restaurants.</p>
        <p>Tumbleweeds is a contrarian. Although chic-chic glamour palaces in Southampton and East Hampton serve light, creative, cutting-edge concoctions that emphasize seafood, vegetables and fruits, Tumbleweeds has, since it opened late last year, been turning out huge portions of smoky, fat-filled, high-calorie and high-cholesterol ribs, brisket, pork and sausage for delighted barbecue fans.</p>
        <p>Tumbleweeds, at 174 East Montauk Highway (631-728-0808), may be the only restaurant in the Hamptons without salmon (or fish of any kind), nor is there a green vegetable to speak of (steer clear of the vinegar-doused iceberg lettuce salad).</p>
        <p>The Texas State flags in front of this down-home spot and the saddles, spittoons, cowboy hats, boots, lassoes, chaps and stirrups inside on the barroom wall tell the story. This is not the place to order cappuccino;  someone at my table did and the waitress had to fight off hysterical laughter. Rather, the focus is on the barbecue pit or, more accurately, on two large, in-the-wall smoker ovens that together rotate 2,500 pounds of meat Ferris wheel-style through the hot, dense smoke for 4 to 18 hours.  That might not be a big deal in Texas where barbecue joints abound and beef, pork and poultry are sometimes cooked for as long as 35 hours, but Nassau-Suffolk is a barbecue wasteland where meat and smoke rarely meet.</p>
        <p>As a rule, ribs are routinely cooked on a grill and slathered with some bottled barbecue sauce just before being served. By contrast, the slow cooking over hickory and fruit woods at Tumbleweeds results in a delicious marriage of smoke, meat, dry rubs and sauces.</p>
        <p>The weight of the meat on the hefty, crusty fat-trimmed Lundy ribs ($12.95) from North Carolina often causes the soft beef to fall from the bone. Crisp skinned chicken ($12.95), with mouth-watering, moist white as well as dark meat, and the not too smoky, pulled pork ($12.95) spouting with juice will have you licking your manicured fingers. Only the slightly dry brisket ($12.95) falls a little short of true Texas transcendental. All four of these platters from the pit, as well as a super sampler for two ($24.95), are escorted by fresh, broadly cut homemade coleslaw, molasses-laced bowls of tiny baked beans that even bean haters enjoyed and tangy tomato-based sauce that's lively but not hot or thick.</p>
        <p>Although beef ribs are a mainstay at Texas barbecue hangouts, many of the legendary ones, including Angelo's in Fort Worth and Hammond's in Glen Rose, also offer smoky pork ribs. They would be a welcome addition to Tumbleweeds limited (four) from-the-pit possibilities.</p>
        <p>Thin-sliced, tender, carved ham ($9.95), accompanied by a robust mustard sauce and a big batch of super-fat skins-on steak fries, will appeal to those who want taste without a bold smoky overlay. Not nearly as subtle is the big, spicy flavor bang generated by the Yankee bean chili ($4.95 and $3.50). It lives in your mouth for a few minutes and in your memory for even longer. The smoked brisket sandwich ($5.50 or $7.95 with fries and coleslaw) on a hero-sized roll is improved by covering the meat with plenty of that tangy barbecue sauce.</p>
        <p>Three side dishes ($2.95) -- an interesting, though slightly dry potato salad (egg bits, onions, green peppers), a creamy macaroni salad free of preservatives and moist squares of jalapeno-flecked corn bread -- are available on the a la carte menu.  Jalapeno poppers ($4), which are  breaded peppers (without their incendiary seeds) stuffed with cheddar cheese and deep fried, sound more exciting than they taste, but a ton of moist, somewhat hot, somewhat sweet farmer's sausage ($4.50) in broth is a savory starter that can feed four.</p>
        <p>Homemade whipped cream appears with all desserts ($4 and $5), the best of which is warm apple pie with a delicate crust and ripe fruit. A fluffy, chocolate bread pudding was marred by rubbery ribbons of crust, and rice pudding was unexciting.  More impressive by far is the beginning of the meal when complementary fresh, runny, home-made salsa (jalapeno, tomato, lime, cayenne and cilantro) comes with warm chips.</p>
        <p>Tumbleweeds is enough of a funky, one-of-a-kind spot to qualify as an authentic down-and-dirty barbecue.  Patrons step down into it. The very plain dining area is barnlike, the neon signs in the window are sufficiently garish, the waitresses are homey-nice and they keep the very necessary napkins and cold water coming. All of which is already attracting an enthusiastic, blue-collar crowd and might even entice some non-conformists from the tonier East to cross the Shinnecock Canal before the season ends.</p>
        <p>Openings</p>
        <p>The 150-seat Eastern Strawberry Chinese Buffet, at 115 Soundview Market Place in Port Washington (516-883-8150), opened in late March.  It offers more than 48 hot dishes and a cold buffet of Chinese, Japanese, Italian and American dishes. Its owners plan to open the Village Chinese Buffet on Route 110 in Huntington in the near future.</p>
        <p>The Happy Wok, a Japanese-Chinese sit-down-takeout spot, opened at 780 Fort Salonga Road (Route 25A) in Northport (631-754-1688) in April. Its owner, Jennifer Liu, who also operates the Mid China Restaurant in Commack, is offering an extensive menu of Chinese dishes (all priced under $10) and a smaller Japanese bill of fare that tops out at $14.95 (sushi and sashimi combo or teriyaki seafood special).</p>
