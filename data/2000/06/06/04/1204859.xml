        <p>On a recent drizzly Saturday morning, a group of nine girls from New York City's poorer neighborhoods walked over soil so soft it sank under their footsteps. Unlike the hard asphalt and caked dirt in the city's empty lots, the girls discovered, this ground was ripe with fertility. The girls were participating in a program run by the Fresh Air Fund, a nonprofit agency that provides summer camp vacations to  needy children from New York City.</p>
        <p>The weekend program, in its first year, was intended to get campers more involved year-round so they would form a stronger bond with the camps and with one another, agency officials said.</p>
        <p>Twenty-seven girls who attend Camp Anita Bliss Coler, one of the agency's five camps in Fishkill, N.Y., returned there after last summer's group was divided in two. Each group of girls, ages 9 to 12, met once in the fall and once in the spring.</p>
        <p>They planted sweet corn, zucchini and beans. But they also got a chance to start friendships with other campers and to enjoy the peaceful garden and surrounding woods.</p>
        <p>Corinthia Jacobs, a 10-year-old from East New York, Brooklyn, tried to get some of that soft earth off her shoes by kicking a heavy rock.</p>
        <p>''You're trying to move the rock?'' asked Sade Frazier, also 10, who lives on Teller Avenue in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>''I'm swiping off this mud,'' Corinthia responded. But the brief exchange created a question in the girls' minds: could they move the rock if they wanted to?</p>
        <p>After a few minutes of organizing, Sade, Corinthia and their friends Kamille McIntosh-Brown and Joy Holloway counted, ''One, two, three,'' and used the leverage of their hoes and rakes to move the rock.</p>
        <p>Someone let out a shriek as the formerly immovable rock gave way. ''Girl power!'' Corinthia shouted.</p>
        <p>''The more contact you have with children, the more impact you can have with them,'' said Bev McEntarfer, the director of the camp. ''We want them to have more contact with positive role models throughout the year.''</p>
        <p>The program is based in part on the success of the Fresh Air Fund's Career Awareness Program, which invites campers back year after year to prepare them for the future. ''These kids are doing better in school and sort of in life in general,'' Ms. McEntarfer said. ''We wanted to extend that experience to other campers.''</p>
        <p>Besides planting the garden, the girls built a scarecrow. They also went on a hike in the woods, during which they were blindfolded and had to navigate a route delineated by a length of rope. They went on to an arts and crafts session, where many made address books.</p>
        <p>''There was a lot of concern about keeping in touch, because some of them realized they won't be seeing each other until next fall when this program starts again,'' Ms. McEntarfer said.</p>
        <p>After moving the rock, the girls had to get back to the work of planting the garden, which they will visit again later in the summer to see the results of their labor.</p>
        <p>Tim Stanley, the farm's director, who helped teach the girls about Native American farming techniques, asked several of them to dig up a row of soil with some hand tools, and he asked a second group to pick out all the weeds that turned up in the row.</p>
        <p>After a few minutes, Corinthia found a plant she liked.</p>
        <p>''Isn't this pretty?'' she asked, showing the little green plant to Mr. Stanley.</p>
        <p>''Yeah, it's pretty,'' he said, ''but . . . ''</p>
        <p>''It's a weed,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Families who wish to inquire about registering their children for a Fresh Air Fund summer vacation may call (800) 367-0003 or visit the Web site www.freshair.org. Tax-deductible contributions may be sent (checks only) to the Fresh Air Fund, 1040 Avenue of the Americas, New York, N.Y. 10018.</p>
