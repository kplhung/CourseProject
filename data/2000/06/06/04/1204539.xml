        <p>From June 16 through July 2, the medieval city of Cahors in the Lot region of France, north of Toulouse, swings into summer with its annual Printemps de Cahors arts festival. This avant-garde event attracted 100,000 visitors in 1999.</p>
        <p>The theme for the 2000 festival is ''Sensitive,'' but Cahors, famed for its rough-edged black wine, has inspired 32 international artists to import a defiantly earthy vintage of videos, photo exhibits, installations and performance art to this quiet town. On June 16, 17, 23 and 24, the exhibitions -- emphasizing sensation and emotion rather than reason -- will be open till 1 a.m., with music and dance events integrated with lighting displays and special effects.</p>

        <p>From June 16 through July 2, the medieval city of Cahors in the Lot region of France, north of Toulouse, swings into summer with its annual Printemps de Cahors arts festival. This avant-garde event attracted 100,000 visitors in 1999.</p>
        <p>The theme for the 2000 festival is ''Sensitive,'' but Cahors, famed for its rough-edged black wine, has inspired 32 international artists to import a defiantly earthy vintage of videos, photo exhibits, installations and performance art to this quiet town. On June 16, 17, 23 and 24, the exhibitions -- emphasizing sensation and emotion rather than reason -- will be open till 1 a.m., with music and dance events integrated with lighting displays and special effects.</p>
        <p>With the historic sites of Cahors transformed into impromptu indoor and outdoor galleries, visitors will encounter fanciful egg-tipped cacti created by the Belgian sculptor Michel Francois and an imaginary hockey match installed by Roderick Buchanan of Scotland. The French artist Fabrice Hybert will introduce ''Arbres Fruitiers dans la Ville,'' which replaces the city's existing flora with fruit trees.</p>
        <p>Zoe Leonard, a New York photographer, is presenting pictures where tree foliage has been replaced by plastic shopping bags, while Via Lewandowsky of Germany showcases his ''Never Been There'' series of computer-generated photographs suggesting idealized African landscapes. The composer Simon Fisher Turner, the choreographer Olivia Granville and the Compagnie EDNA dance ensemble will perform.</p>
        <p>All events are free. Information: (33-5) 65.53.94.75 and www.printempsdecahors .com.</p>
