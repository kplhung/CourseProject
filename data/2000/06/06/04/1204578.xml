        <p>Somewhere along the way, A. R. Gurney [''What's Wrong With the Tonys? A Lot,'' May 21] seems to have lost sight of his mission as a Tony nominator and instead has chosen to lobby for his personal agenda, while using his former nominator status as a credential.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Somewhere along the way, A. R. Gurney [''What's Wrong With the Tonys? A Lot,'' May 21] seems to have lost sight of his mission as a Tony nominator and instead has chosen to lobby for his personal agenda, while using his former nominator status as a credential.</p>
        <p>Notwithstanding Mr. Gurney's contention, at no time are the nominators asked to give any consideration whatsoever to the Tony Awards television production, and they are certainly not expected to help create a television show. It is the television producers' responsibility to create a program that discloses the voters' choices in a format that satisfies the entertainment requirements of network television.</p>
        <p>During the 33 years that the American Theater Wing's Tony Awards have been on network television, no network executive has ever tried to force or even suggest a specific number of nominations in any category. CBS has carried the Tony telecast for the last 22 years with no stipulation that the entertainment be the nominated shows. Looking at the programs since they began reveals that often the nominated musicals were not used as the entertainment, despite Mr. Gurney's presumption that they are mandatory. This refutes his unwarranted accusation that the nominators may be forced to nominate shows from which the producers must select material in order to satisfy sponsors.</p>
        <p>If some of our nominators or voters have gone astray, it is they and not the networks who are doing a disservice to the integrity of the Tony Awards, and that is something that we at the American Theater Wing and the League of American Theaters and Producers will continue to monitor carefully. Thus far, we see no cause for alarm. Meanwhile, the networks remain staunch supporters of the awards without even a suggestion of interference with the process.</p>
        <p>We sincerely believe, like Mr. Gurney, that the Tony Awards are about excellence in the Broadway theater and that surely they would survive in his proposed scenario of an ''untelevised, congenial gathering of theater folk.'' But for now, there is no need to deprive millions of viewers of the opportunity to tune in to CBS and PBS to follow the Tony Awards merely because A. R. Gurney misinterpreted his role as a Tony nominator.</p>
        <p>ROY A. SOMLYO and JED BERNSTEIN  New York</p>
        <p>Mr. Somlyo, a former producer of the Tony Awards telecast, is president of the American Theater Wing; Mr. Bernstein is president of the League of American Theaters and Producers.</p>
        <p>A. R. Gurney replies:</p>
        <p>The Tony television deal hardly leads to the bald interference that Mr. Somlyo and Mr. Bernstein describe here. What happens is that nominators may be presented with four shows in a particular category, normally involving musicals, and are required to nominate them all, whether worthy or not. Abstentions are not allowed. Why? Presumably, because to nominate fewer might jeopardize the contractual commitment to CBS to produce so many musical ''entertainments.''</p>
        <p>As far as my agenda is concerned, I would hope that all of us can work toward the same one: namely, to honor the best work on the American stage during the course of the season. If the television arrangement is indeed so flexible, that is all the more reason for ''millions of viewers'' to see celebrated deserving work from theaters not necessarily designated as ''Broadway.''</p>
