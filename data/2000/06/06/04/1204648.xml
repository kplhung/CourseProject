        <p>So, there were nuclear tips on the Nikes, and that fact was not made plain to us. We are, I suppose, to be shocked and indignant.</p>
        <p>As if.</p>
        <p>As a boy in the 60's I was one of those who, from time to time with a school or Scout group, visited the Nike site in Lloyd Harbor, which your writer notes was not equipped with those warheads. That site was no more than a football toss or two from Lloyd Harbor School, where we learned to go under desks and hold our heads or line up in the hallway in the event of a nuclear holocaust.</p>
        <p>The fact that we were ground zero in the event of an attack, and that the world was nuclear, was not exactly unclear to us. And whether or not the missiles were nuclear-equipped did not, in my mind at least, did not signify much.</p>
        <p>It is of interest to me that the Nikes had nuclear warheads on them, to be sure. But we all felt threatened in those days, I think, by the general threat of nuclear war and our proximity to New York City.</p>
