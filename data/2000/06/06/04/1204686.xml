        <p>CENDRILLON  * [Rating: one star)  (212) 343-9012; 45 Mercer Street, between Broome and Grand Streets; $$; no smoking; all major credit cards; closed Mondays.</p>
        <p>How often do you find a restaurant named for the French ballet about Cinderella, specializing in Filipino food with a mainland Asian twist?  Appetizers at Cendrillon include squash soup with crab dumplings; Manila clams with black beans, leeks and shiitake mushrooms; and goat curry with rice pancakes. Main courses include salt-roasted duck with mango and tomatillo chutney with sauteed cellophane noodles; barbecued shrimp skewers with udon in red curry sauce; and black rice paella with crab, shrimp and Manila clams. (Review: 7/26/96)</p>
        <p>EIGHT MILE CREEK  ** [Rating: two stars]  (212) 431-4635; 240 Mulberry Creek, between Prince and Spring Streets; $$$; smoking at the bar; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>When a restaurant announces that it will be serving Australian cuisine, you expect good comic material, not good food, but the joke stops when the kangaroo salad arrives. Appetizers include yabby risotto with fresh soy bean and preserved lemon; warm oyster ''meat pie,'' with leeks, salsify and tarragon; and seared sushi-grade tuna over a salad of poached squid and seaweed noodles. Entrees include black sea bass with duck confit, mashed potatoes and black vinegar reduction; Australian lamb loin served over herbed polenta with maitake mushrooms; and mountain-pepper-roasted tomato with orzo, mousseron, sorrel and goat cheese. (Review: 1/12/00)</p>
        <p>FRONTIERE  * [Rating: one star]  (212) 387-0898; 199 Prince Street, between Sullivan and Macdougal Streets; $$$; no smoking; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>It is hard to imagine a cozier place than this brick-walled, open-front bistro, and it is usually filled with regular clients. Starters include grilled wild mushroom salad with warm potatoes and goat cheese; warm bacon and leek tart with Roquefort cheese; and seared, spice-crusted yellowfin tuna with avocado pico de gallo, arugula and chipotle vinaigrette. Entrees include white bean ravioli with asparagus, tomato and balsamic brown butter; sea scallop and wild mushroom risotto with chives, truffle oil and Parmesan; rack of lamb with mashed potatoes, ratatouille and herb lamb jus; and pan-roasted loin of pork medallion with spicy rabe, gratin dauphinoise and red wine sauce. (Review: 10/27/ 95)</p>
        <p>PROVENCE  * [Rating: one star]  (212) 475-7500; 38 Macdougal Street, between Houston and Prince Streets; $$$; smoking at the bar; American Express only.</p>
        <p>The atmosphere at Provence, with its long bar, subdued colors and arrangements of dried flowers, is charming and romantic. Appetizers include chickpea tempura of small fish and vegetables; tuna and fish carpaccio, passion fruit vinaigrette; and mussels, shallots, white wine, fresh herbs and saffron. Entrees include roasted duck, sweet and sour sauce and wild mushroom ravioli; pan-seared cod, tomato fondue, olives and basil; and breaded skate filet, spring vegetables, red wine, duck jus and kumquat sauce. (Review: 1/14/98)</p>
        <p>QUILTY'S  ** [Rating: two stars]  (212) 254-1260; 177 Prince Street, between Thompson and Sullivan Streets; $$$; smoking section near bar; all major credit cards; no lunch on Mondays.</p>
        <p>This small and tastefully decorated restaurant is as spare and lovely as a traditional New England inn, but it is clamorous. Katy Sparks, the chef, has attracted an ardent following. Appetizers include wild freshwater mussels in a toasted garlic, saffron and basil broth with crispy polenta croutons; grilled baby artichokes with a lemon aioli, smoked red pepper vinaigrette and Parmesan-cumin crisps; and tamarind glazed squab on a spring garlic puree with a radish and mango salsa.  Main courses include pancetta-wrapped pork tenderloin in a rhubarb marinade with smashed sweet potatoes and sugar snap peas; braised rabbit with morels, fava beans and spring potatoes with sage; and diver sea scallops with caramelized fennel, panko-fried zucchini and a hibiscus-preserved lemon vinaigrette. (Review: 1/31/97)</p>
        <p>WOO LAE OAK  ** [Rating: two stars]  (212) 925-8200; 148 Mercer Street, between East Houston and Prince Streets; $$; smoking at the bar; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>This Korean restaurant has a smoothly concocted blend of traditional dishes, pan-Oriental crowd-pleasers like tempura and fresh creations with Korean names and Korean ingredients. Appetizers include tuna tartar served over sliced Korean pear; sizzling scallion pancake with shrimp and calamari; and sauteed beef and kimchi dumplings.  Main dishes include spicy tofu casserole served in a stone bowl; miso stew with pork and assorted vegetables; sashimi and vegetables served over steamed rice; and shrimp dumplings in a seasoned broth. Desserts include Korean pear rolls and creme brulee. (Review: 11/3/99)</p>
