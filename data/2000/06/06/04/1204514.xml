        <p>Near Zion National Park, Utah, April 26, 2000, Emilee and Michael Barnouin</p>
        <p>Emilee: ''I'm 6, practically 7. My mom saw the dead deer lying in the road. It was the fourth time I saw a dead thing. We touched it with a stick, and it didn't move. It was stinking and dirty. I guess deers can't have baths. I was pretending that I was a hunter shooting a gun, except it was just my hands. Well, you have to die. If you live and live and live, you'll get too old to eat. Then when you die, you go to heaven or to hell. God makes the choice.''</p>
        <p>Michael: ''I'm 4 1/2. The dead deer was very sad. The tongue was just sticking out there the whole time. It was gross -- but I wanted to touch it. It was very hard to see the dead deer through my mask, but I saw it fly up to heaven. I saw it going up and up and up.''</p>
