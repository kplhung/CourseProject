        <p>Given the constitutional protections that even hate speech enjoys, Jim Panos [''Stretching the Limits of Free Speech,'' Opinion, May 7] despairs of being able to counteract toxic messages attacking immigrants in the rudest language.</p>
        <p>Mr. Panos has no need to despair. He has already used his own free speech to counter the message. The answer to bad speech, in the words of Justice Brandeis, is not censorship but more speech.

        <p>Given the constitutional protections that even hate speech enjoys, Jim Panos [''Stretching the Limits of Free Speech,'' Opinion, May 7] despairs of being able to counteract toxic messages attacking immigrants in the rudest language.</p>
        <p>Mr. Panos has no need to despair. He has already used his own free speech to counter the message. The answer to bad speech, in the words of Justice Brandeis, is not censorship but more speech. In this case, Mr. Panos could have magnified the effectiveness of his protest by telling us the name the contractor who displayed the message so people who detest such racism could tell him so.</p>
        <p>As for the ''raw prejudice'' the message delivers to children, Mr. Panos is right to worry, but beyond worry is the chance to turn hate speech into a lesson. Nothing works better to teach children about bigotry than a real-life confrontation.</p>
        <p>In his First Inaugural Address, Thomas Jefferson warned that those who wished to change our system of government should ''stand undisturbed as monuments of the safety with which error of opinion may be tolerated where reason is left free to combat it.'' Combat is the operative word, not censor.</p>
