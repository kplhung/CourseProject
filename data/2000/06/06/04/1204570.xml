        <p>I'VE swept the plate,'' said Eileen Heckart during a telephone conversation from her home in Norwalk.</p>
        <p>The most honored actress of the New York theater season was reeling off the names of the awards lavished on her performance in ''The Waverly Gallery,'' though in truth two of them pay homage to her life in the theater.

        <p>I'VE swept the plate,'' said Eileen Heckart during a telephone conversation from her home in Norwalk.</p>
        <p>The most honored actress of the New York theater season was reeling off the names of the awards lavished on her performance in ''The Waverly Gallery,'' though in truth two of them pay homage to her life in the theater. At No. 7, she stopped counting. That one, to be bestowed at Radio City Music Hall tonight, is the Tony, commonly known as Broadway's equivalent to the Oscar.</p>
        <p>But wait.</p>
        <p>Ms. Heckart's indelible performance was given Off Broadway, and the Tony Award eligibility rules amazingly go on disallowing that designation (which is based on seating capacity, not location). Yet, inarguably, most of the brainiest and innovative plays and musicals in New York are produced in just those unacknowledged theaters. While all visionary directors proclaim a theater of inclusion, the Tonys go on signifying theater of exclusion.</p>
        <p>''Broadway used to be the originator of American theater,'' said Arthur Miller, in a telephone conversation from his home in Roxbury. ''It's lost that,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''Thriving serious theater on Broadway is a contradiction in terms,'' Mr. Miller added.</p>
        <p>None of tonight's nominations for best play originated on Broadway -- and two of them are not new.</p>
        <p>Mr. Miller is twice nominated for Tonys tonight, in the best play and best revival categories. Yet ''The Ride Down Mt. Morgan,'' which is being promoted as a new play, opened in London 10 years ago, and it was produced by the Williamstown Theater Festival in Massachusetts and by the Public Theater in downtown Manhattan in revised versions. Mr. Miller said his rewrites for the Broadway production were ''not inconsiderable.'' Soon, a third version of the play is to be published.</p>
        <p>And last summer's Williamstown production of Mr. Miller's 1968 play, ''The Price,'' went directly to Broadway. Now nominated for best revival, it was playing on the theater festival's main stage while ''The Waverly Gallery'' was on the Nikos Stage next door.</p>
        <p>''The Waverly Gallery'' closed after 10 weeks; ''The Price,'' after 14. Mr. Miller would correct that sentence. ''It didn't close,'' he said. ''It was closed.'' He was referring to one losing week. Practically speaking, that amounts to an eviction notice, especially during a theater shortage.</p>
        <p>The Off Broadway theater movement, with its groundbreaking productions and introductions of great new stars had not yet emerged when the Tonys were first presented 54 years ago. The awards have changed for the bigger, but not for the better. Now the centerpiece of a star-driven nationally televised program, the awards accentuate the business of show business. For serious theatergoers, that is not accentuating the positive.</p>
        <p>Oddly, through such additional categories as excellence in theater (Ms. Heckart) and a special Tony (Sylvia Herscher, a trustee on the board of Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam for 24 years), this year's Tonys are indirectly paying tribute to exemplars of a vanished Broadway theater, many with significant connections to Connecticut.</p>
        <p>Add Mr. Miller's two nominations in the oldest categories and it is impossible to ignore a reverence for sheer resilience in a youth-obsessed dumbed-down culture where going to the Broadway theater has taken on -- in Mr. Miller's words -- ''an element of partygoing'' that involves ''a remote part of the brain.''</p>
        <p>Octogenarians all, Ms. Heckart, at 81, is the youngest. Mr. Miller turns 85 in October and Ms. Herscher said she's ''pushing 87.''</p>
        <p>Given rich memories of what she called ''once upon a time'' theater, Ms. Herscher's responses are often preceded with the command, ''Don't get me started,'' when asked about the state of Broadway, especially musicals.</p>
        <p>''I'm sad about what's happening in musical theater today,'' bemoaned Ms. Herscher, who has been living in Manhattan throughout her 51-year career in music publishing, publicity, theater management and artists' representative.</p>
        <p>''I just schlepped up there,'' said Ms. Herscher of her involvement with Goodspeed Opera in East Haddam, which has won two special Tonys over the years. And Goodspeed first produced 10 fully staged musical revivals of the 21 that have been performed in concert during seven years of the terrific Encores series at City Center in Manhattan. Generally regarded as Off Broadway, Encores is being awarded a special Tony tonight.</p>
        <p>''Musicals have become a corporate enterprise,'' Ms. Herscher went on. ''They haven't been able to define themselves; there is no passion.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Miller -- who wrote ''Death of a Salesman'' in the first Roxbury house he bought in 1947, and goes on writing in the converted farmhouse where he has been living since 1955 -- talked about the difference between regional theater and Broadway audiences. ''There is a communal feeling outside of New York,'' he said. ''The audiences are less aggressive.'' Regional theater feeds the New York theater, Mr. Miller agreed. ''It used to be the other way around,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''On Broadway,'' Mr. Miller said, ''To be blunt, it's all about money. It was always about money, more or less, but the balance is gone. There used to be all those crazy people who risked everything to put on something they loved, plays that were not likely to make money. Now it's the regional theater that's keeping theater alive.''</p>
        <p>Still wondering about the shows that sell, Ms. Heckert agreed, ''It all comes down to money.''</p>
        <p>''The connotation of Broadway was that it must be the best. Now who can afford it?'' said Ms. Heckart, who lived in New Canaan for 34 years before moving to Norwalk six years ago.</p>
        <p>''And people don't want to think,'' she continued, ''but in Williamstown, the audiences were stunned, amazed. In New York, people are no longer conditioned to going to the theater. You never used to hear them talk during a performance. Now they talk.''</p>
        <p>But plays will somehow survive, the three illustrious theater veterans agree. ''Things will turn around again,'' Ms. Heckart said. ''Greed is a phase.''</p>
        <p>''It's cyclical,'' Ms. Herscher said. ''It'll come back. And I have a wonderful new musical to tell you about.'' The working title is ''Haunted''; that'll do for a teaser.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Miller is working on a new play: ''It's basically a comedy, maybe a tragicomedy. There is always something to despair of,'' he said. ''But there is a next step on the agenda of how to support the theater on more than sheer commercial values. Lost causes get formed again. I just don't expect it to happen in my lifetime.</p>
