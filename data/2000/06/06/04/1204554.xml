        <p>HIS tale must be told, and though Arthur Kipps is determined to tell it, he knows he will tell it badly.</p>
        <p>How's this for a playwright's neat invention? Have Kipps, the long-winded solicitor (as in lawyer), hire an actor who knows how to be a director. That way Kipps will pick up a few oratorical pointers, though he intends to keep it all in the family, and perhaps invite some friends in for an evening of storytelling.</p>
        <p>The actor, who has bigger things in mind, is thinking about theater. Not just public speaking, but performing, and that means phrasing, presence, poise, pace.</p>
        <p>''I become you,'' he commands, and the actor's instinct takes over. He will recast the story as a play. The solicitor will have six roles, all in the supporting category, and the actor, knowing that the art of storytelling and the artifice of theater are one, will be narrator as star, not to mention playwright and director.</p>
        <p>The story-play is ''The Woman in Black,'' which is to begin its 12th year in London on Wednesday. Like Dame Agatha Christie's ''Mousetrap,'' which is 26 years old, it is a tourist attraction, but the professional theater in New York doesn't care. Like numerous English sex farces that have flopped on Broadway, some English savories don't travel.</p>
        <p>Not that many producers haven't tried to import Stephen Mallatrat's adaptation of Susan Hill's novel, but investors didn't care. So ''The Woman in Black'' is relegated to an occasional stock production. Seekers of theater curios may wish to make haste to Bay Street Theater here for what is considerably more than a mere stock staging.</p>
        <p>Against the marvelous clutter of Michael McCarty's set design -- a collage of old trunks, theater seats, slanted picture frames, suspended chairs and a sled, chandeliers and cherubs and boxes of old theater books -- a ghost story, ''just the thing for Christmas Eve,'' is played out. No matter that the stage is just a stage strewn with dusty props, the real setting, the eerie marshland of ''a strange part of the world,'' is felt.</p>
        <p>In a primer to the solicitor (Josef Sommer), the actor (Jason Butler Harner) demonstrates how theater of the imagination works. Mr. Sommers's initial tentativeness reappears too often, but he's a very fine actor, and he'll come round. Mr. Hamer's wily performance carries the assurance that a teacher and a director are synonymous, and that a teacher must be a performer, too.</p>
        <p>Only two actors, yes, but what about more than 100 light cues? Shifts from dark to darker are dramatic enough, but when the audience is plunged into total darkness, it's really goosebump time. You can hear the sea mist, as well as, far less subtly, the sounds of rough seas, footsteps and screams, and spookiest of all, the echoing whispers of a mystery woman. For mood, credit the designers Brian Nason (lighting) and Randall Freed (sound). And the director Leonard Foglia is expert at thoroughly engaging the audience's evocation of image and illusion.</p>
        <p>Putting a slew of the solicitor's descriptive words together -- haunting, evil, horror, tragedy, fear, anger, grief and revenge -- is what ''The Woman in Black'' is about. Surely, you don't expect to hear more. Even tourists don't always tell. Besides, even though the solicitor tries to make it all seem complicated, the novel from which the play is adapted is commonly found on bookshelves for young readers. It is sufficient to say that at Bay Street, it is Christmas Eve in June, and the sensory pleasures of a retro horror story can be relished before the fireplace of your mind.</p>
        <p>''The Woman in Black'' at Bay Street Theater, on the Long Wharf, Sag Harbor. Runs through next Sunday. Ticket information: (631) 725-9500.</p>
