        <p>BY a margin of almost 2 to 1, the 26 speakers at the City Planning Commission hearing last month offered their support for a zoning proposal that would reshape development, neighborhood character and architectural innovation in every corner of New York.</p>
        <p>But that consensus in favor of the plan  may have been misleading. Several fathoms below the level of public review, a battle is being fought over the proposal, called the Unified Bulk Program, which is to go to the City Council later this year. Though no one predicts that the measure is headed toward defeat, it faces high hurdles. The debate over key aspects of the rezoning package is believed to be going on within the Giuliani administration itself.</p>
        <p>Asked on Thursday whether the Unified Bulk Program had the unqualified support of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Deputy Mayor Anthony P. Coles replied simply, ''The mayor has an open mind.''</p>
        <p>As proposed by Joseph B. Rose, the chairman of the City Planning Commission and the director of the City Planning Department, the Unified Bulk Program would be the most thorough revision to zoning rules since they were entirely rewritten 40 years ago. These are some of  the provisions of the program:</p>
        <p>*It would impose height limits for the first time in neighborhoods citywide.</p>
        <p>*It would effectively restrict transfer of development rights.</p>
        <p>*It would eliminate bonuses for plazas at new apartment towers.</p>
        <p>*It would create a review panel that could recommend waiving restrictions in the interest of better design.</p>
        <p>*And it would eliminate complex zoning formulas that are understood only by a few technicians.</p>
        <p>Leaders of the real estate industry do not like the proposal and are making their displeasure known through public testimony and private communiques to politicians. They have a formidable ally in nonprofit institutions that fear new limits on their ability to transfer development rights, known as air rights, or to build what the law calls ''community facilities'': schools, hospitals, medical offices, nursing homes and houses of worship. The Greater New York Hospital Association has spoken out against the rezoning, and New York Presbyterian Hospital has raised concerns about a project it plans on West 165th Street. The Archdiocese of New York is in talks with city planners but will wait to comment until the matter comes before the City Council, a spokesman said.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, community planning boards, professional organizations like the American Institute of Architects and American Planning Association, and civic groups like the Municipal Art Society, Citizens Union and Civitas generally support the program, with qualifications. They see it as a rare opportunity to clear out a regulatory thicket that confounds the public and benefits only skilled manipulators.</p>
        <p>Though the proposal is often portrayed as a weapon against out-of-scale projects like the 856-foot Trump World Tower at First Avenue and 47th Street (the new height cap on that site would be 495 feet), the height limits would also be felt in medium-density districts, including residential zones known as R6, R7 and R8 that are mapped broadly through Brooklyn and the Bronx, the Lower East Side and Harlem, and the M1-5 manufacturing districts found in Lower Manhattan and elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Even as developers chafe at the proposed height limits of 55 to 140 feet in medium-density districts, neighborhood leaders are asking planners to draw the limits lower yet, to curb the liberally regulated community facilities and to tune zoning more closely to the prevailing physical context.</p>
        <p>All of which goes to a broader issue: Is the goal of a municipal land-use regimen to preserve the context of older neighborhoods or to provide enough flexibility that neighborhoods can change, and new neighborhoods can emerge, as economic and social trends dictate?</p>
        <p>Mr. Rose believes it is possible to do both, to ensure that a neighborhood's prevailing scale is not violated without straitjacketing design and development. Critics of his proposal believe it will stymie construction in areas that could most benefit from an infusion of new housing and usurp the architect's role, forcing the production of predictable, unwieldy building types.</p>
        <p>Reacting to comments and suggestions, city planners have proposed 76 possible modifications. In response, Mitchell J. Silver, the president of the New York chapter of the American Planning Association, told the commission at its May 23 hearing that ''on the whole, we're very enthusiastic about the direction of this proposal.''</p>
        <p>But the modifications do not go nearly far enough to persuade the Real Estate Board of New York to drop its blanket opposition.</p>
        <p>''This is still a totally objectionable proposal,'' Steven Spinola, the president of the Real Estate Board, said last week.</p>
        <p>Before the proposal is sent to the Council, it is likely to undergo further overhaul.</p>
        <p>Mayor Giuliani has made no public comment on the proposal, and a spokesman said on Wednesday that he would have none at this time. (In contrast, the mayor personally announced a rezoning of the theater district in December 1997 from the stage of the Lyceum Theater. It was adopted by the Council eight months later.)</p>
        <p>It may be that Mr. Giuliani is not ready to place his imprimatur on a proposal that is still very much in flux. As Mr. Coles said, ''City Planning is going through a process where it's listening to different constituencies.'' Or as opponents of the proposal hope, the mayor may seek to distance himself from the undertaking.</p>
        <p>AS to the proposal's prospects before the City Council, Speaker Peter F. Vallone was noncommittal. ''If this improves the quality of life for the people of the City of New York,'' he said on Wednesday, ''it will be very favorably reviewed.</p>
        <p>''If not, forget about it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rose has embarked on a difficult political maneuver, since the proposal enjoys qualified support from some quarters but faces implacable antagonism from others, all of this against a backdrop of relative public indifference.</p>
        <p>It is a paradox of land-use issues that the broader they are, the less popular attention they claim. The landmarking of a single building or the rezoning of several blocks might draw hundreds of people to City Hall, since the impact is so evident. But the rezoning of an entire city is a far more abstract undertaking. And the Unified Bulk Program is a long and complicated document that defies easy categorization.</p>
        <p>''I see in place dynamics that could result in defeat as well as success,'' said Councilman Walter L. McCaffrey of Queens, who heads the zoning subcommittee. ''There is strong support for this though, and I don't think that general principle should be trivialized in any way, shape or form. This is an aggressive, strong approach to the zoning text, and Joe does deserve credit for that.''</p>
        <p>Height limits are a key hurdle, according to Mitchell L. Moss, the director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New York University, as is the opposition of hospitals. ''Once landowners outside Manhattan are concerned about height limits,'' he said, ''the consensus becomes more fragile.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Spinola said the rules would foreclose the construction in medium-density R6, R7 and R8 zones of buildings ranging from 180 to 240 feet, or about 18 to 24 stories.</p>
        <p>''The city's future is going to be in neighborhoods that are emerging or neighborhoods we haven't even thought about,'' he said. ''To propose height limits of 55 or 75 or 140 feet just is counter to what New York City is all about.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Rose said that on normal sites in medium-density districts, ''there isn't that great a disparity between what is currently permitted and what the Unified Bulk Program would allow.''</p>
        <p>The New York State Association for Affordable Housing, an organization of for-profit builders, has appealed directly to Deputy Mayor Coles, saying in a letter dated May 25 that the Unified Bulk Program ''will impede new housing construction, thwart neighborhood revitalization and undermine the economic resurgence initiated by this administration.''</p>
        <p>Donald Capoccia, the founder and vice president of the builders' association and a principal in BFC Partners, said the rezoning would penalize those who had taken risks investing in areas like Upper Manhattan and the Lower East Side against the hope that there would one day be a market strong enough to attract large-scale, unsubsidized, private development.</p>
        <p>''Very big players are not interested in getting involved in small six-story and eight-story endeavors,'' he said. ''If they can't build big buildings, it just isn't worth their while. When you find neighborhoods reaching a critical mass where the next logical step is higher density, the Unified  Bulk Program stops this from happening.''</p>
        <p>But one person's critical mass is another's critical injury. In Kew Gardens, Queens, the relief promised from oversized development cannot come quickly enough, said Sylvia Hack, the chairwoman of Community Board 9, which includes Woodhaven, Richmond Hill and South Ozone Park.</p>
        <p>''We care desperately in Queens about the height of buildings,'' she said. ''There are tremendous monstrosities sitting on tiny lots that overwhelm the buildings around them.'' She said current controls are too complicated and too open to interpretation.</p>
        <p>''Unified Bulk sets a definite height,'' Ms. Hack said. ''It says, 'This building shall be 21 feet high.' You don't have to figure it out. You know where the top of the floor is supposed to be. We're so pleased that there is a height regulation.''</p>
        <p>The Unified Bulk Program would also change the rules governing building sites that straddle more than one zoning district, a perennially vexatious land-use issue. Ms. Hack praised the proposal for limiting the application of medium-density R7 controls on adjacent low-density R2 lots. ''That's a tremendous protection,'' she said. ''The sooner this gets passed, the better for us.''</p>
        <p>Another issue stirring the neighbors in medium-density zones involves community facilities, which can in some districts produce a structure with almost twice as much floor area as a residential buildings on the same site.</p>
        <p>Height limits directly affect institutions that need higher-than-normal floors for auditoriums, operating rooms, gymnasiums and the like. Mr. Rose has said that limits placed on community facilities, ''especially in a campus-type environment, may warrant greater latitude.''</p>
        <p>At the same time, neighbors worry about the potential disruption caused by such institutions. ''You buy a house next door to another family and suddenly you're living next door to 200 people,'' Ms. Hack said.</p>
        <p>Councilwoman June M. Eisland of the Bronx, who heads the Land Use Committee, said the failure of the proposal to tackle the community-facility issue in greater detail was ''one of the main sticking points.''</p>
        <p>Another element of the plan that has drawn skeptical reaction is the proposed design review panel, made up of seven members appointed by the planning director who would have ''knowledge and experience in the areas of architecture and urban design,'' in the language of the zoning amendment. This group could recommend waiving height limits, lot coverage requirements and setback rules for a building that ''exhibits superior design quality.''</p>
        <p>Bruce S. Fowle, co-chairman of the zoning task force for the New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects, told the commission on May 23 that the chapter had ''serious questions whether or not the proposed panel will encourage design excellence on a meaningful scale.'' Allowing that it might provide a greater opportunity for innovative design in unique situations, he urged city planners to adopt the program on a five-year test basis.</p>
        <p>It is possible, of course, that the whole idea of a design review panel could be withdrawn, although city planners might still try to devise a process under which aesthetic quality could be used as a criterion to allow the development of buildings that do not conform to standard zoning rules.</p>
        <p>Another serious point of contention is grandfathering; that is, just where will the cutoff be set between projects governed by the old and new zoning? Mr. Rose has said  that projects under construction would be unaffected. But what about a project that has not begun to dig foundations but has all of its building permits in place? Or a project that has just obtained its financing? Drawing this line will be a challenge.</p>
        <p>One significant obstacle seems to have been cleared. In January, city planners proposed a requirement that a tower occupy at least 33 percent of the merged zoning lot from which it draws air rights. This was intended to prevent the harvesting of air rights up and down a block and piling them on a single building site, as was done at Trump World Tower, which occupies only 13 percent of the merged zoning lot.</p>
        <p>Developers were understandably upset about this provision, but they were not alone in criticizing it. In April, the A.I.A. expressed concern that the result would be ''bulkier, poorly proportioned'' buildings that ''create darkness for more hours of the day; provide long, dark interior corridors and like many of the least desirable developments in the last several decades, will be characterless and flat-topped.''</p>
        <p>Since then, planners have proposed adjusting the minimum to 25 percent. ''It creates greater flexibility,'' Mr. Rose said. ''That's the essence of the proposal: to come up with a set of rules that are clear; that allow for as-of-right, economically viable development; that have some relationship to neighborhood scale; and that end the elaborate series of zoning manipulation, loopholes and inconsistency.''</p>
        <p>THE readjustment of the tower coverage provision was endorsed by the A.I.A. and the Municipal Art Society, which said it would ''allow the as-of-right construction of slimmer towers that allow more light and air to reach the street.'' Even Mr. Spinola of the Real Estate Board  said it was a ''meaningful change.''</p>
        <p>But he also said there had been no progress in resolving the board's objection to height limits in the medium-density R6, R7, R8 and M1-5 districts and the high-density M1-6 manufacturing district that is found around the Hudson Square area in Lower Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''There's little reason to believe that some kind of compromise is going to be worked out,'' Mr. Spinola said. ''That's not to say that one can't be worked out.''</p>
        <p>''I don't believe in taking on fights that are impossible to win,'' he said, ''so I believe there's a chance that this process will lead to its not being enacted. But on the other hand, it's probably an uphill battle.''</p>
        <p>That battle is waged on many fronts. According to records compiled by the New York City Campaign Finance Board, Mr. Vallone, a potential mayoral candidate, has received $72,125 from 25 members of the board of governors of the Real Estate Board since 1999. Eight of these contributors, including Bernard H. Mendik, the chairman of the Real Estate Board, gave $4,500, the maximum permitted for a citywide contest under the public financing law.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spinola said contributions do not ''buy us anything other than the ability to have a direct conversation and make our point.''</p>
        <p>And Mr. Vallone dismissed the notion that any contribution -- much less such small contributions -- could affect a vote. ''No respectable elected official is going to be influenced solely by campaign contributions,'' he said. Moreover, he added, he hears ''a lot of conflicting real estate opinions.''</p>
