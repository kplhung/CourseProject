        <p>A day after their coach criticized them pointedly and publicly, the Devils' top line responded. Jason Arnott, Patrik Elias and Petr Sykora accounted for both goals and took 13 shots to pace the Devils to a 2-1 victory over the Dallas Stars tonight and a two-games-to-one lead in the Stanley Cup finals.</p>
        <p>Arnott and Sykora got the goals and Elias got the postgame compliment.</p>
        <p>''I told Patrik Elias I was very proud of them,'' Coach Larry Robinson said, referring to both Elias and Sykora, who had taken the brunt of the coach's criticism. ''Nobody felt worse than they did.''</p>
        <p>It was the best game so far in the four-of-seven-game championship round, which resumes here on Monday in Reunion Arena. Many Devils felt that the game turned in the first period, when the Stars had a 1-0 lead and a two-man advantage for 49 seconds.</p>
        <p>''They had a chance to take the game away from us,'' Devils goalie Martin Brodeur said. ''And we came through. From there, we really took it to them.''</p>
        <p>But Brodeur gave his team another moment of anxiety with 4 minutes 15 seconds left in the game when he accidentally cleared the puck over the short glass along the side boards. This resulted in a delay-of-game penalty. Although the Stars threatened for almost the entire two minutes, they put only two shots on Brodeur.</p>
        <p>''It's a bad mistake,'' Brodeur said. ''It's something I was upset about. Fortunately, my team came through.''</p>
        <p>In the final minute of the game, after the Stars pulled goalie Ed Belfour for an extra attacker, Brodeur stopped Brett Hull and survived a scary moment when his clearing pass accidentally ended up on the stick of the Stars' Mike Modano.</p>
        <p>Regarding Hull's shot late, Brodeur said: ''Anybody but him! It hit my shoulder and stayed out.''</p>
        <p>In the previous game, a 2-1 Dallas victory on Thursday night in New Jersey, Hull scored both Dallas goals. Tonight's Dallas goal was scored by Sylvain Cote at 13:08 of the first period on the power play. Cote scored after intercepting a clearing pass by Devils defenseman Scott Stevens, who tried to move the puck out of danger after Brodeur made a save on Jere Lehtinen. Brodeur was pulled to the right and Stevens was over him when Cote sent the puck into the open net from the right-wing circle.</p>
        <p>The Devils got the equalizer at 18:06 when Arnott broke clear, took a pass, split the defense, beat Belfour with a low shot and then fell to the ice in celebration. Brian Rafalski and Colin White got the assists.</p>
        <p>''Just kind of chipped it toward Belfour and it went through his five-hole,'' Arnott said, referring to the space between the goalie's leg pads.</p>
        <p>The Devils took a 2-1 lead at 12:27 of the second period on a power-play goal by Sykora, who took a long slap shot from the left side, near the blue line. The puck may have deflected off the stick of Dallas defenseman Derian Hatcher before it glanced off the glove of Belfour and into the net. Arnott and Rafalski got the assists.</p>
        <p>In his criticisms of the line on Friday, Robinson had said that their line turned the puck over too often and that he should have broken up the combination.</p>
        <p>''There was too much to be said about who played bad,'' Arnott said tonight. He said he and his wings, who are both from the Czech Republic, did not talk as much among themselves as they usually do.</p>
        <p>''We were actually pretty quiet,'' Arnott said. ''We were quiet up until the game. Then we started talking a bit.''</p>
        <p>Sykora said: ''We couldn't afford our line to play the same way. We were a little better.'' Instead of trying to beat opposing defensemen with fancy moves at the blue line, Sykora said: ''We wanted to shoot the puck deep and wait for our chances. We did pretty well tonight.''</p>
        <p>Of his winning goal, Sykora said: ''I was just trying to hit the net. I saw Patty screen the goalie. We have to give credit to the guys driving to the net.''</p>
        <p>Arnott finished with seven shots on goal, the most on either team. Elias had four and Sykora two.</p>
        <p>During the two-man disadvantage, with Claude Lemieux in the penalty box for the Devils along with Vladimir Malakhov, much of the penalty killing was done by John Madden and Sergei Nemchinov. Madden, one of four Devils rookies with regular roles, played another outstanding game as a checking center.</p>
        <p>The Devils are now 8-2 on the road in this tournament and are two victories from their first cup championship since 1995. The Stars, defending champions, fell to 9-2 at home in the postseason.</p>
