        <p>REMEMBER the Goldilocks economy? The not too hot, not too cold, low inflation porridge beloved by Alan Greenspan and financial markets?</p>
        <p>Although it's too early to say for sure, the latest numbers seem to indicate that what had been a steaming dish is beginning to cool. But there is little reason, at this point, to suspect it will turn stone cold.</p>
        <p>Last week, purchasing managers said the manufacturing sector expanded in May, but not as fast as previously. And the government said the private sector actually shed some jobs last month, but not too many.</p>
        <p>This sort of stuff is music to investors. The Nasdaq had its best week ever, rising more than 19 percent. The Dow and the S.&amp; P. 500 also moved up briskly.</p>
        <p>Christine Callies, chief United States market strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston, took some time last week to talk about the economy and the stock market as spring begins to molt into summer. Following are excerpts from the conversation:</p>
        <p>Q. The data suggests that the Fed's interest rate increases are beginning to slow the economy. Is that how you read these numbers?</p>
        <p>A. We think economic growth is plateauing, and will gradually slow down over the next several quarters. But there is a lot of natural volatility in reports like retail sales and in housing data, and activity there is not weak. By the end of the summer, we will get more conclusive evidence that the Fed tightening is having an effect.</p>
        <p>Recently, the stock market has assumed a bigger slowdown than is coming, a slowdown that will cause the Fed to ease. But we may be waiting for a while before we know for sure that the Fed has moved to neutral. I don't think we will know the Fed has reached that point until sometime next year.</p>
        <p>Q. So you think the Fed hasn't yet finished tightening?</p>
        <p>A. We see two more tightenings of one-quarter percentage point apiece, the first later this month and another in August. Then we think the Fed will be on hold. The Fed is trying to slow the U.S. economy to what is still a healthy growth rate against the backdrop of the first synchronized global expansion that we have seen in a dozen years.</p>
        <p>The fact that every region of the world is in a reasonably healthy recovery mode will place some demand on the supply of goods and services.</p>
        <p>The Fed is therefore operating in a situation where global growth is reinforcing itself. That will put a floor under global inflation, albeit at a low level.</p>
        <p>We maintain this is potentially good news, because if the Fed is in a gradualist monetary mode that means it might tolerate a little inflation without going overboard.</p>
        <p>Q. What does this mean for stocks?</p>
        <p>A. All in all, this is a fairly benign environment for equity prices. We think the market is in a trading range, and will tread water until price/earnings multiples get down to the point where there is a little bit of headroom. We are almost there.</p>
        <p>Q. How much cheaper does the market have to get? And what sort of a trading range are you talking about?</p>
        <p>A. In order to support a major rally, we need to see multiples down another 10 percent or so. But that doesn't mean prices have to fall. If they stay at these levels, profits will catch up over the next couple of quarters. Trading range corrections are a substitute for faster, steeper corrections, where prices fall by 25 percent or so.</p>
        <p>On the upside, the S.&amp; P. 500 could go as high as 1,540 to 1,550 and the Nasdaq composite could go back to 4,000 or 4,100 and still not change the sideways trend.</p>
        <p>Q. What are the risks to this forecast on the upside, and on the downside?</p>
        <p>A. Bull markets need liquidity in the form of excess money. In order for the market to break out of the trading range on the upside, we would need to see a very substantial increase in liquidity, and we would need to see it over the next month or so.</p>
        <p>On the downside, a major correction in the S.&amp; P. 500 could only occur as a result of a major accident. And the economy, monetary, financial market and foreign exchange risks of this occurring are probably as low as they have been in many years. The one residual weak point in this scenario is that margin debt was not totally neutralized in the April correction. But in all, the environment is remarkably benign.</p>
        <p>Q. It has been widely noted that while valuations in the aggregate are high, big chunks of the stock market are cheap, and have been for some time. Do you agree?</p>
        <p>A. There are pieces of many sectors that look quite good.</p>
        <p>The central concept is to identify companies that deliver growth at a moderate price. That is in contrast to last year, when the trick was to find the fastest-growing companies and buy them, because someone else would come in afterwards and pay more. You can find a lot of the companies I am talking about now in the capital goods area.</p>
        <p>A lot of electrical equipment companies are developing new-economy growth rates and are trading at old-economy prices.</p>
        <p>Three names we like are SCI Systems, Sanmina and General Electric, which is not overpriced relative to the top-line growth it is generating.</p>
