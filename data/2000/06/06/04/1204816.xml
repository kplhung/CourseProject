      <abstract>
        <p>Political philosophy of 'mutual assured destruction,' or MAD, that kept the peace during cold war no longer seems sufficient when contemplating rogue countries and leaders who might not be deterred from using nuclear weapons by threat of overwhelming response; weakening of MAD deterrent has given new impetus to calls for National Missile Defense, which US has promised to share with 'civilized' nations; but that promise has raised new question about which countries can be deemed 'civilized' and which are 'irresponsible'; photo (M)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>FOR nearly half a century the cold war world's tense stability was built on a simple bit of political philosophy. Nicknamed, appropriately, MAD, for Mutual Assured Destruction, it held that the leader of a country advanced enough to build nuclear weapons would never actually use them if he was assured his nation would also be obliterated by his enemy.</p>
        <p>Why call this a political philosophy? Because at its core, as at the core of every political philosophy from Plato to Marx, is an appraisal of human nature. MAD's view of human nature was, paradoxically, surprisingly sunny. It held that a leader, no matter how ambitious, ideological or even nutty, would never be so far gone (or allowed to be so far gone by his cohorts) as to risk the annihilation of his own people.</p>

        <p>FOR nearly half a century the cold war world's tense stability was built on a simple bit of political philosophy. Nicknamed, appropriately, MAD, for Mutual Assured Destruction, it held that the leader of a country advanced enough to build nuclear weapons would never actually use them if he was assured his nation would also be obliterated by his enemy.</p>
        <p>Why call this a political philosophy? Because at its core, as at the core of every political philosophy from Plato to Marx, is an appraisal of human nature. MAD's view of human nature was, paradoxically, surprisingly sunny. It held that a leader, no matter how ambitious, ideological or even nutty, would never be so far gone (or allowed to be so far gone by his cohorts) as to risk the annihilation of his own people.</p>
        <p>That was the heart of deterrence: America's belief that the Russians were rational and their belief that Americans were, too.</p>
        <p>As nuclear technology proliferates, however, the nuclear equation is becoming more complicated, and a new view of deterrence is taking hold in the United States. That view was summed up by a bipartisan report last fall from a federal advisory commission studying national security in the 21st century: Threats to American security will be more diffuse, harder to anticipate and more difficult to neutralize than ever before. Deterrence will not work as it once did; in many cases it may not work at all.''</p>
        <p>Why? Because in the post cold war world, the new thinking goes, there are some countries and leaders who simply cannot be trusted to be rational about nuclear weapons.</p>
        <p>The old line in the sand was between two ideologies, each held by people the other believed to be capable of acting sensibly. The new line is between people who can be counted on to behave like us and people who can't. Under the old thinking the best defense was the threat of an overwhelming offense. But in the new world, the new theorists suggest, the best defense in some cases is actually a defense.</p>
        <p>George W. Bush embraced this view in a speech recently calling for a robust missile defense of the United States. And President Clinton is in Moscow this weekend to discuss the new thinking, and his own less expansive missile defense plans, with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who holds a treaty barring the United States (or Russia) from deploying a National Missile Defense (N.M.D.).</p>
        <p>On his way to Moscow, President Clinton gave a glimpse of the new strategic view. The world, Mr. Clinton suggested during a stop in Lisbon, can be divided between ''civilized nations,'' and ''irresponsible new nuclear powers and their possible alliances with terrorists and other groups.'' Rest assured, Mr. Clinton said, America would share with the civilized the technology to defend against the irresponsible.</p>
        <p>Who belongs in this second group? Mr. Clinton named neither the civilized nations nor the irresponsible ones, although there was a hint he was prepared to include Russia in the civilized category because the very phrase was one Boris Yeltsin had once used to describe a world protected by missile defenses.</p>
        <p>But what of China, which is on the verge of modernizing and expanding its nuclear force and openly views a system defending the continental United States as a threat to that force?</p>
        <p>The Americans say it's not China they're worried about, either, but what the Clinton administration calls ''rogue states.'' North Korea, for example, would fall into this category. But why is Kim Jong Il of North Korea not likely to be deterred by the threat of national devastation, if he struck at America?</p>
        <p>To be sure, North Korea is an isolated place, the last Stalinist state and so economically troubled that people flee to China for a better life. When Mr. Kim went on a secret state visit to Beijing last week pictures released afterward showed him wearing a Mao jacket, while China's president, Jiang Zemin, was attired in suit and tie. Certainly he is behind the fashion curve. But does that mean he would risk extinction?</p>
        <p>Since the end of the cold war there has been only one real-world test of deterrence against a so-called rogue state, and it supports those who say it remains effective. It came on the eve of the Gulf War. In a variety of ways, including a direct meeting with Tariq Aziz, the Iraqi Foreign Minister, the American secretary of state, James A. Baker, warned Saddam Hussein that the use of chemical or biological weapons against allied forces would be met by ''the most severe consequences.''</p>
        <p>THE Iraqis did not use these weapons and later said they understood the American warning to mean a nuclear response.</p>
        <p>''Saddam Hussein may have been ruthlessly expansionist, but he did not act irrationally,'' writes Robert S. Litwak, a former member of the national security council staff at the White House, in his book, '' Rogue States and U.S. Foreign Policy'' (Woodrow Wilson Center Press, 2000).</p>
        <p>Critics of America's emerging new strategic thinking, which is to say most of the rest of the world, seem to think that the new theories of deterrence have more to do with the mind of America than the mind of Saddam Hussein or of Kim Jong Il.</p>
        <p>Americans have always seen themselves as self- reliant, and they have placed great faith in technology. Replacing MAD with N.M.D. relieves you of a dependence on the rationality of your fellow man, in favor of an independence granted by your homegrown radar, computers and missiles. America's allies are not convinced that is an improvement, but Americans seem to be.</p>
        <p>While acknowledging that they do not know much about it, nearly 60 percent of Americans said in a survey last month that they favor trying to build a missile defense system against nuclear attack. Told that $60 billion had already been spent, opinion remained in favor. One American in four wants to try to build the system despite the cost, even if scientists conclude it probably won't work, according to the survey, conducted by The New York Times and CBS News.</p>
        <p>What most Americans have not begun to consider is that an anti-missile system would represent a fundamental shift in how the nation thinks about nuclear war.</p>
        <p>In 1945, the first year of the nuclear age, Albert Einstein described atomic energy as a ''menace'' and added: ''Perhaps it is well that it should be. It may intimidate the human race into bringing order into its international affairs, which, without the pressure of fear, it would not do.''</p>
        <p>For a half century that is what happened, more or less. What frightens some analysts is that a shield against nuclear attack on the United States would make Americans believe they are safe and thus help lift from their leaders the pressure of fear, which helps motivate the world's one superpower to work for continued order and safety in the world.</p>
