        <p>NEW ADDRESSES</p>
        <p>Poems.</p>
        <p>By Kenneth Koch.</p>
        <p>73 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Alfred A. Knopf. $23.</p>
        <p>Kenneth Kochs latest book, ''New Addresses, consists of 50 poems, each one an ode to a different subject, such as kidding around: ''Kidding around you are terrible sometimes / When I feel that I have to do it / Suddenly behaving like an ape, piling up snow on top of a friend / When I know that isnt going to win her heart. In ''To World War Two, this aesthete-Army veteran admits, ''It felt unusual / Even if for a good cause / To be part of a destructive force. And in ''To Psychoanalysis, Kochs voice lowers to a soothing murmur of therapeutic nostalgia: ''I took the Lexington Avenue subway / To arrive at you in your glory days / Of the Nineteen Fifties when we believed / That you could solve any problem.</p>
        <p>If the collections gimmick is to personify, and speak forthrightly to, things, events and states of being (orgasms, for example: ''Youve never really settled down / Have you, orgasms?), its best poems transcend gimmickry through that mixture of earnestness, ebullience and dreamy romanticism that long ago rendered Koch the ageless grad student of the New York School of Poets. Koch once wrote of Frank OHara that ''what is really there, in the poets thoughts, fantasies and feelings, is what is richest in possibility and worth the most attention, but he might as well have been describing his own essence. For close to 50 years, Koch has created a body of work whose characteristic quality is a sense of playfulness that becomes poignant at the turn of a line. Kochs industrious inventiveness -- he is the author of 16 books of poetry and numerous nonfiction works, primarily about the teaching of poetry -- has not flagged.</p>
        <p>Youd think Koch had reached that point in his life when hed tackled all the major subjects of interest to him, a notion seemingly ratified here by his use of the ode, which in its classical form memorializes people, places and things familiar and dear to the writer. Nonetheless, two poems in ''New Addresses take on a subject new to Kochs work: his Jewishness, ''the tray . . . on which my childhood was served. In addition to the enjoyably cornball ''To Jewishness, Paris, Ambition, Trees, My Heart, and Destiny, there is the blunt ''To Jewishness, in which his ethnic origin turns the tables on the poet to address him:</p>
        <p>''Why not admit that I</p>
        <p>Gave you the life</p>
        <p>Of the mind as a thing</p>
        <p>To aspire to? And</p>
        <p>Where did you go</p>
        <p>To find your 'freedom? to</p>
        <p>New York, which was</p>
        <p>Full of me.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, Koch lets himself off the religious hook by taking refuge in jokes and sex:</p>
        <p>I found</p>
        <p>I preferred</p>
        <p>Kissing girls who didnt</p>
        <p>Have you. Blonde</p>
        <p>Hair, blue eyes,</p>
        <p>And Christianity (oddly enough) had an</p>
        <p>Aphrodisiac effect on me.</p>
        <p>Oddly enough, my foot -- this is nothing more or less than a metrical variation on the siren call of the shiksa, a modern theme at least as old as 60s-era Philip Roth.</p>
        <p>There is a level on which ''New Addresses is not an entirely successful endeavor. Read in one sitting, these enthusiastic apostrophes can be wearyingly whimsical, the sort of homework assignment Professor Koch might give students in one of his teaching-children-to-write-poetry workshops. The constant repetition of the second person singular begins to sound like a slam poet doing a bad Pauline Kael imitation. But the best of the poems,</p>
        <p>when each is taken on its own terms, bolster the bold belief that underpins much of Kochs career -- namely, that to be a continually gracious and grateful writer is not to be a precious or deluded one.</p>
        <p>In the deceptively jaunty ''To My Fathers Business, Koch recalls himself as a young man in Cincinnati who will resist his fathers hopes that his son will take over the family furniture</p>
        <p>store, since ''Kenny knew even then that his true destiny was to ''go on to explore / Deep and/or nonsensical themes -- the stuff of poetry, informed by a sensibility that leaves his father ''proud but ''unsure about / Some aspects of his little laddie.</p>
        <p>Leo Koch need not have fretted. His son ended up that rare contemporary figure: an unironic, unsentimental optimist, one who can write a poem called ''To 'Yes, an ode to the affirmative aspect of life -- Yes to the finality of the brightness / And to the enduring qualities of the lark -- and not seem like a silly laddie for a second.</p>
