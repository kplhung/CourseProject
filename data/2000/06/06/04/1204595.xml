        <p>PERHAPS no neighborhood in Greenwich will be as affected by the State Appellate Court ruling on the Greenwich beach than that of Mary Staples-Webber. She has lived in the Lucas Point neighborhood, just outside the entrance to the beach, for 32 years, long enough for her to liken her neighborhood to ''a comfortable old shoe.''</p>
        <p>''It's an unpretentious little village,'' she said. ''All you need in the summer is a pair of blue jeans and a bathing suit. It's the whole ambience, the whole quietness. Old Greenwich is a marvelous old village, and there's not many of them left.''</p>

        <p>PERHAPS no neighborhood in Greenwich will be as affected by the State Appellate Court ruling on the Greenwich beach than that of Mary Staples-Webber. She has lived in the Lucas Point neighborhood, just outside the entrance to the beach, for 32 years, long enough for her to liken her neighborhood to ''a comfortable old shoe.''</p>
        <p>''It's an unpretentious little village,'' she said. ''All you need in the summer is a pair of blue jeans and a bathing suit. It's the whole ambience, the whole quietness. Old Greenwich is a marvelous old village, and there's not many of them left.''</p>
        <p>The residents of Lucas Point fear that the nature of their neighborhood, with its multimillion-dollar homes and views of Long Island Sound, will change if the Connecticut Supreme Court upholds a state appeals court ruling and opens up the 147-acre Greenwich Point to the general public. They said they feel the resulting increase in traffic will clog their streets and make the simplest tasks, like going to the bank, grocery store or just backing out of the driveway, almost impossible.</p>
        <p>''You have to understand we're living on an extremely narrow neck of land that leads to an island, which is Greenwich Point,'' said Bob Churchill, president of the Lucas Point Association, which is made up of 69 homeowners. ''There is no way to change the physical fact that this strip can't handle a significant increase in traffic.''</p>
        <p>The road that connects Lucas Point to the park is called Tod's Driftway, a quarter-mile stretch that is the only way into Greenwich Point. The association owns the road and long ago granted the town an easement so residents could get to the beach.</p>
        <p>''If you look at state parks like Hammonasset, or Sherwood Island, they have four-lane highways,'' said Mark R. Kravitz, a lawyer for the association. ''It's unthinkable to lay that kind of traffic down on top of Tod's Driftway, which is as narrow as 16 feet in some places.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Staples-Webber said the biggest concern among her Lucas Point neighbors was ''the additional traffic.''</p>
        <p>''We have a road that isn't even up to standard now,'' she said. ''How will the town handle the traffic if it continues this way, and the safety factor? What if your house is on fire? What if someone has a heart attack?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Churchill said he once saw a fire truck unable to pass a knot of traffic on adjoining Shore Road during a backup on Tod's Driftway.</p>
        <p>''It's not a constant condition, but it does occur on the best summer days,'' said Mr. Churchill, an 11-year resident of Lucas Point. ''Our expert at trial testified that if it became law, initially there would be an increase in use, but that it would significantly increase as time went by.''</p>
        <p>The Lucas Point Association, along with another neighborhood group, the Greenwich Point Preservation Association, also argues that a wide-open beach would force them to contend with the exhaust fumes and increased traffic noise.</p>
        <p>Opponents of wider access, including the town itself, argue that use of the park is already at maximum capacity on holidays and warmer weekends, and to permit general access would encourage dangerously high levels of traffic. Access should be limited to those whose taxes pay for Greenwich Point's upkeep, they said.</p>
        <p>A brief filed in Appellate Court by Mr. Kravitz projects a fivefold increase in traffic around Greenwich Point if the beach is opened to the general public. Old Greenwich residents said any further road congestion would be too much.</p>
        <p>''I'm very concerned about traffic in the Lucas Point area, because of the narrow width of the road,'' said Coline Jenkins-Sahlin, head of the Old Greenwich district at the town's municipal governing body, the Representative Town Meeting. ''If you have two passing cars, pedestrians and bikes, you will have an accident.''</p>
        <p>Katherine Kern, who lives on Shore Road near the park, said she expects that the town can take some action to limit traffic, such as posting signs that indicate when the beach is full.</p>
        <p>''If we lose the case, I don't think it's going to affect the neighborhood that dramatically,'' she said. ''There are certain ways to keep the amount of traffic down, but it will cost more money. I can see property taxes going up.''</p>
        <p>She added that the people who would be most likely to suffer under such a scenario would be Greenwich residents who don't live near the park. ''We can still walk to the beach over here, traffic or not.''</p>
        <p>The easement that the association granted the town on Tod's Driftway, which specifically excludes access to nonresidents of the town, could figure heavily in deliberations about the case. Could the Lucas Point Association remove its easement and close the park to everyone? The brief hints at such an approach, saying opening Greenwich Point up to the general public ''would alter the essential nature of the easement in an entirely unanticipated way, so as to render it void.''</p>
        <p>''My own personal feeling is I don't think they'd do that to Greenwich residents,'' Carol Ducret, who lives on Tod's Driftway, said of the Lucas Point Association, which she belongs to.</p>
        <p>Ms. Staples-Webber, also an association member, was not ruling anything out. ''It's a situation that has to be explored,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kravitz, the lawyer for the association, said, ''I think it's an interesting question, but academic. We expect to win.''</p>
        <p>The question of whether Greenwich can restrict nonresidents from using Greenwich Point and how traffic might be affected is not new. It was floated back when the town first considered buying the onetime estate of J. Kennedy Tod in 1940. At that time, the newspaper, Greenwich Time, called it ''a question which figures importantly in the discussion throughout town.'' Despite strong resistance, much of it over the purchase price, the town ended up buying Tod's Point, as it was then called, in January 1945 for $550,000.</p>
        <p>Mr. Churchill would not say how much the Lucas Point Association has spent to maintain the ban, except to call it ''a meaningful number.''</p>
        <p>''We feel the stakes are high, and that we are right in so many issues,'' he said. ''We have a duty to stay the course, not just for the neighborhood but for the entire state. It's bad social medicine.''</p>
