        <p>SWIMMING SWEET ARROW</p>
        <p>By Maureen Gibbon.</p>
        <p>205 pp. Boston:</p>
        <p>Little, Brown &amp; Company. $21.95.</p>
        <p>The Sweet Arrow of Maureen Gibbons first novel is a lake, but dont wait for the swimming scene. InSwimming Sweet Arrow, both the sweet arrow (an arrow that flies straight and true) and the swimming remain metaphorical: figures for the narrators dreamy optimism about her life and her growing awareness of the powerful currents in which she moves. Evangeline Starr Raybuck is a self-described country girl, both knowing and nave, concerned with how people bind themselves together and what happens when the binds dont hold.</p>
        <p>At 18, Vangie lives alone in a run-down apartment in rural Pennsylvania; her mother has gone, with little ceremony. I knew how not to get pregnant, I knew how to earn a wage, Vangie says. All my mom could do was give me a black nightie and wish me well. Vangies father is drunk most of the time, stopping by to do what he thought a dad did: buy groceries and be ready to raise hell. In the absence of her own family, Vangie creates a new one, having sex with her boyfriend, Del, in the same car at the same time as their best friends, June and Ray. The four of us were inside our own web, she explains. But as Vangie and June expand their makeshift family a bringing in their lovers brothers and turning tentatively to each other a it too falls apart</p>
        <p>Sex is the novels main concern; so much so that sexual terms, most of them unquotable here, become a kind of refrain. Sex is what Vangie talks about with June and Del, trading information adults have withheld. Part of her project as a narrator is to withhold nothing, to tell what they never tell you about being a girl, and shes as unflinching when the sex is scary and abusive as she is when its just what she wants.</p>
        <p>Unembarrassed as they are about the language of sex, most of Gibbons characters are shy about their emotional history. When they encounter pain a caused by incest, alcoholism or abandonment a they count it a mark of friendship to back away and let secrets be kept. But Vangie is compelled to make sense of the things the others cant talk about. She has sex with Frank because hes Dels brother, more dangerous than a stranger; with Kevin because hes Junes brother and I knew hed help me start any fire I wanted to start.</p>
        <p>June also seeks out a family romance with two brothers who arent hers, and Del fights his own emerging violence with drugs and religion. Things fall apart, but the novels men, even at their worst, arent villains, and the women arent victims; all are accountable for what they do. As Vangie shrewdly observes, none of us did anything for long unless we wanted to.</p>
        <p>In the year the novel spans, as Vangie finishes high school and begins to support herself, the jobs she takes become central to her emerging sense of what she can do, who she can become. Its all hard, dirty work, efficiently described without irony or self-pity. At a local farm, she learns to punch troublesome chickens in the head to avoid chasing them through the coop, but she can still honestly say that chicken-packing jobs were fashionable and thatgoing to work was almost like going to a party.</p>
        <p>After graduation, Vangie becomes a waitress and hardens herself to a different sort of roughness, until the extreme version of that roughness drives her out. She turns next to picking pears a work so exhausting that stopping to rest, drinking warm water from a shared cup, leaning back against my sack. . . . I didnt think of anything that hurt.</p>
        <p>While the plot of Swimming Sweet Arrow is sometimes more surprising to Vangie than it is to us, the accomplishment of the novel is in its voice a an affecting blend of innocence and experience, an attempt to give words to what seems inarticulate about love. In Vangies telling, this coming-of-age story is both satisfying and unexpected, an account of swimming in deep water and navigating its currents alone.</p>
