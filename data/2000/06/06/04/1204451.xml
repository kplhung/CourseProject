        <p>MILLIONS OF MONARCHS, BUNCHES OF BEETLES</p>
        <p>How Bugs Find Strength in Numbers.</p>
        <p>By Gilbert Waldbauer.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 264 pp. Cambridge, Mass.:</p>
        <p>Harvard University Press. $24.95.</p>
        <p>We tend to think of species as being either social or solitary. Ants, hyenas and chimpanzees are social; butterflies, leopards and orangutans are solitary. We seldom wonder how social species got that way, or whether a species can be an in-between, sometimes social, sometimes not. It also seems natural to think of species as being ranked in a Great Chain of Being: apes above dogs; dogs above frogs; and apes, dogs and frogs -- all vertebrates -- above humble invertebrates like beetles, spiders and flies.</p>
        <p>Such simplistic beliefs won't survive a reading of ''Millions of Monarchs, Bunches of Beetles: How Bugs Find Strength in Numbers.'' Its author, Gilbert Waldbauer, professor emeritus of entomology at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, has devoted a lifetime to some of the less celebrated varieties of insects in the United States and across the globe. He distills his knowledge in a charming and unassuming work packed with fascinating detail, showing us, among many other things, that our instinctive beliefs about six-legged creatures are at best patronizing and often dead wrong.</p>
        <p>Take patterns of behavior. One would think that mammalian or avian brains, hundreds of times bigger than bug brains, would be able to think up smarter strategies for defense against predators or securing prey. Not so. When it comes to hunting, many insects are ''miniature counterparts of predaceous vertebrates.'' Wolf spiders range open country by night, like leopards. Praying mantises lurk by blossoms, crouched motionless, to ambush nectar-seeking insects, just as blue herons stand by a lake or stream waiting for fish. Members of the spider species Mallos gregaris gather to overpower larger insects caught in their communal web, just as hyenas band together to bring down a wildebeest or orcas cluster to tear a whale apart.</p>
        <p>Defensive strategies too take no account of the vertebrate-invertebrate distinction. Canadian musk oxen, when attacked by wolves, form a defensive circle, with their weapons, sharp down-curved horns, on the outside. Leaf beetle larvae, when threatened by stink bugs, do exactly the same; the only difference is that they face inward and can keep on eating while their armored rears protect them. But potato beetle larvae form their circles the same way musk oxen do, waving their forelegs to defend themselves.</p>
        <p>You might think that a conspicuous mass would be counterfunctional, drawing predators that might otherwise have missed isolated individuals. But put yourself in the insect's shoes, as Waldbauer does, and you'll see that advantages often outweigh risks. Take insects that produce toxins, like the ladybird; any bird that inadvertently eats one is nauseated. Since ladybirds have a distinctive pattern of bright-colored spots, birds quickly recognize them and avoid repeating the experience. But aversions aren't innate; they have to be learned. A ladybird alone might be the one the bird learns on, but the same ladybird in a dense cluster vastly multiplies its chances of having another ladybird eaten in its stead. Moreover, the more ladybirds a group contains, the more salient the message of their coloring -- experienced birds probably won't even try attacking them.</p>
        <p>So insects find safety in numbers, but the benefits of gregariousness don't stop at self-defense. They can create their own microclimates, using their massed bodies to raise or lower temperature and conserve moisture. Some (including bees and termites) have developed elaborate yet quite different ways of air-conditioning their nests. Numbers help even in the mating game. Some insects, like fireflies, attract mates by visual signals; a lone male firefly in the jungle may be hidden from potential spouses by dense foliage, but a tree filled with thousands of fireflies can be seen (and will attract females) from miles around. For bees, a flowering shrub may serve as a ''singles bar,'' where gangs of male bees hang out awaiting any female who drops by for a shot of nectar.</p>
        <p>Insects use mass tactics to make war as well as love. Bizarre indeed are the silent but deadly conflicts that take place between trees and bark beetles. The beetles' boring damages the tree's growth layer and the tubes that carry nutrients to its roots. The tree responds by flooding the beetles' tunnels with resin to trap or drown them. The beetles fight back by inoculating the tree with fungus spores, which they carry in specially adapted hollows in their bodies, and by releasing pheromones -- some actually synthesized from the tree's own toxic defenses -- which recruit more beetles to join in the attack. A healthy tree will win the battle unless many beetles join to subdue it.</p>
        <p>As the foregoing suggests, this is a book packed with surprising information. Did you know that a type of bloodsucking louse lives its entire life in one nostril of a seal? Or that one species of aquatic midge may have a lifespan of no more than a half-hour? Or that a locust was tried for its crimes, found guilty and executed as recently as 1866? Locusts and other types of grasshopper have impinged on our species more onerously than any other insect, barring only plague-bearing lice, and Waldbauer gives us vivid accounts of the devastation they have caused here and in the Middle East, as well as their strange legal history (in the Middle Ages they had defense counsel as well as prosecutors, and ecclesiastical courts, seeing their depredations as divine punishment for sinners, often acquitted them).</p>
        <p>All this and much more -- the life cycles of monarch butterflies and mayflies; the dangers of monoculture; the ''five-way ecological relationship between telephone companies, eastern tent caterpillars, robins, wild black cherry saplings and cuckoos''; recipes for roast cicada -- is presented by Waldbauer in a winning style. He has a way of embedding unavoidable technicalities in the middle of lively anecdotes, so that the reader learns almost without noticing. But he does not shirk theoretical issues. His opening explanations of kin selection, group selection and inclusive fitness are among the most succinct and user-friendly I have read, and although he never forces the issue, antievolutionists should be compelled to read his section on corn rootworms.</p>
        <p>With their shorter life spans, insects evolve faster than other creatures. Within living memory, Western and Northern corn rootworms, two serious agricultural pests, have each evolved in novel ways. Since they die in the fall, leaving their eggs to overwinter, farmers had hoped to eradicate them by rotating crops; if they planted soybeans in alternate years, the hungry larvae would find no corn roots to eat and would starve. Northern corn rootworms responded by lengthening the period during which their eggs lie dormant, thus waiting out the soybean year and springing to life only when corn returned. Western corn rootworms simply switched to laying their eggs in soybean fields. In other words, a shift in selective pressure can take a rare trait that would have been neutral (lengthened dormancy) or seriously dysfunctional (indiscriminate egg-laying) under the old conditions, and quickly spread it through a whole species.</p>
        <p>But perhaps the most striking feature of Waldbauer's delightful book is the enthusiasm with which it is written. A lifetime's involvement with what for many of us are mere pesky little critters has not dulled his pleasure in chronicling their variety or his amazement at their strangeness. He revels in the natural world; his response to it shows in the vivid vignettes of personal experience that introduce many of his chapters, whose flavor cannot be appreciated without quotation: ''On a sunny January day I walked in a woodland along the Sangamon river in Illinois. . . . The thin blanket of snow squeaked beneath my boots. . . . A large dead tree stood by the side of the trail, big pieces of loose bark still clinging to its trunk. I pulled off a small slab to see what might be hiding under it.''</p>
        <p>You too will share his infectious curiosity. Indeed, you'll probably never think of insects in quite the same way again.</p>
