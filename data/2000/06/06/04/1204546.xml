        <p>FROM the outside, the ranch house in Bay Shore, with its white aluminum siding and pale green shutters, looks more like a cottage than a decorator show house. Though there are 20 rooms inside, including six bathrooms, all but the living room are boxy, not grand. The house has neither soaring ceilings nor palladium windows, and the downstairs rooms have nine-foot ceilings. Upstairs, the ceilings are eight feet.</p>
        <p>In most respects, it's just a traditional 1940's dwelling, rather large but not fancy. But for the first designers' show house of its kind on the South Shore, its ordinariness was the point.</p>
        <p>''There are show houses and there are show houses,'' said Sandra Lessing, a decorator from Bay Shore. She turned a tight space under the eaves into a little girl's getaway, replete with tea party sets and a miniature washstand. ''This is for regular people to see what they can do in their homes,'' she said. ''My own house is this era. There are smaller and there are larger, but when you look in Islip and Brightwaters and Bay Shore, you see a lot of the same features.''</p>
        <p>The Showhouse-by-the-Bay, which will be open through June 30, is far from a mansion. And the professional interior designers who redecorated the house, the parsonage on the grounds of St. Peter's Episcopal Church, dubbed it a modest man's castle, a house the average family could live in. The event is a fund-raiser for Southside Hospital Auxiliaries, Town of Islip Breast Cancer Coalition and St. Peter's.</p>
        <p>Lynn Gerhard, a designer based in Islip, has participated in show houses on the Island for 20 years, all of them in palatial North Shore homes. But she preferred the creative challenge that came with working in tight quarters. ''The grand rooms are beautiful to look it, but they are not as easily translatable to normal living on Long Island,'' Ms. Gerhard said. ''You don't need a large space.''</p>
        <p>For this show, she created a home office in a sliver of a room on the first floor, installing a white wooden wall unit against muted sage walls, adding bird-shaped pewter knobs and drawer pulls that resemble roses.</p>
        <p>The round table in the dining room seats only six. But Richard Schlesinger, a designer in Dix Hills, had the walls painted gold, the ceiling a deep eggplant. With little room for a buffet, he hid the plates and cups in revolving fluted rectangular columns that double as cupboards. ''It's more compact, but it's more believable,''  Mr. Schlesinger said of the 16-by-16 room. ''It's a great idea. Instead of showing 15-foot ceilings and walls of stone and marble, this is easy to relate to. All these things people can do themselves.''</p>
        <p>If they can afford to. The dining room, Mr. Schlesinger said, cost about $35,000 to decorate, including the $8,000 French bronze chandelier, gold Tibetan wool rug and silk window treatments that puddle onto the floor. And the total did not include the paintings on the walls.</p>
        <p>In the master bath, the lipstick tray sits on the back of the commode, the vanity is laminated, not granite, and a seashell facade surrounds the fiberglass bathtub enclosure. ''I took a standard bathroom and glamorized it,'' said an Islip designer, John De Santis, showing how tacking up one end of a sheer curtain panel gives it a more stylish, draped effect.</p>
        <p>Mr. De Santis also turned the master bedroom into a multifunctional haven, including a custom-made bedside table that doubles as a nightstand and computer desk. To create a soothing atmosphere, he had a $4,000 waterfall cascade down a slab of granite by the door.</p>
        <p>Though the 35-foot-square living room could be used as a ballroom, Dorothy and Marcie Gorsline, a mother and daughter design and decorative-painting team from Bay Shore, tried to make the addition a cozy, more livable space, with family books and pictures, including a portrait of Mrs. Gorsline's mother, Sally Paxson, who recently died. ''It's not as sterile as mansions can be,'' said Marcie Gorsline. ''A lot of houses are museumlike. We want you to relax and sit down and have a cup of tea.''</p>
        <p>Upstairs, Linda Diers, an interior designer from Centerport, created a pale yellow nursery, using a pine armoire, antique brass crib, rattan chair and old wicker carriage. The ceiling was painted with a cloudy blue sky. But the room was so small that she decided to put the chest of drawers in the closet, laying a cushion for a changing table on top. ''It's about the size of a baby's room in a normal house,'' said Ms. Diers, having previously decorated a far more spacious bedroom at a decorator show house at Oheka Castle in Huntington. ''It's so human. It's so livable. People can imagine it.''</p>
        <p>After seeing Ms. Diers's work, Lorraine Ringer-Prezioso, a volunteer, was inspired. ''I'm painting my daughter's floor,'' Ms. Ringer-Prezioso said. ''The concepts in this room are concepts you can use.''</p>
        <p>In the antique-filled grandmother's boudoir down the hall, Carol Wolf, an interior designer based in Babylon, nailed extra moldings onto the ceiling. ''It gives the illusion of a tray ceiling,'' Ms. Wolf said. ''It makes the wall seem higher. It gives an elegance that isn't really there.'' Raising the cornices on the window treatments and placing a half canopy above the single Louis XVI bed also added height to the bedroom.</p>
        <p>In the greenhouse, Suzanne Arink, a designer from Port Jefferson, tried to be as frugal as possible in using the space as a seasonal dining area.</p>
        <p>''The goal as not to see how much we could spend but how little we could do it for,'' she said, pointing out the burlap drapes and unmatched wooden chairs. ''The people in the area are low-key, not high French provincial. The North Shore has a much grander architectural style.  This is more of a typical Long Island farmhouse. It's a more relaxed style. People here are less formal.''</p>
        <p>But the illusion of a working man's dwelling ended there. Set on eight acres, with a swimming pool and tennis court, the property also includes a two-story stucco and brick cottage designed for the decorators' event by Massimiliano Gargiulo, a master cabinet maker from Islip. His fairy tale playhouse has a pink loft bedroom and whimsical flower-shaped windows. Its price: $15,000.</p>
        <p>Cooking Masters</p>
        <p>The evening was billed ''In Good Taste: A Sampling of Fine Food and Wine.'' It was the first in a series of events at the recent annual New York Institute of Technology Gold Coast Food and Wine Classic at the De Seversky Culinary Arts Center in Old Westbury. Sliced filet mignon with mushrooms in a garlic and butter sauce from Bryant &amp; Cooper, a steakhouse in Roslyn; barrel-fermented 1998 Chardonnay from Paumanok Vineyards in Aquebogue, and flourless chocolate cake with strawberries and a drizzle of chocolate sauce from the Palm Court restaurant at the Carltun in Eisenhower Park were among the choices for the $50 fee. Then there were the tastings from less well-known local cooks: baby rack of lamb with a dry-fig sauce, blue tortilla rounds with grilled shrimp and Key lime tart, all made by the 45 graduating culinary arts students in Robert Rizzuto's international cooking class. Could anybody tell the difference?</p>
        <p>''A lot of people asked us if we had business cards,'' said Juanita Andrade, 24, an aspiring chef from Queens, who doled out miniature vegetable puff pastries and a kidney bean Kiev, a vegetarian version of chicken a la Kiev. ''Another asked where the restaurant was located,'' she said. ''It was very flattering.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Andrade's last class is Tuesday. She started her culinary career at age 10, washing dishes while her sister baked pies. ''I had to work my way to the pies,'' she said. Now she is hoping to find a job as a prep cook at a country club. ''I do real good with chicken dishes,'' Ms. Andrade said, though she's still willing to just do the dishes.</p>
        <p>After crusting the lamb, rolling sushi and boiling couscous, Frank Falgiano, 20, an aspiring chef from Seaford, spent the evening pouring Kahlua into wineglasses rimmed with sugar, then caramelizing them over a flame, trying to keep up with a growing line of customers for sparkling Irish coffee.</p>
        <p>''My goal is to open up my own restaurant,'' Mr. Falgiano said after serving his 245th cup. ''I love cooking. I love to be on the line, producing, running, sweating and setting up creative plates.'' Had working the evening side by side with the Island's top chefs taught him any great culinary secrets? ''The most important thing is not to panic,'' Mr. Falgiano said. ''You have to stay calm.''</p>
