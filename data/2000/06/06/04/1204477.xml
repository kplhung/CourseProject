        <p>BOSTON food folk are bent on shaking off the lingering stigma of ''cold roast Boston'' and baked beans. And the crusade has spread to the suburbs. Over the last few years new-style bistros as distinctive as the towns they serve have been laying to rest those canards. All are run by owners determined to produce food that would do New York or West Coast restaurants proud without compromising the neighborliness and informality of the ''local.'' They've succeeded so well that these three bistros are now destinations in their own right. And then, of course, there is my favorite clam shack.</p>
        <p>Blue Ginger</p>
        <p>Ming Tsai voluntarily acknowledges that two and a half years ago he and his wife,  Polly, chose a former grocer's in Wellesley for their ''East-West bistro'' on the basis of demographics. They convinced themselves that residents of that rather buttoned-down college town and of the prosperous neighboring area were sophisticated enough to appreciate his take on fusion cooking. The strategy today required to snare a weekend reservation for one of Blue Ginger's 120 places demonstrates the method in their madness.</p>
        <p>Sophisticated it is, reflecting Ming Tsai's own background. Born of Chinese parents, the 36-year-old chef was raised in Dayton, Ohio, where he pitched in at his mother's restaurant between semesters at Andover and Yale. That East Coast education conferred the confidence to do his own thing: cook. Training at the Cordon Bleu in Paris and doing time as a ''pastry peon'' at Fauchon, Paris's pluperfect caterer, he began to unfurl his own colors. At a trendy bistro, he introduced Parisians to sole with fermented black beans, garlic and ginger before returning to graduate school at Cornell. He honed his skills under Ken Hom's tutelage at Silks in San Francisco and then ran restaurants in Palo Alto and Santa Fe. He also discovered that he was not made to be an employee. And so to Wellesley. Less than eight months after Blue Ginger opened, ''East Meets West With Ming Tsai,'' his first television series, aired on the Food Network. His articulate charm disarmed audiences and won an impassioned following -- and a daytime Emmy. His Wellesley customers soon found themselves sharing banquettes with foodies from as far away as North Korea.</p>
        <p>With another couple, my husband, Ken, and I snagged a late table on a recent Monday evening. Each dish on Mr. Tsai's menu broadcasts his multicultural heritage.  The foie gras-shiitake shumai with Sauternes-shallot broth are rich, woodsy mushroom-liver dumplings the consistency of  French quenelles, but clad in won-ton wrappers that diners float in a sassy-sweet clear elixir. Tangy cucumber kimchee and Korean chile aioli brought out the sweetness of scallops in crispy sesame overcoats.</p>
        <p>Our first rush of hunger assuaged, we could appreciate the soothing room. Designed by the Tsais with help from Debbie Durland, an architect, the space is broken up by wood-framed screens and a graceful moon gate with splashing fountain. An open kitchen brightens one side. The animation of diners as polyglot as the ingredients lends excitement to the otherwise vanilla setting.</p>
        <p>Sea bass marinated in sake and miso, one of Ming Tsai's signature dishes, proved intriguing. The tart saltiness of the miso enriched the subtle meatiness of the fish, a contrast emphasized by wasabi oil and soy syrup. Morsels of soba noodle sushi provided textural counterpoint. All tasters chorused regret that the fish hadn't made it to the table hot. We did better with the lobster --  sweet sections poached in thyme broth wound around tangy lemongrass risotto. Green masala accented a grilled pork chop and a nut mixture spiced the blandness of its sweet potato garnish, underscoring the breadth of traditions on which Mr. Tsai draws. My fork having made the rounds, I found myself jealously hoarding my Indonesian curry pasta, especially the tiny, sweet coconut shrimp and crisp vegetables hidden in its turmeric-coated strands.</p>
        <p>Flourless bittersweet chocolate cake elicited the same reaction, and its accompanying cardamom ice cream lent a delicious and fragrant footnote. Asia doesn't have the Western dessert tradition, so Mr. Tsai and Marina Brancely, his pastry chef, have extemporized, refining workaday rice pudding into a voluptuous, jasmine-scented treat and offering sorbets with flavors like lychee-coconut and prickly pear -- this last, with its chunks of fruit, the very shade of pink I've always intended to paint my boudoir. The hearty substance of our 1998 Chilean merlot, Casa Lapostolle ($42), suited all of us.</p>
        <p>Service at Blue Ginger accents its bistro style, with the young staff recommending dishes and joshing customers as it deftly sweeps away the very empty white plates.</p>
        <p>Lumiere</p>
        <p>At Lumiere in West Newton, Michael Leviton serves unabashedly French food. He is a local boy who made good -- locally. Indeed Mr. Leviton admits that as a kid he patronized the ice cream shop his restaurant has now replaced. During the interval he graduated from Wesleyan University and did a traditional round of apprenticeships in San Francisco and New York.</p>
        <p>In the mom-and-pop bistro tradition, Mr. Leviton, 35, minds the stoves while his wife, Jill, handles the front of the house. Out of respect for the restaurant's location opposite the local movie house, they named the restaurant in homage to the medium's French inventors. When they opened a year and a half ago, they expected their clients to combine dinner with a movie, but have discovered that food as good as theirs is  reason enough to find a baby sitter.</p>
        <p>A bronze spoon serves as handle for the glass door to Lumiere. The restaurant glows rather than blazes, with light refracting from funky sheet music sconces in the first room and filtering through overhead swags in the second. Austere white tablecloths and flat paint set off fanciful burgundy cut-velvet banquettes. Regulars, who keep standing reservations, vie with romantic couples for the 65 seats. The menu changes weekly, though by popular demand two starters -- arugula salad with shaved fennel, cremini mushrooms and Asiago, and seared scallops with exotic mushrooms and potato mousseline -- are fixtures.</p>
        <p>Mr. Leviton's food is as up-to-the-minute as the last flight from Paris.  On our most recent visit, the lobster mango salad was layered with baby spinach and citrusy Thai vinaigrette and the hefty, rich cylinder of foie gras set off by tendrils of upland cress and zingy rhubarb-ginger ''jam.'' Swirls of pistou and cream enhanced rather than engulfed gutsy asparagus-based vegetable soup.  Melting lamb shoulder with roasted garlic creamed spinach and peppers took on Moroccan sunshine with the addition of preserved lemon and couscous. The lamb, like Lumiere's superb beef, comes from Niman Ranch, and easily justified ordering a 1997 David Bruce Sonoma County ($45). Mr. Leviton's time working for  the late Gilbert LeCoze at Le Bernardin in New York shines through in dishes like the roasted cod (after all, West Newton is only about eight miles west of Boston) atop a magnificent mess of exotic mushrooms and crunchy green beans. Not everything works perfectly. The bacon garnish's smokiness overwhelmed the herb-basted salmon, and chicken and mashed potatoes -- here refined with pea ragout and thyme jus -- though tender, were curiously bland. A crisp and classy 1999 Stoneleigh sauvignon blanc ($35) had to supply the flint.</p>
        <p>The pastry under the apple galette shattered under the fork -- all the better to combine with the accompanying mascarpone sorbet and bourbon caramel. On the other hand, the apricot tarte Tatin's pastry seemed disproportionately thick. Creme brulee was a classic, cloudlike under its caramel and long on vanilla. And the chocolate cake. . . . I only thought I could swear off such indulgence.  Looking up from my Moroccan mint tea, I kept catching contented faces shining in the mirrored frieze running above the banquettes.</p>
        <p>Yanks</p>
        <p>In keeping with its location in one of the North Shore's most grand yet understated communities, Yanks has crept quietly on the scene with a whimper not a bang. David and Sherri Bergmann spent two and half years persuading Beverly Farms' town fathers to permit a restaurant, opening the doors of their reincarnated Cadillac-Packard dealership in March 1999. Their architect, Douglas F. Trees, had split the space into two rooms, a mirrored bar seating 48 and a long, beige dining room seating 54.  The bar, especially, has a cool gloss that makes it a favorite with younger diners, who huddle on stools around the high tables. On Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays a jazz pianist near the entrance underscores the 40's-style glamour. The dining room is quieter, gleaming with white tablecloths, high-backed maple chairs and discreet halogen lighting.</p>
        <p>David Bergmann grew up outside  New York, while Sherri is from Los Angeles. He began his career in journalism and public relations, while she catered. Both had always imagined owning a restaurant. To conjure the sorts of dinners they wanted in the gastronomic desert north of Boston, they hired Erhard Wendt, 45, who earned his American reputation as executive chef at Pascal in Newport Beach, Calif.</p>
        <p>We shared dinner at Yanks with friends not long ago, starting with lush duck confit cut with lightly dressed greens, tomato and feta; an earthy, pistachio-studded country pate with shallot marmalade; and rare tuna with a black peppercorn-coriander crust. All were excellent, but the marinated salmon with lemon-dill oil was the must-have. Buttery salmon arrived draped across an ambrosial ''risotto'' of tiny potato dice.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wendt, who is from Westphalia, Germany, is prepared to reacquaint the olive oil and arugula brigade with cream and butter. On his menu, classic renditions of lobster bisque and of mushroom ragout served in a pastry case redeem a lifetime of frozen. Portions are manageable, so there's no need to overdose. If health or habit require low-fat, the field greens salad is a model of its kind, and the kitchen will cheerfully deconstruct dishes.</p>
        <p>Potatoes get star billing at Yanks, crusting Atlantic salmon and, mashed with white truffle, accompanying sauteed scallops. The salmon looks delectable alongside acid-sweet, crinkly Savoy cabbage -- and is. The scallops, pinwheeled around a spinach-stuffed portabello mushroom and sauced in saffron, are the most popular item on the menu. The braised rabbit's rich, old-fashioned mustard sauce was so tantalizing that our guest grabbed bread to mop up after he'd demolished both noodles and roasted vegetables. Lemony gremolata and brine-cured olives made a rare rack of lamb into a delicious Mediterranean creation.</p>
        <p>The Bergmanns take deserved pride in their (nearly) all-American wine list. Among its good values, we enjoyed a 1997 Meridian syrah from Paso Robles ($33), a stylish estate-bottled 1997 Chalk Hill sauvignon blanc from Sonoma ($46) and the 1996 Bethel Heights pinot noir ($40).</p>
        <p>Under the guise of ''chocolate truffle cake,'' a near-souffle emerged from the kitchen. We all dipped spoons in the molten chocolate that spilled forth to sauce its crisp shell.  Warm apple-crumble cake, though correct, couldn't hold a candle to it, any more than it could compete with the phyllo triangles plump with citrus-curd atop blueberry sauce.</p>
        <p>Distinguished as the food is, it's the details at Yanks that linger in the mind: the warm breads, the cylinder of lemon halves arranged as a still life in the ladies' room and the discovery that, instead of a phone booth, Sherri Bergmann insisted on an antique phone in the vestibule, so customers can make local calls without groping for quarters.</p>
        <p>Clam Box</p>
        <p>New Englanders like a good argument about culinary fine points. Tossing a recipe for chowder into a crowd is as effective as any apple of discord.  Ask, even rhetorically, who purveys the best fried clams, and you can set a room bubbling faster than a Fry-o-lator. In the certainty of controversy, I nominate the Clam Box in Ipswich, a standard-bearer since 1938. Nor would I be alone, if the crammed parking lot and the line winding around its gray clam-box-shaped building one recent Sunday afternoon are any measure. Every person I asked as I snaked forward agreed that fried clams were an essential, if guilty, pleasure of summer.</p>
        <p>Twenty minutes of anticipation got us to the window to order far more than we could decently finish: clams, oysters, calamari, onion rings and, for good measure, a lobster roll. Order number in hand, we corralled a red Leatherette banquette in the trapezoidal dining room (where no alcohol is served). Within minutes, lunch arrived on red plastic trays, with coleslaw and tiny paper cups of oniony tartar sauce on the side.</p>
        <p>What makes great fried clams?  Pudgy, salt-sassy fresh clams, of course. But batter and fat also play a pivotal role. The Clam Box's combination of pastry flour (for its adhesive qualities), yellow cornmeal (for flavor) and a frying medium of meat fat and vegetable oil produces the lightest, tastiest result. The same mixture works wonders with the other seafood, not to mention the irresistible Spanish onion rings.</p>
        <p>My capacity is never equal to my appetite, so inevitably I staggered away from the Clam Box supersated, but once I've made amends with my scale, I will return.</p>
