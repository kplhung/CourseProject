        <p>IT has been nine months since Danuta Trojanowska, 56, first became ill with the West Nile virus. But she is still lying in a bed at New York United Hospital in Port Chester, unable to walk, her muscles so atrophied that she cannot even turn in her bed. A housekeeper with prominent cheekbones and long dark hair, she spends her days watching soap operas and reading Danielle Steel novels translated into Polish, her native language.</p>
        <p>If Ms. Trojanowska had private health insurance, or had access to standard Medicaid, she would have left the hospital months ago for a rehabilitation program, which would be far less expensive and, her relatives believe, might have restored her to health by now.</p>
        <p>But because of a quirk in the government's medical insurance system, she is not eligible for the kind of care she needs. Instead, she remains in her spacious hospital room, with its separate bathroom and large picture window, at taxpayer expense.</p>
        <p>''Each day she spends in the hospital is a setback for her,'' said Ms. Trojanowska's sister, Barbara Glowacki, who lives in Port Chester and has helped care for her sister since she first became ill. Ms. Trojanowska receives 10 to 15 minutes of physical therapy a day, she said, but that is not nearly enough to improve her condition.</p>
        <p>The hospital concedes that Ms. Trojanowska would be better served in a long-term care facility, but it insists she is getting all the physical therapy she needs.</p>
        <p>Tere Pettitt, the hospital's chief operating officer, said that at the height of her illness, the cost of Ms. Trojanowska's care was between $1,200 and $2,100 a day, though it is ''less today because her condition is more stable.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Trojanowska emigrated from Poland 18 years ago and has been paying taxes for nine years, but she does not have a green card. She is therefore eligible only for Emergency Medicaid, which does not cover rehabilitation services -- even though her income qualifies her for the full range of Medicaid services.</p>
        <p>The same restriction applies to roughly 500,000 low-income legal immigrants in the New York area who arrived after Aug. 22, 1996, said Mark Lewis of the New York Immigration Coalition. Because of a provision in the 1996 Welfare Reform bill, immigrants who arrived after that date are eligible only for Emergency Medicaid. Perhaps a third of those immigrants have access to private health insurance, Mr. Lewis said.</p>
        <p>As summer approaches and another potential outbreak of the mosquito-borne West Nile virus looms, Ms. Trojanowska's plight could be a warning about the risks the uninsured face. The virus caused seven deaths and 62 cases of encephalitis in the New York region last summer. Nine cases and a death were in Westchester.</p>
        <p>The virus is particularly dangerous to people with prior health problems or compromised immune systems, said Dr. James Morris, a neurologist at New York United. And recovery can take months.</p>
        <p>Ms. Trojanowska's first symptom was arthritis, in late August.</p>
        <p>''I thought it was just legs not working,'' she said in heavily accented English. She had had trouble with her legs before, though the problem had not been diagnosed, and she was in good health at the time.</p>
        <p>On Sept. 10 she developed a rash and a fever and went to the hospital. She was treated and sent home. That night her fever worsened, and she was unable to move -- two of the warning signs of West Nile infection. Her sister's children drove her from her home in Port Chester to the hospital, and soon a spinal tap confirmed West Nile.</p>
        <p>In early October Ms. Trojanowska was transferred to the intensive-care unit and put on a respirator. One night the doctors almost gave up hope, Mrs. Glowacki said. ''We did everything we could,'' she said. ''It was up to God. She lived through the night.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Trojanowska remained on the respirator for two months, a period about which she remembers nothing. ''There were times when she should have died, it was so bad,'' her sister said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Trojanowska's doctors would not discuss her case beyond confirming the West Nile diagnosis, citing the hospital's policy on patients. In November the hospital transferred her to the Dumont Masonic Home, a nursing home in New Rochelle with a rehabilitation unit. But she was returned to the hospital, apparently after administrators at Dumont learned she was on Emergency Medicaid and her bills would not be covered.</p>
        <p>By December, she had recovered substantially, regaining her mental clarity and some muscular control. ''As soon as she could use her hands, she made this hat,'' her sister said, holding up a bright red and green wool hat. But she could still not use her legs. And six months later, she has made little progress. ''Now I can use hands, a little bit legs, that's it,'' she said. ''I still don't have muscles.''</p>
        <p>She has become more religious since she became sick, she said. A Catholic, she prays frequently and watches Mass on television on Sundays. The doctors have also given her antidepressants to counter her melancholy. Above all, she wants to get out of the hospital and return to her old life.</p>
        <p>''I would like to be working,'' she said. ''I need to be working. My brain will be crazy.''</p>
        <p>Her sister believes that the key to recovery is better rehabilitative care. ''If she could have aggressive physical therapy she could be O.K.,'' Ms. Glowacki said. ''Instead she's taking up space in a hospital. One room, her own bathroom. Why not pay for a rehab center?''</p>
        <p>Kerry Walsh, New York United's vice president of external affairs, said, ''We have made several attempts at several levels of government to discuss the patient's situation, and we believe our concerns are being heard and addressed.''</p>
        <p>A State Health Department spokesman, Robert Kenney, said the department was aware of Ms. Trojanowska's case and was following federal guidelines, which are set by the Health Care Financing Administration.</p>
        <p>Ms. Trojanowska is not afraid of the virus anymore; it has already done its damage, she said. But her sister said she is anxious about another possible outbreak. ''We need to warn people to be very cautious about what's going to happen in the summer,'' she said. ''When my daughter sees a mosquito, she runs inside.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Trojanowska said she thinks she got West Nile because she spent so much time outdoors. ''It was so hot,'' she said. ''After 3 o'clock I am outside, until almost 12 o'clock.''</p>
