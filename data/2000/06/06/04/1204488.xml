        <p>Carjackers forced Peter Behr to strip to his underpants. One kicked him in the face. Another shoved a pistol in his mouth. A third put a hunting knife to the throat of his 15-year-old son.</p>
        <p>After commandeering his Mazda outside a shopping complex in Nairobi, the carjackers became annoyed. Their hearts had been set on a Toyota. When they discovered their mistake, they drove it and its occupants to the outskirts of Kenya's capital and vented their displeasure by pistol-whipping Behr and his son, Glen. The robbers then walked away, leaving man and boy bloodied, but with the car keys.</p>
        <p>The Behrs drove straight to a police station. When the Kenyan police found out that the Mazda had not been stolen and that its owner and his son were neither dead nor dying, they said, in effect, no harm, no foul.</p>
        <p>''They didn't want to know,'' whispered Behr, 47, a third-generation Kenyan who retired as a white hunter when going after big game was banned 23 years ago and is now a safari guide. ''I have been jumped by a leopard, but nothing was as scary as that day.''</p>
        <p>He whispered his hijack story because he was at work. We were sitting together in his Land Rover in the middle of a herd of about 60 elephants grazing in the Masai Mara game reserve. It was dawn, the air was still and the footfalls of the elephants were utterly silent. The only noise they made was when they wrapped their trunks around clumps of dew-drenched grass, ripping them from the earth. This was background music to the white hunter's sotto voce story about his adventures with the Nairobi criminals four years ago.</p>
        <p>When I visited Peter Behr and his wife, Louise, at Masai Mara early this year, it seemed as if the animals had come together on the mile-high equatorial plain and decided to throw a party. Soft rains had delayed the coming of the dry season. The grass was wondrously green, like Midwest wheat fields in the blush of spring. Gazelles chased each other on the plain. Fat lions slept in the grass. The reserve, just a half hour by air from Nairobi, was all dressed up for what should have been prime time in the tourist season.</p>
        <p>But there was hardly a human around.</p>
        <p>During the two nights I spent there, 9 out of 10 beds at two of the best-known luxury safari camps in the reserve were empty. At Behr's small but splendid camp beside the Mara River, called Olonana, there were just two tourists -- and they were there by sheer chance. A tour operator had sent them to the Behrs' after their walking safari in another Kenyan game reserve had been canceled for lack of people.</p>
        <p>There is a link, of course, between the lack of paying customers in paradise and the carjacking that haunts Behr. It's a canary-in-the-coal-mine connection. The decline of tourism tracks the decline of nearly everything in Kenya.</p>
        <p>Kenya was once a celebrated exception to the rule of misrule in sub-Saharan Africa. When I lived in Nairobi and traveled across the continent as a reporter in the second half of the 1980's, it was always a relief to come home. Kenya simply worked better than the rest of black-ruled Africa. It had the best roads, the best communications and the best public school system in the region. There was no ethnic violence. Coffee, tea and tourism were all profitable, growing and sustainable industries.</p>
        <p>When I returned to Kenya this year after an 11-year absence, the change was staggering. Roads were in ruins, telephones barely worked during business hours and the school system was on the verge of collapse.</p>
        <p>As a result, the Western governments and investors that had lavished so much attention on Kenya, particularly during the cold war, had turned their backs on the country. After years of daily flights, Lufthansa and Air France had halted passenger service. Foreign investment fell 500 percent in the 1990's. Major donors, including the United States, had all but ended aid to the government.</p>
        <p>Major indicators of social well-being, from infant mortality to life expectancy, had rolled backward. Violent disputes over land between rival tribes, often involving automatic weapons, had become routine. The coffee and tea industries were in decline because of corrupt management that allowed the state to bleed profits from farmers.</p>
        <p>Most important, earnings from tourism, a cornerstone of the economy and a key source of foreign currency, had slid nearly 40 percent in five years. Half the country's tourist beds had gone empty since 1997. Kenya lost its dominance in the African safari trade, according to American travel agents, as many travelers opted for game-drive vacations in Botswana, South Africa and Tanzania. The slide was worst along the Indian Ocean, where dozens of beach hotels were closed and many were on the edge of bankruptcy. Along the coast, about 84,000 tourist-related jobs were lost, affecting the lives of about 700,000 people, according to Mike Kirkland, a tourist operator in Mombasa and vice chairman of the Kenya Tourism Federation.</p>
        <p>What happened?</p>
        <p>It is one of Africa's most familiar -- and saddest -- stories since self-rule spread across the continent in the 1960's. A one-man regime ruined the country to preserve itself. President Daniel arap Moi, who is in his mid-70's and has been in office for 22 years, ran his country into the ground so that he might have a few more years in power. Kenya's fall is especially disturbing because it could easily have been averted. Moi's government strangled an economy that was vibrantly alive. It fomented ethnic violence where there was none, triggering tribal bloodshed during election years that drove tens of thousands of opposition voters from their homes. Displaced Kenyans didn't vote, and Moi won disputed elections in 1992 and 1997. In the process, he crippled a tourist industry that thrived on the passion of travelers who were enchanted by Kenya and who went home to spread the word about an African paradise.</p>
        <p>Crime, which has been scaring off foreign tourists for years, has reached a level that alarms many Kenyans. The Standard, a Kenyan daily, wrote in an editorial this year that residents of Nairobi ''yearn for the days when they only dreaded nightfall. These days women are raped in broad daylight, muggings pass unnoticed, murders are committed with relative impunity, while carjackings are now the rule rather than the exception.''</p>
        <p>When I read that editorial, it struck me as a bit over the top. But when I walked across Nairobi on a Saturday morning to pick up an airplane ticket, I wandered into a shootout. An all-night police chase for robbers who had raided a Nairobi nightclub the previous evening was drawing to a noisy climax not far from the front door of Let's Go Travel, where my ticket was waiting. Five men with AK-47's, bulletproof vests and a stolen powder-blue BMW were battling about a hundred Kenyan police officers. After an hour or so of wild gunfire, two robbers were shot dead and three ran off.</p>
        <p>That afternoon, students at the University of Nairobi rioted for the third day running. What got them started was an attack by ruling-party thugs on opposition members of Parliament. Kenyan policemen had stood by and allowed the thugs to beat up the opposition lawmakers. Then the policemen arrested the lawmakers.</p>
        <p>University students have a hair trigger when it comes to riots. The economy has been shrinking for years while the population has grown, unemployment is about 45 percent and the students' chances of finding a decent job are next to nil.</p>
        <p>To prevent students from busting up the Norfolk Hotel, which abuts the university and is the oldest tourist establishment in Nairobi, security guards with clubs took up positions in front of the hotel's Lord Delamere Veranda. White tourists, most of them Americans kitted out in khaki, retreated from the veranda to the hotel bar, where some of them drank tea and tried to concentrate on books about a gracious Kenya that used to be.</p>
        <p>Their preferred diversion was ''Out of Africa,'' Karen Blixen's memoir of a coffee farm she owned in the 1920's at the foot of the Ngong Hills. Those hills are just a few miles from the hotel, where the tourists, who had come to Africa for safaris that recreate the colonial past, were struggling to ignore the shouts of rioting students who fear they have no future.</p>
        <p>When I moved to Nairobi in 1985, the film version of ''Out of Africa,'' which starred Meryl Streep and won the Oscar for best movie, had just been shot on location in Kenya. When I returned this year, another big-budget movie, ''I Dreamed of Africa,'' starring Kim Basinger, had also just been filmed. It, too, was based on a memoir about living on a farm in Kenya. But for security reasons it could not be shot inside the country.</p>
        <p>Travelers, most of them white and many with money to burn, have been part of the economic backbone of Kenya since the turn of the century.</p>
        <p>The Swahili word ''safari'' entered popular American usage after Theodore Roosevelt arrived in 1909 and hired 500 porters to follow him into the bush with everything from collapsible bathtubs to cases of Champagne. Soon thereafter, socialites, plutocrats, maharajas, royalty and movie stars began to parade across Kenya. It was easy to understand why. ''You emerged into thousands of acres of rolling English parkland, a haze of blue lawn rising and falling to the horizon, untouched by the plow and apparently uninhabited,'' wrote James Fox in ''White Mischief,'' an account of upper-class British shenanigans in highland Kenya in the 1920's and 30's.</p>
        <p>Kenya aroused newcomers, as Fox describes it, with ''an ecstasy of well-being.'' In one highland enclave called Happy Valley, not far from Nairobi, more than a few white settlers succumbed to what became known as ''the three A's'' -- altitude, alcohol and adultery. They swanked around Kenya with huge staffs of servants that they could never have afforded back home, getting dressed up to bet on the ponies at Nairobi racecourses and undressed to swap wives at each other's country homes. A joke ruined by repeated telling asked, ''Are you married or do you live in Kenya?''</p>
        <p>By the 1980's, Kenyan entrepreneurs had perfected the high-end safari. They were helped along by ''Out of Africa,'' which transformed the upper-crust safari into a booming business that, at its height in the late 80's and early 90's, brought in about a third of Kenya's hard-currency earnings. The ''product,'' as tourist operators call Kenya's natural offerings, had become an expensive fantasy that was part Happy Valley, part Hollywood and part Ralph Lauren: balloon rides at dawn over the wildebeest migration, followed by a Champagne breakfast, followed by a nap in a tent with a hot shower and flush toilet. Bush boutiques selling crisp cotton outfits of the sort that Meryl Streep/Karen Blixen wore when she had a farm in Africa. Nouvelle cuisine dinners served in candlelit mess tents by Masai waiters with impossibly high cheekbones. The smell of wood smoke, the perfume of frangipani and somewhere in the near distance -- the chance of white mischief.</p>
        <p>This is the kind of fantasy that Peter and Louise Behr were selling -- or trying to sell -- when I visited them at their camp. Even though the place was nearly empty, they maintained five-star standards in the bush. ''Here is your shampoo, your conditioner and your shower gel,'' said Maurice Tissah, the steward who showed me to my tent on a high bank above the Mara River. The tent was the size of a pricey hotel suite in Paris and was done up 1920's style, with new but old-looking steamer trunks, brass lanterns, a pasha-style pull rope that turned on the lights and diaphanous folds of mosquito netting encircling two king-size beds. After I showered with hot water (using the gel), I sat out on the porch of my tent, watching hippos gambol in the river. The sun was just beginning to slide out of sight, replaced by a slight crepuscular chill, when the steward returned to ask, ''My friend, do you need a hot-water bottle?''</p>
        <p>The next morning, during our game drive, Behr told me that the safari trade was unlikely to survive. He said insecurity had taken too firm a hold in Kenya for tourism to recover. His son, now 19, has shown interest in becoming a safari guide, but Behr has warned him off. ''He has a job now in the automobile-suspension business,'' said Behr, without bothering to explain about the country's fast-crumbling roads. ''Suspension is a good, growing business these days.''</p>
        <p>In 1997, when state-sponsored, election-year tribal violence exploded along the Kenyan coast, the International Monetary Fund got fed up with Moi. Citing corruption and poor governance, the I.M.F. suspended its $220 million aid program. Nearly all donor money to the government has since dried up. Without aid or tourism, Kenya's economy went dead in the water. ''Moi pays a lot of attention to where the money comes from, and the fact that a lot of the money dried up was not lost on him,'' says Harold Wackman, director of the World Bank in Kenya.</p>
        <p>Desperate to get the money flowing again, Moi appointed a sworn enemy, Richard E. Leakey, the famous paleoanthropologist and conservationist, to head the civil service and clean up corruption in Kenya. Five years ago, Moi accused Leakey of being a racist, a colonialist and a foreigner. (Leakey is a third-generation Kenyan.) Thugs from Moi's ruling party attacked and flogged Leakey, who had founded an opposition party and was considering a run for the presidency. And yet last July Moi made Leakey the second most powerful man in the country.</p>
        <p>If nothing else, Moi's choice of Leakey as a corruption-buster was a masterstroke of public relations. It intrigued donors, giving Moi's government more credibility than it has had in a decade. Western diplomats regarded Leakey as the Kenyan least likely to be played by Moi for a fool. And since he took over the civil service, there have been impressive improvements in the way the government keeps track of money and in the quality of people appointed to run key government agencies, like the port of Mombasa. ''With tremendous support from Moi, Leakey has done quite a lot of things,'' says Wackman, who added that he expects the World Bank and I.M.F. to resume lending to Kenya this summer.</p>
        <p>Moi also got serious as never before about luring back tourists. He named his closest adviser and longtime business associate, Nicholas Biwott, as minister of tourism, trade and industry. Biwott is no Leakey. He is tainted by allegations of corruption and has been accused of involvement in the murder of a rival who, at the time of his death, happened to be Kenya's foreign minister. Biwott's appointment suggests that while Moi is more interested than ever before in reviving tourism, he is not all that keen on fundamental change in the way his regime does business. Many skeptical Kenyans believe that Biwott has the president's ear, while Leakey is merely window dressing for the donors.</p>
        <p>When I arrived in Nairobi, I asked to see Biwott and was ushered into his office less than 12 hours later. This was a shock. When I was writing critical stories about Kenya in the late 80's, Biwott stood on the floor of Parliament and denounced me by name as ''the well-known girlfriend'' of South African spies. When I telephoned him then to explain that I was a man, he paused for a long time, chuckled and said we must get together soon, but refused ever to see me -- until tourism took a nose dive and Moi told him to fix it.</p>
        <p>I walked the mile or so from my hotel to Biwott's office in Harambee House, the government building where important ministers work. Downtown sidewalks were crowded with young Kenyans, most of them men, who have nothing to do. ''Idlers,'' as they are called, dominate the street life of Nairobi. They are the principal reasons why hotels and Western embassies advise tourists to stay off the streets after dark. A large, fidgety crowd of idlers waited in the lobby of Harambee House for two elevators, one of which was out of order. So I climbed 11 flights to Biwott's office, weaving my way up through scores of young men who were standing, sitting and napping in the stairwells.</p>
        <p>Biwott, a short, gray, gimlet-eyed man in a bright blue suit, was precisely on time. During more than two hours of conversation, he was invariably polite, even a bit wistful. I didn't have the heart to bring up the business about the South African spies. ''I think we squandered quite a bit,'' he said, referring to Kenya's lost reputation. ''We need to work with the international press. It is that negative publicity that has killed us. That is why I am very, very pleased to receive you.''</p>
        <p>A number of major tourist operators had told me that Biwott was the hardest-working minister of tourism Kenya has ever had. He has real power in Moi's regime, they said, and he was using it to beef up security for tourists and promote Kenya at international tourist conventions. ''Biwott is the best minister of tourism in 25 years,'' says Mahmud Jan Mohamed, chairman of the Kenya Tourism Federation and managing director of Serena Hotels, the largest chain of safari lodges in East Africa.</p>
        <p>Still, Biwott has an international reputation as one of Kenya's most corrupt ministers. An anticorruption committee in Parliament included his name this spring on its ''List of Shame.'' Kenyan newspapers report that he is obsessed with security, frequently switching cars when traveling and never accepting drinks brought to him in restaurants. He refused to tell me his age.</p>
        <p>During his 10 years as minister of energy, Biwott was linked in the Kenyan press with a number of kickback schemes and noncompetitive contracts awarded to companies in which he had an interest. Even worse, he became a prime suspect in the 1990 murder of the Kenyan foreign minister, Robert Ouko. As a result, Moi fired Biwott and later ordered him arrested. But after a short stint in jail and a slightly longer stay in the political doghouse, Biwott returned to the good graces of the president, a fellow member of the Kalenjin tribe. The murder remains unsolved.</p>
        <p>To help Moi win re-election in 1992, Biwott paid Kalenjin youths to start ethnic clashes with rival tribes, according to testimony given at a parliamentary inquiry into the violence. The violence has continued off and on ever since and is a major reason why tourists have been scared away from Kenya. As Biwott smiled wanly, I asked him about the charges of corruption, murder and fomenting violence that terrified tourists. Who was he, I asked, to put a welcoming face on Kenya? ''All these perceptions are false,'' he said, without raising his voice or seeming annoyed. ''I am neither powerful not corrupt. I could be efficient. I do my work diligently, according to rules and procedures.''</p>
        <p>I asked about the apparent conflict of interest involved in his being in charge of tourism. He owns Air Kenya, an airline that with the collapse of the road system has become the lifeline of the safari industry. He also has major interests in a number of tourist hotels and lodges. ''When we are in government, we don't get involved in private business,'' he said, his smile tightening.</p>
        <p>Although numbers are down, wealthy tourists continue to travel to Masai Mara. Almost none of them, though, go by car. They fly out from Nairobi, usually on Biwott's Air Kenya planes, skipping six spine-crunching hours on bad roads.</p>
        <p>But they also miss a journey I regard as one of the marvels of Africa. From Nairobi, the road climbs 2,000 feet up the Kikuyu escarpment to where the air has the bracing purity of the Scottish highlands. The rolling hills are covered with the unearthly Day-Glo green of ripening tea. Then, quite suddenly, the road comes to what seems to be the edge of the earth -- the eastern wall of the Great Rift Valley.</p>
        <p>Far below, down through the heat rising from the floor of the valley, dormant volcanoes march off into an impossibly distant horizon. Switchbacks on a steep downhill grade slow traffic to a crawl. Baboons take advantage, scurrying around on the side of the road, begging for handouts.</p>
        <p>Descending to the Rift, the equatorial sun doesn't so much shine as strike. The heat becomes stupefying. Masai herdsmen lie fast asleep at midday under the scrawny shade of acacia trees as their cows share pastureland with zebras.</p>
        <p>Having been away from Kenya for so long, I had forgotten the country's capacity to inspire wonder. During the long, dusty drive, I found myself making plans to return to Kenya for a vacation. I wanted to believe that Biwott and Moi and maybe even Leakey could somehow work together to reverse Kenya's decline, revive living standards and make the country safe for tourists.</p>
        <p>When I got out of the sun, I got over it.</p>
