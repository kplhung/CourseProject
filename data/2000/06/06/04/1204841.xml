        <p>The simmering five-year debate over the way ''60 Minutes'' handled a controversial report about the tobacco industry heated up again yesterday as the show's executive producer attacked Lowell Bergman, a former ''60 Minutes'' producer and longtime investigative reporter, in a speech to more than 1,000 journalists in New York.</p>
        <p>Don Hewitt, the executive producer, said that Mr. Bergman should not be allowed ''within a hundred miles of a newsroom.''</p>

        <p>The simmering five-year debate over the way ''60 Minutes'' handled a controversial report about the tobacco industry heated up again yesterday as the show's executive producer attacked Lowell Bergman, a former ''60 Minutes'' producer and longtime investigative reporter, in a speech to more than 1,000 journalists in New York.</p>
        <p>Don Hewitt, the executive producer, said that Mr. Bergman should not be allowed ''within a hundred miles of a newsroom.''</p>
        <p>When Mr. Hewitt opened the floor to questions, supporters of Mr. Bergman responded angrily to Mr. Hewitt's comments, sparking a spirited debate that continued after the speech. Matters came to a head when David Fanning, a friend of Mr. Bergman, confronted Mr. Hewitt and Mike Wallace, the ''60 Minutes'' correspondent, as a thick crowd knotted around the men.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fanning argued that Mr. Bergman should have been given a chance to respond to Mr. Hewitt's comments, especially since they came at the annual meeting of Investigative Reporters and Editors, an organization to which Mr. Bergman has belonged essentially since its inception in 1975. After several minutes of debate, Mr. Wallace and Mr. Hewitt broke off from Mr. Fanning and left.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hewitt's criticism stems from the way he and Mr. Wallace, a television legend, were portrayed in ''The Insider,'' a 1999 movie about the way the CBS program handled the report on the tobacco industry in 1995. Mr. Bergman consulted on the film, which cast him as a principled reporter who eventually quit his job over CBS's handling of the report, while portraying Mr. Hewitt as more concerned with CBS's stock price than the truth. Mr. Bergman has been a respected investigative reporter for a generation, and is a contract freelancer and consultant for The New York Times.</p>
        <p>The controversy highlights the potential for corporate censorship in journalism at a time when a handful of major media companies control much of what is seen and heard by consumers, as well as the responsibility that reporters have when Hollywood fictionalizes their stories.</p>
        <p>In his speech, at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, Mr. Hewitt said that ''The Insider'' portrayed him dishonestly and that Mr. Bergman had a responsibility to make sure that the story the movie told was accurate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hewitt said he had stood up to his bosses at CBS for the report, and that it would only have been broadcast in the form Mr. Bergman preferred if Mr. Hewitt and Mr. Wallace had hired ''a band of guerrillas'' to take over a CBS television station and broadcast the report themselves. By turning himself into a hero and portraying Mr. Hewitt as a toady, Mr. Bergman lied, destroying his credibility as a journalist, Mr. Hewitt said.</p>
        <p>Reached at his home in Berkeley, Calif., Mr. Bergman said he did not have control of ''The Insider,'' but he said he believed Mr. Hewitt had ''gotten off lightly'' in the movie.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bergman said he believed self-censorship and advertiser pressure on television news is a serious and growing problem, but said that fact did not excuse Mr. Hewitt's actions on the tobacco industry report.</p>
        <p>''Maybe he couldn't have'' gotten the story to run, Mr. Bergman said of Mr. Hewitt, but ''he didn't try.''</p>
