        <p>Reductions in electricity rates by the Long Island Power Authority have expanded the Long Island economy by $5 billion in the past two years, making it a $100 billion economy for the first time, an economist, Irwin Kellner, said last week.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kellner, a professor of economics at Hofstra University, made the estimate at ceremonies attended by Gov. George E. Pataki and Richard Kessel, the utility's chairman, held on Tuesday for LIPA's second anniversary.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki, who led the authority's partial takeover of the former Long Island Lighting Company, said the rate reductions, averaging 20 percent, ''benefited all Long Islanders, but especially small-business owners, who are the backbone of the local economy.'' He estimated direct savings from lower rates at nearly $1 billion over the two years.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kellner said the $5 billion figure took into account a multiplier effect that included new jobs and construction, business expansion and higher wages and disposable income. The unemployment rate on the Island is an extremely low 2.5 percent.</p>
        <p>He said more than a million workers on the Island were employed by private businesses, and that 40,000 jobs were added last year, the highest figure since 1985.</p>
        <p>Much of the savings in the partial takeover of Lilco resulted from refinancing of Lilco debt, including more than $4 billion for the Shoreham nuclear plant, which never opened, with tax-exempt state bonds.</p>
        <p>Critics of the takeover said repayment of the bonds over the next 30 years would eventually drive electric rates higher. They also said the authority could act on its own to raise rates at any time, unlike private utilities, whose rates were regulated by the New York State Public Service Commission.</p>
