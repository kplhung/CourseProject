      <abstract>
        <p>Research by University of Chicago prof Eugene F Fama and Massachusetts Institute of Technology prof Ken French casts doubt on prevailing consensus that stock market's 'expected return' averages out to annualized rate of between 10 percent and 15 percent over long term; Fama and French studied US stocks over last 130 years or so; they observed that average annual return was just 8.8 percent in period 1872 through 1949, but rose to 14.8 percent for period 1950 through 1999; Fama and French contend latter period marks exception, and former period marks norm; if correct, asset allocation models would have to be revised to cut equity weighting and great swaths of capital would need to be shifted to nonequity investments; graph (M)</p>

        <p>IT is a truism of the investing world: Over the long term stocks grow at an annualized rate of 10 to 15 percent.</p>
        <p>Sure, equities may do better in some decades, as they did in the 1980's and 1990's, just as they may do worse in others, say, the 1930's and 1960's. But, eventually, their long-term growth rate will level out within this range -- a rate economists know as the stock market's ''expected return.''</p>
        <p>This is the rate investors require to compensate them for the risk in equity investments, and it should remain relatively constant over the long term.</p>
        <p>But what if it turns out that we've all been too optimistic about the expected return of stocks? Then asset allocation models would have to be recalculated to cut their equity weightings. Indeed, huge swaths of capital would need to be shifted into nonequity asset classes. And certainly investing the Social Security Trust Fund in stocks, as George W. Bush and many others have proposed, would suddenly make a lot less sense.</p>
        <p>Well, two of this country's most influential finance professors, Eugene F. Fama of the University of Chicago and Ken French of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, have just completed research showing that the expected return from stocks is more than five percentage points a year lower than previously thought. Though this research has not yet been published, word of it is beginning to spread.</p>
        <p>Determining stocks' expected return isn't easy, since it requires viewing the markets over extremely long periods. Professors Fama and French focused on United States stocks over the last 130 or so years. In particular, they observed that the stock market's average annual return from 1950 through 1999, at 14.8 percent, was about 6 percentage points higher than it was from 1872 through 1949, when it was 8.8 percent.</p>
        <p>The key question: Which period represents the rule and which the exception?</p>
        <p>The professors are confident that the last 50 years constitute the exception. That means we're on shaky ground if we extrapolate recent decades' stellar returns into the future.</p>
        <p>One of their more compelling points is based on the fact that corporate America's average annual return on equity over the last 50 years has been 11.9 percent, nearly three percentage points lower than the stock market's average return over that period.</p>
        <p>This, the professors say, all but proves that stocks' expected return should be below what their historical return has been over the past five decades.</p>
        <p>Why is that? If the market's expected return is greater than a company's return on equity, the rational thing for the company to do is close up shop and invest its assets in the stock market. Alert balance sheet readers will note that, because the market's expected return is also the rate at which a company's future income stream is discounted for valuation purposes, the present value of such a company's future earnings would be negative.</p>
        <p>In other words, if you believe that stocks'  historical return over the last 50 years reflects their genuine expected return, then, in effect, you must also believe that corporate America on balance has been unprofitable on a discounted valuation basis over the past 50 years.</p>
        <p>The professors' point is that corporate America's returns on equity, on average, cannot have trailed the market's true expected return for five full decades.</p>
        <p>So investors have been overestimating the expected return from stocks: It should be no higher than their underlying companies' returns on equity, or three percentage points a year less than the equity market's annual return over the past 50 years.</p>
        <p>Moreover, returns on equity are widely assumed to be upwardly biased because they are based on artificially low book values. So even this overstates expected return.</p>
        <p>Why then have stocks bested what might be called their true expected return for 50 years? Likely, it is because they have benefited from some unexpected good news. The professors don't discuss what that good news was, but it undoubtedly includes America's emergence after World War II as an economic and political superpower and its winning of the cold war.</p>
        <p>The professors note that unexpected good news is just that -- unexpected -- and its salutary effect on past returns should not be extrapolated into the future. They don't predict a bear market, but argue that we need to cut our expectations of future stock market performance, not just for the next few years but in perpetuity.</p>

        <p>Correction:  June 11, 2000, Sunday  A chart last Sunday with the Strategies column, about the expected long-term return of stocks, misstated the average annual inflation rate for two periods. From 1872 through 1949 it was 0.9 percent, not 4.1. From 1950 through 1999 it was 4.1 percent, not 6.2.</p>
