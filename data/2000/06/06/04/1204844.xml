        <p>INTERNATIONAL</p>
        <p>3-14</p>
        <p>Clinton and Putin Meet In Prelude to Negotiations  President Clinton and Russia's new leader, Vladimir V. Putin, dined at the Kremlin palace where they began discussing a range of topics, including antimissile defense strategies, the ongoing conflicts in the Balkans and the Caucasus, international trade and the state of the Russian economy.</p>

        <p>Progressives Meet in Berlin  President Clinton met with 12 other left-of-center presidents and prime ministers in Berlin, who agreed that they all stood for a new brand of progressive leaders. But perhaps inevitably, most of the conclusions beyond that were murky.</p>

        <p>Europeans Pressure Poland  Having achieved full NATO membership only a year ago, Poland finds itself caught between its European aspirations and its loyalty to the United States. European officials, led by France, have pressured Poland to be more accommodating toward a new European defense initiative, senior Polish officials say.</p>

        <p>U.S. Absence in Sierra Leone  As Sierra Leone slid back into war last month, the British were conspicuous as the one Western power willing to shore up the United Nations peacekeeping force. To many, their presence merely emphasized the absence of the United States.</p>
        <p>6</p>
        <p>Report on Torture in Turkey  When a harsh report asserting that torture is widespread in Turkey was released, the surprise was not just the amount of damning evidence it contained, but also the source: the parliamentary committee on human rights. No report by a government human rights body has ever been this extensive or graphic.</p>

        <p>Food Companies Confront Biotechnology Quandary  The nation's biggest food companies face a marketing quandary in the debate over genetically altered crops, which environmentalists contend are potentially dangerous but which the Food and Drug Administration has deemed entirely safe. Though nearly all the big food producers publicly support biotechnology, a growing number are quietly limiting its use.</p>

        <p>Teacher Initiative Stalls  Gov. Gray Davis's proposal to show support for California's public school teachers by exempting them from state income taxes has met with widespread opposition. Even the teachers' unions, initially flattered, oppose the plan, which would reduce the average experienced teacher's state tax by about $1,350 a year.</p>

        <p>Detroit Braces for Protests  Human rights campaigners plan to unleash in Detroit the same kind of protests that left Seattle with $2.5 million in damage last December after a meeting of the World Trade Organization. The planned protests are directed at a three-day summit on trade being held by the Organization of American States across the Detroit River in Windsor, Ontario.</p>

        <p>Competing to Hire Students  The 1.2 million college graduates in the nation's class of 2000 are entering a strong job market, a result of the flourishing economy and, especially, the boom in high technology.</p>

        <p>Janitors Approve New Contract  Service Employees International Union Local 1877, representing janitors who clean more than 70 percent of the buildings in Silicon Valley, reached a contract agreement with cleaning contractors.</p>

        <p>In a Bronx Court Experiment, Youths Get Juries of Peers  In a quiet experiment in Family Court in the Bronx, teenagers arrested on misdemeanor charges and even minor felonies -- anything from graffiti writing to small-time robberies and drug sales -- are being judged, quite literally, by a jury of their peers. All first-time defendants, the youths are referred as an alternative to prosecution.</p>

        <p>Third Parties' Endorsements  With as much relief as enthusiasm, New York's Conservative and Liberal parties reverted to type, endorsing Rick Lazio and Hillary Rodham Clinton for the Senate, after both parties had endured several queasy months that left their nominations in doubt.</p>

        <p>Health Officials' Concern  Though health officials in New York say they are seeing more exotic diseases, they also must turn the public's attention to the more mundane diseases that emerge each year.</p>

        <p>William E. Simon  The treasury secretary in the dark economic days of the 1970's who also directed the nation's energy policy and proved to have a golden touch as an investor in the boom days of the 1980's, he was 72.</p>
