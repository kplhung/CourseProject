        <p>FOR years the United States has classified some countries, like Iraq and North Korea, as ''rogue states.'' Now, as the world becomes more democratic -- more than 60 percent of countries have elected leaders -- something more complicated enters the political lexicon. Call them ''rogue democracies.''</p>
        <p>These are democratic governments that go off the rails, either in aggressiveness toward neighbors, cruelty to citizens or backtracking on the promise that democracy will foster liberty and equality.</p>
        <p>How to deal with this new type of rogue, or to know when to recognize one, is not easy for established democracies. It is, after all, tempting to assume that when other nations choose to freely elect their leaders, good things automatically follow.</p>
        <p>The case of Peru is the latest example. There an elected president, Alberto K. Fujimori, has rewritten the constitution, cut the power of his Congress and chipped away at political liberties, all in the name of social order. Now he is claiming a third term after an election so riddled with irregularities that the opposition boycotted it and the Organization of American States won't approve it.</p>
        <p>What's the world to do? Shun Peru? Impose sanctions? When Austria's voters put the xenophobe Jorg Haider near the seat of power, Europe got together and forced his ostracism. But in Peru a similar outcome seems unlikely.</p>
        <p>It has been obvious for some time that democracy no longer has one  universally accepted definition, and so it is hard to say when a country ceases to be one. Consider the variety of forms in Peru, Russia, India, Zimbabwe, the United States, Austria and Japan. There is also a growing understanding that elections don't guarantee free expression or fair treatment of minorities.</p>
        <p>Yet a nation's ability to call itself a democracy often buys it sympathy among voters in the West and  among human-rights advocates everywhere. Elected leaders on almost every continent have, indeed, long used the forms of democracy as political wool to pull over the eyes of those abroad who would judge their legitimacy to rule.</p>
        <p>Throughout Latin America, constitutions are routinely amended or rewritten to expand the terms and power of presidents.</p>
        <p>In Zimbabwe, where parliamentary elections are now less than three weeks away, President Robert Mugabe has systematically attacked the opposition under the guise of a violent campaign to seize land from white farmers.</p>
        <p>In Iran, lame-duck conservatives  tried to block the newly elected reformist parliament; it was seated only with the suffrance of the Islamic republic's ''supreme religious leader,'' who can veto such earthly procedures as elections.</p>
        <p>In Singapore, and now Malaysia, elected Asian governments dominated by intolerant leaders have fashioned the most sophisticated, perfectly legal methods of destroying political opponents through the courts. The slow-moving prosecution on sex charges of Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's once-fast-rising deputy prime minister, is a prime example.</p>
        <p>As for the component parts of the former Soviet Union, tidy definitions of democracy are surely confounded by the criminalization of the economy and, to some extent, political life, not to mention the tenacity of Communist-era and Communist-style political bosses who see elections pretty much as nuisances.</p>
        <p>THERE have always been imperfect democracies; the very messiness of the political form invites imperfection. The United States has had segregation, internment of Japanese-Americans and repeated episodes of local police brutality. Europeans differ on the limits of free expression and how to treat minorities. But those can be seen as shortcomings in realizing democracy's ideals, not a negation of them. A more fundamental problem arises when institutions are too weak to provide eventual remedies for such flaws -- a role often played by elected legislatures and, in America, the courts.</p>
        <p>Arguably, a democracy strays into rogue territory when a country cannot muster any checks on the power plays of an elected leader who chooses not to step aside and rewrites the rules accordingly. A corollary is almost always oppression of some kind, often beginning with the political opposition. And the mix becomes lethal, as it did in Yugoslavia, if race, ethnicity or religion are then used to inflame political passions.</p>
        <p>Lorne W. Craner, president of the International Republican Institute, which is supported by the Republican Party, said that in some dodgy democracies, ''a lot of people have figured out you can have a bad election and get away with it.'' So his organization and its opposite number in Washington, the National Democratic Institute, have been thinking for years that it might be better to concentrate more on what happens between elections. European democracy groups and the Organization of African Unity are making a similar shift, he said.</p>
        <p>''It's very frustrating when there's no other reason why countries that have poor human rights and democracy records don't get sanctioned,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Susan Kaufman Purcell, president of the Americas Society in New York, classifies the governments of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela and Mr. Fujimori in Peru as ''imperfect democracies'' -- adding that often ''it is a hard call where to draw the line between imperfect democracies and fake democracies.'' A democracy, she says, ''at the very least must have some basic defining characteristics, the most important being the ability to vote an incumbent out of power through the use of a functioning electoral process that allows competition.''</p>
        <p>Bengt Save-Soderbergh, who runs a new intergovernmental organization in Stockholm called the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, says even free and fair elections don't define democracy: ''Deep down it's a culture, with values and also respect, tolerance -- all these things.''</p>
        <p>At Emory University in Atlanta, Robert Pastor, an expert on Latin America who served in the Carter administration and who has advised and monitored elections as far afield as China, draws a line at downgrading the essential role of national elections. There are those who say, for example, that building in voting experience from the village up, as China and Pakistan say they are doing (and as Americans did before 1789), may be more useful than imposing periodic national elections on an inexperienced people.</p>
        <p>''There's been an argument that says democracy is more than elections,'' Mr. Pastor said. ''I agree with that, but not when one takes the next step and says that elections are not that important for democracy. On that I completely disagree. Democracy should be more than free elections, but it can't be less.''</p>
        <p>And then there is the problem of a different kind of rogue: The democracy whose human rights record or foreign policies fall short of international standards but don't raise eyebrows. The contrast between attitudes in America toward India and Pakistan is instructive, one that human rights organizations often point to.</p>
        <p>The State Department's annual international human rights survey is very critical of India for its treatment of women, minorities and people declared ''untouchable'' by the Hindu majority. In the disputed territory of Kashmir, which is under Indian military occupation, the report found significant abuses of the local Muslim population. Moreover, American officials say that India has only narrowly escaped being placed on the list of terrorist nations for its backing of unrest in neighboring nations, including bombings and perhaps  assassinations in Pakistan.</p>
        <p>But at Human Rights Watch in New York, Kenneth Roth, the executive director, said that Americans often overlook the record because most of India's governments have been freely elected, while neighboring Pakistan gets much closer scrutiny, having lurched in and out of military rule. ''India has many attributes of a democracy,'' said Mr. Roth. ''But it's too facile to embrace India as a democracy without recognizing the flawed nature of its political system when it comes to marginal populations or perceived security threats.''</p>
        <p>Ram Narayan Kumar, an Indian human rights leader, worries about the precedent. ''Around India,'' he said, ''the lesson other countries there will learn is that you just have to appear to be democratic.''</p>
        <p>E XAMPLES matter everywhere, said John L. Hirsch, a former American ambassador to Sierra Leone who is vice president of the International Peace Academy, a research organization with close ties to the United Nations. In Africa, he said, the two countries in which to hope for continued success  are Nigeria and South Africa, both of which held open elections last year.</p>
        <p>Michael Joseph Smith, a political science professor at the University of Virginia, said that strong democracies ''haven't given enough thought to maintenance and sustaining of democracy.'' In the case of Peru, he added, the United States could have given stronger support to the Organization of American States. Instead, the Clinton administration first endorsed, then backed away from, an unusually bold O.A.S. judgment that the election was flawed. Professor Smith and Mr. Craner said that was a bad message to send to Latin America.</p>
        <p>''We need to mobilize the multilateral organizations to a far greater extent,'' Mr. Smith said. ''Democracy needs constant attention.''</p>
