        <p>ANN HAMPTON CALLAWAY stood on East 30th Street on a September day 21 years ago, surrounded by suitcases and boxes. Just in from Chicago at 21, she had come to New York with two dreams: to become a jazz singer and to star in a Broadway show. Within three days, she had a job as a singer in a piano bar.</p>
        <p>Her second goal took a little longer -- 20 years, to be exact.</p>
        <p>''When I was getting started I was interested in acting, but a 5-foot-10 woman with a strong personality is not the ingenue type,'' she said. ''So when I read, they said, 'Come back in 10 years.' Then when I came back in 10 years, they said, 'You don't have any credits.' ''</p>
        <p>Finally last December, at 41, Ms. Callaway, who lives in Croton-on-Hudson, opened as the lead in ''Swing!'' The revue features old swing favorites like ''It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)'' and ''In the Mood,'' as well as songs written for the show, including one by Ms. Callaway. She also wrote new lyrics and vocal arrangements for some of the show's old songs like ''All of Me'' and ''Stompin' at the Savoy.''</p>
        <p>As much as Ms. Callaway had yearned for her moment on Broadway, she now finds that the process of developing the show has whet her appetite to write for the theater.</p>
        <p>Her colleagues in the show appreciate her behind-the-scenes contributions. The show's director and choreographer, Lynne Taylor-Corbett, praised Ms. Callaway's generosity of spirit, and her co-star, Laura Benanti, wrote in her Playbill biography, ''How I long to be, one day, like Ms. Ann Hampton Callaway.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Callaway and Ms. Benanti have both been nominated for a Tony for best performance by a featured  actress in a musical. The show itself was nominated for best musical, and Ms. Taylor-Corbett was nominated for best director and best choreographer. Also, nominated for a Tony for orchestration for the show was Harold Wheeler.</p>
        <p>Ms. Callaway learned about jazz at an early age. Her mother is a voice coach and professional singer, and her father, who gave her her first rhyming dictionary, also taught her to scat sing when she was a child.</p>
        <p>Even so, she views the 20 years she spent singing in cabarets and concerts as her real education. That education began three nights after she arrived in New York, Ms. Callaway recalled. Her sister, Liz, who also planned to pursue a singing career, joined her, and they went to a piano bar for a drink. While they were there, a customer requested ''Sometimes When We Touch,'' and the singer didn't know it. ''I can sing it,'' Ms. Callaway said.</p>
        <p>The pianist demurred that he couldn't play it. ''I can play it,'' Ms. Callaway told him. That number earned her a standing ovation from the audience and a job offer from the bar's owner.</p>
        <p>''I only knew about 25 songs at that point, but I practiced in my room,'' she recalled. ''I didn't have a piano so I practiced fingering on my bed so I would have enough songs to sing and play for six hours a night. And since many of the residents were alcoholics, I could practice singing without disturbing them.''</p>
        <p>While Ann Callaway was singing in cabarets, Liz Callaway found theater work almost immediately, starring in her first musical by the age of 19. ''She had a phenomenal voice and was a true ingenue, but it was hard for me sometimes,'' Ann Callaway said. ''However, I was fortunate to be a one-woman show and create evenings of songs. I learned my craft and who I was and developed a body of music that was perfect for me. Now I walk down the streets of New York and see ghosts. I must have worked at about 200 nightclubs, and I know more than 500 songs.''</p>
        <p>Life as a cabaret singer was an awakening. ''People were doing poppers at the piano at my first job,'' she recalled. ''And lines of cocaine. And trying to go to bed with me. They were my sociology education. When I lived at the Rutledge I'd have to use a phone booth on the street, and men would come up and ask me how much I charged. But I had fun. I could party with the best of them. Life was a banquet, and I wanted to partake.''</p>
        <p>But she settled down. She became involved in an eight-year relationship that ended only recently. She performed at Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center. She wrote and performed the theme for Fran Drescher's television show ''The Nanny.''</p>
        <p>Barbra Streisand recorded some of her songs, including one she had asked Ms. Callaway to write. She made seven recordings of her own. She even moved to the suburbs with her cat. After renting in Dobbs Ferry for four years, she bought a house in Croton-on-Hudson where she can look at the woods through her picture windows.</p>
        <p>She has learned to drive and loves the commute -- she uses the time to warm up her voice, listen to jazz, chant or practice yoga breathing.</p>
        <p>The only thing she cannot practice in the car is dancing, which for Ms. Callaway is the show's most daunting challenge. ''Swing!'' is a show about dancing, and although she had taken dancing lessons as a child, Ms. Callaway had not been very good.</p>
        <p>Now she dances, too. In preparation for her role, she went back to dancing school and lost 40 pounds.</p>
        <p>''I gave up alcohol, meat and caffeine,'' she said. ''I beat myself into shape. I wanted to look the best I could possibly look when I was finally able to fulfill that dream. Besides, I was sharing the stage with a bunch of 20-year-olds.''</p>
        <p>With eight shows a week, keeping the weight off is not a problem, and Ms. Callaway has enough energy left over to think about her next projects.</p>
        <p>''I would love to be in a musical with a book. And a film. And my sister and I are hoping to do something with 'Sibling Revelry,' a show we wrote together.''</p>
        <p>And always, more songs.</p>
