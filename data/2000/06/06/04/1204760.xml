        <p>Many analysts say utilities stocks are bargains; sector has steadily, if slowly, shed its sensitivity to changes in interest rates; most electric utilities no longer need to borrow huge amounts to build new generating capacity, and many companies as so awash in cash that they have become lenders and investors themselves; analysts attribute turnaround in part to fact that utilities are one of few sectors that pay rich dividends, resulting in yields that are high even by historical standards; despite rally in sector this year, dividend yields for new investors in many utilities are as high as 7 percent, quadruple the 1.51 percent yield for Dow Jones industrial average; graph, photo (M)</p>

        <p>NOTORIOUSLY vulnerable to rising interest rates, utility stocks fell 23.5 percent last year, their worst performance in a quarter-century, as the Federal Reserve made credit more expensive on three occasions, starting June 30.</p>
        <p>So what has happened this year as the Fed raised rates another three times? The stocks have not only rallied but have performed better than any other group. The Standard &amp; Poor's utility index has returned 20.6 percent through Friday while the S.&amp; P. 500 has fetched just 1.1 percent.</p>
        <p>What's to explain this turnaround? Several things, industry analysts and portfolio managers say, not least the fact that utilities are among the few sectors that pay handsome dividends, resulting in yields that are high even by historical standards.</p>
        <p>Despite this year's rally, dividend yields for new investors in many utilities are flirting with 7 percent -- quadruple the 1.51 percent yield for the Dow industrials.</p>
        <p>''Dividend income is one of the few real things you get from a company,'' observed William H. Reaves, president of a Jersey City money management company that specializes in utilities.</p>
        <p>Unfashionable as such thinking has become in a technology-dominated investment world, it is clearly attracting some investors partial to equities but weary of the gyrations that have become commonplace on the Nasdaq and, all too often, for high-priced blue chip stocks as well.</p>
        <p>''They're jumping into utilities,'' said Edward J. Tirello, who analyzes the group for Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. The appeal is not just high yields, he added, but that utility stocks are highly liquid and the companies in many cases offer prospects for growth in a newly deregulated environment.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the industry is steadily, though slowly, shedding its traditional reputation as supersensitive to changes in interest rates. No longer do most utilities need to borrow huge amounts to build new generating capacity. Many of the companies are raking in so much cash that they have become lenders and investors themselves.</p>
        <p>And many analysts say that after years of underperforming, utilities are bargains.</p>
        <p>THE values are pretty compelling right now,'' said Daniele Seitz, director of equity research at UBS Warburg. She cited ''hidden value'' that deregulation is unlocking for many companies, such as from energy-trading and telecommunications, and the relatively friendly attitude that state officials have taken in awarding compensation for so-called stranded costs for plants that are no longer competitively viable.</p>
        <p>With federal encouragement, half the states have facilitated some form of free market in electricity and natural gas, with consumers getting a choice of suppliers. This kind of deregulation is changing the risk-reward profile of the industry.</p>
        <p>Although strategies differ, the industry is gravitating roughly into three camps -- those oriented toward generating power (such as Edison International, -- based in Rosemead, Calif.), those that distribute it (GPU of Morristown, N.J.) and those that follow the traditional route, doing both (Southern of Atlanta, Ga.).</p>
        <p>Generation is considered riskier but distribution remains subject to price regulation, and analysts say it is too early to know the winning strategy.</p>
        <p>''We don't know which plan's going to work out better,'' Mr. Tirello said.</p>
        <p>Still, the companies do stand to benefit from strong growth in demand for power, which many believe will result in shortages in some parts of the country this summer. And there is little risk that fresh capacity will put downward pressure on rates anytime soon since independent ''merchant'' plants have become difficult to finance, analysts said.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, utility dividends, after a decade in which many companies cut payouts in response to Wall Street pressure to transform themselves into vehicles for rapid growth, seem relatively secure again.</p>
        <p>Asked about favorite stocks, Ms. Seitz cited American Electric Power, -- a Columbus, Ohio, holding company yielding 6.93 percent with an energy-trading operation, good fuel diversification and the scale to be a major supplier. She also likes New Orleans-based Entergy -- (4.09 percent), the company that has the industry buzzing about its aggressive embrace of deregulation, and Duke Energy -- of Charlotte, N.C. (3.81 percent).</p>
        <p>Mr. Tirello favors Atmos Energy, -- a Dallas-based gas distributor (6.12 percent); American Water Works, -- ''a natural monopoly'' in Voorhees, N.J., (3.63 percent); and such electrics as the Dallas-based TXU (7.07 percent) and New Jersey's Public Service Enterprise Group -- (5.90 percent).</p>
        <p>AS FOR Mr. Reaves, who has been following the industry for some 50 years, the high-yield standout is the St. Louis-based Ameren, -- paying 7.04 percent and increasing its earnings 6 percent a year. He also likes Virginia's Dominion Resources -- (5.73 percent) and, for the patiently venturesome, the growth-oriented Peco Energy -- in Pennsylvania (2.30 percent).</p>
        <p>''The stocks tend to do better when there's caution in the market'' generally, Mr. Reaves said. But he said many investors were still inhibited by old notions about these suppliers of basic household services.</p>
        <p>That is likely to change.</p>
