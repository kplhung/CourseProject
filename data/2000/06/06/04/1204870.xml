        <p>The Yankees and the Boston Red Sox appear to be in a race that will very likely not turn out to be a race at all. How can there be a race when no one loses?</p>
        <p>Certainly much can happen in the remaining two-thirds of the season, but from the vantage point of the first weekend of June and the first interleague series of the season, the Yankees and the Red Sox have the look of playoff teams. The only question would be which will go as the division champion and which as the wild card. Therein, some people believe, lies the problem.</p>
        <p>''I'm pretty old school,'' John Valentin, the Red Sox third baseman, said before sustaining a season-ending knee injury last Tuesday. ''I'd rather fight them in a pennant race and be the winner and have no wild card. Then these games would mean a lot more. They really would. Right now these could be pennant-type ballgames. They're exciting now, but they're not going all out. The atmosphere is different.''</p>
        <p>He was referring to the collection of 10 games the Yankees and the Red Sox have in a four-week span (why they are playing all of those games this early in the season is another issue). The games are less meaningful, Valentin suggested, because no matter who prevails in them, no matter who winds up in first place at the end of the season, the other team expects to be right there, too.</p>
        <p>But Mike Stanley, his teammate, disagreed about the value of the wild card. ''I wasn't a fan of the wild card until the first year, '95, when we won it,'' Stanley said, referring to the Yankees, the team he played for then. ''I came back with the Yankees in '97 and we were the wild-card team. In '98 and '99, I was with this team and we were the wild-card team. So every year except '96 I've been on the wild-card team, so I'm a big fan of it now.''</p>
        <p>''Your ultimate goal is to get into the playoffs,'' the wild-card king added. ''You're just looking for a spot to go in.''</p>
        <p>Commissioner Bud Selig acknowledged that the existence of the wild card could dilute the excitement of a division championship race but only if the loser of that race is guaranteed the wild-card spot. And, he noted, baseball offers no guarantees.</p>
        <p>''I'm not sure that the one that doesn't win is guaranteed the wild card,'' he said, referring to the Yankees and the Red Sox. ''You have an interesting Chicago-Cleveland scenario, and Toronto isn't far behind the Yankees and Red Sox. There could be quite a race for the wild card as well as for the division championship.''</p>
        <p>Gene Orza, the No. 2 man at the players association, said wild-card races were more likely to produce excitement than division races. ''The wild card has the potential that division races do not,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The number of teams in a division race, Orza added, is limited by the number of teams in the division. A wild-card race can include any number of teams from all of the divisions.</p>
        <p>The National League wild-card team has been decided the past two seasons by playoff games. The Chicago Cubs defeated the San Francisco Giants in 1998, and the Mets knocked off the Cincinnati Reds last season.</p>
        <p>''Everything has its pluses and minuses,'' Selig said, ''but I think the pluses with the wild card outweigh the minuses.''</p>
        <p>The irony of the schedule is that if the Yankees and the Red Sox were playing at least half of their games in the second half of the season, as they have been accustomed to doing, the dilution of their race for first place could be even greater because they would be in a better position to know their chances of reaching the playoffs as the wild card.</p>
        <p>No one has a specific explanation for why the teams play 10 of their 13 games before the end of June and why the Red Sox play in New York twice in three weeks, the second time before the teams play in Boston for the first time. Perhaps more interestingly, according to a person with knowledge of the schedule-making, neither team raised the chronology as undesirable.</p>
        <p>This is the first time since the American League went to a balanced schedule with expansion in 1977 that the Yankees and the Red Sox were scheduled to play the majority of their games in such a short period. In 1978, they had 7 games in 16 days in June and early July, but they played 8 other games that season, including 6 in a memorable September.</p>
        <p>Katy Feeney, a major league schedule expert, was not involved in planning the A.L.'s 2000 schedule, but she said interleague play had affected schedules generally. Special team requests and travel patterns also influence the schedule, she said.</p>
        <p>Bonds's Home Run Pace</p>
        <p>In a spring training conversation about the increase in the number of players who have hit 50 home runs in recent seasons, Barry Bonds of San Francisco was asked if he thought he could hit 50.</p>
        <p>''I never hit 50 so I'll never say I can hit 50,'' said Bonds, whose career high is 46. ''If I had done it before, I'd say yes, but I've never hit 50. I'm not going to.''</p>
        <p>Bonds slugged his 21st and 22nd home runs against Tim Hudson of Oakland yesterday, leapfrogging  Mark McGwire for the major league lead. His home run ratio would project to 68 for the season.</p>
        <p>When Marquis Grissom of Milwaukee hit a home run last Monday, he relinquished his lead in the race among players who do not know the baseballs are supposed to be livelier this season. Grissom produced his first home run of the season on his 197th time at bat.</p>
        <p>The new leader is Miguel Cairo of Tampa Bay. He had hit no home runs in 177 at-bats. He was followed by Homer Bush of Toronto at 150 and Mickey Morandini of Philadelphia at 146.</p>
        <p>Darrin Fletcher of Toronto hit three grand slams in his first 944 major league games, a career that spanned nine years of major league service. But in his first 41 games this season he matched that total, slugging grand slams against Kent Mercker of Anaheim on April 20, Jason Johnson of Baltimore on May 8 and Doug Brocail of Detroit on May 26. Fletcher leads the majors this season with three grand slams.</p>
        <p>Stephenson Unbeatable</p>
        <p>Kent Bottenfield struggled through five seasons with five different teams and compiled an 18-27 record. Then last season he won 18 games and lost 7 for St. Louis. The Cardinals traded him to Anaheim for Jim Edmonds in March because they felt Garrett Stephenson was ready to start for them. Stephenson had pitched in four seasons with four different teams, emerging with a 14-12 record. He had an 8-0 record before he lost to Cleveland, 4-2, last night.</p>
        <p>Steve Trachsel, who last night incurred his sixth defeat in Tampa Bay's 1-0 loss to the Mets, has one complete-game shutout and seven innings in each of two other shutouts for his only victories of the season. In his other 10 starts, he has allowed 42 earned runs in 50 2/3 innings for a 7.46 earned run average.</p>
        <p>In a five-day span, the Chicago White Sox suffered their first loss in James Baldwin's eight starts, the Arizona Diamondbacks their first in Brian Anderson's eight and the Mets their first in Al Leiter's nine starts.</p>
        <p>Alignment Plans</p>
        <p>Officials plod on trying to devise an alignment and a schedule format for next season. The prevailing plan would have 16 teams in the National League and 14 in the American, with Arizona and Tampa Bay switching leagues. The players association, however, has submitted an idea for two leagues of 15 teams each, with Houston moving to the A.L.</p>
        <p>The advantage of the 15-15 alignment would be that the leagues and their avenues to the playoffs would be symmetrical -- three divisions of five teams each with three division champions and a wild card for the playoffs. Under the 16-14 setup, the N.L. would have four division winners and no wild card and the A.L. would have two four-team divisions and one six-team division.</p>
        <p>Officials don't like 15-15 because it would require seasonlong interleague play. The officials prefer interleague games in two clusters, as they are scheduled now. But the union has devised a format for an unbalanced schedule, which is the No. 1 goal of Commissioner Bud Selig.</p>
        <p>The union format provides for 72 games against division opponents (18 each), 72 games against the other 10 teams (seven or eight each) and 18 interleague games (three each against five same-division teams and three against a geographical rival or otherwise selected opponent).</p>
        <p>Other than having seasonlong interleague games, the alignment has two problems:</p>
        <p>*The Texas Rangers have wanted out of the A.L. West to play more games in their own time zone for television purposes, but lucrative new 10-year television and cable contracts (worth a combined $550 million for them and the hockey Dallas Stars) have apparently rendered that problem moot. Furthermore, the Astros would join the Rangers in the A.L. West, creating a Texas-sized rivalry.</p>
        <p>*The Astros' owner, Drayton McLane, has said he does not want to change leagues, and he can veto a move. He would have to be convinced it would be in the best interests of baseball for the Astros to relocate.</p>
        <p>''The response from the players has been overwhelming,'' Gene Orza, the union's associate general counsel, said. ''They're very enthusiastic about it. They like the absolute balance. They like the idea of everybody playing the same kind of schedule, having the same number of teams and having the same ways of getting to the playoffs.''</p>
        <p>The players have to approve any change in the leagues' alignment.</p>
