        <p>Leonard H. Roberts,  chief executive of RadioShack, misses no chance to show that his company wants to make technology more friendly -- especially to women, who remain a clear minority among his customers. On Wednesday, Maria Bartiromo interviewed him for her CNBC show at her office off the New York Stock Exchange floor. Mr. Roberts was in town to herald the change of his company's name from the Tandy Corporation (and its new stock symbol, RSH instead of TAN).</p>
        <p>Afterward, he noticed her struggles to fix a totally unresponsive computer. ''This is bad,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''I'm from RadioShack,'' Mr. Roberts bravely offered. ''I can help you out.''</p>
        <p>He turned the machine around and they saw that the keyboard had become unplugged. Ms. Bartiromo crawled under the desk and handed the cable back up to him. Even then, Mr. Roberts had to reset the machine and press several more buttons and keys. ''He was great,'' Ms. Bartiromo says, while Mr. Roberts admits that for all his confidence, ''It was a high-risk program.''</p>
