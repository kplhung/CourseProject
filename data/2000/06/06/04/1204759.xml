        <p>Brooklyn may be enjoying a boom period, but Brooklyn Bridge has fallen down.</p>
        <p>Last week, days before the magazine of that name was scheduled to win an award for its coverage of the city's most populous borough, it abruptly suspended publication.</p>
        <p>''I don't know if they'll give it to us once they hear we're suspending,'' Melissa Ennen, the founder and publisher, said wistfully of the City and Regional Magazine Association award. Ms. Ennen said that lately the magazine, which cut publication last year from monthly to once every two months, had been breaking even. But on May 26, as the staff was assembling its next issue, the advertising director left, rendering the skeleton staff even more skeletal.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ennen, who felt there was too little time to hire a new art director, then faced a tough decision. As she sorted through a desk full of paperwork in the magazine's office on Atlantic Avenue in Boerum Hill, she explained one reason she chose to cease publication. ''I have M.S. and it's getting worse,'' she said. ''I need to find someone to take it over so I can take care of my health.''</p>
        <p>The only glossy publication devoted to Brooklyn, the magazine had a paid circulation of 38,000. Ms. Ennen, who had no journalism experience, started it in 1995 and invested $5.3 million of her own money.</p>
        <p>Martin S. Walker, chairman of Walker Communications, a magazine consulting firm, said Brooklyn Bridge lasted longer than he had expected. ''The problem with Brooklyn is that it's many different communities,'' he said. ''It would be almost impossible to edit a publication for one Brooklyn.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Ennen said another problem with Brooklyn was that large advertisers tend to look toward Manhattan to place their city ads.</p>
        <p>Former employees said that the magazine's editorial quality was high but that it had organizational problems, including high turnover. Ms. Ennen acknowledged the high  turnover, but said that is to be expected with a start-up. ''People come in, everyone has an opinion of what the magazine should be,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ennen said that she has not yet determined how much it would cost to revive the magazine, but that to be profitable it would probably have to be a monthly.</p>
