        <p>FROM birth to death, the clothes found in the attic of the Osborn Retirement Community here span life's milestones.</p>
        <p>There is a tiny, 150-year-old ecru lace christening dress and a black taffeta mourning ensemble dating from the 1890's. There is a creamy satin bridal gown, circa 1853, with a full skirt, veiled bonnet and two bodices: one with short sleeves for the ceremony, one with more modest long sleeves for afternoon tea.</p>
        <p>And there are dozens of Chinese-style silk robes, fashionable in the 1920's, not representative of any particular event but poignantly apropos: the Osborn is a retirement home where elaborate lounge wear might well get more exposure than street clothes.</p>
        <p>Through the end of this month the 1853 wedding gown and one from the 1870's, along with dozens of old jet, brass, mother of pearl and ceramic buttons, will be on display in the lobby of the Osborn's main building off Theal Road. (The public can call 925-8308 for an appointment.)</p>
        <p>Previously on exhibit were a 1920's flapper dress encrusted with bugle beads, and a victorian velvet tea gown, and, before that, other aged but restored pieces of clothing.</p>
        <p>''Treasures in the Attic,'' as the restoration project is called, is continuing. Louise Lowry, 78, who lives in an apartment building on the Osborn grounds, and Helen O'Connor, 87, whose suite of rooms is in the main building, make up the restoration committee, along with Rosemary Duerr, a younger woman who does not live there but who is a manager of Manufacturers and Traders Bank, which has a branch on the site.</p>
        <p>For three years, the three women have volunteered four to five hours a week, sorting, cleaning and repairing the wardrobes left behind by those no longer living. In some ways, it is a sad reminder that objects endure while people do not, but, say those involved, it is also tremendously rewarding.</p>
        <p>''These are beautiful clothes that residents left behind when they died,'' Mrs. Lowry said. ''Maybe their children didn't want to take them -- they were too busy or their own homes were too crowded. Maybe there was no one to take them. It's like finding a closet full of wonderful things but on a much bigger scale.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. O'Connor added, ''We feel the need to share them, to show others what we're doing to restore them.''</p>
        <p>The Osborn began in 1908 with a bequest from Miriam Osborn. Although it looks like a turn-of-the-century summer resort, it is home to 175 people who live independently; 50 in assisted-living quarters and 84 in skilled nursing. On its 56 acres, it also has an apartment building and individual houses.</p>
        <p>The clothes were discovered three years ago in the upper stories of the main building, when they were about to be converted to office space. The volunteer committee began sifting through them, discarding those that were beyond repair, then moving the remaining pieces to more accessible quarters. There are hundreds of articles, including shoulder-padded coats from the 1940's, fluid-looking black silk dresses from the 1930's, brocade robes from the 1920's and lace and satin pieces from earlier years.</p>
        <p>There are also novelties: costumes from Halloween festivities and little plays the residents produced for one another.</p>
        <p>After sorting through the clothes, Mrs. Lowry, Mrs. O'Connor and Mrs. Duerr consulted professional fabric restorers on how best to clean them. ''The proper way is to use very mild soap and cold water,'' Mrs. O'Connor said. Mrs. Lowry added, ''Hold up the garment, let gravity draw the dirt down and pat dry with a towel.''</p>
        <p>Then it was time to categorize the clothing. Mrs. Lowry, who studied costume design at the University of Cincinnati, had books to consult to determine their origins.</p>
        <p>In some cases, there was even more to go on. One of the wedding dresses was dated 1853 in a note left by a resident, Marjorie Wrigley, who wrote that it had belonged to her mother. It is made of cream-colored satin in several pieces: a bell-shaped skirt, a short-sheeved bodice for the actual wedding and a top with long sleeves, to be worn for other occasions, and a bonnet with a veil.  The two tops, Mrs. Lowry said, are typical of the time in which they were made: ''In those days, they were more willing to show their bosom than their arms.''</p>
        <p>The other bridal gown, Mrs. Lowry ascertained, dates from the 1870's. It is faille, a popular silk of the period, and has a characteristic bustle and draped skirt. The bodice is tight and extends over the hips, to accentuate the fashionable tiny waist.</p>
        <p>The mourning ensemble is probably from the 1890's, Mrs. Lowry said. It belonged to the family of John W. Sterling, the lawyer who helped Miriam Osborn establish the home. It was most likely worn by his mother upon the death of her husband. The skirt is smooth; the jacket, tight fitting. Although it is trimmed with knotted taffeta ball fringe, the overall look is more tailored than that of the earlier fashions.</p>
        <p>Asked if working on the clothes triggered wistful memories of their own lives, Mrs. Lowry and Mrs. O'Connor said yes and no.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Lowry, a widow, was married in 1944, in a dove gray dress, which she eventually decided she no longer liked. Although she gave it away, she said that she likes to hang onto most things. Mrs. O'Connor, also a widow, described herself as being anti-sentimental. She said she was married in 1941, a year when an elaborate dress would have been considered ostentatious. She wore a pale blue velvet street-length dress, which she no longer has.</p>
        <p>''I threw everything out,'' she said. ''I had a wonderful husband, a wonderful life, but I've never wanted to cling to the past.''</p>
