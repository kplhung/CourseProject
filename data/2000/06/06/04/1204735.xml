        <p>Re your May 26, 27 and June 1 news articles about the suspension of performances by the Martha Graham Dance Company because of financial problems:</p>
        <p>As a country, America shamefully undervalues its great dance artists and neglects an art form, modern dance, that is one of its outstanding contributions to world culture. Two years ago, many of us in the dance community were astonished to discover that the board of directors of the Martha Graham Dance Company was forced to sell the building in which Martha Graham had crafted her masterworks, evolved her technique for training the body and produced generations of dancers.</p>

        <p>Re your May 26, 27 and June 1 news articles about the suspension of performances by the Martha Graham Dance Company because of financial problems:</p>
        <p>As a country, America shamefully undervalues its great dance artists and neglects an art form, modern dance, that is one of its outstanding contributions to world culture. Two years ago, many of us in the dance community were astonished to discover that the board of directors of the Martha Graham Dance Company was forced to sell the building in which Martha Graham had crafted her masterworks, evolved her technique for training the body and produced generations of dancers.</p>
        <p>Now, the company has shut its doors indefinitely. Our city, state and federal government should be providing capital support. What we lose now can never be reclaimed, particularly in the ephemeral world of dance.</p>
