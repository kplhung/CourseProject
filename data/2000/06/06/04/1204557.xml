      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The labels are familiar -- white wooden latticework partly obscured by a grapevine -- but the letterhead is new: ''Castello di Borghese,'' and, subordinated under it, ''Hargrave Vineyard.''</p>
        <p>Marco Borghese, who, backed by investors, bought the property from Alex and Louisa Hargrave, is also creating a Web site, www /castellodiborghese.com.</p>
        <p>The letter accompanied the first releases under his ownership, although the three 1998 wines -- a blanc fume (a sauvignon blanc, whose name reverses the familiar fume blanc), a cabernet franc and a pinot blanc -- come from grapes grown and processed by the Hargraves.</p>
        <p>Mr. Borghese is putting his own stamp on the property, on Route 48 in Cutchogue on the North Fork, and his vision, decisions and sense of style will begin to be measured with this year's vintage, his first.</p>
        <p>''We plan to plant different varieties of Italian grapes which are available from California,'' he said. ''We are most serious about sangiovese, and will experiment with nebbiolo and dolcetto. Three years after planting, I'll bring someone from Italy to help make the wine they produce.''</p>
        <p>The winery's former formal dining room will become the entrance. The current tasting room will become an office, and the former entrance hall will become a large tasting room. The former barrel room adjacent to the old entrance is being used for entertainment.</p>
        <p>The extended transition involves disposing of the acquired stock, which will also include the Hargraves' 99's. The Borghese name will appear on the label for the first time with this year's vintage.</p>
        <p>The blanc fume ($11) comes close to its predecessors in quality and interest. It's a stern but agreeable mouth-filling summer wine with more than usual herbal or grassy overtones, suitable for seafood prepared with dill and tarragon, as Mr. Borghese wrote in his letter.</p>
        <p>Juicy, simple, almost quaffable, the cabernet franc ($15) is suitable for a number of meat dishes.</p>
        <p>The pinot blanc ($10) is too sharp, reflecting perhaps too early harvesting before the grapes reached full physiological maturity.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Borghese, the biggest test begins this autumn.</p>
