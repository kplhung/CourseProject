        <p>JUST as the ospreys and swans begin their spring ritual of building nests, young rowers from neighboring high schools have appeared on the chilly waters of Oyster Bay for the last three years, dipping their oars in unison and sending their long narrow boats quietly racing across the waves.</p>

        <p>JUST as the ospreys and swans begin their spring ritual of building nests, young rowers from neighboring high schools have appeared on the chilly waters of Oyster Bay for the last three years, dipping their oars in unison and sending their long narrow boats quietly racing across the waves.</p>
        <p>The fledgling racing program has grown to include hundreds of students who practice almost daily throughout the spring season and then test their skills in weekend regattas here and on tranquil waters in such faraway places as Philadelphia, Saratoga and West Point.</p>
        <p>The program is viewed by those who travel along West Shore Road as the first visible sign of success in plans by the state and the Town of Oyster Bay to redevelop the former Jakobson shipyard and the western waterfront into a center for marine science, education and recreation.</p>
        <p>But the graceful, fragile racing shells and the hopes of many student rowers, some of whom dream of turning their sporting effort into college scholarships, may soon disappear because of a dispute between those who manage the rowing teams and state and town officials who say they do not have enough room in their plan to accommodate the growing number of rowers and their equipment.</p>
        <p>The racing shells, long oars and other gear are stored now in a Quonset hut that was built three years ago as temporary storage by the Sagamore Rowing Association, a nonprofit group that provides equipment, racing advice and expertise.</p>
        <p>Town and state officials recently advised the association and the high school teams that the Quonset hut would have to be torn down by the end of June to make way for development of a freshwater wetland area fed by Mill Pond. The rowers have been offered the use of a nearby warehouse, but the building is half the size of the Quonset hut and is already more than half filled with boats from a sailing school. In effect, they say, they are being squeezed out.</p>
        <p>''We've been sent a letter by the town to vacate the building and take it down,'' said Spencer Ross, commodore of the Sagamore Rowing Association. ''We've been offered another building, but unfortunately it's only a fraction of the size of the current one and is already occupied.</p>
        <p>''Secondly, the building that they've offered presents a safety hazard. There is a road in front of it, making it unsafe for the young rowers to carry the boats across.'' The road, West End Avenue, is used mostly for access to a parking lot.</p>
        <p>The largest boats, which require eight rowers and a coxswain, are more than 60 feet long and weigh 250 pounds. ''That's a lot for a team of young high school girls to handle,'' Mr. Ross said. ''On or off the water, safety has to be the main concern.''</p>
        <p>He said that the ideal spot for the rowers would be a corner of the old Jakobson shipyard where ''there would be no road to cross and we could go right into the water.''</p>
        <p>The 5.2-acre shipyard is key to reclaiming the waterfront. It sits at the heart of the southern end of the bay and is bordered by beaches and public parkland. Much of the bay, which is home to the Pine Island oyster and still produces 90 percent of the oysters harvested in the state, has been designated a National Wildlife Refuge.</p>
        <p>The current plans for the half-mile-long location include, among other features, a 15,000-square-foot marine education facility, restrooms, overlooks and increased vegetation for a nature walk, dock space for tall ships at what was Jakobson's pier and piers for smaller vessels.</p>
        <p>Plans also call for a 2,500-square-foot building with water access for the town's Bay Constable and the Fire Department's dive and rescue operations. Three buildings were retained to house government agencies, the Oyster Bay Sailing School, offices of the Sagamore Rowing Association and a museum.</p>
        <p>Officials estimate the entire project could take five years and cost more than $12 million, of which more than $4 million has been raised, according to State Senator Carl L. Marcellino, who has been leading the state effort to redevelop the bay.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ross said he remained hopeful that some compromise could be worked out. ''We're anxious not to have a confrontation because they have been nice enough to permit us to be here in the first place,'' he said. ''We really think we have something much desired, and if we had more space, we could accommodate a lot more high schools and not exclude anyone.''</p>
        <p>The student rowers are caught in the middle, fearing that something they have grown to love is in imminent danger of being lost.</p>
        <p>''Although I'm graduating this year, I'll be back to row on the bay this summer and years to come,'' said Jason Moskowitz, 18, a senior at Friends Academy who says he was recruited by every major Ivy League school that has a crewing team. He chose Columbia.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moskowitz said that the western waterfront was the best area on the bay for rowing because other areas have too much boat traffic, especially in the summer. ''It's too dangerous there,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''I hope they find a way to keep the boathouse at the new development area,'' he said. ''The sport has done so much for me, and I wish much the same for others, so I hope the Town of Oyster Bay finds some way to keep us there.''</p>
        <p>The schools that now train and compete in Oyster Bay include Oyster Bay High School, which has rowers from Locust Valley High School who are planning to form their own team, Friends Academy, Chaminade High School and Our Lady of Mercy Academy. Three high schools are on the waiting list: Syosset, Plainview and Jericho.</p>
        <p>There are 10 regional high schools that have teams: the four rowing here, plus Bay Shore, Cold Spring Harbor, Huntington, St. Anthony's, Half Hollow Hills and, in Queens, Beech Channel. There are 43 high school teams across the state, and 138 across the country.</p>
        <p>Judy James, an assistant coach from Friends Academy, said she feared that the loss or curtailment of boating facilities ''could be the end of high school rowing in Nassau County.''</p>
        <p>''The students have worked hard to clean up the bay,'' she said. ''Now they are being squeezed out, and the students want to know why.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. James said 300 to 400 rowers took part in a regatta on the bay in early May, with an equal number of supporters lining the water's edge cheering them on. ''We wanted everyone from the town to feel welcome,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Michael Deering, a former president of Friends of Oyster Bay who now serves as the group's consultant on the waterfront project, said the plan had been praised by Governor George E. Pataki as a model of the way local residents could work with state and local officials. He said he remained optimistic that the rowers and the state and town could work out their differences.</p>
        <p>''We've completed the acquisition stage and heard what the public has to say about what they want,'' Mr. Deering said. ''We're now attempting to transfer those needs and wants into real working plans.''</p>
        <p>He said attempts would be made to accommodate the Sagamore Rowing Association in its search for a significant expansion. ''But while expansion may be a good idea and may be something we will want to pursue, it's something that will require additional study,'' he said. ''It has not yet been determined how many boats may be appropriate for the area.''</p>
        <p>Senator Marcellino said the rowing association might have to move outside the project area to grow, ''possibly to one of the Town of Oyster Bay beaches in Bayville.''</p>
        <p>But that beach, the Centre Island Town Park, at the northern end of Oyster Bay where a brief stretch of sand and roadway separate the bay from Long Island Sound, is a poor location, especially for high school beginners, according to Deborah Colton, a spokeswoman for the rowing association. ''The winds and the currents are tricky and the undertow can be dangerous in that part of the bay,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Marcellino worked with Governor Pataki and the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, to secure $5 million in state funds toward the $6 million purchase of the Jakobson shipyard in 1997. The Town of Oyster Bay provided the other $1 million.</p>
