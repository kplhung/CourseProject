        <p>ON a spring Saturday night, a crowd reeking of grunge and glamour choked the entrance to Gavin Brown's Enterprise, a gallery in the meatpacking district. It had come to see Fischerspooner, nine performance artists costumed like a hybrid of the 1980's band Devo and the cast of ''The Rocky Horror Picture Show.'' The artists sang and danced with the audience against a backdrop of smoke, strobe lights and synthesized music. Reservations for the five nights of performances were a must, but many wheedled their way past the list-keepers.</p>
        <p>''It's mad,'' said Cecily Brown, the painter. ''No one wants to be the one who hasn't seen it. Of course, it has to do with Gavin. He has a consistently high batting average of art that is new and lively.''</p>
        <p>Gavin is Gavin Brown, a British-born dealer, who represents a roster of rising stars, the best known of whom is Chris Ofili, whose creativity with elephant dung was the subject of the fuss over the Brooklyn Museum's ''Sensation'' show last year.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Brown is more than an art dealer. He is also the proprietor of Passerby, a bar adjacent to his gallery, which is a cliquish rendezvous for art and fashion, atracting the likes of Moby, the D.J.; Chloe Sevigny, the actress; Terry Richardson, the fashion photographer; and Jeffrey Kalinsky, the store owner.</p>
        <p>Right next door, Mr. Brown's wife, Lucy Barnes, runs a clothing boutique, selling her own designs: slip dresses, A-line skirts and halters with antique lace and crystal beads. She has a following among well-heeled artists like Rachel Feinstein, who married the painter John Currin in a Lucy Barnes gown inspired by Marie Antoinette as a shepherdess. Her bridesmaids wore Barnes dresses inspired by ''The Stepford Wives.''</p>
        <p>Art gallery, bar and clothing boutique -- all are part of a nexus of cool on West 15th Street between Ninth and 10th Avenues. The scene, as one dealer put it, is ''superhip, groovy artists, great parties, a fashion-meets-the-art-world kind of thing.''</p>
        <p>That sort of comment makes Mr. Brown cringe. He insists that he and his Scottish-born wife never set out to create a scene, that it is mere happenstance that their three businesses are cheek by jowl on a block slightly off the beaten path, making it a kind of demimonde destination.</p>
        <p>Unlike the polished galleries of Chelsea, Mr. Brown's space, with a concrete floor and only 900 square feet for exhibitions, is a gritty showcase for emerging artists. And Mr. Brown, 37, who favors jeans, work boots and an unshaven look, is not like his slick, Prada-suited colleagues on West 22nd Street. He cultivates an anticommercial image and a prickly persona. He once faxed friends, asking them to nominate him for most obnoxious gallery attendant for an art magazine. (He didn't win. An employee of Mary Boone's did.)</p>
        <p>''I love Gavin, but he's a rogue,'' said Richard Flood, the chief curator of the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. ''I value him for his rudeness and his creativity within the marketplace. Running a gallery has always seemed like an annoyance rather than a privilege to him.''</p>
        <p>Susan Hort, a New York collector, said it took a long time before Mr. Brown was enthusiastic about selling art to her. To prove her support, she bought a broad range of his artists, rather than just those who were hot. ''A collector who wants to collect with him gets around the difficult part or deals with him,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Why bother? With new and old galleries thriving, why buy paintings from someone who acts like the Soup Nazi of the art world?</p>
        <p>''What raises Gavin above his degage attitude is the fact that he's got some of the hottest artists of the moment,'' said Bruce Wolmer, the editor of Art and Auction magazine. ''In addition, he's got a kind of cool magnetism that makes the gallery work. He's the anti-earnest art dealer. He mirrors the moment. He's not ironic. He's beyond irony. He's beyond caring. That's what's cool.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown did not care to be involved in this article. He declined requests for an interview, then met briefly with this reporter. His comments were mostly etched in acid. Asked why he chose West 15th Street, rather than a spot among other high-profile Chelsea galleries, he said, ''It's nearer to the subways than the other ones.'' Asked about the anticommerical bent of his and his wife's businesses -- she sometimes doesn't let her friends pay for clothes, and he made no profit from the 30 Fischerspooner performances -- he replied, ''We're saints.''</p>
        <p>Raised in suburban London, Mr. Brown attended a graduate-level art program at the Whitney Museum of American Art before opening his first gallery in 1994 on Broome Street. The space, which he constructed himself, was minuscule, but it quickly became a place where artists, dealers and curators gathered to argue aesthetics over beers.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Brown moved to 436 West 15th Street in 1997 -- opening with no sign, only an orange brick facade to mark the spot -- it was logical that he would also import a bar. Passerby, a bare-bones establishment, is only some benches and stools, with a disco floor that lights up in response to music -- actually a work of art by Piotr Uklanski.</p>
        <p>''When I was a kid, artists hung out at Spring Street Bar,'' said Ivy Shapiro, a daughter of Joel Shapiro, the sculptor. She is with the Barbara Gladstone Gallery. ''Until Gavin's bar came around, there wasn't a good place for artists to hang out.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Barnes, 34, is unlike her cantankerous husband. Friendly, easygoing and soft-spoken, she sometimes pads around her small, light-filled storefront in flip-flops. The shop contains cream-color sofas, a birch tree adorned with vintage silk flowers and a couple of racks of Ms. Barnes's simple but quirky clothes.</p>
        <p>Because she uses vintage textiles or makes her own printed fabrics, adding hand finishes like beaded trim or appliques, her designs, which range from $50 to $1,500, are often one of a kind. They are sought by artists who want to wear something more unusual than the latest dress splashed across magazine ads.</p>
        <p>''You can wear Lucy's clothes head to toe and not look like you're dipped in a designer,'' said Jessica Craig-Martin, a photographer whose work appears in Vogue. ''You can get really dressed up, and there's something still funky about them.''</p>
        <p>In the fall, Barneys New York will begin to carry Ms. Barnes's collection. ''Her clothes are more artisanship than design,'' said Julie Gilhart, the vice president for fashion merchandising at Barneys. ''Everything in fashion is big and grand, and we have all those designers doing major influential collections. It's so refreshing to trip over someone doing something small and unique. It's like finding a little restaurant that offers great service and great food.''</p>
        <p>The aura of selectivity that surrounds Ms. Barnes's clothes, as well as her husband's gallery, serves both well. Jack Bankowsky, the editor of Artforum, said that Mr. Brown's detachment and interesting artists explain his attraction.</p>
        <p>Unlike their dealer's off-putting attitude, Mr. Brown's artists tend to show work that is engaging and accessible. Elizabeth Peyton paints lush portraits of pop stars like Kurt Cobain. (A Peyton work was auctioned last month at Christie's for $70,500, more than double the house's highest estimate.) Even the conceptual art that Mr. Brown shows, like Rikrit Tiravanija's work -- in which the artist offers food to people and displays the leftovers -- has benevolent, even populist implications.</p>
        <p>''There are two kinds of dealers,'' said Mr. Flood, the Walker Art Center curator. ''One is the kind that harvests when the crop is mature. The other tends to the seedlings. That's Gavin. He's not an opportunist. He's identified the talent and maintained it. In last fall's Chris Ofili show, every painting but one -- that is, four out of five -- sold to a major museum. That's a dealer who is really doing his job.''</p>
