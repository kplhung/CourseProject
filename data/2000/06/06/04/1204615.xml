        <p>ALFREDO SILIPIGNI pored over the books in his ample library. Unsatisfied, he consulted with music historians. Finally, enlisting the help of the author Susan Vandiver, he sent an e-mail message to Italy. Just days before rehearsals were to begin for the New Jersey State Opera's production of ''Tosca,'' one simple fact plagued Mr. Silipigni: the color of choir robes in Rome in 1800, the setting and time of Puccini's opera.</p>
        <p>''This is the kind of thing that goes on always, and that many people don't notice,'' Mr. Silipigni lamented. ''People completely misunderstand your efforts at authenticity.''</p>
        <p>Those painstaking attempts to recreate the original performances are what define Mr. Silipigni, artistic director and principal conductor for the New Jersey State Opera.</p>
        <p>Born in Atlantic City to Florentine immigrants, Mr. Silipigni is a fixture in the state's arts scene and an increasing rarity: an old-school conductor. Educated at Westminster Choir College in Princeton and at Juilliard, he trained under Alberto Erede at the Metropolitan Opera. He has conducted Beverly Sills, Birgit Nilsson, Giuseppe Taddei, Magda Olivera and Placido Domingo.</p>
        <p>In March, the president of the Republic of Italy bestowed upon Mr. Silipigni the rank of Cavaliere, the Order of Merit, for ''greatly contributing in presenting a positive image of Italy in the U.S.,'' said Giorgio Radicati, Consul General of Italy in New York.</p>
        <p>''The New Jersey State Opera is still trying to preserve a niche, specializing in Italian and French standard repertoire from 1880 through 1930,'' said Mr. Silipigni, one of the few conductors delivering verismo performances. ''There have been a great deal of adjustments. I've had to adjust in order to restore.''</p>
        <p>Those changes include set designs, from canvas to carpentry; the evolution of musical talent, like loss of style to better technique; and the whims of fashion, dictating the body types of his divas, Mr. Silipigni said.</p>
        <p>Conductors have also had to learn new rules. ''When I started out, the conductors would scream so that I would go to the bathroom and throw up, then return to work,'' said Mr. Silipigni, whose career has spanned four decades. ''All of this has changed. Musicians have rights now. New conductors now have to worry about being politically correct.''</p>
        <p>Rehearsal time has been cut. ''Toscanini had 36 rehearsals with his orchestra,'' he said. ''I get three. Today, rehearsals are so expensive, you can't afford to talk much.''</p>
        <p>Louis D'Amico, the orchestra personnel manager for the State Opera, said that though the orchestra was technically freelance, he assembled 90 percent of the same players for each performance. ''These are professional musicians from New York's Metropolitan Opera, City Opera and Broadway,'' said Mr. D'Amico, who began his 30-year career with Mr. Silipigni as a timpanist. ''Even if they are on the road, they will find a substitute to come and play with Alfredo. They do that because they enjoy working under his baton. It's the things that he does with the orchestra that you don't find in the books. It comes from years and years of experience.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Silipigni is also leaving his mark on the opera world by training conductors. Currently, Li Jian, a concert pianist and teacher at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, is his latest baton protege. ''He knows every little detail in the full score without even looking at it,'' Mr. Li said. ''Just imagine that you are standing in front of a 100-piece orchestra, a dozen high-profile singers and an 80-piece chorus, trying to convince them of your ideas without physically singing or playing any of the instruments. It is very difficult. He demands a lot, but he does it in the most efficient and polite way.''</p>
        <p>Though the life of a conductor oozes with glamour -- and Mr. Silipigni looks the part with ascot, pencil-thin mustache and manicured fingernails -- it is constant work. When not rehearsing, he is preparing for the next production, hammering out phrases on his Steinway and delving into his library. ''I have a compulsion to create music,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Before each production, Mr. Silipigni conducts ''Operalogues,'' lectures on specific operas and their composers sprinkled with performances of the significant arias and little-known historical facts.</p>
        <p>His wife, Gloria, also plays a critical role in the company. Much like the wife of a politician, she must continually entertain her husband's talent and patrons.</p>
        <p>''We wouldn't have had this opera for 35 years if it weren't for Gloria's entertaining,'' Mr. Silipigni said. ''After one of her meals and a glass of champagne, we can iron out any problem. She's a lot more popular than I am. But, then again, I don't like people; I like music.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Silipigni's goal when he began his career was to create great music, he said. ''Now, that just seems grand and pompous,'' he said. ''I conduct for myself. If it is not what consumes me, then it doesn't work for me.''</p>
        <p>After ''Tosca,'' Mr. Silipigni will travel to China to serve as guest conductor for the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra in July.</p>
