        <p>The town of Cortlandt does not have to pay $15 million in damages for rezoning the site of a mine, an appeals court has ruled. Briarcliff Associates of Briarcliff Manor had bought the mine in 1985 and had hoped to expand it into a gravel mine. After the town rezoned the site to prevent its further use in 1988, Briarcliff Associates filed suit, claiming that the rezoning resulted in an unconstitutional taking of property. The State Supreme Court ruled in Briarcliff's favor and set damages at $15 million. The Appellate Division, however, overruled that decision. But Briarcliff plans to appeal to the State Court of Appeals, said Stuart R. Shamberg, a lawyer for Briarcliff Associates.</p>
