        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a longtime parishioner of St. Paul's Roman Catholic Church in Princeton, I was pleasantly surprised to see the large photograph of the interior of our church, and a very large article that it accompanied (''The Second Great Wave,'' front page, May 28), which I felt would  describe our parish, school, organizations and so on. Yet none of us  Caucasian members were mentioned, and neither was the Pastor, Monsignor Walter F. Nolan or the Parochial Vicar Father Michael Santangelo, or the Korean division within our church, with their own priest, Father Simon H. Ahn. To people outside of Princeton you are giving an entirely false picture of the largest Catholic church in this area.</p>
