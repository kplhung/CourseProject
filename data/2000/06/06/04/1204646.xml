        <p>The Riverhead Central School District is considering changes in rules for chaperons on school trips after the suicide of a student arrested on a drug charge at a New Jersey amusement park in April.</p>
        <p>The school superintendent, Robert J. Holmes, said last week that the new procedures would require that a teacher serving as chaperon remain behind to assure the safe return home of any student arrested on a school trip.</p>
        <p>But some teachers were said to be concerned about the requirement.</p>
        <p>The dead student, Robert D. Pace, 18, a senior and a member of the National Honor Society, was left behind when the schools' buses left Great Adventure in Jackson, N.J., after an associate high school principal, Joseph Ogeka, told chaperons and the police in Jackson that Mr. Pace would not be allowed to rejoin his classmates.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pace was released in his own custody, and his body was found by the Long Island Rail Road tracks east of Bethpage the next morning. Authorities said he had jumped between the cars of a moving train.</p>
        <p>His parents have asked to address the school board when it meets on June 13. Dr. Holmes said he did not expect the board would adopt the proposed policy changes until a later meeting.</p>
