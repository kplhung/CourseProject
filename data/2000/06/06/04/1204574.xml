        <p>FORGET the lone bugler. Instead picture 650 trumpet players gathered in one place, then imagine about half of them trying out new instruments, practicing scales or rehearsing. The result -- a  joyous noise, a distinctive clamor, a common language spoken by a tribe that perfectly understood one another's blasts and toots.</p>
        <p>The sounds floated through the Purchase College campus recently, when the International Trumpet Guild met for its 25th anniversary conference.  Trumpet players from Finland, Ukraine, France and Germany joined some of the best players in America for four days of networking, music making and merchandising. The recital schedule suggested how much could be done with one horn. The eclectic performers included the Carnegie Hall Jazz Band, the Lyon Conservatoire Trumpet Ensemble and the Salvation Army New York Staff Band.  The trumpet section of the New York Philharmonic also played, as did Wynton Marsalis.</p>

        <p>The sounds floated through the Purchase College campus recently, when the International Trumpet Guild met for its 25th anniversary conference.

        <p>A steady stream of shoppers browsed through stacks of sheet music, books and CD's and fingered the assorted instruments and accessories for sale. These included a 9 1/2-inch pocket trumpet, modeled after instruments used in the French cavalry, as well as everyday items like slide grease and valve oil. A student competition took the form of a mock orchestral audition, while panels considered subjects ranging from jazz improvisation to custom-designed mouthpieces.</p>
        <p>One discussion resembled a fireside chat, as panel members recounted the early days of brass chamber music.  Robert Nagel, founder of the New York Brass Quintet, described the group's first recording session in the 1950's.  ''We played in a cold garage, wearing overcoats and fingerless gloves,'' he said. The audience in the PepsiCo Theater listened raptly. There was not a toot to be heard.</p>
