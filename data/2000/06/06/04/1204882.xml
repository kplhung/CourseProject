        <p>Tim Hardaway is probable, Grant Hill and Tim Duncan are questionable, and Allen Iverson is extremely doubtful.</p>
        <p>As injuries pile up for the United States Olympic men's basketball team, the alternate list keeps growing. While Hardaway's injured foot is expected to heal in time for the Sydney Games, which begin Sept. 15, Hill and Duncan are question marks after recent surgeries.</p>
        <p>''They've all indicated that they want to play,'' Craig Miller, the director of USA Basketball, said. ''It's all about their recovery time now.''</p>
        <p>Hardaway, who was passed over for the previous teams, does not want to miss an opportunity to compete in the Olympics. But if Hill is out, Kobe Bryant is the favorite to be selected.</p>
        <p>Duncan, who is recovering from knee surgery, is also a question mark. Antonio McDyess, Eddie Jones or Shareef Abdur-Rahim would most likely take the spot. But the committee has not ruled out approaching Shaquille O'Neal, who originally turned down the request to play.</p>
        <p>Two USA Basketball officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Iverson was a long shot to make the team because of the team's depth at guard. Alternate decisions will not be made until mid-June, Miller said.</p>
        <p>But the team will not be hurting for talent although its presence will not rival the pageantry surrounding the original Dream Team in 1992. The 2000 team will open preliminary play on Sept. 17 against China, then play Italy on Sept. 19, Lithuania on Sept. 21, New Zealand on Sept. 23 and France on Sept. 25.</p>
        <p>Besides the injured players, Ray Allen, Vin Baker, Vince Carter, Kevin Garnett, Allan Houston, Jason Kidd, Alonzo Mourning, Gary Payton and Steve Smith will represent the United States.  Marion Jones is more of an underdog.</p>
        <p>The Falk Influence</p>
        <p>Rod Thorn's joining the Nets as president and chief of basketball operations not only gives the organization a bona fide presence in the front office, but it also squelched the notion that the agent David Falk was somehow running the team through the connection with his clients.</p>
        <p>Falk, who represents Stephon Marbury, Keith Van Horn and Kerry Kittles, also has a close friendship and business relationship with John Thompson, whom the Nets interviewed for the position. Falk has often been accused of leveraging the contract extensions of Van Horn and Kittles against delivering Marbury to the Meadowlands from Minnesota. Falk was deeply involved in the blockbuster trade, but had no say in other personnel matters.</p>
        <p>It is almost a break for Thompson that he did not get the job. His personal association with one of the game's most powerful agents would have unfairly distorted the perception of his job performance.</p>
        <p>Much the same way league officials had baselessly accused Falk of pulling Patrick Ewing's strings during the lockout, Thompson may have suffered from the same fallout.</p>
        <p>McGrady May Be Moving</p>
        <p>All Arn Tellem, the agent for Tracy McGrady, will say is, ''We're keeping all our options open.'' But it is looking more and more as though McGrady, the skywalking Toronto Raptors forward, will not be helping Vince Carter much longer.</p>
        <p>McGrady, the pick of the free-agent litter with Tim Duncan, Grant Hill and Eddie Jones, is leaning toward signing with Orlando or Chicago -- the teams with the most salary-cap money stockpiled. According to a person familiar with McGrady's plans, McGrady's decision may come down to what other prominent free agents the Magic or the Bulls sign before McGrady commits.</p>
        <p>If Glen Grunwald, Toronto's general manager, feels he is going to lose McGrady to another team for nothing, the possibility of a sign-and-trade deal grows exponentially.</p>
        <p>Either way, the long-held notion that McGrady would not leave the Raptors because of his close relationship with Carter is fading fast -- almost as fast as the notion that McGrady enjoys playing for Coach Butch Carter to remain in Toronto. On several occasions last season, he saw Butch do what was best for Butch and Vince do what was best for Vince. By leaving Toronto, McGrady is about to do what is best for McGrady.</p>
        <p>His tale is tied to a larger one to be played out this summer.</p>
        <p>If McGrady, Hill, Duncan and Jones command the maximum-allowable salary for a player of their experience levels, the money left for those second-tier free agents whose current teams decide not to re-sign them will be minimal.</p>
        <p>Deemed one of the major setbacks to players in the new collective-bargaining agreement, free agents like Glen Rice, Toni Kukoc, Ron Mercer, Jalen Rose and Rashard Lewis can only hope their teams want to retain their services and pay fair-market value. If they do not, they may end up playing for $2 million exceptions for teams that do not have the money to compensate them.</p>
        <p>The list goes on. Avery Johnson. Antonio Daniels. Kurt Thomas. Kendall Gill. Tim Thomas. Tim Hardaway. Players like those and Maurice Taylor, Cuttino Mobley and Tariq Abdul-Wahad may have to scramble to find a salary commensurate with their skill levels after all the big money is paid out.</p>
        <p>Great system, no? The elite players are about to get richer as a plethora of former and potential All-Stars may have to work for Joe Kleine-type wages. It will be the price extracted for cutting down on widespread player movement.</p>
        <p>Around the League</p>
        <p>The Nets are already talking about moving their No. 1 pick in the draft, according to a Western Conference general manager who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The Nets are not enthralled with any of the most likely top four picks -- Chris Mihm, Kenyon Martin, Stromile Swift and Marcus Fizer -- and have considered swaps with both Orlando, which has the fifth, 10th and 13th selections, and Chicago, which has the fourth, seventh and 24th picks. Vancouver has also been talking with Orlando about shipping its No. 2 pick to the Magic for a compilation of Orlando's picks, according to an Eastern Conference team official.</p>
        <p>The Clippers are interested in John Lucas and Del Harris regarding their vacant coaching job and have not completely ruled out that a current assistant, Dennis Johnson, will take over. Double standard? Scottie Pippen's elbow to the back of John Salley's head in Game 4 of the Western Conference finals did not do much damage to Salley and cost Pippen only a $10,000 fine. But anyone viewing the tape could see that Pippen's elbow was thrown with almost the same malicious intent as the elbow J. R. Reid threw to A. C. Green's mouth during a 1996 regular-season game between the Knicks and the Suns, knocking out a few of Green's teeth. Reid was suspended.</p>
        <p>Playoff television ratings are improving but are still far below Michael Jordan's swan song in 1998, from which the league does not expect to recover any time soon. With a Pacers-Blazers final still a possibility, network and league officials had been portrayed as doing everything to conspire that the Knicks and the Lakers were in the finals next week. Those big-market theories began to get under the skin of the N.B.A. ''There's nothing you can do about it,'' said the deputy commissioner, Russ Granik. ''People are going to believe what they want to. But for some reason, I find myself this year being a little more upset about it than usual. They're basically accusing you of being dishonest and you just have to sit there and take it.''</p>
