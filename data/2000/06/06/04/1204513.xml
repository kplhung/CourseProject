        <p>'A parley at the summit'' was what Winston Churchill called for a half-century ago. He envisioned an intimate get-together of a few world leaders and not a paperbound conference ''zealously contested by hordes of experts and officials drawn up in a vast cumbrous array.''</p>
        <p>This week's scheduled summit in Moscow between Vladimir Putin and Bill Clinton would not be to Churchill's taste; hordes drawn up in a vast cumbrous array (what a mouth-filling derogation of staff) will be whispering in summiteers' ears.</p>
        <p>Whoops! In referring to what is universally being called the upcoming (that is, forthcoming) summit, I have transgressed. ''As a noun,'' reads the ordinarily sensible New York Times Manual of Style and Usage, ''summit may designate the level or format of a meeting (the issue will go to the summit) but is jargon when used as a synonym for meeting (they held a summit).''</p>
        <p>As they say in the Pentagon, I nonconcur. (That's jargon.) The stylist's resistance to linguistic change is laudable -- new terms should have to fight their way into general acceptance over time -- but players in the poker game that is language have to know when to hold 'em and when to fold 'em. Summit is no longer merely an attributive noun modifying meeting or conference; usage over 50 years has turned the modifier into that top-level conclave itself. Cancel the meeting.</p>
        <p>With that settled (at least in my mind), we can turn to this week's summit in Moscow and diplomacy's fierce struggle of verbs about a controversial arms control treaty: abrogate versus withdraw.</p>
        <p>In 1972, the general secretary of the Soviet Union's Communist Party, Leonid Brezhnev, and President Richard Nixon signed a treaty to limit antiballistic missile systems. The ABM treaty, in its Article XV, says, ''Each Party shall, in exercising its national sovereignty, have the right to withdraw from this Treaty if it decides that extraordinary events . . . have jeopardized its supreme interests.'' Six months' notice is to be given ''prior to withdrawal.''</p>
        <p>Hard-liners in the United States point to a new missile threat from rogue nations, learnedly mutter rebus sic santibus -- circumstances have changed'' -- and add that the Soviet signatory of 1972 no longer exists. Unless the Russians agree to let us build a limited missile defense against a terrorist attack (a defense not powerful enough to affect Russia's deterring missile forces), then we should withdraw from the treaty.</p>
        <p>Softer-liners counter that such unilateral action would undermine all arms control; instead, they hope Clinton in Moscow will seek minor amendments to the treaty to allow a limited U.S. defense that would not cause the Russians to worry that their missile force could be stopped. (I am being excruciatingly evenhanded here.) They warn of a worldwide reaction against us if the United States abrogates the treaty.</p>
        <p>The choice of verbs -- withdraw or abrogate -- tips the reader to the point of view. Abrogate means ''to cancel, annul, quash, void, to abolish authoritatively.'' The word is harsh; in William Tyndale's 1526 translation of the Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews, we see the controversial ''In that he sayth a new testament he hath abrogat the olde.''</p>
        <p>Withdraw, in contrast, means ''to retract, to take back or away'' or ''to remove''; in another sense, it means ''leave the room.'' Robert Henryson, in his 1480 ''Testament of Cresseid,'' came up with a gentle line still remembered fondly by copy editors afflicted with prolix writers: ''Withdraw thy sentence, and be gracious.''</p>
        <p>A New York Times editorial opined, ''Mr. Bush would withdraw loans and credits to Russia over its crackdown in Chechnya and abrogate the Antiballistic Missile Treaty.'' Though both steps would be ''dangerously confrontational'' in the newspaper's view, its use of withdraw regarding loans and abrogate about the treaty suggests that it would find the latter step more troubling.</p>
        <p>''Abrogate has a pejorative connotation,'' says Anne-Marie Slaughter, a revered professor of international law at Harvard, ''in the sense that it means 'to end the treaty not in accordance with the treaty's terms.' It suggests a much more active decision to end the treaty and is much closer to the term breach than the term withdraw.''</p>
        <p>That's what Senator Barry Goldwater had in mind when he took a case against President Jimmy Carter to the Supreme Court, claiming the president had unlawfully abrogated a treaty with Taiwan. In turning down his appeal, the Court avoided the hot verb and refused to intervene in what it called Carter's termination of the treaty.</p>
        <p>At the current Moscow summit, the word abrogate is used by the Clinton briefers only to say what they would not do and what the Republicans might do. The G.O.P. candidate, Governor Bush, last year used the harsh word to indicate what he might be prepared to do, but this year he has sidestepped the semantic trap, preferring withdraw.</p>
        <p>Which verb will triumph? Keep your eye on a dark horse coming up on the outside: amend. If Clinton gets Putin to agree to change the ABM treaty, he will declare success and send the amendments to the Senate. In response, G.O.P. leaders have already chosen a hospital term to describe their reaction to any modest amending: dead on arrival.</p>
        <p>Zemblanity</p>
        <p>Arms controllers know that the Russians have been setting off non-nuclear explosions at its nuclear test facility on the barren, frigid Arctic island of Nova Zembla, and thereby hangs a new word.</p>
        <p>An old word is serendipity, ''a happy discovery by accident.'' It was coined by Horace Walpole in 1754, based on the fairy tale of the three princes of Serendip, who ''were always making discoveries . . . of things they were not in quest of.'' The Indian Ocean island of Serendip, later known as Ceylon, is now the nation of Sri Lanka.</p>
        <p>A Times Book Review note about the novel ''Armadillo,'' by William Boyd, reads, ''The novel's hero . . . is undone by an outbreak of zemblanity, the opposite of serendipity, in the multicultural hubbub of Cool Britannia.'' Newton Scherl of Englewood, N.J., writes, ''I have tried without success to find zemblanity in any of my dictionaries.'' That's because it is not yet there.</p>
        <p>''What is the opposite of Serendip, a southern land of spice and warmth?'' asks Boyd in his novel. ''Think of another world in the far north, barren, icebound . . . Zembla. Ergo: zemblanity, the opposite of serendipity, the faculty of making unhappy, unlucky and expected discoveries by design.''</p>
        <p>Writers from Jonathan Swift and Alexander Pope to Jules Verne and Salman Rushdie have used Zembla's wastes north of Siberia as symbolic of what Charlotte Bront called ''forlorn regions of dreary space.'' Now this site of testing of non-nuclear explosives at a nuclear facility has given birth to zemblanity, the inexorable discovery of what we don't want to know.</p>
