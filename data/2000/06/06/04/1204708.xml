        <p>IN recent years, Congress has passed several laws designed to help people remain insured when they change jobs and obtain coverage for life-altering medical situations that insurers often shunned.</p>
        <p>The problem is, most people pay little attention to what their rights are in such situations until they need them, and then may be unaware of the new laws' existence.</p>
        <p>Do you know many 25-year-old single men who are deeply obsessed with the Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act of 1996? (It was designed to eliminate what came to be called drive-by births by mandating that insurers cover minimum hospital stays following childbirth.)</p>
        <p>Employers offering health insurance are required by law to keep their workers abreast of the latest changes in health care law. But they often go about it in ways that are sure to escape notice.</p>
        <p>Annual notices to employees are required for some laws, but a lot of other important information about health care rights is buried in what are called summary plan descriptions of benefits packages, mounds of legalese about as readable as the package inserts in a Tylenol box. Smaller companies often count on health maintenance organizations to inform their employees, and H.M.O.'s have been known to fall down on the job.</p>
        <p>Jim Taylor, a principal of the Teare Group, a health care and human resources consultancy, said the first problem involved in keeping employees informed is that employers often do not understand what they have to provide in writing. ''The second is that the employee may not read it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Small wonder that the Department of Labor, which has jurisdiction over many of the laws, fields 1,700 calls a week on health care questions alone. The department has begun to audit companies to make sure they are giving their workers the necessary information, especially on the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA.</p>
        <p>Among other provisions, the 1996 law expanded protections for people with serious medical conditions who change jobs, and it has helped millions of people, but millions more know nothing about it.</p>
        <p>Under the law, as long as there has not been a break in health care coverage of 63 days or more, the waiting periods commonly imposed before a new employer's health insurance plan will cover pre-existing conditions can be reduced or eliminated entirely.</p>
        <p>For instance, say you have a chronic heart problem and were treated for it under your former employer's health plan, but your new employer's plan does not cover pre-existing conditions for the first year of employment.</p>
        <p>The amount of time your condition was covered by your former employer's plan counts against that waiting period -- if it was at least a year, coverage under your new plan begins immediately. (Your former employer is required to give you a certificate proving prior coverage.) A similar provision applies to new employees' children with pre-existing conditions.</p>
        <p>Under the law, employers cannot discriminate against workers because of chronic conditions. For example, ''under HIPAA, you cannot charge an individual a higher premium just because they have diabetes,'' said Leslie Kramerich, acting assistant secretary of the Labor Department unit that oversees pensions and benefits. ''Some employers used to say, 'We will let you in, but because you have diabetes, you have to pay a 40 percent higher premium,' or they would keep you out, period.''</p>
        <p>The law also requires that employees who give birth be permitted to enroll the baby for coverage immediately, and not have to wait for the next open enrollment period.</p>
        <p>''My instinct is that people don't realize how important HIPAA is,'' said James P. McElligott Jr., a lawyer in Richmond, Va., who specializes in health care law. ''Today, as a result of HIPAA, if a child is born to a couple or adopted, that child can have cradle-to-grave health care coverage no matter what its medical condition is. That is an enormous change from the way things used to be.''</p>
        <p>IF you think your employer has failed to comply with the law, or you are leaving a job, or you want to understand the basics and the many exceptions and nuances of HIPAA and other health care laws, the Department of Labor offers an easy-to-navigate Web site, www.dol.gov/ dol/pwba, with plenty of information.  Too much, in fact: unless you are a policy wonk, I do not recommend clicking and wading through, say, ''Health Insurance Portability for Group Health Plans; Interim Rules and Proposed Rule [04/08/1997].''</p>
        <p>But documents explaining every twist and turn in health care law in exhaustive detail are there. Georgetown University also maintains a Web site for consumers with specifics about the laws and state-by-state guidelines in modern standard English: data.georgetown.edu/research/ ihcrp/hipaa/.</p>
