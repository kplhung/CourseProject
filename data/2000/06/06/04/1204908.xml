        <p>Like a missing tooth in a beautiful smile, the gap between two buildings on Clark Street is a sad reminder of a fire that devastated part of the St. George Hotel five years ago.</p>
        <p>But the dentist may finally be on his way. Last month the Landmarks Preservation Commission approved a plan to build a 220-room, 11-story hotel on the vacant lot. The new construction would include the renovation of an adjacent building that was severely damaged in the fire. Also part of the St. George, it would be incorporated into the new hotel, which will be designed with marble baths and Internet connections.</p>
        <p>''They're now actively moving ahead,'' said Frank Angelino, a lawyer for the owners, Moshe and Shalom Drizin. ''There's a lot of interest in a quality hotel'' in Brooklyn Heights, he said, adding that contractors' bids for the project are due in the next few weeks.</p>
        <p>A multibuilding complex built between 1885 and 1929, the St. George was once the city's largest hotel and one of its finest. In recent decades it deteriorated, and was at one point a single-room-occupancy hotel for the destitute. Today, parts are used for student housing, while four buildings have been converted to co-ops.</p>
        <p>To preserve the character of what became the city's first historic district, the building will match the neo-Renaissance style of its neighbors, with a brick-and-limestone facade, copper-green metal cornices and bronze-finished display windows.</p>
        <p>But Timothy Doyle, a neighbor of the hotel, said of the owners, ''I'm not sure if they have a track record with running a quality hotel.''</p>
        <p>Pointing at a dilapidated entryway that he said once had ornate bronze details, Mr. Doyle added, ''They seem to have allowed this section to be systematically pilfered.''</p>
        <p>Judy Stanton, executive director of the Brooklyn Heights Association, said she hoped the new hotel would be run by outsiders. Although student housing is an improvement over the S.R.O., she said, ''The blight that was the operating hotel was enormous,'' adding, ''Under this owner it has not been a well-run operation.''</p>
        <p>She also said the complex has building violations outstanding. The city said there were 13.</p>
        <p>Mr. Angelino said the violations were mostly minor, and that many former violations had been corrected. He also said his clients were committed to a ''quality hotel operation,'' adding that they were undecided about who would run the hotel and had asked local groups for ideas.</p>
        <p>As to missing bronze details, he said, ''Some of it was vandalized and some of it was taken off by the owners in order to protect it and to match the dies for the architects.''</p>
        <p>The city has required the details to be retained, he said, so ''it's not in their interest to let it get stripped away.''</p>
