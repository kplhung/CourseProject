        <p>A year after buying three floors -- two of them below ground -- of an eight-story co-op building at 534 La Guardia Place in Greenwich Village for $1.2 million, the New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects has settled on an architect for its new home -- Andrew Berman, the winner of the chapter's design competition.</p>
        <p>Mr. Berman has had his own firm since 1994, and his designs have included renovating lofts and photo studios.</p>
        <p>''Having our own headquarters with its storefront design will give the A.I.A. and architects a more visible presence and, we hope, a greater voice in the public dialogue,'' said Wendy Evans Joseph, the president of the 3,000-member group.</p>
        <p>Building the new headquarters involves three phases. Phase one was the purchase.  Phase two involves construction of the ground floor, a $1.2 million project that is to get under way next spring, depending on the success of the fund-raising drive set to begin this summer.</p>
        <p>Phase three, which does not yet have a timetable, will include the two lower floors.</p>
        <p>Rolf Ohlhausen of Ohlhausen DuBois Architects, who was president of the New York chapter in 1998, said that the purchase price for the three floors was raised entirely from the chapter's members, but that the fund-raising campaign for phase two will include the public.</p>
        <p>He added that he too is pleased with the visibility promised by the street-level storefront. ''The New York chapter is the founding chapter, 135 years old,'' he said, ''but this will be the first time we won't be invisible.''</p>
        <p>Visibility is what Mr. Berman had in mind when he designed the building with its permanent gallery on the street level.  ''I thought the design would be a way to educate the public about the role of the architect,'' he said. ''And I tried to anticipate the various functions this facility will have to provide.''</p>
        <p>That meant taking into consideration the two lower floors, which will eventually include an auditorium, a library, lounges and space for the chapter's dozens of architecture-related events.</p>
        <p>The combined three floors total 10,800 square feet, including 4,000 square feet on the ground floor.</p>
        <p>But the 4,000 square feet is ''double our size now,'' Ms. Joseph said of the organization's current sixth-floor location at 200 Lexington Avenue, between 32nd and 33rd Streets.</p>
        <p>Organization officials sound confident they can raise the necessary funds, and are unanimous in saying that the additional space is necessary.</p>
        <p>''We need a place where architects can talk about issues that affect us,'' said Walter Hunt Jr. of Gensler &amp; Associates, who is the immediate past president of the New York chapter. ''And we don't have one.''</p>
