        <p>AL!'' Jeanine Pirro scolded her naughty husband. ''Al!''</p>
        <p>There he went again, stepping just a wee bit over the line. Defying instructions not to talk about his tax fraud trial, he was entertaining reporters with a sarcastic analysis of federal charges that he had neglected to report a wee bit over $1 million in personal income. ''Al!'' she scolded, with a smile. ''Zip it.''</p>
        <p>But on went Al, with Jeanine scolding and smiling at his side.</p>
        <p>The Pirros are well practiced as Westchester County's leading song-and-dance team. Even with the Clintons-come-lately in Chappaqua, the Pirros own the stage here. Albert J. Pirro Jr., a top real estate lawyer and Republican lobbyist, has long been the man to see in Westchester. And Jeanine F. Pirro, a judge and now district attorney, has long been the woman to avoid. He could make you. She could break you.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pirro openly promoted his wife's political career, but they worked to maintain an appearance of parallel lines of power: he had his business, she had hers. But those lines are converging in Mr. Pirro's tax fraud trial in federal court here.</p>
        <p>Jeanine Pirro is not on trial. Mr. Pirro and his brother Anthony, an accountant, are accused of charging $1.2 million of Albert Pirro's personal expenses to his various businesses and illegally deducting them as business expenses. But in the prosecutors' dramatization, Jeanine Pirro is the leading lady, and not exactly Caesar's wife.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pirro's companies allegedly paid some of Mrs. Pirro's political consultants. A private aide testified that Mrs. Pirro had her send some personal bills to Mr. Pirro's office, which paid (and allegedly deducted) them through his businesses. One of Mr. Pirro's companies owned the Mercedes-Benz his wife drove and claimed deductions for it, despite a circuitous paper trail that made it appear that she had paid for it, prosecutors say. An investigator in Mrs. Pirro's office, who moonlights as a security consultant, was hired on the side by Mr. Pirro.</p>
        <p>The prosecution says Mr. Pirro essentially deducted life as a business expense. And what a life it was -- fancy cars, a vacation home, big dinners, small planes, cigars, even a dalliance that produced a child. ''It's not a crime to have expensive tastes,'' a prosecutor, Cathy Seibel, assured the jury in opening arguments. But it makes good testimony in a dry tax case. The government casts Mrs. Pirro, Westchester's chief law enforcement officer, as procurer in chief of items her husband improperly deducted.</p>
        <p>Her name came up in testimony from a man who had made an $1,800 wrought-iron pen for the Pirros' Vietnamese potbellied pigs. A gallery employee said Mrs. Pirro had commissioned a $4,450 portrait of her children, wanted it in time for a dinner party and sent him faxes with district attorney's office cover sheets. A house painter testified that Mrs. Pirro had deducted $50 from his bill because he had gotten paint on a carpet.</p>
        <p>Judge Barrington D. Parker Jr. told the jury to ignore the spotted-carpet testimony and reminded prosecutors out of the jury's earshot, ''She's not a defendant.''</p>
        <p>But she is a prosecutor and a politician being splattered while sitting loyally in the front row of the courtroom.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pirro has been investigated before and never charged, and he could beat these charges. His premier legal team portrays him as a busy man whose finances were handled by other people, including his brother, and who willingly paid $1 million in back taxes once told of the problems.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Pirro accuses prosecutors of a ''desperate attempt'' to tie her to the case ''whenever they can.'' Mr. Pirro calls the charges ''character assassination.''</p>
        <p>He's facing jail if convicted, but Mrs. Pirro's public character is at risk. Mr. Pirro's protection of his wife's image as a hard-working, straight-arrow, telegenic politician is a theme in his case.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors say Mr. Pirro concocted the Mercedes-Benz transactions so Mrs. Pirro could ''state, if asked, that she purchased'' the car, if it became an issue in her race for district attorney.</p>
        <p>Then there was the ''Zoe Baird problem.'' Like President Clinton's first choice for attorney general, the Pirros apparently had tax problems with their household help. A political consultant (paid by one of Mr. Pirro's companies) advised Mrs. Pirro to come clean on her cable television program. The program's expenses were also paid by a Pirro company.</p>
        <p>The consultant said Mrs. Pirro had dealt successfully with her Zoe Baird problem.</p>
        <p>The Al Pirro problem is another matter.</p>
