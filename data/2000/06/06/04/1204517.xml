        <p>LOVE is a minefield, but women would rather blow up than be single,'' says the unflappable heroine of ''Love and Sex,'' Valerie Breiman's romantic comedy (opening in August) that could be the female response to ''High Fidelity.'' Kate (Famke Janssen), the movie's Don Juanita, casts an eye over the loves of her life, affectionately sending up the pretenses of men as she surveys sexual warfare in the trenches from a survivor's-eye view. She has emerged bloody but unbowed, having withstood even a traumatic childhood passion which in the film's hilarious opening flashback locates the love-hate roots of screwball comedy squarely in the playground.</p>
        <p>Two 12-year-olds are mutually smitten, but only one of them -- the girl, of course -- can admit it. To protect her beloved's reputation as an officially girl-hating male, little Kate allows Bobby to call her names and shove her in public so that his tough-guy buddies won't know he's in love.</p>
        <p>She then loses him when her own best friend rats on her and reveals the couple's trick. ''Among the many differences between man and woman when it comes to love,'' the now older and wiser Kate says ruefully, ''is women's need to tell the world every little detail.''</p>
        <p>The need to discuss love and sex from a female point of view coupled with a new freedom to do so would seem to be the launching pad of a gaggle of women-directed movies, many of them first films, that take us behind the scenes to a world barely imagined and perhaps not entirely welcomed by men. It's a world of whispers and confidences and giggles and tears, a great many gradations of sensuality, from the barely understood to the actively carnal, along a wide spectrum of appetites and longings; a portrait of sex that differs from the male variety in being both sadder and more humorous. Colette Burson's ''Coming Soon,'' a female rite-of-passage and right-to-orgasm film that opened last month, might be the ''she said'' version of the ''he said'' teen picture ''American Pie,'' or a prep school prequel to HBO's ''Sex and the City.'' A trio of seniors, best friends, discuss orgasms, boys and getting into college, trying to sort out their relative importance.</p>
        <p>In ''The Virgin Suicides,'' Sofia Coppola's recent magical adaptation of Jeffrey Eugenides's 1993 novel, the five Lisbon sisters share such an intense togetherness in their feverish, cloistered adolescence that they are like a single organism.</p>
        <p>Not only the attitudes, but the actresses in these made-by-women movies defy conventional male and Hollywood criteria for seductiveness and sex appeal. The heroines aren't always the glamour pusses of movie-star gloss or men's wishful thinking.</p>
        <p>Kirsten Dunst, as the sexually precocious 14-year-old Lux Lisbon, is lovely, but closed off and opaque in her bafflement, and the other three sisters (after the death of the youngest, Cecilia) are appropriately blurred, almost indistinguishable. Where a male director might have selected five ready-for-my-close-up babes for the roles, Sofia Coppola has managed to cast and direct them as a collective, girls whose tragedy is precisely that they never had a chance to become remarkable or individual.</p>
        <p>In ''Coming Soon'' (with a screenplay by Ms. Burson and Kate Robin), Stream, the main character, is played by the freckled and often scruffy Bonnie Root. She is less stunning than one sidekick -- Tricia Vessey, a comically depressed beauty who becomes a model -- but more straightforward than the third member of the trio, Gaby Hoffman's unhappily overweight sexpert who mingles lies and bitter truths in a defensive response to the constant and combined pressures of college entrance and orgasmic ecstasy. In her determination to find out what the fuss is all about, Stream is no shy blossom waiting to be plucked but an intrepid explorer, testing her reactions against the alleged experiences of her friends; nor does she suffer the consequences that once lay in store for good girls who strayed from the straight and narrow.</p>
        <p>Famke Janssen's Kate in ''Love and Sex,'' a writer and editor at a women's magazine, is model-tall but real-woman funny, a lay-it-on-the-line type of heroine who shows the disadvantages of being a string bean among peas and butter beans. As the little girl who conspires in her oppression on the playground, she's six inches taller than the swaggering tot boyfriend she worships, and the guys never catch up.</p>
        <p>On their first date, the artist (Jon Favreau) who becomes the love of her life says, ''You're the tallest woman I've ever known,'' then has the gall to ask her shoe size.</p>
        <p>The two connect with the spacey, goofy eroticism of a Woody Allen-Diane Keaton couple, and Ms. Janssen and some of the other odd enchantresses of recent women's movies -- Hilary Swank and Chloe Sevigny in Kimberly Peirce's ''Boys Don't Cry,'' Kate Winslet in Jane Campion's ''Holy Smoke'' -- represent a new type: attractive enough to make demands, but neither coy nor narcissistic. ''This is what I want. What do you want?'' they seem to say.</p>
        <p>French movies, which have always found sexiness and fascination in a wider range of women, have recently featured such offbeat stars as Sandrine Kiberlain and the versatile, dark-haired, pale-skinned Karin Viard, who is mesmerizing in two women's films, Solveig Anspach's ''Haut les Coeurs'' (shown at Rendez-Vous with French Cinema at Lincoln Center in March), where she plays a woman struggling with breast cancer, and Catherine Corsini's ''La Nouvelle Eve'' (at Rendez-Vous last year), in which she's a terrorista of love.</p>
        <p>The girls in ''The Virgin Suicides'' range in age from 13 to 17, roughly the equivalent of the boys across the way whose narration, in book and film, charts the girls' brief lives and mysterious deaths. Yet despite a strict upbringing in which their repressed and domineering mother (a brilliant Kathleen Turner, tight-lipped and inscrutable) has isolated them from any socializing outside of school, the girls are nevertheless, and typically, light years ahead of the stumbling, gawky guys who adore them from afar. Yet their poise and maturity are in some sense a sham, a mask or at least a veneer, intimidating to the boys, but only on their home ground where they form a united front.</p>
        <p>Their family is collapsing from within, a plant poisoned at its roots. Lux, the only one of them who does get out, speak for herself, assert her desires, gets violently punished, and her sisters along with her. In the 70's, when the story is set, a woman who is free with her favors is branded a tart. Just how different is it today? This question and its implications serve as the thematic motif of most of the teen films, whether guy or chick oriented.</p>
        <p>But where guy films hinge on a binary system as rigid as a computer, the women's films take a more nuanced approach to sex and its permutations, and the varying degrees of enthusiasm for it. They refuse to be pinned down by the coitus-or-bust philosophy, or the either-or vision of women as tarts or virgins, straight or gay, lusty or prudish. In Gil Junger's ''Ten Things I Hate About You'' (1999), one of the few male-directed teen films that allows its heroine to talk back, Julia Stiles brazenly ridicules the monomaniacal and hormonally indiscriminate male. ''Oh, yeah, let's do it in the back seat right now!'' she says, her sarcasm letting the guys know just how charming their idea of nirvana is to her.</p>
        <p>If there is a common enemy in these films, it's not the men but the cheerleader view of sex perpetrated by the women's magazines. In ''Coming Soon,'' Stream memorably lashes out at the very idea of the Cosmo girl, and at the other extreme, in ''The Virgin Suicides,'' Mrs. Lisbon has banished all such magazines from the house. As Mr. Eugenides writes, ''Mrs. Lisbon had never given the girls beauty tips, and forbade women's magazines in the house (a Cosmo survey, 'Are you multiply orgasmic?' had been the final straw).''</p>
        <p>In their relentless and mechanistic focus on sexual satisfaction, these magazines have put women on the spot, ratcheted up the pressure to experience constant and fulfilled sex lives. ''What about liking the guy?'' the girls in ''Coming Soon'' wonder.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, Ms. Burson's ''Coming Soon'' had a hard time finding a distributor, almost got an NC-17 rating (with behavior far less sexually graphic than that of ''American Pie'') and seems to have earned unusually hostile reactions not only from men in the industry but from male critics who complain of its ''amateurishness.''</p>
        <p>Hearing women talk about sex makes men nervous, like those giggling groups of girls in high school -- and high school hovers over the proceedings like a bad dream; having constructed an identity that passes as adult, confident in the world, we don't want to revisit the trauma of anxiety and rejection. It was one thing for guys in movies to tell dirty jokes in the locker room, compare notes on the sexual attributes of various girls, take bets on getting some and rate girls on a scale of 1 to 10.</p>
        <p>But they didn't bargain for the reverse, for getting rated in return. The idea of the sexually insatiable woman was a delirious fantasy that in reality posed only terror for the man who might not be able to satisfy. Hence the pathologizing of female promiscuity as nymphomania -- a term that, as Carol Groneman points out in her fascinating new book on the subject, ''Nymphomania,'' has undergone almost comical permutations according to each of the anxieties and misogynies in society's ever-changing view of acceptable female behavior.</p>
        <p>In ''The Decline of the American Empire' (1986), the Canadian director Denys Arcand's wonderfully even-handed and now-classic dark comedy of the sexes (he also wrote the screenplay), the endlessly voluble and confessional women discuss their affairs with each other, just like their husbands and lovers.</p>
        <p>When the moment comes, a woman knows just how to drive her man crazy: ''Jean, I love you; with Jacques it's nothing but sex. . . .'' Women were supposed to be the sweeter sex, the redeemers -- or, if sexual, the entrappers, responsible for man's downfall.</p>
        <p>Male anxiety over independent women often translates into a demonizing of the sexually spirited female. In ''Fatal Attraction,'' Glenn Close comes on to poor Michael Douglas like a harpy in heat, and more recently in the Danish film ''Mifune,'' in a gratuitous and surprisingly nasty scene, the hero is stunned on his wedding night by his bride's unbridled lust.</p>
        <p>There have been films over the years that give us glimpses of that once taboo subject -- young women's sexual initiation -- but the predominant view of the mating experience, especially in the hormonally driven teenage years, has been male. A notable exception was Amy Heckerling's ''Fast Times at Ridgemont High'' (1982), a funny, poignant adaption of Cameron Crowe's story about surfers and make-out artists in Southern California which showed the holy grail of sexual initiation as something more shadowed and equivocal where the girls were concerned. As in Ms. Heckerling's glorious ''Clueless'' (1995) and her forthcoming ''Loser'' (with Jason Biggs and Mena Suvari), the director exhibits a genius for getting into the heads and libidos of a whole gamut of high school types, male and female, nerds and royalty.</p>
        <p>Jeffrey Eugenides shows the same extraordinary ability to imagine life from both sides of the fence in his portrait of five girls who baffle and entrance a group of boys. Looking at them from across the street, collecting mementoes when they are gone, the guys probe, pry, spy and try to imagine the lives of human beings so close to them and yet so far, and finally realize the very limits of understanding. In a line lifted directly from book to film, ''We felt the imprisonment of being a girl, the way it made your mind active and dreamy.'' In her astonishingly subtle evocation of that bevy of sisters, Sofia Coppola (who wrote and directed) captures both the mystery and the yearning, and finally the sense of the hiddenness of all lives, of differences and similarities between male and female which make the struggle to understand both so difficult and so endlessly compelling.</p>
        <p>POSSIBLY the movie's most charming and revealing scene occurs when the boys and girls go on a group date to the prom -- the Lisbon sisters' first and only social outing. All crammed into the same car, the boys are stunned to hear the girls talking about everything from one neighbor's house improvements to another's rumored Nazism. That these creatures who existed only in pantomime, wafting lyrically and mysteriously behind glass windows, were in reality chatterboxes who had looked out just as the boys had looked in, radically alters the voyeuristic equation. The awesomely unknown, silent Female of romantic illusion suddenly and confusingly mutates into four living and breathing girls, voluble, idiosyncratic, full of opinions, human beings not so different from themselves. That is, until the sisters merge again in death, and are once again silenced, now by the deep freeze of memory: forever young, forever fair, virginity intact.</p>
