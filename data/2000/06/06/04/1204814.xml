        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Lighting Up a Lesson in China Trade'' (May 21) quotes the Communist Manifesto to argue for normalizing United States trade with China.</p>
        <p>The gist of that argument? That commodities spread political liberalization. The proof? The writer bought a musical lighter on his first trip to China.</p>
        <p>On Page 1 of the same issue of Money &amp; Business, ''Rallying Round the China Bill, Hungrily'' explains that liberalizing trade is good for big business. And big business is using its clout to influence policy.</p>
        <p>Crucially, economic benefits for United States companies come at the expense of Chinese control over their economy, just as they come at the expense of labor's control over the American economy. After all, the other side of ''free'' trade is ''unfree'' national politics: under World Trade Organization agreements, domestic labor concerns are subordinated to multinational profit.</p>
        <p>Now I understand how shopping at Wal-Mart generates company profits. I also understand how shopping there creates monopolies that put local vendors out of business. What I fail to understand is how shopping at Wal-Mart furthers political liberalization.</p>
