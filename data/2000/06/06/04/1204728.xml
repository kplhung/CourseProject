        <p>The Dada artist Marcel Duchamp caused a minor stir in 1917 when he unveiled a ready-made urinal with the tag ''R. Mutt'' scrawled on its side. A similar debate is taking place over a small statue inside the Madison Square Park dog run, near 24th Street and Fifth Avenue.</p>
        <p>Some say it is art. Others say it is a toilet for dogs.</p>
        <p>The statue of a two-foot-long Dalmatian was installed last summer during renovations to the park. The cast-concrete dog is bolted to the ground and sits next to the entrance.</p>
        <p>Some dog walkers mistook the statue for a grave marker until it was dabbed with black spots. Then someone placed a collar around its neck, confusing some dogs. But when its white coat began to yellow, befuddlement turned into squabbling.</p>
        <p>''It is covered in urine,'' said Kyle Merker, chairman of the Community Board 5 parks committee. ''Many things in the dog run are covered in urine, but this is at the height for little kids to touch. This is not only gross, but unsanitary.''</p>
        <p>But Henry J. Stern, the parks commissioner, said the figurine should be appreciated as art.</p>
        <p>The statue is a pet project of the commissioner, who has installed hundreds of examples of ''animal art'' citywide, turning some parks into virtual urban safaris. There are camels at John Jay Park, near 77th Street and York Avenue, and elephants at Baisley Pond Park, which skirts the northern edge of Kennedy International Airport.</p>
        <p>''We want to encourage art in public spaces,'' Mr. Stern said. ''The idea is to brighten our parks, especially for kids.''</p>
        <p>But the statue has found few fans outside the Parks Department. The community board passed a resolution last year calling for its removal, and the city's Art Commission has weighed in with its disapproval.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stern said he would consider moving the statue, but it was not a burning issue. ''Art pleases some and displeases others,'' he said.  ''That is the nature of art.''</p>
