        <p>Poverty is defined as the income level where everything goes for necessities: a third for food, two-thirds for housing, clothes, day care and transportation to work. At incomes below the poverty level -- 20 percent of children in the United States -- the deficit is made up by family and community bartering. So when Mary Gordon, in her May 29 Op-Ed article about conspicuous consumption,  raises the question of ''what the poor could do with the money,'' there's a  simple answer.</p>

        <p>They would buy food -- for their own children and the children of the friend or family member who fed their children when the money ran out the last time. Ms. Gordon's mother, like my Depression-era parents, would understand this phenomenon really well.</p>
