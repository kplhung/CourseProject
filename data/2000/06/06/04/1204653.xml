        <p>ICED tea season has started. Though there is a vast array of ready-to-drink bottled iced tea in all sorts of flavors, and iced tea mix galore, homemade iced tea, brewed from high-quality tea leaves, is so easy to prepare it can always be kept on hand.</p>
        <p>The rule of thumb is an ounce of tea to a quart of water, to yield strong tea. Chill it in the refrigerator, pour it over ice and sweeten it to taste with super fine sugar or with simple syrup, which dissolves readily in the tea. (Simple syrup is a bar staple made by boiling one-half cup sugar in 1 cup water, then allowing it to cool.)</p>

        <p>The rule of thumb is an ounce of tea to a quart of water, to yield strong tea. Chill it in the refrigerator, pour it over ice and sweeten it to taste with super fine sugar or with simple syrup, which dissolves readily in the tea. (Simple syrup is a bar staple made by boiling one-half cup sugar in 1 cup water, then allowing it to cool.)</p>
        <p>Beyond a tall glass of iced tea, there are many other cool summertime dishes that can involve tea. I prefer to use Lapsang Souchong, a strongly pungent tea with a smoky flavor, for the salad of smoked chicken. A good China black tea like Keemun is excellent to dilute the peanut butter for the noodle salad. And Earl Grey, flavored with bergamot, a kind of citrus, adds a special dimension to the chilled fruit soup.</p>
        <p>Smoked Chicken Salad With Black Tea Dressing  Total time: 40 minutes</p>
        <p>1 ounce dried Chinese black mushrooms  1 cup hot freshly brewed Chinese black tea, preferably Lapsang Souchong  1 tablespoon thin soy sauce  4 tablespoons toasted sesame oil  1 tablespoon Dijon mustard  3 tablespoons mayonnaise  1 pound smoked chicken breasts, skinned and sliced in slivers  1 cucumber, peeled, halved lengthwise and sliced  Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste  3 scallions, trimmed and chopped  1 tablespoon chopped cilantro leaves.</p>
        <p>1. Put mushrooms in bowl, pour tea over and allow to steep at least 20 minutes. Drain, reserving liquid, and place mushrooms on a thickness of several paper towels. Strain liquid through fine strainer or filter paper.</p>
        <p>2. Mix liquid with soy sauce, sesame oil, mustard and mayonnaise.</p>
        <p>3. Put chicken and cucumber in a bowl. Fold in dressing. Season to taste with salt and pepper and dust with scallions and cilantro.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Cold Noodles With Tea and Peanut Sauce  Total time: 20 minutes</p>
        <p>9 ounces thin Chinese egg noodles or fresh linguine</p>
        <p>1/4 cup unsalted chunky peanut butter  2 tablespoons thin soy sauce</p>
        <p>1/3 cup freshly brewed black tea, cooled  1 tablespoon rice vinegar</p>
        <p>1/2 tablespoon minced fresh ginger  2 teaspoons chili oil, or to taste  1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil  3 scallions, trimmed and finely minced  2 tablespoons chopped cilantro leaves.</p>
        <p>1. Bring pot of water to a boil, add noodles and boil about four minutes, until just tender. Drain and rinse well under cold water. Drain again.</p>
        <p>2. Mix peanut butter with soy sauce, tea and vinegar until smooth. Mix in ginger, chili oil and sesame oil.</p>
        <p>3. Transfer noodles to a bowl and fold in peanut mixture. Sprinkle with scallions and cilantro and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Tropical Fruit Soup Flavored With Tea  Total time: 40 minutes</p>
        <p>2 mangoes  1 cup brewed Earl Grey tea, chilled  1 cup fresh orange juice  2 bananas  2 kiwis  2 oranges  4 scoops orange or mango sorbet  Mint sprigs for garnish.</p>
        <p>1. Chill four soup plates.</p>
        <p>2. Peel, pit and dice the mangoes. Puree half of the diced mangoes. Mix the puree with the tea and the orange juice and the put the mixture in the refrigerator.</p>
        <p>3. Peel and slice the bananas, the kiwis and the oranges. Arrange fruit in soup plates. Refrigerate.</p>
        <p>4. Just before serving put a scoop of sorbet in center of fruit. Spoon tea mixture around, garnish with mint and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
