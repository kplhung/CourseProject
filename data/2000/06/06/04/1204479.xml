        <p>In New York, activities will include the International Naval Review by President Clinton, and the traditional Parade of Sail.

        <p>About 125 tall ships and warships from around the world will sail into New York July 4 for the centerpiece of OpSail 2000, an eight-city tour from San Juan, P.R., to Portland, Me.</p>
        <p>In New York, activities will include the International Naval Review by President Clinton, and the traditional Parade of Sail. At about 8 a.m. on July 4, the president, on the cruiser Hue City, will pass the anchored warships, including the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy, lining the harbor and the Hudson River to the George Washington Bridge. The review will be followed at 9:45 by a parade of some 300 tall ships, led by the Coast Guard bark Eagle, and historic vessels, including the new replica of the slave ship Amistad. The ships are to berth at 5 p.m.</p>
        <p>At 9 p.m., there will be fireworks in several places -- over the Hudson north of 42nd Street, between Brooklyn and Staten Island, over the East River between 42nd and 19th Streets and at the South Street Seaport, and over the Statue of Liberty. On the evening of July 4 and on July 5 to 8 from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., the public can tour the ships free in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Staten Island and Liberty State Park in New Jersey. For information, call (212) 435-2665 or go to www.opsail2000.org.</p>
        <p>More than 40 tall ships then will sail to New London, parading to their berths at 10:30 a.m. on July 12. The vessels -- including the four-masted barquentine Esmeralda from Chile and the Gazela Philadelphia, the oldest wooden square rigger in active service -- will be accompanied by numerous military vessels. They will be part of a celebration through July 15 along the revitalized waterfront, including concerts, fireworks and children's activities. Information: (860) 448-2000 and www.opsail2000ct.org.</p>
        <p>OpSail 2000 began in San Juan on May 25 and is proceeding to Miami this Wednesday to Saturday; Norfolk, Va., June 16 to 20; Baltimore and Philadelphia June 23 to 29, and Portland, Me., July 28 to 31.</p>
