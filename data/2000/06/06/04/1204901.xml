        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>I am an administrator in higher education and an Indiana University graduate. Although I believe that Knight has behaved badly (to say the least), the university president, Myles Brand, acted appropriately in this instance. Before this hearing, there had been little official disciplining of Knight. The university (like most organizations) must follow due process and offer its employees a plan for adjustment of behavior before a separation takes place.</p>
        <p>Also, those who have not lived in Indiana cannot understand how the state inhales basketball, and how Knight is venerated (remember a former president who ''fired'' Knight but had to rescind his decision because of alumni and general citizen outcry?).</p>

        <p>I recently visited Indianapolis on business and, while riding in a cab, I mentioned that perhaps Bobby Knight might find it was time to go, considering his recent record and some of the alleged incidents against players. The cabbie retorted that, as far as he was concerned, Bobby could stay at I.U. for as long as he wanted.</p>
        <p>That weekend the local paper noted that one half of state citizens polled still supported Knight, whatever his actions.</p>
