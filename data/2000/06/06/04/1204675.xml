        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a Yonkers resident with a 10708 zip code, I not only consider going to downtown Yonkers but I also work there (at the Downtown Yonkers Management Association) and volunteer there (with many of my 10708 neighbors) at two wonderful tourist sites (Art on Main Street/Yonkers and Philipse Manor Hall).</p>
        <p>I was born and raised in the Getty Square area and while no one can argue that serious deterioration has occurred over the years, one can also argue that things are starting to change for the better. The Downtown Yonkers Management Association recently sponsored a sidewalk sale in the square that drew hundreds of people. DYMA also sponsored a martial arts demonstration by Papa San and the Burning Bush Dozo. Local restaurants brought wonderful outdoor grilled foods to lots of hungry patrons, and other merchants brought out specially priced merchandise.</p>
        <p>Downtown Yonkers has many other attractions: historic St. John's Church in the Square, the Hudson River Museum, Untermyer Park and the Beczak Environmental Center, which was just given a grant to restore a section of the Hudson River marshlands.</p>
