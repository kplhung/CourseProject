        <p>In a city where you spend the day living through your eyes, the annual music festival provides compensatory evenings for the ears. It is one of the oldest such festivals -- the present is the 63rd -- and it long ago outgrew its name of Maggio Musicale (Musical May): events start in the middle of April and go on until the end of June.</p>
        <p>Performances are rather spread out over this period, and there is not too much focus. Zubin Mehta is the principal director, and he was around earlier to conduct the opening presentation of ''La Traviata'' and a couple of concerts. Other musicians appearing this year have included Maurizio Pollini and Radu Lupu.</p>

        <p>In a city where you spend the day living through your eyes, the annual music festival provides compensatory evenings for the ears. It is one of the oldest such festivals -- the present is the 63rd -- and it long ago outgrew its name of Maggio Musicale (Musical May): events start in the middle of April and go on until the end of June.</p>
        <p>Performances are rather spread out over this period, and there is not too much focus. Zubin Mehta is the principal director, and he was around earlier to conduct the opening presentation of ''La Traviata'' and a couple of concerts. Other musicians appearing this year have included Maurizio Pollini and Radu Lupu.</p>
        <p>Typically, the Maggio makes a point of contemporary music. Last month there was a program of orchestral works by Azio Corghi and a new opera by Giorgio Battistelli, who seems to come up with an opera almost every other year. This time his surprising subject was Raymond Roussel's novel ''Impressions of Africa.''</p>
        <p>In the city where opera was born, Monteverdi's ''Coronation of Poppaea'' was an appropriate choice a month back. And now the festival is presenting Tchaikovsky's ''Eugene Onegin,'' still something of a rarity in Italy.</p>
        <p>The musical preparation was in the hands of Semyon Bychkov, one of the Maggio's favorite conductors, though on Monday night the baton was taken over by Kirill Petrenko, a younger Russian beginning to make a mark in Austrian and German opera houses. He proved very capable. The Maggio Musicale's orchestra is unpolished, but Mr. Petrenko kept it smartly on track and was sensitive to his singers.</p>
        <p>Among the cast, Galina Gorchakova compensated for vocal problems -- trouble pitching high notes and a diminishment of rapture -- with a noble bearing. In the last scene, the passion of her acting seemed to bring back some of the old glory in her voice.</p>
        <p>The other principals were non-Russian and, in some cases, not too familiar with the style. Ramon Vargas, as Lensky, sang sweetly and freely in the first act but became overwrought in the second. Ferruccio Furlanetto looked appropriately grave and proud as Gremin but grossly sentimentalized his aria by singing it as if close to tears.</p>
        <p>Roberto Frontali, though, was excellent in the title role. His singing was always perfectly turned out: neatly phrased, secure, elegant. Then in the final scene, where Onegin at last loses his destructive self-possession, Mr. Frontali did not drop those qualities but, far more effectively, heightened and emphasized them. He is a fine, intelligent singer, and his Russian was convincing.</p>
        <p>The musical performance was also distinguished by Irini Karaianni as Olga and by vigorous singing from the Maggio chorus, rehearsed by Jose Luis Basso.</p>
        <p>On the visual side, the greatest impression was made by the Pushkin-period costumes, designed by Joachim Herzog and beautifully made. Christoph Sehl's sets featured wide spaces and tall birch trunks, often surrounding and sometimes invading the interior scenes. There were oddities of a similar kind, neither striking nor meaningful, in Alexander Schulin's production. Having Onegin and Olga dance in slow motion during the second-act ball, for instance, made no sense when the music was up to speed, and just looked clumsy.</p>
        <p>Next week, to end the festival, David Robertson conducts a Stravinsky concert -- the Symphony of Psalms and ''Le Sacre du Printemps'' -- out in the Piazza della Signoria.</p>
