        <p>NTT DoCoMo Inc., Japan's leading wireless communications company, dropped hints today that it might soon establish a presence in Britain, a lucrative mobile phone market that would significantly add to DoCoMo's increasingly fast-paced international expansion.</p>
        <p>Responding to press reports that DoCoMo was about to acquire a stake in Telesystem International Wireless Inc., a Canadian company that is heavily invested in the British market, a senior DoCoMo executive acknowledged that a link with Telesystem was an attractive option.</p>
        <p>The executive, Kiyoyuki Tsujimura, head of DoCoMo's global business development division, also said a link with Orange, a big British mobile phone company, was another attractive option.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tsujimura spoke after The Financial Times, Britain's leading business daily, and Jiji Press, a Japanese news agency, both reported that DoCoMo was about to spend 200 billion yen, or about $1.8 billion at current exchange rates, to buy a 15 percent stake in Telesystem.</p>
        <p>DoCoMo officials declined to confirm those reports, and the Japanese company's stock fell 1 percent, to 3.01 million yen.</p>
        <p>DoCoMo owns 19 percent of Hutchinson Telecom, an affiliate of the Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchinson Whampoa, which already has a joint venture with Telesystem to develop a network to provide next-generation mobile services in Britain. Telesystem recently spent $6.4 billion for one of five new licenses to offer those services and now must seek partners to help it make the capital investments needed to exploit the license.</p>
        <p>A Telesystem investment would fit in with DoCoMo's strategy of buying small stakes in foreign mobile phone operators to spread its ''i-mode'' service, the largest mobile Internet access service in the world. It has seven million subscribers, mostly in Japan, the only country where i-mode was available until recently.</p>
        <p>The company recently bought a 15 percent stake in KPN Communications, a Dutch wireless operator, and is rumored to be in negotiations with VoiceStream Wireless, a mobile phone company in the United States, and SK Telecom, a Korean mobile phone company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tsujimura also said DoCoMo could lease a network to avoid the acquisition of expensive infrastructure at a time when providing content and the technology to bring it to tiny phone screens is looking like a more lucrative business.</p>
        <p>DoCoMo is suddenly moving fast to establish a beachhead in Europe, home of the biggest immediate opportunities in the global mobile market, because its i-mode technology will be matched by the next generation of a technology known as wireless application protocol, or WAP, within the next year or so.</p>
        <p>So far, i-mode enjoys a distinct advantage over WAP, which uses a different technical language from the Internet and thus requires Web sites to write completely new programs to deliver their contents over WAP-enabled mobile phones.</p>
        <p>By contrast, i-mode uses the same language as the Internet, making it relatively easy for Web sites to connect to DoCoMo subscribers.</p>
        <p>''By sometime next year, the specifications for a new generation of WAP fully compatible with the Internet will be out,'' Mr. Tsujimura said. ''Then there will be no distinction between WAP and i-mode.''</p>
