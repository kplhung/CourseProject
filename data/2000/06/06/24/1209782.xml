        <p>ANY journalist who covers the Upper West Side quickly becomes combat-hardened, but even the veterans at The West Side Spirit have never seen anything like the current war. It was set off by their front-page headline: ''Your Kids Are Driving Me Crazy!''</p>
        <p>The battle cry came from Gail Bryce, a nonparent appalled at the children running amok in her Starbucks. The Upper West Side has become ''a giant day care center,'' she complained, while a populace famed for kvetching remained silent.</p>
        <p>''We let baby carriages and strollers steamroll over us on crowded sidewalks and in stores, as if it's a papal edict that they have the right of way,'' she wrote in an article last month. ''We let brats terrorize us in restaurants. We stand passively on public transportation, looking down at the tops of the heads of kids who are riding for free in the seats that should go to us fare-paying adults.''</p>
        <p>She announced a new campaign for adult rights, prompting a deluge of letters for and against children -- mostly against. ''We've never gotten so much mail on any issue,'' said Tom Allon, the publisher and editor in chief, who bravely stood by the article despite having three children of his own. ''I was the prototype parent she had in mind.''</p>
        <p>So am I, and I'm tempted to fire back at the child-bashers. Whom do these self-absorbed Manhattanites expect to support them in their old age? They should be thanking us for providing their Social Security. And why are they living on the Upper West Side if they can't stand children? There are plenty of child-unfriendly neighborhoods out there.</p>
        <p>But I can't help sympathizing with Ms. Bryce's band of activists. In a place as congested and cramped as Manhattan, other people's children are a special burden. Until my own perfect child arrived, I shared their belief that this island should operate like the one on ''Survivor.'' When parenthood hits, a voice should announce, ''It's time for you to go.''</p>
        <p>IF parents insist on staying, they have to make peace with the childless majority. Here, to start negotiations, are a couple of olive branches:</p>
        <p>Demilitarized zones. Any peace process begins by separating the combatants. Already, there are informal child-free refuges: cafes with tables too closely packed for strollers, restaurants with menus too pricey for families.</p>
        <p>But some New Yorkers refuse to take a hint. They need to see the equivalent of a no-smoking sign clearly posted at the door: a baby with a red slash across it.</p>
        <p>Baby-occupied territories are already easy to recognize by the stroller gridlock at the door. Even the most obtuse babyphobe knows to avoid a restaurant with crayons at the table. But just to be clear, there could be a universal baby-friendly symbol at the door -- a waiter smiling as a child in a high chair pelts him with Cheerios.</p>
        <p>The brat tax. Children shorter than 44 inches are allowed to ride free on subways and buses, and they infuriate some adults when they take up a seat. In the old days, as the adult-rights activists point out, there were signs telling parents: ''Little enough to ride for free. Little enough to ride your knee.''</p>
        <p>Parents could assuage some of the activists by giving up the seats, but it may be better to reconsider the whole question. If you think of a screaming child as an environmental disturbance, then giving a child a discount is like offering a subsidy to a polluter.</p>
        <p>A child should pay at least full fare, and the fairest policy would be to impose a surcharge, as The Economist magazine once explained in analyzing the ''negative externalities'' created by children in another cramped, congested environment.</p>
        <p>The Economist proposed that airlines segregate families at the back of the plane and charge children more than adults. The surcharge could be used to subsidize a buffer zone: a row of seats in front of the children for adults willing to endure noise in return for a special discount.</p>
        <p>It would be complicated to set up subsidized buffer zones and special children's fares in the subway, but a brave restaurateur could certainly try the experiment. Parents wouldn't like paying extra for kiddie meals, of course, but in one way they too would benefit -- or at least the ones who now sit mortified when their kids turn into monsters.</p>
        <p>With a brat tax, they could hold their heads high as their little darlings rampaged. If any nearby diners glared, if any adult-rights activists tried to complain, the parent could smile and calmly reply, ''I paid for that tantrum.''</p>
