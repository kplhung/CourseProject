        <p>Neither the Rangers, the Devils nor the Islanders lost any significant players today when the two expansion teams, the Columbus Blue Jackets and the Minnesota Wild, each drafted 26 veterans as they joined the National Hockey League.</p>
        <p>But the Devils used leverage from the draft to acquire someone they think is important: Turner Stevenson, a Montreal forward who was drafted by Columbus.</p>
        <p>Because the Devils had traded Krzysztof Oliwa to Columbus earlier this month for future considerations, the Blue Jackets sent Stevenson to the Devils right after the draft to complete the deal.</p>
        <p>''This is a character kid,'' General Manager Lou Lamoriello said when asked to describe the 6-foot-3, 215-pound veteran. ''Competes as hard as they come. He's a prototype, Devil-type forward. He's not going to score 30 goals. He's a third-line, fourth-line strong wing who plays, hits and can fight.''</p>
        <p>The expansion selections were the highlight on the first day of a three-day convention in the Saddledome. On Saturday the league will conduct the first three rounds of the entry draft of amateurs, most of them 18 years old. The draft will end Sunday.</p>
        <p>Last season with Montreal, Stevenson played in 64 games with 8 goals, 13 assists and 61 penalty minutes. The Devils also sent defenseman Deron Quint to Columbus as part of the Stevenson deal. Quint played only four games with the Devils after coming from Phoenix in a trade.</p>
        <p>In other draft moves, the Devils lost the backup goalie Chris Terreri to Minnesota, but they reacquired him, along with Minnesota's ninth-round pick this season, in exchange for defenseman Brad Bombardir.</p>
        <p>The Rangers lost two players to Columbus. They were defenseman Mathieu Schneider, an unrestricted free agent, and forward Dmitri Subbotin. The Islanders lost forward Ted Drury to Columbus and defenseman Ian Herbers to Minnesota.</p>
        <p>Few well-known names were involved in the draft, either because they are unrestricted free agents or they make large salaries. Mark Messier, the former Ranger who played the last three seasons for the Vancouver Canucks, was not chosen. The Rangers are thought to be interested in obtaining him after July 1 if the Canucks buy out the last year of his contract, as expected.</p>
        <p>Among the best-known players chosen by Columbus were defenseman Lyle Odelein from Phoenix and the forwards Geoff Sanderson from Buffalo, Kevyn Adams from Toronto, Dallas Drake from Phoenix and Kevin Dineen from Ottawa.</p>
        <p>Among the best-known players chosen by Minnesota were goalie Mike Vernon from Florida, defenseman Sean O'Donnell from Los Angeles and the forwards Jeff Odgers from Colorado and Cam Stewart from Florida.</p>
        <p>Those rosters are not fixed, however. Many of the chosen players are expected to be dealt before the season, some before the end of the weekend. Vernon, 37, was traded to Calgary by the Wild before the day ended.</p>
        <p>Columbus and Minnesota are the 29th and 30th teams in the league, which had 21 teams as recently as the summer of 1991. Since then, four existing franchises have moved.</p>
