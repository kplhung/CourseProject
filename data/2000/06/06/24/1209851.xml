        <p>Frank Castillo won his third straight start as host Toronto beat Boston, 5-4, last night.</p>
        <p>Raul Mondesi hit a go-ahead, two-run homer for the Blue Jays, and Brad Fullmer and Jose Cruz Jr. also connected.</p>
        <p>Toronto, which leads the American League East by a half-game, had not led the division this late in the season since 1993, the year the Blue Jays won their second straight World Series title.</p>
        <p>Castillo (4-5) allowed four runs and six hits in seven and one-third innings, retiring 15 straight before consecutive doubles by Darren Lewis and Jeff Frye with one out in the eighth pulled Boston to 5-3. Carl Everett then hit a run-scoring ouble off Billy Koch, who got four outs for his 16th save.</p>
        <p>John Wasdin (0-3), making his first start since 1998, gave up five runs and seven hits in four innings.</p>
        <p>Solo homers by Trot Nixon in the first and Everett in the second put Boston ahead, but Toronto tied the game in the second on Fullmer's homer and Homer Bush's run-scoring single.</p>
        <p>Mondesi's 17th homer gave Toronto a 4-2 lead in the third, and Cruz added his 16th in the fourth. The Blue Jays have homered in a club record 21 straight games.</p>
        <p>TIGERS 7, INDIANS 6: Juan Gonzalez had two hits and scored twice as Detroit won in Cleveland.</p>
        <p>Willie Blair (4-1) allowed five hits in six and two-thirds innings as the Tigers improved to 5-4 against the Indians this season.</p>
        <p>Last-place Detroit, just 8-32 at the Jake, took two of three at home from the Indians last weekend, putting second-place Cleveland farther back in the American League Central race behind Chicago.</p>
        <p>Tony Clark hit a two-run homer off Jamie Navarro (0-1) and Juan Encarnacion had three hits and two runs batted in for the Tigers.</p>
        <p>David Justice and Kenny Lofton homered for the Indians.</p>
        <p>Blair, who got a no-decision in a start against Cleveland last Sunday, walked two and struck out five.</p>
        <p>Gonzalez could not come up with Travis Fryman's R.B.I. triple off the wall with two outs in the eighth, and Justice hit an R.B.I. double off Doug Brocail as the Indians closed to 7-6.</p>
        <p>But after allowing the tying run to reach second with one out in the ninth, Todd Jones struck out Omar Vizquel and Roberto Alomar for his league-leading 20th save.</p>
        <p>DEVIL RAYS 7, RANGERS 4: Gerald Williams led off the game with a home run and later broke a tie with a sacrifice fly as visiting Tampa Bay beat Texas and extended Rick Helling's losing streak to six games.</p>
        <p>Helling (7-7) retired 14 batters in a row after the Williams homer, but was chased from the game after the first four Devil Rays in the seventh got hits, including an R.B.I. double by Steve Cox and an R.B.I. single by Bobby Smith.</p>
        <p>Felix Martinez greeted the reliever Jeff Zimmerman with an R.B.I. single that tied the game at 4-4. Williams followed with his sacrifice fly to deep left that capped the four-run outburst.</p>
        <p>Cory Lidle (1-2) pitched six innings to win for the first time as a major league starter.</p>
