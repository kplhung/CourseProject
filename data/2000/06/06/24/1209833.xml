        <p>One of Juan Gonzalez's agents stressed today that his client had not rejected a trade to the Yankees and that he still had an interest in playing for New York. That kept alive the possibility that Gonzalez could soon be acquired from the Detroit Tigers.</p>
        <p>''He's got an open mind about going to the Yankees,'' Fernando Cuza, the agent, said. ''He's got an open mind about talking to the Yankees.''</p>
        <p>Cuza and the Yankees had brief discussions today about what it would take to persuade Gonzalez to join the two-time defending world champions. The Yankees and the Tigers agreed on Thursday to a deal in principle that would send outfielder Ricky Ledee, the top prospect and third baseman Drew Henson and the Class AA left-handed pitcher Randy Keisler to Detroit for Gonzalez.</p>
        <p>Cuza said the main reason he contacted a member of the Yankees' hierarchy was to clarify Gonzalez's position and refute reports that said Gonzalez had invoked his right to veto the trade. The Yankees have a 72-hour window that ends at noon Sunday to try to agree to terms with Gonzalez. Both sides could petition the commissioner's office to extend the window, and the request would almost certainly be granted.</p>
        <p>''The only thing that we wanted to get across to the Yankees today was that those rumors reported about Juan vetoing the trade were not true,'' Cuza said.</p>
        <p>But there could still be a stumbling block, because Cuza and another friend of Gonzalez's said the slugging right fielder would probably not be interested in signing a long-term deal. It seemed doubtful the Yankees would give up three young players to rent Gonzalez for the last three months of the season. Gonzalez agreed to leave Texas and play this season for the Tigers, but he turned down Detroit's long-term deal -- eight years and $140 million -- after he was obtained from the Rangers. The Yankees, whose suggestion of a one-year extension to Gonzalez was not accepted, would probably have to offer close to $140 million. Apparently, Gonzalez would still be reluctant to sign such a lengthy extension without having played a day as a Yankee.</p>
        <p>''Juan is more likely to want to play the rest of the year out and see how the chemistry is and how things are,'' Cuza said. ''I think once he goes there, he'll feel like he wants to stay and work something out.''</p>
        <p>Another friend of Gonzalez's, who has spoken with him and who insisted on anonymity, added, ''He'll waive his trade veto and he won't ask for anything to waive it, but he doesn't want a contract extension.''</p>
        <p>Do the Yankees want the 30-year-old Gonzalez desperately enough to give up three players without guarantees that they will have him beyond the 2000 season? It seems unlikely. But the Yankees could try to include lesser prospects in the trade, they could hope Gonzalez comes to the Bronx and falls in love with the team, or they could decide that adding the two-time American League most valuable player to their needy offense is worth the current price, even if it is only for the rest of the season.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't make sense with him not wanting to leave Detroit,'' Paul O'Neill said. ''Does it? I don't see how that makes sense.''</p>
        <p>The uncertainty about whether Gonzalez would be joining the Yankees filled the visiting clubhouse before the Yankees played the White Sox tonight. Bernie Williams, who played in youth baseball leagues with Gonzalez in Puerto Rico when they were 15 years old, said he would gladly call Gonzalez and talk to him about the positive aspects of New York.</p>
        <p>''If the team wants me to talk to him, I'll be willing to do it,'' Williams said. ''If he has questions, I'd be more than happy to talk to him.''</p>
        <p>Gonzalez told a reporter in Detroit tonight that if Williams wanted to talk to him, he would definitely want to talk to Williams, too.</p>
        <p>Joe Torre refused to discuss the Gonzalez situation, other than admitting that he met with Ledee and told him to ignore the trade speculation, because the manager would be the first one to tell him if he were traded. Other than a slump in the second half of the 1996 season and the drama of the postseason, Torre called the spectacle created by the Gonzalez and Sammy Sosa rumors ''the toughest distraction we've had to deal with.'' The Cubs have asked the Yankees for at least five of their elite prospects for Sosa, and those discussions have not advanced.</p>
        <p>Ledee has been distracted. Orlando Hernandez rushed up to Ledee in an animated fashion and asked him why he was still with the team. Ledee smiled, but he is so worried and had such a bad headache that he took five pain relievers before the game. Still, Ledee knows his future is probably tied to Gonzalez's decision, and he is honest about what could happen.</p>
        <p>''He's got money, he's got M.V.P.'s, he's got everything you could want,'' Ledee said. ''He said he wants to win. Why wouldn't he come here?''</p>
        <p>Williams said Gonzalez has often been booed as an opposing player at Yankee Stadium. Williams added that Gonzalez was emotional and private, and that did not always translate well in New York, where the attention and the expectations are intense. But Williams looked around the clubhouse at a core of players who have won three of the last four World Series and wondered if Gonzalez could see exactly what he saw.</p>
        <p>''I just can't see him passing up this opportunity with where he could be and where he's playing now,'' Williams said. ''Nothing against Detroit, but he's got a chance to win if he comes here. He's won all the individual awards. If he goes on and plays his whole career and doesn't win, he'll think about this.''</p>
