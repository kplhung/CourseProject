        <p>China is modernizing its armed forces to counter military threats from technologically superior enemies, but ''significant shortcomings'' in its weapons and training will leave it unable to challenge the United States for ''an indefinite period of time,'' according to a Pentagon study released today.</p>

        <p>China is modernizing its armed forces to counter military threats from technologically superior enemies, but ''significant shortcomings'' in its weapons and training will leave it unable to challenge the United States for ''an indefinite period of time,'' according to a Pentagon study released today.</p>
        <p>The Pentagon's report said China's military modernization efforts are also increasing its ability to threaten Taiwan, especially with long-range missiles. But the study concluded that the People's Liberation Army, hobbled by limitations in fighter aircraft and amphibious ships, would not fare well if ordered to invade Taiwan in the near future.</p>
        <p>''In the short term (2000-2005), the P.L.A. will have only a limited capability to conduct integrated operations against Taiwan,'' the unclassified version of a longer classified study said.</p>
        <p>The study, one of a series mandated by Congress, will almost certainly fuel the debate over the future of China's military and focus new attention on the diplomatically perilous issue of arms sales to Taiwan.</p>
        <p>Because the study analyzed both strengths and weaknesses in the Chinese military, its findings amounted to a Rorschach test, providing critics and supporters of the Clinton administration's policies toward China evidence to support their views.</p>
        <p>''You can get whatever you want out of this report,'' one Pentagon official said today.</p>
        <p>Representative Christopher Cox, a California Republican and one of Capitol Hill's most ardent hawks on China, said the study highlighted  President Clinton's failed efforts to engage China and the need ''to view the People's Republic of China as a strategic competitor, rather than a strategic ally.''</p>
        <p>At the same time, the analysis concluded that China's leadership, headed by President Jiang Zemin, remained ''largely preoccupied by domestic concerns,'' more than military and national security issues.</p>
        <p>It said that in the aftermath of NATO's air war against Yugoslavia and the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, some Chinese officials ''seriously considered'' giving defense a higher priority, but that the leadership ''reaffirmed its priority emphasis'' on economic growth during its annual retreat last August.</p>
        <p>Even so, a potential conflict with Taiwan involving the United States has become ''the dominant scenario'' guiding the Chinese military's planning and weapons development, it said. The military, while lagging technologically, has been pouring resources into devising strategies and weapons to exploit American weaknesses, it found.</p>
        <p>The Chinese have also devoted enormous efforts to developing means of ''electromagnetic warfare'' and attacks on computer and communications networks. And they have an ''aggressive program'' to buy weapons from Russia, including  missiles, attack submarines and,  most recently, two destroyers.</p>
        <p>The report, which relied on intelligence findings as well as writings of China's military strategists, said the Chinese had carefully studied the 1991 Persian Gulf war and NATO's air war against Yugoslavia, where American-led forces used overwhelming force and technological superiority to crush the enemy. The analysis found that much of China's research and training now centers on countering just such an attack, by developing or buying missiles and other weapons that could threaten advanced aircraft.</p>
        <p>Still, while China is restructuring its armed forces, its air force and navy remain too antiquated and ill-equipped to launch a serious invasion of Taiwan or other countries in the region. The navy's amphibious transport ships could carry only one infantry division across the Taiwan Strait, leaving other troops dependent on trawlers and fishing boats.</p>
        <p>The report's findings are likely to intensify pressure on the United States to sell more and more advanced weapons to Taiwan to counter the Chinese buildup. China has strongly opposed sales to Taiwan, which it considers a renegade province. In April, the administration approved a sale of upgraded missiles and a long-range radar system, but refused Taiwan's request for four of the most advanced American destroyers.</p>
        <p>Despite tensions, the report plays down the likelihood of open conflict between China and Taiwan, arguing that Beijing would avoid anything that risked its economic growth and access to foreign markets.</p>
        <p>''In initiating a military conflict with Taiwan, Beijing would run the risk of jeopardizing both its continued economic development and its political standing,'' the report concluded. ''China's resolve to employ military force, however, should not be discounted.''</p>
