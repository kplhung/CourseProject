        <p>The New York Times Book Review will print a separate best-seller list for children's books starting on July 23. The change is largely in response to the expected demand for the fourth in the Harry Potter series of children's books, editors at the Book Review said.</p>

        <p>The New York Times Book Review will print a separate best-seller list for children's books starting on July 23. The change is largely in response to the expected demand for the fourth in the Harry Potter series of children's books, editors at the Book Review said.</p>
        <p>The new Harry Potter book, the title and plot of which are being kept secret by the publisher, Levine/Scholastic, is scheduled for release on July 8. With an enormous initial print run of 3.8 million in the United States alone, it is widely expected to reach the top of the list.</p>
        <p>''The time has come when we need to clear some room'' on the list, said Charles McGrath, the editor of the Book Review, which appears weekly in the paper's Sunday issue.</p>
        <p>Editors said that the idea of adding a children's list, in addition to the three hardcover lists for fiction, nonfiction, and ''advice, how-to and miscellaneous'' and separate lists for paperbacks in those categories, had been under consideration for some time. The new list will mix all categories of children's books together, fiction and nonfiction, but in the beginning will show only hardcover sales. Like the adult list, the children's list will have 15 slots.</p>
        <p>Some publishers have been advocating such a move for months, complaining that a cluster of popular children's books can keep deserving adult books off the lists. On Feb. 27, for instance, a third of the places on the hardcover fiction list had children's books: three Harry Potter books, ''The Legend of Luke'' by Brian Jacques and ''Bud, Not Buddy'' by Christopher Paul Curtis.</p>
        <p>The Harry Potter books, a series by the British author J. K. Rowling about a young magician in training at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, will have been on the list for 79 weeks tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Keeping the Harry Potter books on the adult list also has its advocates, said Deborah Hofmann, the editor of the best-seller List. ''There are those who would argue that these books have a strong following among adult readers.''</p>
        <p>But editors said that the change was supported by booksellers. ''Booksellers who report their weekly sales figures to us have responded enthusiastically,'' Ms. Hofmann said, ''because more room is now available.''</p>
        <p>The new list will include both picture and chapter books, unlike the Publishers Weekly children's best-seller list, which divides books into  categories, including picture, chapter and paperback books. The children's list will be derived from the same sources as the adult list. The Times does not disclose those sources, but they include about 4,000 bookstores and scores of wholesalers that sell to some 50,000 different outlets, including gift shops and department stores. Sales from children's bookstores are expected to be added to the rankings.</p>
        <p>Some books, like the Harry Potter series and the novels of John Grisham, can make their debut at the top of the list, although it usually takes two weeks or so after the publication date for information about sales to be collected and printed.</p>
        <p>In some cases books that are published close together and are part of the same series are listed simply by the series title.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hofmann said that the Book Review would ''for the most part be guided by the publisher's own sense of whether the book is adult- or youth-oriented. But, for instance, if it has been reviewed as an adult book and retailers tell us it's getting most of its sales from the youth market, we would be open to further discussion.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McGrath noted that ''if another 'Harry Potter' came along, even if it were only on the children's list, if it were a true crossover book, it would be noticed'' by the public. ''Being on the kids' best-seller list wouldn't ghettoize it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>To accommodate the new children's list, the two pages of the Book Review on which the adult hardcover and paperback best-seller lists appear have been redesigned. The ''Advice and How To'' hardcover list, at the bottom of the hardcover list, is moving to the paperback best-seller page.</p>
        <p>The new children's book list will replace ''advice, how-to and miscellaneous'' at the bottom of the hardcover page.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. McGrath said, ''I don't want to rule out the possibility we will adjust this. This is a work in progress.''</p>
