        <p>When Attorney General Janet Reno appointed Robert J. Conrad Jr. to direct the Justice Department's campaign finance task force late last year, she praised his prosecutorial skills and said she expected him to ''expand upon the successes'' of the campaign finance inquiry.</p>
        <p>Barely six months later, Mr. Conrad handed her a political hot potato by recommending that she appoint an independent counsel to investigate Vice President Al Gore's involvement in fund-raising for the 1996 presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Conrad, 42, earned a reputation as a skilled prosecutor and trial attorney during more than 10 years in the United States attorney's office in Charlotte, N.C., say those who have worked with him. From 1992 until last year, Mr. Conrad was chief of the office's criminal division.</p>
        <p>Mr. Conrad's former boss in Charlotte, United States Attorney Mark Calloway, called Mr. Conrad one of the most capable prosecutors he had ever worked with. ''He is a relentless investigator and has a high sense of duty and fairness,'' Mr. Calloway said when Mr. Conrad was appointed to the Justice Department post last December.</p>
        <p>A former North Carolina attorney general, Lacy H. Thornburg, praised Mr. Conrad's courtroom skills. ''Bob is a seasoned prosecutor and skilled trial attorney,'' Mr. Thornburg said.</p>
        <p>But Democratic officials today questioned Mr. Conrad's impartiality, noting that he had contributed $250 in 1996 to the re-election campaign of Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, a staunch conservative Republican and a consistent foe of the Clinton administration.</p>
        <p>The donation to Mr. Helms is apparently the only political contribution Mr. Conrad has ever made, according to federal election records.</p>
        <p>Mr. Conrad went to work for the United States attorney's office in 1989 when he was hired by Tom Ashcraft, then the United States attorney who had been a member of Mr. Helms's Senate staff. Mr. Ashcraft, who served on the board of the Jesse Helms Center, a foundation controlled by the senator, was appointed to the United States attorney's post by President Ronald Reagan in 1987.</p>
        <p>Mr. Conrad is a graduate of the University of Virginia Law School and Clemson University, where he was both a basketball star and an academic all-American.</p>
        <p>Ms. Reno established the campaign finance task force in 1996 to investigate accusations of illegality in the 1996 presidential campaign. The task force has indicted 22 people for campaign finance abuses over the last four years.</p>
