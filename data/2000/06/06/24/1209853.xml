        <p>John Rocker bounced back from a poor outing to strike out the side in the ninth inning, preserving the Atlanta Braves' 3-2 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers last night at Turner Field.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, the controversial reliever gave up five runs, four walks and one hit in a third of an inning against the Chicago Cubs.</p>
        <p>This time, Rocker got his second save since May 18, his 12th in 13 chances this season.</p>
        <p>Rocker relieved to start the ninth and struck out James Mouton leading off, then walked Jose Hernandez, Rocker's 31st walk in 21 innings. He then struck out Henry Blanco and Lyle Mouton, raising his season strikeout total to 33.</p>
        <p>Andres Galarraga hit his 18th homer and a run-scoring double to back John Burkett, who left after six innings with a 2-1 lead. But Jason Marquis (1-0) allowed Marquis Grissom's homer leading off the eighth.</p>
        <p>Quilvio Veras's sacrifice fly in the eighth off David Weathers (3-3) drove in the go-ahead run.</p>
        <p>PADRES 10, REDS 7: Bret Boone tormented his former club by hitting three homers and Ruben Rivera added a three-run shot in the 10th inning, powering San Diego at Cincinnati.</p>
        <p>The Reds tied the score with three runs in the ninth off Trevor Hoffman (1-2), who blew only his second save in 20 chances. Ken Griffey Jr.'s two-out, two-run double tied the score, 7-7.</p>
        <p>Scott Williamson (2-5), struggling to duplicate his rookie-of-the-year season, gave up Tony Gwynn's pinch-hit double to open the 10th, then walked Boone intentionally with two outs. Rivera hit the second pitch for his seventh homer, extending the Reds' free fall. Cincinnati has lost 13 of 16.</p>
        <p>DIAMONDBACKS 2, ROCKIES 0: Brian Anderson allowed two hits over eight innings and Danny Bautista hit a solo homer to lead host Arizona.</p>
        <p>The N.L. West-leading Diamondbacks won for the third time in four games and moved two games ahead of the Rockies, who have lost three of four since moving into a first-place tie June 18.</p>
        <p>Anderson (7-2), who had given up at least seven earned runs in two of his last three starts, allowed only singles by Jeffrey Hammonds and Larry Walker.</p>
        <p>Byung-Hyun Kim struck out the side in the ninth for his 10th save in 12 chances.</p>
        <p>PHILLIES 13, EXPOS 6: Mike Lieberthal and Mickey Morandini each fell a hit short of the cycle and Scott Rolen had a three-run homer and four runs batted in as Philadelphia won at Montreal.</p>
        <p>Lieberthal had a home run, double and single and scored four runs, while Morandini had a single, double and triple with three R.B.I. to lead the Phillies' 17-hit barrage against five Expos pitchers.</p>
        <p>Mike David Coggin (1-0), who had never pitched above Class AA, won in his major league debut.</p>
        <p>GIANTS 10, ASTROS 3: In just 35 games at Enron Field, more home runs were hit than all of last season at the Astrodome. Barry Bonds, Marvin Benard and Bobby Estalella homered in the first six innings of San Francisco's rout of Houston.</p>
        <p>Throw in Chris Truby's ninth-inning homer off Alan Embree, the first of his career, and there have been 120 homers at Enron, two more than were hit last year at the Astrodome, Houston's home park from 1965 to 1999.</p>
        <p>Jose Lima (1-11) lost his 11th straight decision.</p>
        <p>MARLINS 6, CUBS 1: Mike Lowell's two-run home run highlighted a four-run fifth inning as host Florida defeated Chicago.</p>
        <p>Luis Castillo had four singles in five at-bats for Florida, improving his average to .365.</p>
        <p>ASTROS COACHES DISMISSED: The Astros, who have the worst record in the major leagues, dismissed their pitching coach, Vern Ruhle, and their hitting coach, Tom McCraw, on Friday and replaced them with Burt Hooton and Harry Spilman.</p>
        <p>CARDINALS' OROSCO ON D.L.: Jesse Orosco returned to the disabled list for the second time this season -- and only the second time in his 22-year career -- because of a sore elbow.</p>
        <p>McGwire's 549th Passes Schmidt</p>
        <p>Mark McGwire hit his 549th home run to pass Mike Schmidt for seventh on the career list last night in the Cardinals' game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in St. Louis.</p>
        <p>McGwire tied Barry Bonds for the major league lead with his 27th homer, connecting on a 1-1 pitch from Matt Herges leading off the eighth. He drove the ball 411 feet to center, tying the score at 5-5.</p>
        <p>Next on the list is Reggie Jackson at 563.</p>
