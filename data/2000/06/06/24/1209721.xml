        <p>The time was ripe for a dance party on Monday at Irving Plaza. A giant pair of headphones was parked outside, designed by students from the School of Visual Arts using a grant (and two cars, incorporated into the sculpture) from the evening's sponsor, Toyota. A film and video installation enhanced the rave-like environment.</p>
        <p>Lately, however, some dance music experimenters have been following their hypotheses to the dance floor. Hip-hop has the Roots, and techno has Moby, who loves his electric guitar. Judging from Monday's featured acts, Groove Armada and Faze Action, English clubgoers prefer an old-fashioned funk revue spiked with high-proof samples and beats.</p>

        <p>The time was ripe for a dance party on Monday at Irving Plaza. A giant pair of headphones was parked outside, designed by students from the School of Visual Arts using a grant (and two cars, incorporated into the sculpture) from the evening's sponsor, Toyota. A film and video installation enhanced the rave-like environment.</p>
        <p>Lately, however, some dance music experimenters have been following their hypotheses to the dance floor. Hip-hop has the Roots, and techno has Moby, who loves his electric guitar. Judging from Monday's featured acts, Groove Armada and Faze Action, English clubgoers prefer an old-fashioned funk revue spiked with high-proof samples and beats.</p>
        <p>Both groups record as DJ duos. Tom Findlay and Andy Cato have created a sensation with Groove Armada's witty, texturally rich montages. Faze Action, masterminded by the brothers Robin and Simon Lee, adheres to a more classic disc-funk sound. Faze Action delivered that order with jovial aplomb. Robin Lee, playing bass, held down the bottom in a sound that invoked James Brown and ''The Hustle,'' while the horn players Michael Ball and Richard Waragent added a wash of tones that blended with Simon Lee's programming. The veteran dance-pop vocalist Zeke Manyika added atmospheric croons and moans.</p>
        <p>The band was charming, but the crowd was there for Groove Armada. Serious dancers love this duo's smart but accessible hits, which graft memorable vocal lines onto shifting musical arrangements. The dancers are drawn in by the big splash of the hook, and stay for the music's undertow.</p>
        <p>Enthusiasm made up for rough skills in Groove Armada's attempt to recreate the flow of its recordings. Mr. Cato was the musical standout on trombone. There was a nice shouter's edge, but not much dynamic range. The seven-piece band bopped around the arrangements without locking in.</p>
        <p>The group's zest and the crowd's love won out, however, creating a first-class party vibe. Groove Armada deserves points for taking on the challenge of a traditional live show. Its songs were strong enough to let the band coast. It was a party, this is summer and no one complained.</p>
