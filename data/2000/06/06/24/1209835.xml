        <p>ConAgra Inc. said yesterday that it had agreed to buy International Home Foods Inc. for about $1.6 billion in cash and stock in a deal that would put Chef Boyardee pasta, Gulden's mustard and PAM cooking spray into ConAgra's corporate pantry. Shareholders of International Home, based in Parsippany, N.J., will receive $22 a share, half in cash and half in ConAgra stock -- about 44 percent more than International Home's closing stock price of $15.31 on Thursday. ConAgra, based in Omaha, with brands like Orville Redenbacher popcorn, Swiss Miss hot chocolate, Hebrew National and Armour meats, will also assume $1.3 billion of International Home debt.</p>
