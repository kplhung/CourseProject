        <p>In a caustic exchange with a senior Justice Department prosecutor two months ago, Vice President Al Gore denied being told by aides that a 1996 luncheon at a Buddhist temple was a fund-raising event, according to a transcript of the interview that the vice president's lawyers released today.</p>

        <p>In a caustic exchange with a senior Justice Department prosecutor two months ago, Vice President Al Gore denied being told by aides that a 1996 luncheon at a Buddhist temple was a fund-raising event, according to a transcript of the interview that the vice president's lawyers released today.</p>
        <p>''I sure as hell don't recall having -- I sure as hell did not have any conversations with anyone saying this is a fund-raising event,'' Mr. Gore said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's angry denial was contained in a 123-page transcript of a four-hour interview in which the head of the Justice Department's campaign finance unit questioned Mr. Gore at the vice presidential mansion April 18 about his fund-raising activities before the 1996 election.</p>
        <p>The vice president released the interview transcript this afternoon, scrambling to blunt the potential damage of the revived Justice Department inquiry of his truthfulness in answering questions about his efforts to raise money. Still, it risked prolonging an issue that has dogged Mr. Gore's presidential campaign and threatens to bring renewed comparisons to the scandals of the Clinton administration.</p>
        <p>''I have always cooperated fully,'' Mr. Gore told reporters aboard Air Force II this afternoon, as he flew from Denver to Palo Alto, Calif.</p>
        <p>''I have admitted that I have made mistakes in fund-raising,'' he said in the middle of a chaotic day in which he and his aides sought to contain the latest problem to confront his presidential campaign. ''But I want the American people to know that I have always told the truth on this matter. I have always cooperated fully. And I want the entire transcript to be out there, and I want people to be able to judge it for themselves.''</p>
        <p>Later, Mr. Gore said, ''I think the truth is my friend in this. The truth, the full truth and nothing but the truth.''</p>
        <p>In the interview, Mr. Gore was confronted with questions about a wide array of campaign finance issues, posed by a clearly skeptical and at times incredulous prosecutor, Robert J. Conrad Jr., the head of the campaign finance task force. Besides the Buddhist temple luncheon, Mr. Gore was asked whether the White House coffees were fund-raising events and what he knew about missing e-mail messages from his office.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's decision to release the transcript came a day after the Justice Department confirmed that Mr. Conrad had recommended last week that Attorney General Janet Reno appoint a special counsel to investigate the truthfulness of Mr. Gore's statements about his fund-raising.</p>
        <p>But the vice president today questioned the timing of the disclosure of the new inquiry. ''Here we are four months before an election that takes place every four years,'' Mr. Gore said. ''You can read into that what you want to.''</p>
        <p>Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, today seized on the renewed inquiry into Mr. Gore's fund-raising. ''I reiterate my call for a new tone in Washington which is going to require a new administration in Washington,'' Mr. Bush said. ''People are sick and tired of all this stuff and the best way to start anew is with a new administration.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has clearly made the political calculation that the public will regard the transcript, filled with questions about events that occurred as long ago as 1989, as old news.</p>
        <p>''I have full confidence in the judgment of the American people,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's answers during the April 18 interview at times appeared to conflict with conclusions reached by a 1997 inquiry by a Senate panel that investigated campaign finance issues. When it was first issued, Mr. Gore dismissed the Senate report as ''a highly partisan document.''</p>
        <p>At one point in the April 18 interview, Mr. Gore insisted that the 103 coffee sessions with campaign donors held at the White House in 1995 and 1996 were not ''fund-raising tools'' used to raise money for the Democratic Party.</p>
        <p>The Senate panel, led by Senator Fred Thompson, a Tennessee Republican, found in 1997 that supporters at the coffee events from November 1995 to October 1996 contributed a total of $7.7 million within one month of having attended them.</p>
        <p>During the questioning, Mr. Gore recalled that he had remembered ''only one that I attended briefly.'' But the Senate panel found he had played host at 23 of the sessions and attended 8 with President Clinton. Confronted with the contradictory information, Mr. Gore said, ''That seems inaccurate to me.''</p>
        <p>As a legal matter, the apparent conflicts with Mr. Gore's statements may fall short of sufficient grounds to show that he perjured himself, law enforcement officials said today. That is one reason, the officials said, that Ms. Reno has so far shown no sign that she is prepared to refer the case to an outside prosecutor.</p>
        <p>Ms. Reno, after searing internal battles in 1997 and 1998, refused to seek an independent counsel to investigate Mr. Gore's fund-raising efforts over the objections of some senior advisers.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Conrad is not alone in his recommendation to refer the case to a special prosecutor, the officials said today. The F.B.I. director, Louis J. Freeh, also favors a special counsel and has long urged Ms. Reno to make the referral.</p>
        <p>During the four-hour interview, Mr. Conrad led the questioning of Mr. Gore, assisted by two F.B.I. agents. Mr. Conrad devoted most of the time to Mr. Gore's understanding of the true purpose of the Buddhist temple event, a subject Mr. Gore had not been asked about in four previous interviews with investigators from the campaign finance unit.</p>
        <p>Mr. Conrad repeatedly showed Mr. Gore numerous memorandums, all of which had been made public years ago, from aides suggesting that it was known that the event was intended to raise money.</p>
        <p>''You were aware in late February, were you not, that there was a goal of raising $108 million by the D.N.C.?'' Mr. Conrad asked, referring to the Democratic National Committee.</p>
        <p>''Yes,'' Mr. Gore replied.</p>
        <p>''Then a couple of months later there is a D.N.C.-sponsored event at the temple, and it didn't raise any fund-raising issues in your mind?'' Mr. Conrad went on.</p>
        <p>''I did not know this was a fund-raiser,'' Mr. Gore answered.</p>
        <p>Later in the interview, Mr. Gore inadvertently referred to the temple event as a ''fund-raiser.'' The vice president's personal lawyer, James F. Neal, quickly advised Mr. Gore that he had misspoken.</p>
        <p>Mr. Neal told the vice president, ''I thought you said previously you didn't, you still don't know whether it was a fund-raiser.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore then replied, ''Well, that's right. That is more accurate. Let me, let me amend that. That was first time it was alleged to be, to have been a fund-raiser.''</p>
        <p>The event at the Hsi Lai temple, on April 29, 1996, in Hacienda Heights, Calif., was one of the most embarrassing episodes of the 1996 campaign finance scandal. The event was organized by Maria Hsia, a longtime political ally of the vice president who had collected money before the event from monks and nuns, some of whom had taken vows of poverty. As a tax-exempt religious institution, the temple was not allowed to serve as a venue for political fund-raising or to make political donations itself.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hsia was convicted in March for hiding $109,000 in illegal contributions and making false statements to federal regulators about the temple luncheon. She is awaiting sentencing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore was asked repeatedly in late 1996 and 1997 about whether he knew the event was a fund-raiser, and, Mr. Conrad said, responded with differing statements.</p>
        <p>From the start, and again in the April 18 interview, Mr. Gore insisted that he did not learn that the luncheon was used to raise money until several months after it had occurred. In between, he said in numerous interviews with reporters that he had believed the luncheon to be a ''community outreach event.''</p>
        <p>''There was no solicitation of money,'' Mr. Gore said in the April 18 interview. ''I did not see any money or checks change hands. I never heard it discussed. Nor do I believe it took place, incidentally.''</p>
        <p>He told Mr. Conrad, ''Perhaps you know that some money changed hands there. But to this day, I don't think any did.''</p>
        <p>Today at the Justice Department, Ms. Reno acknowledged that prosecutors had embarked on a renewed investigation of Mr. Gore's statements under oath about his political fund-raising practices during the 1996 presidential race.</p>
        <p>Speaking at her weekly news conference, Ms. Reno said she would ignore the partisan passions surrounding the election-year inquiry.</p>
        <p>''The most important thing in any investigation, particularly in this time of year,'' she said, ''is that we conduct an investigation the right way, not in the headlines, not with pressure from people who may have differing views but just do it right -- methodically, carefully, without commenting on it -- and get it done as quickly as possible.''</p>
        <p>Democrats sought to shift the spotlight to the background and possible motives of Mr. Conrad.</p>
        <p>In August 1996, while a federal prosecutor in Charlotte, N.C., Mr. Conrad contributed $250 to Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican, Federal Election Commission reports show. Democrats said the contribution raised questions about Mr. Conrad's political motives in his inquiry.</p>
        <p>In interviews today, several senior Justice Department officials defended Mr. Conrad's impartiality and said there was no basis to believe that his legal judgments were politically motivated.</p>
