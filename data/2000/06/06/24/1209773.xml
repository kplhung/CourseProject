        <p>Investigators at the National Transportation Safety Board writing a report about the crash that killed John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and his sister-in-law last summer have not found a mechanical problem with his plane, but the staff has yet to reach a conclusion about the crash, according to people at the agency.</p>
        <p>Because it was a private plane, Mr. Kennedy's Piper Saratoga did not carry a flight data recorder or a cockpit voice recorder, depriving investigators of the kind of detailed information that is usually available in the crash of an airliner.</p>
        <p>In the crash of private planes, investigators look for engine failure, structural failure or other mechanical or electrical problem. If they fail to find any, they usually give a ''probable cause'' that stems from  some failure by the pilot specific to the accident, like not flying high enough to clear the trees. While airline crashes are sometimes attributed to ''pilot error,'' those by private planes commonly are not.</p>
        <p>In the case of Mr. Kennedy, whose plane went down on a hazy night on its way from New York to Martha's Vineyard, conditions in which a pilot could lose sight of the horizon, their suspicion is a loss of orientation.</p>
        <p>But Ted Lopatkiewicz, a spokesman for the safety board, said today that although a preliminary report had been sent to the board's headquarters here from its regional office in Parsippany, N.J., the report was not final and did not reach a conclusion. That, he said, was for headquarters staff or the board itself.</p>
        <p>The five-member board votes on statements of probable cause on nearly all airline accidents, but on only about two dozen of the roughly 2,000 general aviation crashes each year. For the others, a senior staff member signs the report.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lopatkiewicz said that a report would probably be published next month, but that the board had not decided whether it would vote on the findings.</p>
        <p>The crash last July 16 killed Mr. Kennedy, 38, who was at the controls of his single-engine plane; his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33; and her sister, Lauren G. Bessette, 34.</p>
