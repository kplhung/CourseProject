        <p>Students in New York City performed only slightly better on a citywide mathematics test this year than last, with 68 percent still failing to meet tough new standards.</p>
        <p>The increase of one percentage point for third, fifth, sixth and seventh graders came in a year when those same students saw their reading scores jump sharply, by more than five percentage points. On a statewide test, New York City fourth graders saw their scores jump by nine percentage points.</p>
        <p>The contrast between the reading and math scores put Board of Education officials on the defensive yesterday as they quietly released the figures showing the barely perceptible math gains. They said that the new statewide math standards required students to master more concepts than the new reading standards.</p>
        <p>Testing experts said that elementary school teachers tend to be better trained in reading instruction than math instruction, so their students are slower to improve in math. About 41 percent of New York City students passed the citywide reading test this year, compared with the 32 percent who passed the math test.</p>
        <p>The experts also pointed out that the Board of Education has directed schools to focus on teaching literacy skills in recent years, pouring enormous amounts of money into intensive reading programs in the early grades. It would make sense, then, that students would improve more slowly in math, they said.</p>
        <p>But board officials and others familiar with standardized testing also warned against reading too much into a one-year change in performance on either the reading or the math test. It would be far more instructive to look at student performance on the tests over four or five years, one testing expert said.</p>
        <p>''It's extremely hard to tell what these differences represent,'' said Walter Haney, a senior research associate at the Center for the Study of Testing, Evaluation and Educational Policy at Boston College. ''You can't make inferences about teaching and learning based on one year's performance alone.''</p>
        <p>Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy, who spoke at length with reporters about the improved state and city reading scores earlier this month, chose not to hold a news conference about the scores yesterday.</p>
        <p>''The level of competence in mathematics nationally has long been troublesome,'' Mr. Levy said in a brief written statement. ''New York City is no exception. While today's scores show small increases in most schools, the overall results are disappointing.''</p>
        <p>This year, for the first time, New York City adopted the state's method of scoring and reporting standardized test scores, so that scores on city tests could be easily compared with those on state tests. The scoring is now based on whether students achieve proficiency in the skills demanded by the new state and city learning standards, instead of on how city students compare with a fluctuating national average.</p>
        <p>Scores on the test, which students took in May, were grouped into four levels. Students whose scores were in Levels 3 and 4 performed at or above the state standards, while those in Levels 1 and 2 failed to meet the standards or, worse, demonstrated no evidence of proficiency.</p>
        <p>The best news was that roughly 7,000 fewer students scored in Level 1 in 2000 than in 1999. The percentage of students scoring in that lowest level dropped to 30.8 percent, from 33.9 percent last year.</p>
        <p>While all of the city's 32 community school districts posted gains on the citywide reading test this year, only 24 of those districts saw their math scores improve. District 32 in Bushwick, Brooklyn, showed the most improvement, with the number of students who met the standards increasing by 2.8 percentage points. Still, 72 percent of the students in Bushwick, one of the city's poorest neighborhoods, failed to meet the math standards.</p>
        <p>District 17 in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, showed the steepest decline in math scores -- 2.3 percentage points. Only 23.9 percent of students there met the standards this year. Even in Manhattan's District 2, which consistently has some of the city's highest test scores, only 61.2 percent of students met the math standards this year, up from 60.6 percent in 1999.</p>
        <p>The most impressive gains were among this year's fifth graders, whose average math score was seven points higher than that of the fifth graders who took the test in 1999. Curiously, though, this year's fifth graders were the only age group whose reading scores were actually lower, compared with those who took the test in 1999.</p>
        <p>Robert Tobias, the board's director of assessment, said that anomaly had been intriguing enough to merit a closer look. His research found that this year's fifth graders had similar test results when they were in fourth grade, suggesting that as a group, ''they have very strong math skills but much weaker reading skills.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Tobias was at a loss to explain the discrepancy.</p>
        <p>The average score of seventh graders was four points higher than that of last year's seventh-grade class. But the average scores for third and sixth graders fell, by 1.3 points for third graders and 1.5 points for sixth graders.</p>
        <p>Board of Education officials would not provide examples of questions on the math test. But they said the hourlong, multiple-choice test measured children's ability to add, subtract, multiply and divide, and to understand statistics and probability. Seventh graders were also tested on some algebra and geometry concepts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tobias said students had not improved as significantly in math as in reading this year because the learning curve for the new math standards was steeper.</p>
        <p>''The nature of mathematics is such that when you raise standards, kids have to learn a lot of new skills,'' he said. ''Whereas when you raise standards in reading they have to deal with more sophisticated material, but the skills are relatively the same.''</p>
        <p>Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers, was among those who speculated that reading scores had improved more sharply because the system had poured more money and resources into reading instruction.</p>
        <p>''Given the relentless focus we've made on literacy in recent years, it's not surprising that math instruction has received less attention,'' she said. ''But the progress that we're starting to achieve in reading gives us a road map for what we need to improve math instruction.''</p>
        <p>But Monty Neill, executive director of FairTest, a private organization opposed to standardized testing, said the remarkable jump in reading scores did not necessarily mean that children were actually reading and writing at higher levels. Instead, he said, it could mean that schools were spending more time in drilling students for tests.</p>
