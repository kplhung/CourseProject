        <p>Tomorrow marks the 50th anniversary of the start of the Korean War. As all schoolchildren in North Korea know, the war began when South Korea invaded its peaceful neighbor to the north. Since then the government in Seoul has remained enslaved to a clique of generals, spies and capitalists who are puppets of the United States.</p>
        <p>Old attitudes die hard, as is obvious from the twisted propaganda along these lines that keeps flowing from Pyongyang even after the extraordinary meeting between leaders of the North and South last week. A visitor who met with President Kim Dae Jung in Seoul after the meeting says that despite all the euphoria in his country, the South Korean president cautions that it will take decades, perhaps generations, to achieve reunification.</p>
        <p>Still, anyone following recent events on the Korean Peninsula cannot help but find them amazing.</p>
        <p>On one side is President Kim of South Korea, a former dissident once rescued from a ship -- where he was about to be tossed overboard wrapped in heavy chains by government goons -- only after intervention by the United States.</p>
        <p>On the other is Kim Jong Il of the North, often described as a murderous megalomaniac surrounded by concubines. Among other things, in the course of his despotic career he is said to have ordered the blowing up of a civilian airliner, a bombing attack on the South Korean Cabinet and the kidnapping of a movie star and director who were forced to help build up the North Korean film industry. No wonder that The Economist features the oddly coiffed and reclusive Mr. Kim on its cover with the caption ''Greetings, Earthlings.''</p>
        <p>The handful of Western visitors who have been in North Korea all liken it to another planet. When I was in Pyongyang in 1991, revolutionary slogans were everywhere, and loudspeakers at construction sites exhorted workers with picks and shovels to toil for the glory of the state. The 105-story hotel then under construction, proudly described as the tallest hotel in the world, was already sagging visibly. It still has not opened. Everyone I met recited slogans about North Korea as paradise on earth. Some admitted to meat shortages, but not to the truth of reports of starvation in the countryside.</p>
        <p>Even if reconciliation remains a distant dream, the significance of the two Mr. Kims meeting is tremendous. It shakes the equation in East Asia and could even alter the political scene in the United States. For one thing, the meeting puts South Korea in an unaccustomed place -- the driver's seat of the policies being worked out to deal with the danger posed by the North.</p>
        <p>For years the United States has taken the lead in negotiating with North Korea, offering a combination of threats and incentives to get it to stop building nuclear weapons. Now after negotiating a deal on nuclear and missile restraint with Pyongyang, the Clinton administration must defend its approach against charges of naivete by hawkish Republicans, including advisers to Gov. George W. Bush.</p>
        <p>The meeting of the two Korean leaders is unlikely to soften their criticism. Indeed, some Republicans talk of ''taking out'' the North Korean nuclear installations. But they overlook the reality that, aside from the difficulty of destroying facilities hundreds of feet below ground, any such attempt would lead to the destruction of Seoul with a barrage of mortar, artillery and poison gas counterattacks.</p>
        <p>In years past, the United States has served as a brake on confrontation-minded generals in Seoul. Today, with hawkish Americans calling for a tough stance toward North Korea and plans for an antimissile defense system, South Korea may be the one arguing for military restraint and political engagement.</p>
        <p>In regional terms, the irony is that for all the yearning for reunification of the Korean Peninsula, almost no one close to the situation wants it to happen anytime soon. The South Koreans fear that a rapid absorption of the North will wreck their economy in the way Germany was weakened when it was reunified a decade ago. Russia, China and Japan -- which for centuries jockeyed for supremacy on the peninsula -- are hardly enthusiastic today about the possibility of a newly powerful rival in the neighborhood. Many American experts have no such concerns but nonetheless fear the day -- regarded by some experts as inevitable -- that Koreans ask for the United States to withdraw its troops.</p>
        <p>Why has North Korea decided to reach out to the people it still regards as implacable foes? The answers lie in the overwhelming economic incentives and in apparent pressure from China to defuse the situation in hopes of speeding the withdrawal of the American presence. President Kim of South Korea has also done a masterly job of assuring the North that he really does not want to absorb it or destroy its system.</p>
        <p>Finally, it appears that the unpredictable Mr. Kim of the North may be looking for legitimacy. Few doubt that North Korea remains capable of a clandestine nuclear program, missile exports or other dangerous behavior. Yet the North may be willing to keep its aggressive impulses in check in return for help from its wary adversaries. As for South Korea, for now it has taken the lead, and the rest of the world will have to respond. Who knows? The latest in North Korean movies may soon be on their way to the outside world.</p>
