        <p>In the crucial minutes after a radiation leak, emergency workers at the Indian Point 2 nuclear power plant were hampered by equipment failures, inadequate training and a general disorderliness that could have been prevented, according to a recent memorandum from the plant's owner, Consolidated Edison.</p>
        <p>In blunt language, the company's internal memo outlined a series of mishaps that involved malfunctioning telephones and pagers and an emergency data system that could not be brought online for five hours. In addition, several workers were unsure how to respond and did not report to their stations until more than two hours later.</p>
        <p>The memo also suggested that Con Edison officials had known about these problems for at least six months before the leak, but did not act promptly to fix them. ''Actions to correct these conditions had been identified, scheduled and initiated prior to the event, but had not been fully implemented,'' it reported.</p>
        <p>Con Edison's own assessment of its emergency response provides the most critical look yet of the events surrounding the Feb. 15 leak at the Indian Point 2 plant in Buchanan, N.Y. A tiny amount of radioactive steam escaped after a tube carrying superheated radioactive water cracked from corrosion, and the plant was shut down. No injuries were reported, but the accident was the worst in the 26-year history of the plant, which is about 35 miles north of New York City.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission will hold a public meeting at the Cortlandt Town Hall to discuss safety and operational issues at Indian Point 2. An April inspection report by the regulatory commission provided far less detail about Con Edison's problems.</p>
        <p>D. Joy Faber, a spokeswoman for Con Edison, would not answer specific questions today about the company's memo and instead faxed a written statement to The New York Times.</p>
        <p>''We have learned a lot from our own review of the events of Feb. 15 and have already made improvements,'' the statement read. ''We must stress, however, that every review confirmed that there was no danger to the public or our employees, and that our response to the event was prompt and appropriate.''</p>
        <p>The five-page memo, which was first reported on Wednesday by The Journal News in Westchester County, was posted electronically on a database for nuclear power plants. Its cautionary tone and minute-by-minute breakdown of the emergency response seemed intended to prevent similar problems at other power plants.</p>
        <p>But the memo has been cited by a number of Westchester County officials and advocacy groups who have criticized Con Edison over its handling of the accident. They have accused the company of slipshod inspections that missed the cracked tube in the plant's steam generator, and of not immediately notifying residents about the leak.</p>
        <p>''I think this shows that Con Edison is not being as upfront with the public and the N.R.C. as they are with other nuclear reactors,'' said Mark Jacobs, director of the Westchester People's Action Coalition, an environmental group in White Plains. ''Time and time again, they say, 'We put safety first,' and we find out this is not the case.''</p>
        <p>Con Edison has applied to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to resume operations at Indian Point 2 this summer, but many local officials have demanded that the company first take extra safeguards like replacing the plant's aging steam generators. No decision has been made yet.</p>
        <p>Diane Screnci, a spokeswoman for the regulatory commission, said the Con Edison memo would not be a factor in its decision. ''There isn't anything new,'' she said. ''In substance, everything in that memo was in our report.''</p>
        <p>In addition, Ms. Screnci said, Con Edison demonstrated that those earlier problems had been corrected during an emergency drill at the nuclear plant on June 1.</p>
        <p>But several critics said today that the company's memo cast new doubts not just on the safety of Indian Point 2, but also on the regulatory commission's oversight of the nuclear plant.</p>
        <p>''The N.R.C. report was very stylized and didn't really give a candid view of what happened,'' said Edward Smeloff, executive director of the Pace University Energy Project. ''This internal memo drew a picture that was much more haphazard. A lot went wrong. It's not a pretty picture.''</p>
