        <p>Re ''Outrage in an Illinois Town Over Justices' Ruling on Prayer'' (news article, June 22):</p>
        <p>As an atheist who took part in school plays in high school, I understand feelings of coercion. Our teacher would have the cast join in a group prayer before the show. To join in the circle was offensive to me, but to stand outside it was to be ostracized.</p>
        <p>One of the parents in your article complained, ''If people are bothered by a bunch of kids getting together to pray before a game, well, I just don't understand.'' But they are not getting together in a group to pray; they are broadcasting a prayer to everyone, whether they want to hear it or not.</p>
