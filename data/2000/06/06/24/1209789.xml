        <p>In the current debate over the death penalty, the focus has been largely on the states, primarily Illinois, whose governor has declared a moratorium, and Texas, which puts more inmates to death than most countries and whose governor, of course, is running for president.</p>
        <p>This has allowed the Clinton administration to remain largely above the fray because there has not been a federal execution in nearly 40 years. Although Vice President Al Gore favors the death penalty, he has not faced the tough questioning that Gov. George W. Bush has, and Mr. Gore has said little other than that he does not see the need for a federal moratorium.</p>

        <p>In the current debate over the death penalty, the focus has been largely on the states, primarily Illinois, whose governor has declared a moratorium, and Texas, which puts more inmates to death than most countries and whose governor, of course, is running for president.</p>
        <p>This has allowed the Clinton administration to remain largely above the fray because there has not been a federal execution in nearly 40 years. Although Vice President Al Gore favors the death penalty, he has not faced the tough questioning that Gov. George W. Bush has, and Mr. Gore has said little other than that he does not see the need for a federal moratorium.</p>
        <p>But the case of a condemned migrant worker may soon call attention to the federal capital punishment system.</p>
        <p>Juan Raul Garza, a migrant farm worker and high school dropout who was convicted seven years ago of marijuana smuggling and three drug-related murders in Brownsville, Tex., is scheduled to be executed on Aug. 5. It would be the first federal execution since John F. Kennedy was president, when a man was put to death by hanging in Iowa for kidnapping and murder.</p>
        <p>The Garza case raises broad and, for many, troubling issues about the application of the federal death penalty, most specifically, whether race and geography determine who is sentenced to die at the hands of the United States government.</p>
        <p>Seventeen of the 21 federal prisoners facing the death penalty are members of minorities, and federal prosecutors in a dozen Southern states have accounted for more than half of the federal cases in which the death penalty has been sought.</p>
        <p>Mr. Garza's lawyers have exhausted their legal appeals and are turning to the court of public opinion and politics. They have enlisted the American Bar Association, which in a highly unusual move last month, called on President Clinton to declare a moratorium on federal executions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Garza wants to ask the president for clemency. But his lawyers said they are facing some formidable handicaps.</p>
        <p>Although the Constitution gives presidents absolute authority to grant clemency and presidents could do so on their own at any time, they rarely do.</p>
        <p>And while the procedure for seeking clemency in noncapital cases is clear, the procedures in capital cases are still being drafted, Mr. Clinton said in February.</p>
        <p>The absence of clear guidelines, Mr. Garza's lawyers believe, severely hampers their ability to make an effective case for clemency.</p>
        <p>''We're really between a rock and a hard place,'' said Gregory Wiercioch, a lawyer with the Texas Defender Service, who has been representing Mr. Garza in his appeals. ''A lot of the information we want to put in the petition, we don't have. It's in the hands of the government.''</p>
        <p>This included a government study on whether race is a factor in applying the death penalty in federal cases. The Justice Department has turned down Mr. Garza's request for the study or the raw data that the department has gathered. A department spokesman said the study had not been completed and the data would not be made public.</p>
        <p>Mr. Garza's lawyers have also requested information on how the Justice Department has handled other capital cases. There are a dozen cases like Mr. Garza's -- multiple drug-related murders -- in which federal prosecutors did not seek the death penalty, including six in New York, Mr. Wiercioch said.</p>
        <p>He wants to know why the death penalty was sought in Mr. Garza's case, and he believes race was a factor. Of the 27 defendants against whom the Bush administration sought the death penalty for drug-related killings, including Mr. Garza who was convicted after Mr. Bush left office, 23 were African-American or Hispanic, Mr. Wiercioch said.</p>
        <p>In 1994, when Congress was considering sweeping death penalty legislation, Attorney General Janet Reno said in a letter to a congressman who opposed the death penalty that the department was developing procedures that would allow for the disclosure of its capital prosecution decisions ''so that the public can review and understand the basis for such decisions.''</p>
        <p>A Justice Department official said this week that the procedures had not yet been adopted.</p>
        <p>After the Supreme Court declared in 1972 that the death penalty, as it was then being applied, was unconstitutional, states quickly adopted laws that the court upheld. But Congress spent the next 16 years struggling to find a way around the court's concerns. In 1988, Congress adopted what has become known as the ''drug kingpin statute,'' which allows for the death penalty against an individual who commits murder as part of a larger drug enterprise.</p>
        <p>Six years later, in 1994, Congress enacted the Federal Death Penalty Act, which expanded the crimes for which a defendant could be executed. They included the assassination of the president, large-scale drug trafficking even when no one is killed,  drive-by killings, sexual abuse resulting in death and destruction of a plane, train or motor vehicle resulting in death.</p>
        <p>Federal law requires the appointment of two lawyers for an indigent defendant facing the death penalty, at least one of whom must be experienced in capital cases. As a result, claims of ineffective assistance of counsel do not mark the federal system, as they do many states, such as Texas, where defendants have been represented by lawyers who have slept through trials or have otherwise displayed gross incompetence.</p>
        <p>The principal concerns about the federal death penalty are whether it is being applied fairly and uniformly.</p>
        <p>Since 1988, the Justice Department has allowed the death penalty to be sought against 199 defendants, according to the Federal Death Penalty Resource Counsel in Columbia, S.C.. Seventy-six percent of those defendants are minorities, and 52 percent are African-Americans.</p>
        <p>Of the 21 federal inmates currently facing execution -- including Timothy J. McVeigh, who was convicted in the Oklahoma City bombings -- about 62 percent, or 13, are African-Americans. This is a greater percentage of blacks on death row than in all but four states: Maryland, Louisiana, Illinois and Pennsylvania. In Texas, by contrast, 41 percent of the death row population is black, and in Alabama, 46 percent, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, a private organization in Washington that opposes the death penalty.</p>
        <p>''If some back county in the South had the same kind of numbers, the Department of Justice would be down here investigating, handing out indictments,'' Mr. Wiercioch said.</p>
        <p>In an interview last week, Mr.  Gore said, ''The question of racial disparity is right now being investigated thoroughly within the Justice Department.''</p>
        <p>He added that the factors that led Columbia University researchers to raise questions about the death penalty in a recent study, like prosecutorial misconduct and incompetent defense counsel, ''are the kinds of mistakes that could conceivably have a connection to racial attitudes in the aggregate.''</p>
        <p>In his letter to Mr. Clinton on May 2 calling for a federal moratorium, the president of the American Bar Association, William G. Paul of Oklahoma City, urged a ''comprehensive examination of the federal death penalty that would not be limited to the question of racial discrimination.'' The bar association has not taken a position for or against the death penalty.</p>
        <p>There are glaring geographic disparities in the application of the federal death penalty law.</p>
        <p>Fourteen of the 21 defendants on federal death row, in Terre Haute, Ind., are from three states -- Texas, 6; Virginia, 4, and Missouri, 4.</p>
        <p>Under a system put in place by Ms. Reno, United States attorneys who file charges in which the death penalty is a possibility are required to send a memorandum to the Justice Department for review by a four-member committee, the Capital Case Review Committee. The system is intended to ensure uniformity and fairness in the application of the death penalty.</p>
        <p>Yet, from 1994 to 1999, one-third of the United States attorney's offices did not file a capital prosecution request, a former member of the review committee, Rory K. Little, wrote in an article in the Fordham Urban Law Journal in March 1999.</p>
        <p>Mr. Little noted that federal prosecutors have considerable discretion but he said this suggested that the federal death penalty was not being applied uniformly.</p>
        <p>''It is difficult to believe that not a single murder in those 11 states since 1994 was a possible candidate for federal prosecution,'' Mr. Little wrote in the article, ''The Federal Death Penalty: History and Some Thoughts About the Department of Justice's Role.'' He went on: ''There are, sadly, gang-related killings in every urban center in America, and drug-related killings occur not only in Miami, but also in urban centers such as New York, San Francisco, Chicago and Seattle.''</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview, Mr. Little, a former federal prosecutor who is now a professor of criminal law and legal ethics at Hastings College of Law in San Francisco, said he was not an ''emotional opponent'' of the death penalty, but that he had ''grave misgivings'' about the way it is administered by the states.</p>
        <p>On the federal level, he said, further study was needed before a judgment could be made. He added: ''In my view, it isn't fair that if somebody who commits a bank robbery and a guard dies is going to get the death penalty if it happened in Texas, but someone who does the same thing in Massachusetts isn't.''</p>
        <p>He said he was aware of a case in Missouri that was very similar to Mr. Garza's in which the government did not seek the death penalty.</p>
        <p>Mr. Garza was accused of being a major drug dealer and convicted of smuggling more than 1,000 kilos of marijuana from Mexico between 1982 and 1992, as well as of three murders.</p>
        <p>At the punishment phase of Mr. Garza's trial, prosecutors introduced testimony that Mr. Garza committed four murders in Mexico. But he has never been prosecuted for the murders.</p>
        <p>''In the history of the modern death penalty, we are unaware of any case where prosecutors introduce evidence of unadjudicated foreign crimes at the penalty phase,'' said Bruce W. Gilchrist, a lawyer  with Hogan &amp; Hartson, who has joined Mr. Garza's defense team pro bono.</p>
        <p>Federal courts have rejected the claim that the testimony violated Mr. Garza's constitutional protections. But the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, a body of the Organization of American States, is investigating whether it violated the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man, which the United States has signed.</p>
        <p>Pending the outcome of that investigation, the organization has called on the Clinton administration to delay Mr. Garza's execution.</p>
        <p>In February, Senator Russell D. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, sent a letter to the president and Ms. Reno asking them to suspend federal executions, and he has introduced legislation calling for a national moratorium on the death penalty.</p>
