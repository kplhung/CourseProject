        <p>Energizer Holdings Inc., the nation's No. 2 maker of alkaline batteries, said yesterday it had begun selling a line of premium-priced batteries for high-tech devices in an attempt to take sales from the Gillette Company's top-selling Duracell brand. Energizer, based in St. Louis, plans to spend $100 million in the next year on a global marketing campaign as it introduces the Energizer e2, company officials said. A package of 4 AA batteries will sell for about $4.59, or about a third more than its main brand. Energizer, spun off by the Ralston Purina Company in April, has been losing market share to Duracell in the last five years.</p>
