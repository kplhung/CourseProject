        <p>An entry in the Addenda listing on the Media Business page on Monday about a study released by Time Inc. on pharmaceutical ads misstated the percentage of consumers who said they had been deterred from taking a drug by information provided about side effects. Of the respondents who saw medication ads on television and said they would avoid a particular drug as a result, 61 percent said the reason was information on side effects. Of those who saw medication ads in magazines and said they would do so, 38 percent attributed their reluctance to information on side effects.</p>
