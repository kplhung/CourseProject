        <p>Sitting before a group of fans yesterday at the NBA Store on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, Erick Barkley was relaxed. The troubles of the National Collegiate Athletic Association were behind him and so was a grueling week of workouts, flying from one city to another, finishing with a session with the Knicks yesterday.</p>
        <p>Barkley gave up his final two years at St. John's to enter the National Basketball Association draft next Wednesday. The possibility of an early entry had been talked about ever since he arrived at St. John's. He was a point guard with the talent to go to the next level. But the move was accelerated by an investigation that blighted his sophomore season, with the N.C.A.A. suspending him twice while it searched into his relationship with Andy Miller, who he has now signed as his agent.</p>

        <p>Barkley gave up his final two years at St. John's to enter the National Basketball Association draft next Wednesday.

        <p>''I got over that, the whole N.C.A.A. thing,'' Barkley said. ''I didn't take that as a problem. I turned 22 years old this year and I was already thinking about turning pro anyway. The N.C.A.A., they just made my decision a lot easier. But I feel happy, excited, a little bit nervous.''</p>
