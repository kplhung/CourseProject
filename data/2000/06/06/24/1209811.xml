        <p>Following are excerpts from Vice President Al Gore's April 18 interview with the F.B.I. about political fund-raising during the 1996 presidential campaign. Among other topics, Mr. Gore discussed a trip to Taiwan, the purpose of invitations to coffee at the White House and a visit to a Buddhist temple. At one point his lawyer, James F. Neal, joined the discussion. The transcript was released by the Gore campaign.</p>
        <p>Q.: So, as I understand it, your motivation for going on the trip was both to do a favor for the D.S.C.C. and to cultivate a relationship with a group of people that you were going overseas with?</p>
        <p>A.: That's correct.  Q.: Was there any other motivation for it?  A.: Just that I had never been to Taiwan, and I wouldn't have gone under those circumstances and for such a short -- you know, the long walk for a short drink of water. I would have done it in a different way. But that was an extra, small factor in going. . . .  Q.: Did you visit the Fo Kuang Shan Temple?  A.: Yes. That was in Kaohsiung. We flew down to the second city of Taiwan principally for that reason.  Q.: Did you meet the Master Hsing Yun at that time?  A.: I did.  Q.: Describe what you recall about your conversations with him.  A.: I was quite favorably impressed by him. He described the work of the Temple. He placed a lot of emphasis on the work they did in reaching out to the poor and disadvantaged in the surrounding area where the thing was located. He was very proud of an exhibit that they did that depicted different religious stories in Buddhism in a kind of a diorama-type way, life-size sculpted figures. I don't know that they were made out of, but it was this sort of tableaus, one after the other.</p>
        <p>The most significant part of it was the conversation with him, which was mainly about, as I recall it anyway, theological issues. Having been a student at the graduate school of religion at Vanderbilt, I was asking him a lot of questions about aspects of his faith that I knew nothing about. And it was quite an interesting conversation and made an impression on me.</p>
        <p>I had a very positive impression of him as a person, and I felt that his underlying basic motivations were very positive and impressive. He seemed like a pastor would -- I mean, a good pastor would be in my faith tradition, and seemed to have a genuine, a quite genuine feeling of compassion for the people that they were reaching out to, feeding, clothing, etc.  Q.: Was there discussion about the Hsi Lai Temple in the United States or his faith's presence in the United States?  A.: Yes. Yes, he told me toward, I think it was toward the end of the conversations that he had constructed the largest Buddhist temple in North America and that it was in Los Angeles and that he would love for me to visit there sometime. And I said, well, if I ever have the opportunity, perhaps I can. And that was the extent of it. . . .  Q.: What was the purpose of the coffees?  A.: Well, they were for the president to meet with people who were interested in supporting his policies and his politics. But that was more or less on his side of the house, and I'm not the best source of information on that.  Q.: In terms of a fund-raising tool, what was the purpose of the coffees?  A.: I don't know. They were on his side of the house. And I will give you my understanding of what I thought they were. I thought they were events that allowed the president to spend time with influential people who wanted to talk about policy, who would at some later time possibly be asked to financially support the D.N.C. It was certainly not my understanding that they were fund-raising events.  Q.: Did you have any understanding, or do you have any understanding that there was a price tag associated with the coffees?  A.: No, I do not and did not.  Q.: With respect to raising the $108 million [a goal mentioned in a White House memo on fund-raising], did you have discussions with anybody concerning the role coffees would play in raising that type of money?  A.: Well, let me define the term ''raising,'' if I could, because if you mean by it, would they be events at which money was raised, the answer is no. But it is, it was then and has for a long time been common practice to have meetings with people who are interested in various subjects, spend time with them, cultivate the relationship, show them the respect that the time signifies, and then, on the basis of the relationship that is built up then and in other ways, ask them to support the D.N.C., or, if you're in the Senate or the House, your campaign fund.</p>
        <p>But often it is assumed that you're going to have a hard time asking somebody to be a contributor if you have never met the person, spent time with the person, or had an opportunity to hear the person's views.</p>
        <p>The coffees, as I understood them, were opportunities for the president to reach out to a larger number of people, spend time with them, hear their views, respond to questions, etc. and in that way build more  relationships, some of which later on would be the basis for campaign solicitations from the D.N.C.  Q.: When I use the term ''coffee,'' in terms of raising the amount necessary for the D.N.C. to succeed, I don't mean it in terms of money being contributed at the event. I mean it in terms of the coffee being a tool by which those funds are raised.  A.: Well, it's the same definitional. I mean, they are, they were what they were. They were sessions for the exchange of ideas, during which, it was my understanding, that the president would cultivate a closer relationship with the individuals who were there. It was contemplated at the time when they were set up that some or many of those who participated in those sessions would later on be likely to be asked to contribute; but that this was a part of relationship-building, and the relationship-building, in turn, had an impact on the likelihood that they would become donors later on. . . .</p>
        <p>Q.: Did you have any conversation with the president about the income-generating function of the coffee?  A.: No, not per se. Just in the way that I have described it to you previously. I attended meetings where the assumption was that the relationships built at these coffees would be such that some of those who attended would be more likely to be receptive at a later time, if they were solicited by the D.N.C. . . .  Q.: Have you had a conversation with anybody about the cost to attend a White House coffee?  A.: No. No, I ---- it is not my ---- it is my certain belief that I never heard anyone say that a particular amount of money was attached to attendance -- a particular amount of money that would later be anticipated to be raised by the D.N.C. was attached to attendance at these events. I never heard anything remotely similar to that, and I would be very surprised if any such reference was made.  Q.: You are not familiar with the cost of $50,000 being the cost to attend the fund-raiser?  A.: Absolutely not. Absolutely not. And it is my belief that that would have been considered wildly inappropriate, if not worse, by those who talked about those coffees. They not were considered in that way.</p>
        <p>Now, there was, as I've said before, an anticipation that the relationships built during these sessions might make some of those people more conducive to making financial contributions when they were solicited at a later time.</p>
        <p>But I would be shocked if any of my colleagues who participated in the meetings I was at, or any other meetings at the White House that I was not at, thought of those coffees in that way. . . .  Q.: There's an interesting book about your life on the bookshelves these days called ''Inventing Al Gore,'' by an author named Bill Turque. Are you familiar with that work?  A.: I haven't read it, but I'm certainly familiar with it.  Q.: In that book, that author indicates that you had attended 23 White House coffees and joined the president at 8. Would that be an accurate statement.  A.: I don't know.  Q.: But certainly more than one?  A.: I wouldn't necessarily take him as a source.  Q.: I'm not taking him as a source. What I'm saying is, would that perhaps refresh your recollection as to the number of coffees that you attended?  A.: That seems inaccurate to me. Far from the only inaccurate thing that has been quoted to to me from that particular book. But yes, that seems, that seems inaccurate to me.  Q.: He refers to you as earning the reputation as solicitor-in-chief. Have you ever heard that title before?  A.: I heard that title for the first time in a newspaper article by Bob Woodward, and it struck me as quite odd when he put that in the newspaper article, because I had never heard it prior to that time. I believe it to be completely unfair and inaccurate.  Q.: Do you believe it to be related in any way to the White House coffees?  A.: Oh, I know it's completely unrelated to the White House coffees. . . .  Q.: Well, let me turn your attention to the Hsi Lai Temple.  A.: All right.  Q.: Before I do, I wanted to read you a couple of comments that you have made publicly with respect to that event. On Oct. 22, 1996, you told NPR's Nina Totenberg that you thought that event was a ''community outreach.'' Then on Jan. 14, you told NBC's  Katie Couric that you did not know it was a fund-raiser, but, but ''I knew it was a political event and I knew that finance people were going to be present.'' Having said those two fairly different things, knowing that you're under oath today, can you tell me what you knew about the Hsi Lai Temple event and when you knew it?  A.: Yes, I'll be glad to. At the time I went there I felt that it was a visit that was arranged pursuant to the desire I had expressed in the meeting with Hsing Yun to visit his temple. I knew that the individuals who were his followers included Maria Hsia and John Huang. I felt that this visit was something they would be very pleased with because it showed honor to their community and to their place of worship, and that it was a source of community pride to them.</p>
        <p>I knew when I arrived that the community was expressing exactly that pride with, for example, a marching band on the steps of the temple from a local school. I met elected officials, including officials from the other political party, Republicans. I met neighborhood leaders from the surrounding neighborhood, including those who were beneficiaries of the charitable contributions and charitable work performed by the temple.</p>
        <p>That rang true to me because I had seen the work they had done, that they did on a regular basis, in the place that I had visited in Taiwan.</p>
        <p>There was no solicitation of money. I did not see any money or checks change hands. I never heard it discussed. Nor do I believe it took place, incidentally. Perhaps you know that some money changed hands there. But to this day, I don't think any did. . . .</p>
        <p>Q.: When you told Katie Couric that you did not know it was a fund-raiser but you knew it was a political event, what did you mean by the term ''political event.''</p>
        <p>A.: It was an outreach to a politically active  community in a political campaign year.  . . .  Q.: Mary McGrory calls you the best-briefed man in Washington. Did you have conversations with any of your staff concerning this event prior to leaving to attend the event?  A.: I don't recall any.  Q.: When is the first time you recall any communication to you concerning attending an event at the Hsi Lai Temple on April 29?  A.: Could you repeat that question?  Q.: Sure. Maybe I can phrase it in a better way. When do you first recall having any conversation to do with attending the temple on April 29, with anyone on your staff or anyone else? When is ----  A.: When Hsing Yun was there in my White House office.  Q.: O.K. When is the next time you had a conversation with any person concerning going to the temple?  A.: I don't know. I don't know.  Q.: Do you recall having any conversations with anybody about attending on that --  A.: I sure as hell don't recall having ---- I sure as hell did not have any conversations with anyone saying, this is a fund-raising event. As to whether or not I had any follow-up conversations that said, were we able to set up this event or not, I don't think I did. But I may have. The reason I don't think I did is because I recall the feeling I had, when I looked at the briefing book, and saw, oh, great, I'm going to be able to go see this, this temple. . . .  Q.: Do you know when you were first informed of problems related to the Temple visit?  A.: No, I don't, but I believe that it was the day when I first found out that, that it was  fund-raiser and that it was -- that it had become public and that the D.N.C. was embarrassed by having done this and that they were sending back the contributions. I had a conversation with -- I was on my plane, still on the campaign trail, and I believe David Strauss told me. And I said to him, David, you told me this was a community outreach event. He said, it was. And I gave the interview to Nina Totenberg that you quoted earlier on the plane a few hours after that.  Q.: So, that would have been the date that you first learned --  A.: I believe so. I believe so.  MR. NEAL. -- Well, you said that you learned it was a fund-raiser. I thought you just said --  A.: No; he asked me if it was the first time I learned that they had reimbursed the expenses and the contributors, and I believe that's the first time I learned that.  MR. NEAL. -- Well, I still want to go back. You said you learned it was a fund-raiser.  A.: That was also the first time I learned it was a --  MR. NEAL. -- I thought you said previously you didn't, you still don't know whether it was a fund-raiser.  A.: Well, that's right. That is more accurate. Let me, let me amend that. That was the first time that I learned it was alleged to be, to have been a fund-raiser. And, again, I still do not know that any funds, that any money changed hands there.</p>
