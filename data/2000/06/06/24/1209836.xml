        <p>The building products maker Johns Manville Corporation, which was nearly destroyed in the 1980's by asbestos litigation, agreed yesterday to be sold to an investor group for about $3 billion. The Texas buyout firm Hicks, Muse, Tate &amp; Furst Inc. is teaming up with the merchant banking unit of the Bear Stearns Companies to buy the company. The deal includes $13.625 a share in cash and 13 percent preferred stock worth about $300 million, payable over a term of 12 years. The acquisition, which is expected to close by the end of the year, comes more than one year after Johns Manville put itself on the auction block. Johns Manville is based in Denver with 1999 sales of $2.2 billion.</p>
