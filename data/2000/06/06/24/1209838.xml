        <p>McCormick &amp; Company, the world's largest spice and seasonings maker, said it was in talks to buy the Ducros herb business of Eridania Beghin-Say of France to bolster sales in Europe. McCormick said in a statement that the discussions were at an advanced stage, but the company declined to comment further. Ducros is France's biggest maker of herbs and spices, with about $234 million in sales last year. It owns five plants in France, Albania and Portugal and employs about 930 people. McCormick, which is based in Sparks, Md., has been working to cut costs in Europe to free cash for new products.</p>
