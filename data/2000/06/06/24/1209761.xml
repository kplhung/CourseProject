        <p>SO sanguine is Simon Billenness that he seems not the least bit downcast by this week's United States Supreme Court decision overturning the Massachusetts ''Burma Law,'' which he co-wrote.</p>
        <p>There are, after all, so many other economic tools to use against companies that support the totalitarian regime of Myanmar, formerly Burma. And as a super-specialist in just this kind of battle, using financial pressure to fight foreign oppression, he knows all of them: divestment campaigns, consumer boycotts, shareholder resolutions, the whole gamut.</p>
        <p>Mr. Billenness enumerated them as he sat surrounded by two-foot-high stacks of paper (''Here I am working to topple a military dictatorship, and I have trouble finding things on my desk!'' he lamented in the cheery clip of his native Britain) and books with titles like ''The Anguish of Tibet'' and ''Corporate Crime and Violence.''</p>
        <p>The desk belongs to Trillium Asset Management, a Boston concern that, with $675 million in client money, labels itself the nation's largest and oldest independent investment firm dedicated totally to ''socially responsible'' investment.</p>
        <p>Most of Trillium's employees actually work investing money, but Mr. Billenness, 35, a senior research analyst, has the particular luxury of spending virtually all his time on social advocacy, like figuring out how best to support the democracy movement in Myanmar, whose leaders are accused of torture, forced labor and brutal repression.</p>
        <p>To wit: With nary a pause after the Supreme Court decision, Mr. Billenness and other members of the Free Burma Coalition, a national umbrella group, plan to begin a push this summer to get cities and states to pass new laws penalizing companies that do business with Myanmar, he said.</p>
        <p>The Supreme Court's ruling against the Massachusetts law, which largely barred the state government from doing business with companies that trade with Myanmar, was narrow enough that it left room for states and cities to pass such home-grown foreign policy measures, Mr. Billenness said. Provided, that is, they are not pre-empted by federal law, as the Massachusetts measure was.</p>
        <p>So there is room for a continued local-global campaign that is, not coincidentally, highly reminiscent of the movement to fight South African apartheid using economic means like divestment.</p>
        <p>Here is the Massachusetts link: In 1993, Mr. Billenness, a freshly minted M.B.A. from Boston College, went to watch a news conference about the end of economic sanctions against South Africa. There he met Byron Rushing, a prominent legislator who had written the state's law on anti-apartheid sanctions. And he suggested that Mr. Rushing do something similar for Myanmar.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rushing said he would need more information on the country. Mr. Billenness provided it, including a statement by Nobel Peace Prize laureates calling for sanctions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rushing eventually gave Mr. Billenness a copy of the bill he wrote on South Africa sanctions and asked him to adapt it for Myanmar. So Mr. Billenness went home, he said, ''and typed it out word for word, except that whenever I came to 'South Africa,' I put in 'Burma.' Then I gave it back to him on a disk, and that's how I 'co-authored' the law on Burma.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rushing introduced the bill in 1994, and it passed in 1996. Citing the Massachusetts law, a number of companies pulled out of Myanmar, among them Apple Computers and Hewlett-Packard, Mr. Billenness said. But by 1997, a backlash began as well. There was, he said, ''quite a kerfuffle.''</p>
        <p>The European Commission formally protested, and in 1998, the National Foreign Trade Council, a Washington-based association, brought suit. The law's opponents said it violated international trade agreements and interfered with the federal government's function of making foreign policy. They won in federal court. And now again in the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>Why was the Myanmar law challenged, while the South Africa laws never were? The economy has become so globalized, Mr. Billenness said, that more than ever, ''if you pass a selective purchasing law in any city in the world, it will have import far beyond its borders.''</p>
        <p>That brought trouble for the Massachusetts law, but ''it shows how we as consumers, as investors, can use our freedom in the marketplace to effect political and social change.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Billenness said he believed ''the battle has been more important than the result'' in that the Massachusetts law helped bring talk about Myanmar to the forefront. Seventy-eight members of Congress expressed support for the law, as did 22 state attorneys general.</p>
        <p>The movement is growing, as reflected in the thousands of names on his e-mail lists, all collected over the last few years.</p>
        <p>M R. BILLENNESS himself came to the ''Free Burma'' cause in a rather researched, though by no means cold-hearted, way. A native Londoner, he is the second son of parents who met at a Young Liberals conference and who both remain very active in Britain's Liberal Party. He became actively Liberal himself by the age of 14, even resuscitating a local Young Liberals chapter.</p>
        <p>When he finished Loughborough University in 1985, he married an American -- he has since divorced -- came to the United States and began working in finance from the ground up, as a bank teller. He quickly overcame his initial confusion between the American dime and the nickel, he said.</p>
        <p>He gravitated toward ''socially responsible'' investing (to this day, he has a Working Assets Visa card -- ''plastic with purpose'' that contributes a percentage of purchases to causes) and ultimately worked his way up to his job as one of two employees at Trillium who devote all their time to social advocacy. In 1992, when he was still an intern at the firm, he wrote a report on which human rights issues most needed attention from concerned investors, and Myanmar was one of them, along with sweatshops and China. So it began.</p>
        <p>And so it continues. Last year, Mr. Billenness noted, Hootie &amp; the Blowfish, a rock band and client of Trillium Asset Management, was playing at a San Diego concert sponsored by Suzuki, which is the target of a consumer boycott for investing in Myanmar. Guess who provided the T-shirts that some of the band members wore reading ''Suzuki Out of Burma''?</p>
