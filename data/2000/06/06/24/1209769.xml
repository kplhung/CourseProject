        <p>Citing a new glitch in its problem-plagued automobile inspection system, New Jersey officials said yesterday that they might abandon a part of the inspection process and instead turn to businesses to help the state meet its federally mandated goals for reducing emissions.</p>
        <p>State officials said this week that the so-called tank pressure test, which detects leaks in vehicle exhaust systems, might not be added to the battery of tests administered under an enhanced auto inspection system that began in December.</p>
        <p>The pressure test, which was to begin July 1, was to have cut smog-causing auto emissions by six tons per day. But the state is concerned that the test would be dangerous to set up, and would add as much as nine minutes to an inspection process that has already been criticized for its long waiting times.</p>
        <p>The new inspection system is part of New Jersey's plan to meet stricter pollution standards under the Federal Clean Air Act. The plan calls for the reduction of 89.5 tons per day of volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxide, which combine to form smog.</p>
        <p>Commissioner Robert C. Shinn of the State Department of Environmental Protection, which devised the plan, is now considering going after sources other than cars and trucks to make up the reduction of six tons of emissions that were to have been obtained by the pressure test, said Peter Page, a department spokesman.</p>
        <p>''That's definitely possible,'' Mr. Page said yesterday. ''The position of the department right now is to get the inspection system operating as designed, and if the pressure test is an obstacle to doing that, then we find a way to compensate for those six tons of emissions, whether we do it from within the inspection system itself or go outside of the system and look at other, stationary sources.''</p>
        <p>The possibility of shifting the burden of reducing emissions from automobiles to such alternatives as dry cleaners and paint shops drew criticism yesterday.</p>
        <p>Jim Sinclair, vice president of the New Jersey Business and Industry Council, said that businesses, led by the refinery industry in particular, have already reduced smog-causing pollutants by two-thirds over the last 15 years, and that the imposition of still tighter restrictions would be unfair and impractical.</p>
        <p>''We've been the best player in all of this,'' Mr. Sinclair said.</p>
        <p>Assemblyman Jack Connors, the ranking Democrat on the Assembly Commerce Committee, said, ''We want to be encouraging business to come here, so it just doesn't sound like a good idea to me.''</p>
        <p>One possible alternative to the pressure test would involve tightening restrictions on tailpipe emissions. But critics said that such a measure would unfairly punish drivers who otherwise might pass the tailpipe test, while rewarding drivers with leaky exhaust systems. ''If you have leaks, your tailpipe emissions are going to be less,'' said Jeff Tittel, executive director of the state chapter of the Sierra Club.</p>
        <p>Jayne O'Connor, a spokeswoman for Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, said that no decision had been made on how to reduce emissions if the pressure test was dropped.</p>
        <p>The pressure test issue is only one of a string of complications involving the state's new auto inspection system.</p>
        <p>This week, officials revealed that during the system's monthly audit for June, 42 out of 73 machines that measure tailpipe emissions failed an accuracy test.</p>
        <p>Dana Sullivan, spokesman for the State Division of Motor Vehicles, said yesterday that the machines' results were off by so little that few cars were likely to have passed or failed improperly.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Carl Golden, a spokesman for Parsons Infrastructure and Technology Group, the company hired to conduct inspections at the state-owned testing locations, said that a consultant had been hired to look into the problem.</p>
