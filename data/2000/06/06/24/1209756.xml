        <p>President Clinton saluted American athletes at an Olympic training center here today and received some expert instruction in pole vaulting, race walking and archery.</p>
        <p>Chad Smith, who hopes to represent the United States in the decathlon at the Olympic Games this fall, showed Mr. Clinton, under a hot sun, how he hoisted himself up in the pole vault. Andrew Hermann, a champion race walker, taught the leader of the free world how to gyrate his hips and swing his arms while gliding along the track. Two archers, Vic Wonderly and Rod White, demonstrated how to shoot Olympic-style bull's-eyes.</p>
        <p>The president, who gave up jogging when he threw out his knee but still golfs whenever he can, watched carefully, questioned the athletes intently but, much to the relief of his aides, declined to put his newly found knowledge to use.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton did, however, salute the athletes preparing for the Games this fall in Sydney, Australia, and announce initiatives he said he hoped would encourage more Americans to break into a sweat.</p>
        <p>He said he was issuing an executive order to bar discrimination in federal education and training programs. He also directed the departments of Education and Health and Human Services to come up with measures to encourage more children to become more physically fit. From 1991 to 1999, the percentage of high school students in daily gym classes declined from 42 percent to 29 percent, he said.</p>
        <p>During his tour of the training center here, one of three such facilities in the United States, the president saw athletes honing their skills for the Games.</p>
        <p>''I want you to win all the medals you can,'' Mr. Clinton told several hundred athletes who took a break from their routines to hear him. ''But I want you to realize that by what you have accomplished already, and by the way you have done it, you have already made your country very proud.''</p>
