        <p>A former official of the Central Intelligence Agency has provided fresh evidence to support accusations that a top Democratic Party official sought to enlist the agency to aid a major donor to President Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign.</p>
        <p>In an unpublished manuscript, the former official -- identified in Congressional investigations into Democratic fund-raising only as ''Bob from the C.I.A.'' -- describes a telephone conversation he said he had with Donald Fowler, then the chairman of the Democratic National Committee.

        <p>A former official of the Central Intelligence Agency has provided fresh evidence to support accusations that a top Democratic Party official sought to enlist the agency to aid a major donor to President Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign.</p>
        <p>In an unpublished manuscript, the former official -- identified in Congressional investigations into Democratic fund-raising only as ''Bob from the C.I.A.'' -- describes a telephone conversation he said he had with Donald Fowler, then the chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Mr. Fowler was seeking the agency's help for Roger Tamraz, a Lebanese-American entrepreneur who had contributed at least $300,000 to the Democratic Party.</p>
        <p>Accusations that Mr. Fowler sought to use the C.I.A. on behalf of Mr. Tamraz rocked the agency in early 1997 when they surfaced in the midst of the confirmation hearings in the bid by the national security adviser, Anthony Lake, to become director of central intelligence. Mr. Lake withdrew his nomination as soon as the accusations of Democratic efforts to politicize the agency emerged. Later that year, Mr. Tamraz became a star witness in the Congressional investigation into Democratic campaign fund-raising.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fowler also testified, telling a Senate committee investigating the campaign finance scandal that he could not recall ever talking to a C.I.A. officer in order to help Mr. Tamraz.</p>
        <p>But ''Bob from the C.I.A.'' never testified publicly about the matter. At the time, he was still under cover as an officer in the Directorate of Operations, the agency's clandestine espionage arm, and even his last name remained classified. He gave a deposition to Senate investigators, and left the agency not long after the Tamraz affair.</p>
        <p>Now, in his book-length manuscript, he writes that Mr. Fowler wanted him to help Mr. Tamraz overcome resistance by White House staffers who were trying to prevent Mr. Tamraz from meeting with President Clinton. Mr. Tamraz wanted support from the Clinton administration for his plan to build an oil pipeline in the Caspian Sea region.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tamraz had previously had a secret relationship with the agency, and when he ran into resistance from officials at the National Security Council at the White House, he told Mr. Fowler that the agency might be able to pry open the White House doors so he could meet with President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore. Mr. Tamraz gave Mr. Fowler ''Bob's'' name, since he was then a senior manager in the agency's Central Eurasian Division.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Fowler insisted in his Congressional testimony that he could not recall ever having called the agency on Mr. Tamraz's behalf. The notes also made it clear that Mr. Fowler understood Bob's C.I.A. affiliation, according to the Senate campaign finance committee's report on the matter.</p>
        <p>''I am very sensitive to the implications of perjury statutes,'' Mr. Fowler told the Senate campaign finance committee in 1997. ''But I have in the middle of the night, at high noon, late in the afternoon, early in the morning -- at every hour of the day for months now searched my memory about conversations with the C.I.A., and I have no memory -- no memory of any conversations with the C.I.A.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fowler, who served as chairman of the Democratic National Committee in 1995 and 1996, said again in an interview today that he could not recall any conversations with an agency official on Mr. Tamraz's behalf. ''I've been through that a hundred times, and I just have no memory of any of that,'' said Mr. Fowler. ''I have made multiple statements about that, and don't have anything else to say about it.''</p>
        <p>In the new manuscript, Bob writes that on Oct. 18, 1995, Mr. Tamraz called him at his office at the agency. ''A fellow named Don Fowler is going to call you,'' Mr. Tamraz is quoted as telling Bob. ''Please talk to him.''</p>
        <p>At that point, Bob writes, he did not know who Don Fowler was. So he took Mr. Fowler's number from Mr. Tamraz, and called him to see who he was and what was going on.</p>
        <p>''Fowler called back the next day -- October 19th, and identified himself as the chairman of the Democratic National Committee,'' the manuscript says. ''I never identified myself as a C.I.A. employee, and Fowler never referred to my C.I.A. employment, but it was nevertheless obvious that he knew exactly who I was. He told me he was trying to help his good friend Roger Tamraz. He told me straight out that he was upset with'' two National Security Council officials ''because they were blocking Tamraz's access to the president, and they were doing it for the benefit of major corporations like Amoco. He said that Roger had been disinvited to a White House fund-raising event, and so Roger had complained to Fowler. I guessed Roger had given the D.N.C. chairman my name as someone from C.I.A. who could vouch for him.''</p>
        <p>In its final report on its investigation into campaign fund-raising, the Senate committee said that ''it is likely'' that Mr. Fowler's claims that he couldn't recall his contact with Bob were false.</p>
        <p>The C.I.A. has blocked publication of the manuscript, arguing that it contains too much classified material about agency operations. Since the author submitted the manuscript to be cleared in December, the agency's publications review board has repeatedly demanded numerous changes, despite a requirement that the review process be completed in 30 days. Current and former C.I.A. officials are required by law to seek agency clearance for books or articles they publish to ensure that they do not divulge classified information.</p>
        <p>Bob said he now believes that the agency's demands have been so excessive that the manuscript cannot be published in its current form.</p>
        <p>The author and his Washington lawyer, Victoria Toensing, have appealed the decisions of the review board to the agency's executive director. In the meantime, HarperCollins, the New York publisher, has canceled its contract to publish the manuscript, a spokeswoman said.</p>
        <p>Disputes between the agency and Bob and his lawyer over the manuscript have intensified in recent days, after security personnel sought to retrieve copies of a letter Ms. Toensing had written to the agency's executive director concerning the manuscript. An agency spokesman said the incident was prompted by the fact that the C.I.A. believed the letter contained classified information, and Ms. Toensing had sent the letter to the agency over an unclassified fax machine. But Ms. Toensing said in an interview today that she had been using the same machine to communicate with the agency on matters related to the manuscript for months.</p>
        <p>A C.I.A. security official called Ms. Toensing's office and talked to her son, Brady Toensing, who is also a lawyer, since Ms. Toensing was traveling at the time. The security officer said she wanted to search the law office's files and computer hard drives for classified information, according to Mr. Toensing. He said he denied the request. On June 15, two C.I.A. security personnel arrived at Ms. Toensing's law offices. Mr. Toensing said he gave them the letter, and assured them he had erased copies of the letter from the office computers. The security personnel left without renewing their request to search the office or Ms. Toensing's computers, Mr. Toensing said today.</p>
        <p>Bill Harlow, a spokesman for the agency, denied that the security personnel had ever asked to search the computer hard drives in Ms. Toensing's offices.</p>
        <p>Another C.I.A. spokesman, Mark Mansfield, insists that the agency's objections to the manuscript are not politically motivated or a result of the author's disclosures concerning Democratic fund-raising. Instead, the agency is only opposed to his use of operational details.</p>
        <p>Ms. Toensing responded by saying that the agency has sought to prevent the manuscript's publication by claiming that material like the Tamraz affair, and another incident concerning a prostitute, are classified. ''We have complied with the rules of the pre-publication process,'' she said. ''However, the C.I.A. has made false claims of classified information to thwart publication of this book.''</p>
        <p>Bob wrote his manuscript without identifying his last name at the request of the agency.</p>
