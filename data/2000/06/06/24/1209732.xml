        <p>Open positions of short sales on the New York Stock Exchange rose 1.8 percent in the most recent monthly period, the stock exchange reported this week.</p>
        <p>Uncovered short sales totaled 4.31 billion shares for the month ended June 15, compared with 4.23 billion in the previous month, and up 15.8 percent from the 3.72 billion in the corresponding period a year earlier. The latest short interest was equal to 1.4 percent of the total shares listed on the Big Board.</p>
        <p>On the smaller American Stock Exchange, uncovered short sales declined 8.1 percent, the exchange announced Wednesday. The exchange is owned by the National Association of Securities Dealers. Short sales totaled 181 million shares, down from 196.9 million a month earlier.</p>
        <p>In a short sale, an investor borrows shares from a brokerage firm and sells them, hoping to buy them back at lower prices and make a profit from the difference in prices. If the shares rise in price, the short-seller faces a loss.</p>
        <p>Uncovered short sales -- or those with open positions -- are shares that have been borrowed and sold, but not yet covered by repurchase.</p>
        <p>Large short-sale positions have long been considered an indicator of bearish sentiment among investors. But the level of short interest can fluctuate as a result of a variety of complex trading strategies that can involve options, futures and derivatives.</p>
