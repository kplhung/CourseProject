        <p>Post-graduate high school programs, available at dozens of New England prep schools for decades, are becoming popular among wider pool of applicants in trend driven by increasing frenzy over college admissions; they allow students to take extra year to burnish less-than-stellar academic records or focus on career possibilities; most are clustered in New England, but are drawing applicants nationwide and overseas; almost all applicants are public school students who have not had experience of tiny classes, campus living and close relationships with teachers; public school administrators, including New York City Schools Chancellor Harold O Levy, are recommending fifth year of high school as way to help some students meet increasingly rigorous graduation standards; photo (M)</p>

        <p>The prom was last month, graduation was the second Saturday in June, and Geoff Blumenfeld is now officially finished with Granite Bay High School, outside Sacramento. But next fall, when his classmates start college, he will come East for another year of high school -- a ''post-graduate'' year at Northfield Mount Hermon, a boarding school in Massachusetts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blumenfeld had other options: He was accepted at the University of Colorado, the University of Arizona and San Diego State. But he has his sights set higher, and like a growing number of young people he is hoping that a post-graduate year will win him better choices.</p>
        <p>''I'd never heard of a post-grad year until my counselor suggested it, and I don't know anyone who's ever done it,'' said Mr. Blumenfeld. ''I played both football and soccer last fall and my grades did take a southward turn. I'm hoping, if I work hard, to get a 100-point gain on my SAT's, have a really great football year, and then get into the U.S. Naval Academy.''</p>
        <p>Post-graduate programs have been around for decades at dozens of New England prep schools like Phillips Exeter, Hotchkiss and Deerfield, most for male athletes who have graduated from public high schools and want an extra year to bulk up, get stronger -- and bolster less-than-stellar academic records. The programs give prep schools some extra wallop on their sports teams, new blood and greater diversity, not to mention tuition upwards of $25,000 for each student.</p>
        <p>But in the last five years, with the competition for entry into top-tier colleges growing more fevered than ever, the postgraduate programs have begun drawing far more applicants and from a wider pool that for the first time includes a substantial number of girls, and boys less interested in athletics than drama, music, or a more impressive academic profile.</p>
        <p>''It's really burgeoned in the 90's, partly driven by the demographics,'' said Jamie Robinson, an admissions officer at the Kent School in Connecticut, where, he said, post-graduate applications have doubled in the last five years. ''There's a tremendous number of kids, and tremendous amount of discretionary income, among the class who'd be interested.''</p>
        <p>Public school administrators, including Chancellor Harold O. Levy of the New York City Schools have even begun to speak of a fifth year of high school as a way to help some students meet increasingly rigorous graduation standards.</p>
        <p>Still, the new popularity of the prep school programs is driven by the increasing frenzy over college admissions.</p>
        <p>''This has been the most competitive college year ever, so the trickle-down was really apparent,'' said Mr. Robinson. ''There are a lot more kids and parents who want to groom it a little more. You see B students with 1,200-1,300 board scores opting for another year to do some community service, some drama, boost their grades.</p>
        <p>''I know it sounds like it could be a year of breathing room, but it seems often to be a year for padding the curriculum vitae.''</p>
        <p>Pam Safford, the admissions director at Northfield Mount Hermon, where applications for 70 post-graduate spots have risen about 25 percent in the last five years, said ''We have lots of kids trying to tier up to an Ivy League school.''</p>
        <p>''Of this year's class, I'd say only about half do sports,'' she said. ''I'm hearing lots more parents say this is where they want to invest their money, particularly if they've seen their older kids go off to college not quite mature enough to thrive.''</p>
        <p>Students offer many different reasons for choosing a post-graduate year: learning better study skills, exploring interests they overlooked in high school, playing another year of sports without using their N.C.A.A. eligibility, improving their SAT scores, or gaining more distance from a troubled sophomore or junior year.</p>
        <p>For many students, especially in parts of the country where post-graduate programs are not well known, the transition from high school to prep school can be complicated.</p>
        <p>''At the end of high school, I got so tired of explaining it at all the graduation parties,'' said Damien Chaviano, an Illinois high school graduate who spent this year at Exeter and will attend Middlebury College in the fall. ''It was just unbearable, so I kind of passed it off as a small college in the East. Then in the fall, my buddies would call at 2 a.m., out partying, and I'm sitting there, studying for Saturday classes, just heartbroken. But I got more of a grip on my study habits, and more focus.''</p>
        <p>As the post-graduate programs become better known, some are getting to be as selective as top colleges: Exeter had nearly 300 applications this year for 25 slots, and Deerfield had more than 140 for 20 slots.</p>
        <p>And while most of the programs are clustered in New England, they draw applicants nationwide -- and overseas -- almost all from public school students who have not had the experience of tiny classes, campus living and close relationships with teachers.</p>
        <p>''My classes had more than 30 kids,'' said Vivian Harbert-Erceg, a graduate of McMinville High School in Oregon who will attend Exeter, in New Hampshire, next fall. ''At Exeter, it may be a dozen kids in a class, and I'll get to study things like ornithology and marine biology that a public high school like ours just doesn't have. I'm going to do a lot of drama, and it will let me acclimate to the East.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Harbert-Erceg said she neither knew, nor cared, that the programs traditionally were almost all male. The preponderance of boys, most schools say, reflects the same developmental gap that leads many parents to hold back their sons an extra year before kindergarten.</p>
        <p>''A lot of boys are a year behind girls developmentally and socially,'' said Lisa Antell, director of admissions at Bridgton Academy, a boys' school in Maine just for post-graduates. ''Whether it's starting kindergarten or starting college, a lot of them need that extra year to focus.''</p>
        <p>While it is still not common, a few students are choosing a post-graduate program even after being admitted to the college of their choice: Bryson Grover, for example, deferred admission to the University of Virginia for a year so he could attend Deerfield Academy in Massachusetts.</p>
        <p>''Every one of my siblings told me that when they got to college, they didn't know how to study, they didn't know how to sit down and organize their time,'' said Mr. Grover, who feels uncertain about his college readiness, despite completing a slew of Advanced Placement courses at his Virginia high school. ''Deerfield has dynamite facilities, like an awesome observatory. U. Va. will hold a place for me, and I'll still have four years for the college experience. I don't see any downside.''</p>
        <p>For many post-graduates, though, the programs are more a fallback than a positive choice.</p>
        <p>''I'd applied to four schools where I thought I had a pretty good chance -- Amherst, Williams, Middlebury and Colby -- and I didn't get in anywhere,'' said Jared Passmore, a football star at his Massachusetts high school who spent this year at Northfield Mount Hermon. ''It was pretty awful. In high school I could get B's and a couple A's without much work, and colleges saw that as not applying myself, which was true. And I used to have this tendency, when I was taking standardized tests, and filling in all those ovals, to start thinking about football plays, and fill in the one in the position I needed to make the play.''</p>
        <p>As a post-graduate, Mr. Passmore worked hard, improved his SAT's -- and won admission to Swarthmore, one of the nation's most competitive colleges.</p>
        <p>''There's absolutely no way I could have gotten into Swarthmore without this year,'' he said. ''It was really awkward at the beginning. My friends were going off to M.I.T. and Harvard. And I'm at this place where they lock the dorms at 10:30 and turn the phones off from 8 p.m. to 10 for study hall. But I'm very glad I did it. I think I've matured as a person, and I think it helped colleges see me as someone who's serious about what he wants to do in life.''</p>
        <p>Like colleges, post-graduate programs vary widely. Some, like Exeter, are known for rigorous academic standards, while others are celebrated for their athletics: Dozens of Division I college coaches come to watch promising players at schools like Maine Central Institute, and New Hampton in New Hampshire.</p>
        <p>''Usually, there's two groups of post-graduates on the team,'' said Jamie Arsenault, the basketball coach at New Hampton. ''There are those that would go to college if they could, but they don't qualify academically. And there's another group that come from small schools, where they haven't been seen, so they need the exposure.''</p>
        <p>Whether at New Hampton or Exeter, most post-graduate programs are small, in part because having too many outstanding older athletes -- by their very nature, ringers in high school competition -- inevitably keeps some home-grown students who played throughout high school from making varsity; many schools have limits on how many post-graduates can play on a team.</p>
        <p>And as more musicians and actors have been drawn to the programs, similar concerns are beginning to arise about featured roles in school plays or chamber ensembles.</p>
        <p>Often, students are referred to a prep school by a college admissions officer who thinks they could benefit from a post-graduate year.</p>
        <p>''When I applied to Wesleyan, the director of admissions suggested that I would be a good post-graduate candidate,'' said Angelique Owanga, who moved to Atlanta from Zaire three years ago and will be a post-grad this year at Northfield Mount Hermon. ''When I got into the program, with financial aid, I thought it would be right for me. I had a good grade point average but my S.A.T.'s were not as good as I expected, and I want to do better.''</p>
