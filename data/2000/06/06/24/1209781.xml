        <p>THE DEMOCRATS</p>
        <p>GORE SAYS HE'S HIS OWN MAN  Vice President Al Gore is not running for a third Clinton term. So he told Barbara Walters in an interview that ran last night on the ABC News program ''20/20.'' Asked what President Clinton's role in his presidential campaign would be, Mr. Gore said, ''It's not a Clinton third term.'' Of the notion that he ''flip-flops'' on various matters, including abortion and gun control, Mr. Gore said: ''Don't you want somebody who learns from experience? I mean, I have. And I think that if you, if you don't learn from experience, you're really not paying attention.'' Asked for his strengths and weaknesses, he said that his strength was ''working hard, having my heart in the right place'' and that his weakness was ''sometimes I turn too much to my head'' in thinking through problems rather than allowing himself ''to feel the emotional dimension.''</p>

        <p>THE CONVENTIONS</p>
        <p>G.O.P. LAUNCHES MORE WEB SITES  Several new Web sites  allow voters to participate in the Republican convention from home. One such site, www.gopconvention.com,  allows people to register as ''dot-com delegates'' and participate in the convention through online ''floor passes'' and streaming video of convention proceedings.  Another site, www.2000gop.com, has an interactive electoral college as well as Internet polling: ''Can Bush win? Click here to decide!'' At www.votedaq.com, armchair political activists can bet on their favorites through a virtual stock market made up of political candidates. Each candidate is turned into a stock and voters can buy and sell shares -- candidates' prices rise and fall along with their political fate. Who's hot? Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate for president. His shares rose 16.24 percent this week in heavy trading.</p>

        <p>PHILADELPHIA RESTRICTS MASKED PROTESTS  Hoping to prevent violent protests at the Republican National Convention, the Philadelphia City Council has passed an ordinance that prohibits the wearing of a mask with the intent to commit a crime. The measure was approved Thursday and imposes fines of $75 to $300. The Philadelphia Police Department had lobbied for the ordinance, saying it would help control the demonstrations expected during the convention, to be held from July 31 to Aug. 3. Deputy Commissioner Robert Mitchell said some protesters wore masks while damaging businesses during the World Trade Organization talks in Seattle last fall. Opponents had argued that it would be impossible for the police to determine the intent of those wearing masks. The sponsor of the bill, Councilman Rick Mariano, said it would not affect Philadelphia's annual Mummers Parade on New Year's Day, which features thousands of masked musicians.</p>

        <p>THE STATES</p>
        <p>PENNSYLVANIA ELECTION DISPUTED  The Democratic candidate in a closely watched legislative election held on Tuesday in Pennsylvania is claiming victory. But Republicans are calling for an investigation, saying voter fraud may have occurred. Control of the state's House of Representatives was the dominant issue in the contest because the legislature will begin redrawing state and federal election districts next year. Going into the election, to fill a vacant Scranton-area seat, Republicans held a 101-to-99 edge in the Pennsylvania House, and both parties had sent in their big guns to help their candidates. Vice President Al Gore campaigned for the Democrat, Jim Wansacz, and President Clinton did some broadcast ads for him; Gov. Tom Ridge came in to help the Republican, Tom Parry. In the final vote tally, Mr. Wansacz beat Mr. Parry, 8,569 to 7,619.</p>
