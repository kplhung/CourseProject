        <p>Churchill Downs, home of the Kentucky Derby, continued its aggressive strategy of buying racetracks yesterday when it signed an agreement to acquire Arlington Park near Chicago for stock worth more than $71 million.</p>
        <p>The purchase is the fourth in the last two years for Churchill Downs, which has bought or merged with Ellis Park in Kentucky, Calder in Florida and Hollywood Park in Los Angeles. The addition of Arlington gives Churchill a major Midwest track that opened 73 years ago and now generates business from live racing all summer and simulcast television betting, and the track's parent company plans to open a riverboat casino in Rosemont, Ill.</p>

        <p>Churchill Downs, home of the Kentucky Derby, continued its aggressive strategy of buying racetracks yesterday when it signed an agreement to acquire Arlington Park near Chicago for stock worth more than $71 million.</p>
        <p>The purchase is the fourth in the last two years for Churchill Downs, which has bought or merged with Ellis Park in Kentucky, Calder in Florida and Hollywood Park in Los Angeles. The addition of Arlington gives Churchill a major Midwest track that opened 73 years ago and now generates business from live racing all summer and simulcast television betting, and the track's parent company plans to open a riverboat casino in Rosemont, Ill.</p>
        <p>The deal, which will be closed by Aug. 31, strengthens Churchill's strategic position in a business race with Frank Stronach of Toronto, who has been building a racing empire that includes Santa Anita in California and Gulfstream Park in Florida, and that may soon include Monmouth Park on the Jersey Shore.</p>
        <p>The rapid consolidation of racetracks represents a landmark turn of events for thoroughbred racing, which has been suffering in recent years from declines in attendance and wagering. And the trend has been mainly the work of Stronach, chairman of a worldwide automobile parts company, and Thomas Meeker, chairman of Churchill Downs.</p>
        <p>They intend to create networks of racetracks that would assure them a constant source of talent, or racehorses, and a constant flow of simulcast betting revenue. They also are consolidating a business that two years ago set up the National Thoroughbred Racing Association as a ''league office'' to unify the country's racing, but the association so far has spent millions on marketing projects and gimmicks with few benefits for the racetracks.</p>
        <p>''The horse racing industry is consolidating in response to a changing market and new distribution systems,'' Meeker said. ''Additionally, this agreement will enhance our position in the sizable Chicago market and expand the Churchill Downs Simulcast Network by adding a signal that is well known throughout the United States and in major international markets.''</p>
        <p>Terry Meyocks, president of the New York Racing Association, which runs Belmont Park, Aqueduct and Saratoga, declined at first to comment on the threat posed by the Stronach and Meeker acquisitions. But he did say:</p>
        <p>''As long as we maintain our purse structure and our facilities, we're not worried about getting our supply of horses. But we'll have to be certain to raise purses and keep facilities that will make horsemen want to keep coming.''</p>
        <p>Richard L. Duchossois, the owner and chairman of Arlington's parent company, Duchossois Industries, will receive 3.15 million shares of common stock in Churchill Downs. Churchill Downs, which has about 9.9 million shares outstanding, closed at 231 16  yesterday.</p>
        <p>He may also receive as many as 1.25 million additional shares, depending mainly on implementation of the riverboat casino. He will occupy a seat on Churchill's executive committee and on its board of directors, along with three of his colleagues. The track also operates five off-track betting parlors in Illinois.</p>
        <p>''This business combination,'' Duchossois said, ''will enable us to coordinate quality racing schedules throughout the Midwest and will greatly benefit Illinois racing.''</p>
        <p>Arlington Park was closed two years ago by Duchossois, who complained that he could no longer compete with other betting businesses. But the track was reopened this year on May 14, and will operate until Sept. 30.</p>
