        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Verlyn Klinkenborg's article about  Mosholu Golf Course (''Golfing Here and There,'' The City Life, June 18) brought back some wonderful memories of Mosholu Park and Van Cortlandt Park from the mid-1920's and 1930's.</p>
        <p>Seventy years ago, people went to the Parks Department, located in Central Park, and bought a metal numbered disk for $5. That disk allowed us to play at any municipal course in New York City an unlimited number of times. When we got to the course, we were given a slip with our arrival time. If a foursome had to be made up, the earliest arrival would be called to fill the opening. A single would find that he was playing with three strangers who quickly became friends.</p>

        <p>Those were great times. I made many long-lasting friends. (I am now 85.)</p>
