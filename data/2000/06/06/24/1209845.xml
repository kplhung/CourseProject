        <p>The State Legislature voted yesterday to notify the public about malpractice judgments and disciplinary actions against doctors practicing in New York State. The information would be posted on the Internet and available through a toll-free telephone number.</p>
        <p>The measure, which Gov. George E. Pataki said he was studying, would put New York among a handful of states that give consumers extensive information about the practice histories of doctors and the quality of hospitals. The state already provides a Web site listing the names of doctors it has taken disciplinary action against, but it contains much less information than the new law would require. Also, few New Yorkers know about the site, health care policy experts say.</p>
        <p>The bill would require the Department of Health to post on its Web site everything from the mundane -- doctors' education, hospital affiliations, professional awards -- to the damning -- malpractice history and hospital dismissals that stemmed from harm to patients. The measure would also require the state health commissioner to develop a notice to be posted in hospital and doctors' offices alerting patients to the site, and to an 800 number that they might also call to get the listings.</p>
        <p>In another last-minute agreement early Thursday morning, the Assembly and the Senate resolved a procedural squabble and passed a hate crimes bill that Mr. Pataki said he intended to sign. The bill provides tougher penalties for a variety of crimes when the victims are singled out on the basis of race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age or disability. The Assembly had passed it, in various forms, 11 years in a row, but the Senate had refused until this year, balking in particular at the inclusion of sexual orientation in the list of victim classes.</p>
        <p>The malpractice notification bill had been foundering in the Senate earlier this year, but it gained momentum late in the session after several charges of egregious negligence were brought by the state against doctors and hospitals. It was further bolstered by an order to all 50 states by President Clinton to improve the reporting of medical errors. The president's decree followed a report that 44,000 to 98,000 hospital patients per year die because of medical mistakes.</p>
        <p>The bill was strongly opposed by doctors but was supported by an unusual coalition of insurance companies and consumer groups. Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield  placed several full-page newspaper advertisements in favor of the bill, and patients' rights groups, many formed by people harmed by doctors with records of malpractice, haunted Albany awaiting an outcome.</p>
        <p>''We have been strongly advocating for a law that will provide important information and reduce medical errors,'' said Leslie Moran, a spokeswoman for the New York Health Plan Association. ''My belief is this bill points us in the right direction.''</p>
        <p>The measure, known as the health information and quality improvement bill, would also require the state to develop other quality-assurance measures for the public, such as regularly published hospital report cards and data about the outcomes of various procedures, like the state's current statistics on heart surgery survival rates. ''In the end, we will have the most extensive information among the states that consumers can use,'' said State Senator Kemp Hannon, the Health Committee chairman.</p>
        <p>Other states with aggressive reporting laws include Massachusetts, which was the Assembly's model for its bill, and Florida.</p>
        <p>It is still unclear whether Governor Pataki will ultimately sign the bill, which he has voiced measured support for all year. At a news conference yesterday, he said he was not familiar enough with the details of the bill to make a commitment.</p>
        <p>Five versions of the bill, some from the State Senate and others from the Assembly, wound their way through negotiations until the Senate finally approved a version early yesterday morning. The Assembly, loath to surrender parts of the bill that its members had considered crucial, finally voted to approve the bill before lunch yesterday.</p>
        <p>Among the Assembly's concessions was a clause that ensures doctors that lawsuit settlements would normally be disclosed on the state's Web site only if a doctor settled more than two suits in a 10-year period; but even if there were just one or two settlements, the state could disclose them if the health commissioner found that they were of great interest to public health. The Assembly had wanted all such settlements over 10 years listed.</p>
        <p>A separate bill that would have required office-based surgical centers to report errors died on the Senate floor. Hospitals are required to report incidents in which patients are harmed. The Assembly's version of the bill would have held surgeries performed in doctors' offices to the same reporting standards. But doctors, who hated that provision, found a way to defeat it, albeit at a price. Legislators lifted an old cap on the amount that lawyers could reap from malpractice suits, and some lawmakers said that this gave the doctors enough leverage to block the office-based surgery bill.</p>
        <p>''The Senate took care of the lawyers and doctors and left patients hanging,'' said Assemblyman Richard N. Gottfried, chairman of the Assembly's Health Committee.  ''But,'' he added, ''this is clearly at least two-thirds of a loaf, which is a lot better than none.''</p>
        <p>Doctors have long asserted that malpractice judgments were often misleading, and that patients did not understand, for instance, that some specialties, like obstetrics and neurosurgery, generate a disproportionate number of cases.</p>
        <p>''Frankly, we continue to oppose the agreement,'' said Michael S. Murphy, a spokesman for the state Medical Society, which had lobbied hard against the bill. He added that doctors took ''some consolation that the Legislature recognized that New York's tort system cannot be an absolute measure of physician competence.''</p>
        <p>Many parts of the bill address high-profile cases brought by the state against doctors in the last two years. The case that set the Assembly in motion was the death of Lisa Smart, who died during a normally routine gynecological surgery at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. An assisting surgeon in the operation, Dr. Marc Sklar, was on probation with the state at the time, as was another doctor in his practice. Under the new law, the Web site, http://www.health.state.ny.us /nysdoh/opmc/main.htm, would post the names of other doctors in practice with the doctor in question.</p>
        <p>The new requirement of listing the hospitals where doctors have lost their right to practice was apparently in response to the case earlier this year of Dr. Allan Zarkin, who carved his initials into a patient's skin after delivering her baby. Dr. Zarkin was fired from the hospital where the baby was delivered, but he went on to work at an abortion clinic for several months while the state investigated.</p>
        <p>''This is an excellent beginning,'' said Connie Wynne, whose son Alexander died last year of complications that stemmed from what she contends was a botched delivery by a doctor with a history of malpractice judgments and settlements and state disciplinary actions. She did not know about the existing Web site when her son was born in 1998, but the site would not have mentioned the malpractice history anyway.</p>
        <p>''If people have access to information, then that will be great,'' Ms. Wynn said. ''I believe my son would be alive had this been passed earlier.''</p>
