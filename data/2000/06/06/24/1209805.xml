        <p>He was a Vietnam veteran from Arkansas who was moved by the story of a little-known heroine and victim of the Holocaust. So Fletcher Clement decided that a racehorse should bear the name of Roza Robota, a young Polish woman who was instrumental in a brief uprising at Auschwitz.</p>
        <p>His idea, though unorthodox, was that he could help tell her story, and in the simplest of ways, he has. The tale of the young woman who bravely lost her life is retold each time the racehorse runs, even if it's heard only within racing circles.</p>
        <p>It will be told again today at Belmont Park where Roza Robata the racehorse -- misspelled because of an administrative error -- will make her 31st career start in a field of six in the prestigious Grade I, $250,000 Hempstead Handicap. The 5-year-old mare has won eight races, earned $583,430 in purses and, say those who have been associated with her, has displayed a remarkable energy and toughness.</p>
        <p>''I was very hesitant and a little worried that I would offend Jewish people by combining this horrific episode with horse racing,'' said Clement, 57, a commercial real estate broker who made the decision to name the horse after Robota. ''But I checked around with some friends of mine who are Jewish, told them the story, and finally decided that it would be nice to honor this courageous lady.''</p>
        <p>Michael Berenbaum, former director of the Research Institute at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, and currently a distinguished visiting Professor of Holocaust Studies at Richard Stockton College in California, said Roza Robota is little known outside scholarly circles. He acknowledged that some may be offended by a horse carrying the name of a tragic figure from one of the most horrific periods of world history.</p>
        <p>''There may be those who are offended,'' he said. ''I'm not. It's an opportunity to use the name of a horse to tell a story that is not well known about a person who should be remembered in the annals of heroism.''</p>
        <p>Sara Bloomfield, director of the Holocaust museum, said: ''It's complicated. If the motive is to memorialize this young woman and spread awareness about the Jewish resistance, which is not well known among the public, it is very admirable. However, there may be some survivors who might feel that connecting the Holocaust to a racehorse, which represents how people spend leisure time, would be a trivialization of an enormous tragedy.''</p>
        <p>In the middle of this unusual story is Clement, who for almost 30 years  has bought and raced horses. For even longer, he has studied what has gone on in the world. He was a history major at the University of Arkansas-Little Rock. He developed an interest in the Holocaust after serving as a communications specialist in the Army Special Forces from 1965 to 1966 in Bu Dop near the Cambodia border.</p>
        <p>''Maybe as a veteran it gave me an affinity for people in untenable positions,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In the mid-1980's he came across a photograph of Roza Robota and the story of her role in the Oct. 7, 1944, uprising by the Jewish Sonderkommando of Auschwitz-Birkenau -- the all-male detail forced to work in the death camps. For weeks leading up to the uprising, Robota, along with three other young women, smuggled gunpowder in small amounts out of a munitions plant they were assigned to as prisoners.</p>
        <p>The uprising ended badly, although one crematorium was destroyed. Several hundred prisoners escaped, all of whom were caught and killed by German forces the same day, Bloomfield said. Later that day, Bloomfield said, an additional 200 prisoners were executed by the Germans.</p>
        <p>''It was a significant act of resistance,'' Berenbaum said. ''It was not a decision to live but a decision on how to die. It gave the victims a personal death in the impersonal process of killings.''</p>
        <p>Three days later, on Oct. 10, Robota was arrested with the other women. She was beaten and tortured, and then on Jan. 6, 1945, Robota, Regina Safirsztain, Ella Gartner, and Esther Wajcblum were hanged -- just 12 days before the Germans abandoned the camp as their war effort began to crumble.</p>
        <p>''Not only in the deed was she brave, but so were her last words,'' Berenbaum said. ''She said, 'Be strong, have courage,' as the trap doors opened.''</p>
        <p>The story haunted Clement, especially after he visited Auschwitz in the mid-1990's. In April 1997 he attended the Ocala Breeders sale in Florida in the hopes of adding to his small stable. A self-described ''bottom fisher,'' Clement is in the majority of horse buyers who enter the bidding process long after the wealthiest owners, with their private jets and deep pockets, have abandoned the sales ring.</p>
        <p>After failing to land a colt he fancied when the bidding reached a too- rich $20,000, Clement became captivated by a spirited, dark brown 2-year-old filly. She was already named Firey May Day, but there was something about the way she held her head up. He bought her for $12,000 and thought hard about changing her name to Roza Robota. He didn't take the decision lightly.</p>
        <p>The Jockey Club, which registers the names of thoroughbreds, allows a name change if a horse has not yet raced, as was the case with this mare. What's in an actual name is reviewed by the organization, which approved 40,853 names in 1999 alone. The rules for naming a horse range from a maximum of 18 characters including punctuation, for example, to outlawing notorious names and requiring written permission from famous living people.</p>
        <p>And it is not unusual to find horses with names that are linked to real people or real events. Among the recent Triple Crown competitors, there was Hugh Hefner, named for the Playboy magazine founder, and Impeachment, whose name was derived from the colt's sire, Deputy Minister, and his dam, Misconduct, although the horse's owner, Cot Campbell, acknowledged the name had special resonance because of the proceeding the United States Congress took against President Clinton.</p>
        <p>Six years ago a horse named Irgun was a strong contender for the Kentucky Derby until being sidelined with a sore foot. Irgun was named after the Jewish underground group that fought the British and the Arabs a half-century ago in what is now Israel. And 26 years ago a horse named Chris Evert -- after the tennis star -- was the best 3-year-old filly in the nation.</p>
        <p>Some owners treat the naming of horses as a game and try to get racy or nonsensical names with personal significance past the organization. Mike Pegram, owner of the 1998 Kentucky Derby winner Real Quiet, named his champion filly Silverbulletday after a brand of beer.</p>
        <p>''About 71 percent of the people get their first preference with names,'' said Buddy Bishop, the Jockey Club registrar. ''We are very careful. But you always can get a name nobody knows.''</p>
        <p>It's likely that no one at the Jockey Club recognized the name Roza Robota. Clement says he believes he turned the name in with the correct spelling and it came back Robata. If not, he will accept blame for the mistake. While racing the horse in her campaigns as a 2- and 3-year-old, Clement told the story as often as he could.</p>
        <p>Roza Robata did well for Clement, earning more than $100,000 and winning the Grade III Honeybee Stakes in Arkansas. After that race, Clement put her up for auction as a broodmare at Keeneland in Lexington, Ky. Roza Robata was bought for $150,000 by Ron McKee who thought she had more races left before being relegated to breeding. Last spring, after she won the Fairway Fun Stakes at Turfway Park, McKee heard from a friend and sometime partner named Jimmy Iselin. It was Iselin who was aware of the life of the real Roza Robota. He told McKee.</p>
        <p>''It was fascinating,'' said McKee, an Indianapolis businessman. ''Everyone I tell is intrigued.''</p>
        <p>Both Clement and McKee say that Roza Robata is the best racehorse they have ever owned. They also feel compelled to pass on the tale of the woman the mare is named for. Even though it's a horse, involved in a sport in which sentiment often takes a back seat to the cold calculations of betting, Clement says he believes the story of a brave young woman is being passed on, and that her memory is being honored.</p>
        <p>''She's a footnote in the Holocaust annals,'' Clement said. ''She shouldn't be.''</p>
