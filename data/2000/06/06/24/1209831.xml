        <p>For 12 years, Jerry West worked to rebuild the Los Angeles Lakers into a championship team. He cleared enough space beneath the salary cap to acquire the game's most dominant center, shrewdly maneuvered a draft-day deal to sign a prodigy out of high school and, to top it all off, helped woo the league's most successful coach.</p>
        <p>But just four days after Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant and Phil Jackson led the Lakers to their first National Basketball Association title since 1988, West admitted yesterday that he was uncertain of his future with the organization.</p>
        <p>A league executive said yesterday that West would soon resign as the Lakers' executive vice president for basketball operations. When reached in his Los Angeles office yesterday, West did not refute the notion that he would leave the Lakers during the off-season. Although he said that his retirement was not imminent, the 62-year-old West also declined to say that he would be around to watch the team he assembled defend its title.</p>
        <p>''I have no idea what I'm going to do,'' West said. ''When you've been in this business for a long time, I think we all get to the point sometime where we think, 'Why do I need this?' But I certainly felt that way the last two years and I haven't done anything, so I don't know what I'm going to do.''</p>
        <p>West, an executive in the Lakers' front office since 1982, has entertained the idea of retiring before, most recently after the 1997-98 season. He now has a three-year, $10.5 million contract extension that runs through the 2002-03 season, but he said that that would not necessarily stop him from retiring this summer. He implied that he might make a decision after this summer's activities, which include the draft and the free-agent signing period.</p>
        <p>''I told everyone, until our season's over, and our season's not over, I've got work to do,'' West said. ''I'm supposed to be here until September. Because I have a contract doesn't make any difference. I don't have to hold them to that, and they don't have to hold me to it, either.''</p>
        <p>A person close to West said he could envision West leaving the Lakers in mid- to late July. ''Now that he's won, I think he actually might do it,'' the person said. ''The problem is, he's said it before. I won't believe it until it actually happens.''</p>
        <p>It would seem like a strange time for West to step away. After 12 years of trying to return Showtime to Los Angeles, he has done so with a bang, building a team around O'Neal and Bryant that could become a dynasty over the next decade.</p>
        <p>But according to two league executives and another person with knowledge of the Lakers' situation, West is bothered by his decreased role since Jackson arrived. They said Jackson had usurped much of West's decision-making power, angering West and prompting him to consider resigning.</p>
        <p>West, however, denied having any problems with Jackson.</p>
        <p>''That's absolutely ludicrous,'' West said. ''For me, he's been like a breath of fresh air. He's been absolutely great to work with. It would have nothing to do with anything like that. If I step down, it's because I've been here too long. That would be my biggest reason for ever stepping down. I've had a great, great working relationship with Phil. He's made my job a lot easier.''</p>
        <p>It has been no secret, however, that West and Jackson have clashed over the role of Glen Rice in the Lakers' game plan. Believing that Rice's outside shooting ability would make him the perfect complement to O'Neal and Bryant, West traded Elden Campbell and the All-Star guard Eddie Jones for Rice and two others last season. But Rice, with his limited defense and inability to create his own shot, has not fit well into Jackson's triangle offense and has butted heads with the coach. As a result, Rice almost certainly will not be in a Lakers uniform next season.</p>
        <p>West, who has been with the Lakers for 38 years and won seven titles as either a player, coach, consultant or executive, said he will not join another team if he does leave Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>''How could I work for another team?'' West asked rhetorically. ''No way. I've never had another job in my life. I would be so awkward going to another place.''</p>
