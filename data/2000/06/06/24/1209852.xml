        <p>Steve Pate shot a six-under-par 65 yesterday for a share of the second-round lead with Bob May in the St. Jude Classic in Memphis.</p>
        <p>Pate, who has struggled this year after winning the PGA Tour's comeback player award last year, had eight birdies and two bogeys for a 10-under 132 total.</p>
        <p>May, who had to go through qualifying to get back on the PGA Tour this year, shot a 66, with five birdies, an eagle and two bogeys.</p>
        <p>Russ Cochran (66) and Joe Ogilvie (68) were tied at 133. David Toms, who shared a one-stroke lead with David Peoples and Ogilvie after the first round, had the lead by himself at 11 under when he fell apart with two double bogeys. He finished with a 69 to match Chris DiMarco (68) at 134.</p>
        <p>John Daly was among those missing the cut of even-par 142. He was at one under with three holes left when he added a triple-bogey 7 to a round that included four bogeys, a double bogey, four birdies and an eagle. He finished with a 74 for a 144 total.</p>
