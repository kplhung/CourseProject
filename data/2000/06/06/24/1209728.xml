      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Lou Savarese believes there are two ways to defeat Mike Tyson.</p>
        <p>''You can move and jab like Buster Douglas did when he beat him,'' Savarese said this week. ''Or you can be clever, move and tie him up at the right times, like Evander Holyfield did.''</p>
        <p>But can Savarese imitate Douglas or Holyfield?</p>
        <p>''You'll have to come to the fight Saturday night and see,'' Savarese said with a smile.</p>
        <p>Tyson, of course, knows well of these theories.</p>
        <p>''I can't be beaten unless I do it to myself,'' he said this week.</p>
        <p>There is precedent for that, too. Indeed, while Savarese is a major step up in competition from Tyson's last opponent, Julius Francis of Britain, there are indications that Tyson may not be taking Savarese seriously enough in his preparation.</p>
        <p>When Tyson went to New York last week for the funeral of his murdered friend, Darryl Baum, he did not train for four days. He also did not train Sunday, the day he flew to England. And his workouts in London and Glasgow since have been described as light.</p>
        <p>So while Tyson weighed in today at 222 pounds -- only a pound below what he weighed for his last three fights -- the question is whether he will have the stamina to fight effectively should the bout continue into the late rounds. Savarese, who weighed in today at 241 1/4 pounds, hopes to extend the fight, which is scheduled for 10 rounds.</p>
        <p>Savarese's camp has worked on a relaxed, poised approach to fighting Tyson, knowing that Tyson will very likely try to take Savarese out with one of his typical, swarming, frenetic early-round assaults.</p>
        <p>Tyson's co-trainer Tommy Brooks said this week that Tyson would end the fight by the fourth round because he wanted to be merciful to the 34-year-old Savarese.</p>
        <p>''Why make Lou suffer?'' Brooks said.</p>
        <p>And Tyson, even at 33 years old and well past his prime, has the punching power to end the fight quickly. But he will probably have to package his punches in combinations, something he once did effectively but has rarely even attempted to do in the last five years in the ring.</p>
        <p>Savarese has been training in Houston for the last few years, often alongside Holyfield.</p>
        <p>''I'm in awe of Evander,'' Savarese said. ''Just for his poise. Mike Tyson bit a piece of his ear off, and Evander didn't even get upset. The fight continued and Evander had to keep fighting. And he did -- he stayed right on his game plan for the fight.</p>
        <p>''I want to do the same thing. We have things we've worked on.''</p>
        <p>Savarese did not say he was going to borrow from Holyfield's technique for twice defeating Tyson, but he certainly seemed to know it well.</p>
        <p>''I've watched the tapes over and over,'' Savarese said. ''There are things he did that worked -- like keeping his leg in between Tyson's legs -- that made a difference. All I'll say is we've been working on things.''</p>
        <p>And Savarese said he got specific advice from Holyfield. ''He just told me to expect some antics from Tyson,'' Savarese said. ''He said: 'Let him do his wild thing, but don't get caught up in it. Stay to your plan.' ''</p>
        <p>Savarese will have height and reach advantages, and he could be the favorite of the crowd inside Glasgow's Hampden Park, Scotland's national soccer stadium.</p>
        <p>Tyson's presence in Glasgow has been received, for the most part, negatively. There could be a lot of Savarese fans in the stands.</p>
        <p>PUNCH LINES</p>
        <p>There were no new developments, denials or published reports concerning the alleged scuffle between MIKE TYSON and FRANK WARREN, the promoter of Saturday's fight. The British newspapers that reported either rumors of the fight or some alleged details -- like Tyson breaking Warren's jaw or ribs -- reported Tyson's denials and Warren's threat to sue for false statements or libel on Friday but little else.</p>
        <p>Warren, however, has not made himself available to anyone in England or Scotland, which is unusual for someone promoting what is a pay-per-view fight in Britain, and there are strong indications there is some financial dispute between Tyson and Warren that goes back to Tyson's January fight in England. That dispute, the British newspapers have reported, is over jewelry Tyson purchased in January.</p>
        <p>ZAB JUDAH, the International Boxing Federation's junior-welterweight champion from New York, will fight JUNIOR WITTER on the undercard.</p>
