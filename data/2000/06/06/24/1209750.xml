        <p>Trying to dampen speculation that the prospects of reconciliation on the Korean peninsula would lead to a smaller American military presence in South Korea, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright stressed today that United States troops would not be withdrawn any time soon.</p>
        <p>With Foreign Minister Lee Joung Binn of South Korea at her side, Dr. Albright said that talk of reducing American troops was ''not appropriate'' and ''premature'' and that the troops would continue to be a deterrent against North Korea and a stabilizing force in the region.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lee said even if the two Koreas agreed to end the Korean War with a peace treaty, American troops would ''continue to play their role as a guarantor of the balance of power.''</p>
        <p>The first senior administration official to visit South Korea after the summit meeting last week between the North and South Korean leaders, Dr. Albright arrived here to learn more about what occurred and to establish Washington's interests as the reconciliation unfolds. She met President Kim Dae Jung and then Mr. Lee.</p>
        <p>Dr. Albright's presence also put a spotlight on the 37,000 American troops here and what role they might have in the future. Protests have been growing at a United States Air Force bombing range 50 miles southwest of the capital for several months.</p>
        <p>At a news conference with Dr. Albright, Mr. Lee said Mr. Kim had told his North Korean counterpart, Kim Jong Il, at their meeting that he wanted American troops to stay in South Korea.</p>
        <p>''We believe that we have expanded the North Korean understanding on this particular issue,'' Mr. Lee said. ''The American forces will be needed here even after the establishment of a peace regime on the Korean peninsula.''</p>
        <p>The nature of the North Korean leader's reply has remained somewhat unclear and was not clarified at the news conference. In the last several days, however, administration officials said they had been pleased that Kim Dae Jung had raised the question of American troops at the Pyongyang meeting and suggested that the North Korean leader's response did not appear to be unsatisfactory.</p>
        <p>One administration official with knowledge of briefings by senior South Korean officials after the summit meeting said the North Korean leader had indicated that he was not eager to have the American troops leave South Korea. It is possible, the official said, to draw a very rough analogy from the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, when the Soviet Union did not push for the pullout of American troops from West Germany.</p>
        <p>North Korea might be content to see a continued American military presence, the official said, albeit in a different mode, to ensure that a vacuum was not created as changes occurred over what could be a drawn-out reunification.</p>
        <p>Another American official said when the South Korean president told Kim Jong Il that he wanted American troops to remain as reunification progressed, the North Korean indicated that he ''was not totally opposed to this,'' the official said, recounting a briefing that South Korean government had given him.</p>
        <p>The success of the Pyongyang meeting caught American policymakers off guard. In the days since then, they have confronted unanticipated questions in public and private about the role of United States troops. In Washington, questions abut the size and components of the military presence are being raised.</p>
        <p>For the moment, officials are stressing that the meeting, as Dr. Albright said today, was promising, but had not resolved anything.</p>
        <p>In answer to a South Korean reporter's question, Dr. Albright said: ''We have alliance structures with Japan and South Korea. We don't put a time limit on our responsibility.''</p>
        <p>The American military role in the South has changed in the last decade. The troops have moved from a leading to a supporting role in defense. But the South Korean government has continued to argue that its own forces could not deter an invasion from North Korea.</p>
        <p>Dr. Albright also tried to emphasize that the United States had its own channels to North Korea. She said that Washington would soon reopen talks with North Korea aimed at curbing its missile development and that it had just completed a round of talks in Rome with North Korea on ensuring that its nuclear program is for civilian use only.</p>
