        <p>From a cramped, three-room office near Wall Street two weeks ago, four young programmers started a frantic virtual duel with America Online, the Internet behemoth.</p>
        <p>A year earlier, they had all been members of the Israeli military's elite computer security unit. But now they were fighting for the future of their start-up company, Odigo Inc., and its tiny instant-messaging service.</p>
        <p>In the end, their David-and-Goliath battle to keep lines open to the 140 million users of AOL's instant-message programs would reach far beyond their corner of Silicon Alley. Even as AOL was denouncing Odigo's programmers as hackers and criminals, the Internet giant announced its support for a worldwide standard for the technology.</p>
        <p>The fight started on a Saturday night two weeks ago, when Avner Ronen, a founder and vice president of Odigo, received the call on his cell phone -- fittingly enough, as he was walking up Third Avenue to a 10:30 p.m. showing of ''Mission: Impossible 2.''</p>
        <p>America Online, Mr. Ronen was told, had just blocked the users of a new version of Odigo's program, released on May 31, from sending messages to or receiving messages from users of AOL Instant Messenger and ICQ, the programs that account for 90 percent of all instant-message users.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ronen, 24, skipped the movie -- leaving his wife -- and quickly took the No. 5 train downtown to the company's office at 11 Broadway.</p>
        <p>''We were a bit surprised,'' he said of AOL's move, but not worried. Like Mr. Ronen himself, ''most of the programmers are veterans from the Israeli defense forces,'' he said. ''They have faced bigger challenges than opening AOL.''</p>
        <p>Instant messages travel over the Internet and quickly pop up on users' screens, allowing instantaneous real-time communication. But users of the different instant-messaging programs have been unable to communicate with each other -- not because it is technically impossible, but because AOL has not allowed it. While more than 40 other software companies, including Odigo, offer such programs, for more than a year AOL has  blocked competitors from reaching its users, citing privacy and security concerns.</p>
        <p>The competitors, most prominently Microsoft, have released new versions of their messaging programs that can communicate with AOL's users, only to have the security team at the company's headquarters in Dulles, Va., track the unique signals of competitors' programs and block their users.</p>
        <p>''It is as if AT&amp;T said that you could not communicate with one of its users from a Sprint line,'' said Ross Bagully, chief executive of Denver-based Tribal Voice Inc., another instant-messaging company.</p>
        <p>Enter Odigo. The company was founded in January 1999 in Israel, but most of its 15 employees moved six months ago to Manhattan's technology-rich Silicon Alley in search of their millions in the Internet gold rush sweeping across America.</p>
        <p>Its employees range in age from a 16-year-old high school student who writes computer codes to the company's 36-year-old director of marketing. ''They are a young, productive, fun group of people who work so many hours each day, go home and then come back to work,'' Mr. Ronen said.</p>
        <p>But Odigo, which provides its instant-messaging service free to users and under contract to Internet providers like Prodigy, StarMedia and Fortune City, found that its efforts to expand its client base were being stifled by AOL's dominance of the market.</p>
        <p>Simply put, Mr. Ronen said, users are reluctant to sign up for new instant-messaging services if they cannot communicate with colleagues, friends and family members who use AOL's two programs. After unsuccessful attempts to talk to AOL about open communication, Mr. Ronen said, Odigo gave up and released the new -- compatible -- version of its software in late May.</p>
        <p>Since then, the number of users of Odigo -- Greek for ''guide'' -- has jumped 10 percent to 800,000, the company said. Mr. Ronen said customers like the unique features that set it apart from AOL's programs, like the ability to create goofy faces to portray themselves online while communicating.</p>
        <p>When AOL started blocking Odigo on June 10, Roee Vulkan, 26, a software engineer who helped design the Israeli defense force's internal intranet system, succeeded in creating a software patch within hours that allowed Odigo users to circumvent AOL's security measures. The company posted the software fix on its Web site.</p>
        <p>It was the opening salvo in what would become more than a week of intense, day-to-day combat between the two companies, with Odigo engineers coming up with new solutions as soon as AOL experts had blocked the previous ones. The battle, which came as the Federal Trade Commission and Federal Communications Commission was reviewing AOL's proposed merger with Time Warner, could have broad implications for the new medium.</p>
        <p>Barry M. Schuler, president of AOL's Interactive Services Group, said his company was not concerned about losing business. Rather, he said, it wants to prevent instant-messaging companies from sending advertising, or selling the e-mail addresses of AOL users. ''All of a sudden you open a Pandora's box, where you kill a product that everyone used to enjoy,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schuler said Odigo had ''illegally entered the AOL system'' by attempting to make its software ''mimic an AOL signature.''</p>
        <p>''Whether it is from a kid sitting with a computer in a garage without his parents' permission,'' he said, ''or the engineering team of a company that is backed by venture capital, hacking is the same.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Ronen said Odigo had done nothing illegal because its programmers had not penetrated AOL's computer system.</p>
        <p>The cat-and-mouse game between AOL and Odigo -- a company where dress is casual, new employees put together their own desks from Ikea and free pizza is served each Friday at noon -- would repeat itself 10 times, with AOL blocking Odigo's unique signature and the small company altering its digital fingerprint to get around the firewall.</p>
        <p>On June 15, AOL released a document outlining its security and privacy concerns about other companies' instant-messaging software and laying out its support -- eventually -- for open communication in the instant message medium.</p>
        <p>It was widely hailed as a victory for the little competitors. ''It is always nice to have friends in the foxhole when you are in a David-and-Goliath fight,'' Mr. Bagully said of Odigo. ''It's always nice to have a bunch of Davids with you sharing the burden.''</p>
        <p>The victory was short-lived. About 15 minutes after releasing the position paper, AOL again blocked Odigo's users. ''They are afraid of competition and want to live on their own, isolated and dominating the market,'' Mr. Ronen said. ''But we are not going to let them.''</p>
        <p>As of yesterday, there was another patch available on the Odigo Web site, www.odigo .com, allowing Odigo users to communicate with AOL users.</p>
