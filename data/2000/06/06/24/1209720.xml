        <p>Wearing a silver-brocade tuxedo, with diamond rings glittering on both hands and his current guitar named Lucille in his lap, B. B. King surveyed his newest domain on Thursday night: the B. B. King Blues Club and Grill at 243 West 42nd Street, where he is performing through tonight. It's a plush basement club with a stage that could hold a big band. The carpets are patterned with guitars, the chair backs have eighth-note cutouts, and images of Mr. King's records are laminated into the tables. A T-shirt concession greets visitors. But with the kind of set he played on Thursday night, Mr. King is entitled to his own theme restaurant.</p>
        <p>It was, in a way, just another set of the blues: shuffles, boogies, jump blues, slow blues and a dollop of New Orleans rhythm-and-blues. Yet it forged the classic blues alchemy of contradictions transcended: of tribulation and party spirit, wounded anger and amusement, private confession and good-time singalong.</p>

        <p>Wearing a silver-brocade tuxedo, with diamond rings glittering on both hands and his current guitar named Lucille in his lap, B. B. King surveyed his newest domain on Thursday night: the B. B. King Blues Club and Grill at 243 West 42nd Street, where he is performing through tonight. It's a plush basement club with a stage that could hold a big band. The carpets are patterned with guitars, the chair backs have eighth-note cutouts, and images of Mr. King's records are laminated into the tables. A T-shirt concession greets visitors. But with the kind of set he played on Thursday night, Mr. King is entitled to his own theme restaurant.</p>
        <p>It was, in a way, just another set of the blues: shuffles, boogies, jump blues, slow blues and a dollop of New Orleans rhythm-and-blues. Yet it forged the classic blues alchemy of contradictions transcended: of tribulation and party spirit, wounded anger and amusement, private confession and good-time singalong.</p>
        <p>The set had a casual but earned sense of history. Mr. King looked back to his childhood, when he picked cotton in Mississippi, and to the rhythm-and-blues of his idol, Louis Jordan. And he addressed the present, recognizing his longtime position as a blues patriarch. He sang that he has ''had everything that money would buy'' but ''never had peace of mind in my lifetime.'' He also posed for tourists' cameras as he played, tossed picks to fans and signed autographs after his set.</p>
        <p>At 74, Mr. King now performs seated. But he sang and played without a hint of waning vigor. His robust voice poked in and around the beat with slyly syncopated timing; it took on a furious growl to remember love gone wrong, and held wry humor when he questioned his children's paternity. He sounded desperate and downhearted as he wondered, ''How blue can you get?'' But he worked the audience with the confidence of a gospel preacher, and cheerfully prescribed, near the end of the set, that ''Making love is good for you.''</p>
        <p>The club's sound system revealed all the nuance in Mr. King's guitar playing. With a tough, distortion-edged tone, he makes phrases push against the beat, and when he reaches one of his famous searing sustained notes -- the ones emulated by Eric Clapton and Carlos Santana -- he wrings emotion from it, squeezing its overtones down to a single clear pitch, then making it seem to rise an octave. On Thursday, his solos grew more unruly as they unfolded, leaping further and defying the beat more boldly. But he was always strategic, always in control; he saved his guitar's high register for keening solos in ''The Thrill Is Gone.''</p>
        <p>In his last encore, Mr. King brought on a younger blues guitarist, Kenny Neal, who played an unabashed tribute to Mr. King's style. Mr. Neal ended his solo with a surprising sustained note that bent upward, down and then up again, drawing a pleased double-take from Mr. King. He congratulated Mr. Neal, saying, ''When there's no more B. B. King, I won't be missed.'' For once, he was wrong.</p>
