        <p>If Judge Samuel Sewall, a prominent and pious Bostonian of Puritan times, is remembered for much these days, it is the literary and historical value of the diaries he kept and his repentance for his role in the Salem witchcraft trials.</p>
        <p>Sewall served on a court appointed by the governor of Massachusetts in 1692 to examine the witchcraft accusations in Salem. Alone among the judges, he later apologized publicly, with a statement read aloud in his church, the Old South Meeting House.</p>
        <p>But today, Sewall might better be remembered for another declaration. June 24 happens to be the 300th anniversary of the printing of a remarkable pamphlet he wrote, offering religious arguments against slavery, which was then legal in Massachusetts. It was one of the earliest antislavery declarations made on American soil, arguing a cause that few people would join until much later, on the eve of the Civil War.</p>
        <p>Sewall titled his pamphlet ''The Selling of Joseph: A Memorial,'' a reference to the story in the 37th chapter of Genesis in which Jacob's sons sell their brother Joseph into slavery in Egypt. The document begins: ''Forasmuch as liberty is in real value next unto life: none ought to part with it themselves, or deprive others of it, but upon most mature consideration.''</p>
        <p>Sewall went on to say, ''It is most certain that all men, as they are sons of Adam, are coheirs; and have equal right unto liberty, and all other comforts of life.'' He also wrote that slavery was not a natural condition for human beings.</p>
        <p>When he wrote the pamphlet, Sewall was nearing 50 years old, serving on Massachusetts' highest court; he would become its chief justice in 1718.</p>
        <p>(It should perhaps be noted that his pamphlet was not the first antislavery declaration published in the Colonies. Mennonites in Germantown, Pa., published a short but strong antislavery statement in 1688.)</p>
        <p>The current pastor of Old South Church, which is now 333 years old, is the Rev. James W. Crawford, who preached a sermon about Sewall a few years back, titled ''The Last Puritan.''</p>
        <p>''He was an amazing man,'' Mr. Crawford said in a telephone interview. ''Not only as a justice, but as a great reader, a great writer. He was on the board of overseers at Harvard College. He was quite an intellectual.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Crawford said he regarded Sewall, with his apology for serving on the witchcraft court and in his antislavery pamphlet, as acting very much in the tradition of Old South, where Benjamin Franklin was baptized and where the Revolutionary patriot Samuel Adams served as a deacon.</p>
        <p>The church, he said, was founded as ''a progressive institution, doing its best to disengage from the rigid Calvinist fundamentalism of the first generation'' of Puritans. Old South, he said, ''always has been in the forefront of recognizing social change and trying to interpret the Gospel to deal with it.''</p>
        <p>These days, the church belongs to the United Church of Christ, a Protestant denomination that traces some of its roots to the Puritans and the Congregationalists who came after them.</p>
        <p>The denomination's president, the Rev. John Thomas, said Sewall's pamphlet will be included in a seven-volume series of theological documents related to the denomination's history, to be published later this year.</p>
        <p>''It's really a lovely reminder of the historical roots that we often ignore,'' Mr. Thomas said, ''that really nourish many of the contemporary involvements of the United Church.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Thomas also acknowledged that ''there were many New England Congregationalists that participated in the slave trade in one way or another, so our story is never a pure one.''</p>
        <p>''And,'' Mr. Thomas said, ''Sewall in his own life embodied that ambiguity -- as a participant in the Salem trial, in a sense representing the worst of what we have been, and then writing this tract, and representing the best of what we have been.''</p>
        <p>The diaries kept by Sewall, who died in 1730, have long been public documents. His entry for June 19, 1700, contains the notation that he had been ''much dissatisfied with the trade of fetching Negros from Guinea,'' and had had ''a strong inclination to write something about it.''</p>
        <p>After reading a contemporary commentary on the Apostle Paul's Letter to the Ephesians, Sewall wrote that day, ''I began to be uneasy that I had so long neglected doing anything.'' He concluded that day's entry by saying he hoped he ''was call'd of God to write'' the pamphlet and that a divine blessing would accompany it.</p>
