        <p>For the second time in a week, the House has voted to permit the Justice Department to use money from other federal departments in a lawsuit against tobacco companies.</p>
        <p>By a vote of 215 to 183, the House today approved an amendment by Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, that allows the Justice Department to receive $12 million from the departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs and Health and Human Services to help support the lawsuit.</p>
        <p>The measure had been strongly supported by the Clinton administration and vigorously opposed by the House Republican leadership.</p>
        <p>Despite the efforts of the House leadership, 55 Republicans backed Mr. Waxman's amendment, more than offsetting the 35 Democrats who voted against it.</p>
        <p>Approval of the measure marks the second time this week that the House has defied the Republican leadership and approved a transfer to the Justice Department to help finance the lawsuit.</p>
        <p>On Monday, the House voted to block the Department of Veterans Affairs from transferring $4 million to the Justice Department. The next day, the House reversed itself and permitted Veterans Affairs to transfer the money.</p>
        <p>Rebuffed in their efforts to prevent the Department of Veterans Affairs from sending money to aid in the lawsuit, Republicans in the House then tried to bar the Justice Department's receiving the money.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Waxman's amendment to a bill to finance the operations of the Commerce, Justice and State departments removed a provision that would have barred the Justice Department from receiving any money from any agency to help in the suit.</p>
        <p>''I think this settles the issue,'' Mr. Waxman said after the vote. ''I can't see how any other effort in any other legislation will succeed.''</p>
        <p>Republicans say, however, that they fully expect additional efforts to limit the money available to the Justice Department for its tobacco litigation. Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska, has inserted language in the Senate version of the spending bill for the Justice Department that prevents the transfer of funds for the suit.</p>
        <p>Republican efforts to restrict or eliminate financing for the lawsuit is one of several issues that have prompted President Clinton to threaten to veto the spending bill for the Commerce, Justice and State departments.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton has also objected to the amounts contained in the bill for programs like hiring more police officers, setting aside more land for national monuments and contributing to United Nations peacekeeping efforts.</p>
        <p>With such threats hanging over this spending measure and others, most lawmakers expect tough negotiations with the president as the fiscal year winds down in September. So far, the House has passed 9 of the 13 spending bills that must be enacted for the government to continue to function. The Senate has approved three.</p>
        <p>Today's action was the latest in a long series of skirmishes over the lawsuit filed by the Justice Department, which seeks to recover from tobacco companies the health care expenses of the departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs and Health and Human Services that are related to smoking.</p>
        <p>Last year the subcommittee that oversees the Justice Department refused to grant its request for a $20 million transfer from those three departments to help pay for the litigation.</p>
        <p>At the time, Representative Harold Rogers, a Kentucky Republican who heads the subcommittee, told Justice Department officials they should pay for the lawsuit out of their own operating funds.</p>
        <p>Attorney General Janet Reno has said repeatedly that without being able to use money from other agencies the Justice Department may not be able to advance the lawsuit.</p>
        <p>After being rebuffed by the subcommittee, the Justice Department unilaterally requested $8 million from the three departments without informing the panel, Mr. Rogers's office said.</p>
        <p>Justice Department officials justified their action by citing a 1995 law allowing the department to request Pentagon money to help defend the Navy in a suit brought by contractors for a jet fighter.</p>
        <p>As the subcommittee drafted spending bills to finance the Justice Department in the fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1, Mr. Rogers included a provision that prevented the department from once again asking the three other departments for financial help in pressing the lawsuit.</p>
        <p>Since the 1995 law was passed the Justice Department has made 21 requests for a total of $324 million from other agencies to help in lawsuits. In 17 of those cases, the Justice Department was defending agencies that were being sued.</p>
        <p>The tobacco suit is only the fourth case, and by far the largest, in which the Justice Department requested money for a suit in which the federal government is the plaintiff.</p>
        <p>On the House floor today, few Republicans spoke out in defense of tobacco companies.</p>
        <p>Instead, those who opposed Mr. Waxman's amendment said they believed the 1995 law merely permitted the Justice Department to use money from other departments to defend that department, not to file suits itself.</p>
        <p>''The statute is for defensive purposes,'' Mr. Rogers said. ''The government is not to sue willy-nilly.''</p>
