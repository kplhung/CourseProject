        <p>Citrix Systems Inc. said yesterday that its founder, Edward Iacobucci, had resigned as chairman in a management shake-up after a collapse in the share price of the company, a pioneering software group. Citrix, whose share price was nearly halved last week after executives cut profit forecasts, said it was bringing back Roger Roberts, a former chief executive, as chairman and was seeking a replacement for Mark Templeton, its chief executive. During the search for a new chief executive, Mr. Roberts, who was chief executive from 1990 to 1998, will be chief operating officer, the company said. Mr. Templeton will remain Citrix president. Citrix is based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.</p>
