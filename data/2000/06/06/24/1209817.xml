      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Vladimir A. Gusinsky, the media tycoon whose arrest last week raised fears of a press crackdown, refused to answer prosecutors' questions today.</p>
        <p>The prosecutors say Mr. Gusinsky helped defraud the government.</p>
        <p>He called the charges nonsense.</p>
        <p>As he did so, President Vladimir V. Putin met with security advisers to draft a national ''information doctrine,'' which Mr. Putin said would be rooted in total press freedom and the absence of censorship.</p>
        <p>The two counterpoints underscored the breadth of the gulf that separates the Kremlin and Mr. Gusinsky, a frequent critic whose businesses have come under growing government pressure. Mr. Gusinsky is apparently accused -- the state prosecutors' inquiry remains secret -- of swindling the state out of $10 million in his purchase of a television station in 1997 in St. Petersburg. He has said his holding company, Media-Most, poured nearly $5 million into what was a penniless business.</p>
        <p>The head of Mr. Putin's security council suggested that the Kremlin's view of a free press might not square with that of Mr. Gusinsky or other liberals. Mr. Putin was quoted as having told the council that ''without a free media, there is no free society.'' But the head of the council, Sergei B. Ivanov, said later that the council did not exclude creating an ''appropriate state mechanism'' to ensure support for the government.</p>
        <p>That hints at a new information agency, a prospect certain to alarm those who remember the Soviet Union's propaganda machine.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gusinsky said the government was trying to shoehorn the independent press into that role, saying the prosecution against him was intended to install a new head of Media-Most who would ''force journalists to tell stories about the grandness of our president.''</p>
        <p>His empire, which includes the lone independent television network in Russia, has been a frequent problem for the Kremlin and a sharp critic of Mr. Putin's policy on the Chechnya war. .</p>
