        <p>For a powerful politician seeking re-election to Parliament for the fifth time, Kazumi Mochinaga is a man of few words.</p>
        <p>With his campaign in full swing for the national election on Sunday, Mr. Mochinaga declines to give interviews, makes few public appearances and hardly ever gives political speeches in his conservative rice-growing district near the southern tip of the island of Kyushu.</p>
        <p>Instead, using a time-honored formula of his long-governing Liberal Democratic Party, Mr. Mochinaga, 76, a former Welfare Ministry official, long ago locked up the support of just about every major business and professional association in the region and is perfectly happy to let them campaign on his behalf.</p>
        <p>His sprawling campaign headquarters here, filled with banners of influential townspeople who have endorsed him and poster-sized testimonials from party bigwigs in Tokyo, seem intended to create a sense of crushing inevitability.</p>
        <p>Perhaps his glossy campaign poster best crystallizes the message to the voters, with its images of a bullet train, immaculate highways and a huge amusement center that will be host to some of the events of this summer's meeting of the world's leading industrial nations. With all of Kyushu's Liberal Democratic Party legislators arrayed around Mr. Mochinaga, the poster succeeds by boasting, ''Look what all of our years of government have brought you,'' without using any words.</p>
        <p>But this kind of campaign, along with the kind of politics that have produced it, are under attack across Japan as never before by opposition candidates who argue that an era of mammoth, politically driven public works spending has come close to ruining Japan.</p>
        <p>Many voters have also begun to say that however nice the old-guard politicians' promises may sound, Japan, with its seemingly intractable crisis of debt and stagnation,  must finally learn to say no.</p>
        <p>Although most opinion polls suggest another victory by the Liberal Democrats, the conservatives who have run Japan for all but two years since 1955, skepticism toward the government and its policies has rarely been so great.</p>
        <p>The cabinet of Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori has a popularity rating scarcely reaching the double digits, and many political analysts here say that the party's hold on the people is crumbling.</p>
        <p>A glimpse of the future is already on display in quiet, mountain-ringed towns like this one, where an insurgent campaign by a young independent candidate is giving Mr. Mochinaga the run of his life.</p>
        <p>The candidate, Yoshihisa Furukawa, is no policy radical. What the eager 34-year-old does promise, however, is a shakeup of the shadowy collusion between business and government that has been the Liberal Democratic Party's hallmark. Counting on his own seemingly boundless energy, he offers a new relationship between voters and politicians.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Mochinaga seems almost to sleepwalk through his campaign, Mr. Furukawa, limited only by the hoarseness creeping into his voice, wants to meet every voter.  ''He gets close enough to the electorate to feel their spittle on his face,'' one aide said.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Furukawa's campaign van goes from neighborhood to neighborhood, campaign workers intone an almost hypnotic message through the loudspeakers emphasizing his young age, his Internet address (www.393939.com) and a determination to ''fight to the end to resurrect Japan.''</p>
        <p>As they shout, Mr. Furukawa often leans clear across the vehicle, nearly climbing out of the driver's window to thank the women who come out of their houses to greet him, and constantly waves his sunburned left arm to the farmers who look up from rice fields momentarily, smile and bow.</p>
        <p>This energetic approach earned the challenger, then unknown, a respectable score when he took on Mr. Mochinaga in the last election, four years ago. Now the incumbent, by his own aides' admission, is running scared.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Furukawa is running as an independent, and that is a minus,'' said Kenichi Sugimura, an official in the Mochinaga campaign nostalgic for a simpler era when the instructions of an employer or a husband sufficed to make a whole family vote a certain way.</p>
        <p>''Our opponent has been campaigning ever since the last election, and such a grass-roots effort is a bit frightening,'' Mr. Sugimura said. ''It is impossible to know how much support he has.''</p>
        <p>But as frightening as Mr. Furukawa's method is for the incumbent, it is the message of candidacies like these, with their promise to break the bonds between business and government, that most threatens the Liberal Democratic Party</p>
        <p>''Mochinaga and so many other Diet members are like tribesmen, each representing their own favorite interest groups,'' said Mr. Furukawa, who works as an adviser to his parents' liquor business. ''They think their job is to suck money out of the government and spend it here. I believe we have to examine our fiscal problems honestly, and level with the people for once.''</p>
        <p>The straight talk is clearly working with a lot of voters here, especially, it seems, younger voters and women. ''In the past, Mochinaga was always very confident, but this race is too close to call,'' said Watanabe Makiko, 47, a homemaker. ''There are many things I'd like to see changed in this country, and Furukawa's campaign gives people hope.''</p>
        <p>While the opposition campaign has inspired hope in some quarters of the electorate, the incumbent retains some powerful assets.</p>
        <p>Foremost, perhaps, is apathy. Asked about the nearly 50 percent of the electorate that has expressed no preference in opinion polls, Prime Minister Mori, whose brief tenure in office has been marked by provocative comments, said he hoped they would ''just sleep'' on Election Day.</p>
        <p>Even more powerful in small towns like this, however, is fear.</p>
        <p>At a campaign event for Mr. Mochinaga, public child-  and nursing-care employees were virtually ordered by their superiors to turn out for the incumbent, whose four-minute speech was one of the longest of his campaign.</p>
        <p>Construction companies and other businesses have been made to understand that if they do not support Mr. Mochinaga, contracts will dry up and bidding opportunities will disappear.</p>
        <p>''Up until three months ago, business people used to invite Furukawa to their parties and weddings, but suddenly that all stopped,'' said Shinobu Fujita, a construction company executive who supports Mr. Furukawa. ''But then the word was passed around that if you were his supporter, you would be made to feel the pressure.</p>
        <p>''It is very hard to mobilize people under those circumstances. In Japan, we call that giving people something to think about.''</p>
