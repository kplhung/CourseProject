        <p>No one wants to come out against the public disclosure of fat-cat donors to political ad campaigns. That would be too embarrassing when the public is so disgusted with fund-raising abuses. So House Republican leaders have done what must have seemed like the next best thing. They want a disclosure requirement that is so inequitable and destructive of First Amendment rights that it cannot pass. Their scheme is to use this hopelessly defective legislation as a tool to prevent a serious, evenhanded disclosure measure from getting a fair vote, even though it has broad bipartisan support. Reformers must defy these leaders and stand up for real reform this week.</p>
        <p>At issue is the effort to stop a new breed of shadowy slush funds, created by elected officials and interest groups under Section 527 of the tax code, from raising and spending undisclosed sums for ad campaigns in elections. These groups have sprung up this year and, circumventing campaign disclosure laws, run anonymous attack ads like the one that smeared Senator John McCain during the primaries. That ad turned out to be paid for by supporters of Gov. George W. Bush, but others have spread across the airwaves with no one knowing who was paying for them.</p>

        <p>No one wants to come out against the public disclosure of fat-cat donors to political ad campaigns. That would be too embarrassing when the public is so disgusted with fund-raising abuses.

Their scheme is to use this hopelessly defective legislation as a tool to prevent a serious, evenhanded disclosure measure from getting a fair vote, even though it has broad bipartisan support.

        <p>At issue is the effort to stop a new breed of shadowy slush funds, created by elected officials and interest groups under Section 527 of the tax code, from raising and spending undisclosed sums for ad campaigns in elections. These groups have sprung up this year and, circumventing campaign disclosure laws, run anonymous attack ads like the one that smeared Senator John McCain during the primaries. That ad turned out to be paid for by supporters of Gov. George W. Bush, but others have spread across the airwaves with no one knowing who was paying for them.</p>
        <p>For years, Representative Tom DeLay and other foes of campaign fund-raising curbs have said that what is needed is more disclosure, not more limits on the fund-raising itself. Now Mr. DeLay, Dick Armey and Bill Archer, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, have come up with a disclosure bill that would apply to all sorts of activities, not just those in an election campaign. Moreover, the disclosure requirements for lobbying would be absurdly punitive toward unions. A labor group lobbying on a bill would have onerous disclosure requirements, whereas a corporation lobbying on the same bill would not.</p>
        <p>This badly drawn bill is to be voted on in the House next week. But an alternative is being prepared by several reformers of both parties, including Representatives Christopher Shays, Michael Castle and Martin Meehan and Senators McCain, Joseph Lieberman, Russell Feingold and Olympia Snowe. Republican leaders are suggesting they might not allow the bipartisan alternative to the floor. Their mechanism would be to offer a rule adopted by the Rules Committee, which is a tool of the speaker, allowing only one bill to be voted on, up or down -- the one that everyone knows has no chance of passing. This tactic is reminiscent of Speaker Newt Gingrich at his worst, when he tried and failed to stop a soft-money ban from being passed in the House two years ago.</p>
        <p>There has not been any meaningful campaign finance reform passed in Congress in many years. The battle has come down to something so elementary as to be beyond dispute: ripping the curtain of secrecy from fund-raising that the public thought it had outlawed back in the dark Watergate days. Lawmakers in the House must demand a chance to vote on real reform, not the sham bill that is being force-fed them by Mr. DeLay and his colleagues. To miss this opportunity will only deepen popular cynicism and make more scandals inevitable.</p>
