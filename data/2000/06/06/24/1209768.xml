        <p>The State Constitution required that it be released by this week, and the chairman of the Assembly Budget Committee had promised it for today, but New Jersey's budget for the coming fiscal year will not make an appearance until Monday at the earliest, legislative officials said today.</p>
        <p>''Technical difficulties'' was the reason staff members for the Republican majority gave for the failure to deliver the details of the $21.5 billion spending plan for the year beginning July 1.</p>
        <p>Legislative leaders got around the constitutional requirement that the budget be introduced in the week before next Thursday's final voting session by submitting the name and number of the budget bill around noon today.</p>
        <p>And instead of an actual budget, legislative leaders gave reporters a summary of $122 million in special gifts to constituents called grants-in-aid -- sometimes called ''pork'' -- of which $64 million was added by members of the Legislature on top of Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's list.</p>
        <p>These gifts to constituents include items like $25,000 for the Bergen-Lafayette Little League, $25,000 to a group called Women in Support of the Million Man March, $72,000 for a new ambulance for the Endeavor Emergency Squad of Burlington County, and $9,000 to restore the veterans' memorial in Nutley.</p>
        <p>''The Legislature has worked hard to ensure that the people of this state are the beneficiaries of the booming economy we are enjoying,'' said Senator Robert E. Littell, chairman of the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee.</p>
        <p>In all, the Legislature added $250 million to the budget proposal Governor Whitman made in January.</p>
        <p>The complete official budget, including crucial language on how the state intends to spend $420 million from the settlement of the suit against tobacco manufacturers, and details of aid to schools and cities, is scheduled to be voted out of committee in time for Thursday's final session.</p>
