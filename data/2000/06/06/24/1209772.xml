        <p>After spending five minutes at a press briefing following a breakfast with business leaders at the Waldorf-Astoria yesterday, Representative Rick A. Lazio bolted down 15 flights of stairs and into an elevator, a gaggle of reporters in pursuit.</p>
        <p>His aides scolded the handful who made it into the elevator as Mr. Lazio, the Republican Senate nominee, smiled wanly in the corner, tersely responding to a few more questions before racing for his car out front and heading, a staff member said, back to Washington.</p>
        <p>''Give him a break, guys,'' an adviser called out amid the commotion.</p>
        <p>The spectacle provided a glimpse into Mr. Lazio's first tough week since he won the nomination May 30. He has spent the week largely besieged by the news media, hungry for comment on a federal investigation into his lucrative securities trading; by his opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton; and by gay rights advocates angered that he is skipping a gay pride parade in Manhattan tomorrow. But Mr. Lazio has offered minimal public responses as he seeks to conduct Congressional and campaign business in Washington.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's campaign aides say that clearly they have seen better days but they do not think the wave of bad press and attacks by Mrs. Clinton -- in television advertisements and a news conference Thursday at City Hall -- will make a strong impression on voters. As they prepared for a campaign swing upstate over the next couple of days, they spoke of polls showing the race about even -- less than a month into his official campaign -- and Mr. Lazio's intention to strike at themes popular among voters, like high gas prices he will attribute to the Clinton administration's energy policies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio plans to speak out on the matter even though Mrs. Clinton has criticized him for missing a vote last week in the House that would have created a home heating oil reserve, an idea he championed months ago to lower heating bills. Mr. Lazio caught a plane to New York for campaigning instead. He also missed a news conference Thursday scheduled by House Republicans to call on President Clinton to take action on high gasoline prices. His aides said he was giving an interview.</p>
        <p>Although on the defensive, Mr. Lazio largely kept up an upbeat demeanor yesterday. After talking to the business leaders primarily about education, advocating things like at least one charter school for every academically poor district, Mr. Lazio walked into a hotel conference room to a crowd of two dozen reporters and stood in front of a bouquet of microphones. He then answered questions about a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation of his short-term windfall profit three years ago in the securities of a company controlled by campaign contributors. He reiterated his position that the inquiry, begun earlier this week, was politically motivated and said he did nothing wrong.</p>
        <p>''You know, I spoke to my wife last night about this,'' Mr. Lazio said. ''I was a little concerned when I spoke to her about how it would affect me. She's just terrific. She said, 'Listen, you know what? We're honest, decent people. I clean my own house. We work hard. We have nothing to be ashamed of. They're trying to drag you down into the mud; don't let them do it.' And I'm not going to let them do it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio seemed to struggle with standing tough while keeping his vow not to sound too negative.</p>
        <p>But it did not stop him from obliquely swinging at Mrs. Clinton. Asked if he thought the investigation was politically motivated, as his surrogates have been saying and Mr. Lazio himself said last week, he replied: ''I think it's fairly transparent. I think the Clinton camp is going to answer for itself. And I think the people of New York are going to judge her behavior.''</p>
        <p>It was a reminder that Mrs. Clinton faced a dose of unfavorable news herself this week, something Republican strategists said they feared would be lost in the coverage of the investigation of Mr. Lazio. New polls showed her tied with Mr. Lazio. And although Robert W. Ray, the independent counsel investigating the Clintons, said he would not charge Mrs. Clinton for her role in the firing of seven longtime White House employees in 1993, he suggested she was more involved than she has acknowledged. The employees were replaced by the Clintons' supporters and relatives from Arkansas.</p>
        <p>Zenia Mucha, the senior adviser to Gov. George E. Pataki and, informally, to the Lazio campaign, said that in any race ''you go up, you go down, you move on.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Mucha said, ''is having a much more difficult time, and what better way to mask it than with this probe?''</p>
        <p>Others said such rocky times -- whatever the genesis -- were inevitable in big races.</p>
        <p>''There has never been a successful New York public leader who did not have to go under the microscope and take the heat,'' said Adam Goodman, a former media adviser to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's Senate campaign. ''Rick Lazio has had a couple of things that put him in the hot seat, and I think he has done well.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio plans to campaign much of tomorrow and Monday in upstate New York, where, many people say,  the race will be lost or won. He will attack the fuel oil taxes that he says the Clinton administration should lift, and he will continue his effort to make himself better known.</p>
        <p>''Yes, we are still getting the campaign mechanism up to speed and he has to spend time in Washington,'' said Michael Murphy, Mr. Lazio's chief strategist. ''The Clinton campaign has stepped up its attack mechanism earlier than we thought, which is irritating. But since we view that act as a blunder, we think we are doing well and she is struggling.''</p>
