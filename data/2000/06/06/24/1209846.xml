        <p>The killing of a woman whose partly clothed body was found Thursday on a mattress in a vacant lot in Williamsburg, strangled with her sneaker laces, may be linked to the slayings of five other women in Brooklyn, the police said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The other bodies were found over the last 10 months on rooftops in Williamsburg, in apartments in Bedford-Stuyvesant, and, in one case, in a utility room beneath the Brooklyn ramp to the Williamsburg Bridge, the police said.</p>
        <p>Some common elements tie the slayings together. Detectives from the Brooklyn North homicide squad and the 90th and 79th Precincts in Williamsburg and Bedford-Stuyvesant are investigating them on the theory that they were committed by one person. But investigators said they did not have enough evidence to conclude that a serial killer was stalking the Brooklyn neighborhoods where the women were slain.</p>
        <p>''We are treating all of these homicides as possibly being linked,'' Police Commissioner Howard Safir said. ''We do not at this point know for sure that they are linked.''</p>
        <p>In all of the cases, the women were strangled, apparently with whatever the killer found at hand: two with their own sneaker laces, one with the drawstring from a pair of sweatpants, two with electrical cord and one with a piece of cloth, the police said. All the women had arrest records for prostitution or drug-related offenses and all were found nude or partly clothed, a senior law enforcement official said.</p>
        <p>None of the victims' bodies showed any signs that they had struggled with their killers.</p>
        <p>The killings are being investigated as a group, said Lt. Joseph Heffernan, who is overseeing the inquiry and heads the Brooklyn North Homicide Task Force, ''because of the similarities, in an effort not to get caught short, not to miss something.''</p>
        <p>But some things set the five deaths apart, he said. The victims ranged in age from 21 to 48 years old. Two were Hispanic, three were black and one was white. Detectives said they thought the killer had struck two of the women in the face.</p>
        <p>In the first three cases, one in August and two in September, DNA evidence recovered from the bodies suggested the same man had sex with the women before they were killed, but investigators do not have evidence that he killed them, according to the senior law enforcement official. Three of the women, including the most recent victim, were killed on Thursdays and a fourth, Rhonda Tucker, 21, who was found in her Bedford-Stuyvesant apartment on Sept. 25, a Saturday, was last seen alive on a Thursday.</p>
        <p>In the most recent case, the victim, Patricia Sullivan, 48, was found about 2:20 p.m. on Thursday in a vacant lot in Williamsburg, across from 28 Bartlett Street, the police said. She was seen walking earlier that day into the lot, which was overgrown with tall grass and strewn with garbage, with a man, but police were not sure whether he was her killer.</p>
        <p>The other victims were Vivian Caraballo, 26, who was found in the elevator room on the roof of the building where she lived on South Second Street on Aug. 26; Joanne Feliciano, 35, who was found on the roof of a South Fourth Street building on Sept. 16; Katrina Niles, 34, whose body was discovered inside her Marcy Avenue apartment on Oct. 4; and an unidentified 43-year-old woman whose body was found under the Williamsburg Bridge.</p>
