        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>A June 17 news article paints a frightening picture of residential life at Northfield Mount Hermon School in Massachusetts and, by implication, a negative picture of boarding schools throughout the country. I have a different view, based on a recent visit to Northfield Mount Hermon.</p>
        <p>Students told me about their caring and skillful dorm parents, counselors and teachers, about the supportive and stimulating residential life programs at the school, about high expectations and standards and friendship and fun. Visits to many other boarding schools reaffirm the belief that these schools have the rare ability to create inclusive communities, nurturing both intellectual growth and social development.</p>
