      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>After a long struggle to balance the need for expansion into suburban areas with the goal of keeping mass transit fares low for city residents, a $12 million deficit has forced public transit officials to make a choice, and they moved clearly in the direction of expansion.</p>
        <p>On Monday, the board of directors of the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority agreed to raise fares by 25 cents to finance the system's growth into the largely white northern suburbs. Marta officials say the $1.75 fare, which takes effect on Jan. 1, is needed to pay for two new rail stations opening in suburban north Fulton County. The increase is the first since 1995, and puts the cost of a flat fare at the upper end of urban transit systems around the country.</p>

        <p>After a long struggle to balance the need for expansion into suburban areas with the goal of keeping mass transit fares low for city residents, a $12 million deficit has forced public transit officials to make a choice, and they moved clearly in the direction of expansion.</p>
        <p>On Monday, the board of directors of the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority agreed to raise fares by 25 cents to finance the system's growth into the largely white northern suburbs. Marta officials say the $1.75 fare, which takes effect on Jan. 1, is needed to pay for two new rail stations opening in suburban north Fulton County. The increase is the first since 1995, and puts the cost of a flat fare at the upper end of urban transit systems around the country.</p>
        <p>The expanded rail and bus service is intended to relieve some of the region's notorious traffic congestion, along with a smog problem that has become one of the worst of any major metropolitan area.</p>
        <p>The addition of five new stations since 1995, special buses for the disabled, and the expansion of Marta's police force and station staff have forced the agency into the red in recent years, a Marta spokeswoman, Dee Baker, said.</p>
        <p>Though half the construction cost of the new stations was paid with federal funds, Marta relies for the rest of its money on fare revenue and a 1-cent sales tax from the city of Atlanta and the two counties where Marta service is concentrated. Marta receives no money from the state.</p>
        <p>''We are probably one of the only regions in the country that does not have a state transportation fund,'' Ms. Baker said, adding that this is unlikely to change in the near future. ''In the short term, the only real alternative to the fare increase would be a decrease in service.''</p>
        <p>The agency has considered cutting back on bus service instead of a fare rise but is not expected to change its decision before Jan. 1.</p>
        <p>Many riders and transit advocates in Atlanta argue that the fare increase unjustly targets the poorest residents of the city, who are the heaviest users of the system.</p>
        <p>Robert Bullard, head of an urban policy research group at Clark Atlanta University, says the fare increase favors the suburban, predominantly white ridership over low-income minorities in the city.</p>
