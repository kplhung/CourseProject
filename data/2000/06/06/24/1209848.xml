        <p>There is widespread feeling in Harrison, NY, that Albert J Pirro Jr, neighbor convicted on 34 counts of tax evasion and conspiracy, got what he deserved, both for his financial shenanigans and for derailing bright career of his wife, District Attorney Jeanine F Pirro; photos; map (M)</p>

        <p>Above the cash register at a dingy doughnut shop on Halstead Avenue here hangs a letter from Jeanine F. Pirro, thanking the proprietor for a $100 donation to the Westchester County Alliance Against Crime.</p>
        <p>It is a form letter, on Westchester County district attorney stationery, directed to ''Dear Sir or Madam.'' But it ends with a personal touch, a scrawled note from Mrs. Pirro saying, ''I am proud to be a Harrison resident.''</p>
        <p>Here in the Pirros' hometown today, people oozed sympathy for the district attorney, whom they saw as a victim of what they called the hubris and greed of her husband, Albert J. Pirro Jr., convicted Thursday on 34 counts of tax evasion and conspiracy. As for Mr. Pirro, there was a general consensus that he got what he deserved, both for his financial shenanigans and for derailing his wife's bright career.</p>
        <p>''The moral of the story is, keep your maiden name,'' said Gail Sheffler, an advertising copywriter who was at the counter in Harrison Donut, her attention divided by newspaper headlines about the Pirro conviction, her breakfast egg sandwich and her 8-year-old daughter and a friend.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sheffler, who was headed for a swim at the nearby Shenorock Shore Club, said she admired Mrs. Pirro, whom she called ''likable, efficient and spunky.''</p>
        <p>But she believes that Mr. Pirro, a real estate lawyer and county power broker, abused his position.</p>
        <p>''It's nervy when people like him think they're above the law,'' she said. ''If he was my husband, I'd kill him.''</p>
        <p>Harrison is a sprawling place, more than 20 square miles with a population of 27,000 -- not the sort of cozy village where everybody knows everybody else's name. So while newspapers with the banner headline ''Pirro Faces Prison'' were flying off newsstands here today, the Pirros were largely viewed as distant celebrities, not as neighbors or friends.</p>
        <p>Still, just about everyone interviewed today in downtown Harrison knew about Mr. Pirro's illegal tax deductions for 10 luxury cars, investigators in a paternity suit, furniture for a getaway in West Palm Beach, Fla., custom-made pen for a pair of potbellied pigs, cigars, artwork, private school tuition and servants at the family's Italianate home.</p>
        <p>None of these residents had ever passed through the $45,000 wrought-iron security gates on Beechwood Circle, which Mr. Pirro also claimed as a business expense.</p>
        <p>But the gates were not hard to imagine, so common are they in the newer estate neighborhoods here.</p>
        <p>''It's very 'in' to have one of those remote-controlled gates,'' said Flora Dominus, co-owner of Distinctive Yarns on Harrison Avenue. ''People don't know how to spend their money anymore. You have never seen such excess!''</p>
        <p>Her business partner, Gail Goldey, nodded agreement. ''Excess and terrible taste -- what a combination,'' she muttered. ''What's being built now with all this new money -- what's the word? It's unseemly.''</p>
        <p>Harrison, best known for its championship-caliber golf courses, has had more than its share of prominent residents, including Gov. Herbert A. Lehman, Amelia Earhart, John Barrymore and Whitelaw Reid, publisher of The New York Tribune. Tisches, Loebs and Bushes have made Harrison their home, and Martha Mitchell pitched camp in Suite 543 at the Westchester Country Club in the midst of Watergate.</p>
        <p>The town's stateliest homes, massive Tudor-style houses built by the famed Louis Bowman, are steps from the fairways at the country club, one of five private golf clubs in Harrison.</p>
        <p>Not far away are the new large tract houses, like the Pirros'. Small Cape Cods and two-family houses surround the train station, home to the descendants of the Italian immigrants who settled here.</p>
        <p>While real estate prices are sky high, taxes are low because dozens of international corporations, including Texaco, Seagram and PepsiCo, make their headquarters here, reducing the tax burden.</p>
        <p>And public amenities abound: dozens of tennis courts, several swimming pools, a zoo, three libraries and a boccie court.</p>
        <p>But the downtown is charmless, so the well-to-do shop and mingle in nearby Rye.</p>
        <p>While Mrs. Pirro sent thanks to the owners of Harrison Donut, a local institution, it is hard to picture her on one of the scarred leather stools. But that is where Leona Krasnansky, a retired schoolteacher, sat this morning.</p>
        <p>''It's a good example of why you should live your life ethically,'' she said. ''Wouldn't you be embarrassed to be in that position? Wouldn't you rather be broke?''</p>
        <p>Sitting with his son in a gazebo outside Town Hall, Ron Conway, a retiree, said he felt sorry for Mrs. Pirro, whom he called ''a wonderful person.''</p>
        <p>But he worried that Mr. Pirro, who was convicted along with his brother, would ''not be penalized as much as he should'' because he is ''such a powerful person.''</p>
        <p>The only real disagreement among  residents here was whether Mrs. Pirro knew about the years of tax evasion, a situation they compared to that of Geraldine A. Ferraro, whose  vice-presidential candidacy was tarnished by her husband's business practices.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Dominus and Mrs. Goldey, at the knitting store, began on opposite sides of the argument, since one handled the family finances and the other left them entirely to her husband, and thus knew from experience that ignorance was possible.</p>
        <p>But they eventually reached a consensus, which Mrs. Dominus summed up in a Yiddish expression that translates as, ''You make yourself not know.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Dominus said she assumed that Mr. Pirro's conviction would cripple his wife's career, but she hoped otherwise.</p>
        <p>''I'm very taken with her as an attractive, well-positioned woman on the way up,'' she said. ''I'm more interested in how this affects her than how it affects him.''</p>
