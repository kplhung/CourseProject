        <p>IT is time for New Yorkers to turn the other cheek, to embrace with open arms, to bestow a Big Apple welcome to John Loy Rocker, that renowned deep thinker and man of generous insights.</p>
        <p>While city officials fear that an appearance by Mr. Rocker with Atlanta on Thursday, when the Braves open a series at Shea Stadium, could result in mayhem, it is to the benefit of Mets fans to perform acts of kindness and civility to the left-handed relief pitcher.</p>
        <p>Now, in many circles, opinion on John Rocker is divided. Some believe him to be a moron. Others think that he is an idiot. It's a free country, and their analyses cannot be dismissed out of hand. After all, anyone who paints an entire city -- and entire subway cars, for that matter -- with one broad, incriminating brush, as Rocker did, may conceivably not be a candidate for the chair at Harvard for the study of enlightenment.</p>
        <p>But whether it's necessary to provide, as Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said he would, 450 to 500 police officers at Shea for the series -- in contrast to the normal complement of 45 -- is disturbing in more ways than one. And whether it's in the best interests of all concerned to construct a fence and plywood roof to the visitors' bullpen to protect Rocker from rowdiness, as the Mets are planning, is another point that should be thought through.</p>
        <p>The contention here is that if Mets fans truly want the best for their team, they should not greet Rocker by hurling boos and batteries at him for having made his now infamous pronouncement in a December issue of Sports Illustrated, which included: ''Imagine having to take the 7 train, looking like you're in Beirut next to some kid with purple hair, next to some queer with AIDS, right next to some dude who got out of jail for the fourth time, right next to some 20-year-old mom with four kids. It's depressing.''</p>
        <p>Whether or not you happen to be, say, some kid with purple hair, those statements by Rocker as well as sundry other xenophobic, homophobic and hirsute phobic remarks, may certainly be construed as offensive. Yet the record shows that ill treatment is no way to behave toward a man who could help the Mets, a team in profound need of assistance.</p>
        <p>Look what happened on Wednesday night, for example. Rocker was brought into the game against the Chicago Cubs in the ninth inning, with the Braves behind by 3-1. He came running full bore from the bullpen, as is his wacky wont. The hometown crowd of 44,698 at Turner Field gave him a rousing ovation. Gentleman John proceeded to walk four batters, hit another, allowed one hit, had no strikeouts and gave up five runs as the Braves went down to an 8-1 defeat.</p>
        <p>Remember, Mets fans, that after Rocker's suspension in the early part of this season for his intemperate remarks, he returned to roaring cheers. He was then so thrilled and excited, apparently, by this acceptance, that he pitched his way to the minors, unable to get the ball over the plate. Only recently, after injuries to their bullpen, did the Braves reluctantly recall Rocker. His earned run average is a gaudy 5.57.</p>
        <p>If you are a Mets batsman, this is a man you would be crazy not to want to face.</p>
        <p>The genesis of Rocker's remarks to Sports Illustrated came while the Braves were beating the Mets in the National League Championship Series last October. Rocker pitched in all six games, generally in tight situations. He gave up three hits in six and two-thirds innings, walked just two and struck out nine. He had two saves in the Braves' four victories. And an E.R.A. of 0.00. He said that Mets fans had spat on him, threw batteries at him and visited him with an assortment of other ungallant deeds. And then he went out and destroyed Flushing's darlings.</p>
        <p>It's obvious that the worse you act toward Rocker, the better he pitches. And the nicer you treat him, the lousier he plays. It doesn't take an expert in quantum physics to figure out what Mets fans must do to the good ol' boy Rocker.</p>
        <p>He had said recently, maybe adding insult to injury, that when he got to New York he was going to take the No. 7 train to Shea. I'd give him a seat.</p>
        <p>At the ballpark, I'd toss him a bouquet of flowers, the way they do opera singers and triple-lutz skaters. Lull him into a sense of bliss. Gentleness softens the soul and, more important, enfeebles the sinews in the soup bone.</p>
        <p>I'd probably stop short of a ticker-tape parade when Rocker comes to town. But if he pitches like a bum, I'd reconsider. If he performs like a champ again, then I'd go to Plan B: rotten tomatoes.</p>
