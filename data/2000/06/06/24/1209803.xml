        <p>''I still believe in the process and the system,''  Jeanine Pirro declared on Thursday, professing her hope that future appeals would overturn the conspiracy and tax evasion conviction a federal jury had just delivered against her husband, Albert Pirro Jr. Mrs. Pirro, the Westchester County district attorney, was speaking as the loyal spouse, who appeared almost every day during the four-week trial of her husband, an influential real estate lawyer and Republican fund-raiser.</p>
        <p>The trial focused relentless and unflattering attention on the Pirros' private lives and improper tax deductions on personal items like a Chinese rug for their home, a wrought-iron pen for their Vietnamese potbellied pigs, a Mercedes-Benz for Mrs. Pirro's mother, who lives in Elmira, and a portrait of their children that Mrs. Pirro wanted in time for a dinner party.</p>
        <p>But neither spousal loyalty nor the fact that she was not charged with any wrongdoing exempts Mrs. Pirro from having to address the serious doubts that have arisen regarding her fitness for her important law enforcement job. Testimony at the trial suggested that she either knew or should have known about the scheme to defraud the government of more than $400,000 by deducting the family's personal expenses as business write-offs. Now that the trial is over, the sharp-witted D.A. owes the public an explanation, with particulars, as to why she believes her behavior was proper.</p>
        <p>Among other things, Mrs. Pirro needs to explain her role in the complex financing of her own car, a 1989 Mercedes-Benz. Prosecutors alleged, and the jury apparently agreed, that it was a sham transaction designed to allow her to say she paid for the car although one of her husband's companies really footed the bill. She also needs to explain the use of company accounts to pay some of her political consultants as well as her habit over the years of sending personal bills to Mr. Pirro's office, which then paid and deducted them through his various businesses.</p>
        <p>It is tempting to see Mrs. Pirro, a capable prosecutor and rising political star, as a victim of her husband's mistakes. But that image collapses on recognition that Mrs. Pirro is a knowledgeable lawyer and former judge who signed some of the tax returns that figured in her husband's conviction. Moreover, she personally benefited from the cheating that subsidized her family's lavish life style. As a law enforcement official who is supposed to avoid even the appearance of impropriety, Mrs. Pirro surely had a responsibility at least as great as that of other taxpayers to ascertain that her personal and campaign expenses were being properly handled.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Pirro's involvement in her husband's tax problems, while not criminal, has cast a dark cloud over her personal integrity and judgment -- two essential qualities for a prosecutor.</p>
