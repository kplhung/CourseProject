        <p>A federal appeals court in Atlanta has refused to reconsider the case of Elian Gonzalez, leaving the United States Supreme Court as a last hope for the Miami relatives who want to prevent his return to Cuba.</p>
        <p>Unless the nation's highest court intervenes, a step considered unlikely, the 6-year-old and his father, who have been living in the Washington area while the legal appeals play out, would be free to leave for Cuba after 4 p.m. Wednesday, when an earlier extension expires.</p>
        <p>The 12 members of the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit not only denied the Miami relatives' request for a rehearing today, but they did not even call for a vote on the question.</p>
        <p>The relatives' lawyers, Judge J. L. Edmondson wrote in the unanimous opinion, should direct any requests for a further stay of the deadline to the Supreme Court. He said his court would not grant any future motions for a stay. He wrote the ''NOT'' in bold, oversized letters.</p>
        <p>Approval from 7 of the 12 court members was needed for a rehearing of the case, in which a three-judge panel ruled June 1 in favor of the government and, indirectly, Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez.</p>
        <p>Four of the nine Supreme Court justices must agree to hear an appeal, but a single justice can grant a stay, or refer the question about a stay to the full court. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy is the Supreme Court member assigned to hear emergency cases like this one. If he does not act on a stay, the father could legally put his son a plane for Cuba as early as 4:01 p.m. Wednesday.</p>
        <p>A lawyer for the Miami relatives, Spencer Eig, said the relatives would appeal and seek a stay of that deadline. ''We feel the future of a small boy is important enough to take to the highest court,'' Mr. Eig said.</p>
        <p>But legal experts say that a stay seems unlikely and that a friendly ruling for the Miami relatives, if the case is heard, is even more unlikely.</p>
        <p>''This is a pack-your-bags decision,'' said Pamela Falk, a professor of international law at the City University of New York who has argued similar cases. ''The legal issues are over. The family has exhausted every remedy. They had their day in court. They had many days.''</p>
        <p>In Washington, where Elian is living with his father, stepmother, half-brother and friends and teachers from Cuba, a lawyer for the father said the family had not decided when they would leave the country if the stay expired.</p>
        <p>The Gonzalez family, said Gregory B. Craig, the lawyer, ''looks forward to resuming a normal life.''</p>
        <p>Attorney General Janet Reno, who has been criticized for her handling of the case, said she was ''pleased that the appeals court had acted unanimously in denying the motion for rehearing.''</p>
        <p>''Now that the court has conclusively upheld our decision,'' Ms. Reno said, ''I am hopeful that this father and son will soon be able to move on with their lives together.''</p>
        <p>In their appeal, lawyers for Lazaro Gonzalez, a great-uncle of the boy in Miami, had argued that the three-judge panel was wrong to uphold an Immigration and Naturalization Service decision to return Elian to his father in Cuba.</p>
        <p>The three-judge panel had found that while the court might disagree with sending the boy back to a Communist government with a long, dismal history on human rights, the law gave wide discretion to the immigration agency in such cases and that the powers of the executive branch of government should be respected.</p>
        <p>''Since this case does not present a complicated legal issue, there is no reason to expect the Supreme Court to take interest in this appeal,'' said David Abraham, a professor of immigration law at the University of Miami.</p>
        <p>In Miami, where Lazaro Gonzalez kept the boy in his home after he was rescued at sea last November and until the armed federal raid reunited him with his father in April, people were disappointed, but there were no demonstrations.</p>
        <p>Outside the house where Elian had lived, which has become a shrine of sorts in the exile community, only a few people showed up to voice their displeasure.</p>
        <p>''We feel it's a case that is appropriate for the Supreme Court,'' Mr. Eig said. He said the relatives' lawyers would argue that Elian had constitutional rights to apply for asylum.</p>
        <p>But the Supreme Court is more likely to affirm the father's rights in the case, Ms. Falk said. ''It is so highly unlikely that the Supreme Court will grant even an emergency injunction.''</p>
