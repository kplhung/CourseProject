        <p>Three men in dark suits fired high-caliber weapons at a television reporter's car and at a second car with two bodyguards on Thursday night, the police said.</p>
        <p>The reporter, Lily Tellez, was on her regular route from work at TV Azteca to her house.</p>
        <p>She was not hurt.</p>
        <p>Ms. Tellez's driver and both bodyguards were hospitalized with bullet wounds. All three were listed in stable condition today.</p>
        <p>Today, the federal and city police forces announced a joint investigation into the shooting.</p>
        <p>The authorities cited suspicions that drug traffickers might have planned the crime.</p>
        <p>The federal police provided bodyguards for Ms. Tellez last year after she had reported on the narcotics trade here.</p>
        <p>More recently, Ms. Tellez had a dispute with District Attorney Samuel del Villar of Mexico City over his investigation into the slaying a comedian at TV Azteca, Francisco Stanley, last year. Mr. Stanley has also been linked to drugs.</p>
