        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I hope ''Africa's Swelling Refugee Crisis'' (editorial, June 17) increases awareness of this problem and the parsimony of the international response. The Clinton administration has made a deplorably inadequate budget proposal that would cut overseas assistance to protect African refugees by nearly $14 million.</p>
        <p>The administration would also continue the steady decline in resettlement admissions, reducing by up to 9,000 the number of refugees from around the world who would be able to start a new life in this country when returning to their own is not a viable option. Republican counterproposals threaten to cut refugee protection and resettlement even further.</p>

        <p>The writer is president of the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service.</p>
