        <p>Letter from Herbert Pardes, president and chief executive of New York-Presbyterian Healthcare System, commenting on June 17 article on plight of teaching hospitals, says US needs universal health care coverage to help both indigent people and the institutions that serve them; says teaching hospitals are central to maintaining the best American medicine</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>A June 17 news article reports that hospitals are ''reeling from federal spending cuts.'' I would take this further to say that academic medicine is in a perilous state.</p>
        <p>The United States has the finest combination of medical research, education and quality care, and advances in these areas are among the greatest accomplishments of the last century. But we need to strengthen public policy in terms of giving dedicated financial support to hospitals and medical schools.</p>

        <p>A June 17 news article reports that hospitals are ''reeling from federal spending cuts.'' I would take this further to say that academic medicine is in a perilous state.</p>
        <p>The United States has the finest combination of medical research, education and quality care, and advances in these areas are among the greatest accomplishments of the last century. But we need to strengthen public policy in terms of giving dedicated financial support to hospitals and medical schools.</p>
        <p>Academic medicine has been turned over to the marketplace and treated like a product. We need universal health care coverage to help both indigent people and the institutions that serve them. And elected officials need to understand that teaching hospitals are central to maintaining the best of American medicine.</p>
        <p>HERBERT PARDES, M.D.  President and Chief Executive  New York-Presbyterian  Healthcare System  New York, June 20, 2000</p>
