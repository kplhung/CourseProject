        <p>The old heroes sing liberation songs and predict an overwhelming victory for President Robert Mugabe and his ruling party. But one of the party's youth leaders smells trouble as he campaigns in poor villages.</p>
        <p>The leader, Ocean Mudzivo, has taken to searching funerals and festivals for converts because young people no longer flock to his political rallies. He talks of land and liberation, but the young say he belongs to the party of the past.</p>
        <p>''They ask: 'Why should we vote for you? We have no work and even you are doing nothing,' '' said Mr. Mudzivo, 39, who was imprisoned as a teenager for supporting Zimbabwe's independence struggle against white minority rule. Today, he works odd jobs and grows vegetables to survive.</p>
        <p>''I have no answer for them,'' he continued. ''I am a leader in my party, and I cannot give up on it. But the party will have to change.''</p>
        <p>This weekend Zimbabweans vote in parliamentary elections that will challenge the overwhelming dominance of President Mugabe's ruling party, the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front, for the first time in the country's 20-year history. And as Mr. Mugabe campaigned across the country today, he urged people to remember the past and to stay true to the party that helped liberate them from white rule.</p>
        <p>But the old message is being delivered to a changing nation.</p>
        <p>Today, about a third of the population consists of young people who were either children in 1980, when majority rule was achieved, or were born shortly after. And a significant percentage of the 5.8 million voters have registered since February, after the ruling party suffered its first major political defeat.</p>
        <p>Even within the ruling party itself, the generation gap is widening. For the first time, dozens of politicians have defected from Mr. Mugabe to run as independent candidates, many of them men in their 30's and 40's who see little future for themselves in a party still dominated by aging freedom fighters.</p>
        <p>And as voters cast their ballots at 4,000 polling places, many will ask themselves: Can the party of liberation transform itself into a party that addresses unemployment and corruption along with traditional issues of land redistribution and black empowerment? Or can people trust a new, untested opposition party that has gained popularity by promising honest government and an improving economy?</p>
        <p>There are still fears that the elections will be marred by violence or fraud. Tensions are high, and about 300 foreign observers and 30,000 local police officers are now stationed in 10 provinces. In the violent political campaign, at least 26 people were killed and more than 1,000 white farms invaded by black squatters.</p>
        <p>There is little doubt that Mr. Mugabe's government will cede some power to the new opposition.</p>
        <p>His party currently controls all but three seats in Parliament, but the opposition, the Movement for Democratic Change, is contesting all 120 seats that are up for election.</p>
        <p>And some officials acknowledge that they will likely lose their near-total grip on power, though they differ on how many seats will be lost.</p>
        <p>No matter what the result, prominent members of the party are already admitting that they will have to change their message and perhaps shuffle their ranks to appeal to a younger and increasingly urban population. ''The generation gap is the problem,'' John Nkomo, the campaign manager for Mr. Mugabe's party, said in an interview. ''The young people, the so-called born frees, haven't got the feeling I have, the humiliation I felt under white rule, the suffering I felt.''</p>
        <p>The party has already begun to address issues important to the disaffected.</p>
        <p>In recent months, the government began cracking down on corruption and publicizing the victories of young, reform-minded politicians in party primaries. Last week Mr. Mugabe, 76, acknowledged at a rally here that the nation was suffering from soaring inflation and joblessness, and he promised to re-introduce price controls.</p>
        <p>But party members fear the new approach may have come too late.</p>
        <p>It is not that the old ideals no longer resonate. People still speak proudly about how Mr. Mugabe expanded access for the entire population to schools and clinics during his first decade in power.</p>
        <p>Many share his bitterness at the legacy of British colonialism and white minority rule, which left the tiny minority in control of more than half of the country's fertile land and most of the economy. And many express deep misgivings about the opposition party's alliance with white farmers and business executives, who have not rushed to help resolve the economic and racial inequities in this country.</p>
        <p>''They can never win election, not when they are a stooge of the white man, not when they are there to defend the rights of the whites, the white settlers in a situation of social and economic balance,'' Mr. Mugabe told cheering supporters today as he attacked the opposition party.</p>
        <p>But for growing numbers of people, the worries about land and whites are overwhelmed by the frustration at the government's inefficiency, mismanagement and corruption in the face of a contracting economy.</p>
        <p>In the last decade, the percentage of people living in poverty has surged to more than 60 percent, from 40 percent. Wages have fallen to pre-independence levels. The government can no longer pay creditors, buy enough fuel or supply medicines to hospitals.</p>
        <p>Voter apathy has been one of the most vivid signs of public disengagement and discontent with what has become virtually a one-party state.</p>
        <p>In 1980, when blacks finally won majority rule, 84 percent of voters voted in national elections, according to the United Nations Development Program. In the last parliamentary elections, in 1995, that figure had fallen to 26 percent. And by last year, in local elections, the turnout plunged to 10 percent.</p>
        <p>''ZANU-PF pretends they're in touch with the people, but they're blind,'' said Albert Meke, 43, a politician who defected from the ruling party to run as an independent candidate in Chivi. ''Young people -- some of them are for the new opposition because they are unemployed and the M.D.C. is promising to address those issues,'' said Mr. Meke, who had been a member of the ruling party for decades and has served in Parliament for nearly two years.</p>

        <p>U.S. Diplomats as Observers</p>
        <p>WASHINGTON, June 23 (By The New York Times) -- A delegation of American officials will be allowed to monitor the elections in Zimbabwe, after the government apparently reversed its ban on accrediting diplomats based there, a State Department official said today.</p>
        <p>''We understand the government of Zimbabwe has agreed to accredit all resident diplomats in Zimbabwe, including U.S. diplomats, as official election observers,'' a State Department official said. ''This gives our diplomats the ability to enter polling places and counting centers.''</p>
