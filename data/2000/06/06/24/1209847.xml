        <p>Nearly $100 million worth of cuts in New York City taxes -- intended largely to benefit the middle class, the elderly and the poor -- failed to win approval from the State Legislature yesterday, because of a dispute over a $2 surcharge on hotel rooms.</p>
        <p>The apparent death of the tax-cut package infuriated Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone, who said late yesterday that he was ''befuddled'' as to why the state would not allow Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the City Council to control the city's finances.</p>
        <p>The tax package's defeat illustrated, once again, tension that has been brewing for more than a year between the speaker, a Democrat, and Democrats who represent New York City in the Assembly.</p>
        <p>''It is really a shame,'' Mr. Vallone said. ''It does not really make any sense.''</p>
        <p>Although the Legislature could not agree on some of the tax cuts New York City sought, it did endorse two major pieces of city tax-cut legislation: reducing the personal income tax and creating new incentives for businesses to move to boroughs other than Manhattan. Those two bills involve about $332 million in tax cuts. The changes in the income tax make it more progressive, so that rates for low- and middle-income taxpayers will decline more sharply than for those with high incomes. For a taxpayer who earns about $65,000 a year, the personal income tax savings would be worth slightly more than $200.</p>
        <p>But a third bill, authorizing six  changes in city law that would have cut taxes by $95 million, failed because the Senate and the Assembly adopted different versions. Both bodies have now adjourned, probably until next year.</p>
        <p>Both chambers agreed on five of the items, offering tax credits to senior citizens who rent their homes, to parents with child-care expenses, to first-time home buyers, to taxpayers who earn less than $30,500 a year and to certain types of small businesses. Collectively, those tax cuts were worth $76 million in the 2001 fiscal year.</p>
        <p>But Democrats in the Assembly objected to the sixth item, the elimination of a $2-a-night surcharge on hotel bills, saying that the cut, which would cost the city an estimated $19 million in the coming fiscal year, would benefit only out-of-towners.</p>
        <p>The Assembly Democrats were criticized by city officials last year for eliminating the commuter tax paid by people who work in New York City but live elsewhere, and used the arguments from that debate to decide the hotel tax issue.</p>
        <p>''How can you tell us a commuter tax cut is wrong, yet you want to eliminate a $2 hotel surcharge on the Waldorf-Astoria paid by people from Europe, California and Chicago,'' said Assemblyman Herman D. Farrell Jr., a Democrat from New York City who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.</p>
        <p>Mr. Farrell said that Assembly Democrats had told Mr. Vallone this week to withdraw the hotel-tax cut. Mr. Giuliani had initially proposed the elimination of the $2 hotel surcharge in January, with the Council reluctantly agreeing this month to endorse it, as part of an effort to reach a compromise on the entire tax-cut package.</p>
        <p>But city officials this week declined to modify their request, so the Assembly approved its own version yesterday, with the hotel tax removed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vallone, Mr. Farrell and John E. McArdle, a spokesman for the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, agreed yesterday that the differing bills in the two houses meant that the $95 million worth of cuts were, at least for now, dead, although they could be reconsidered if the Legislature goes back into session after Thanksgiving, as it has in some previous years.</p>
        <p>''We are disappointed that tax cuts along the lines proposed by the mayor and City Council were not approved,'' Mr. McArdle said. ''Unfortunately, the Assembly has prevented major new tax cuts from happening in New York City.''</p>
        <p>Even before the disagreement with the Legislature, there had been some doubt about whether the city could afford the entire package of tax cuts and still balance the 2001 fiscal year budget.</p>
        <p>Sunny Mindel, Mr. Giuliani's press secretary, would not comment yesterday.</p>
