        <p>In his most famous essay, written almost 30 years ago, the anthropologist Clifford Geertz dissected the ritual of a Balinese cockfight. In preparation for the fight, men would groom choice roosters, nurture them and coddle them. A villager would suggestively sit with a bird between his thighs, ''bouncing it gently up and down to strengthen its legs.'' And when the time came, a master craftsman would fit the bird's legs with razor-sharp spurs and send it into a 50-foot square ring, to slash another similarly equipped cock, while village men bet on which bird would slaughter the other. The owner of the winner would eat the loser.</p>
        <p>The sexual symbolism is far from subtle -- the Balinese word for cock means hero, warrior, lady killer, tough guy -- but there is more going on here. Mr. Geertz meticulously described the frenzied betting on the fight, how ''Balinese status hierarchy'' is reproduced in the battle and the way in which the Balinese revulsion at animal-like behavior (babies are not even permitted to crawl) is countered by this animalistic extravaganza.

        <p>In his most famous essay, written almost 30 years ago, the anthropologist Clifford Geertz dissected the ritual of a Balinese cockfight. In preparation for the fight, men would groom choice roosters, nurture them and coddle them. A villager would suggestively sit with a bird between his thighs, ''bouncing it gently up and down to strengthen its legs.'' And when the time came, a master craftsman would fit the bird's legs with razor-sharp spurs and send it into a 50-foot square ring, to slash another similarly equipped cock, while village men bet on which bird would slaughter the other. The owner of the winner would eat the loser.</p>
        <p>The sexual symbolism is far from subtle -- the Balinese word for cock means hero, warrior, lady killer, tough guy -- but there is more going on here. Mr. Geertz meticulously described the frenzied betting on the fight, how ''Balinese status hierarchy'' is reproduced in the battle and the way in which the Balinese revulsion at animal-like behavior (babies are not even permitted to crawl) is countered by this animalistic extravaganza. In a cockfight, he suggested, the Balinese display their culture.</p>
        <p>And the only way for a foreigner to understand that culture is to become immersed in its detail. This essay (in his classic collection, ''The Interpretation of Cultures'') was a demonstration of his anthropological philosophy: we come to understand another social universe through ''thick description.'' The point is not to discover unchanging universal principles but to unmask the particular. The Western anthropologist is a peculiar guest in an alien world, observing a performance while affecting the world he observes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Geertz's most recent collection of papers and lectures, written over the last two decades, makes the peculiarities of his profession still more pronounced. What, he asks, is anthropology really about? What is to be made of Nayar matrilineal society, Aztec sacrifice and Hopi forms of speech, let alone cockfights? Isn't the anthropologist doomed to misinterpret another culture? Is any universal judgment possible? Anthropologists, Mr. Geertz writes, are ''merchants of astonishment,'' who constantly undermine any generalizations.</p>
        <p>So the anthropologist stands at a troubled crossroads -- a place where, it turns out, many contemporary political battles also play themselves out. In one direction is the world of culture, diverse and unimaginably complex. In the other is the world of nature, immutable and universal.  And though Mr. Geertz has now spent many years on the faculty at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, his career has been spent following one path while trying to hold the other in view.</p>
        <p>In keeping with his allegiance to the world of culture, where absolutes do not apply, Mr. Geertz quotes Montaigne: ''Each man calls barbarism whatever is not his practice.'' His idea of ''thick description'' doesn't only describe anthropology's possibilities, it also limits those possibilities. Anthropology is particular, never more.</p>
        <p>The path he does not take leads to a very different world, where universals are possible, where there is such a thing as human nature and where there may even be moral standards that allow one culture to judge another -- to condemn, say, human sacrifice or ritual clitorodectomies.</p>
        <p>The central essays of this book attack such positions. Some anthropologists, Mr. Geertz suggests, place ''morality beyond culture and knowledge beyond both.'' But he argues that there is absolutely no evidence supporting universalism. In one piece, ''The State of the Art,'' Mr. Geertz declares: ''Any sentence that begins, 'All societies have,' is either baseless or banal.'' In another, ''Anti Anti-Relativism,'' based on a 1985 lecture, Mr. Geertz turns sarcastic and fiercely polemical, hinting that universalistic declarations easily lead to absolutist condemnations like ''the poor are worthless'' or ''blacks are subhuman.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Geertz exaggerates the positions of his opponents to score points. Just because bad judgments about morality are possible doesn't mean judgments about morality are impossible. Sometimes he seems to recognize this. He calls his lecture ''Anti Anti-Relativism'' because while he tends to support relativism, he is not fully comfortable with postmodern relativism, in which almost no judgments are valid and even anthropology begins to seem an impossible undertaking.</p>
        <p>Mr. Geertz's quasi-relativism, though, leads to other problems. He describes a cultural dilemma: an American Indian is waiting for a dialysis machine, but the white middle-class doctors don't want to put him high on the list because he is an alcoholic. The Indian asserts his people's troubled past and his right to drink; the doctors assert their right to set social priorities. What is to be done? The relativist would say there is no way to judge between the two claims. But Mr. Geertz urges a kind of mutual understanding. ''If we wish to be able capaciously to judge, as of course we must, we need to make ourselves able capaciously to see.'' Yet eventually the judgment must be made, and isn't that an assertion of standards favoring one right over another? In fact, in the midst of Mr. Geertz's thick descriptions, all sorts of assumptions are made about the anthropologist's ability to render objective judgments.</p>
        <p>One result is an uneasy ambivalence. Mr. Geertz wants to resist the clutches of either party, but this doesn't necessarily make him right, only representative of his profession. For the troubled crossroads marks precisely the place where anthropology was born, and where it still dwells.</p>
        <p>Anthropology is a distinctly Western enterprise. As far as I know, no other culture has ever undertaken a systematic understanding of the world's various societies. It was an enterprise that arose partly out of a notion of universal law -- finding principles that would apply across all times and all cultures. But if all human life shares certain principles, then it becomes difficult for any one society to assert claims of innate superiority. Western universalism gives birth to Western relativism. So anthropologists have ended up thrashing about between the worlds of universalism and relativism. And the rest of us stand on the sidelines, frenziedly betting.</p>
