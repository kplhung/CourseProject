        <p>By a one-vote majority, the Los Angeles City Council approved $4 million today to bail out the local host committee for the Democratic National Convention here, assuring enough cash to begin building the stage at the Staples Center next month and avoiding a big political embarrassment for Mayor Richard J. Riordan.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Riordan's victory came at a personal price: $1 million, to be exact.</p>
        <p>That is because the Council required that several million-dollar letters of credit held by the Democratic National Committee from a group of wealthy civic leaders backing the convention must be cashed before any of the new city money is spent.</p>
        <p>One of those letters has Mr. Riordan's signature.</p>
        <p>In an even more bitter twist, the bailout could not muster a majority from the 15-member Council's 12 Democrats, and Mr. Riordan, a Republican who helped to lure the convention in the first place, had to rely on a liberal Democrat, Jackie Goldberg, a frequent antagonist in the Council, to pass it.</p>
        <p>Ms. Goldberg, who represents Hollywood, called the vote the hardest of her career and agreed to support the grant only after the Council accepted her amendments on the letters of credit, as well as a requirement that Pershing Square in the heart of downtown Los Angeles be available for public protests.</p>
        <p>Civil liberties groups have criticized a plan to limit protests to a fenced-off area set aside near the Staples Center.</p>
        <p>Ms. Goldberg's amendments also required the Police Department to meet with an ad hoc Council committee before and during the convention to avoid any police overreaction to protests.</p>
        <p>''Jackie made it really clear she would vote no,'' said her chief of staff, Sharon Delugach, who expressed surprise that the councilwoman's conditions had been met, especially those involving the police and protesters.</p>
        <p>From the beginning, the convention has been dogged by fund-raising difficulties, chiefly because the local organizers agreed to finance the $35 million cost almost entirely from private money, as organizers of the 1984 Olympics here did.</p>
        <p>The city originally agreed to provide transportation and security services amounting to about $7 million, but estimates of those costs have risen and earlier this week the Council approved $2 million more.</p>
        <p>But it balked at a request for an additional $4 million to jump-start construction work, with members insisting that would violate their original promise to taxpayers.</p>
        <p>Today, the measure passed 8 to 5, the bare majority needed in the 15-member body; two members were absent.</p>
        <p>Ben Austin, a spokesman for the local host committee, said the group was ''thankful that the Council expanded its partnership.'' Mr. Austin said the investment would help reap $135 million in economic activity for the city.</p>
        <p>Despite the troubles, the host group has raised a record amount in private cash and services, $25 million, and hopes a Sunday morning fund-raiser at Mr. Riordan's house, featuring President Clinton, will raise more than $1 million toward about $3 million in cash that is still needed.</p>
