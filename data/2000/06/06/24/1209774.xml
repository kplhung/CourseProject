        <p>As the new archbishop of New York, Edward M. Egan oversees a network of 17 Catholic hospitals and medical centers. But when he undergoes surgery on a knee next month, the archbishop will return to his former diocese in Bridgeport, Conn.</p>
        <p>The archbishop has postponed what a spokesman for the archdiocese described as a ''minor procedure'' since last fall, when his orthopedist in Bridgeport first recommended surgery. The spokesman, Joseph Zwilling, said the surgery was unrelated to an incidence of polio when Archbishop Egan was a child.</p>
        <p>The archbishop has declined to name the hospital where the surgery will be performed, or to detail its nature. Though the archbishop -- a tall, commanding figure -- has a limp, it was not known if that was related to the scheduled surgery.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zwilling said the archbishop meant no slight to the Catholic hospitals of New York by returning to Bridgeport for medical treatment. ''That's where the doctor is who's been treating him all through this,'' Mr. Zwilling said. ''It's mainly a condition of feeling comfortable with the orthopedic doctor who recommended the surgery.</p>
        <p>''He was just waiting for a time it would not interrupt his schedule, not realizing that come the spring, he would become archbishop of New York.''</p>
        <p>Last year, as Cardinal John O'Connor struggled with brain cancer, he bypassed the archdiocese's Catholic hospitals for treatment at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. The cardinal died on May 3 and Edward Egan was named to succeed him as head of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York. He officially became archbishop on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zwilling said that Archbishop Egan's surgery would take place in the second half of July. Next week, the archbishop will travel to Rome. On June 29, the feast day of SS. Peter and Paul, he will receive the pallium, a white woolen stole with black crosses that falls over the shoulders and symbolizes the unity of metropolitan archbishops with the Pope and their spiritual continuity with the line of St. Peter.</p>
        <p>The archbishop, a canon lawyer who served more than 20 years at the Vatican, will return to New York on July 4.</p>
