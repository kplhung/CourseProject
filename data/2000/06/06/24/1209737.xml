      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>In the role of band leader, the drummer Brian Blade works with two useful aesthetic tools: innocence and experience. His compositions, some of which use parallel chords and open harmonies that make them sound as if they're written on the guitar, stand apart from mainstream jazz -- the field in which Mr. Blade began his career behind musicians like Joshua Redman and Kenny Garrett. As heard on his new record, ''Perceptual'' (Blue Note/ EMI), they're hymnlike semi-pop tunes with improvisation, using dreamy drones and sentimental themes recalling the work John Coltrane produced out of his religious conviction.</p>
        <p>There's a protected naivete about the music. But the members of his band, which (in a gesture of semi-religious self-effacement entirely consistent with his art) he calls the Brian Blade Fellowship, include fluid virtuosos like the guitarist Kurt Rosenwinkel and the saxophonist Myron Walden. There's nothing naive about the way the music is played.</p>

        <p>In the role of band leader, the drummer Brian Blade works with two useful aesthetic tools: innocence and experience. His compositions, some of which use parallel chords and open harmonies that make them sound as if they're written on the guitar, stand apart from mainstream jazz -- the field in which Mr. Blade began his career behind musicians like Joshua Redman and Kenny Garrett. As heard on his new record, ''Perceptual'' (Blue Note/ EMI), they're hymnlike semi-pop tunes with improvisation, using dreamy drones and sentimental themes recalling the work John Coltrane produced out of his religious conviction.</p>
        <p>There's a protected naivete about the music. But the members of his band, which (in a gesture of semi-religious self-effacement entirely consistent with his art) he calls the Brian Blade Fellowship, include fluid virtuosos like the guitarist Kurt Rosenwinkel and the saxophonist Myron Walden. There's nothing naive about the way the music is played.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blade opened his first-ever week at the Village Vanguard on Tuesday, and his band was missing one of the crucial elements that give his records a swelling texture and a warm, major-ke Americana: the pedal-steel guitarist Dave Easley.  This gave more room to the commanding Mr. Rosenwinkel, on electric guitar; within five minutes after the beginning of the late set, the six musicians found that place that jazz players call ''the zone.'' Sustaining the intensity of their efforts, a few of them were screaming as they played.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blade creates depth, no matter whom he's performing behind. (In the last few years that has included high-profile pop stars like Joni Mitchell and Seal, as well as members of the New York jazz underground like Dave Berkman, Sam Yahel and Mark Turner.) He plays with an exaggerated slowness, making the music malleable; when he hits his crash cymbal, it's a meaningful fraction of a second later than you expect to hear the sound. He almost never resorts to typical four-beat jazz patterns, preferring the unmoored waves of triplets in Elvin Jones's vocabulary and the voluptuous, shuffling rhythms of 1970's funk.</p>
        <p>The band played not only Mr. Blade's music, but also tunes by Mr. Walden and the pianist Jon Cowherd.  All of it shared a kind of emotional hypersensitivity. The pieces began shyly and worked up to powerful outpourings in which the band came into itself: through the choral effect of Mr. Walden and Melvin Butler playing saxophone lines together; through Mr. Rosenwinkel's articulate lyricism; and through improvised trio passages involving Mr. Blade, the bassist Chris Thomas, and an open role for one other band member.</p>
        <p>It grew almost unbearably intense. It was personal music, and on occasion extremely powerful. The band plays through tomorrow night at the  Vanguard in the West Village.</p>
