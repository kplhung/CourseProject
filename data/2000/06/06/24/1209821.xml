        <p>Call it a case of Internet expediency or detente in cyberspace. An odd thing is being beamed from City Hall. Yesterday, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced the merger of the city's main Web site with those of his  primary rivals in city government, the City Council, the public advocate and the city comptroller.</p>
        <p>The new site address, which advisers to the mayor said was chosen for its simplicity, is www.nyc.gov. It succeeds www.nyclink.org, created last  year, and nyclink.org's predecessor, www.ci.nyc.ny.us, created in 1995, which had become a compendium of Internet information.</p>

        <p>Call it a case of Internet expediency or detente in cyberspace. An odd thing is being beamed from City Hall. Yesterday, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced the merger of the city's main Web site with those of his  primary rivals in city government, the City Council, the public advocate and the city comptroller.</p>
        <p>The new site address, which advisers to the mayor said was chosen for its simplicity, is www.nyc.gov. It succeeds www.nyclink.org, created last  year, and nyclink.org's predecessor, www.ci.nyc.ny.us, created in 1995, which had become a compendium of Internet information.</p>
        <p>The city page provides options ranging from restaurant inspection reports to an online system for paying parking tickets, all brought to you by the Office of the Mayor.</p>
        <p>Although the content of the mayor's site has not been changed, it now also offers links to the sites of the other government branches in the form of prominently displayed icons. With a mere double-click from the city's home page, users can switch to, say, instructions on how to sue the city, provided by Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, or a summary of Public Advocate Mark Green's scathing criticism of Mr. Giuliani's response to the police shooting of Patrick Dorismond.</p>
        <p>If this seems likely to incite political conflict within a Web page, several city officials said that was outweighed by the technical advantages of nyc.gov. They point out that the sites for the Council, Mr. Green and Mr. Hevesi had been provided on nyclink.org, although only to those willing to scroll through a complicated listing of city agencies.</p>
        <p>The new site's creation is known to have hinged on difficult negotiations with Mr. Green, since his staff registered the nyc.gov domain name in 1993 for use by the public advocate. Aides to both the mayor and Mr. Green said that site was coveted by both because its address is simple.</p>
        <p>''There is not a lot of intrigue in this,'' said Steve Sigmund, a spokesman for Mr. Green. ''It is obviously to everyone's advantage to have a single, well-organized city page that people will turn to intuitively.''</p>
        <p>Still, the announcement of the new Web site provided the latest evidence of thawing relations between Mr. Giuliani and three of his strongest political rivals, which has been evident since the mayor announced his diagnosis of prostate cancer and withdrew from the Senate race last month. Mr. Green, Mr. Hevesi and the City Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone, have been almost constant critics of the mayor for years, and all are Democratic candidates to succeed him in 2002.</p>
        <p>''This probably would not have happened a year ago,'' an aide to the  mayor said. ''It probably is another sign of detente,'' another city official said.</p>
        <p>Such warming relations -- at least between the mayor and Mr. Green -- were apparent yesterday in the way the new Web site was announced.  Both took responsibility and credit for the site in a shared press release,  their first since 1995. ''This is only the first step toward making the Internet's ease, speed and focus on consumer service a permanent feature of city government,'' Mr. Green said in the release.</p>
        <p>But if it becomes a permanent feature of city government, the new site also promises to provide an enduring forum for partisan politics.  That is because the rivals joining Mr. Giuliani with their own icons on nyc.gov have designed messages to foster their own ambitions.</p>
        <p>There are, for example, the smiling photographs of Mr. Green, Mr. Vallone and Mr. Hevesi, now just a double-click away from the nyc.gov home page. Behind Mr. Hevesi's face, and below that of Mr. Green, are lengthy descriptions of their resumes and accomplishments.</p>
        <p>The City Council site is designed somewhat differently, providing Mr. Vallone a forum for a policy statement on whatever question facing city government he chooses. Yesterday, the message condemned the work of the city's School Construction Authority, an agency that was praised on Wednesday for improved performance, perhaps not coincidentally, by the mayor.</p>
