        <p>Why have real animals -- clothed, splattered, slaughtered and hatching -- become players in the art world? These days it seems that every contemporary art exhibition must have its animal, dead or alive.</p>
        <p>At the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art in North Adams, the centerpiece of an exhibition called ''Unnatural Science'' is ''Misfit (St. Bernhard)'' by Thomas Grunfeld. It is the head of a sheep seamlessly attached to the body of a dog. Get it? Sheepdog.</p>
        <p>For the Whitney Biennial this year,  Yukinori Yanagi, a Japanese-born conceptual artist, created two pieces with the help of some ants. For one, Mr. Yanagi assembled a replica of Jasper Johns's ''Three Flags'' by pouring red, white and blue sand into three Plexiglass boxes. Then he poured in live ants, inviting them to tunnel through the sand. As the ant farm got busy, the flag began to collapse.</p>
        <p>In February at the Trapholt Art Museum in Denmark, Marco Evaristti displayed 10 goldfish, each swimming in its own blender, and viewers were allowed, if they wanted, to turn on a blender and frappe a fish. ''Two fish were blended at the opening,'' The Associated Press reported, ''and police ordered the blenders' plugs pulled after a local group, the Union for the Protection of Animals, complained.'' The museum's director, Peter Meyer, said five more fish were blended on the weekend after the opening.</p>
        <p>And of course there is Mr. Animal himself, Damien Hirst. At the ''Sensation'' show in London and Brooklyn, Mr. Hirst presented numerous animal corpses, including: a shark in formaldehyde (''The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living,'' 1991); a whole cow cross-sectioned and fitted into plexiglass cases (''Some Comfort Gained From the Acceptance of the Inherent Lies in Everything,'' 1996); a pig on a rail, sliced the long way so viewers could see the insides from snout to tail (''This Little Piggy Went to Market, This Little Piggy Stayed at Home,'' 1996).</p>
        <p>The use of live and dead animals in art has a history, and the history begins in Surrealism. Go back to 1938, when Salvador Dali made ''Rainy Taxi'' for the lobby of the International Exposition of Surrealism at the Galerie Beaux-Arts. Inside the car were two mannequins, one covered with live snails from Burgundy that fed on nearby lettuce and vines watered by rain falling from the ceiling.</p>
        <p>Twenty years later, larger fauna came into the picture. There was Robert Rauschenberg's angora goat encircled by a tire (''Monogram,'' 1955-59). Hermann Nitsch disemboweled and tore apart a dead lamb in Germany in 1962 (''The Orgies Mysteries Theater'').</p>
        <p>In Germany in 1965, Joseph Beuys lectured earnestly to a dead hare (''How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare''). A decade later he came to America and caged himself for a week with a live coyote (''Coyote: I Like America and America Likes Me,'' 1974). In 1969, Jannis Kounellis tethered 12 live horses to the wall of a gallery in Rome (''Horses''). A few years later, Annette Messager was outfitting dead sparrows with small wool sweaters -- pink, yellow and blue -- that she had knitted herself (''Boarders at Rest,'' 1972).</p>
        <p>What does it all mean? Well, there are some things you can say. Artists have favored certain animals -- lambs, horses, dogs, bunnies, birds and insects. They have tended to give their animal works fancy titles, with the same themes cropping up again and again -- sacrifice, sex, death, control, possession, abjection. Still, it is impossible to generalize. The explanations that artists, critics and curators provide are as numerous as the works of art.</p>
        <p>Start with Mr. Rauschenberg's goat in the tire. The critic Robert Hughes, who nicknamed it ''The Satyr in the Sphincter,'' thought it was an emblem of nature caught in culture's web and also an insignia of homosexuality: the priapic animal, he observed, had pushed its way into a giant orifice. The critic Arthur Danto saw the goat as a sacrificial animal ''wreathed with laurel when led to the altar.'' Leo Steinberg, in ''Encounters With Rauschenberg,'' called it Rauschenberg's act of possession: ''As the artist would encircle a car key with paint, and a bicycle with neon tubing, so here,'' Mr. Steinberg wrote, he circled the goat and ''made it private.''</p>
        <p>Beuys and his dead bunnies and live coyote have also provoked talk, particularly from Beuys himself. After he performed ''The Chief,'' a work in which he rolled himself in a blanket that was plugged up at each end with a dead hare, Beuys was asked whether he considered himself ''the chief of the animals.'' He responded, ''Yes, I speak for the hares that cannot speak for themselves.''  He added, ''I would like to elevate the status of animals to that of humans.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Nitsch said that his mutilation of a dead lamb was a way of taking ''upon myself the apparently negative, unsavoury, perverse, obscene, the passion and the hysteria of the act of sacrifice so that YOU ARE spared the sullying, shaming descent into the extreme.''</p>
        <p>Less grandiosely, the philosopher Peter Singer said the presence of animals in some art seemed intended to drive home an injustice: ''We know that animals are close to us, evolutionarily, genetically. But we still haven't changed the way in which we use them for food or research.'' Take the fish in blenders. ''When you give people the option of turning the blender on,'' Mr. Singer said, ''you raise the question of the power we do have over animals.''</p>
        <p>Others see irony. Steve Baker, a lecturer in historical and critical studies at the University of Central Lancashire in England, argues that many of these artists seem bent on creating a ''postmodern animal,'' to show that animals are to some degree human constructions.</p>
        <p>These new pastiche creatures ''may or may not incorporate living animals,'' he writes in ''The Postmodern Animal.'' In any case, it doesn't quite matter, because living animals these days ''are arguably being 'made' in the factory farm and in the scientists' laboratory just as much as in the poststructuralist philosopher's text or the postmodern artist's studio.''</p>
        <p>With Dolly, the cloned sheep, the time of the postmodern animal may have arrived in science. And if that is the case, artists are prepared. Mr. Baker considers Mr. Rauschenberg's goat in a tire, Mr. Grunfeld's mismatched taxidermy and William Wegman's dog dressed up as a bug-eyed, flippered frog (''Frog/Frog II,'' 1982) to be ''botched'' animals. And botching, he notes, is not all bad. It is a creative procedure. It is ''reverse butchery.''</p>
        <p>But perhaps the final word on animal art belongs to Robert Storr, a senior curator at the Museum of Modern Art, who suggests that the use of animals has followed a general ''shift to literalism.'' By the 1960's a painting was just paint and canvas. Sculpture went the same way. A steel box was a steel box. A stone was a stone. There was a leaning toward ''quiddity,'' he said, toward the ''itness'' of material. So what does that mean for animals in art? An animal, Mr. Storr says, is ''not a style, a movement, a tendency.'' And an animal is definitely not a new medium.</p>
        <p>Even in a museum, sometimes an animal is just an animal.</p>
