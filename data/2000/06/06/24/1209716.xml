        <p>The ballet season continues to offer different, sometimes unexpected debuts. After Maxim Belotserkovsky injured himself in rehearsal, William Marrie from the National Ballet of Canada appeared as a surprise guest, partnering Irina Dvorovenko for her debut in American Ballet Theater's ''Taming of the Shrew'' on Wednesday afternoon. In the evening, New York City Ballet presented Jennie Somogyi in ''The Cage,'' where she took on Jerome Robbins's man-hating Novice for the first time.</p>
        <p>Mr. Marrie, who had never danced with Ballet Theater or Ms. Dvorovenko before, found an intense, mutual rapport with his ballerina at the Metropolitan Opera House. Each paid special attention to the acute timing in John Cranko's choreographed pratfalls and to the acrobatics of the difficult duets. In this adaptation of Shakespeare's comedy, the temperamental Katherina often flips over Petruchio's shoulder to wind up sitting on the back of his neck.</p>

        <p>The ballet season continues to offer different, sometimes unexpected debuts. After Maxim Belotserkovsky injured himself in rehearsal, William Marrie from the National Ballet of Canada appeared as a surprise guest, partnering Irina Dvorovenko for her debut in American Ballet Theater's ''Taming of the Shrew'' on Wednesday afternoon. In the evening, New York City Ballet presented Jennie Somogyi in ''The Cage,'' where she took on Jerome Robbins's man-hating Novice for the first time.</p>
        <p>Mr. Marrie, who had never danced with Ballet Theater or Ms. Dvorovenko before, found an intense, mutual rapport with his ballerina at the Metropolitan Opera House. Each paid special attention to the acute timing in John Cranko's choreographed pratfalls and to the acrobatics of the difficult duets. In this adaptation of Shakespeare's comedy, the temperamental Katherina often flips over Petruchio's shoulder to wind up sitting on the back of his neck.</p>
        <p>Ms. Dvorovenko's dynamism defined her spirited heroine; Every arrow-sharp jete added to the brio of her comic acting. When she discovered love in the hammerlock that doubled as an embrace, her face registered the passage of newfound emotions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Marrie turned a cardboard role into a major one; his Petruchio was complex, with stretched-out phrases of movement that suddenly changed direction or tempo, the equivalent of asides to the audience. This was great dance acting that had a rarely seen maturity. His technique, if initially soft, exploded into speed and bravura by the end.</p>
        <p>It was a triumph for both principals, with good work coming from the ensemble in Cranko's Elizabethan-style dances in the ballroom scene and in Sean Stewart's fine comic portrait as a precious new Hortensio.</p>
        <p>Later, at the New York State Theater, Ms. Somogyi was perhaps too aggressive from the start as the Novice inducted into an insectlike sisterhood. Yet her strong projection added to the wonderful sensuality she and Kipling Houston gave to their dark encounter.</p>
