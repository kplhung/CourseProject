        <p>On the eve of the entry draft for amateurs, the focus today was on a significant arbitration decision that cost the Devils a former first-round draft choice but added to their stash of picks on Saturday.</p>
        <p>The case involved Mike Van Ryn, a defenseman who was 19 years old and playing for the University of Michigan when the Devils drafted him two years ago in the first round. Van Ryn never signed with the Devils and spent one more year at Michigan before moving to play junior hockey for Sarnia of the Ontario Hockey League.</p>
        <p>The Devils declared him a ''defected'' player under what they said were the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement. The defected status would have kept Van Ryn's rights with the Devils, as if he had decided to turn professional in Europe. Van Ryn and the N.H.L. Players Association countered by saying that he should not be classified as defected but rather should be an unrestricted free agent. The arbitrator, Lawrence Holden, sided with the union and against the league.</p>
        <p>As a result, Van Ryn can sign with any of the league's 30 teams. He will remain subject to the rookie salary cap, about $1 million next season. However, rookies can also negotiate performance bonuses, and the leverage of unrestricted free agency could increase the potential size of such bonuses.</p>
        <p>The decision could have long-term implications for the N.H.L. and its relationship to college hockey. Some of the aftershocks could become evident on Saturday, when highly regarded college players are expected to be chosen in the first round.</p>
        <p>''The potential ramifications are unknown and, right now, quite frankly, scary,'' said Lou Lamoriello, president and general manager of the Devils. ''This is not good for college hockey.''</p>
        <p>There is also a bonus for the Devils. Because they lost Van Ryn, they have been awarded a compensatory draft choice in Saturday's second round. In addition to one pick in the first round and two picks in the third round, the Devils now have four picks in the second round. In total, they have 7 of the first 76 selections.</p>
        <p>Among the top choices are several college players, some of them 19 years old, as Van Ryn was when the Devils drafted him. This could be tricky for both the players and the teams. William Daly, the chief legal officer of the league, said today that teams might downgrade the value of top collegians because of the risk involved in choosing them.</p>
        <p>One example might be Dany Heatley of Wisconsin, a forward rated first over all by the league's Central Scouting service. Theoretically, Heatley could follow Van Ryn's example by playing one more year of college, switching to a junior team and then declaring himself an unrestricted free agent in 2002 at age 21. When asked about his options in the wake of the Van Ryn decision, Heatley said:</p>
        <p>''I think it's great for college players. It opens some doors.''</p>
        <p>When asked if he would consider moving from college to junior hockey, Heatley replied, ''I'm open to anything right now.''</p>
        <p>But Ron Hainsey of Massachusetts-Lowell, also a potential first-round choice, expressed some misgivings. He said he could understand why N.H.L. teams might shy away from drafting college players high in the first round.</p>
        <p>''We'll see tomorrow if a lot of us start slipping later into the draft,'' Hainsey said. 'You can't blame teams for worrying about it because you're giving away a high pick. It's like giving away an important player you could have. Everybody's talking about it.''</p>
        <p>Lamoriello said players ''can manipulate'' their college and junior status ''to beat the rule'' and added, ''That's why this is such a bad thing.'' In addition, the National Collegiate Athletic Association is also considering significant changes for eligibility that would allow players to move from major junior hockey to college hockey at an early age. Currently, a major junior player cannot make this shift.</p>
        <p>The current rules between the league and the players association were bargained during a 15-week lockout that delayed the 1994-95 season. The rookie salary cap was one of the major victories for the owners. The agreement has been extended until the summer of 2004.</p>
