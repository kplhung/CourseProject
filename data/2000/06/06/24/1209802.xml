        <p>Near the ancient caves of Bet Guvrin in Israel, army officials say, there is a secret Palestinian village on a hill. It consists of about 15 houses and a mosque. It is for Israelis only.</p>
        <p>The village is a simulation, a three-dimensional stage set that the Israeli Army uses to train its troops in occupation techniques, riot control and all-out battle.

        <p>Near the ancient caves of Bet Guvrin in Israel, army officials say, there is a secret Palestinian village on a hill. It consists of about 15 houses and a mosque. It is for Israelis only.</p>
        <p>The village is a simulation, a three-dimensional stage set that the Israeli Army uses to train its troops in occupation techniques, riot control and all-out battle. It is populated by soldiers playing the roles of what an army official called ''the enemy'': Palestinian stone throwers and police officers, even journalists and homemakers. In the year-old mock village, the army experiments with techniques for controlling and reacting to violence in a way that is meant to minimize the risk to Palestinian civilians.</p>
        <p>For the Israeli soldiers trained there, the experience can be dizzying. On the one hand, they are engaged in active relationship with Palestinian troops in the West Bank, riding together on patrols and sitting together in offices, sharing data, coordinating arrests, jointly calming tensions. On the other, they are readying themselves for a defensive battle against them and their people.</p>
        <p>''It is exactly the double mission we deal with,'' a senior army official said. ''On one channel, we really know the Palestinian officers on a personal level. On the other, we prepare for events like those that took place in May.'' That was when Israeli and Palestinian soldiers engaged in extended gunfire exchanges in the West Bank.</p>
        <p>''We wear two heads,'' he added, ''and educate the soldiers to think two ways at once.''</p>
        <p>In a way that has alarmed Palestinian leaders, the Israeli Army has been putting out the word that it is gearing up for riots and more as the negotiations advance and a September deadline for a final agreement approaches. While the Israeli government is talking peace with the Palestinians, the Israeli Army is busy preparing for violent conflict.</p>
        <p>Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, the Israeli Army chief, warned last week that his forces would use helicopters and tanks to quash riots, if need be. ''Anyone who hurts Israeli soldiers will be hurt,'' he said. ''And if we need tanks, tanks will come. And if need combat helicopters, combat helicopters will come.''</p>
        <p>This week, the army said it would start equipping West Bank settlements with riot control gear, including tear gas and rubber bullets. This horrified the Palestinians, although the settlements are already armed with government-provided weapons and live ammunition, and the army has trained an emergency squad of reserve officers and soldiers who live in each settlement. All settlers trained and armed are cleared by the security services.</p>
        <p>The reigning assessment of Israeli military experts is that the Palestinians want their future state to be born through struggle. They do not want ''their state to be handed to them on a silver platter,'' a senior army official said. ''They want not an independence war, but maybe an independence struggle.''</p>
        <p>Palestinian officials are labeling this kind of talk a ''bad faith'' approach to the peace effort, which sours the mood on the ground in the West Bank and adversely affects the negotiations themselves. Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, speaking on Thursday in Ramallah, said he had immediately alerted the international authorities that the Israelis' bellicose talk was irresponsible.</p>
        <p>''We informed the United Nations, the European Union, the American administration, Russia, the nonaligned countries, China and Japan,'' he said. ''We explained to them that this is wrong, not only for the Palestinian track. It endangers peace in the Middle East.''</p>
        <p>In a letter to Kofi Annan, the United Nations secretary general, a Palestinian representative warned that the Israeli Army could set off violence with its threatening statements. ''Such threats of extreme force cannot be taken lightly as the fragile and tense situation in the area could quickly destabilize and words could be quickly translated into action,'' wrote Somaia Barghouti, a member of the Palestinians' observer mission at the United Nations.</p>
        <p>The Israeli Army says that it does not want to raise tensions, but that it does want to be prepared. Military officials point to the riots in May, which left 6 Palestinians dead as well as almost 1,000 Palestinians and 60 Israelis wounded.</p>
        <p>Israeli and Palestinian experts alike agree that those riots demonstrated that Mr. Arafat will permit or even encourage violent eruptions in the West Bank and Gaza. Israelis say he has used and is expected again to use violence to put pressure on Israel during the mood swings of the negotiations. And they note that, as May demonstrated, street riots can get out of hand and end in full-fledged gun battles.</p>
        <p>Palestinian opposition leaders have pointed to the Israeli troop withdrawal from Lebanon in May as evidence that armed struggle might accomplish more than talk. Palestinian officials still firmly advocate negotiation as the road to achievement, but they warn Israelis not to test their reaction to military threats.</p>
        <p>Jabril Rajoub, the security chief in the West Bank, said General Mofaz's words were ''a declaration of war.''</p>
        <p>''If he thinks his tanks and helicopters will be met by the white flag of surrender, he is mistaken,'' he said.</p>
        <p>After initially inviting a reporter to visit the mock Palestinian village in Bet Guvrin, Israeli Army officials later decided that the moment was ''too sensitive.''</p>
        <p>Many professional armies and police forces train in simulated settings. But the idea of Israel re-creating a Palestinian village to be used for military drills is a potentially explosive one against the backdrop of this week's back and forth between Israeli and Palestinian officials.</p>
        <p>Although the village opened about a year ago, its existence is not widely known. ''You can simulate one to one what happens in the territories,'' an army official said, ''how to use force, and if need be, helicopters; techniques for dealing with riots, arrests.''</p>
        <p>''It is standard for us to provide training for warfare in a developed area,'' he said. ''But we've never had such a realistic setting before.''</p>
        <p>The village is just one part of the army's regrouping after the deadly skirmishes between Israelis and Palestinians following Israel's opening of an entrance to the Western Wall tunnel in September 1996. During the tunnel riots, the stone-throwing and rubber bullet-shooting that typified the Palestinian-Israeli confrontations during the uprising of 1988-93 gave way to exchanges of live ammunition.</p>
        <p>The army established a project called ''low intensity conflict.'' It is based on preparations to respond to more sophisticated violence, involving not only automatic weapons but also what Israeli intelligence analysts say may be a cache of hand-held antiaircraft and antitank missiles.</p>
        <p>Most Israeli officers in the West Bank are now elite former paratroopers. The jeeps and other vehicles are now armored. Tanks have been positioned through the zones of conflict. Soldiers are trained in how to be snipers and to protect themselves from snipers.</p>
        <p>And the Israeli Army keeps a live map of points of friction in the West Bank that could ignite a conflagration, including the village of Sulfit adjacent to the settlement of Ariel. The goal, Israeli officials stress, is to anticipate and avert conflict. But, they added, they have to be prepared for worst-case scenarios, even as peace talks are supposedly aiming to end the conflict entirely.</p>
        <p>''We don't think the Palestinians can conquer a settlement,'' an army official said, ''but they can come to the fence and shoot. That's why we have trained and equipped the settlers. We don't want them to take on their own security unless there's an emergency. But there might be an emergency.''</p>
