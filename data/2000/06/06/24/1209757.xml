        <p>Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc., a biotechnology company, will receive up to $450 million in financing from Aventis Pharma, the European drug company, as part of a wide-ranging drug development and technology alliance announced yesterday.</p>
        <p>The deal is one of the largest ever between a pharmaceutical company and a biotechnology start-up, both in monetary value and the level of cooperation between the companies.</p>
        <p>Aventis will buy $250 million in Millennium stock over the next year. Based on Millennium's current market value, that would give Aventis a stake of about 2 percent. Aventis will also pay up to $200 million over five years to obtain technology for drug development.</p>
        <p>The two companies will jointly develop drugs for inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, asthma and multiple sclerosis. And they will work together to develop technology to speed development of drugs in general.</p>
        <p>''This alliance with Aventis is truly an over-the-top alliance,'' Mark Levin, chief executive of Millennium, said in a conference call with reporters yesterday.</p>
        <p>Thomas Hofstaetter, executive vice president of Aventis, said the agreement could help Aventis fill gaps in its technical capabilities in gene-hunting and analysis.</p>
        <p>Millennium, based in Cambridge, Mass., specializes in using genomics to develop drugs.</p>
        <p>Millennium executives said the deal should help their company in its quest to become a fully integrated pharmaceutical company.</p>
        <p>For the North American market, Millennium and Aventis will equally share the cost of developing the drugs for inflammatory diseases and the profits from selling them, with Millennium able to participate in sales and marketing. This is different from most such agreements, in which the pharmaceutical company handles sales and pays the biotechnology company a royalty.</p>
        <p>''The commercialization terms are very good for Millennium,'' said Michael G. King Jr., an analyst at Robertson Stephens in New York. Outside North America, Aventis will handle drug development and marketing and pay a royalty to Millennium.</p>
        <p>Executives of both companies said the inflammatory drug program will be one of the largest in the world. But neither company will contribute any drugs already in clinical trials. So it is likely to be at least two to three years before a drug developed by the alliance enters clinical trials, and perhaps an additional five years before one reaches the market, the executives said.</p>
        <p>Millennium is known for its large deals with drug companies. Two years ago, it announced a $465 million alliance with Bayer of Germany. Millennium said all its partnerships combined will provide it with $1.8 billion in revenue.</p>
        <p>Millennium shares sank 4 percent today, down $4.9375 to $119.5625 because of concern over the price Aventis will pay for its shares.</p>
        <p>Aventis will pay a little less than $120 a share for the first $150 million of Millennium stock, which it will buy soon. That price represents a 20 percent premium to the average price of Millennium over the last 30 days but is less than Millennium's price in recent days because its stock, along with that of other genomics companies, has been rising in anticipation of Monday's expected announcement of the completion of the draft of the human genome.</p>
        <p>Aventis will buy $50 million more of Millennium stock next January and another $50 million in July 2001.</p>
        <p>Aventis Pharma, based in Frankfurt, Germany, is the pharmaceutical subsidiary of Aventis S.A., which is based in Strasbourg, France, and was formed last year by the merger of Hoechst of Germany and Rhone-Poulenc of France. Shares of Aventis S.A. rose $1.3125, to $68.625, on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday.</p>
