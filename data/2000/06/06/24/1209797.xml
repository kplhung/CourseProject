        <p>Within hours of ordering his lawyers to release the transcript of his interview  into his 1996 fund-raising activities, Vice President Al Gore was back to business as usual today -- trolling for money.</p>
        <p>In an affluent Silicon Valley neighborhood, Mr. Gore raised $500,000 over lunch. In Denver on Thursday, Mr. Gore headlined two events that raised a total of $1.1 million. Today, after the Silicon Valley lunch, he attended a dinner on the San Francisco waterfront where the singers David Crosby and Steven Stills serenaded several hundred people.</p>
        <p>Then came a reception at a private home. The day's total take: $2 million. On Saturday, he was scheduled to attend a fund-raiser in Miami that was expected to bring his three-day total to more than $3.5 million.</p>
        <p>The fund-raising events were broken up by the news on Thursday that, based on an April 18 deposition of Mr. Gore, a Justice Department official was asking Attorney General Janet Reno for an investigation into the vice president's money-raising activities in 1996. On Thursday night, Gore advisers read the transcripts of the deposition and on Friday, released copies to news organizations.</p>
        <p>Concerns about Mr. Gore's overzealous money-raising, coming in the midst of a fund-raising swing, put an especially fine point on what Mr. Gore likes to call the ''irony'' of his situation.</p>
        <p>Here is how Mr. Gore, who has tried to deflect criticism of his links to the fund-raising problems by calling himself ''an imperfect messenger'' for overhauling the campaign finance system, dealt with this uncomfortable topic at lunch today:</p>
        <p>In a sun-splashed dining room, where paintings by Miro and Chagall decorated the stucco walls, he talked confidently about the nation's powerhouse economy, borrowing a line from Ronald Reagan: Did Americans feel they were better off today than they were eight years ago?</p>
        <p>There was a soft murmur of assent. And then, perhaps in a nod to the issue that had dominated today's news reports, Mr. Gore briefly made a pitch for tossing out the entire campaign finance system that has caused him so much grief.</p>
        <p>''It's an irony to talk about this issue at a fund-raising event, I realize,'' Mr. Gore told the dozen or so people who had paid $25,000 each to lunch on grilled salmon and vegetables. ''But the first bill I will present to Congress will be the McCain-Feingold campaign finance bill.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has struggled to focus attention on the upside of the Clinton administration: the economic expansion and his ideas for using the nation's growing budget surplus to improve education, health care and the environment. This forms the basis of his ''prosperity and progress tour'' and the underpinning of his candidacy.</p>
        <p>But he is being pulled away from sketching out a rosy future to explaining the past. And in doing so, he is being pulled inexorably into the downside of the administration -- not just the questionable fund-raising of 1996 but the specter of the next president spending his time being questioned under oath about whether he has told the truth.</p>
        <p>In the transcript released today, Mr. Gore gives a startling similar answer to the now-infamous answer given by President Clinton as he quibbled over the meaning of the word ''is.'' When Mr. Gore was asked what role the coffees would play in raising money, he said: ''Let me define the term 'raising,' '' adding, ''If you mean by it, would they be events at which money was raised, the answer is no.''</p>
        <p>For the last year, Mr. Gore has been working furiously to separate himself from an administration that has been accused repeatedly of not telling the truth even as his opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, has offered himself as an alternative.  And Mr. Bush clearly hoped that the call for an investigation into Mr. Gore's truthfulness would signal to voters that a Gore administration would not be that much different from Bill Clinton's. ''If America is tired of scandals and investigations, let's elect somebody different, other than the people of the Clinton/Gore administration,'' Mr. Bush said in Alabama today.</p>
        <p>At the time, the Gore campaign was employing a durable Clinton tactic made familiar during the Monica S. Lewinsky investigation -- pre-emptively releasing hundreds of pages of documents in an effort to defuse the controversy and dispatch it quickly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore and his advisers moved in an uncharacteristically aggressive fashion to dispel any suggestion of wrongdoing and, employing another Clinton tactic, suggested that the re-emergence of the issue was, if not a vast right-wing conspiracy, at least an orchestrated smear by the Bush campaign.</p>
        <p>The vice president hinted broadly that Thursday's disclosure of the request for an investigation was politically motivated.</p>
        <p>''I think the timing of this whole thing speaks for itself,'' Mr. Gore told reporters.</p>
        <p>''I have told the truth,'' he added. ''I have cooperated fully. And I don't want people to have the impression that I am trying to hide something. I am not. I want you to see it all.''</p>
        <p>Mark Fabiani, a spokesman for Mr. Gore and a veteran of the Clinton White House damage-control operation, said the release of documents was the best way for the Gore campaign to fight what he described as ''Republican dirty tricks.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fabiani said the Republicans, through Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, had leaked the information because ''Bush was having a bad day.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fabiani noted that the governor had been presiding over an execution and pointed to reports that Mr. Bush's financial ties to the oil industry would render him useless in the battle against high gasoline prices.</p>
        <p>''What the Republicans tried to do yesterday was to kick up dust and say, 'No one really knows what the issue is, but it's an issue, it's significant and it comes out of this April 18 deposition,' '' Mr. Fabiani said.</p>
        <p>Rachel Gorlin, a Democratic consultant, said the Gore campaign was probably smart to release the transcripts.</p>
        <p>''The Clinton lesson is to show that it's worth it to engage in the discussion, partly because the public doesn't care that much and partly because this gives Gore standing'' to make his case and challenge the Republicans, Ms. Gorlin said. ''The thinking is, let's take the hit now and move on, that they won't find anything they can use in the fall and by then it will be old news anyway.''</p>
        <p>She also said the possible investigation illustrated the age-old problem for vice presidents seeking to become president: ''Is this election about what's gone on during the previous administration or is it about what he can do in the future?''</p>
        <p>Allies of Mr. Gore saw another possible advantage in releasing the transcripts. Although Mr. Gore uses the word ''hell,'' apparently reinforcing reports that he was angry and confrontational during the deposition, Mr. Fabiani suggested that this showed passion, a quality that he has been accused of lacking.</p>
        <p>Spokesmen for the Bush campaign and for Mr. Specter said there was no collusion between them.</p>
