        <p>Jay Weiser Op-Ed article deplores Landmarks Preservation Commission for rejecting plans for a 17-story apartment tower at 91st Street and Madison Avenue; says obliging the tower's opponents, like Woody Allen, means cutting the number of new housing units in New York and jacking up the price of existing houses (M)</p>

        <p>Woody Allen has won and New Yorkers have lost. The filmmaker led a celebrity-studded opposition to a 17-story apartment tower at 91st Street and Madison Avenue in Manhattan, even creating a video to depict its alleged horrors. Last week the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission obliged him by rejecting plans for the tower.</p>
        <p>This is another triumph of the not-in-my-backyard attitude abbreviated as Nimbyism -- literally so in Mr. Allen's case, since he owns a brownstone right behind the proposed development site. But Nimbyism has a cost: in New York, it cuts the number of new housing units built and jacks up the price of existing housing.</p>

        <p>Woody Allen has won and New Yorkers have lost. The filmmaker led a celebrity-studded opposition to a 17-story apartment tower at 91st Street and Madison Avenue in Manhattan, even creating a video to depict its alleged horrors. Last week the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission obliged him by rejecting plans for the tower.</p>
        <p>This is another triumph of the not-in-my-backyard attitude abbreviated as Nimbyism -- literally so in Mr. Allen's case, since he owns a brownstone right behind the proposed development site. But Nimbyism has a cost: in New York, it cuts the number of new housing units built and jacks up the price of existing housing.</p>
        <p>The commission said that the proposed tower would not fit in with the context of the neighborhood, yet that stretch of Madison is architecturally mediocre. The existing Citibank branch building over which the tower was to be built is already awful-looking, and there are other comparably sized buildings in that area.</p>
        <p>But New York's land-use system is set up to frustrate development. The Landmarks Preservation Commission has designated huge swaths of the city as landmark districts -- including the Carnegie Hill Historic District, where the proposed tower was to be constructed -- and in them it controls what gets built. It seems that the commission's goal is to freeze the city into a 19th century theme park.</p>
        <p>And what the landmarks commission doesn't stop, zoning will: New York's zoning law, the most complex in the country, is so restrictive that housing developers must often get waivers, known as zoning variances, from city government. Moreover, in many cases when a waiver is needed a project must be put through  lengthy environmental reviews or endure the city's infamous Uniform Land Use Review Process, requirements that can eat up years. People who don't want anything new in their neighborhoods know that by objecting at every step of the way, they can use the regulatory process to slow or stop new building.</p>
        <p>The rest of us -- those who aren't multimillionaires living in lavish East Side townhouses like Woody Allen -- pay the price. New York City is facing a housing shortage. The city's housing vacancy rate is 3.19 percent, and housing prices are among the nation's highest. The city gained about 120,000 households from 1980 to 1996, but added only 53,516 units to its housing stock.</p>
        <p>Every unit that doesn't get built because of regulatory snarls contributes to this squeeze. And every unit that is delayed raises prices: developers have to pay interest on loans while land sits undeveloped, and have to pay enormous legal, architectural and consulting fees. All of that is passed on to the renter or buyer.</p>
        <p>When developers offer projects that create housing, they are denounced rather than praised for adding to the housing supply and helping to lower housing costs. Where are the protesters with placards and video cameras fighting for new apartments for New Yorkers?</p>
