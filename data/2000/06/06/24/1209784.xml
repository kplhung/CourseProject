        <p>The shareholders of both America Online and Time Warner voted yesterday to approve the merger of the companies into the world's largest media conglomerate.</p>
        <p>The companies do not expect to complete the deal until late fall because it must still gain the approval of a number of regulatory bodies, including the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, the European Union and the authorities in many cities where Time Warner owns cable television systems.</p>
        <p>Both regulators and analysts say they see little chance that the deal will be rejected, but officials are in no hurry to approve what would be the largest merger in corporate history, valued at $165 billion. Indeed, the F.C.C. is expected to hold a hearing in late July.</p>
        <p>''There is simply a process of checking off a series of boxes between now and the fall,'' said Henry Blodget, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. ''The shareholder vote was the biggest hurdle.''</p>
        <p>The biggest regulatory issue relates to whether the combined company will allow more than one high-speed Internet service to use its cable television systems. Until the merger, Time Warner had planned to offer only its Road Runner service. But the companies now pledge to allow competing services, like the Excite@Home service. The regulators may nonetheless impose some sort of requirement for open Internet access.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, Time Warner is negotiating with providers of high-speed Internet access to offer their services on its cable systems. It hopes to have a few such deals completed in the next month or two to show the regulators that it is acting in good faith.</p>
        <p>In a letter last week, the F.C.C. asked AOL and Time Warner about America Online's instant messaging  service and that company's stake in Hughes Communications, the provider of the DirecTV satellite service, which competes with Time Warner cable systems. In another letter released yesterday, the agency asked for documents related to business alliances by both companies, including Time Warner's stake in Road Runner and AOL's investment in the TiVo television recording system. Regulators and analysts said, though, that none of those issues was likely to be much of a sticking point for the deal.</p>
        <p>The European Union has said it will take four months to look at the deal, but it is expected to defer to regulators in the United States. The Europeans may, however, take a tougher look at Warner's unrelated proposal to combine its music operation with that of the EMI Group.</p>
        <p>In the shareholder votes, about 99 percent of Time Warner holders, meeting in Manhattan, and 97 percent of AOL holders, in Tysons Corner, Va., approved the deal.</p>
        <p>America Online, whose stock had soared in the weeks before the merger plan was announced on Jan. 10, agreed to exchange 1.5 of its shares for each share of Time Warner. For Time Warner holders, that would mean receiving stock in America Online worth $110.63, which is 71 percent more than its trading price the day before the deal was announced.</p>
        <p>Since then, with Internet stocks of all sorts collapsing, America Online shares have fallen 27 percent below their price before the deal, while Time Warner shares are still above their price before the merger agreement, although the premium has fallen to 20 percent. Yesterday, Time Warner shares fell $4.0625, to $77.5625, and America Online shares dropped $2.875, to $53.375, amid a general selloff of Internet shares.</p>
        <p>Stephen M. Case, chairman of America Online, was asked about the decline of the company's stock in a hotel ballroom packed with more than 500 shareholders.</p>
        <p>''What's happening really has less to do with AOL and less to do with the merger and more to do with what's happening in the sector,'' he said. ''Almost every company that we compete with, ranging from Yahoo to Amazon to Microsoft to AT&amp;T, are down substantially more than we are in that period.''</p>
        <p>As the deal works its way through Washington and Brussels, managers of both AOL and Time Warner are preparing organizational and operating plans so they can move quickly as soon as the deal is completed. The companies have promised Wall Street that they will cut $1 billion a year in costs and increase revenue by 30 percent a year, an aggressive target for many of Time Warner's more mature businesses.</p>
        <p>Top executives from Time Warner, including its chairman, Gerald M. Levin, and vice chairman, Ted Turner, regularly attend the weekly management meeting held by Mr. Case. And the company has planned a three-day management retreat in July timed to coincide with the baseball All-Star Game in Atlanta.</p>
        <p>The business issues discussed most heavily revolve around increasing advertising sales at the combined company and finding ways to sell subscriptions to Time Warner magazines, like Time and Fortune, to America Online users and ways to sell the AOL service to Time Warner magazine subscribers. There is continuing discussion, as at all record labels, about how to make sense of the rise of free music on the Internet using technologies like MP3 and Napster.</p>
