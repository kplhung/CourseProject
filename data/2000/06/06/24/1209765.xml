        <p>Pseudo Programs Inc., which bills itself as an online TV network, laid off about a quarter of its staff yesterday, continuing a trend in the Internet industry that began with April's stock market gyrations.</p>
        <p>Executives at the company's New York offices told 58 of its 240 employees that their services would no longer be needed. Most of the layoffs were from the production side of the operation.</p>
        <p>Executives of Pseudo, which recently raised another $14 million from investors, took pains to distinguish their turmoil from that of other Internet companies like APB.com, the crime news site that nearly collapsed recently, and DEN.com, the entertainment site that did.</p>
        <p>While acknowledging that financial pressure in the Internet sector has forced the company to make tighter budgets on the assumption that outside capital could soon dry up, David Bohrman, Pseudo's chief executive, said the company was in overall financial health and that it was due for a reorganization anyway.</p>
        <p>He said he planned to create 20 new positions in the near future, so that the net reduction in staff would be 16 percent.</p>
