        <p>Deep Discounts Fail to Lift Sales of Affordable Vehicles  Automakers say that despite recent deep discounts, auto sales have not picked up in June from the relatively subdued pace of May, providing evidence to the Federal Reserve that recent interest-rate increases may be slowing the American economy.</p>
        <p>Auto executives and dealers say sales of luxury cars and sport utility vehicles remain extremely strong. But the mass market for more affordable cars, minivans, sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks has softened as middle-class families have become leery of borrowing money at ever steeper rates.

        <p>Auto executives and dealers say sales of luxury cars and sport utility vehicles remain extremely strong. But the mass market for more affordable cars, minivans, sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks has softened as middle-class families have become leery of borrowing money at ever steeper rates.

        <p>AOL and Time Warner Clear a Hurdle  Shareholders of America Online and Time Warner voted to approve the merger of the two companies. But the concerns do not expect to complete the $165 billion deal until late fall because it must still gain the approval of a number of regulatory bodies, including the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, the European Union and the authorities in many cities where Time Warner owns cable television systems. The F.C.C. is expected to hold a hearing in late July. [C4.]</p>
        <p>S.&amp; P. Off Slightly in Mixed Trading  The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index was down 10.70 points, to 1,441.48, in mixed trading. Blue-chip shares rose and technology stocks came under selling pressure for the second consecutive day as investors locked in profits after a weeks-long run-up. The Dow Jones industrial average finished up 28.63 points, to 10,404.75, while the Nasdaq composite index fell 91.50 points, or 2.3 percent, to 3,845.34. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose to 6.03 percent from 5.96 percent on Thursday. [C3.]</p>
        <p>DoCoMo May Establish British Link  Responding to press reports that NTT DoCoMo was on the verge of acquiring a 15 percent stake in Telesystem International Wireless, a Canadian company that is heavily invested in the British market, a senior DoCoMo executive acknowledged that a link with Telesystem was an attractive option. Officially, DoCoMo declined to confirm the reports, but dropped hints that it might soon establish a presence in Britain. [C2.]</p>
        <p>ConAgra to Buy International Home  ConAgra said it had agreed to buy International Home Foods for about $1.6 billion in cash and stock in a deal that would put Chef Boyardee pasta, Gulden's mustard and PAM cooking spray into ConAgra's corporate pantry. Shareholders of International Home will receive $22 a share, half in cash and half in ConAgra stock. ConAgra, with brands like Orville Redenbacher popcorn, Swiss Miss hot chocolate and Healthy Choice prepared meals, will also assume $1.3 billion in debt. [C3.]</p>
        <p>Aventis in Alliance With a Start-Up  Millennium Pharmaceuticals will receive up to $450 million in financing from Aventis Pharma, the big European drug company, as part of a wide-ranging drug development and technology alliance. [C2.]</p>
        <p>China Toughens Talk on W.T.O. Entry  A top Chinese trade negotiator warned that his country would not make any more concessions to open up markets for goods and services in its bid to join the World Trade Organization. The negotiator, Long Yongtu, said some countries had raised ''unreasonable requests,'' apparently referring to an insistence by developing countries that they receive the same trade privileges that China had negotiated with the European Union and the United States.
