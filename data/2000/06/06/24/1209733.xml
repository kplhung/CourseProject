        <p>Automakers say that despite recent deep discounts, auto sales have not picked up in June from the relatively subdued pace of May, providing evidence to the Federal Reserve that recent interest-rate increases may be slowing the American economy.</p>
        <p>Auto executives and dealers say sales of luxury cars and luxury sport utility vehicles remain extremely strong.</p>
        <p>But the mass market for more affordable cars, minivans, sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks has clearly softened as middle-class families have become leery of borrowing money at ever steeper rates, they said.</p>
        <p>''Our Cadillacs are outselling our Pontiacs, and that has never happened to us before,'' said Michael Coy, the general manager of a dealership in Vancouver, Wash. The Cadillac buyers are frequently paying cash with their stock market profits, while traditional Pontiac customers are beginning to buy late-model used cars instead, he added.</p>
        <p>Frank Ursomarso, a dealer in Wilmington, Del., said on Thursday that his seven dealerships had sold 159 vehicles in June, compared with 166 in the period last year, because less-prosperous buyers were shifting to used cars. ''In my Jaguar, BMW and Volvo businesses, the pace is still very, very good -- those consumers who are more educated and more affluent are still buying,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Automakers, especially DaimlerChrysler A.G., have been stepping up their rebates, with Dodge now offering discounts on every model except the Viper sports car. But the manufacturers have also been quietly raising the subsidized interest rates they offer on car loans. They have concluded that it has become too costly to continue offering loans at 1.9 percent and subsidizing the difference compared with market rates on auto loans, which are approaching 10 percent for a three-year loan.</p>
        <p>Kevin Woods, the retail finance manager at Ford's lending unit, Ford Credit, said the discounted rates offered by Ford Credit were likely to rise another full percentage point when Ford adjusts rates in early July, even if Fed officials leave short-term rates unchanged next week as expected.</p>
        <p>High gasoline prices appear to have had surprisingly little effect so far on the types of vehicles being sold, industry officials said. Even in the Midwest, where gasoline prices are highest, the biggest gas-guzzlers, mainly large sport utilities, are selling well because they are being purchased by households so affluent that they are not especially worried about the cost of fuel, they noted.</p>
        <p>The auto industry sold cars and light trucks at a torrid seasonally adjusted annual rate of 18 million vehicles in the six-month period that ended on April 30. That pace cooled to a rate of 17.1 million vehicles in May, and both Ford and General Motors are predicting virtually the same rate -- 17 million -- for June.</p>
        <p>The auto industry sold 17 million vehicles in all of last year, its best year ever, so the pace in the last two months does not represent a significant slowdown. But it still shows a contrast with the brisk pace last winter, as small and midsize cars, sport utility vehicles, minivans and pickup trucks are now beginning to clog some dealerships' lots.</p>
        <p>Most automakers will be announcing their June sales on July 3, but DaimlerChrysler plans to wait until July 5. It will be very hard to judge the overall strength of sales in June until DaimlerChrysler reports because the company has become very aggressive in offering rebates after its sales plunged 16.8 percent in May. DaimlerChrysler had temporarily renounced most discounts in May in an unsuccessful attempt to persuade the industry to wean itself of its dependence on discounts.</p>
