        <p>AT&amp;T submitted a new proposal yesterday that would give telephone users more flexibility in seeking to save money on some long-distance calls but that appeared to fall short of stemming the outcry from consumer groups and federal regulators over its plans to raise certain costs for tens of millions of customers.</p>
        <p>Caught between the demands of Wall Street to generate higher earnings and the expectations of customers who were promised savings because of lower access charges, AT&amp;T said it would eliminate the $3 monthly minimum charge for low-volume callers and offer a wider variety of options to reduce charges for people who make most calls on certain weekend days.</p>

        <p>AT&amp;T submitted a new proposal yesterday that would give telephone users more flexibility in seeking to save money on some long-distance calls but that appeared to fall short of stemming the outcry from consumer groups and federal regulators over its plans to raise certain costs for tens of millions of customers.</p>
        <p>Caught between the demands of Wall Street to generate higher earnings and the expectations of customers who were promised savings because of lower access charges, AT&amp;T said it would eliminate the $3 monthly minimum charge for low-volume callers and offer a wider variety of options to reduce charges for people who make most calls on certain weekend days.</p>
        <p>Still, rates for many long-distance calls would go up under the plan, with some customers potentially facing per-minute charges as much as 56 percent higher.</p>
        <p>While William E. Kennard, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, said he was encouraged by AT&amp;T's move, a fellow commissioner sharply criticized the plan.</p>
        <p>''With its latest tariff filing, AT&amp;T failed to deliver the consumer benefits it promised,'' Gloria Tristani, one of the five F.C.C. commissioners, said in a statement.</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T, which handles 60 percent of the nation's residential long-distance calls, said it would give its 28 million customers not on discount plans a choice of three options.</p>
        <p>Beginning with the July telephone bills, one plan would allow those customers to pay 16 cents a minute on all calls regardless of time or day. Another plan would charge 10 cents a minute on one weekend day chosen by the customer, but impose higher charges ranging from 18 cents to 29.5 cents a minute the rest of the week.</p>
        <p>Those who fail to select one of those plans would face rates that would be raised several cents above AT&amp;T's basic charges, which are currently 11.5 cents on weekends, 26 cents on weekdays and 16 cents Monday through Friday evenings.</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T said it consulted with the F.C.C. on the new rate plans.</p>
        <p>''I do believe we've bent over backward to listen to people on this,'' said James Cicconi, AT&amp;T's general counsel. ''This reflects extensive consultation with the F.C.C. and with our customers.''</p>
        <p>The company said the new rate structure would cut its expected profits for the year  by 1 or 2 cents a share. Shares of AT&amp;T fell $1.6875, to $34.3125, on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
        <p>The plan also generally failed to impress consumer advocates, who praised its increased flexibility but criticized it for not passing on enough savings to customers from a recent F.C.C. agreement reducing the fees long-distance companies pay to local phone companies.</p>
        <p>''While they've responded to public criticism AT&amp;T has not gone far enough,'' said Gene Kimmelman, the co-director of the Washington office of Consumers Union, an advocacy group. ''But at least this proposal is an improvement because it provides people with more choices than they previously had.''</p>
        <p>After the F.C.C. lowered the fees paid by long-distance carriers to local telephone companies, AT&amp;T and other companies were expected to pass on some of these savings to customers.</p>
        <p>Yet on the same day the agreement was announced, AT&amp;T filed documents with the commission that suggested that the company would increase most of the per-minute charges for customers who make few calls.</p>
        <p>In today's filing, which was intended to mitigate the criticism from the earlier proposal, AT&amp;T eliminated its minimum monthly charge of $3, a move that would benefit 15 million of the 28 million customers the company has under its basic plan. In addition, AT&amp;T eliminated a $1.51 carrier line charge.</p>
        <p>According to one of the plans put forward today, the company would allow customers to make calls on one weekend day, either Saturday or Sunday, for 10 cents a minute, a reduction from the 11.5 cents a minute that was available earlier. On the other weekend day, though, charges would rise to 18 cents from 11.5 cents.</p>
        <p>Today's proposal is cheaper when compared with the plan submitted earlier this month that was discarded. Under that proposal, customers were to be charged 29 cents a minute on all days except Sunday, during which long-distance calls would cost 7 cents a minute.</p>
        <p>But for customers who do not choose any of AT&amp;T's new plans, long-distance rates will go up, to 14.5 cents a minute from 11.5 cents on Saturday and Sunday, to 29.5 cents a minute from 26 cents during peak hours on weekdays, and to 22.5 cents a minute from 19 cents on weeknights.</p>
        <p>WorldCom and Sprint, the second-  and third-largest long-distance companies, have not raised rates in recent days. Analysts suggested that AT&amp;T would probably not benefit from today's proposal, putting additional pressure on the company's stock, which has declined nearly 40 percent in the last three months.</p>
        <p>''The guidance they're giving is that this should translate into a net reduction in revenue,'' said Scott Cleland, a telecommunications analyst at Legg Mason Precursor Group. ''This isn't good for AT&amp;T, given that they've been consistently losing share to competitors.''</p>
