        <p>COLOMBIA: KIDNAP VICTIMS FREED  The victims of a pair of politically emblematic kidnappings that deeply offended the Colombian public were both released. A right-wing paramilitary group freed Guillermo Valencia, left, a member of Congress who is the brother of one of the government's chief negotiators in peace talks with leftist guerrillas. He was seized Monday in an effort to torpedo the talks, while a 5-year-old girl whose parents said she was being held by the country's main left-wing guerrilla group was released after 70 days in captivity, but only after a ransom was paid.</p>

        <p>VENEZUELA: VOTE SET  The presidential election scheduled for May 28 but postponed when the National Electoral Council acknowledged that its vote-counting system was hopelessly flawed has been rescheduled for July 30. Governors, members of Congress and mayors are to be elected the same day, but voting for regional and local councils has been pushed back to Oct. 1.</p>

        <p>ARGENTINA: PRESIDENT OVERRULED  A labor court ruled to overturn a recent act of President Fernando de la Rua to cut public service salaries by 12 to 15 percent as an austerity move to reduce the deficit and cut interest rates. The ruling came after recent labor strikes but is expected to be overturned by higher courts.</p>

        <p>IRELAND: MAD COW FRAUD  An Irish farmer was sentenced to five years in prison after pleading guilty to importing a cow with mad cow disease into his herd in 1996. James Sutton, 49, faced debts of $833,000 and stood to gain $89,000 from a government compensation program when his herd was destroyed to prevent the spread of the disease. Later investigations revealed that a smuggling operation brought in infected cattle from Northern Ireland.</p>

        <p>KOSOVO: A U.N. PULLOUT  The United Nations refugee agency said it was suspending operations in the Serbian area of the divided town of Mitrovica after rioting injured aid workers. A spokeswoman, Paula Ghedini, said 5 United Nations vehicles had been destroyed in the rioting, and more than 20 damaged, while one aid worker was beaten and the homes of six aid workers attacked.</p>

        <p>KOSOVO: ALBANIAN TOLL  An estimated 12,000 Kosovar Albanians died in the conflict between February 1998 and June 1999, and most of the victims were civilians, American researchers say. The death rate was two to three times higher than normal and reached its peak in the months of the NATO airstrikes and the increased Serbian ethnic cleansing, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. It said its figures, published in The Lancet in London, are consistent with other estimates.</p>

        <p>GERMANY: KOHL ATTACKED  The governing Social Democrats urged former Chancellor Helmut Kohl to resign from Parliament a day after he made comments comparing their recent treatment of him over illegal campaign funds with Nazi persecution of the Jews. A leading Social Democrat, Wilhelm Schmidt, said Mr. Kohl had become an ''unacceptable liability for the entire German people.'' Mr. Kohl rejected the demand, saying he ''requires no history lessons'' from his political foes.</p>

        <p>NIGERIA: UNION UNREST  Public-sector pay talks have broken down, threatening a new round of unrest two weeks after a general strike over fuel prices, unions said. The Nigeria Labor Congress ordered workers to ''cripple any government that refuses to comply'' with monthly minimum demands of $75 a month in oil-producing states and $65 in states that do not produce oil.</p>

        <p>AFGHANISTAN: AID PLEA  The United Nations refugee agency called for more aid for Afghanistan, warning that drought conditions may force Afghans to flee to Pakistan and Iran. Afghanistan has been hit by its worst drought in 30 years, raising the specter of mass starvation, the agency said.</p>

        <p>SRI LANKA: TAMIL PLAN  President Chandrika Kumaratunga and the main opposition United National Party have agreed to form an interim council to administer Sri Lanka's northeast in an attempt to end Tamil separatist violence. Tamil Tiger rebels will not be a part of the council unless they renounce violence, officials said.</p>

        <p>SINGAPORE: CELL PHONE CURBS  Singapore, known for its strict anti-littering, anti-chewing-gum laws, now plans to jail motorists who hold mobile phones to their ears while driving. They face a six-month jail term for a first offense or a $588 fine, or both, as well as a driving ban, a police spokesman said. A second offense would double the fine and jail term.</p>
        <p>(Reuters)</p>
        <p>MIDDLE EAST</p>
        <p>IRAN: KHATAMI PLEA  President Mohammad Khatami, on the second day of a five-day visit to China, called for an ''Asian convergence'' aimed at standing up to Western dominance and globalization. Mr. Khatami called China and Iran two of the world's greatest civilizations, saying they needed to work together to forge the world of tomorrow, ''hampering the domination of the world's unipolar system.''</p>

        <p>IRAN: SPY VERDICT SEEN  The judge in the trial of 13 Iranian Jews accused of spying for Israel will issue a verdict in the case on July 1, a court official said. Eight of the 13 Jewish defendants have pleaded guilty, four have pleaded innocent and one has said he passed information to Israel but did not think his action constituted espionage. Israel has said none of the 13 were spies.</p>

        <p>UNITED NATIONS</p>
        <p>RUSSIAN WALKOUT  Russia's ambassador, Sergey Lavrov, walked out of the Security Council after members voted not to allow Yugoslavia's delegate to speak in a session on the European Union's peace efforts in the Balkans. Richard C. Holbrooke, the American delegate, said the vote was based on President Slobodan Milosevic's refusal to change Yugoslavia's nomenclature and flag, saying it was unacceptable that the ''flag of Tito'' still flies on First Avenue.</p>
