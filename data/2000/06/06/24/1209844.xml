        <p>VitriSeal Inc., which makes products that protect against metal corrosion, said yesterday that it would buy Distech Ltd. of New Zealand for about $54.7 million in stock. VitriSeal said it would issue 16.2 million common shares for the closely held Distech, which makes water-purification equipment for car washes. VitriSeal, based in Draper, Utah, said Distech's V-Still equipment recycles and purifies water for commercial uses. In January, VitriSeal agreed to buy the closely held Thermoflow Corporation, whose equipment recycles antifreeze, and the Liquitek Corporation, which uses Thermoflow's technology to clean waste water, for $86.4 million in stock.</p>
