        <p>A Web site about international security has published a list of names from a Central Intelligence Agency document that The New York Times had deleted when it originally posted the report on its own Web site. The document outlined the C.I.A.'s involvement in a 1953 coup in Iran.</p>
        <p>The Times decided to black out about two dozen names because editors thought that publishing them might endanger the lives of those people. Almost all were Iranians and had been involved in the coup.</p>

        <p>A Web site about international security has published a list of names from a Central Intelligence Agency document that The New York Times had deleted when it originally posted the report on its own Web site. The document outlined the C.I.A.'s involvement in a 1953 coup in Iran.</p>
        <p>The Times decided to black out about two dozen names because editors thought that publishing them might endanger the lives of those people. Almost all were Iranians and had been involved in the coup.</p>
        <p>The Web site administrator who published the names, John Young, was able to see them on The Times's Web site when a computer programming error allowed the names to briefly flash on the screen of a slow-running computer.</p>
        <p>After blacking out the names, The Times posted the full C.I.A. report on its site on June 11. The full-length report was published as supplemental information to an article that had run in the newspaper and on the Times Web site. The article drew on information in the full-length report to explain the C.I.A.'s involvement in the Iran coup.</p>
        <p>On Monday, when Mr. Young told editors of The New York Times on the Web that he could see the names, they asked him not to make them public. The Times fixed the computer problem that had allowed Mr. Young to see the names, but not before he was able to release his list later that day.</p>
        <p>''We regret that these names were published,'' said Bernard Gwertzman, editor of The New York Times on the Web. ''It seemed unnecessary to print these names.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gwertzman said the immediate impact of Mr. Young's publication of the names was not clear. Mr. Young could not immediately be reached by telephone for comment and did not respond to an e-mail message.</p>
        <p>The original C.I.A. document was obtained by The Times and explained in detail a joint operation by British and American intelligence agencies to overthrow Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh, an elected leader with a nationalist agenda. The agencies' plan was to install Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi, a pro-Western leader. The success of the coup had far-reaching consequences and helped set the stage for the Islamic revolution in 1979.</p>
