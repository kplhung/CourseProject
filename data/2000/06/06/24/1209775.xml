        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki signed into law today a two-tier bailout plan for troubled Nassau County that will create an independent board to oversee the county's finances and provide $105 million in state aid to help it pay its bills over the next five years.</p>
        <p>The independent board, the Nassau Interim Finance Authority, will  have the power to restructure $415 million in debt owed by the cash-strapped county.

        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki signed into law today a two-tier bailout plan for troubled Nassau County that will create an independent board to oversee the county's finances and provide $105 million in state aid to help it pay its bills over the next five years.</p>
        <p>The independent board, the Nassau Interim Finance Authority, will  have the power to restructure $415 million in debt owed by the cash-strapped county. And if the county fails to take in more than it spends, the board will seize control of its finances, leaving elected officials with no say in spending and taxation issues.</p>
        <p>The county, in return for the money from the state, must cut its budget by $52 million this year and $70 million in each of the next three years.</p>
        <p>''This critically important legislation will allow Nassau County to take a huge step forward on the road back to fiscal responsibility,'' Mr. Pataki said.</p>
        <p>While the county has already outlined the reductions it has to make this year, Judith A. Jacobs, the presiding officer of the County Legislature, cautioned the legislators about the future. ''We're going to have to take a hard look at next year,'' she said of a looming $200 million deficit. ''We're still looking to tighten, but I want to prepare people that we will eventually have to pay more in taxes.''</p>
        <p>Today, the County Legislature voted on the final measures it will send  to the new authority to meet the $52 million threshold.</p>
        <p>Among those items are increased gun permit fees, reimbursement from the federal and state governments for housing their inmates at the county jail, incentives for early retirement for 56 nonunion employees and increased fines for reporting a false fire alarm.</p>
        <p>Those measures are expected to save the county $1.8 million this fiscal year and $23 million in the next four years.</p>
        <p>Debate today among legislators and opponents over the gun permit fees was heated. . Gun owners, citing the Federalist Papers and Scripture, criticized the county's decision to increase the fee for a pistol permit to $200 from $40, and the fee for a renewal to $200 from $25.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Jacobs defended the decision, suggesting that the county was not in a position to drag its feet on budget cuts. ''Our word in Albany has to mean something,'' she said.  ''We've got to do some things we don't like.''</p>
        <p>Much of the $52 million in reductions this year involves the ''easy stuff,'' Ms. Jacobs said.</p>
        <p>Nearly $15 million is a one-time reimbursement to the county from the state for housing the state's inmates at the Nassau County Correctional Facility. An additional $8 million comes from higher-than-anticipated returns on investments. And $5.5 million comes from deferring payments to police officers who will receive the money when they retire from the force.</p>
        <p>As for this year, the county is not yet out of the woods. Standard &amp; Poor's, the credit-rating agency, has threatened to downgrade Nassau's bonds to junk status if it feels the county has not made sufficient progress on balancing its books. The agency is expected to make a statement on Tuesday.</p>
