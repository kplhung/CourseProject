        <p>Terry Brands was scaling a fence four years ago this June, desperate to escape his humiliation, manic to leave his defeat on the other side and be alone with his misery in the mountains outside of Spokane, Wash.</p>
        <p>Brands, a two-time world champion, was favored to make the 1996 Olympic team, but instead had lost to Kendall Cross in the finals of the Olympic freestyle wrestling trials. His twin brother, Tom, had followed him by making the Olympic team in a weight class above him.</p>
        <p>After their bouts, Tom found Terry on the fence outside the arena and frantically grabbed his brother's leg. Brands screamed ''Let me go!'' but Tom would not.</p>
        <p>Four years later Tom will not let go. Neither can Terry. Terry Brands is two matches away from redemption at these 2000 Olympic freestyle wrestling trials.</p>
        <p>In Atlanta he watched Tom capture an Olympic gold medal. He kept wrestling, but last October, at age 31, Terry Brands decided to retire when his physical pain surpassed his mental anguish.</p>
        <p>Last night Terry Brands roared out of retirement, a 32-year-old man with a wife and child. More possessed than he was four years ago, he earned a spot in the two-of-three finals Saturday. Six weeks ago he decided to petition to come here in the 58-kilogram weight class (127.75 pounds) and was seeded second. Brands will meet Kerry Boumans, the national champion.</p>
        <p>''I feel like I have a lot to prove to myself and the rest of the world,'' Brands said, gritting his teeth and glaring after winning his bout against his rival Eric Guerrero, 6-1. Entering the finals, that was the only point Brands had given up in three matches at Reunion Arena.</p>
        <p>''I put myself in some situations that were tough to come back to,'' Brands said. ''But you hold your head up high, and I feel like I'm back doing what I need to do.''</p>
        <p>After losing to Cross and then seeing him win gold in Atlanta, ''it made me a pretty bitter person to be around,'' Brands said. He tasted the bitter bile again when he came to Dallas and saw that Cross was featured in celebration on the credentials, programs and posters for these trials. ''I see him every day, and that's motivating to me,'' Brands said with disgust.</p>
        <p>He began to rethink his retirement following the national championships in April. He had a talk with his father, who had watched him and his brother wrestle since they were 12 in Sheldon, Iowa. ''He told me, 'You're going to get tough or hang up the shoes,' '' Brands said.</p>
        <p>The two-time National Collegiate Athletic Association champion at Iowa chose the former, a path, with the exception of his brief retirement, he has taken his entire life. ''He looks really good, he's not so mechanical, just very efficient,'' said Tom Brands, who is older by five minutes and retired after his gold. He has become Brands's coach here. ''I am very confident at this point. But he's not all the way back yet.''</p>
        <p>Brands's victory was the emotional centerpiece to a day for personal vindication. In the heavyweight freestyle challenge tournament finals, Stephen Neal defeated Tully Thompson, 8-2, advancing to Saturday's final against his archrival Kerry McCoy of Middle Island, N.Y.</p>
        <p>''It's very personal,'' said Neal, who lost to McCoy at the national championships. ''He's trying to prove I'm not the best person in America and I want to show that I am.''</p>
        <p>Matt Ghaffari, the Greco-Roman heavyweight and the 1996 Olympic silver medalist, is trying to prove the same point. He was losing by a point to Dremiel Byers in the heavyweight finals of the Greco-Roman challenge tournament today. To advance,  Ghaffari had to pull out a trick he first used two decades ago at Paramus High School in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>''I call it the fish move,'' Byers said. Ghaffari attacked Byers, bent his bad back and dropped him to the mat, using the move to seize a 3-1 comeback victory over the 25-year-old. ''You do it to a new fish and they'll fall for it every time.''</p>
        <p>At 38, and a loss away from retirement, Ghaffari is still crafty and accomplished, compiling more Olympic and world championship medals than any other Greco-Roman wrestler with four.</p>
        <p>''For this 38-year-old with a chance to go to his third consecutive Olympics, it is an honor,'' Ghaffari said. ''I want to make the Olympic team and bring wrestling some attention.''</p>
        <p>The majority of his opponents and other wrestlers, however, think the 1996 silver medalist is only interested in bringing attention to himself. They bristle when Ghaffari decorates his singlet with sponsor patches, shake their heads when he talks his way into first class or speaks of himself in the third person. They are tired of his act.</p>
        <p>''Everyone wants Ghaffari to lose; no question,'' Byers said.</p>
        <p>They cannot dispute his record, though. ''Truth be told, I lost to a good wrestler,'' Byers said. ''I've said a million times, he's the smartest heavyweight, there's no doubt about it. He has more experience than the rest of us.''</p>
        <p>And that is what has Rulon Gardner, the top-seeded wrestler, worried for Saturday. Ghaffari had to wrestle three matches leading up to the finals. Because Gardner, 28, defeated Ghaffari at the national championships he received a bye and sat in the arena the past two days. Gardner has won all 17 of his matches this season.</p>
