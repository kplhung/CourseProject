        <p>For about the 200th time this year, Dana Quigley played a round of golf today.</p>
        <p>''I do not ever get up in the morning not thinking of playing,'' he said before teeing off in his 96th consecutive Senior Tour event, the Cadillac N.F.L. Golf Classic.</p>
        <p>The 53-year-old Quigley does not look at himself as an iron man, but as merely the luckiest man on the face of the earth, as another iron man, Lou Gehrig, once remarked.</p>
        <p>Things have changed for the club pro at Crestwood Country Club in Rehoboth, Mass., whose penchant for late hours kept him from earning even $40,000 a year on the PGA Tour.</p>
        <p>Now in his fourth season as a senior, Quigley routinely earns a million dollars or more. He has already surpassed $900,000 this season, and although he has only one victory, he is second among money-earners.</p>
        <p>And he will, of course, play in all 39 Senior Tour events.</p>
        <p>He flies out Sunday night to the next stop, the Senior Open outside of Bethlehem, Pa.</p>
        <p>He was one of today's par-makers, six strokes behind Lee Trevino, who fired a 66.</p>
        <p>''I don't practice,'' said Quigley, who lives in West Palm Beach, Fla. ''I don't spend hours at the driving range or the putting tee. When I practice, I'm playing.''</p>
        <p>Oh, there is an exception to his everyday-play policy, he admitted. ''On Christmas, I see my kids in Rhode Island,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The rest of the year, he and his wife, Angie, who left her job as a physical therapist, follow the sun.</p>
        <p>''Now,'' he said, ''we don't have to work again the rest of our lives.''</p>
        <p>Quigley was like a kid today on opening day because he was playing with Arnold Palmer.</p>
        <p>''This is like a reward for everything I've ever done,'' he said. ''I've played with him before, but never on the opening round, never on a Friday. Whoever would have thought that one day I'd be in the first day's pairing with Arnold Palmer? But sometimes it's better when this happens to you later in life rather than sooner.''</p>
        <p>Both birdied the first hole, with Palmer ending the day at one over with a 73, but Quigley had his own style. He picks up his divots and hands them to his caddie, one of the few players on the tour who does that. He has an economical backswing, and putts cross-handed.</p>
        <p>Certainly, Quigley must stretch or exercise since he plays every day?</p>
        <p>''When I first came out, I did the physical fitness thing -- and the next day I had pain in muscles I didn't know I had,'' he said. ''I haven't done it since.''</p>
        <p>Playing is all he wants to do. He calls it ''a great challenge at every level.'' He spoke of playing with his brother and brother-in-law early next week, probably 27 to 36 holes a day.</p>
        <p>''Gotta go now,'' he said. ''I have to hit some balls and then go to Bible study.''</p>
        <p>CHIP SHOTS</p>
        <p>LEE TREVINO, using a new Ben Hogan driver, said he was playing his best golf in years. ''Every day I work on some things,'' he said. ''If I play well Saturday, I have an outside chance of winning.'' His score included a 32 on the front nine, and he hit all but two greens in regulation.</p>
        <p>PHILLIPPI SPARKS, who failed to make the cut among the National Football League players, reiterated his claim that he has retired from the Giants. He did laugh, though, when asked whether he would be persuaded to return to another team if it asked him after a grueling training camp.</p>
        <p>''I'm through; I own three companies,'' the former defensive back said. ''Some teams have told me they want me. But I'm not coming back.'' . . . CHRIS HETHERINGTON, the Carolina fullback, and CRAIG HENTRICH, the Tennessee punter, led the 12 N.F.L. qualifiers. Each shot a 74. The players have an 18-hole one-day event on Saturday to determine their winner.</p>
