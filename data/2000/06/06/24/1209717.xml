        <p>David DeWitt reviews five one-act plays celebrating gay pride in Program B of Unity Fest: Cherry Reds by Gary Garrison, Maggie Lally directing; Hiding the Pink by Mrinalini Kamath, Eddie Lew directing; Something Akin to a Restoration by Jim Fitzmorris, Dennis Smith directing; Red Wait by Amy A Kird, Donna Jean Fogel directing; and Too Much of Me by James Magruder, Dennis Smith directing (M)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Anyone tromping around Greenwich Village in June is likely to pass more than a few rainbow flags. Gay pride is in the air. And it's on the stage as well, in Fourth Unity's festival of one-act plays, inspired by Gay Pride Month and staged at the Bank Street Theater.</p>
        <p>''Something Akin to a Restoration'' is perhaps the most celebratory of the five plays in Unity Fest's Program B. Jim Fitzmorris's creative script imagines a San Francisco of the future, when the country is led by a female president. The city is a liberated mecca, then an oppressed military state, and finally a restored kingdom thanks to rebels like Davenant (Ivan Davila), who romps across the stage in a white tank top, encouraging solidarity with raised fists.</p>

        <p>Anyone tromping around Greenwich Village in June is likely to pass more than a few rainbow flags. Gay pride is in the air. And it's on the stage as well, in Fourth Unity's festival of one-act plays, inspired by Gay Pride Month and staged at the Bank Street Theater.</p>
        <p>''Something Akin to a Restoration'' is perhaps the most celebratory of the five plays in Unity Fest's Program B. Jim Fitzmorris's creative script imagines a San Francisco of the future, when the country is led by a female president. The city is a liberated mecca, then an oppressed military state, and finally a restored kingdom thanks to rebels like Davenant (Ivan Davila), who romps across the stage in a white tank top, encouraging solidarity with raised fists.</p>
        <p>Davenant's journey is personal as well, as he struggles with the more assimilationist instincts of his lover, William (Ian O'Donnell). Minority theater often grapples with the intersection of individual and communal identity, and ''Restoration'' works hard (perhaps too hard) to embrace both concerns.</p>
        <p>The evening's other plays -- thin in parts, but thoughtful in sum -- more firmly emphasize individual concerns and the questions that accompany them.</p>
        <p>Most intriguing is Amy A. Kirk's ''Red Wait,'' set in a gynecologist's office. Mona (Bilgin Turker) is chatting with a fellow patient (Leila Mansury) who is married and pregnant with her first child; a light flash later the same fellow patient is married and pregnant and has four children. Another light flash and she's pregnant but married to a woman. Yet another flash and she's not pregnant at all, just stuffing her tummy with a pillow because she likes the way it feels.</p>
        <p>The conversational loops in these flashes work to solidify Mona, a comfortable and proclaimed lesbian, while making her acquaintance a widely mutable persona. Just who is this woman, and what is Mona to make of her? Ms. Kirk serves these questions in artful dollops, aided by Donna Jean Fogel's smooth direction and the most natural and consistent cast of the evening.</p>
        <p>The program is full of fine roles for women. In James Magruder's ''Too Much of Me,'' Ann Chandler plays Georgette, a Southern belle who used to dance in pasties but now dances for Christ. Georgette is visiting her gay son, Vergil (a sharp Tony Hamilton) but finds herself alone with Dennis (C. Richard Cranwell Jr.), Vergil's relatively new lover and a father of four.</p>
        <p>As with ''Red Wait,'' ''Too Much of Me'' earns the audience's free laughter, mostly because of Ms. Chandler's appealing, freestyle Georgette. Amid insults, this woman has Dennis doff a shirt so she can try swatches of color on his skin tone; she suggests wax for his back hair; she regales him with the delights of her move to Florida (''Let us give praise to Jesus for water slides!'').</p>
        <p>Vergil has hidden his mother from Dennis -- understandably, based on what we see of Georgette's probable influence. But hiding the truth is the problem here, and ''Too Much of Me'' suggests that perhaps it's time for Vergil to come out of the closet and proclaim that he's a sometime Christian with a mother gunning for imminent salvation in the glory of a double-wide trailer.</p>
        <p>The flawed but charming Georgette has a strong sister in Lonnie D, the lone character of Gary Garrison's ''Cherry Reds.'' Lonnie D (the snappy Lorna Ventura) is ready to leave her man, and she's packing her many, many shoes, arranged in an enchanting arc around the stage: high heels, disco boots, work boots, sandals, sneakers, ruby slippers and especially the title footwear.</p>
        <p>Slipping on her ''cherry reds,'' Lonnie D leaves her packing behind and recalls her high school days -- in particular, questions of identity after she fielded a sexual advance from her same-gender best friend.</p>
        <p>The memory affirms Lonnie D because of its link not to sexual identification but to gender celebration. ''Women are fierce. We're, like, the fierce gender,'' she says, popping her lips with a smack.</p>
        <p>Mr. Garrison's material is witty and wise, but Maggie Lally's direction gives it a sloppy shape and a flat progression; the music, fun stuff from Sly and the Family Stone, Barry White and Patti LaBelle, competes with the script and intrudes on its clarity. Too bad.</p>
        <p>Inconsistent efforts are part of the deal in one-act festivals, and ''Hiding the Pink'' covers the weaker end of this spectrum. Still, Mrinalini Kamath's play explores a revolutionary question, at least for an assured gay man: What if he wants to experiment with heterosexuality to find out what it's like in the mainstream?</p>
        <p>''Hiding the Pink'' suggests he'd be the loneliest, most marginalized character in Unity Fest, a program that explores the strengths and limitations, part and parcel, of any simple definition of ''gay community.''</p>
