        <p>Three young men were fatally shot yesterday in unrelated homicides in New York, the police said.</p>
        <p>In the first killing, at 2:30 p.m., Carl Briggs, 24, was shot once in the head outside 558 Parkside Avenue in Kensington, Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Mr. Briggs was declared dead on arrival at Kings County Hospital Center, said Detective John Giammarino, a police spokesman.</p>
        <p>At 9:50 p.m., a 24-year-old man was fatally shot once in the chest outside 52 West 182nd Street in University Heights, the Bronx.</p>
        <p>The third killing was at 10:36 p.m., when a 28-year-old man was shot twice in the chest and once in the groin, Detective Giammarino said.</p>
        <p>The victim, who was found outside 2176 Fifth Avenue in Harlem, was pronounced dead on arrival at Harlem Hospital Center.</p>
        <p>In all three cases, the weapons have not been found and the assailants are thought to be men. The motives behind the killings are unknown.</p>
        <p>The police did not release the names of two of the three victims because their families had not been notified.</p>
