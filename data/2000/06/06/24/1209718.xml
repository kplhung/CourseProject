        <p>David Hidalgo, half of the blues-guitar duo Houndog, looked defeated. Finishing a tepid version of Big Bill Broonzy's ''It Was Just a Dream,'' he appealed to his Carnegie Hall audience on Thursday night: ''It's kind of hard . . . we're asked to represent giants, and we're just a couple of midgets.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hidalgo, whose regular gig is with Los Lobos, is one of the better players and singers in American popular music. But in this context, at the JVC Jazz Festival's ''From Spirituals to Swing'' concert, what he said was a welcome bit of reality in an evening that blew a lot of well-meaning smoke. He was standing in for Broonzy, early American acoustic blues and the larger specter of the famous 1938 and 1939 ''From Spirituals to Swing'' concerts, which took place in the same hall.</p>

        <p>David Hidalgo, half of the blues-guitar duo Houndog, looked defeated. Finishing a tepid version of Big Bill Broonzy's ''It Was Just a Dream,'' he appealed to his Carnegie Hall audience on Thursday night: ''It's kind of hard . . . we're asked to represent giants, and we're just a couple of midgets.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hidalgo, whose regular gig is with Los Lobos, is one of the better players and singers in American popular music. But in this context, at the JVC Jazz Festival's ''From Spirituals to Swing'' concert, what he said was a welcome bit of reality in an evening that blew a lot of well-meaning smoke. He was standing in for Broonzy, early American acoustic blues and the larger specter of the famous 1938 and 1939 ''From Spirituals to Swing'' concerts, which took place in the same hall.</p>
        <p>The two original concerts (there was a third in 1967) were innovations both in concert programming and in race relations. John Hammond, their producer, laid out what was the fashionable narrative of black American vernacular music. His program broke down the concert into ''African Tribal Music,'' ''Spirituals and Holy Roller Rhythms,'' ''Early New Orleans Jazz,'' boogie-woogie and swing, with performers representing each style. Everyone he selected -- he was adamant about presenting black and white performers onstage, the first time anyone had done so at Carnegie Hall -- was, then or later, important: Count Basie, Benny Goodman, Albert Ammons, Rosetta Tharpe and on and on.</p>
        <p>In staging his concerts, Hammond traded effectively on fear and fascination, and the ''serious'' audience's perception of Southern black musicians as cultural outsiders: the title of Hammond's program notes for the 1938 concert was ''The Music Nobody Knows.'' Things have changed a little since then. Belaboring the connections between gospel, blues and swing these days -- much less showing how musicians of different races can play together quite comfortably, thanks -- is bringing coals to the Newcastle of our minds. Aretha Franklin and Stanley Turrentine, for example, are playing a festival concert program tonight, and with no stated rubric or reason, those in the audience will hear blues, bebop, gospel and pop; they don't need a John Hammond any more to tell them how all this music fits together.</p>
        <p>So the program notes for Thursday night could have been called ''The Music Everybody Knows.'' But the show's producer, Danny Kapilian, did his best to preserve one aspect of Hammond's idea: he created a few new juxtapositions and introduced the members of the audience to some performers they probably hadn't known. (At least the master of ceremonies, Danny Glover, didn't know them; he mangled almost every name.)</p>
        <p>Opening the show, Angelique Kidjo sang songs from Benin, accompanied by a percussionist; Dr. John played a little boogie-woogie piano by himself, then was joined by Don Byron on clarinet and Steve Wilson on soprano saxophone for a rhythmically flustered blues. In the role of Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Joan Osborne worked hard and cut through with a clear, strong voice, backed by the guitarist Wendell Holmes. And the SRC All-City Chorale represented the Golden Gate Quartet, singing ''Gospel Train'' and ''I'm on My Way.''</p>
        <p>Don Byron brought a specially convened sextet on stage and proceeded to raise the bar considerably, tangling with Benny Goodman's contribution from the 1939 concert. (For those interested in hearing the original five-song set, it's part of a recent three-CD reissue on the Vanguard  label; the Goodman sextet's performance is exquisite.) It worked out nicely; the musicians seemed free of homage-anxiety as they played ''Flying Home,'' ''Memories of You'' and Mr. Byron's piece ''Tuskegee Strutters Ball,'' based on the changes of ''I Got Rhythm.'' James Hurt's emphatically rhythmic piano solo -- he connected well with the drummer Joey Baron -- broke the ice, prompting the first spontaneous applause of the evening. Things started to look up.</p>
        <p>The 20-year old Bilal Oliver, a  rhythm-and-blues singer with jazz training, turned in an unfocused but charmingly weird blues; Dianne Reeves and Dr. John (a first-time pairing) sang together nicely, albeit in a self-consciously show-biz way, on ''Come Rain or Come Shine.'' The Count Basie Orchestra, led by Grover Mitchell, played immaculate, tight and flavorless versions of Basie arrangements from the late 30's.</p>
        <p>But the evening's best music by far, the raucous, fiercely concentrated McCollough Sons of Thunder, a seven-trombone brass band from Harlem's House of Prayer for All People, was restricted to a five-minute finale with the house lights up and all hands onstage. Too bad. Still, squeezing it in at the last minute served a crucial purpose: the audience needed a strong pickup for the journey home.</p>
