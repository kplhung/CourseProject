        <p>Several million workers joined or were forced to acquiesce to a one-day national strike today to protest President Fernando de la Rua's economic austerity policies and Argentina's 14 percent unemployment rate.</p>
        <p>The strike, the largest in four years, represented a rare show of unity by the fractious labor movement and the most serious challenge to Mr. de la Rua's deficit-cutting policies since he took office in December.</p>
        <p>The walkout occurred at an inopportune time for the Argentine president, who is planning a trip to the United States early next week to see President Clinton and promote Argentine investments to Wall Street executives who have cooled to the country's prospects in recent years.</p>
        <p>Major cities and much of the countryside were paralyzed as thousands of railroad, subway, bus, truck and airline workers joined the walkout. Bonfires were set, bridges blocked, and buses and taxicabs dented or otherwise damaged by workers.</p>
        <p>More than 50 people were arrested. Thousands of stores closed, as many people decided to take a long weekend. Courts closed, and hospital emergency rooms had skeletal staffs. Uncollected garbage lined streets and shopping areas.</p>
        <p>In small demonstrations, workers beat drums, set off firecrackers and, in a few incidents, threw rocks at the police.</p>
        <p>''What the people want is work,'' said Rodolfo Daer, head of the General Labor Confederation, the largest workers' group. ''What the government needs to understand is that the people are demanding a change in direction.''</p>
        <p>The government tried to limit the damage by offering to open talks with the unions, businessmen, opposition governors and the Roman Catholic Church to reach some kind of consensus on economic policy.</p>
        <p>''In place of violence we need dialogue,'' Mr. de la Rua told reporters. ''But in order to have dialogue, we need not have violence.''</p>
        <p>The strike was planned to protest a $938 million cut in public spending, or 2 percent of the government budget. The spending plan, announced two weeks ago, is intended to meet International Monetary Fund guidelines and retain access to a $7.2 billion emergency credit line from the fund.</p>
        <p>The austerity package includes salary cuts for national government workers of 12 to 15 percent, reducing public retirement payments and  bans on public workers' earning salaries while receiving state pensions from previous positions.</p>
        <p>The latest round of cuts was imposed on top of $1.4 billion in cuts initiated by the de la Rua administration in its first weeks in office. All told, the spending cuts and a $2 billion tax increase are intended to bring down interest rates and keep the federal deficit under $4.5 billion this year, or one-third below the 1999 total.</p>
        <p>The economy has responded slowly to the medicine, as the national mood grows increasingly sour over a recession that has already run for two years. Last week, Mr. de la Rua lowered projections of a 4 percent growth rate this year to 3.5 percent, an anemic comeback after losing 3 percent in 1999.</p>
        <p>Independent economists expect this year to register an even lower  growth rate, 2.5 percent, far below that of Chile and Brazil, the other major economies in the region. With its currency tied to the strong dollar, Argentina lags behind its neighbors in exports. And with unemployment reaching 20 percent or more in poorer provinces with financially weak local governments, labor and social unrest is building in the countryside. Farmers who are seeking easier credit are threatening an extensive work action this month.</p>
        <p>Mr. de la Rua is urging patience, arguing that his policies need time to increase competitiveness on trade and investor and consumer confidence. His supporters point to recent developments that suggest that the economy might finally be ready to recover. Tax receipts, exports and imports showed signs of a pickup last month. A recent strengthening of the euro should help exports to Europe.</p>
        <p>In a move that promises to cut government finance costs $200 million, Argentina this week completed a successful debt swap of old Brady bonds for debt with lower interest.</p>
        <p>The general strike today was the second since Mr. de la Rua took office. But it was much bigger than the splintered work action in February, which aimed to prevent changes in the labor law that were intended to lower labor costs for businesses. Congress eventually passed changes, anyway.</p>
        <p>The unions are also upset over a decree that promises to deregulate the health industry gradually, expanding private health insurance to the detriment of a union-based health-insurance system. The current system is a cash cow for union leaders.</p>
