        <p>Editorial urges New York State Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno, to act on campaign finance reform; deplores legislators' conversion of campaign contributions to personal use</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Contributors planning to send a check to their New York State legislators should now consider this: Their money could be going to feed the office cat, as it did in one state senator's case last year. Or maybe $2,000 would pay another senator's country club dues. The list of ways legislators have spent their campaign bank accounts, now appearing on the Board of Elections Web site, also runs to restaurants or luxury sport utility vehicles or box seats at the Saratoga races.</p>
        <p>Such revelations should have prompted some embarrassment in Albany, but over the years state leaders have become adept at proclaiming the need for campaign finance reform and then smugly letting the issue slide for another session. With Albany's lawmakers primed to go home next week, once again this crucial matter has somehow lost its way. At this point the Assembly has passed a campaign finance reform package. Gov. George Pataki's own proposal has been languishing for a year. The next step is up to the Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno. He promised on Jan. 12 that his chamber would have its own version in a few weeks. But now, more than 20 weeks later, Mr. Bruno's bill on campaign reform has yet to appear.</p>

        <p>Such revelations should have prompted some embarrassment in Albany, but over the years state leaders have become adept at proclaiming the need for campaign finance reform and then smugly letting the issue slide for another session. With Albany's lawmakers primed to go home next week, once again this crucial matter has somehow lost its way. At this point the Assembly has passed a campaign finance reform package. Gov. George Pataki's own proposal has been languishing for a year. The next step is up to the Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno. He promised on Jan. 12 that his chamber would have its own version in a few weeks. But now, more than 20 weeks later, Mr. Bruno's bill on campaign reform has yet to appear.</p>
        <p>For limiting the use of campaign funds, even public interest groups have little hope that this year's Legislature will tighten such an accommodating law. So far the state Board of Elections has promised only to consider investigating the spending of campaign funds on cat food and other items.</p>
        <p>New York law that prohibits personal use of political contributions is so carefully loose that the best hope for cleaning out Albany's funding stables this year is that legislators will be embarrassed enough to stitch up the other gaping holes in the campaign finance laws. Such legislation would include banning soft money, drastically lowering the state's campaign contribution limits, beefing up disclosure and enforcement and providing public financing that would allow average New Yorkers to run for office.</p>
        <p>At this late date such reforms depend on Mr. Bruno, who did a service by imposing a voluntary ban on gifts to his members but has spent over $4,000 of his campaign money from last year to buy a pool cover and spruce up a recreation area at his farm. This is the kind of tampering with public trust that should push the Senate leader and his colleagues into a frenzy of reform.</p>
