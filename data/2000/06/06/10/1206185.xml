        <p>Jason Tyner attended Texas A &amp; M, the chief rival of the University of Texas, but he reserves proper respect for the former Longhorn hero Roger Clemens.</p>
        <p>''He's pretty much as big as they come down there,'' said Tyner, the Mets' rookie left fielder and a native of Beaumont, Tex. ''He's up there with Nolan Ryan as far as big-time power pitchers.''</p>
        <p>Clemens has not shown the same respect to players from A &amp; M. It is part of the Clemens legend that in his younger days he would drill any hitter who had played for the Aggies. The Yankees' Chuck Knoblauch experienced this.</p>
        <p>But when the 23-year-old Tyner stood in against Clemens as the first hitter of the game last night, he was not looking at the same pitcher who started winning Cy Young awards when Tyner was 9. Clemens did not hit Tyner. He could not do much with him at all.</p>
        <p>Clemens labored for five innings last night as the Mets blasted the Yankees, 12-2, and Tyner was a prime irritant. He reached base three times against Clemens, twice with hits, and he scored two runs.</p>
        <p>''That was by far the most fun I've ever had on a baseball field,'' Tyner said.</p>
        <p>Tyner -- who compared the Yankees-Mets rivalry to the one between A &amp; M and Texas, but ''magnified by 1,000 times'' -- said he expected to be nervous when the game started. When his name was announced as the leadoff hitter, he was greeted with ''the loudest boo I've ever heard.''</p>
        <p>Then he took a moment to take in the aura of Clemens.</p>
        <p>''I stepped in the box and I kind of looked up,'' Tyner said. ''I usually don't look at the pitcher, but for some reason, I was like, 'Geez, that's Roger Clemens.' I was excited. I don't think it can get any better, to be honest -- in my first week, facing Roger Clemens in Yankee Stadium in front of 50, 60,000 people. That's special.''</p>
        <p>Tyner worked a full count against Clemens, who threw him only fastballs, and fouled off another pitch before whacking one to left-center field. Bernie Williams was playing in on Tyner, who has not homered since high school, and he could not reach the hit, which fell for a double. It was Tyner's fourth hit -- and first for extra bases -- since he was called up on Monday.</p>
        <p>''He's not scared, that's for sure,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said of Tyner. ''He started the game off the right way.''</p>
        <p>The game was scoreless when Tyner bunted as the leadoff man in the third. Jorge Posada's throw was high and pulled Tino Martinez off first base, and the throwing error allowed Tyner to reach base.</p>
        <p>Clemens was aware of Tyner's speed, throwing over to first base twice in the third inning and throwing wildly on a pickoff attempt in the sixth. All three times Tyner led off an inning, he reached base.</p>
        <p>Tyner finished 2 for 6 with two runs scored and is batting .294 in four games. He also contributed a sliding catch in the third inning to rob Williams after Derek Jeter had led off with a single.</p>
        <p>''He's playing well,'' Valentine said. ''It's fun to watch him.''</p>
        <p>Tyner gives the Mets a presence they did not have before he arrived, a stolen-base threat who can hit. Because he is an important part of their future and has minor league options remaining, he will not stay with the Mets in a reserve role if he slumps.</p>
        <p>''While he's here, he's going to play,'' General Manager Steve Phillips said. ''He's not here to be a role player. He's here to see if he can play and assume the position.''</p>
        <p>As for Tyner, he never expected to be with the Mets so soon. Facing the Baltimore Orioles' Mike Mussina in his first game on Monday, Tyner had to collect himself, asking, ''Where did the time go?''</p>
        <p>Only two years ago, he was the Mets' No. 1 draft choice. Only three months ago, he was in Class AAA Norfolk, with the future Hall of Famer Rickey Henderson blocking his path to New York.</p>
        <p>But Tyner has hit ever since he was drafted, and Henderson was given his release last month. Tyner's time had come.</p>
        <p>''I was just hoping they would call me up in September, maybe pinch-run and stuff,'' Tyner said. ''Things, I guess, worked out for me.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>JASON TYNER is one of 10 Mets who had never played at Yankee Stadium before last night. LENNY HARRIS, who has played in the major leagues since 1988 but had never played in the Bronx, took a camera to preserve the memory. So did TODD ZEILE, who often carries a hand-held video camera to record special occasions in an arrangement he has with Fox-TV.</p>
        <p>GARY LAROCQUE, the Mets' assistant general manager for amateur scouting, is in California meeting with the Mets' No. 1 draft choice, the Loyola Marymount left-hander BILLY TRABER. Traber, who was taken with the 16th pick over all, is expected to seek a bonus comparable to the one received by last year's 16th pick, Colorado's JASON JENNINGS. He received $1.675 million.</p>
        <p>The right-hander PAUL WILSON was not sharp in his start for Class AAA Norfolk on Thursday, allowing four runs in four and two-thirds innings, but he said he felt fine after being skipped with shoulder soreness. But Wilson is not close to being considered for a call-up. The left-hander BOBBY M. JONES has been pitching well lately, with a 5-3 record and a 4.01 earned run average, and he could be the next pitcher the Mets recall.</p>
