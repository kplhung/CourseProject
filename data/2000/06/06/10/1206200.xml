        <p>Representative Rick A. Lazio has appointed a veteran strategist for conservative causes to run his campaign for the Senate, campaign officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's choice is Bill Dal Col, 44, a childhood friend from Long Island who managed Steve Forbes's two unsuccessful bids for the Republican presidential nomination, campaign officials said.</p>
        <p>Speaking to reporters following an event in Ulster County late yesterday, Mr. Lazio said Mr. Dal Col brought ''the depth of experience, unrivaled frankly,'' to his Senate campaign, according to The Associated Press.</p>
        <p>''He has national perspective,'' Mr. Lazio said. ''He knows New York. He's got the ideal combination of political skills, communication skills, organizational skills to help pull the operation of this campaign effectively.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dal Col, who is expected to join the campaign within a couple of days, will lead a staff that includes other veterans of national races, including a political strategist who worked on Senator John McCain's presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dal Col did not return telephone calls to his Virginia office.</p>
        <p>Between Mr. Forbes's presidential campaigns in 1996 and 2000, Mr. Dal Col was president of Americans for Hope, Growth and Opportunity, a nonprofit group founded by Mr. Forbes that advocates a ban on all abortions, school choice for parents and the dismantling of the Internal Revenue Service.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's Democratic opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has won the endorsement of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, has said she will make abortion rights a campaign theme. Mr. Lazio has said he favors abortion rights, but opposes public financing of abortions and a late-term procedure critics call ''partial birth abortion.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio released the first television advertisement for his campaign yesterday. Two other advertisements made by outside groups have already been shown. The 60-second Lazio advertisement, ''Introduction,'' shows him talking about his upbringing and political life. It will be broadcast this weekend on stations north of New York City.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton also released a new campaign advertisement in which  she mentions her visits to all 62 New York counties, and promises to promote high-tech jobs and to practice fiscal responsibility by reducing the  national debt.</p>
        <p>Political strategists said Mr. Dal Col appealed to Mr. Lazio in several ways.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dal Col has the experience of running major campaigns, but is also political kindred from Suffolk County, which is symbolically important in a campaign in which Mr. Lazio has sought to contrast his New York roots with Mrs. Clinton's background. The first lady moved to a house in Chappaqua five months ago.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dal Col, who ran unsuccessfully for the State Assembly in 1982, was a councilman in Babylon in the 1980's. Mr. Lazio grew up in West Islip and lives in Brightwaters, both in Suffolk County.</p>
        <p>''Bill is a native New Yorker who is a childhood friend of Lazio's, and they know each other well,'' said Greg Mueller, a senior adviser to Mr. Forbes during his 2000 campaign. ''Lazio doesn't have time for that 'getting to know you.' And Bill knows New York politics backward, forward and sideways. He's lived in New York and he knows all the players.''</p>
        <p>This week, Mr. Lazio also named several other people to his staff, campaign officials said. Eileen Long, the chief of staff to Lt. Gov. Mary O. Donohue and the daughter of Michael Long, the chairman of the Conservative Party, will be political director; Patrick McCarthy, a communications and legislative aide to Mr. Pataki, will be deputy communications director; and Carlyle Gregory, a longtime consultant to Mr. Lazio, will be a political consultant.</p>
