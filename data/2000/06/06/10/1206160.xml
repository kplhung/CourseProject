        <p>The families of five young children eligible for state-financed Medicaid dental coverage filed a federal lawsuit on Thursday accusing Connecticut's Department of Social Services of not providing enough money to the program and imperiling the health of thousands of children statewide.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit is similar to suits filed in the last 18 months on behalf of families in New York, Massachusetts and New Hampshire who have struggled to find dentists willing to accept Medicaid.</p>
        <p>About 150,000 Connecticut children, most from low-income families, are not getting proper dental care because the state-run Medicaid program reimburses dentists at rates so low that most doctors have stopped accepting it, said Jamey Bell, a lawyer with Greater Hartford Legal Assistance, which is representing the families.</p>
        <p>As in other states, Connecticut splits the cost of Medicaid, which provides low-income families with dental and other medical insurance, with the federal government. But the Connecticut families say the state's Medicaid payments are too low, and often take so long to process, that most dentists refuse to treat patients who rely on it.</p>
        <p>''Fewer kids are actually getting services, and access is worse,'' Ms. Bell said.</p>
        <p>Only four dental insurers in Connecticut -- Blue Care Family Plan, Community Health Network, Physicians Health Services and Preferred One -- now accept Medicaid, down from more than 10 in 1995, Ms. Bell said. Last year, 24 percent of Connecticut children eligible for Medicaid coverage received preventive dental care, she added, down from 29.7 percent in 1995.</p>
        <p>The families filed the lawsuit in Federal District Court in Hartford.</p>
        <p>Mary Carr of Waterbury, one of the three plaintiffs named in the lawsuit, said she had spent nearly two years searching for a dentist who would accept Medicaid for a root canal for her 5-year-old grandson. None of the dentists she contacted would accept Medicaid to pay the $250 for anesthesia, she said. ''There's no way I could raise that amount of money,'' said Ms. Carr, 54. Meanwhile, the boy, identified in the suit as I. N. Brown, ''doesn't eat properly because he can't chew,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Another plaintiff, Theresa Hall, said she had searched since November 1998 for a dentist to treat her daughter's decayed molar. Karen and Jim Poulin, of Manchester, whose two adopted sons are covered by Medicaid, have been rejected by 16 dentist offices since early last year.</p>
        <p>Richard Blumenthal, Connecticut's attorney general, said today he had not had a chance to review the lawsuit and declined to discuss it. A spokesman for Gov. John G. Rowland did not return three calls seeking comment.</p>
        <p>The suit taps into a growing frustration among patients, health care advocates and orthodontists at the increasing difficulty in using Medicaid by families reliant on it.</p>
        <p>In 1995, fewer than one in five children in the country eligible for Medicaid received preventive dental care, according to a study issued two weeks ago by the United States surgeon general, Dr. David Satcher. The study also found that the vast majority of acute dental decay occurred in only 25 percent of the nation's children, particularly those from poor families. The disparity is being made worse, the study found, by a decline in the number of dental insurers willing to participate in state-run Medicaid programs.</p>
        <p>Many dentists say Medicaid, which pays them about half as much as private insurers do for the same services, is not worth honoring.</p>
        <p>''When you end up dealing with the state, you have to wait a very long time to get paid,'' said the office manager for Dr. Larry L. Venham in Windham, who would not give his name. Also, the office manager said, Medicaid patients tend to miss far more appointments than other patients.</p>
        <p>Like many other dentists, Dr. Venham stopped taking Medicaid about two years ago, after the state began requiring that dentists verify each patients' Medicaid eligibility by calling an automated phone number that made processing claims a headache, the office manager said. ''That's when we bailed out,'' he said. ''The whole thing is a nightmare, and it's not worth it.''</p>
        <p>The state will spend $26 million this year for Medicaid clients' dental care, said Claudette Beaulieu, a spokeswoman for the Department of Social Services. She said spending figures for previous years were not available. ''Access for dental services has been an issue for Medicaid across the country; it's not just in Connecticut,'' Ms. Beaulieu said.</p>
        <p>In February 1999, the New York Dental Society, a professional association, sued the state, arguing that New York's Medicaid program reimbursed dentists at rates so low that they prevented most from treating Medicaid patients. Last month, the state agreed to settle the case by increasing its Medicaid financing by $573 million over four years, Ms. Bell said.</p>
        <p>Of the 17,000 dentists in the state, fewer than 1,200 handed in Medicaid claims in 1997, the State Health Department said last year.</p>
