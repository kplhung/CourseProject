        <p>Roger Clemens stepped off the mound in the sixth inning of last night's game at Yankee Stadium and walked steadily into a head wind of boos, the tempest of Yankee fans raging over his horrible performance against the Mets. Never accelerating his amble, Clemens crossed the first-base line, the discontent growing louder, reaching a high pitch before he disappeared into the dugout.</p>
        <p>Jason Tyner of the Mets, five days into his big-league career, was the first batter to get to Clemens, and Mike Piazza all but finished him with a grand slam in the third inning, as the Mets destroyed the Yankees, 12-2, in the opener of their three-game series, before 55,822.</p>
        <p>George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, left before the game was over. This afternoon the Yankees' Andy Pettitte will pitch against the Mets' Bobby J. Jones.</p>
        <p>Two events have occurred without fail in each of Clemens's three starts in the interleague series against the Mets since he joined the Yankees: Piazza has hit a home run, and Al Leiter has been the pitcher who beat him. Leiter allowed seven hits and two runs last night. Clemens has allowed 21 runs (20 earned) in 132/3  innings in the three games against the Mets.</p>
        <p>''I was as hacked off as anybody,'' Clemens (4-5) said. ''About the situation, hacked off the way things were turning out.''</p>
        <p>Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, said: ''You know he's hurting. He has the responsibility of knowing his team counts on him, and he had a game like he did tonight.''</p>
        <p>He wanted more. Clemens pulled into the Yankee Stadium parking lot in a sports utility vehicle at 5:45 p.m., long after the fans who wait outside the players' entrance had dispersed and just an hour and a half before the first pitch. Wearing denim golf shorts and a green polo shirt, Clemens strolled into the park all but unnoticed, a few fans turning with double-takes after he passed.</p>
        <p>Before he pitches, Clemens covers his body with a scentless balm called Red Hot to help him get ready, even on warm and muggy nights. He finished his warm-ups under a coating of sweat, walked to Monument Park, pressed a palm against Babe Ruth's plaque and took the field, at 37 the oldest starter on either team.</p>
        <p>The game's youngest player batted first: Tyner is tall and bat-handle thin, 23 years old, and he pushed Clemens to a full count before lining a game-opening double over the head of Bernie Williams in center field.</p>
        <p>Tyner did not score in the first inning, but he did scamper to third on a ground ball to Derek Jeter's right at shortstop, beating his throw. What the Yankees understood from this play is that Tyner is not afraid to take chances. Maybe this is what weighed on Clemens's psyche in the third inning, affecting all of his choices at the game's crossroads.</p>
        <p>Tyner pushed a bunt in front of home plate to open the third, the ball rolling perhaps 15 feet before catcher Jorge Posada grabbed it and threw to first -- high, taking Tino Martinez off the base. Tyner was on base, and the Yankees obsessed over him. Clemens came set, ready to pitch to Derek Bell, who had 4 hits in his last 54 at-bats (.074), and Clemens stepped off, watching Tyner. He threw a fastball and Bell swung through it; in fact, all six pitches Clemens threw to Bell in the at-bat were fastballs, the pitch most advantageous in throwing out runners.</p>
        <p>Clemens pitched out with his second delivery to Bell and Tyner wasn't moving. Clemens threw to first, pushing Tyner back, then pumped a fastball high to Bell; two balls and one strike.</p>
        <p>Tyner broke from first on the next pitch with a good jump, and Bell fouled off the ball. Clemens rushed his delivery and threw high, and with the count full, he rushed again, his fastball sailing out of the strike zone for a walk to the slump-ridden Bell.</p>
        <p>A killer walk. The Mets had first and second and nobody out in a scoreless game. Posada dropped Clemens's first pitch to Edgardo Alfonzo, the passed ball allowing both runners to advance, and Clemens eventually walked Alfonzo, loading the bases. Murmurs of anticipation followed Piazza as he walked to the plate.</p>
        <p>Clemens tried spinning a slider, down low. Piazza was ready, his left leg stiffening and serving as anchor for his swing, and the ball rocketed toward center field. Clemens's head jerked skyward as Piazza's drive carried over the fence. It was only the second grand slam Clemens has allowed in the 3,542 innings of his career, and it was the 11th hit by Piazza in his career.</p>
        <p>The Mets led, 4-0, Leiter (7-1) was pitching effectively, and the rest of the game seemed unnecessary, other than to inflame the feelings of Yankee fans toward Clemens. He allowed single runs in the fourth and fifth innings, the Mets taking a 6-2 lead. Tyner started the sixth by pulling a single through the right side of the infield, haunting Clemens, taking second when Clemens bounced a pick-off attempt into the stands.</p>
        <p>Bell doubled inside the right field line and Tyner scored, and before Alfonzo batted, Posada turned and looked toward the dugout, wiping his brow with his gloved hand.</p>
        <p>Clemens pitched to Alfonzo, there was a sharp crack, and in an instant Alfonzo's drive landed over the center field wall. Now Torre stepped onto the field to relieve his pitcher.</p>
        <p>The booing began, and Clemens spoke to the infielders on the mound as they waited for Torre. Clemens suggested later that perhaps the Mets' runners at second had been relaying the identity of his pitches, that the extra day of rest had bothered him.</p>
        <p>Before Clemens departed, the manager held him around the waist and spoke into his right ear, knowing what Clemens would hear on the way back to the dugout. ''We'll get this thing figured out,'' Torre said.</p>
        <p>The booing was scathing, the message clear: He had flopped in a game that meant more to Yankee fans than any other regular-season contest he has pitched.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>The Yankees are expected to make a decision today on second baseman CHUCK KNOBLAUCH. If his left forearm feels better, he could be in the lineup against the Mets. If not, he could be placed on the disabled list.</p>
