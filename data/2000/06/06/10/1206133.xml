        <p>Three weeks before Mexicans go to the polls in their most tightly contested presidential race ever, President Clinton warmly received his Mexican counterpart, President Ernesto Zedillo, today, and White House officials expressed confidence in the integrity of the electoral process.</p>
        <p>Emerging from their 11th bilateral meeting since 1994, Mr. Clinton praised Mr. Zedillo for stabilizing his nation's economy and advancing the process of trade integration with the United States and Canada.</p>
        <p>Mindful, no doubt, of Mexicans' sensitivities to American meddling in their affairs, Mr. Clinton ducked a request for his opinion of the July 2 election for a Zedillo successor.</p>
        <p>''I think the Mexican people will vote and make their own decision,'' Mr. Clinton said, chuckling. In a nod to the race under way for the White House, he added: ''It's just like this election -- I am just an observer now; I am not running for anything.''</p>
        <p>But White House officials privately said they were pleased with preparations for the Mexican vote, which they said could provide Mexico with its most free elections since Mr. Zedillo's party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, first grasped the presidency in 1929 and, through occasional machinations and electoral fraud, never let go.</p>
        <p>Polls show the PRI candidate, Francisco Labastida Ochoa, in a close race with Vicente Fox Quesada of the center-right National Action Party. The competition, which also includes a leftist politician, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, has narrowed under an electoral reform process that designated an independent election agency to oversee the vote and efforts by leading news media to balance their coverage.</p>
        <p>A senior administration official said the United States does not have ''a systemic worry'' about the vote. ''We're confident in the process and in the institutions that have been created to run the elections,'' the official said. ''That doesn't mean there couldn't be a problem if there is a very close election.''</p>
        <p>Despite the American optimism, an international group of election monitors affiliated with the Democratic Party warned today that Mexican politicians, especially those in Mr. Zedillo's party, may be using federal assistance programs to curry favor with voters.</p>
        <p>The delegation, from the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, released a six-page report suggesting that a rural welfare program by the Social Development Ministry and several others operated by the Department of Agriculture are being manipulated.</p>
        <p>''Unfortunately, it is widely believed that the closeness of the election has led to certain practices, particularly by the ruling party, which are reminiscent of past elections,'' said the report, which was released in Mexico.</p>
        <p>Given the PRI's history of fraud, some observers assert that it must actually lose the presidential vote to prove to skeptics that the process is now fair.</p>
        <p>''For democracy to finally become a reality in Mexico, the Institutional Revolutionary Party needs to give up the power it has held since its foundation in 1929, ceding to the opposition,'' Mario Vargas Llosa, the Peruvian author, wrote in the Mexican newspaper, Reforma. ''Mexico is still not a democratic society.''</p>
        <p>Whether or not fraud occurs, the temptation to denounce it will be especially strong if the the vote-count is close, analysts said.</p>
        <p>''If the election is close and the PRI claims victory by a few percentage points there will be a hard time convincing a lot of people that the election is fair,'' said Peter Hakim, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a think tank of hemispheric leaders.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Zedillo, in remarks in New York on Thursday, rejected that notion, saying there are enough safeguards to ensure that whoever wins, wins ''even if it is only by one vote.''  He tacitly admitted that the process by which he took office was flawed. ''Next July 2, Mexico will have legal, fair and transparent elections,'' he said. ''The next president will have democratic legitimacy.''</p>
        <p>Many American analysts agreed.</p>
        <p>Delal Baer, a Mexico expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said there were lingering questions about ''pork-barrel politics,'' but added, ''Nobody is questioning the fundamental integrity of the process.''</p>
