        <p>Transkaryotic Therapies Inc. won a round in its patent fight with the biotechnology giant Amgen Inc. yesterday when a judge ruled that Transkaryotic did not infringe on one of Amgen's patents covering its best- selling drug.</p>
        <p>But company executives and analysts said that the ruling, by Judge William G. Young of the Federal District Court in Boston, did not disqualify other Amgen patents and that the trial still had several weeks to go.</p>
        <p>Amgen has accused Transkaryotic and its partner, Aventis S.A., a European drug company, of infringing five patents covering erythropoietin. The drug is an anemia treatment and has global sales of $4 billion a year, mostly by Amgen and its licensee, Johnson &amp; Johnson. Transkaryotic and Aventis contend they produce the drug using a method that differs from that used by Amgen.</p>
        <p>Erythropoietin stimulates the production of red blood cells and is used to treat anemia in patients undergoing kidney dialysis or cancer chemotherapy. Amgen produces the drug by splicing the human erythropoietin gene into hamster cells, which then produce the protein. Transkaryotic turns on the gene for erythropoietin that is present in all human cells but normally dormant. The switched-on human cells are grown in a culture to produce the drug.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's ruling came after Transkaryotic and Aventis argued that Amgen, which had finished presenting its case, had not proved it, and asked that infringement charges on three of the five patents be thrown out.</p>
        <p>Judge Young ruled that Transkaryotic and Aventis had not infringed one patent dealing with Amgen's process of producing erythropoietin. On a second patent dealing with the structure of the drug, he ruled that Transkaryotic had not literally infringed on the patent because its version of erythropoietin has one less amino acid than Amgen's. He left open the possibility, however, that he might later find that difference insignificant. He declined to declare noninfringement on the third patent. He also said that the rulings might be revised over the weekend.</p>
        <p>In April, Judge Young ruled that Transkaryotic had infringed one of Amgen's patents. Since Amgen needs to prove infringement on only one patent to block Transkaryotic from selling the drug, Transkaryotic must now prove in trial that the patent is invalid or unenforceable.</p>
        <p>The ruling yesterday ''narrows the scope'' of what Transkaryotic must do to win the case, said Eric Schmidt, an analyst with SG Cowen. But he added: ''It's still very, very early. I don't know if you can say that anyone is winning.''</p>
        <p>Shares of Transkaryotic soared $11.1875, or 35 percent, yesterday, closing at $42.875.. Amgen's stock fell $3.0625, or 4.7 percent, to $62.625.</p>
