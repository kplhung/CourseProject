        <p>On the eve of the 132nd Belmont Stakes, the trainer of the longest shot in the field, the colt Hugh Hefner at 50-1, looked over the 11 horses entered and said rather hopefully, ''I don't think there are any superstars in there.''</p>
        <p>Certainly not Hugh Hefner, who has not won a race in eight months, ran 13th in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile and ran sixth when he got a shot at this year's Triple Crown class in the Preakness three weeks ago.</p>
        <p>But the trainer, Marty Jones, clung to the belief that his horse had one thing generally lacking in the Belmont field today: speed. ''If they'll leave him alone and he can get a nice comfortable lead and relax out there,'' he said, ''we could surprise some folks.''</p>
        <p>Surprise became the watchword of this year's Belmont after it lost the two superstars of the moment among 3-year-olds: Fusaichi Pegasus, winner of the Kentucky Derby, and Red Bullet, winner of the Preakness. For them, the Belmont loomed as a duel that might even decide which one deserved to be elected Horse of the Year.</p>
        <p>But in the three weeks since the Preakness, just when Belmont Park was licking its chops over the prospect of a duel of the celebrities after three straight years of suspense with the Triple Crown on the line, the unthinkable happened: Red Bullet was withdrawn when his owner, Frank Stronach, decided that his horse needed more rest. And Fusaichi Pegasus was withdrawn when his trainer, Neil Drysdale, discovered that he had cut his right front foot on his stall door.</p>
        <p>Goodbye, superstars.</p>
        <p>But on the flip side, the race was now wide open, though largely short of survivors of the Triple Crown trail. The new favorite became Aptitude, who finished second to Pegasus in the Derby but sat out the Preakness.</p>
        <p>He is surrounded by rivals with similarly incomplete resumes: Impeachment, the only horse in the Belmont field to have run in both the Derby and the Preakness (third in both); Unshaded, who until recently was not believed to be experienced enough to run in the classics; Commendable, who has not won since his first race last August and who ran 17th in the Derby; Wheelaway, who ran fifth in the Derby but skipped the Preakness; and Postponed, who skipped both but won the Peter Pan.</p>
        <p>They are scheduled to go to the post at 5:27 p.m. on a sunny day with the temperature pushing 90 degrees and with ABC television broadcasting. The first race of the day is to go off at 12:30 p.m.; the Belmont, with a purse of $1 million, will be the 9th of 11 races. Estimates of the crowd were difficult to come by, perhaps as many as 70,000 or as few as 50,000, but most likely not nearly so impressive as last year's record attendance of 85,818.</p>
        <p>Aptitude was out for some final exercise in the sunshine yesterday morning with his trainer, Bobby Frankel, along with most of his rivals and their handlers and even jockeys.</p>
        <p>The trainers seemed to be focusing on the lack of early speed in the race and on how it might affect the outcome when the 11 colts came running or lurching down the homestretch after running most of the mile and a half.</p>
        <p>D. Wayne Lukas, who won the Derby and the Preakness last year with Charismatic but lost the Belmont in the final yards, watched Commendable galloping a mile and a half around the main track and said he expected Pat Day to keep the colt close to the pace.</p>
        <p>''He probably won't be pressing the pace,'' Lukas said, ''but he will be up close.''</p>
        <p>Impeachment also galloped a mile and a half over the main track, prompting his trainer, Todd Pletcher, to observe: ''Just like the race. Once around.''</p>
        <p>Then, focusing on the logistics of running three grinding races in five weeks, especially for a horse who likes to run behind and then rally with one big rush, Pletcher said:</p>
        <p>''To get a mile and a half, you need a certain level of fitness. In this case, five weeks between races would not have been in his best interests. He's a lazy kind of horse, who doesn't like to do much in the morning.''</p>
        <p>Pletcher's ''lazy'' horse will still have to last a mile and a half, a distance none of the colts has been asked to run before. But the rationale was expressed by Jerry Hollendorfer, who trains Globalize, the winner of the Golden State Mile and the Turfway Park Spiral, who finished second in the Lexington and third in the Peter Pan.</p>
        <p>''He's got enough in him to go a mile and a half,'' Hollendorfer said after Globalize galloped a mile and three-quarters. ''He's plenty fit. We're not training him any differently for this race than we did for the Peter Pan. He usually gallops about a mile and five-eighths every morning, so the distance should not be a problem.''</p>
