        <p>OMAR MINAYA stood by the visitors' dugout at Yankee Stadium yesterday. Minaya, the Mets' assistant general manager, chatted with players and reporters and soaked up the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>I walked over to Minaya, and we exchanged pleasantries. He said something about how time flies, how things change.</p>
        <p>At this time last season the Mets were in a shambles. Before the first game of their first meeting with the Yankees, Bobby Bonilla and Brian McRae arrived at Yankee Stadium and learned they had been placed on irrevocable waivers. Then after the second game, the Mets dismissed three coaches. Manager Bobby Valentine followed that by announcing that if the Mets' tailspin continued, he should be dismissed as well. That put in motion the most bizarre four-month stretch of baseball in the Mets' history -- a stretch that ended with the Mets facing Atlanta for the National League pennant.</p>
        <p>''We are better today after 59 games than we were last year after the same number of games,'' Minaya said last night before the Mets and the Yankees met for the first time this season. ''Last June the last thing on my mind was Atlanta and a championship series. There was a lot going on: we had coaches we had to let go, the team was on a losing streak and we were trying to put the pieces back together.''</p>
        <p>So last night the Mets crushed the Yankees. On the way to a 12-2 victory they pummeled Roger Clemens, pounding out nine runs on 10 hits in a barrage that underlined the severity of the Yankees' pitching woes.</p>
        <p>Mike Piazza hit a grand slam off of Clemens and Edgardo Alfonzo hit a two-run homer.</p>
        <p>In an odd way, the roots of the Mets' confidence this season go back to Oct. 20, 1999, in Atlanta, Game 6 of the National League Championship Series.</p>
        <p>Minaya remembered how the Braves went ahead, 5-0, in the first inning by routing Al Leiter. ''I was dejected,'' Minaya said. ''I left to go to the bathroom and the next thing you know I was standing in a corridor and we were coming back. I told myself, 'I ain't moving from here -- this is a good-luck spot.' I stood there the rest of the game.''</p>
        <p>When the Mets tied the game, 7-7, in the seventh inning, I left the Turner Field press box, went downstairs and saw Minaya standing in a corridor amid Atlanta fans, looking up at a television monitor.</p>
        <p>We stood there, without really speaking, but thinking about the improbable history unfolding. Then the Mets took a one-run lead in the eighth inning; we watched Atlanta tie the score in the bottom of the eighth. The Mets took a 9-8 lead in the top of the 10th inning.</p>
        <p>In Minaya's mind, that was how close the Mets came to facing the Yankees in the World Series, to having the chance to settle a deeply rooted grudge, to heal the deep wounds inflicted by history.</p>
        <p>''We were two outs away from going to that seventh game,'' Minaya said. ''The general sense, looking at the faces of the Braves after this comeback, was that we were going to beat them that seventh game. It was very exciting. I'm a New Yorker, so a subway series meant so much to me, especially being part of one of the teams in the series.''</p>
        <p>But Atlanta tied the score in the bottom of the 10th. In the bottom of the 11th -- well, you know the sad history: a leadoff double; the runner moves to third on a sacrifice bunt. A pair of intentional walks to load the bases and finally a walk to Andruw Jones to force in the winning run. Minaya and I shook hands and took different routes to the Mets' clubhouse.</p>
        <p>Yesterday that game seemed like a century ago; the two ballparks, Shea Stadium and Yankee Stadium, seemingly so close last October, seemed oceans apart. The Mets and the Yankees were back at the beginning; back at the mouth of a long, seemingly endless tunnel.</p>
        <p>Last October Minaya was deflated. ''When something hasn't happened in 40 years, and in your mind you're two outs away from it happening,'' Minaya said, ''you're disappointed. But as a baseball man, you pick yourself up over the winter and you go at it again.''</p>
        <p>There's such a long way to go. The Yankees need pitching help desperately. The Mets need another good player.</p>
        <p>''Right now,'' Minaya said, ''teams are jockeying for position until they make a decision on how they are going to improve the club. I guarantee you, whoever wins the championship is not going to win the championship with the team they have today.''</p>
        <p>For the first time in a long time, that's truer for the Yankees than it is for the Mets.</p>
