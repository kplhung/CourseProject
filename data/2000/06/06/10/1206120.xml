        <p>Efforts are growing in state legislatures and in Congress to help inmates overcome the obstacles they face in obtaining DNA evidence that might exonerate them.</p>
        <p>But those efforts are facing continued reluctance by some prosecutors and victims' rights groups to expand the rights of criminal defendants and prolong an appeals process they say is already too slow.</p>
        <p>The proposals on DNA testing come as a rash of cases in which death row inmates have been set free has led even some ardent supporters of capital punishment to question whether states are at risk of executing innocent prisoners. Advocates would like to see Congress pass legislation requiring DNA testing in cases that might prove exculpatory.</p>
        <p>For now, most inmates have no statutory right to post-conviction DNA testing, often leaving it to their lawyers to fight prosecutors to gain access to any remaining evidence from cases before DNA testing was routinely available. And prisoners still face strict time limits in most state courts that bar motions for new trials based on new evidence, even if DNA testing did not become available until long after their conviction.</p>
        <p>Supporters of the measures say they are frustrated by the obstacles.</p>
        <p>''People are only just now beginning to really focus on this,'' said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, who has sponsored legislation to provide for post-conviction DNA testing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Leahy, a former prosecutor, said it would be unconscionable for prosecutors not to turn over fingerprint evidence to defense lawyers, and he said old biological evidence that could be DNA tested should be no different.</p>
        <p>''DNA is the fingerprint evidence of the 21st century,'' he said, ''and it's taking a lot of people time to catch up to that.''</p>
        <p>New York, Illinois and Minnesota are the only states that have laws specifically allowing inmates to ask judges to order DNA testing of evidence using technology not available at the time of trial.</p>
        <p>A few other states, including Tennessee, Arizona and Oklahoma, have passed laws allowing some post-conviction DNA testing.</p>
        <p>In California, the State Senate voted unanimously last month to allow inmates to seek testing if the relevant evidence or testing technology were not previously available and to require officials to retain biological evidence.</p>
        <p>And in Texas, which leads the nation in executions, State Senator Rodney Ellis, Democrat of Houston, announced on Thursday that he would introduce legislation to let inmates seek post-conviction DNA testing and require the preservation of biological evidence.</p>
        <p>Though the trend in Texas has been to speed the pace of executions, Mr. Ellis's proposals have already won the support of a leading Senate Republican, David Sibley of Waco, who predicted swift action on the bill.</p>
        <p>Some of the new laws are limited, such as a statute passed this year in Washington State that applies only to prisoners on death row or serving life terms without parole and that leaves it to the discretion of prosecutors whether to allow DNA testing.</p>
        <p>The new law in Oklahoma gives the Indigent Defense System, a statewide public defender, the right to test old biological evidence.</p>
        <p>But Jim Bednar, the executive director of the system, said inmates whose tests might prove they are innocent are still at the mercy of local prosecutors who can refuse to reopen the case. A proposal that would have allowed defense lawyers a new route to take DNA test results to a judge was opposed, Mr. Bednar said, by prosecutors and the state attorney general, and did not pass the Legislature.</p>
        <p>In Virginia and Florida, which trail only Texas in the number of people executed since the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976, there has been no serious legislative consideration of post-conviction DNA testing.</p>
        <p>In other states, inmates face an inconsistent patchwork of laws and court rules that often limit access to the evidence needed for DNA testing, and in some cases, do not allow the governor to consider pardons even when DNA evidence casts doubt on a conviction.</p>
        <p>In 33 states, motions for new trials because of DNA or other new evidence must be filed no later than six months after final appeals, said Barry Scheck, a director of the Innocence Project, a New York advocacy group. This can be an insurmountable obstacle in older cases, before DNA testing was used.</p>
        <p>Often, Mr. Scheck said, it varies from county to county whether the prosecutor will even agree to turn over evidence -- such as hair, blood, saliva or semen -- so it can be tested.</p>
        <p>''There's too much inconsistency and pure chance,'' he said. ''These decisions should not be left up to the political process. Neutral, detached magistrates should make these judgments.''</p>
        <p>According to the National Institute of Justice, the research arm of the Justice Department, more than 60 inmates have been freed because of DNA evidence since the late 1980's, when courts began allowing such evidence. In Congress, hearings on the issue start next week in the Senate Judiciary Committee. Mr. Leahy has proposed giving inmates the right to seek DNA testing, requiring officials to retain biological evidence and withholding some federal money from states that fail to establish minimum standards for court-appointed lawyers in capital cases.</p>
        <p>President Clinton said he was ''favorably disposed'' toward the bill, and Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and the committee chairman, is expected to introduce his own, more limited bill.</p>
        <p>But support is not widespread. Vice President Al Gore, the presumed Democratic presidential nominee, says he approves of the goals of the Leahy bill but has not endorsed it, and his spokesman declined to say whether Mr. Gore would back any legislation on the issue.</p>
        <p>Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the expected Republican nominee, said last week that post-conviction DNA testing should be used when the results could bear on guilt. But Mr. Bush's aides refused to say whether he would support legislation -- either in Texas or Washington -- to make DNA testing available to inmates who currently cannot obtain it.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors see many post-conviction DNA testing requests as delaying tactics, and they note that in many cases a good deal of other evidence points to the inmate's guilt.</p>
        <p>''I don't think anyone wants to see an innocent person in prison, but that said, we view with great suspicion some of these requests,'' said Richard E. Trodden, president of the Virginia Association of Commonwealth Attorneys, and the commonwealth attorney in Arlington County.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors would want to see any law written ''as narrowly as possible, so we just don't open the floodgates,'' Mr. Trodden said.</p>
        <p>''We have to make sure such claims don't violate the principle of finality, which is so important to the criminal justice system,'' he said, ''and allows the victim's family to close a horrible, horrible chapter.''</p>
        <p>The issue was highlighted last week in Texas when Governor Bush, who supports the death penalty, agreed to a 30-day reprieve to allow for DNA testing in the case of Ricky McGinn, sentenced to die for the murder and rape of his 12-year-old stepdaughter. Defense lawyers hope the DNA testing might cast doubt on the rape conviction, without which prosecutors would not have been able to seek the death penalty.</p>
        <p>But lawyers who favor widened DNA testing say other Texas cases provide a starker illustration of the sort of obstacles there, and in other states, that block inmates from obtaining exculpatory DNA tests.</p>
        <p>In one case, A.B. Butler Jr. of Tyler, Tex., imprisoned since a 1983 rape conviction, was pardoned last week by Mr. Bush after DNA tests showing that evidence found on the victim did not come from Mr. Butler. Mr. Butler tried for seven years to obtain DNA tests but did not succeed until last year after he hired a new lawyer, Randy Schaffer of Houston.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors often fight tooth and nail to keep inmates from getting old biological evidence tested, said Mr. Schaffer, who won a pardon for another inmate, Kevin Byrd, in 1997, after DNA tests showed he had not committed the rape he had been convicted of 12 years earlier.</p>
        <p>Many times, the biological evidence needed for DNA tests has been thrown away or lost, Mr. Schaffer said, noting that soon after Mr. Byrd was released, court officials in Houston destroyed evidence from 50 rape cases.</p>
        <p>''I guess it was a good time to do a little spring cleaning,'' Mr. Schaffer said.</p>
