        <p>David Parsons makes dances that go down easy. They look good and they feature characters and performers who seem sunnily well-adjusted, a rarity in dance. Mr. Parsons's new ''Images,'' a collaboration with the photographer Howard Schatz, is a perfect example. Presented by the Parsons Dance Company on Tuesday night at the Joyce Theater, ''Images'' is a handsome celebration of youth and unblemished bodies. The piece also places dance's larger-than-life physicality and visual impact front and center.</p>
        <p>Eight dancers cross and recross the stage in striding, racing processionals, clustering in passing for the duets and larger ensemble dances that are the meat on the bones of the piece. Projected behind the performers on a 40-foot screen are towering photographs of full figures and close-ups of dancers in shifting groups.</p>

        <p>David Parsons makes dances that go down easy. They look good and they feature characters and performers who seem sunnily well-adjusted, a rarity in dance. Mr. Parsons's new ''Images,'' a collaboration with the photographer Howard Schatz, is a perfect example. Presented by the Parsons Dance Company on Tuesday night at the Joyce Theater, ''Images'' is a handsome celebration of youth and unblemished bodies. The piece also places dance's larger-than-life physicality and visual impact front and center.</p>
        <p>Eight dancers cross and recross the stage in striding, racing processionals, clustering in passing for the duets and larger ensemble dances that are the meat on the bones of the piece. Projected behind the performers on a 40-foot screen are towering photographs of full figures and close-ups of dancers in shifting groups.</p>
        <p>Mr. Parsons and Mr. Schatz have achieved an impressive balance of black-and-white images and moving bodies bathed, at times, in rosy side-lighting by Howell Binkley that underscores their aliveness. A subtle additional choreography emerges in the rhythms of the projections and of a few moments when the figures seem themselves to move, like stiff-bodied dancers.</p>
        <p>''Images'' gets cute toward the end. Mr. Parsons ties it all up by having the dancers actually pose, as if for a family portrait. And the visual impact of the piece is diluted by the shine of the piano's bright light just below the stage. But ''Images'' is otherwise an essay that suggests much about the physical impulse at the heart of dance.</p>
        <p>The dancers, all expert and spirited, were Elizabeth Koeppen, Robert Battle, Jason McDole, Ruth-Ellen Kroll, Henry Jackson, Sumayah McRae, Katarzyna Skarpetowska and George Smallwood. The score -- roiling music by Ginastera interspersed with soothing music by Satie -- was performed live by Cristina Valdes. The projection design is by Michael Clark. The black, white and dull brown-green costumes, whose simplicity helps to achieve the balance between live and photographed bodies, are by Pilar Limosner.</p>
        <p>The balance of the program, one of two to be presented during the company's two-week season at the Joyce, consisted of recent and signature works by Mr. Parsons and Mr. Battle. Three were performed to music played live by the Elm City Ensemble and the guest musician, Damien Bassman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Parsons's strobe-lighted ''Caught,'' performed by Jaime Martinez, drew its usual cheers and gasps from the audience. Six restless pajama-clad sleepers rolled, clung and tumbled in Mr. Parsons's charming ''Sleep Study'' while a seventh sleeper slept through it all, including the curtain calls. And nine dancers zanily embodied lurching shifts of emotion in Mr. Parsons's ''Mood Swing.'' Mr. Smallwood stood out in the piece for his quick, light airborne dancing.</p>
        <p>Like Mr. Parsons, Mr. Battle seems interested in the closeness of anger to love and the way that this can be expressed in dance. The most interesting aspect of Mr. Battle's two dances is their charged restraint, particularly in ''Jewel Lost.'' Danced eloquently by Ms. Koeppen, the solo ends with arms extending and rising, like the breathing-out of a long-held sigh. ''Mood Indigo,'' a suite of three duets for embattled lovers, starts off on a witty note but would benefit from editing.</p>
