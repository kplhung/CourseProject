        <p>Estimated 100,000 to 200,000 North Koreans are living illegally in China as result of their government's failure to solve its longstanding food crisis; many fear arrest and deportation to a North Korean jail; say the food aid arriving in North Korea from abroad is being sold on black market at prices that are beyond their reach; aid workers say government seems to have given up on providing food for the whole country and is forcing remote regions to fend for themselves; up to two million people have died from food shortages over last five years; deaths rates are dropping, but that is largely because of Western food aid and because North Koreans have developed survival strategies to blunt what United Nations experts have called 'slow-motion famine'; photo; map (M)</p>

        <p>Each spring, when the food runs out, the Parks leave their 11-year-old son with neighbors in North Hamgyong Province in North Korea, say they are going to the hospital, and then trudge eight hours along the railroad tracks to China in search of food and cash.</p>

        <p>Each spring, when the food runs out, the Parks leave their 11-year-old son with neighbors in North Hamgyong Province in North Korea, say they are going to the hospital, and then trudge eight hours along the railroad tracks to China in search of food and cash.</p>
        <p>It is a dangerous and emotional journey, but after three trips the Parks have a routine: Last month, they went to a border station where they knew the North Korean soldiers could be bribed, and paid 500 won, about three months' pay for a North Korean worker, so they could cross illegally into China -- and, one week later, cross back.</p>
        <p>They removed their little red pins of North Korea's founder, Kim Il Sung, when they reached the lightly patrolled Chinese side of the Tumen River, which forms the border. And they caught a bus to the home of a Chinese lay preacher of Korean descent, who had helped them before, in the nearby city of Yanji.</p>
        <p>''I came to China again because I have no other choice,'' Mr. Park, gaunt and exhausted, said just hours after his arrival. ''It's risky, but I was starving so I didn't care.''</p>
        <p>In the last month, North Korea's reclusive leader, Kim Jong Il, has made historic overtures to the outside world, visiting China for his first trip abroad in 17 years and inviting the South Korean president, Kim Dae Jung, to North Korea for a summit meeting next week. But his new international openness springs in part from continuing domestic tragedy: his government has been unable or unwilling to solve by itself Korea's longstanding food crisis.</p>
        <p>Five years into food shortages that experts say have killed up to two million people, death rates in Korea are dropping. But that is largely because of Western food aid, and because North Koreans like the Parks -- who are not further identified because of the possibility of retaliation -- have themselves developed survival strategies to blunt the lethal impact of what United Nations experts have called a ''slow-motion famine.''</p>
        <p>Some grow food in small private gardens. Some sell goods on quasi-legal gray markets. And in the northern provinces, thought to be most severely affected, many cross the border into China.</p>
        <p>The flow of people and aid over the border has become far more organized since its start three years ago. When the Parks first came in 1998, for instance, they sneaked across the Tumen River under cover of night and skulked through the woods to Yanji.</p>
        <p>Now, the aid system has become so entrenched that private relief groups working on the border get requests for food and medical help from towns, schools and even labor camps deep inside North Korea. And the channels for migration are so well established that North Koreans who live in China illegally and have enough money can send for their relatives to join them.</p>
        <p>Relief groups estimate that there are now 100,000 to 200,000 Koreans living illegally in China.</p>
        <p>''The people who have survived this far have done so because they are physiologically hearty and also because they have developed coping mechanisms,'' said a Western scholar who studies North Korea.</p>
        <p>Although North Korea will not provide numbers, interviews with Korean migrants suggest that famine deaths peaked at about 50 per 1,000 population in 1996 and 1997 and are about half that now, according to a study by researchers at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health that is soon to be published by the National Academy of Sciences.</p>
        <p>Part of the reduced toll is explained by the natural cycle of famines, researchers say. The weakest -- generally babies and the elderly -- tend to die off quickly, leaving a healthier population behind. Also, they say, people adapt by finding new, but often precarious, sources of food.</p>
        <p>''The statistics can look great, but that doesn't necessarily mean that there is more to eat,'' the Western scholar said.</p>
        <p>At a recent news conference in Geneva, David Morton, the World Food Program's representative in North Korea, noted ''a slight improvement'' in food supplies and harvests over all, but said North Korea was still very much in crisis, with certain groups and areas ''still very, very short of food.''</p>
        <p>He also suggested that the hard work of North Koreans to feed themselves was often wasted because their government had made little headway in solving basic economic and structural problems, like finding a reliable source of fuel.</p>
        <p>''We see very little result from all that effort that they put in, whether it's planting food or trees or working in the towns and the cities,'' he said.</p>
        <p>North Korea's food problems began in the early 90's with the collapse of the Soviet Union, previously its main trading partner, and accelerated after a series of floods and droughts in the mid-90's.</p>
        <p>Mr. Park, a 39-year-old miner with the haggard look of a man who has been tossed about by forces larger than himself, stares vacantly at the floor as he explains that food shortages in his village are just as dire as in 1996, when his 61-year-old mother died of hunger.</p>
        <p>Like most North Koreans illegally in China, he speaks nervously and refused to be fully identified, fearing arrest by the Chinese police and deportation to a North Korean jail.</p>
        <p>He said his family had seen none of the millions of tons of Western food aid that have poured into North Korea since 1998, which is mostly earmarked for young children.</p>
        <p>Food is available on North Korea's black markets for those with cash, he said, but he cannot afford it -- especially now, with prices at their peak,  before the year's first harvest. It has been years since he received a paycheck, he said, and the coal mine he worked in for nearly two decades closed months ago because the region had no electricity.</p>
        <p>His family has received grain from the state only twice in the last year, once in September and ''a little bit'' in January. Aid groups and North Korean migrants in China say state grain is disproportionately directed to people in the capital and to those with political connections.</p>
        <p>When he left for China, his family had been surviving on two meals a day, eating cornmeal mixed with plants foraged on the hills near their home. His 11-year-old son is small for his age and listless and gets sick easily. ''It's very hard to watch,'' he said.</p>
        <p>One study, co-sponsored by the United Nations World Food Program, found that longstanding malnutrition had left 62 percent of Korean children small for their age.</p>
        <p>The Parks estimate that members of 100 families in their town of 100,000 regularly come to this ethnic Korean prefecture in China looking for help.</p>
        <p>Aid workers say the North Korean government seems to have given up on providing food for the whole country, and is increasingly giving remote towns, villages and factories the freedom -- and the burden -- of fending for themselves.</p>
        <p>They say the shift is particularly striking in the remote northern provinces far from central food distributions points -- and close to China. The Johns Hopkins researchers found that more than half of North Koreans crossing the border said that in 1995 government-supplied grain was their family's primary source of food. Two years later, the proportion was 3.9 percent.</p>
        <p>The Chinese-Korean border, marked by the narrow Tumen River, has become the dividing line between the haves and have-nots. On the Chinese side, forested hills dotted with purple flowers give way to a paved road humming with cars, trucks and taxis; neatly planted, terraced fields and orchards are bursting with crops.</p>
        <p>Across the river, brown hills have been stripped bare by clear-cutting, fields lie fallow, and dirt paths crisscross a landscape dotted with grave markers, windowless factories and idle train stations.</p>
        <p>A few years ago, Korean migrants to China carried items like pottery, Russian liquor or chunks of North Korea's fabled Diamond Mountains to sell. But many have long since sold off everything valuable, and so rely on outright charity from relief groups or churches in this heavily Christian area of China.</p>
        <p>The Parks hope to recoup about $50 worth of Chinese currency to use on the Korean black market. They much prefer cash to food, candles or medicines -- all of which are in short supply at home -- because it is easier to hide and less liable to extortion at the border.</p>
        <p>But nearly half the migrants -- many of them women -- have no interest in going back. Instead of cash, they are looking for shelter as well as lessons in how to look and act Chinese, so they may blend in and find a new home in China. Ms. Chui, 25 -- as well as five others like her -- is living with a family of sympathetic Chinese of Korean descent who are teaching her the Bible, Chinese language, how to apply makeup and how to dress like a local.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, when she was 23, Ms. Chui decided to act to end her hunger. She got a permit from the North Korean government to visit an aunt in another city, an artifice required because internal travel is restricted. When she failed to arrive, the police briefly detained her aunt. But Ms. Chui was already over the border.</p>
        <p>Although her dream is to make her way to South Korea, it is far more likely that she will marry a Chinese man. Korean brides have become a valued -- and illegal -- commodity as China's strict family planning policies have created a shortage of marriage-age women.</p>
        <p>A few migrants will gather enough money to buy a black market Chinese residency card for themselves, for the equivalent of $1,250.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, like thousands of other long-term migrants, Ms. Chui survives by working for low wages at restaurants or factories. But wearing a crucifix, bright red lipstick, jeans and gold hoop earrings, she has already settled in.</p>
        <p>''We used to think we lived in the best country in the world, but now I can't see going back there,'' she said.</p>
