        <p>The House voted today to repeal the federal estate tax, drawing a veto threat from President Clinton even as Democrats joined Republicans in recognizing the issue's political potency.</p>
        <p>Republican leaders have made repeal of what they call the ''death tax'' one of their priorities, particularly in this election year, although the bill that cleared the House today appears far more likely to score points with crucial constituencies than to make it into law.</p>
        <p>The leaders said they were driven in part by a desire to help owners of small businesses and family farms, who have long complained that the estate tax makes it costly or even impossible to pass their holdings along to another generation.</p>
        <p>But the Republicans also said they viewed the tax as inherently unfair and even immoral, no matter who pays it.</p>
        <p>''Americans should not be taxed when they die,'' said the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Representative Bill Archer of  Texas. ''The ancient Egyptians built elaborate fortresses and tunnels and even posted guards at tombs to stop grave robbers. In today's America, we call that estate planning.''</p>
        <p>The vote was 279 to 136, with 65 Democrats voting in favor. Although that tally would have been enough to override a veto today, it would take 290 votes to override if all 435 members of the House were to vote.</p>
        <p>The legislation would phase out the federal estate and gift tax over the next 10 years, with much of the tax disappearing only at the end of the decade. The tax is levied on relatively few estates -- fewer than 48,000 this year, or about 2 percent of all deaths -- but it is of concern to people and groups with tremendous political influence, including small-business owners, farmers and wealthy people generally.</p>
        <p>Under current law, estates in the main are exempt from federal taxation up to $675,000 this year, an amount that is scheduled to rise gradually to $1 million by 2006. Family-owned businesses and farms are exempt up to $1.3 million. Above those limits, estates are subject to a graduated tax with a top rate of 55 percent.</p>
        <p>The Senate plans to take up an estate tax bill later this year, although it is not clear what form it will take. Neither party has high hopes for producing a bill this year that Mr. Clinton would be willing to sign into law, and the vote in the House today was more about allowing Republicans to score another election-year point in their antitax crusade than about finding common ground.</p>
        <p>After long opposing any substantial reductions in the estate tax as an unjustified giveaway to the rich, Democrats have grown increasingly open to addressing the issue, especially to the degree that any cuts could be tailored to benefit small-business owners and farmers.</p>
        <p>Members of both parties say the issue has also become more visible and more bipartisan as the 76-million-strong baby boom generation ages and begins thinking in earnest about estate planning. The considerable wealth generated in recent years, especially by the stock market, has been a significant factor as well.</p>
        <p>While the Democratic leadership strongly opposed the Republican bill, it sought to minimize defections from its ranks today by offering an alternative that would have effectively exempted most small businesses and farms from the tax and reduced rates even for the largest of estates. The alternative was defeated by 222 to 196.</p>
        <p>Like Mr. Clinton, the majority of Democrats in the House said the Republican bill was too sweeping and too expensive at a time when the nation must address other pressing needs, among them ensuring the solvency of Social Security and Medicare, improving the quality of public schools and providing prescription drug coverage for the elderly.</p>
        <p>Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, the senior Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, said the Republicans were being driven by their wealthy supporters to back full repeal of the tax.</p>
        <p>''You have an emotional argument in talking about repeal,'' Mr. Rangel told Republicans during debate on the floor today. ''But one day the American people will look at the cost of your bill, the cost of repeal, and wonder whether you were thinking about them or about a handful of people who have been kind to you that you are trying to get relief for.''</p>
        <p>The House bill would reduce federal tax revenue by $28 billion over the first five years, by $100 billion over the first decade and by some $50 billion a year once the phase-out was complete. Total federal revenue this year is projected to be just under $2 trillion.</p>
        <p>In a statement, Mr. Clinton said that the bill's long-term costs in lost revenue could risk the nation's fiscal health and that he would veto it  ''without hesitation.''</p>
        <p>''The House has jeopardized our fiscal discipline by passing a costly, irresponsible and regressive plan to eliminate the estate tax,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''This bill gives the largest estates a windfall while steering only a tiny fraction of the benefits to small businesses and family farms.''</p>
        <p>Critics of the estate tax say it promotes complicated and expensive tax avoidance strategies, discourages people from building wealth and allows the government to tax money that has already been taxed at least once, as personal or business income.</p>
        <p>Jonathan F. Johnson, a 37-year-old entrepreneur in Richmond, Va., has built up a chain of eight supermarkets in inner-city neighborhoods. He said he paid almost $35,000 a year in life insurance premiums just to make sure that his estate will have enough cash to pay the taxes it will owe without forcing his heirs -- he has two young daughters -- to sell all or parts of the business.</p>
        <p>''The way things are now, I'm working 100 hours a week, and I'd see more than half of those 100 hours a week go to pay estate taxes rather than to leaving something for my kids,'' Mr. Johnson said in an interview. ''It's definitely not a rich man's problem, because if it was, it wouldn't apply to me.''</p>
        <p>But many Democrats said the benefits of repealing the tax would go overwhelmingly to very few estates and the people inheriting them.</p>
        <p>According to Treasury Department figures, 22 percent of total federal estate tax revenue in 1998 -- $4.4 billion of $20.3 billion -- came from just 374 estates valued at more than $20 million each. Over half of all federal estate tax revenue in that year came from just 2,898 estates valued at $5 million or more.</p>
        <p>On the House floor today, Representative Bernard Sanders of Vermont, an independent who typically votes with the Democrats, said it was not the estate tax that was immoral, but a system in which a handful of the wealthiest and most powerful people in the country stood to get a huge tax break while the needs of the poor went unaddressed.</p>
        <p>''You say Bill Gates and his friends who contribute huge amounts of money to the political process, they need a huge tax break,'' Mr. Sanders said. ''There are people in this country who work 40 hours a week and sleep in their cars because we don't have money for affordable housing.''</p>
        <p>The bill passed today would reduce the estate tax rates in small increments, starting with a reduction in the top rate of 55 percent to 50 percent. In 2010, the tax would be repealed entirely.</p>
        <p>But given the complexity of current estate tax law -- it has supported legions of lawyers and estate planners for generations -- there are a number of wrinkles in the new legislation. Many states, for example, link their inheritance tax rates to the federal estate tax, and would have to decide whether to rewrite their laws or repeal their laws in lockstep with the federal law.</p>
        <p>There would also be changes to the way assets like stocks would be taxed. Under current law, any capital gains on assets held by the person who has died are computed as part of the value of the estate and, to the degree that the estate is subject to the federal estate tax, are taxed under estate tax rates. Should the heirs then wish to sell the stocks, they are  subject to capital gains tax only on any increase in value above that used to calculate the estate's tax liability.</p>
        <p>The same general principle would apply under the bill passed today, but only up until the point that the estate tax is repealed entirely.</p>
        <p>Starting in 2010, the capital gain would be calculated on the basis of what the person who died paid for the asset. But to keep the new bill from amounting to a big capital gains tax increase for the heirs, it includes a provision allowing transfer of $3 million in assets to a surviving spouse --  and for all but the biggest estates an additional $1.3 million in assets either to a spouse or to anyone else --  with a ''basis'' value equal to the asset's value at the time the person died.</p>
