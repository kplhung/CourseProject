        <p>The Japanese economy rebounded in the first quarter of this year, reversing the course set in the previous six months. But economists said in appraising the data released today that the numbers did not necessarily signal a sustainable recovery and merely extended the pattern of alternating growth and contraction that has prevailed for many years in Japan, Asia's biggest economy.</p>
        <p>The Economic Planning Agency said the gross domestic product, the total output of goods and services in the economy, rose 2.4 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis in the January-March quarter. That compared with a drop of 1.6 percent in the previous quarter, when Japan slipped back into a technical recession. If the economy continued to grow at the pace established in the first quarter -- which no one expects -- it would soar 10 percent in 2000.</p>
        <p>The first-quarter results pushed economic growth for the fiscal year, which ended on March 31, to a positive number for the first time in two years. The economy grew 0.5 percent in fiscal 1999, just shy of the government's 0.6 percent target.</p>
        <p>The government would have been somewhat further off its target had it not been for leap year. Without the extra day, first-quarter growth would have risen 1.9 percent, according to the agency, and in turn would have pushed the annual figure down.</p>
        <p>But with an election looming, government officials ignored such distinctions. ''What is important is not the figures but the positive growth,'' said Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori, disregarding the constant references by cabinet members and other politicians to the 0.6 percent growth target in the last year.</p>
        <p>The government has spent trillions of yen trying to invigorate the economy, underwriting housing development, small-business loans and public works projects that are coming under increased scrutiny as Japan's debts have climbed to roughly 130 percent of gross domestic product.</p>
        <p>''Even if it's only 0.5 percent, it is the first positive growth in some time, and that means the policies of the Obuchi cabinet have not been wrong,'' Taichi Sakaiya, the head of the Economic Planning Agency, said, referring to former Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, who died unexpectedly last month.</p>
        <p>But even Mr. Sakaiya, who has been among the most optimistic appraisers of the economy, hesitated to say that Japan had embarked on a self-sustaining recovery. ''In broad terms, the economy has been recovering steadily,'' he said at a news conference. ''But it has not crept out of its severe situation entirely.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mori, who replaced Mr. Obuchi in May, said the government would continue pumping money into the economy to ensure that a recovery takes root. The International Monetary Fund recently urged Japan to assemble a new supplemental budget, but politicians, like their constituents, are becoming more sensitive to Japan's debt burden. Mr. Sakaiya and Kiichi Miyazawa, the finance minister, have said the government should await the economic data on the current quarter before deciding on further spending.</p>
        <p>It was not government spending, however, that propelled the economy out of its retreat in the first quarter, much to economists' surprise. Government spending and investment was down for the third consecutive quarter, dropping 2.3 percent, in spite of a supplemental spending package of 17 trillion yen that was assembled last fall.</p>
        <p>Economists had been expecting the government to start injecting that stimulus into the economy in the first quarter and were puzzled by the decline. Hiroyuki Inoue, the senior economist at the Japan Center for Research, said separate statistics on construction starts related to public works projects had suggested that there would be growth in public investment in the first quarter.</p>
        <p>''Since the money has been allocated, it has to be spent,'' he said, ''so we should probably raise our expectations for public investment in the second quarter.''</p>
        <p>The shift of public spending into the second quarter would be politically expedient, as beneficiaries are more likely to remember it on June 25 when they vote.</p>
        <p>The unexpected fall in government pump-priming does suggest that the private sector is finally contributing more to growth. But the data on private-sector spending and investment indicates that the economy remains heavily reliant on the old engines of capital investment and strong exports that powered it in the 1970's and 1980's. Capital investment was up 4.6 percent in the first quarter, and exports grew 5.4 percent.</p>
        <p>In contrast, consumer spending, which accounts for as much as 60 percent of the gross domestic product, rose 1.8 percent, reversing an almost identical drop in the previous quarter.</p>
        <p>As a mature economy, Japan must encourage more consumer spending, but compared with even bigger increases in personal income, today's consumer spending figures did not convince many economists of a fundamental change in economic direction. ''The numbers today tell you that Japan remains a country where the economy grows when corporate expenditures rise and exports rise,'' said Jesper Koll, senior economist at Merrill Lynch in Tokyo. ''So much for the new Japan.''</p>
        <p>Corporate expenditures also seem to be more heavily skewed toward investments in the old economy rather than the new. Though spending on new information technology is clearly propelling corporate investment, construction orders were up by a hefty 20 percent in the quarter, suggesting that companies are once again spending money to expand. Retailers are building new stores in anticipation of a change in regulations next year, for example.</p>
        <p>Robert Alan Feldman, senior economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in Tokyo, cautioned, too, that such capital investments would not continue. ''The strength of this capital expenditure number is in some ways borrowing demand from the future because it will wind down,'' he said. ''The same is true of housing investment, which was spurred by government policy, so I don't think these numbers today indicate any kind of sustainable recovery.''</p>
