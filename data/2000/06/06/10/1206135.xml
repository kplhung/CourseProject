        <p>House Approves Measure To Repeal Inheritance Tax  The House voted to repeal the federal inheritance tax, drawing a veto threat from President Clinton even as Democrats joined Republicans in recognizing the issue's political potency. The vote was 279-136, with 65 Democrats voting in favor.</p>
        <p>Republican leaders, who have made repeal of what they call the ''death tax'' one of their main priorities, said they were driven in part by a desire to help owners of small businesses and family farms, who have long complained that the estate tax made it costly if not impossible to pass their holdings along to another generation. But Republicans also said they viewed the tax as inherently unfair and even immoral, no matter who pays it. [Page A1.]</p>

        <p>Nasdaq Jumps 49 Points, to 3,874  Technology stocks advanced modestly, helping the Nasdaq composite index close higher. The Nasdaq rose 49.28 points, or 1.3 percent, to 3,874.84. For the week, it climbed 61.46 points, or 1.6 percent, but is still down 4.8 percent so far this year. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 54.66 points, or 0.5 percent, to 10,614.06. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index declined 4.72 points, to 1,456.95. [C3.]</p>
        <p>Microsoft's Might Is Challenged  Whether Microsoft wins or loses its appeal of an antitrust ruling that could break the company in two, its world has changed, perhaps forever. Some of the changes are linked to a growing belief that close government scrutiny has made it more difficult for Microsoft to flex its industry might. Others are linked to the rapid emergence of new consumer markets, ranging from hand-held computing to digital delivery of audio and video, where the industry standards established by Microsoft software and Intel hardware may offer no advantage.

        <p>Prices Paid to Producers Flat in May  Prices paid to manufacturers, farmers and other producers showed no change in May as lower costs for energy and food more than offset higher prices for cars and a record jump in the cost of books, according to government figures. The flat reading in the Producer Price Index surprised analysts who had predicted that a rebound in energy costs would push up producer prices by 0.2 percent. [C3.]</p>
        <p>For Japan, Growth but Not Recovery  The Japanese economy rebounded in the first quarter of this year, reversing the course set in the previous six months. But economists said the numbers did not necessarily signal a sustainable recovery and merely extended the pattern of alternating growth and contraction that has prevailed for many years in Japan, Asia's biggest economy.

        <p>Shares of E.D.S. Tumble on Warning  Shares of Electronic Data Systems tumbled 26 percent after it said second-quarter sales would be less than analysts had expected. Shares of E.D.S. fell $14.8125, to $43. The stock has slipped 34 percent this year. Changes in the organization of its sales force are hurting revenue growth, and the warning is a setback for Richard H. Brown, who took over as chief executive last year. [C2.]</p>
        <p>Amgen Loses Round in Patent Case  Transkaryotic Therapies won a round in its patent fight with the biotechnology giant Amgen when a judge ruled that Transkaryotic did not infringe on one of Amgen's patents covering its best-selling drug. A trial continues on other Amgen patents. [C2.]</p>
        <p>Unemployment Rate in Canada Falls  Canada's unemployment rate dipped to a 24-year low of 6.6 percent in May, down two-tenths of a percentage point from April. The strong economy added more than 42,000 jobs last month and almost all were full-time jobs in the private sector. Given the strong job market and other signs of a brisk economy, economists expect the Bank of Canada to continue to match any interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve in the United States.
