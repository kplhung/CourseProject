        <p>With Iraqi profits from oil sales now at record-high levels, the Security Council has extended the ''oil-for-food'' program for another six months to allow the imports of food, medicine and other civilian necessities.</p>
        <p>During this period, a new arms inspection system will be readied to go into action in Iraq, the chief inspector said on Thursday, challenging Iraq to take advantage of a more lenient set of requirements for suspending economic sanctions imposed after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.</p>
        <p>The oil-for-food plan was instituted by the United Nations in 1996 to help alleviate the sufferings of ordinary Iraqis under the sanctions, and must be renewed every six months. Late last year, the United Nations lifted the ceiling on how much oil Iraq could sell.</p>
        <p>In debate before a vote near midnight on Thursday, the deadline for the oil-sales extension, the council defeated a Russian and Chinese attempt to write into the resolution language that would have identified the sanctions as the sole cause of continuing hardships in Iraq.</p>
        <p>That argument did not convince all council members, as the Iraqis are thought to have generated $8.4 billion in oil sales in the latest six-month phase. Since 1996, $25.3 billion in oil has been sold. Some experts say that President Saddam Hussein is also pulling in hundreds of millions of dollars in illegally smuggled oil.</p>
        <p>Not all the legal profits go to the government for purchases to improve the lives of Iraqi citizens. A third of the income is set aside for a compensation fund for victims of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, and other sums are earmarked for autonomous Kurdish areas of Iraq and for the arms inspection budget. Even so, Secretary General Kofi Annan said in his latest report to the Security Council this week, there is now enough money to significantly mitigate civilians' hardships if the government managed it better.</p>
        <p>''Now that increased revenues are available for the implementation of the program, the government of Iraq is in a position to reduce current malnutrition levels and to improve the health status of the Iraqi people,'' Mr. Annan said. He urged Iraq to increase the oil revenue allocated to health and nutrition, to order and distribute supplies more efficiently.</p>
        <p>Mr. Annan also said in his report that the most recent surveys by Unicef, the United Nations children's fund, found that malnutrition rates had leveled, with a slight reduction in the number of underweight children, although rates for severe conditions known as stunting and wasting were still too high. As for other aspects of children's welfare, Mr. Annan's report noted some advances in education, including the rehabilitation of schools.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Annan again warned that the practice of certain Security Council members -- primarily the United States, though it was not named -- of blocking contracts with Iraq for water and sanitation equipment will continue to harm health.</p>
        <p>The Security Council also decided in the resolution approved Thursday night to send an independent assessment team to Iraq to study the condition of the Iraqi people.</p>
        <p>The sanctions were to have remained in place until Iraq was certified as free of prohibited weapons -- chemical, biological and nuclear arms as well as long-range missiles. But last December, the Security Council proposed suspending sanctions if Iraq cooperated with a new team of arms inspectors.</p>
        <p>In an interview Thursday, Hans Blix, the executive chairman of the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission, or Unmovic, said that the new organization has now filled most senior-level jobs and will be training inspectors over the next few months. By August, they will be ready to reopen the Baghdad monitoring center, closed by Iraq since December 1998, and prepare for resumed inspections. The International Atomic Energy Agency, which Dr. Blix once directed and which is responsible for monitoring nuclear programs, is ready to resume its inspections at any time.</p>
        <p>Although most of Iraq's complaints about the earlier inspection commission, Unscom, have been addressed in the new system, Mr. Hussein has shown no inclination to let inspectors return.</p>
        <p>Dr. Blix said that after an absence of 18 months, inspectors will have to re-establish baselines for  surveys, reviewing all suspect Iraqi sites to be monitored. Confounding his critics, Dr. Blix, a former Swedish foreign minister, has kept some  essential experts from Unscom on his team, ignoring Iraqi and Russian demands for a clean slate.</p>
        <p>''Then comes the question, when are we going in?'' he said. ''We see no sign whatever of that at the present time. However, in politics things can change, and my personal view is that the Iraqis would gain by cooperating and accepting.''</p>
        <p>''They demand that the so-called sanctions should be lifted,'' he said. But he added that few stringent sanctions remained, beyond a ban on air travel in and out of the country. ''It was an embargo on the sale of oil first; now there are no limits on how much oil they can sell,'' he said. ''They can use any amount they want to buy food and medicine -- but they cannot buy weapons.</p>
        <p>''This is the Iraqi position: that they want to have all these restrictions lifted.</p>
        <p>He said the Security Council resolution creating the new inspection commission offered some innovations that Iraq should consider if it wants to speed the end of sanctions.</p>
        <p>''It enables the Security Council to suspend the sanctions provided two criteria: that there be cooperation with Unmovic in 120 days, and included in the cooperation will also be the resolution of some key disarmament issues,'' he said. ''The criteria are, I would say, more lenient.''</p>
