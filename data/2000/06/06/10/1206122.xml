        <p>If this bionic economy has a soft underbelly, it may be trade.</p>
        <p>As Americans gorge on imported cars, electronics, clothing and a long list of other goods from abroad, the nation's trade deficit has swollen to record proportions, leaving economists and policy makers increasingly troubled.</p>
        <p>The trade deficit for March, the most recent month for which data is available, was $30.2 billion, 56 percent higher than in March 1999. Imports for March totaled $117.4 billion, up 21.9 percent from the corresponding month a year earlier.</p>
        <p>Broader measures of the nation's international transactions have also deteriorated. The current account deficit -- which includes foreigners' profits on investments in the United States and Americans' investments in other countries as well as trade in goods and services -- reached $338.9 billion in 1999, up 53.6 percent from 1998.</p>
        <p>The current account deficit, which amounted to 3.7 percent of total economic output for all of last year and 4.2 percent in the fourth quarter, is projected by most economists to rise again this year. It is already by far the largest among the big industrialized countries. The last time trade was a big issue for the American economy, during the mid-and late-1980's, the current account deficit peaked at 3.4 percent of gross domestic product.</p>
        <p>The main reason for the surge is clear. For the last few years, the American economy has been booming, while those of its major trading partners have been weak. As a result, the thirst for imported goods has grown even as the market for American exports has stagnated.</p>
        <p>What is less clear is whether the trade imbalance will prove to be a substantial problem.</p>
        <p>It could recede quickly if Japan bounces back and Europe's recovery continues, especially if the Federal Reserve also succeeds in slowing the growth of economic demand in the United States. And in any case, foreign companies and investors have been happy so far to finance the deficit by recycling the dollars they earn through trade back into the United States, where the technology-fueled boom has offered high rates of return. Indeed, some economists see the current account deficit more as an indicator of a healthy surge of foreign investment into the United States than as a sign of a sickening trade imbalance.</p>
        <p>But there is a worst-case set of possibilities out there that haunts many economists: foreign investors lose faith in the American economy's relative advantages, investment from abroad dries up, the dollar plunges, inflation jumps and the Fed is forced to respond by driving interest rates sharply higher, endangering the long expansion.</p>
        <p>With the American economy strong and unemployment low, the growing trade deficit so far has not produced the same protectionist pressures that previous surges in the trade gap have provoked. Yes, anxiety about competition from low- wage workers abroad was at the heart of labor's failed campaign against normalizing trade relations with China. But the trade gap itself has merited hardly a mention so far in the presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>And in contrast to the 1980's, when the United States was plagued by a simultaneous rise in its trade and budget deficits, the federal government is currently running a large budget surplus, providing a substantial cushion for the economy.</p>
        <p>Still, the situation has policy makers in Washington concerned. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has repeatedly warned that the rapid growth in imports compared with a much more modest increase in exports cannot go on forever. And it has been on the mind of Lawrence H. Summers, the Treasury secretary.</p>
        <p>''When a large external imbalance reflects a period of strong growth relative to the rest of the world, and relatively high investment in our productive potential, as it does in the United States today,'' Mr. Summers said in a speech last month, ''that imbalance is unlikely to pose an immediate threat to our economic well-being.''</p>
        <p>But, Mr. Summers added, ''a large and growing current account deficit is not something that can be sustained indefinitely.''</p>
        <p>''It can also give rise to protectionist pressures,'' he said, ''and it distorts the pattern of domestic economic activity.''</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration has shown no inclination to push down the dollar to promote exports by making American goods cheaper when purchased in foreign currencies. Indeed, calls for a weaker dollar from exporters and industries that compete with imports have been relatively muted compared with the 1980's, when auto companies, steel makers, farmers and other howled about their inability to compete with their foreign counterparts.</p>
        <p>Instead, the administration has stressed the importance of increasing national savings by paying down the federal debt -- a step that could help reduce reliance on foreign capital -- and has pressed Japan and Europe to overhaul their economies to create more demand for goods from the United States.</p>
        <p>''We'd see a more balanced situation if Europe and Japan were growing faster,'' said Ralph C. Bryant, an economist at the Brookings Institution, the research organization. ''But you wouldn't want to put the brakes hard on the U.S. economy just to get the trade and current account deficits smaller, and you don't want to put up new fences at the border. That would be far more costly than would make sense.''</p>
        <p>But as the current account deficit has grown, there has been an increasing debate inside and outside of government about the degree of the threat posed by the trade gap.</p>
        <p>One camp views the deficit as essentially benign.</p>
        <p>In this view, the trade gap will narrow as the American economy slows. In any case, imports so far in this economic cycle have served as a safety valve for the supercharged American economy, helping to keep inflation under control at a time when domestic producers cannot keep up with demand.</p>
        <p>Moreover, by purchasing so much from abroad, the United States has helped many other countries rebound from the financial crisis that swept around the world in 1998. And by investing the dollars they earn back into the United States, foreign companies, governments and investors are adding to the pool of capital that American companies have used to become more productive and competitive.</p>
        <p>''With the current account deficit at a record high, it's silly to say it can't possibly be of any importance,'' said John Lipsky, chief economist at the Chase Manhattan Corporation. ''But the current account deficit is only a sign of other developments of more direct importance, in this case the significant and sustained growth differential between the U.S. and its trading partners.''</p>
        <p>At the same time, Mr. Lipsky added, ''The emergence of what is sometimes called the new economy has attracted foreign investors.''</p>
        <p>In the sense that the current account deficit is just the reverse side of a flood of foreign direct investment in the United States, ''it represents something good about the U.S., not something bad,'' Mr. Lipsky said.</p>
        <p>But there is a more dire view of the trade imbalance.</p>
        <p>In this view, further expansion in the current account deficit cannot be sustained. The deficit is at a level that leaves the economy vulnerable to a sharp fall in the value of the dollar, a jump in inflation and interest rates, and a slowdown in growth or even a recession.</p>
        <p>''You cannot continually run a growing current account deficit without ultimately facing a very sharp fall in your exchange rate, which in the current circumstances of the U.S. economy could be a killer,'' said C. Fred Bergsten, the director of the Institute for International Economics in Washington.</p>
        <p>The chain of events that Mr. Bergsten worries about would involve a steep drop in the dollar, a resulting surge in inflation and a determined response by the Federal Reserve to restore stability by pushing interest rates up sharply.</p>
        <p>The current account gap, Mr. Bergsten said, is ''the single biggest threat to the current expansion of the economy.''</p>
        <p>Among policy makers in Washington, there is less a sense of crisis than a gnawing concern about the long-term trends in trade. Officials at the Fed cite a theory first developed in the 1960's by Hendrik S. Houthakker, an economist at Harvard University. He found that growth in imports to the United States relative to income growth runs at roughly twice the rate it does in the rest of the world. That finding has been confirmed repeatedly over the years.</p>
        <p>In other words, if the American economy is expanding at anything close to the rest of the world's growth rate, the American trade deficit will increase.</p>
        <p>That was not a big problem during a lot of the post-World War II period, when much of the rest of the world experienced higher growth rates than the United States. But should growth in the United States remain as strong as it has been the last few years, and should the rest of the world not rebound, it could push the trade deficit to previously unimagined levels.</p>
        <p>In political terms, there is also the possibility of the trade deficit with a particular country or set of countries creating protectionist pressures in Washington. Organized labor is likely to keep a close eye on trade with China, which is about to join the  World Trade Organization. And any renewed effort by Japan to export its way out of its doldrums could bring a return of the trade tensions that characterized its relationship with the United States for years.</p>
        <p>But among consumers, who have enjoyed lower prices and improved quality in many products as a result of global competition, there are few signs of worry.</p>
        <p>''If Americans are going to want me to buy their car, then they need to offer me a good product,'' said Diane Spivey of Clermont, Ga., who recently bought a Volkswagen Passat. ''I don't look on it as your economy and my economy. The world is a pretty small place these days.''</p>
