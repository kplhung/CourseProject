        <p>ABC's marathon broadcast of Dallas's 1-0 three-overtime victory over the Devils in Game 5 of the Stanley Cup finals on Thursday night offered a compelling reason for hockey being better in extra sessions than basketball: with no action-ending timeouts, there are no endless commercial breaks.</p>
        <p>If all games were white-knuckle, multi-overtime events, perhaps ratings would be more respectable for prime time. Thus, Game 5 -- scoreless until Mike Modano's goal, yet impossible to avert one's eyes from -- produced a 4.2 Nielsen rating, the best of ABC's three games. That is 20 percent better than last year's Game 5, which was on Fox.</p>

        <p>ABC's marathon broadcast of Dallas's 1-0 three-overtime victory over the Devils in Game 5 of the Stanley Cup finals on Thursday night offered a compelling reason for hockey being better in extra sessions than basketball: with no action-ending timeouts, there are no endless commercial breaks.</p>
        <p>If all games were white-knuckle, multi-overtime events, perhaps ratings would be more respectable for prime time. Thus, Game 5 -- scoreless until Mike Modano's goal, yet impossible to avert one's eyes from -- produced a 4.2 Nielsen rating, the best of ABC's three games. That is 20 percent better than last year's Game 5, which was on Fox.</p>
        <p>The rating rose from a 3.6 from 8 to 11 p.m. to a 5.0 from 11 until 1:18 a.m. The peak rating of a 5.7 was reached from 11:30 to midnight.</p>
        <p>This was great hockey made better without timeouts as strategic crutches.</p>
        <p>Regulation hockey is commercial-thin. Only three TV timeouts are permitted per period, for 90 seconds each, which forces ABC and other telecasters to load spots into the intermissions. So despite the savvy of ABC's Al Michaels, John Davidson, John Saunders and Barry Melrose, they lacked the time to say much between periods. During the second intermission, ABC carried 4 minutes 47 seconds of editorial content and 11:35 in ads.</p>
        <p>ABC capably tracked the ice time of key players, hits, scoring chances and shots on goal, which begot a running discussion about the many misses of the Devils' Bobby Holik.</p>
        <p>ABC surrounded the ice with hockey mavens (though not the Maven, Stan Fischler) like Brian Engblom and Darren Pang, who offered game-advancing insights and vignettes and did not display the sycophancy of Ahmad Rashad, NBC's designated player pal. ABC didn't prowl the stands looking for B-list celebrities; it opted for an emotional focus on Melanie Brodeur as she agonizingly watched her husband, Martin, the Devils' goalie.</p>
        <p>ABC was less strong in its camera work, taking too many risks with a surfeit of low-angle shots that sacrificed the broader middle-ice view. That adventurism was only sometimes rewarded with close-ups of bone-jangling checks. In two instances, including the opening face-off, ABC used a low angle that was screened off from the face-off; it missed three other face-offs, twice while lingering on close-ups.</p>
        <p>The announcers Gary Thorne and Bill Clement described the game capably. Thorne's voice conveys excitement. But analysis carries risk. To start the third period, Thorne asked Clement which team benefited  from a 0-0 game. ''Dallas has trouble sustaining and the Devils have a killer instinct,'' Clement said. ''Dallas has a problem.'' The analysis was right, but as a prediction, it was wrong.</p>
        <p>Thorne later made a telling comment in the first overtime: ''Coaches plan their rotations around timeouts. But in the overtime, that's gone.''</p>
