        <p>The best performance ever by a junior team occurred this week at the International Team Trials in Memphis, where a group of world-class players were fighting for the right to represent the United States in the world championships in Maastricht, the Netherlands, in August.</p>
        <p>The unexpected heroes were John Hurd of Charleston, S.C., and Kent Mignocchi of the Bronx, both 21, Joel Wooldridge of Buffalo, 20, Joe Grue of Minneapolis, 18, and John Kranyak of Bay Village, Ohio, 16. To the astonishment of the cognoscenti, they headed the two qualifying stages, in the process eliminating bunches of established stars.</p>
        <p>In the quarterfinal, ending Thursday night, they played an even match against a top team that came within a hair of winning the Vanderbilt Knockout in Cincinnati in March: Richard Schwartz, Drew Casen, Zia Mahmood, Michael Rosenberg, Bobby Levin and Steve Weinstein. With 15 deals remaining of a scheduled 120, Schwartz led by just 4 imps, but held on to win by 16.</p>
        <p>It was the first time a junior team had mounted a serious challenge on an occasion of such importance, and all five players can be expected to win major titles in the future.</p>
        <p>In other quarterfinals, results by captain were: George Jacobs beat Jimmy Cayne by 12; Rose Johnson-Meltzer beat George Steiner by 110. In semifinals Friday and Saturday, Schwartz plays Johnson-Meltzer and Jacobs faces Nick Nickell, who was exempt from earlier rounds.</p>
        <p>An apparent loss for the junior team in the second stage of the qualifying play proved to be a triumph. On the diagramed deal, East opened one club, strong and artificial. Mignocchi, South, ventured a weak jump overcall of two spades, trading on the favorable vulnerability.</p>
        <p>West's double showed at least six high-card points, and was not for penalties. Grue, North, raised to three spades, and East doubled for takeout. West passed for penalties, and South had to do the best he could.</p>
        <p>The diamond queen was led, and won the first trick. A trump shift rode to South's nine. The heart nine was led and ducked to East's ten, a dubious plan by declarer. The diamond jack and ace were cashed, West discarding his other hearts. The defense scored a heart ruff and West led a trump to dummy's eight.</p>
        <p>A club from dummy was won by East, who played the diamond king, ruffed and overruffed. The club ace was led, forcing dummy to ruff with the spade ace. South threw his last club on the heart ace, but West ruffed. That was down four, for a penalty of 800.</p>
        <p>East-West had done well in defense, but they had lost the deal in the bidding. In the replay, Wooldridge and Kranyak were East-West, and against silent opponents bid efficiently to the unbeatable contract of six clubs. Their auction was:</p>

        <p>By making the slam, the junior team gained 11 imps en route to their victory in the qualifying stage.</p>
