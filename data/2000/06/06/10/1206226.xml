        <p>LAWRENCE - Jacob. The Trustees, the Director and the staff of The Studio Museum in Harlem are deeply saddened by the passing of our friend, Jacob Lawrence. From his beginnings as a young artist during the Harlem renaissance his work chronicled, with beauty and grace the African American experience. He was a founding member of the museum's Curatorial Council and his work is a cornerstone of this collection. We were proud to have known him. We extend our sincere condolences to his wife, Gwendolyn Knight Lawrence. He will always be remembered, in Harlem and around the world. George L. Knox, Chairman Lowery Stokes Sims, Director</p>
