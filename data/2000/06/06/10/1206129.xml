        <p>A surprise victory for campaign reform in the Senate on Thursday was sidetracked yesterday in the House, where Republican leaders went through some bizarre contortions of logic to thwart the bill. The measure would require disclosure of donors to political slush funds operating under Section 527 of the federal tax code. These tax-exempt funds, created in some cases by members of Congress, have begun raising money from secret sources and running ads promoting or criticizing candidates.</p>
        <p>Despite the defeat yesterday, there is still a chance to strip away the secrecy of these funds. One reason the bill lost was that Republicans who have favored campaign reform were promised an opportunity to vote on an alternative bill in two weeks. The problem is that the alternative may create more problems than it solves. It would force disclosure of donors who give not only to political groups but to many other groups involved in public issues, whether or not their work is related to elections.</p>

        <p>A surprise victory for campaign reform in the Senate on Thursday was sidetracked yesterday in the House, where Republican leaders went through some bizarre contortions of logic to thwart the bill.

        <p>Despite the defeat yesterday, there is still a chance to strip away the secrecy of these funds. One reason the bill lost was that Republicans who have favored campaign reform were promised an opportunity to vote on an alternative bill in two weeks. The problem is that the alternative may create more problems than it solves. It would force disclosure of donors who give not only to political groups but to many other groups involved in public issues, whether or not their work is related to elections.</p>
        <p>Proponents of reform have to be careful not to be so intrusive as to require all charitable or policy-based groups to disclose their financial supporters. However, the alternative bill, offered by Representative Michael Castle, a Delaware Republican, may be disingenuous. Opponents of reform know that an overly broad disclosure requirement might scare off lawmakers concerned about violating rights protected by the Constitution.</p>
        <p>There will be time in the next two weeks to make sure that the House is forced to vote on eliminating abuses that have emerged this year. There has been a proliferation of Section 527 groups hiding their sources of money and carrying out attack ads on television like those used against Senator John McCain during the primary season. Curbing Section 527 groups is an urgent priority. Congress should then outlaw all unregulated soft money going to political parties for use in promoting or attacking candidates.</p>
