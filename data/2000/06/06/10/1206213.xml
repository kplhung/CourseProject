        <p>Will Catherine Ndereba of Kenya, winner of the 2000 Boston marathon, redeem her second-place finish in last year's New York City Marathon?

        <p>The elite international field that will compete in the New York Mini Marathon today has brought an element of drama: the 10-kilometer race could portend things to come in the Sydney Summer Olympics in September.</p>
        <p>Will Catherine Ndereba of Kenya, winner of the 2000 Boston marathon, redeem her second-place finish in last year's New York City Marathon? Will Adriana Fernandez of Mexico, who won the New York race, win here? Will the Kenyans -- Ndereba, Tegla Loroupe, who has won the event five times, and Hellen Kimaiyo-Kiposkei -- have something to prove against Ethiopia's Fatuma Roba and Derartu Tulu?</p>
        <p>Another question is whether Anne-Marie Lauck, the local favorite, will be able to shake off her third-place finish in February's Olympic trials, which cost her a spot on the American team and regain her stride in time for the Olympic 10-kilometer trials in Sacramento next month.</p>
        <p>The answers may start to unfold over a 6.2-mile stretch in Central Park. But the runners played down suggestions that the race was a prelude to the women's Olympic marathon and 10,000 meters.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to be thinking about the 10K,'' Roba said through a translator when asked during a press conference last Thursday whether she would be thinking about Sydney when she lines up next to Fernandez and Loroupe today.</p>
        <p>Ndereba said she would not be thinking of the past or the future, but of improving her personal best of 31.34 by at least five seconds.</p>
        <p>''I face the race as a competition, not that Adriana defeated me and that I have to defeat her,'' said Ndereba, who attributed her ninth-place finish in last year's race to a twisted left ankle.</p>
        <p>Ndereba cannot afford to dwell on the past. If she were to make her country's Olympic team, it would be in the 10,000 meters. Although Ndereba became the first woman from Kenya to win the Boston Marathon, in 2 hours 26 minutes 11 seconds, she was not chosen for the women's national team and is using New York as a tuneup for the Olympic trials, July 19 to 22, in Kenya.</p>
        <p>Lauck, who lives and trains in Hampton, N.J., won the Mini Marathon in 1994 in 31:52. Last year she set a fast pace but finished 12th.</p>
        <p>''I did the right thing,'' Lauck said of the strategy she used a year ago. ''I go by experience and what I think my body can do. I don't know what my body will give, but I'm really pleased with my track times and my priority are my workouts.''</p>
        <p>The field also includes Yuko Arimori of Japan, who won a silver medal in the marathon in the 1992 Barcelona Games, Yelena Viasova of Ukraine, the 1988 Olympic 10,000-meter bronze medalist, and Restituta Joseph of Tanzania. Among those running for fun are Emily Loroupe, 21, the younger sister of Tegla. Loroupe attends the University of Toledo on an athletic scholarship.</p>
        <p>The Mini Marathon, a road race only for women, began in 1972 with a field of 75. This year, an estimated 4,000 women are expected to compete in the event. Grete Waitz holds the record of 31:00, set in 1980.</p>
