        <p>A teenage boy opened fire with a handgun last night in the basketball court of a South Bronx housing development, critically wounding a 12-year-old boy and a 22-year-old man and sending dozens of police officers in bulletproof vests and helicopters on a manhunt, police officials said.</p>
        <p>The shooting took place about 9 p.m. in the middle of the Melrose Houses, a low-income development at East 155th Street and Courtlandt Avenue, while several people were playing basketball, the police and witnesses said. The police said they were unsure whether the victims were the attacker's intended targets.</p>
        <p>The younger victim was Edwin Sanderson, according to a boy who was playing basketball with him. Edwin had been shot in the chin, the police said. The second victim, Peter Brooks, had been shot in the back, the police said.</p>
        <p>The victims were listed in stable but critical condition at Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center in the South Bronx late last night.</p>
        <p>The assailant, who was being sought early this morning, was described as a 5-foot, 10-inch tall black male, wearing dark jeans and a Fubu shirt with the number 5 emblazoned on it.</p>
        <p>''I was playing ball with Edwin and his brother Andrew when I heard pop! pop! pop! pop! and I ran,'' said Dequan, who lives next door to Edwin in one of the apartment towers. Dequan said Edwin was struck while trying to flee.</p>
        <p>''I was hysterical,'' said Gloria Dixon, 35, Dequan's mother, who said she would take steps to keep her children safe.</p>
        <p>''From now, they're going to be inside with me or in front of the building.''</p>
        <p>Several residents said the area had been plagued by shootings, but Ms. Dixon said she had thought the situation was improving.</p>
