        <p>As one day turned into another, homemade tinfoil Stanley Cups were being hoisted around the arena, a laser image of the cup was dancing on the ice and the real Stanley Cup was ready to be escorted out to the rink.</p>
        <p>On this night of expectation, the season was one flick of the wrist from being over, but the Dallas Stars remembered their identity.</p>
        <p>''We're still the champions,'' said Guy Carbonneau, who speaks with the innate entitlement of a former Montreal Canadien, when that team was great.</p>
        <p>Nowadays, hockey champions are where you find them, in all kinds of goofy places, like Dallas, or maybe in New Jersey, far from the vital northern headwaters of the sport.</p>
        <p>Still, the new locales have their dreams of becoming hockey dynasties, the way Montreal used to be one. The Devils, playing in a most dismal complex in a swamp alongside an interstate, far from any sign of urban transport or cuisine, will have to postpone any potential parking lot parade.</p>
        <p>Early yesterday morning, the Stars concluded the fourth-longest game in Stanley Cup finals history, 46 minutes 21 seconds of overtime following the regulation hour, when Mike Modano deflected a shot by Brett Hull for a 1-0 victory.</p>
        <p>Even though there was no score for more than five periods, the game was exciting, totally demolishing the patronizing theory that American sports fans must have their home run derbies and their dunkathons for the same reason they engorge sugar and salt in their fast-food diets.</p>
        <p>There were sensational stops by both goalies, Ed Belfour of Dallas and Martin Brodeur of New Jersey, as well as heartstopping failed chances for both teams. Players on both sides curbed their regular-season proclivities toward stickwork and elbow work, not wanting to draw the penalty that could cost them a Stanley Cup.</p>
        <p>The game was so good and so long that it sapped even the rowdy excesses of the fans, who ape the combativeness of the players. Fans who were leaping to their feet on every fast break in regulation time increasingly remained seated as the overtimes just kept coming and the beer went to their knees. Yet the players found the inner resources to keep skating, keep shooting, keep hitting, keep bouncing back.</p>
        <p>''Somebody said, 'See you in an hour,' '' Carbonneau recalled.</p>
        <p>The Stars had to shuck off the boisterous crowd, the Devils' home-ice edge of making the final line change, and the sense of inevitability. The champs had come to New Jersey on Thursday evening, trailing by three games to one, with every excuse to get blown away on the road, but they remembered who they were.</p>
        <p>Last year they won the cup on the road in a sixth game when Hull scored the second-latest goal in the history of the Stanley Cup finals, at 54:51 of overtime. People in Buffalo still feel Hull was illegitimately situated in the crease, and they still resent how the National Hockey League hustled out the Stanley Cup and staged a celebration while the Sabres cried foul. But the Stars never looked back.</p>
        <p>''We found a way to finish last year,'' said Carbonneau, who helped win two Stanley Cups in Montreal and one last year. ''Now they have to try to do it.''</p>
        <p>The Stars wanted to believe they were too ornery to die, at least right then and there. Where both teams found their psychic strength is one of those mysteries that make sport so appealing, beyond the ludicrous latter-day salaries and the MTV-style posturing by celebrity jocks.</p>
        <p>Sport is still about surprise and comebacks, whether temporary or permanent -- like the Mets scaring the Atlanta Braves last October, the Lakers' comeback against Portland last Sunday, the St. Louis Rams finding a way to win in the closing minutes of a truly superior Super Bowl.</p>
        <p>This does not mean the Stars are better competitors or people than the Devils are. Hardly. This was merely a one-night resolve of champions as they sat in a quiet locker room and sought another 20 minutes' worth of strength, hunkering down for as long as it took.</p>
        <p>Afterward the Stars' locker room gave mute evidence of the minimalist existence between periods. There were a few orange slices on the soggy floor, a crumpled wrapper of a  supposedly nutritional health bar, a few stale bagels and muffins and chocolate chip cookies on the counter, a pot of coffee, labeled decaffeinated, although one could debate the value of ''useless dark brown water,'' as David Letterman rightly labels it.</p>
        <p>And there were jugs of water and jugs of Powerade -- ''just getting fluids into us,'' Kirk Muller, the former Devil, said.</p>
        <p>The Stars agreed there were no inspirational speeches: ''Too much experience in this room,'' said Richard Matvichuk, who helped win the cup last year.</p>
        <p>Muller remembered somebody saying: ''It isn't often a pretty goal that wins in overtime. Let's keep plugging.'' And some players said they were too tired to talk.</p>
        <p>''We're fighting for our lives,'' said Darryl Sydor, who helped win a cup last year. ''I just sat there between periods.''</p>
        <p>Properly pragmatic, the Stars noted that they were still a game down and that the Devils were an excellent road team. But there was something else: ''They looked stunned at the end,'' Carbonneau said.</p>
        <p>At the end, the tinfoil cups went home, the laser show was turned off, and the real Stanley Cup was locked in its sturdy carrying case, ready for another road trip, just like the two teams of warriors, one of them a defending champion with memories.</p>
