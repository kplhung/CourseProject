        <p>One essential element is missing from your June 3 editorial ''Measuring the Progress of Women'': the need for accurate statistics. We cannot understand how women's lives are changing without reliable data on women's education, work, health, human rights and economic status.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>One essential element is missing from your June 3 editorial ''Measuring the Progress of Women'': the need for accurate statistics. We cannot understand how women's lives are changing without reliable data on women's education, work, health, human rights and economic status.</p>
        <p>A recent United Nations report brings together the latest statistics from national and international sources. But data on maternal mortality are unavailable or unreliable because of deficiencies in many countries' vital statistics registration systems.</p>
        <p>All countries must improve the capacity of their national statistics to regularly collect basic data on women and men. Only then will we be able to say we can take the true measure of women's progress.</p>
        <p>NITIN DESAI  New York, June 6, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is United Nations under secretary general for economic and social affairs.</p>
