        <p>Though most Americans may think they have never heard music by the French composer Marius Constant, they have. Mr. Constant composed one of the most famous musical tidbits ever written: the 30-second theme music for the television show ''The Twilight Zone.''</p>
        <p>Of course, in the context of Mr. Constant's distinguished career, composing this theme music was a fluke. Born in Bucharest in 1925, Mr. Constant moved to Paris before he was 20 and studied with Messiaen and Boulanger. He worked closely with Maurice Bejart, Roland Petit and other noted choreographers. In 1958 Leonard Bernstein performed Mr. Constant's ''24 Preludes Pour Orchestre'' with the New York Philharmonic.</p>

        <p>Though most Americans may think they have never heard music by the French composer Marius Constant, they have. Mr. Constant composed one of the most famous musical tidbits ever written: the 30-second theme music for the television show ''The Twilight Zone.''</p>
        <p>Of course, in the context of Mr. Constant's distinguished career, composing this theme music was a fluke. Born in Bucharest in 1925, Mr. Constant moved to Paris before he was 20 and studied with Messiaen and Boulanger. He worked closely with Maurice Bejart, Roland Petit and other noted choreographers. In 1958 Leonard Bernstein performed Mr. Constant's ''24 Preludes Pour Orchestre'' with the New York Philharmonic.</p>
        <p>Since then his music has been little heard in this country. The Riverside Symphony, which has won deserved attention for its adventurous programming of new and neglected works, corrected that oversight by presenting the United States premiere of Mr. Constant's ''103 Regards dans l'Eau'' on Thursday night at Alice Tully Hall in a ''Musical Salute to France.'' And the grateful 75-year-old composer was in attendance.</p>
        <p>The work, composed in 1981, is an unusual kind of violin concerto, a series, as its title suggests, of 103 short musical glances or reflections on water. Mr. Constant's complex musical language draws from a wide range of styles: Impressionism, wayward atonality, bolts of 12-tone writing, ecstatic harmonic explorations that recall Messiaen. But he fashions the styles into an original musical voice. Mr. Constant has an acute sensitivity to instrumental sonorities: the work begins with sustained, soft high tones traded between the violin and a solo clarinet, then picked up by other winds and strings, to create an unearthly effect as fresh as anything produced electronically.</p>
        <p>On first hearing, the work's structure seems its weakness. The idea of a 30-minute concerto comprised of 103 strung-together snippets is fascinating. But as if afraid to carry it out, Mr. Constant fashions the snippets into four large movements. The result is a standard concerto form that sounds oddly fragmented. Still, the music is substantive and intriguing. The French violinist Olivier Charlier played the fitful solo part brilliantly. And under the conductor George Rothman the noticeably young and eager Riverside players performed with involvement and skill.</p>
        <p>To frame this work Mr. Rothman offered the New York premiere of Debussy's ruminative and fetching ballet score, ''Khamma,'' written in 1912 for the Canadian dancer Maud Allan. The program ended with another New York premiere: Ravel's great Piano Trio in a transcription for orchestra by the conductor Yan Pascal Tortelier. This is not a gimmick, but Mr. Tortelier's attempt to make audible additional details and richness from this familiar work.</p>
        <p>If not preferable to the original, the orchestral transcription is certainly fascinating. A degree of musical incisiveness is lost when, say, a soft line in the piano's lowest register is executed by a lumbering contrabassoon, or by four gravelly string bases. But the rambling last movement, perhaps the trio's least strong, sounded great in this brassy, splashy and tumultuous orchestral version. The score is difficult, and the performance was not always solid. But it and this entire program were a treat to hear.</p>
