        <p>The House today rejected a measure to require a growing number of secretive political groups that raise and spend unlimited sums on political activities to reveal their donors and spending.</p>
        <p>The decisive vote, 216 to 202, came on a procedural motion and was largely along party lines, with most Democrats supporting it and most Republicans opposing. On May 25, the House defeated a similar measure, 214 to 208.</p>
        <p>But House Republican leaders so feared that the latest proposal offered by Representative Lloyd Doggett, Democrat of Texas, might pass that this morning they promised several moderate Republicans a floor vote by month's end on a broader campaign advertising disclosure bill in exchange for opposing today's measure.</p>
        <p>Representative Michael N. Castle, a Delaware Republican who is sponsoring the broader legislation, said as many as eight more Republicans might have voted for the Democratic measure except for the pledge from Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois and Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader. Those votes would have been enough to propel the measure to victory.</p>
        <p>Even in defeat, today's vote coupled with the Senate's unexpected approval on Thursday of a similar measure sponsored by Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, appeared to open a new front in the battle to tighten the nation's campaign finance law in mid-election cycle.</p>
        <p>''There's no doubt that the announcement of the vote by the majority leader and the filing of this bill are a direct result of growing support for this issue,'' Mr. Doggett said after today's vote, a procedural motion on a bill to repeal estate taxes.</p>
        <p>It was unclear which campaign finance bill would prevail by the time legislators left for the Fourth of July recess. The bill sponsored by Mr. Castle and Representative Amo Houghton, a New York Republican, would require all organizations that conduct political advocacy to identify their donors if they spend more than $10,000 on election-related advertisements in a calendar year.</p>
        <p>This approach casts a much broader net than Mr. Doggett's, covering not only dozens of the shadowy new groups formed under Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code that are springing up, but also other groups that advocate political causes, like the American Civil Liberties Union and the A.F.L.-C.I.O.</p>
        <p>Some independent experts who advocate an overhaul of campaign finance law opposed Mr. Castle's bill as overly broad. ''I just don't think it can hold up constitutionally,'' said Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a Washington group that supports changes in campaign finance law.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Wertheimer said that moderate Republicans like Mr. Castle and Representative Christopher Shays of Connecticut, a champion for a ban on unlimited donations called soft money, were legislating in good faith, he said he was wary of the motives of House Republican leaders. Many of the Section 527 groups have ties to top House Republicans, including the majority whip, Tom DeLay of Texas, and the Republican Conference chairman, J. C. Watts Jr. of Oklahoma, who have used them as effective campaign tools.</p>
        <p>''You can be used in these situations, and you have to be extraordinarily careful,'' Mr. Castle said in an interview. ''But I don't feel I'm being used.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Shays, in a telephone interview, said he was amenable to changing the bill to win support and sustain court challenges. ''I'm going to come down on what's comprehensive and constitutional,'' he said. ''What we're trying to get at is, what groups are involved in campaigns and how much money is being spent?''</p>
        <p>In a brief floor debate today, legislators clashed over the merits of focusing on the 527 organizations. These secretive groups, often with bland-sounding names like Republicans for Clean Air or Business Leaders for Sensible Priorities, cut across the political spectrum, raising money, buying television and radio advertisements, and conducting other political activities for liberal and conservative causes. They do not have to disclose their donors or spending as long as they do not expressly advocate voting for a candidate.</p>
        <p>''These stealthy political action committees could be getting money from the Communist Chinese, Colombian drug lords, the Mafia, who knows,'' said Representative Greg Ganske, Republican of Iowa.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Houghton argued that the Democratic bill was too narrow.  ''Why is it fair to the American people to protect some political activities and not others?'' he asked.</p>
        <p>Mr. Houghton said the Ways and Means Committee would hold hearings on the bill on June 20, with a floor vote to follow in about 10 days.</p>
        <p>Democrats announced they would begin a petition drive in the coming week to force the Republican leaders to bring Mr. Doggett's bill and a companion measure to a direct vote on the floor, not a procedural motion like today's.</p>
        <p>As House leaders scrambled to adjust to the shifting terrain on campaign finance, top Senate Republicans tried to regroup from Thursday's embarrassing debacle. Fourteen Republicans joined 43 Democrats in the 57-to-42 vote.</p>
        <p>Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader who had urged the defeat of Mr. McCain's measure, said in a hallway interview that he, too, favored a broader disclosure bill and would seek to negotiate with Mr. McCain on a new measure.</p>
        <p>The immediate fate of Mr. McCain's provision was unclear.</p>
