        <p>I'm one of the 140 employees laid off this week by APBNews.com, a news Web site that covered crime and justice. Like everything in the somewhat crazed atmosphere of an online news site, the scene of our firing felt somewhat  unreal.</p>

No fancy hospital techniques, decisions made at the speed of flying shrapnel. At the end of the day I would leave feeling spat out of an electronic beehive, a tiny worker in a striving industry.</p>

        <p>I'm one of the 140 employees laid off this week by APBNews.com, a news Web site that covered crime and justice. Like everything in the somewhat crazed atmosphere of an online news site, the scene of our firing felt somewhat  unreal.</p>
        <p>The business had always been conducted in an atmosphere of almost machine-like efficiency. With new material posted on the site four times each day, a great deal was written, edited, produced, formatted and slapped up online in little time and under constant pressure. Sometimes the pace reminded me of those speeches Alan Alda would make on ''M*A*S*H'' about the exigencies of wartime surgery. No fancy hospital techniques, decisions made at the speed of flying shrapnel. At the end of the day I would leave feeling spat out of an electronic beehive, a tiny worker in a striving industry.</p>
        <p>So when we were told on Monday that the company had no more money to pay us, it seemed too fast, like everything else we did. An entire workplace doesn't disappear in a week. But ours was about to. No one showed much emotion; I think we were too shocked. We drifted back to our desks and started to clean them out.</p>
        <p>But the company wanted to try to keep the site up until the end of the week in the hope that an investor  might come up with money to keep it going longer. We were offered the chance to help with this project -- without pay. At first I balked at this idea; I had other things I wanted to do. I packed up my things and left with vague promises that I'd be back sometime that week to help out.</p>
        <p>By the time I got home, the shock of losing income, stability and contact with co-workers had sunk in, and I cried for two hours. It hadn't been the job of my dreams, but I'd worked with the same people every day for eight months. We'd all lost our jobs in one fell swoop, and I hadn't even stayed to commiserate. It felt all wrong.</p>
        <p>The next day I went in, feeling strange as I walked through the lobby. What exactly did I hope to get? Closure? A proper goodbye with people I'd come to like and respect? Some shoes I'd left under my desk? I wasn't sure, but what I didn't expect was to find everyone there and business chugging along as usual.</p>
        <p>My emotional conflict about severing ties with the company became secondary as I was immediately handed two long stories to proofread. I read them without enthusiasm. I chatted with some friends who were working on job leads and updating their resumes. I was asked to edit some stories. Outside, rain was pouring down. I decided to stay and work, feeling strangely cozy at a departed copy editor's desk.</p>
        <p>A day went by. And I went back. Again, the place was alive with plenty of employees. Stories were still being written and edited, designed and put up on the site. I was given more work, and I did it with less resentment than I had the earlier day. I thought, this is sort of fun. A designer who used to work at the site but was between jobs had come back  to volunteer. He said something about how it was like the old days, when the staff had been ridiculously small for the volume of work. A supervisor joked that he was working harder than he had when he was being paid.</p>
        <p>Of course, it was different. As volunteers, we could come and go as we pleased. We could even work or not work, according to our needs. A lot of people used the computers to get job leads. Sandwiches appeared. There was a peculiar balance of our personal needs and our workplace needs.</p>
        <p>The world of work doesn't produce many weeks like this, weeks when you work not for money, but because you feel needed and because you feel a certain tie to a community that you had thought was held together entirely by everyone's financial interest. Somehow the atmosphere is better when the whole enterprise is trouble, because the uncertainty brings the workers in a company together against the outer world. You feel concern for the people involved, a desire to help, a sense of providing something of value.</p>
        <p>Why, when there was a monetary price on our work, were these feelings so much harder to come by?</p>
