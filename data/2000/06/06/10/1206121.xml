        <p>Dennis Paulson had an early wakeup call this morning, but rising before dawn was worth the effort.</p>
        <p>Making the most of his 7 a.m. tee time, Paulson took advantage of perfectly manicured greens and comfortable conditions, and protected his first-round lead at the Buick Classic. By the afternoon, it was clear that everyone else was playing catch-up, with Paulson already finished at nine under par (133), sitting in the clubhouse safer than someone in witness protection.</p>
        <p>Nobody caught Paulson today, and it remained to be seen if anyone would overtake him this weekend. But after today's three-under-par 68, his fourth consecutive round in the 60's at Westchester Country Club, Paulson held a two-stroke lead over Skip Kendall (seven under after a 68) heading into Saturday's third round. Joey Sindelar, who shot 68, was in third place at six under, and David Duval, the world's No. 2-ranked player, vaulted into fourth place at five under par after a solid round of 67.</p>
        <p>Paulson was fortunate to play in the day's first group because the course became more difficult as the day progressed. The wind increased and the afternoon sun dried the course considerably, making the greens and fairways harder and faster. Instead of settling safely in the fairway, tee shots began rolling into the deep rough. Instead of settling on the green, approach shots began to bounce past the flag, leaving players with difficult chip shots or speedy downhill putts.</p>
        <p>Many players left the course grumbling late this afternoon, but by that time, Paulson already had enough time to eat lunch, take a shower and look forward to a weekend on a course on which he feels comfortable.</p>
        <p>''I like hard golf courses, and this is a hard golf course,'' said Paulson, who lost last year's Buick Classic to Duffy Waldorf in a sudden-death playoff. ''It's the hardest short course we play on tour, by far.</p>
        <p>''This course plays really hard when all the pins are in the front, and there were a lot of front pins today. It's hard to get it close to the hole. It's not hard to make pars, but hard to make birdies.''</p>
        <p>The only player who strung numerous birdies together was Scott Gump, who needed just 23 putts to shoot the day's best round, a 64, and move into a tie for 11th place. But others struggled. Waldorf, Davis Love III and Miguel Angel Jimenez started the day tied for second place just one stroke off the lead, but all lost ground. Waldorf fell five strokes behind after a 72, while Love (74) and Jimenez (74) fell seven strokes off the lead.</p>
        <p>''Westchester has a way of dealing out some pain, and today it was dealing out some pain,'' Waldorf said.</p>
        <p>But Duval stormed up the leader board by shooting five under par over his last 11 holes. He said he had great expectations before the tournament started. And seeing his name on the leader board will only add to his confidence.</p>
        <p>''I know right now that I'm playing well enough to start winning golf tournaments,'' said Duval, who is looking for his first victory since April of last year. ''I'm hitting the ball well and I'm starting to make putts. It's just a matter of putting it all together.''</p>
        <p>Unlike Tiger Woods, who decided to take this week off, Duval believes that the Buick Classic will only sharpen his game for the United States Open next week at Pebble Beach, Calif.</p>
        <p>''If I can experience all those feelings this week, the nervousness of being in contention, having to hit shots under pressure, I think it has to help me,'' he said. ''I'm looking forward to what's ahead.''</p>
        <p>Duval will be trying to put more pressure this weekend on Paulson and Kendall, two players who have yet to win on tour. The 5-foot-8-inch Kendall finished 38th on last year's money list; he makes his living hitting fairways, and the Westchester course plays to his strengths.</p>
        <p>''Last year I came here and played terrible, missed the cut by a ton,'' Kendall said. ''But I feel like it's a course that does suit my game. I only missed one fairway today.''</p>
        <p>But after almost winning this event last year, Paulson hoped this weekend would be his turn. What better way to prepare for Pebble Beach than with a victory?</p>
        <p>''I live in California,'' Paulson said. ''I had to fly all the way here, and fly all the way back. Unless you're a guy like Tiger that just likes to take a week off before a major, there's no reason why you should not come and play. If you're playing in the Open, you want to be playing well going in.''</p>
        <p>CHIP SHOTS</p>
        <p>Four players ranked among the world's top 50 missed the two-over-par cut: TOM LEHMAN (three over par), JOSE MARIA OLAZABAL (three over), BOB TWAY (five over) and JEFF MAGGERT (10 over). . . . ROCCO MEDIATE withdrew today after an opening-round 75. . . . Notable players who will try to make up ground in the final two rounds this weekend include ERNIE ELS (three under par), PHIL MICKELSON (three under), CHRIS PERRY (three under), FRED COUPLES (two under), JIM FURYK (two under), JESPER PARNEVIK (one under), VIJAY SINGH (one under), GREG NORMAN (one over), STEVE ELKINGTON (one over), SHIGEKI MARUYAMA (one over) and SERGIO GARCIA (two over).</p>
