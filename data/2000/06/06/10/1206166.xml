      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Roxelana, a 3-year-old filly with a perfect 4-for-4 record built in Louisiana and Kentucky, came to New York yesterday and found that life could be difficult. She was leading nine rivals in the Acorn Stakes, the opening race in the Triple Tiara series for filles, but she was overtaken by Finder's Fee and C'Est L'Amour, and finished third.</p>
        <p>Finder's Fee is a daughter of Storm Cat and a hometown regular owned by Ogden Phipps and trained by Shug McGaughey, and this was her fifth victory in 11 career starts. At the close, she had three-quarters of a length on C'Est L'Amour, who held off Roxelana by a neck. ''We have no excuses,'' said Blackie Huffman, who trains Roxelana for William L. S. Landes III. ''We just got beat by some good fillies. We'll go back home now and give her a little break and let her rest from the shipping and the race, and try again.''</p>

        <p>Finder's Fee ran the mile under John Velazquez in 1:371/5 , returned $18.60 for a $2 bet to win and earned $120,000. McGaughey said her next start would probably come in the Mother Goose at a mile and an eighth on July 1, the second race in the series.</p>
