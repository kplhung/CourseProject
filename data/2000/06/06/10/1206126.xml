        <p>This is a jumpy place at the best of times, so when the earth started shaking last Sunday before midnight, the locals took no chances. Dozens of people fled their high-rise apartments, as windows rattled and water sloshed out of pools.</p>
        <p>Jakarta was merely feeling the tremors of an earthquake near Sumatra, 335 miles away. But it was one more jolt for a country that churns with fear of a looming political and economic upheaval. As with the distant earthquake, those fears are probably exaggerated.</p>
        <p>Two years after a calamitous economic downturn, Indonesia is springing back. Sales of cars and motorcycles have taken off since January: there is a five-month wait for a new Kijang, Indonesia's ubiquitous boxy van. Sales of palm oil and other exports are thriving. Measured by economic output, exports and consumer demand, Indonesia is in a remarkable recovery.</p>
        <p>The trouble is, the revival has been obscured by political instability. Few other countries could report a 36 percent increase in exports in the first four months of 2000 -- as Indonesia did June 2 -- and watch the stock market sink to its lowest level of the year. The Indonesian rupiah has fallen 20 percent since January, reminiscent of the Asian crisis.</p>
        <p>''When you travel around the country, you see an economy that is absolutely booming,'' said Mark Baird, the country director of the World Bank. ''But there is a huge disconnect between the underlying economy and the confidence of investors.''</p>
        <p>Unlike Malaysia and South Korea, which are enjoying export-led recoveries, Indonesia seems stuck with the label ''sick man of Asia.'' While foreign investors are returning to Kuala Lumpur and Seoul, they avoid Jakarta, where the deluxe hotels are half empty and guests are apt to be journalists seeking stories rather than businessmen seeking deals.</p>
        <p>Political analysts said Indonesia's president, Abdurrahman Wahid, deserves much of the blame for the country's image. After winning acclaim last June for holding its first democratic elections in four decades, Indonesia, in the critics' view, has frittered away its good will overseas with a rudderless economic policy, byzantine political intrigue and a sordid parade of scandals.</p>
        <p>''Wahid knows about politics and religious matters, but he doesn't know anything about economics,'' said Sofyan Wanandi, an ethnic Chinese tycoon who advises the president. ''The only quality he brings is common sense.''</p>
        <p>Yet common sense is precisely what has been lacking. Mr. Wahid precipitated the most recent slide in the rupiah by firing two respected cabinet ministers and replacing them with people perceived as cronies. He installed his younger brother in a top job at the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency, responsible for cleaning up insolvent banks and companies.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Wahid picked a public fight with Syahril Sabirin, the governor of the central bank, Bank Indonesia. Mr. Sabirin is supposed to answer only to Indonesia's parliament. But the president has been pressing him to resign since he was implicated in a financial scandal.</p>
        <p>''The thinking was, Wahid was cleaner and would run a more transparent government than his predecessors,'' said Bill Kaye, senior managing director of the Pacific Group, a hedge fund in Hong Kong. ''But he's been a disappointment.''</p>
        <p>The intrigue in the capital is at least peaceful. Outside Jakarta, a string of mysterious church bombings in Sumatra and the grisly sectarian violence in the Maluku islands are leading some foreign investors to conclude that Indonesia is too dangerous a place to build factories.</p>
        <p>Juwono Sudarsono, the defense minister, said the breakdown in law and order was an unavoidable consequence of Mr. Wahid's much-praised decision to remove the military from law enforcement. Mr. Sudarsono said it would be three to five years before the civilian police were strong enough to fill the vacuum.</p>
        <p>He said the director of Exxon Mobil's operations in the province of Aceh, which is rich in natural gas, had recently expressed worries about security outside his plant. The same fears plague American mining companies with operations on the far eastern island of Irian Jaya. Last Sunday, 3,000 tribal leaders in Irian Jaya held a congress to declare their independence from Indonesia.</p>
        <p>''In the last two months, our confidence evaporated again,'' said an American investor with operations in Indonesia, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ''Unfortunately, the second time your confidence evaporates, it's harder to get it back.''</p>
        <p>Even Indonesia's critics note that it does not have much leeway in economic policy. Under its loan agreement with the International Monetary Fund, Indonesia must follow strict guidelines on fiscal and monetary policy.</p>
        <p>The government flirted briefly with imposing capital controls to halt the decline in the rupiah. But after the managing director of the I.M.F., Horst Kohler, expressed his disapproval, the idea died.</p>
        <p>Still, Indonesia's policy makers seem to have violated the first rule: do no harm. The senior economics minister, Kwik Kian Gie, knocked several points off the rupiah in May by remarking that he did not see why foreign investors would come to Indonesia. He also commented that the rupiah could trade as low as 10,000 to the dollar -- compared with its current level of 8,600.</p>
        <p>''Over the last year, you have seen a lot of Indonesians rising to their level of incompetence,'' said H. S. Dillon, an economic analyst in Jakarta. ''You have policy makers who don't know how to make policy.''</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, Mr. Wahid has taken control of economic policy himself. Mr. Kwik is likely to be shuffled out of the cabinet in a few months; he did not respond to a request for an interview.</p>
        <p>The lack of direction is particularly harmful to the Bank Restructuring Agency, which is struggling to unload hundreds of debt-burdened banks and companies. The agency has made some progress, but experts said it could move far more aggressively if the Finance Ministry did not second-guess its plans.</p>
        <p>Despite all the drawbacks, some investors who spurned Indonesia are reconsidering, in part because assets are so cheap. Dasa Sutantio, the head of the asset management division of the agency, calls them ''Rambo investors.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kaye of the Pacific Group said: ''Indonesia is never that far away from busting loose at the seams. But I kind of like it, because at least you're starting to get a decent return to be there.''</p>
        <p>President Wahid himself is joining the effort to lure back foreign money. He is traveling to New York next week to speak to a group of investors. The pressure is considerable: if Indonesia does not fortify the spending boom by attracting investment, the recovery could end.</p>
        <p>Indonesia's prospects will depend on Mr. Wahid, whose hand was strengthened this week when his vice president, Megawati Sukarnoputri, pledged not to try to oust him at an upcoming session of the national assembly.</p>
        <p>The president's advisers plead for patience. ''This transition is taking longer than we expected,'' Mr. Wanandi, the presidential adviser, said. ''But we just got through 40 years of dictatorship.''</p>
