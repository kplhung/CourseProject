        <p>He said he was exhausted and angry. He did not want to talk anymore about his four-month ordeal that began with him facing murder charges in Atlanta and ended this week with his being put on 12 months of probation. Ray Lewis did talk, though, at a news conference today at the Baltimore Ravens' offices. He talked about the past and the future in an attempt for closure.</p>
        <p>Lewis, 25, will return to the Ravens' minicamp practice on Monday a more seasoned man.</p>
        <p>That was obvious from the passionate way the star linebacker spoke about his faith, his family, his responsibilities and his frightful experience.</p>
        <p>''To be totally honest, this was something I did not want to do,'' Lewis said about today's appearance, which the Ravens' majority owner, Art Modell, insisted he make. ''A lot of people here have said a lot of negative things about me.</p>
        <p>''I've faced fourth down and one many times, but never fourth down and life. This was something I had never been through before. I'm angry at the prosecutors who should have known all along that I was innocent of the murder charges. I'm angry at the situation I put my family, teammates and fans in. I take responsibility for that. Two weeks of jail is hard, but one of my daily rituals was to read the mail fans sent me and there was a lot of support. This took me to a totally different level than I've ever been before. I do not think I can express to anyone what I've been through. I wouldn't want to wish this experience on my worst enemy.</p>
        <p>''What I honestly learned is no matter who you are, how much money you have or who you think you know, if someone wants to accuse you of something, they will. But I think good can come out of anything bad. Everybody stumbles but it is not about the stumble but about the recovery. I know that after Ray Lewis, there are still two people dead. I have two children myself and I would never want to hurt anyone's child. All I can do for their families is pray for them.''</p>
        <p>Lewis and two friends, Joseph Sweeting, 34, and Reginald Oakley, 31, were charged with the stabbing deaths of Jacinth Baker, 21, and Richard Lollar, 24. The killings occurred in the early morning hours of Jan. 31 on the streets outside of an Atlanta nightclub. It happened only a few hours after Super Bowl XXXIV had been played only a few miles away in the Georgia Dome.</p>
        <p>Lewis was arrested and charged, and spent two weeks in an Atlanta jail. He was then granted bond, prepared for his trial and then saw it end nearly as quickly as it began. After suffering some setbacks in their case, prosecutors dropped the murder charges against Lewis last Monday. He pleaded to an obstruction of justice charge, a misdemeanor, for initially not cooperating with police, and agreed to testify against his co-defendants. Sweeting and Oakley remain on trial, and the prosecution made its closing arguments in the case today.</p>
        <p>Lewis testified on Tuesday to what he saw happen the night of the killings. About his initial statements to police and his advice to his friends involved to ''keep your mouth shut,'' Lewis said: ''I did not know what to do or how to react in that situation. I was in a situation I had never been in before. And one of the hardest things was when my oldest child, Ray III, walked up to me and said, 'Daddy, why are you wearing those chains?' I told him, 'We're just playing, son.' And I don't like lying to my son. That was hard.''</p>
        <p>The National Football League has said Lewis would not be suspended but could be fined. Lewis said he was looking for closure. So are all of the Ravens, who Lewis said have welcomed him back ''with open arms.''</p>
        <p>Coach Brian Billick said: ''He believed in the process and now the process has been completed. He is innocent and he is home and we today begin closing this chapter.''</p>
        <p>Lewis, when asked if he had learned a lesson about the company he kept, answered by saying that ''God has a plan for all of us and things are going to happen.''</p>
        <p>His lawyer, Ed Garland, continued, saying: ''Ray did not really finish his thought there because I know we have talked long about that. I don't think you're going to see Ray Lewis in a limousine again with a cast of characters. I don't think you're going to see him hanging outside of a club in the early-morning hours in troublesome places. He will set up a system in his life where a lot of the hangers-ons that have latched onto him will be kept at a distance. Ray is like a lot of 25-year-olds that didn't know exactly how in the past to carve a way to do that. He'll find it.''</p>
