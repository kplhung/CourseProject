        <p>SHORTLY after he decided this week to accept the offer to become superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District, Roy Romer called his oldest child, Mark, 47, to deliver the news. Mark wasted no time telling his 71-year-old father, a former three-term Democratic governor of Colorado, ''You need counseling.''</p>
        <p>Now, sitting at a conference table in his new office, bare but for the furniture and a late afternoon lunch of milk and cookies, Mr. Romer threw back his head and laughed at the insouciance of his progeny.</p>
        <p>''Look,'' he said, turning serious, ''I've always been a risk-taker. That's something in my nature, I guess. I like tough jobs. I like new things. But if you bring skills to the table, how can you justify not using them? I can't just go back to the stream in Colorado to fish. That's not the way to go.''</p>
        <p>As a lawyer, rancher, flight-school owner, ski-resort operator, state lawmaker, state treasurer, governor for 12 years and general chairman of the Democratic National Committee for 2, when the party was reeling from debt and presidential scandal, Mr. Romer has encountered his fair share of challenges.</p>
        <p>But nothing, he conceded, compares to the task at hand: lifting the nation's second-largest school district, with 711,000 students, out of a quagmire, practical and psychological, caused by overcrowded classrooms, crumbling buildings, falling test scores, uninterested teachers and battles among ethnic groups.</p>
        <p>In addition, negotiations with the union representing the district's 35,000 teachers are proceeding slowly only four weeks before their contract expires, and some state lawmakers are proposing to appoint a monitor to oversee the schools.</p>
        <p>Efforts to decentralize the bloated bureaucracy are already under way as a result of a major reorganization started by Ramon C. Cortines, who was made interim superintendent after a newly elected school board voted Ruben Zacarias out of office last year. Smaller districts are seen as a solution to problems like those at Cahuenga Elementary School in East Hollywood, which opened in 1909 to accommodate 400 children and now serves 1,300, leaving 1,400 others in the neighborhood to board 40 buses at 6 o'clock each morning to attend 15 other schools. More than a quarter of the district's 790 schools are already open year-round to relieve overcrowding.</p>
        <p>But reorganization is only a first step, Mr. Romer said, laying out a holistic approach that he favors. He wants new pressure exerted on parents to get involved, on teachers to get motivated (or face ''the f word, 'fired' ''), on students to stay focused and on administrators to begin periodic testing of classroom achievement.</p>
        <p>''You ought not to rely on this place to deliver an education to you,'' he warned a group of high schoolers on Thursday, implicitly acknowledging the magnitude of problems he had inherited. ''You ought to go out and get it.''</p>
        <p>So why would a septuagenarian who has accomplished so much as a public servant take on a job that could require years beyond his tenure -- he expects to sign a contract for two or three years -- to show any dramatic improvement? And why would a father of 7 and a grandfather of 18 want to disrupt a comfortable life, dragging his wife of 47 years, Bea, away from a Denver home they bought six months ago and their 500-acre cattle ranch in Bailey, Colo., in exchange for a rented house or apartment in Los Angeles?</p>
        <p>The reasons, he said, lie in his restless spirit.</p>
        <p>AFTER leaving the governorship in January 1999, Mr. Romer cast about for a new focus and turned his energies to a priority he had set in office: educational reform through standards, goals and accountability. But speaking with community groups around the country to absorb new ideas, he had only vague notions of how to start a ''national conversation,'' perhaps through a new research organization or maybe town-hall-style meetings. In any case, he contemplated an academic, rather than hands-on, approach.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, a shift in the Democratic Party leadership this January brought in Edward G. Rendell, former mayor of Philadelphia and a master money-raiser, as the new general chairman, ended Mr. Romer's stewardship after two years and moved him to a job as chairman of the party's national convention, which will be held here in August.</p>
        <p>That required him to spend several days each week here. On one visit, Eli Broad, a prominent businessman and philanthropist, suggested that if he was really interested in improving education, he would apply for the schools job.</p>
        <p>''It had never occurred to me,'' Mr. Romer said. ''I could have started a think tank, but then I realized it was more important to walk the walk than to talk the talk.''</p>
        <p>As other candidates, including former Housing Secretary Henry G. Cisneros, removed themselves from consideration, Mr. Romer emerged as the front-runner. And on Tuesday the school board offered him the job, even though he had no formal background as an educator. Mr. Romer was born in Garden City, Kan., and moved to Colorado as a baby. He received a degree in agricultural economics from Colorado State University in 1950 and a law degree from the University of Colorado two years later.</p>
        <p>''The lifestyle change will cost me a lot,'' he said of his new job, extending his rugged hands to explain. ''Look at them. I was out ranching last weekend, working in meadows, putting in culverts, repairing ditches. I enjoy that ranch and drinking good cabernet with friends at the end of the day. This is going to disrupt that in spades.''</p>
        <p>''But I didn't treat this decision lightly,'' he added. ''I thought very, very deeply about it. I know it's a real gamble and far more challenging than being governor. But I decided I would rather go out working than sitting.''</p>
