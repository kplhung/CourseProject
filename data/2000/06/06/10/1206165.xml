        <p>Three New York City taxi drivers filed a class-action lawsuit yesterday on behalf of the city's entire fleet of 41,000 yellow-cab drivers, saying  that city officials should not be allowed to immediately revoke or suspend the licenses of cabbies who fail to pick up blacks or other members of minority groups.</p>
        <p>In their lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, the cabbies argued that a city program, which went into effect in November under the name Operation Refusal, deprived them of their Fourth Amendment rights to due process.</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani established Operation Refusal after the actor Danny Glover protested last fall that he had been passed by and treated rudely by New York City cabdrivers.</p>
        <p>''While this complaint is longstanding -- and no one denies it is legitimate and often true -- the difference this time was a movie star was talking, and the Taxi and Limousine Commission quickly reacted,'' the lawsuit said. ''The T.L.C.'s reaction was contrary to the law governing service refusals.''</p>
        <p>The cabbies, who are seeking to end the program and to receive an unspecified amount of damages, contended that the commission's own rules already contained specific punishments for drivers who refused to pick up customers. Those rules, according to the lawsuit, stipulate that cabbies can have their licenses suspended only after a second offense and revoked only if three offenses occur within three years.</p>
        <p>According to the lawsuit, more than 100 cabbies have had their licenses revoked or suspended under Operation Refusal, including two of the three named plaintiffs, John Padberg and Rashid Ahmed.</p>
        <p>David Hind, chief of staff of the commission, refused to comment on the lawsuit.</p>
