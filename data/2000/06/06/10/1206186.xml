        <p>A police officer in the Street Crime Unit was charged with misdemeanor assault yesterday in the shooting of an unarmed Bronx teenager last year. The boy's mother said the charge should have been more serious, and police union officials said there should have been no charges at all.</p>
        <p>The officer, Mark Conway, 33, was charged with third-degree assault in the shooting of Dantae Johnson, now 17, on May 26, 1999. On the recommendation of prosecutors, Officer Conway was released on his own recognizance. He was suspended from the police force for a maximum of 30 days.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson and a friend fled when Officer Conway and two other officers approached to frisk them on suspicion that Mr. Johnson was armed. When Officer Conway caught up to Mr. Johnson in his car, he grabbed him with one hand and pulled his gun out with the other.</p>
        <p>The gun discharged, wounding Mr. Johnson so seriously in the stomach that he spent six months in the hospital, had 13 operations and can now walk only with braces, prosecutors and his family say.</p>
        <p>''He cannot wear shorts. He cannot do nothing. He is completely changed,'' his mother, Sharon Johnson, said after the arraignment yesterday. ''And they say it was an accident, not intentional.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Johnson was referring to the indictment, which accuses Officer Conway of causing physical injury by criminal negligence, meaning he failed to perceive a substantial risk that the injury would have occurred.</p>
        <p>She said that the Bronx district attorney, Robert T. Johnson, had told her yesterday morning that ''he did not feel the police officer meant to harm my son.''</p>
        <p>''Mr. Johnson,'' she said, ''I need an explanation. My son needs an explanation. The city needs an explanation.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson said the grand jury had rejected a felony assault charge for the officer, who testified before the panel last week. Officer Conway also gave a statement to prosecutors. ''He still has to account for his actions,'' Mr. Johnson said.</p>
        <p>But Patrick Lynch, the president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, said that Officer Conway should not have to account for an accident. ''This is a case where politics has taken over for what really happened,'' Mr. Lynch said. ''This case should not be in this courthouse.''</p>
        <p>The shooting of Dantae Johnson happened just a few months after Amadou Diallo was fatally shot in the Bronx. Both men are black and were unarmed, and the officers who shot them are white members of the Street Crime Unit.</p>
        <p>The Johnson case also shares some elements with the Patrick Dorismond case, in which Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani was denounced by critics for what they said were insensitive comments about Mr. Dorismond, who was shot by a police officer earlier this year. After Dantae Johnson was shot, Police Commissioner Howard Safir questioned why his mother had allowed him to be on the street so late at night, and suggested he might have had a reason to be running from the police.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson's lawyers, Johnnie L. Cochran, Peter J. Neufeld, Barry C. Scheck and Sanford A. Rubenstein, are using those comments, as well as the release of information concerning a previous arrest of Mr. Johnson, which is supposed to be sealed because he is a juvenile, to sue the city, the mayor and the police commissioner.</p>
        <p>Within minutes of the shooting, Mr. Neufeld said, Mr. Johnson was arrested, first for criminal possession of a weapon, then for robbery. Both charges were dropped.</p>
        <p>The case was deemed a ''special case,'' meaning it will be expedited, and it was assigned to Judge Troy K. Webber.</p>
