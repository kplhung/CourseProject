        <p>In a rare judicial step, a New Jersey appeals panel today ordered the parole of a 62-year-old convict who has been imprisoned since 1964 for pistol-whipping and fatally shooting two Lodi police officers in a highway bar.</p>
        <p>The unanimous ruling by a three-judge panel of the Appellate Division instructed the New Jersey Parole Board to release the inmate, Thomas Trantino, in 30 days. He is serving a life sentence from which the only release is parole.</p>
        <p>The order represents a major victory for Mr. Trantino, who has been in state prison longer than any other New Jersey inmate and has been campaigning for freedom for 20 years, over the loud objections of many in Bergen County, where the officers were killed in August 1963.</p>
        <p>The judges told the State Department of Corrections to transfer Mr. Trantino immediately to a halfway house or residential center as preparation for his release. But in response to a request by the state attorney general, the judges ordered a temporary postponement of the transfer, said Chuck Davis, a spokesman for Attorney General John J. Farmer Jr.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis said that on Monday the panel would review Mr. Farmer's request that it also set aside the order to release Mr. Trantino in 30 days while the Whitman administration appeals it to the State Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>The judges' order rankled parole board officials, who said that Mr. Trantino was only the second state prison inmate in history to win court-ordered parole. The other, a man serving 10 years for molesting a 10-year-old girl, was ordered released this week by another appeals panel, said Michael Carlin, deputy executive director of the parole board.</p>
        <p>Mr. Carlin said the two orders ''raised very serious legal issues'' about the courts interfering with the workings of the executive branch of government.</p>
        <p>The ruling also touched off a new round of protest by Bergen County and municipal officials, representatives of seven police departments and survivors of the two slain officers, Sgt. Peter Voto, 40, and Gary Tedesco, a 22-year-old rookie patrolman. For years, the county's elected representatives and law enforcement officials have argued, in rallies and candlelight vigils, that parole for Mr. Trantino would be disrespectful to the memories of the two officers.</p>
        <p>Against this heated political backdrop, the parole board has rejected nine parole applications from Mr. Trantino since he became eligible in 1980. And today's appellate ruling suggests that the state's judicial system has grown impatient with the board's handling of Mr. Trantino's case and its legal reasoning for the latest rejection, which was issued last June.</p>
        <p>The three judges -- Michael P. King, John E. Wallace and Robert A. Fall -- found that the parole board's conclusions and findings were unreasonable, based on the evidence in Mr. Trantino's file, and conveyed a ''sense of wrongness.'' The judges said the state's parole laws and standards required them to intervene and reverse the board, which had failed to adequately consider the ''substantial and positive'' factors in Mr. Trantino's parole application.</p>
        <p>In the 1990's, other appellate panels and the New Jersey Supreme Court, the state's highest tribunal, found flaws in the parole board's rejections of Mr. Trantino's applications. But those rulings always instructed the board to again review Mr. Trantino's case. This time, the appeals judges did not remand the case, and instead ordered the parole in 30 days.</p>
        <p>Mr. Farmer, the state attorney general, said today that Gov. Christine Todd Whitman had instructed him to appeal the case. In a written statement, he said the parole board believed that Mr. Trantino had no plan for life after parole, could not handle stress and was easily agitated and prone to violence.</p>
        <p>''This lethal combination created an unacceptable risk of recidivism,''  he said. In a ruling in May 1998, the State Supreme Court refined the legal standard for Mr. Trantino's parole, saying he should be freed unless the parole board found a ''substantial likelihood'' that Mr. Trantino would commit a crime after parole. The court also suggested that Mr. Trantino did not pose such a risk and told the board to look at his case again.</p>
        <p>Today's ruling said the board had not properly applied the 1998 ''substantial likelihood'' standard. In part, the decision said, the board had improperly based its rejection on the opinion of a board psychologist, Glen Ferguson, who in the mid-1990's favored parole but in 1999 reversed himself and said that Mr. Trantino had the potential for committing new violent crimes if freed.</p>
        <p>After today's ruling, about 30 police officers from Lodi and surrounding towns gathered outside Lodi's municipal building, next to an eagle-topped memorial to Sergeant Voto and Officer Tedesco. The Bergen County executive, William P. Schuber, vowed to fight what he called a ''wrong, wrong decision.''</p>
        <p>Andrew Voto, the 74-year-old brother of Sergeant Voto and Lodi's former police chief, now partly paralyzed from a stroke, denounced Mr. Trantino.</p>
        <p>''I want a message delivered to Trantino,'' said Mr. Voto, leaning on a metal cane. ''I hate your guts and I'll follow you to the grave, no matter how crippled I am.''</p>
