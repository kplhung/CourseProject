      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial says Mayor Rudolph W Giuliani is right to fight cost-of-living increase for retired New York City workers unless Gov George E Pataki and Legislature provide the state money to help pay for it, but says Giuliani has undercut his position by proposing to tap $800 million from pension fund contributions due this year and next to close city's deficits (M)</p>

        <p>One of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's proudest boasts is that he has restored fiscal discipline at City Hall. Lately, however, a different story has unfolded. New York City's spending growth is running at more than twice the rate of inflation, and borrowing is spiraling so fast that the city needs state legislative approval to exceed its debt ceiling.</p>
        <p>Now Mr. Giuliani has made the picture worse with a pension ploy announced a few weeks ago. Since the pension funds are flush because of the stock market, he has proposed tapping $800 million from contributions due this year and next. The money is to be used to close city budget deficits in the current year and the one beginning July 1. To win union permission for that scheme, he agreed to let 200,000 municipal workers cut back on their own contributions to the system, raising their take-home pay by 3 percent. That step will cost the city $300 million a year in the future.</p>

        <p>One of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's proudest boasts is that he has restored fiscal discipline at City Hall. Lately, however, a different story has unfolded.

        <p>Now Mr. Giuliani has made the picture worse with a pension ploy announced a few weeks ago. Since the pension funds are flush because of the stock market, he has proposed tapping $800 million from contributions due this year and next. The money is to be used to close city budget deficits in the current year and the one beginning July 1. To win union permission for that scheme, he agreed to let 200,000 municipal workers cut back on their own contributions to the system, raising their take-home pay by 3 percent. That step will cost the city $300 million a year in the future.</p>
        <p>State workers have won a separate agreement from Gov. George Pataki and State Comptroller Carl McCall for a cost-of-living increase for retirees. The state pension funds can afford it, but the governor and the Legislature are also planning to apply it to the city, where the Giuliani administration says it could cost $700 million a year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani warns that without additional state aid to help pay for the state-mandated cost-of-living hike for retirees, tax cuts proposed for next year may have to be rescinded. But the mayor would be more persuasive if he had not already showed poor judgment on pensions.</p>
