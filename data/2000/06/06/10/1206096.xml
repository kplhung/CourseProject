        <p>Eward Rothstein article on competing demands of cyberspace anarchists who argue that intellectual property should be freely available and commercial survival of publishing and recording industries, who are trying to maintain copyright protections; says Internet will evolve as complex mixture of controls and liberties; holds value of information should be honored, but its transmission should be free; photo (M)</p>

        <p>There was some perverse pleasure to be had last month as the heavy metal band Metallica sued the Web company Napster for copyright infringement.

        <p>There was some perverse pleasure to be had last month as the heavy metal band Metallica sued the Web company Napster for copyright infringement. Here is a band that invokes the hounds of hell and mocks gentility with shrieking sarcasm, suddenly championing bourgeois values by insisting on royalty payments. And here are legions  of college students supposedly championing Metallican values -- undermining corporate greed, attacking propriety -- when what they are really after in downloading songs from Napster is free music.</p>
        <p>Such is the bad faith of contemporary rebellion. But it doesn't end there. Napster itself, the creation of a 19-year-old programmer, Shawn Fanning, has already attracted $15 million in venture capital with its sly appeal to freeloading music lovers. It claims to be innocent of copyright violation because all it is really doing is arranging a match between one user who wants a song and another user who has it.</p>
        <p>Napster might have been less coy and acknowledged that it is actually part of a movement challenging copyright and intellectual property. Its goals are shared, for example, by a new program called Freenet, which has been described by its creator, Ian Clarke, 23, as an example of ''near-perfect anarchy.'' Freenet will trump Napster, also allowing free, anonymous distribution of video, software and books. But isn't this stealing? Can't information be seen as a form of property? Not for Mr. Clarke, who says that idea will soon be considered as ridiculous as witch-burning.</p>
        <p>This challenge to copyright is made possible, of course, by advances in technological piracy, but it also grows out of a set of ideas that have been associated with the Internet from its earliest public years. Many Internet visionaries were inspired by countercultural notions of the Net's liberatory possibilities. John Perry Barlow, a Grateful Dead lyricist, later became co-founder of the influential Electronic Frontier Foundation, an organization dedicated to preserving the Internet's libertarian terrain. He has argued that familiar notions of intellectual property become ''towers of outmoded boilerplate'' when applied to online information.</p>
        <p>Stewart Brand, a creator of The Whole Earth Catalog, went on to found the WELL -- Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link -- in which veterans of a California commune helped build one of the first online communities. Mr. Brand famously declared, ''Information wants to be free,'' a mantra that has become a rallying cry for copyright challenges.</p>
        <p>This romantic vision sees cyberspace as a realm fundamentally different from ordinary life. And it has become increasingly difficult to separate this belief from important political, technological and ideological debates over copyright, privacy and security. There is a hint of its influence, for example, in the Web pages of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University (cyber.law.harvard.edu), which argue that the Internet should foster  ''open governance'' and collaborative, public-domain ''open'' software. It has proposed that a counter-copyright sign, [cc], be used by authors willing to reject copyright, with its more familiar $;.</p>
        <p>The most important intellectual defense of these views has been made by Lawrence Lessig, a fellow of the Berkman Center and professor at Harvard Law School. His recent book, ''Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace'' (Basic Books) includes a closely argued brief for protecting the freedoms of ''original cyberspace'' from the constraints imposed by commerce or copyright. Far from being at risk, Mr. Lessig argues, copyright is ''protected far too well.'' In fact, he says, it is ''more effectively protected than at any time since Gutenberg.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lessig's concern is about software code that will protect copyrights by rigidly metering usage and limiting access. The danger, he suggests, is the shrinking of the ''public commons,'' a realm in which intellectual work becomes part of a culture's shared heritage. Mr. Lessig argues that copyright law should itself be limited when applied to cyberspace.</p>
        <p>How, though, is cultural commerce to thrive? The publishing and recording industries must be drastically recast to account for digital copying and distribution. And even Mr. Lessig acknowledges that ''some intellectual property rights'' are needed as an incentive to creators. This means that some form of technological control is also required.</p>
        <p>But it is not necessary to imagine that everything will be controlled any more than it is possible to envision that nothing will be. If privacy and security can be protected, there will be a wide range of economic arrangements, just as there are now. Some cultural products will be publicly available. Some will be available only through subscription payments. And some will be available in the familiar pay-per-view or rental form that Mr. Lessig finds so disturbing in cyberspace.</p>
        <p>None of this means the constriction of the public commons. Cyberspace will be just as fraught with complex mixtures of controls and liberties as real space. Mr. Lessig may find the prospects so grim because his fears and hopes are largely based on an idealized vision of ''freedoms that were foundational'' in the origins of the Internet.</p>
        <p>That was a time (just over five years ago) when the Internet was public in concept but limited in its scope. There was no commerce or banking, little need to worry over security or privacy, minimal threat of mass piracy or viral sabotage. Mr. Lessig treats that exceptional era as the model for aspiration. In comparison, what reality won't seem threatening?</p>
        <p>A world without a public commons, though, will not come about from copyright protection but from the opposite. Information doesn't want to be free; only the transmission of information wants to be free. Information, like culture, is the result of labor and devotion, investment and risk; it has a value. And nothing will lead to a more deafening cultural silence than ignoring that value and celebrating the ''near-perfect anarchy'' of Freenet and Napster running amok.</p>
