        <p>Three crows found dead -- two in New York State and one in New Jersey -- were confirmed yesterday as this year's first known victims of the West Nile virus, the mosquito-borne disease that killed seven people in New York City last year, health officials said.</p>

        <p>Three crows found dead -- two in New York State and one in New Jersey -- were confirmed yesterday as this year's first known victims of the West Nile virus, the mosquito-borne disease that killed seven people in New York City last year, health officials said.</p>
        <p>In New York, one male and one female crow, believed to be a mating pair that had been in the area since March, were found near each other by passers-by in New City on May 22,  and taken first to the Rockland County Health Department. The West Nile virus was confirmed as the cause of the two birds' death yesterday, said Ward Stone, the chief wildlife pathologist for the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation.</p>
        <p>Dr. Stone said tests on the bird carcasses performed at the state's Wadsworth Laboratory in Guilderland, N.Y., near Albany, found heart lesions, enlarged livers and spleens, and evidence of weight loss, which are signs of West Nile infection.</p>
        <p>''These would be the first cases of West Nile Virus confirmed in the state, and I believe, anywhere in the country this year,'' Dr. Stone said.</p>
        <p>In New Jersey, the Department of Health and Senior Services announced that a crow found in River Edge, in Bergen County, 15 miles south of New City, was confirmed to have died from the virus. Christine Grant, New Jersey's health commissioner, said the bird was believed to have been newly infected. Dr. Stone  said the Rockland County birds had also been newly infected, and were believed to have contracted the virus from mosquito bites in the area where they died.</p>
        <p>Steve Ostraff, associate director of the National Center for Infectious Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the birds were the first confirmed cases of the West Nile virus anywhere in the United States this year.</p>
        <p>Dr. Stone said that the confirmations were ''reason for concern,'' but that despite eradication efforts last fall and this spring, new cases of the virus had been expected to surface as mosquitoes proliferate with the arrival of warm weather. Mosquitoes act as a vector for the disease, picking up the virus from infected birds and transmitting it to other birds, and to humans, that they bite.</p>
        <p>The Rockland County executive, C. Scott Vanderhoff, issued a statement yesterday reminding residents that people and animals cannot contract the disease directly from birds. The county health commissioner, Gabriel R. Guardarramus, urged residents to use insect repellent, repair broken screens and avoid mosquito habitats,  especially after sunset.</p>
        <p>The disease control center is still reviewing New York State's test results, although federal health officials said they had no reason to doubt the state's confirmation.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of birds from 20 species died from the virus in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Maryland last year.</p>
        <p>Last summer's outbreak prompted widespread fear of the virus, and sweeping efforts by city, county and state health officials to monitor for the disease this year and to try to eradicate the mosquito population through treatment of breeding grounds with larvicide and public education campaigns.</p>
        <p>Officials hope to avoid the aerial spraying that was used last year, when the outbreak was discovered  late in the summer and many less-drastic methods of preventing mosquitoes from hatching would no longer have been effective.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's cases surfaced much earlier in the year than the first cases last year, but Dr. Ostraff cautioned against any inference that the disease may be more widespread this summer. ''Last year,'' he said,  ''nobody was looking for the virus.''</p>
