        <p>The Senate campaign of Hillary Rodham Clinton began broadcasting this 30-second television commercial yesterday.</p>
        <p>PRODUCERS -- Devito/Verdi, with Mandy Grunwald, the Washington media consultant, and Mark Penn, the Washington pollster.</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- In quick succession, the advertisement switches from pastoral scenes of farmland and a small-town Main Street in upstate New York to Mrs. Clinton conversing intently with a young family, embracing a retired couple and looking confidently into the camera by herself. In her solo sequence, the first lady, with a blue shawl around her shoulders, is seated at ease in what appears to be an office furnished in pastel tones, with a vase of fresh flowers behind her.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- ''In the last year, I've traveled to all 62 counties in New York. I believe it's important to tell you where I stand and what I'll do. I have a plan to bring high-tech jobs to every corner of New York. To help middle-class families deduct up to $10,000 a year in college costs. To help everyone get access to lower-cost prescription drugs. And let's be fiscally responsible. Save the surplus for Social Security and pay down the national debt. That's what I want to do if you put me to work for you.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- Mrs. Clinton fulfilled her widely publicized promise to campaign in every New York county in early May, and she continues to campaign extensively. The policy goals she spells out are highly simplified versions of positions she has articulated around the state, including a call for tax incentives to foster more widespread Internet access, her support for federal legislation to expand tuition tax deductions and her repeated attacks on import restrictions that allow United States prescription drugs to be sold at lower prices in Canada.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- The advertisement is most striking in its specificity. It appears calculated to lend credibility to a recent theme of Mrs. Clinton's campaign: that her opponent, Rick A. Lazio, is vague on the issues. While abbreviated to fit the constraints of a 30-second television spot, the ad touches more directly on a selection of policies than the first lady herself has ventured to do in some of her long campaign appearances. By emphasizing her travels around the state, the ad also offers a modest counterpunch to the energetic and widely publicized campaigning of Mr. Lazio.</p>
