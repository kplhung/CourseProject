        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>A June 4 letter writer depicts a grim picture for employees who take paternity or maternity leave. However, the fast-paced federal government office where I work as a lawyer immediately approved my request to take two months of paternity leave. I never feared being ridiculed, discriminated against or losing my job.</p>
