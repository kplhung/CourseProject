        <p>On a holy day of joy and celebration, an influential sect of ultra-Orthodox Jews in Brooklyn fell into a state of abject shock yesterday, their close-knit community stunned by news that their spiritual leader's granddaughter and her 5-month-old daughter had died in a predawn fire.</p>
        <p>The cause of yesterday's fire in a Williamsburg duplex only deepened the sadness. Officials said that the fire was an accident, touched off by religious candles that were lighted on Thursday to celebrate Shavuot, a major Jewish holiday that commemorates the day the Jewish people received the Ten Commandments from Moses.</p>
        <p>Sarah Blima Halberstam, 20, died with her arms wrapped around her baby, Chaya Esther Halberstam, the two of them only a few feet from the safety of a fire escape, fire officials said. Minutes before her death, several witnesses said, she had stood at a fourth-floor window crying out for help as she cradled Chaya against the gathering flames and smoke.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Halberstam, who lived in Montreal with her husband of two years, had come to Brooklyn to celebrate Shavuot with her grandfather, Grand Rabbi Moses Teitelbaum, whose followers in the Satmar sect are concentrated in the city's major Hasidic neighborhoods, Williamsburg and Borough Park.</p>
        <p>Rabbi Teitelbaum's followers, an estimated 50,000 in New York City alone, look upon him as their leader on questions of Jewish law.</p>
        <p>''In terms of status in the community, she comes from royal family,'' City Councilman Kenneth K. Fisher said of Mrs. Halberstam.</p>
        <p>In accordance with Jewish tradition, thousands of Satmar Jews gathered outside Rabbi Teitelbaum's synagogue yesterday afternoon for a funeral service. Men wearing embroidered prayer shawls climbed fences to get a glimpse at a minivan that carried two simple wood coffins draped in black cloth. Women, their heads covered in colorful scarves, pressed forward, too, straining against police barricades that kept them separate from the men.</p>
        <p>As the procession paused at the rear of the synagogue so that a frail and somber Rabbi Teitelbaum could join the mourners, dozens of young men jostled to press their faces to the minivan's windows. It was, they said, a gesture of respect on a day when Shavuot traditions prohibit speeches.</p>
        <p>''It's a tragic loss of a mother and a daughter that's beyond comprehension,'' Ernest Abraham, 52, said, his face reddened from the day's sweltering heat.</p>
        <p>The fire began shortly after 3 a.m. in an apartment at 78 Wilson Street. The apartment, which occupies the third and fourth floors of a brick duplex, is part of a housing complex used by faculty of the United Talmudic Academy, the central Satmar school authority.</p>
        <p>The academy and the faculty housing share the same city block as Rabbi Teitelbaum's residence and the site of the Satmars' unfinished 10,000-seat synagogue.</p>
        <p>Aside from Mrs. Halberstam and her daughter, three other women and four other children were inside the duplex when the fire broke out. One of the women was Rabbi Teitelbaum's 80-year-old wife, officials said. The other women were her daughters by blood or marriage.</p>
        <p>Their husbands -- and most of the other men from the neighborhood --  were several blocks away in the main synagogue on Rodney Street. The men were making their way through a book of Shavuot prayers and readings, a ritual that was to end at precisely 4:13 a.m.</p>
        <p>It was a festive occasion, a long night of prayer followed by a day of feasting, a day when children present their parents with flowers and parade about in their finest clothes.</p>
        <p>''This is one of the happiest holidays,'' said Yidel Perlstein, 23.</p>
        <p>With smoke filling the duplex and smoke detectors going off, most of the women and children made their escape through a rear patio that connected to a neighbor's patio, fire officials said.</p>
        <p>Fire Commissioner Thomas Von Essen said that more people might have been trapped except that one of the women had recently seen a television program that offered tips on how to survive a fire. ''She remembered how we tell people to know how to get out,'' he said, ''and she said she had made a mental note of the exit.''</p>
        <p>But somehow Mrs. Halberstam and her daughter became separated from the others. Mr. Von Essen said it was possible that Mrs. Halberstam became disoriented in unfamiliar surroundings.</p>
        <p>As scores of neighbors called 911 and the community's volunteer ambulance company, Hatzolah, Mrs. Halberstam was seen, briefly, standing at a fourth-floor window in her night clothes. Smoke was billowing from the windows, and she held her baby close to her chest, and then she disappeared back inside, witnesses said.</p>
        <p>''There was fire, screaming, it was chaos,'' recalled Morton Friedman, a  Hatzolah volunteer who was among the first to respond to the fire. ''The woman was yelling in Yiddish that she didn't know how to get out of the building.''</p>
        <p>By then, men were pouring out of local synagogues and following the smell of smoke and the sound of sirens toward the apartment. The first fire trucks arrived at about 3:40 p.m., and it took 47 minutes to bring the fire under control. Many in the crowd did not at first realize the severity of the situation, but as word spread that Mrs. Halberstam was trapped, some people began to pace about, frantically searching for something, anything, they could do to help.</p>
        <p>''She was found at the top of the steps, one room away from the back door,'' Mr. Von Essen said. ''She was holding the baby in her arms.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Von Essen said that 16 candles had been lighted to celebrate Shavuot. The fire, he said, seemed to center around those left burning on the kitchen stove on the third floor. Flames from the candles ignited nearby kitchen cabinets, and then the fire quickly spread throughout the rest of the kitchen.</p>
        <p>A few hours after yesterday afternoon's brief funeral service, the minivan carrying the coffins of Mrs. Halberstam and her daughter arrived in the village of Kiryas Joel, a Satmar enclave of 10,000 in the Hudson Valley. Some 700 Hasidic men and women were waiting, and they marched in long column to a synagogue, and from there to a cemetery.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Halberstam and her daughter were buried just yards away from the pale granite mausoleum of her great-great uncle, the late grand rabbi, Joel Teitelbaum.</p>
