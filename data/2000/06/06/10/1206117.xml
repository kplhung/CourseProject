        <p>Gov. George W. Bush today assailed Vice President Al Gore's signature effort to streamline government, saying the Clinton administration had not reinvented the bureaucracy, but ''simply reshuffled it.''</p>
        <p>Beginning the campaign day in Philadelphia at the Carpenter's Hall, the site of the First Continental Congress, Mr. Bush stepped squarely onto the territory of his opponent, who has overseen the administration's ''reinventing government program.''</p>
        <p>''Today, when Americans look to Washington, they see a government which is slow to respond, slow to reform, ignoring changes that are taking place in the private sector and in some local and state governments,'' Mr. Bush told a small crowd of invited guests.</p>
        <p>Ridiculing some management titles and duplicative government efforts, the Texas governor proposed plans for bringing government into the era of new technology, saying he would save $88 billion over five years by phasing out 40,000 management jobs, contracting out services to the private sector, and increasing use of the Internet.</p>
        <p>The speech was his second in two days concentrating on government operations, and today he had Mr. Gore directly in his sights. ''You may recall the present administration came to Washington promising to change all this -- to clear away the clutter of bureaucracy and to streamline the system,'' Mr. Bush said. ''At last report they had, in the vice president's words, created government that works better and costs less. That doesn't really square with the facts.''</p>
        <p>Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, campaigning at Mr. Bush's side, implicitly raised the questions about Mr. Clinton's character that are also at the heart of the Bush campaign. ''We need a president who people trust and we need a president who trusts the people,'' said Mr. Ridge, whose name has often appeared high on lists of potential running mates for Mr. Bush. Mr. Ridge even stole the slogan of the first Clinton campaign for president as he introduced Mr. Bush, saying, ''We need a president who puts people first.''</p>
        <p>With Mr. Gore at the helm, the Clinton administration began an effort to streamline the government in President Clinton's first year in office. So far, administration officials say, the government has saved about $136 billion through the effort.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore say the government work force is smaller than at any time since the early 1960's, with 377,000 fewer employees than when they came into office in 1993. The administration also says that changes in government procurement methods have saved more than $12 billion.</p>
        <p>''The federal government is smaller than it's been in 40 years and we've balanced the budget to boot,'' said Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for Mr. Gore. ''At the same time that we've made government smaller, we've invested more in education, health care and other ways to help people.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush challenged some of the administration's estimates of savings. He said that the independent General Accounting Office had been unable to document two-thirds of the savings.</p>
        <p>He mocked the federal government for having one safety agency that inspects cheese pizza, and another that inspects pepperoni pizza, saying: ''Apparently the revolutionary idea that maybe these functions should be combined hasn't dawned on anybody yet.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush made fun of the titles of some senior federal administrators. ''We now have Washington offices crowded with people bearing titles like associate principal deputy assistant secretary, or principal deputy to the deputy assistant secretary,'' he said to a ripple of laughter.</p>
        <p>''The point is that for all the administration's rhetoric about reinvention, they never asked the fundamental question about the purpose of government,'' Mr. Bush said, ''what it's doing or whether it should be doing it at all. At a time when private businesses are turning to leaner management teams, Washington keeps adding new managers. They haven't reinvented the government bureaucracy; they have simply reshuffled it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said he would not replace half of the managers at senior and middle levels who are expected to retire over the next eight years -- eliminating 40,000 jobs. He called on Congress to create a ''sunset review board'' to evaluate every government program and agency ''to make sure it has not outlived its usefulness.''</p>
        <p>He outlined an array of other changes, like moving government procurement to the Internet and creating a chief information officer, and spending $100 million to promote e-commerce proposals.</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign responded by pointing to Texas, saying that since Mr. Bush took office in 1995, the Texas budget has grown to $98.1 billion from $72.8 billion, or by 36 percent, compared with 21 percent federally.</p>
        <p>Later in the day, Mr. Bush stumped before an enthusiastic crowd at a high-tech company here in Connecticut, the Silicon Valley Group Lithography Systems, and attended fund-raisers that aides said would generate nearly $2 million for Republican campaigns.</p>
