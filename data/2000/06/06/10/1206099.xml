        <p>Don Henley assumed an unusual stance for a rock star during his show on Thursday at Radio City Music Hall. For much of the performance this singer and songwriter stood with an almost military erectness, his feet aligned and his chest puffed.</p>
        <p>This probably helped him exploit his tenor to its full capacity. It also complemented his persona, for Mr. Henley is a poet of no fun, rock's spokesperson for the chronically uptight. As a leader of the 1970's superstar band the Eagles, Mr. Henley was the voice of that decadent era's hangover. ''We are all just prisoners here of our own device,'' he sang in the band's epic ''Hotel California,'' which he reprised on Thursday in an inventive Latin-kitsch arrangement replete with a four-piece trombone section.</p>

        <p>Don Henley assumed an unusual stance for a rock star during his show on Thursday at Radio City Music Hall. For much of the performance this singer and songwriter stood with an almost military erectness, his feet aligned and his chest puffed.</p>
        <p>This probably helped him exploit his tenor to its full capacity. It also complemented his persona, for Mr. Henley is a poet of no fun, rock's spokesperson for the chronically uptight. As a leader of the 1970's superstar band the Eagles, Mr. Henley was the voice of that decadent era's hangover. ''We are all just prisoners here of our own device,'' he sang in the band's epic ''Hotel California,'' which he reprised on Thursday in an inventive Latin-kitsch arrangement replete with a four-piece trombone section.</p>
        <p>The gleeful reworking didn't belie the song's basic pessimism, which was affirmed by the night's other Eagles songs: the beautifully spare ''Desperado''; ''Life in the Fast Lane,'' badly mangled in a new version that made fun of rap; and ''The Long Run,'' a happy boogie about two tired hedonists who give up their adventures for each other.</p>
        <p>Trading liberation for creature comforts has been the theme of Mr. Henley's career. His exquisite sense of disappointment keeps him a favorite among former party animals who settled down on schedule and sometimes wonder why.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, Thursday's audience seemed out of practice. Most fans remained glued to their seats until the end, then, upon Mr. Henley's instruction to dance, bolted upright as if they'd just remembered they were at a rock concert.</p>
        <p>Leading a seven-piece band intermittently augmented by horn players, a gospel choir, and an Irish whistle and uillean pipes player, Mr. Henley laid out the tense sound that complements his rueful lyrics. It shows the influence of his peers Bruce Springsteen, Billy Joel and John Fogerty, but is distinctively hot and cold, like dry ice. He has polished the sometimes rustic, country-tinged sound of the Eagles while preserving its easiness, which, given his lyrics about middle-class self-entrapment, has come to represent inertia instead of release.</p>
        <p>It all comes back to his voice, which gains power from constriction. He sounded impossibly annoyed when he rocked out, and doleful when he slowed down. Technically he's a beautiful singer. The falsetto notes he hit during the new ''Everything Is Different'' were magnificent. Yet while other soul men use their chops to embody liberation, Mr. Henley has made prayers of regret.</p>
        <p>In 1980's hits like ''Boys of Summer'' and ''End of the Innocence,'' pensively performed on Thursday, Mr. Henley spoke for yuppies who had lost their spark. This is one Henley stance: empathy for the self-absorbed. Yet in political music, like ''Goodbye to a River,'' a new environmental protest seemingly inspired by the standard ''Cry Me a River,'' he aims to shake the very complacency his other songs go inside.</p>
        <p>This paradox has led his critics to scorn Mr. Henley as a self-righteous hypocrite. It is easier to believe the satisfaction he expresses on his new album, ''Inside Job,'' (Warner Brothers), which celebrates his recent marriage and fatherhood, than to accept him as a protest singer, even though that's his more interesting stance.</p>
        <p>There's no denying Mr. Henley's activism; from membership on the boards of several environmental groups to his recent protests against copyright laws that limit artists' rights of ownership, this man loves making a statement. His credibility problem is inevitable, though, and not only because he railed against today's rampant greed in the new song ''Workin' It'' at a concert with sky-high ticket prices, sponsored by Mercedes-Benz.</p>
        <p>He has simply been too good for too long at exposing the dark thoughts of the world's haves to stand up convincingly for have-nots, be they cheated artists or endangered waterways. The desperadoes of Mr. Henley's songs ride expensive mounts, and he has made a distinctive contribution to rock by sharing the view from that perch. Others speak more eloquently from the cold, hard ground.</p>
