        <p>Marilyn Crispell's piano playing has changed quite a bit since she first appeared in the early 80's. For the most part she has moved in the direction of romanticism and greater structure, and she seems to keep the stations of that journey within herself.</p>
        <p>Her set on Thursday night at the Knitting Factory, part of the Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival, with a trio that was making its American debut, ran through a number of styles; the one element shared by almost every piece was the feeling of the ballad.</p>
        <p>She has worked with the bassist Gary Peacock and the drummer Paul Motian on a recent recording, ''Nothing Ever Was, Anyway'' (ECM/BMG), and on European stages. Mr. Peacock and Mr. Motian have a connection that goes back to the early 60's, when they accompanied Bill Evans; they're used to the notion that a piano trio is a three-way intersection rather than a system of accompaniment in the bass and drums holding the pianist aloft.</p>
        <p>What they do for Ms. Crispell is a slightly more deconstructed version of what they have recently sounded like with the pianist Paul Bley. While Mr. Peacock emphatically slides notes and gives them a muscular vibrato, questioning the absolutism of pitch, Mr. Motian spin webs of melodic percussion; his playing rolls along delicately, almost never falling into patterns that last for longer than one bar. When he broke into a standard bebop pattern on the snare drum for a few seconds, the audience laughed at the concreteness of the gesture.</p>
        <p>This diffuse, vaporized rhythm is Ms. Crispell's element. Her playing has little sharpness. She follows melodies tenaciously or creates them, sometimes doubling them up by playing parallel figures with her hands. Her notes dip below the surface of audibility and then swell up again with the help of the sustain pedal. In a few pieces, with her left hand fixed in a droning chord and her right reformulating the notes of a rhapsodic melody, the music came close to the arty pop vocabulary of Tori Amos; at other times there was a strong hint of Mr. Bley's down-home themes played in eccentric time.</p>
        <p>There was also a ballad with harmonies that were recognizably from the jazz tradition, and for an encore, a short, highly improvised skirmish among the three musicians that ended on the band's highest energy level.</p>
