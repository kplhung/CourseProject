        <p>Kobe Bryant was helped from the court, his left ankle swollen. Shaquille O'Neal pushed line drives toward the rim, his free-throw woes building with each successive misfire.</p>
        <p>The Los Angeles Lakers were vulnerable tonight, their pursuit of a championship stalled by misfortune and misfires. Yet O'Neal would not let 21 missed free throws bother him. He responded like his teammates in Bryant's absence, making the ones that mattered in a 111-104 victory over the Indiana Pacers that gave the Lakers a 2-0 lead in the four-of-seven-game National Basketball Association finals. The series will shift to Indiana for Game 3 on Sunday night.</p>
        <p>''With Shaq at the line and Kobe going down, we had a golden opportunity tonight that slipped through our fingers,'' Reggie Miller said. ''What can you say? A guy goes back-to-back 40, you got to give him credit.''</p>
        <p>Battling the Hack-a-Shaq defense that allowed him take an N.B.A. finals record 39 free throws, O'Neal made 18 and finished with 40 points, 24 rebounds, 4 assists and 3 blocked shots. He made 9 of 16 from the line in the fourth period, 12 minutes that took 48 because of the stoppage in play.</p>
        <p>Coming off a 43-point demolition of Indiana in Game 1, he again saved his most scintillating play for the end. When the Pacers crept to within 99-96 with less than a minute left, he received the ball in the middle of the lane. Before Sam Perkins could foul him, he turned and zinged a pass to a cutting Robert Horry under the basket. Horry completed a reverse layup, was fouled and made the free throw for a 102-96 lead with 58.8 seconds left.</p>
        <p>''When Kobe went out, we felt like we had to pick it up,'' O'Neal said. ''I thought my guys did.''</p>
        <p>Ron Harper made 8 of 12 shots and finished with 21 points and Glen Rice added 21, too, hitting 5 of 6 3-pointers to compensate for the loss of Bryant.</p>
        <p>Jalen Rose's 30 points led Indiana. Miller rebounded from his 1-for-16 bad dream in Game 1, finishing with 21 points on 7 of 16 shooting. But with the Pacers in need of his marksmanship, he did not attempt a field goal in the fourth quarter until less than 6 minutes remained.</p>
        <p>Bryant, who went down in the first quarter, attended the postgame news conference on crutches. He is not expected to play in Game 3.</p>
        <p>''I've had sprained ankles before, so I thought I was just going to get up and play,'' he said. ''But the more I tried to get up, the more it hurt worse and worse.''</p>
        <p>After hitting a 17-foot jump shot over Rose, Bryant fell awkwardly to the floor with 3 minutes 26 seconds left. He rolled his left ankle on Rose's foot while coming down after releasing the shot.</p>
        <p>Helped to the locker room, he was told that he had a moderately sprained ankle after X-rays came up negative. Listed as day to day, Bryant was ruled questionable for Game 3.</p>
        <p>Bryant injured the same ankle in Game 5 of the Western Conference finals, but returned in time for Game 6. He had been undergoing therapy for the injury since last week, using range-of-motion exercises to increase flexibility.</p>
        <p>Coach Larry Bird said he would not employ the Hack-a-Shaq defense, in which O'Neal is repeatedly fouled to increase possessions for the opposing team and free-throw misses for the Lakers.</p>
        <p>But with the game in the balance, Bird resorted to the same strategy used by Portland in the Western finals. Other than whether O'Neal would miss badly or sink the shot, it made for awful theater. But it did stop the clock and give the Pacers a chance.</p>
        <p>''I don't worry about ratings now,'' Bird said. ''I'm just trying to win a ballgame. And I'm going to do whatever I have to do.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''I thought he played better tonight than he did the other night. Sometimes, 2 or 3 guys can't stop him. He's awesome. He's a dominating player. It's hard to match up against him.''</p>
        <p>O'Neal had help. Rik Smits again played poorly. He picked up his fifth foul with 7:09 left in the third quarter and made only 2 of 6 shots. Unable to stop O'Neal on defense or at least make him guard him from the perimeter on offense, Smits is hurting Indiana like no other player.</p>
        <p>Indeed, if the Lakers were resilient, the Pacers were not up to the challenge. Miller had an open look at a 3-pointer to cut the deficit to 2 with less than 3 minutes left, but he could not connect.</p>
        <p>Without Bryant, role players such as Rice and Harper shouldered the scoring load and played as if they were the key components to the triangle offense.</p>
        <p>O'Neal was so strong and forceful, not even the officiating crew could fathom his power and agility. With less than 7 minutes left, he appeared to cleanly block a driving layup by Travis Best, who used his forearm to initiate contact.</p>
        <p>But the referee Eddie F. Rush somehow called a flagrant foul on O'Neal, which had the Laker bench up in anger. ''I don't understand the rules when a little sports car runs into a big truck,'' he said. ''But I'm a big guy. I can take it.''</p>
        <p>The Lakers withstood every Pacer run, finally putting the game away midway through the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>Miller found his rhythm on offense, making 7 of 14 shots through three quarters and consistently keeping the Pacers in the game with a timely jump shot. But with 6:40 left in the game, he had yet to attempt a shot in the fourth period.</p>
