        <p>THERE comes a moment in every diva's life when Europe's opera houses do not satisfy. It is no longer enough to have triumphed at the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden or at the  State Opera House in Vienna. The audiences in Paris bore her. She is not even thrilled by the cheers from the notoriously difficult Milanese at La Scala.</p>
        <p>No, she wants more. She looks across the Atlantic Ocean. She sets her sights on that pinnacle of culture -- the District of Columbia! She resolves to sing on the fabled stage of -- the second-biggest auditorium at the Kennedy Center!</p>
        <p>You may not be familiar with this particular dream, but that is only because you are not a member of the United States Congress. This week, the House of Representatives and the Senate both voted to designate the Washington Opera company as the National Opera.</p>
        <p>It's hard to decide whether New Yorkers should be insulted by the effrontery or amused at the absurdity. Our second-string company, the City Opera, has a bigger budget and a better reputation than the Washington Opera. Then, of course, there is the Metropolitan Opera, which today is widely regarded as the pre-eminent company not only in America but also in the world.</p>
        <p>''The Metropolitan Opera is considered by every opera lover in the world as the national company of the United States,'' said Joseph Volpe, the general manager of the Met. ''These votes seem to show that the members of Congress are not very astute about opera.''</p>
        <p>Brian Kellow, the executive editor of Opera News, said that his publication is in no danger of moving from New York to the new opera capital.</p>
        <p>''When we sit down to plan our coverage for the season,'' he said, ''the Washington Opera is not one of the first companies that comes to mind. And Washington certainly doesn't have a reputation as an opera town. New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle, Los Angeles, Houston, St. Louis; there are a lot of places I would put in line ahead of Washington. It's presumptuous to call it the National Opera.''</p>
        <p>The Washington company's chief claim to fame has been the hiring of a Met star, Placido Domingo, as its artistic director. Whatever they're paying him -- given his busy schedule at the Met and other houses, he can't be putting in too many hours down there -- he earned his pieces of silver this week by allowing himself to be quoted in the company's press release.</p>
        <p>''I am thrilled that the new designation of our company reflects the fact that it is in the nation's capital, and therefore belongs to a wide, national audience,'' Mr. Domingo said.</p>
        <p>Citing the national companies in Berlin, Vienna, London and Amsterdam, he added, ''European opera companies, in cities where the government functions, have often reflected that fact in their titles.''</p>
        <p>But this is not Europe. Our political capital is not our cultural capital, and it's false advertising to pretend that Washington's company resembles the ones in Europe. Like the decision to designate a Baltimore tourist attraction as the National Aquarium, it's just a way for Congress to pander to local boosters.</p>
        <p>EVEN the hometown paper seems a little embarrassed by the designation. The Washington Post, noting that ''only New York's Metropolitan Opera could rightly be considered a national opera company,'' pointed this week to other local institutions that have not lived up to their names, like the National Theater and an obscure suburban troupe in Bowie, Md., calling itself the National Ballet.</p>
        <p>Maybe, though, these name games serve some purpose. They're an indirect reminder of New York's great cultural blessing: it is not a political capital. It has surpassed the old cultural centers in Europe because its artists and performers and writers don't rely on politicians for money or on national institutions for prestige.</p>
        <p>Unlike Europe's opera houses, which are heavily subsidized by national governments, the Metropolitan Opera gets nearly all its revenue, 99.66 percent, from ticket sales and other private sources. It has been flourishing artistically while European companies have struggled with chronic political battles, labor disputes and varieties of mismanagement.</p>
        <p>In the long run, an opera company is better off trying to please customers and patrons, instead of currying favor with politicians. So perhaps New Yorkers shouldn't begrudge Washingtonians' triumph in Congress this week. Yes, they now have the National Opera. But they're the ones who have to listen to it.</p>
