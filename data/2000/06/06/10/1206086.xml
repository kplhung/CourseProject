        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Gore Vows to Overhaul Child Support System'' (news article, June 3): Perhaps one way to bolster Al Gore's suggestion that fathers who owe child support be required to support their children would be to understand and remedy the reasons that they don't.</p>
        <p>In my professional experience, some men, for example, equate their paying child support with their right to spend time with their children. Others express concern that their child support will be spent by the mother ''on herself'' rather than on the children.</p>
        <p>Correcting such erroneous views would empower men to be responsible for their children without necessity of governmental threat.</p>
