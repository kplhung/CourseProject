        <p>Margot Livesey's new novel, ''The Missing World,'' begins on a tantalizing note. After being struck by a car in London, Hazel Ransome loses her memory, but only for the three years immediately preceding the accident. During that period, she has broken up with her boyfriend. He takes Hazel's amnesia as an opportunity to pretend that he never betrayed her.</p>
        <p>From there, the characters are led into an intricate story about the elusiveness of memory. In the book, Ms. Livesey circles Santayana's statement that ''those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it,'' and its correlative, ''only forgetfulness sets us free.''</p>
        <p>In a recent interview, Ms. Livesey said, ''Writing a novel about amnesia in the age of the memoir has a certain appeal.'' After her exploration of the subject, she concluded,  ''There are different kinds of memories, not simply the verbal kind we tend to lay claim to, but those that are buried in our emotions, somewhere deep in our hippocampus, that come out in spite of ourselves.''</p>
        <p>As always, before beginning a book she immersed herself in research, starting with St. Augustine: ''Many of our ways of thinking about memory had their origins in the 'Confessions.' St. Augustine was the one who set up the idea that memory was this great storehouse, and that nothing was ever lost. How interesting that those metaphors persisted over 15 centuries.''</p>
        <p>In her fiction, Ms. Livesey, a 46-year-old Scottish novelist, illuminates the twists and turns of chance and circumstance, ''the fault lines'' that can determine the future. In ''Criminals'' (1996), a London banker on his way to visit his sister in Scotland finds a baby abandoned in a men's room in a bus station, and that begins a string of troubling events.</p>
        <p>In ''The Missing World,'' Hazel's amnesia becomes the lightning rod for an ensemble of oddly matched, eccentric people. They include an absent-minded actress who thinks of life as theater, and a well-educated American man who becomes a roofer in London and has a passion for helping other people. Several of them are concealing personal secrets.</p>
        <p>Asked if she would like to emulate her heroine and wipe out several years in her life, Ms. Livesey said: ''I'm the opposite of Edith Piaf. I regret everything. There are so many things I would like to do over.'' She added, ''In writing the novel, I became more convinced of the virtues of amnesia.'' As she sees it, chance has played a pivotal role in her own life, beginning with her birth in a remote Scottish town and her mother's death when she was 2 1/2 years old. ''That definitively shaped who I am,'' she said, leaving her with a feeling ''of being slightly outside things.'' She was brought up by her father and her stepmother, who were both 55 when she was 5, and by a neighboring family that had four children of its own. An only child, Ms. Livesey has no living relatives.</p>
        <p>Her sense of dislocation is underscored by living ''between two countries'' as what she calls ''a kind of migrant worker.'' During the academic year she is in Cambridge, Mass., and teaches writing at Emerson College in Boston; she spends summers in her house in London and frequently returns to Scotland.</p>
        <p>Despite its English setting, ''The Missing World'' is, she said, ''in some ways, a very American novel, because America is the land of second chances, where people come to reinvent themselves.''</p>
        <p>A year after graduating from the University of York, she began writing. Moving to Canada with her boyfriend, she held a variety of jobs, many them menial. While working as a waitress, she studied with the novelist Brian Moore at the University of Toronto. Soon her stories were being printed in small Canadian magazines. Eventually she sent them to an editor who said she would like to publish them in a book but would need 100 more pages. In response, Ms. Livesey wrote ''Learning by Heart,'' a novella that gave the title to the collection.</p>
        <p>''Learning by Heart'' was about her stepmother and the ''quite vexed relationship we had when I was growing up.'' For her first novel, ''Homework,'' in 1990, she turned the earlier story on its head and wrote about a young girl who behaves monstrously toward her father's girlfriend. ''That inversion was crucial to my progress as a fiction writer,'' she said, ''learning to look at something from another point of view than the one I would naturally adopt.'' Since then, her work has been prismatic, with stories told from different, often contradictory perspectives.</p>
        <p>Because of that and her titles, her books have occasionally been wrongly classified as mysteries. ''I certainly don't see myself as a mystery writer,'' she said. Then to define her work, she said, ''I think I try to recreate entertaining surfaces to look at dark matters.''</p>
        <p>''The Missing World'' was inspired by a magazine article and by a passing acquaintance with someone who had experienced a memory loss. Then she let her imagination roam. Although her novels seem straightforward, she regards them as ''sneakily experimental'' and, in admiration, quotes William Trevor as saying that he thought of himself as an experimental writer ''but that all the experiments are hidden.''</p>
        <p>In ''Criminals,'' there is a novel within the novel, a book called ''The Dark Forest,'' written by one of the characters. Reading that book, another character says that novels are ''to fend off the dark night of the soul or at least offer solace in the night.'' Ms. Livesey agreed with that assessment: ''Traditionally, when the novel was first coming into being in the 18th century, part of the pleasure was reading about invented characters and imagining that those characters could contain the reader.''</p>
        <p>She often reviews fiction, sometimes in The New York Times Book Review. In one review she quoted Henry James as saying that ''some of our greatest artists are those who have managed to combine the artificial and the real.''</p>
        <p>''There's something very satisfying about the shapeliness of art,'' she said, ''but if things are too shapely they're in danger of feeling rarefied. We also need that hurly-burly, jostling quality of life on the page. I guess I aspire to both.''</p>
        <p>Recently she was asked to contribute to a collection of essays by writers about movies of their choice. She chose ''I Know Where I'm Going,'' the classic Michael Powell romance starring Wendy Hiller and the actor Roger Livesey (as a Scottish lord of a distant island). The two Liveseys are not related. This is one of her favorite films and just talking about it evoked memories of her birthplace.</p>
        <p>''When I go north of the border and climb the hills, my heart rises,'' Ms. Livesey said. ''The landscape remains rooted in my imagination. I feel I understand the texture of life there in a deeper way than I do in other places. There is a kind of beleaguered romance to Scotland. Where I grew up, you could look at the hills and you could say, there's the cave where Bonnie Prince Charlie hid when he was in flight.''</p>
        <p>''History is buried in the land,'' she said. ''That played a part in my thinking about memory.''</p>
