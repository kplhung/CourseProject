        <p>The thousands of angry drivers who spent hours in their cars waiting to get through New Jersey's new auto emissions test last winter were told why today: senior state officials had been  warned that the system would not work but concealed that information from their superiors and had the system installed anyway.</p>
        <p>This conclusion was part of a report released today by a three-member panel that was charged by Gov. Christine Todd Whitman in January with finding out why the $500 million testing system failed so spectacularly from its inception in December to its suspension a month later, creating a vexing political problem for the governor.</p>
        <p>Reacting to the report, Governor Whitman announced today that three state officials had resigned or had been disciplined, including C. Richard Kamin, who was removed as director of the State Division of Motor Vehicles and offered another post within its parent, the Department of Transportation.</p>
        <p>But the governor's office, if not specifically Mrs. Whitman herself, was also faulted in the panel's report for not staying on top of what is arguably the most important public works project undertaken by the Whitman administration, and certainly one of its most politically sensitive.</p>
        <p>As everyone in the State House is aware, the Division of Motor Vehicles is one of the few state agencies that residents come into direct contact with regularly, and the governor has made it a policy to improve the public's experiences there.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman put most of the blame today on Parsons Infrastructure and Technology Group, the California company that the state hired in 1998 to run its 32 centralized testing stations. The company is still trying to make the system work after computer failures, equipment breakdowns, long waiting times and some drivers' complaints that the equipment damaged their cars.</p>
        <p>But Democratic leaders in the Legislature accused the governor of trying to hide her own failure to manage the project.</p>
        <p>The investigating panel, led by former Justice Alan B. Handler of the State Supreme Court, found that Parsons had not adequately tested the technology used in the testing stations and that state officials had ignored warnings from a consulting firm hired to oversee the project that the equipment was likely to break down.</p>
        <p>The state's project manager, Carl Passeri, repeatedly sided with Parsons against the consulting firm's warnings, and eventually limited the consultants' role, the report said.</p>
        <p>Governor Whitman announced today that Mr. Passeri resigned last week and that Mr. Kamin had been removed as head of the Division of Motor Vehicles. A third official, John Elston, administrator of the Department of Environmental Protection's Air Planning Office, was reprimanded.</p>
        <p>New Jersey began the more stringent testing in December after the federal Environmental Protection Agency threatened to withhold $1 billion in highway funds unless the state improved its air quality.</p>
        <p>But as the new report points out, and as Justice Handler emphasized in an interview today, the governor and everyone in her administration got an early warning of problems with the system late last fall, when the inspection station in Edison opened for a dry run of the system. Breakdowns in the test produced howls of complaints from drivers about long lines, and newspaper headlines about the failure of the long-awaited emissions program.</p>
        <p>''It is a fact that they saw newspaper accounts that were pretty specific at the prospects of failure,'' Justice Handler said, referring to the governor's cabinet-level advisers. ''And it is also a fact that those warnings were not heeded. One can only infer that they felt that the newspaper accounts were not accurate in view of the reports they were getting from their own people. But our report does indicate that in light of the newspaper accounts, the overall supervision should have been much more focused.''</p>
        <p>The governor, in a statement, placed most of the blame on Parsons.  ''The panel found that Parsons failed to meet its obligations and that the record of their performance is replete with missed deadlines and broken promises,'' she said.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Mrs. Whitman seemed to soften the blow on her subordinates by suggesting that whatever their failures, they were motivated by a desire to get the job done.</p>
        <p>''The report finds,'' Mrs. Whitman went on, ''that senior project managers, driven by a zeal to meet a federal deadline and to avoid the potential loss of hundreds of millions of federal highway dollars, failed in their responsibility to supervise the implementation of this massive program.''</p>
        <p>Democrats in the Legislature accused the governor of whitewashing her own responsibility. The Parsons contract has long been unpopular with the Democrats, who maintain that it was politically tainted. Parsons, the only company to bid on the project, had close ties to several well-connected Republicans and gave Carl Golden, Mrs. Whitman's former communications director, a multimillion-dollar contract to represent the company in the State House as a lobbyist.</p>
        <p>The Democrats are particularly angry that Parsons continues to operate the state's old testing program while it tries to bring the new system up to working order. After last winter's fiasco, the E.P.A. allowed the state and the company to revert to previous testing methods until June 30, when the new testing would resume. But the new system is not ready, and the agency agreed this week to extend the deadline to Aug. 1.</p>
        <p>''Who has been punished?'' said Assemblyman Neil Cohen of Union County, the deputy minority leader.  ''Parsons still has not delivered a working test site, yet they continue to take in their profits, while Dick Kamin and the others are reading about their humiliation in the papers and being asked to commit voluntary career suicide.''</p>
        <p>The Handler report -- in nine volumes, weighing 33 pounds -- was delivered to the governor on Thursday. In includes the testimony of 27 witnesses, including Michael Torpey, the governor's chief of staff, and the commissioners of transportation and environmental protection. Kenneth E. Merin, a former state insurance commissioner, and Walter F. Timpone, a former assistant United States attorney, also sat on the panel.</p>
        <p>The report sums up its findings in these five major conclusions:</p>
        <p>*State officials were so concerned about meeting a Dec. 13, 1999, federal deadline for the emissions testing that they developed ''a tunnel vision that hampered senior project managers from objectively and appropriately managing the project.''</p>
        <p>*State officials did not enforce contract agreements with Parsons, repeatedly allowing the company ''to extend deadlines and defer elements of the program that were required under the contract.''</p>
        <p>*Midlevel officials withheld from their superiors the bad news that the system would not be ready on time.</p>
        <p>*The transportation commissioner, James Weinstein, and the commissioner of environmental protection, Robert Shinn, did not effectively supervise the project. ''Their ineffective supervision, particularly after reports and warning of defects in the system were reported in the press, contributed to their lack of information about serious deficiencies in the system and their inability to take corrective action,'' the report said.</p>
        <p>*The governor's office ''did not effectively monitor the progress'' of the project.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the state Commission of Investigation is looking into whether Parsons complied with its contract, a spokesman for the governor said today.</p>
