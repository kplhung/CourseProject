        <p>After an hourlong ride in a speedboat up the choppy Columbia River, Vice President Al Gore today announced President Clinton's designation of the Hanford Reach in south-central Washington, one of the most important salmon-spawning beds in the world, as a national monument.</p>
        <p>The designation provides protection from dams, dredging and development for 195,000 acres of public land along the river, including the point, which a jeans-clad, wind-blown Mr. Gore examined by boat today, where more than 80 percent of fall chinook salmon spawn.</p>

        <p>After an hourlong ride in a speedboat up the choppy Columbia River, Vice President Al Gore today announced President Clinton's designation of the Hanford Reach in south-central Washington, one of the most important salmon-spawning beds in the world, as a national monument.</p>
        <p>The designation provides protection from dams, dredging and development for 195,000 acres of public land along the river, including the point, which a jeans-clad, wind-blown Mr. Gore examined by boat today, where more than 80 percent of fall chinook salmon spawn.</p>
        <p>The new monument surrounds a region that, paradoxically, was already protected -- for other purposes -- by the federal government as part of the Army's secret Manhattan Project, which designed and built the atomic bomb in World War II. The plutonium for the bomb that the United States dropped on Nagasaki, Japan, in 1945 was made at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation near here. The nuclear reactors and their adjacent burial grounds of high-level radioactive waste are excluded from the national monument boundary.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Gore told a small crowd today along the banks of the Columbia here, ''It is a great irony of our history that in closing off these lands to build great weapons of destruction in service to the cause of freedom, at the same time we actually ended up protecting one of our greatest natural treasures.''</p>
        <p>''And let me tell you,'' he added, ''I am committed to making sure that we continue to clean up the cold war legacy of contamination on this land.''</p>
        <p>The lands, under various federal and state orders, are to be cleaned up by 2070. But there is fierce opposition to this move, both from local governments that want to keep control of the area and agricultural interests that want to use the river to irrigate farms.</p>
        <p>Representative Richard Hastings, a Republican who represents this area, which has been a buffer zone between the contamination and the community, wrote to the president recently asking him not to make the designation. Mr. Hastings said there was no immediate threat to the river because of a federal law that bans new dams and navigational projects on this part of the river.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton actually signed the proclamation designating the Hanford Reach and three other areas -- the Ironwood Forest in Arizona, the Canyons of the Ancients in Colorado and Cascade-Siskiyou in Oregon -- as national monuments this morning in Washington.</p>
        <p>Aides to Mr. Gore said the president's action relieved the vice president of any official obligation here and allowed him to stage the announcement as a campaign event.</p>
