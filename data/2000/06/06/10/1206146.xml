        <p>Whether Microsoft wins or loses its appeal of the antitrust ruling that could break the company in two, its world has changed, perhaps forever.</p>

        <p>Whether Microsoft wins or loses its appeal of the antitrust ruling that could break the company in two, its world has changed, perhaps forever.</p>
        <p>Some of the changes are linked to a growing belief that close government scrutiny has made it more difficult for Microsoft, based in nearby Redmond, Wash., to flex its industry muscle. Others are linked to the rapid emergence of new consumer markets, ranging from hand-held computing to digital delivery of audio and video, where the industry standards established by Microsoft software and Intel hardware may offer no advantage.</p>
        <p>Indeed, with almost breathtaking speed, a company long viewed as a colossus astride the computer industry is increasingly perceived as a Gulliver, with tribulations that include a courtroom defeat, a swooning stock and defecting employees.</p>
        <p>''Every headhunter in Silicon Valley must be on the phone today to Microsoft's employees telling them, 'Now's the time,' '' said David Yoffie, a Harvard Business School professor and computer industry consultant.</p>
        <p>Microsoft officials say the changed industry perception of the company is in fact the most threatening and damaging consequences of the entire antitrust proceeding.</p>
        <p>''We used to be viewed as invincible, and now we're not,'' said one of the company's top executives, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified. ''That was one of our most valuable assets, and now it's gone.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, the new perception of Microsoft's declining power is one that its chief executive, Steven A. Ballmer, acknowledged was curious.</p>
        <p>''I don't think the world changed,'' he said. ''It is ironic, in a certain sense, that at a time when the press is writing about the fact that we are more vulnerable competitively, there's this ruling that stems from the fact that we are too strong.''</p>
        <p>It is a period that mirrors the end of the era of I.B.M.'s greatest power, which stretched well into the 1980's and was exemplified by the slogan ''No one was ever fired for buying I.B.M.''</p>
        <p>It is also a turn of events that Microsoft's co-founder, William H. Gates, has been fond of foretelling, though not entirely in the way that he described it. During the trial Mr. Gates would frequently note that Microsoft's power and influence could disappear at a moment's notice at the hands of some upstart technology that could not be foreseen.</p>
        <p>The decline of Microsoft's influence has also created new challenges for Microsoft's most bitter competitors, which have long argued that the software giant's monopoly on the personal computer operating system gave it special abilities to harm its rivals.</p>
        <p>Scott McNealy, the chairman of Sun Microsystems, a Microsoft rival, said in an interview this week that he believed that the balance of power in the computing world was changing.</p>
        <p>He cited two recent events to support his contention: an announcement in February that Gateway, a major Microsoft customer, would offer a free package of Sun software products with some computers, and an appearance by Apple Computer's chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, on stage with Mr. McNealy at a Sun conference in San Francisco this week. Microsoft is an investor in Apple, and its Office programs are vital to many Apple users.</p>
        <p>''I don't think this would have happened'' before the antitrust trial, said Mr. McNealy, an outspoken Microsoft antagonist.</p>
        <p>Indeed, less than three years ago, Microsoft's power was such that a Gateway plan to reduce the prominence of the Windows branding on some computers ran aground, according to several people who took part in the project. They said the effort was canceled after Microsoft threatened to impose tougher licensing terms on the company.</p>
        <p>But last month Gateway was sufficiently emboldened to announce that it would bring to market a tablet-sized Internet appliance using neither Microsoft's software nor Intel's processor.</p>
        <p>Not everyone in the industry considers Microsoft a hobbled giant. Some hold that the industry's fundamental power structure and the revenue-generating capacity of Microsoft's desktop operating system monopoly have not yet been curbed, either by competitors like the free Linux operating system or by government regulators.</p>
        <p>Gateway's decision to choose a processor from the Transmeta Corporation, a Silicon Valley start-up company, and to use the Linux operating system for its new Internet appliance represents less than a fundamental change, the skeptics say.</p>
        <p>''It's like General Motors pointing to International Harvester's decision to pick a Cummins diesel engine and saying, 'See, we're not a monopolist,' '' said Richard Doherty, president of Envisioneering, a computer-industry consulting firm based in Seaford, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Yet even some executives inside Microsoft say that employee morale has already suffered, posing a critical threat to a company whose lifeblood is the skill and passion of its smartest programmers. There has been a stream of departures by executives and other important employees over the last year.</p>
        <p>''Of the 34,000 employees at Microsoft, there are 5,000 who really count,'' a top company executive said. ''Of those brightest employees, a third are demoralized.''</p>
        <p>Moving to reassure its troops, the company released a new issue of employee stock options in late April, when the government's breakup proposal was looming and the share price had declined by almost 50 percent in four months. But many employees are still less well off, at least on paper, than they were last year.</p>
        <p>''Their most critical problem is, how do you keep those people?'' Mr. Yoffie said.</p>
        <p>The recent adversity comes at a crucial juncture for Microsoft, which is moving on several fronts to address challenges or exploit opportunities outside the domain it has dominated: software running on the hard drive of a personal computer.</p>
        <p>For hand-held devices, where Palm Inc. has emerged as the industry leader, Microsoft two months ago introduced a new version of its Windows CE operating system. It also said it would take on Sony, Nintendo and Sega Enterprises in the video game business next year with a machine it has dubbed the X-Box. It is also trying to challenge the companies that have traditionally dominated corporate computing markets, like Sun and I.B.M., with a new version of its Windows NT operating system, called Windows 2000.</p>
        <p>Finally, on June 22, it will introduce an effort to integrate a wide variety of Internet services into its operating-system strategy. The plan, called Next Generation Windows Services, is an effort to begin moving Microsoft's software business from the PC desktop to Internet server computers that will increasingly offer information and e-commerce services to non-PC appliances.</p>
        <p>Although Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson stayed his breakup order, the company faces additional restrictions that -- unless they are stayed as well -- could be a handicap in executing those strategies.</p>
        <p>For example, it would be banned from making exclusive deals with other Internet or software companies, and restricted in offering better terms to companies that favor Microsoft's products. Such constraints may make it harder to strike strategic alliances in many new markets, like wireless devices and interactive cable television, in which Microsoft has been investing heavily.</p>
        <p>But even if those restraints are put off or ultimately overturned, some feel that the antitrust case has already stayed Microsoft's hand.</p>
        <p>''I think the very threat has changed things,'' said Robert J. Davis, chief executive of Lycos, an Internet portal that competes with Microsoft's online efforts. ''They've already been more cautious, especially in the Internet area, in the last year. They would have been buying up everything with a dot-com in its name if they thought it wouldn't have raised any eyebrows.''</p>
