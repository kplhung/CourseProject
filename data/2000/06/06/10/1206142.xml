        <p>This week the Israeli Parliament engaged in primal scream therapy for a hundred frustrations, some deep-seated, some petty.</p>
        <p>But when the lawmakers stopped venting, they found that they had altered the political reality more fundamentally than some had intended, plunging the country into a period of uncertainty.</p>
        <p>The political upside is unclear, but for some the ideological bonus is that such uncertainty creates infertile ground for peace efforts.</p>
        <p>Today is the second day of a three-day holiday weekend that Prime Minister Ehud Barak was supposed to dedicate to preparing his peace negotiators to fly to Washington for a fateful round of talks. Instead he is sidetracked by the kind of intense political negotiations that he underwent a year ago, before he took office, when he was cobbling together the broad governing coalition that is now in tatters.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, after months in which a spate of motions to declare no confidence in the government had failed, Parliament suddenly gave teeth to its protests and, in a preliminary bill, voted to disperse and head to new elections.</p>
        <p>Effectively, members voted against themselves and against their constituents, many of whom do not want to live through the tumult of another election period.</p>
        <p>''There is no objective justification,'' Chemi Shalev, a columnist, wrote in the newspaper Maariv, ''for having new elections now, less than a year after the government was established, after the withdrawal from Lebanon, before an agreement with the Palestinians and at the beginning of what could turn out to be economic prosperity.''</p>
        <p>And, if opinion polls are to be believed, it would all be for nothing anyway: a new election would produce almost the same deeply divided multiparty Parliament, with Mr. Barak again as prime minister.</p>
        <p>Appearing calm and sounding populist, Mr. Barak told the Israeli public that the bill to dissolve Parliament, which requires three more hearings, would never become law.</p>
        <p>But it could change everything anyway.</p>
        <p>What happened this week?</p>
        <p>Some say it was the dynamic of a moment, a sudden collision of parochial and ideological motivations that spontaneously combusted. The ultra-Orthodox Shas Party finally lost patience in its inexorable bid for more money for its religious school system at the same time that the right-wing parties woke up to see the peace effort nearing its endgame -- and boom.</p>
        <p>Others saw the vote on Wednesday as the final, inevitable failure of Mr. Barak's experimentally broad coalition, which sought to reconcile Israel's divergent forces inside the government and do away with the traditional left-right, religious-secular divides.</p>
        <p>Still others say the vote showed a profound structural problem with Israel's electoral system that undermines chances for a stable democracy.</p>
        <p>The system was reformed in 1996 to provide for the direct election of the prime minister on a separate ballot from his party, which weakened the traditional large parties and empowered smaller ones, which multiplied.</p>
        <p>Many political scientists here predicted chaos, and now they say that to their regret they have been proved right: any leader would be hobbled by the 17-party Parliament that is now in place, they say. The system fosters immaturity, they say, and impulse votes like the one this week that puts the frenzied lawmakers at odds with their much calmer public.</p>
        <p>And finally, there is Shas, a religious party of Sephardic Jews that has used a social service system and an ideology of ethnic pride to build itself into a political force that can make or break governments. Many in Israeli society say that Shas, which indirectly sponsored the bill and provided it key support, irresponsibly toyed with the political system this week.</p>
        <p>Many say that Shas flexed its muscles without understanding or caring that the consequences could be far-reaching, even for Shas. ''Did Shas intend to kick itself out of the government?'' asked Ephaim Sneeh, the deputy defense minister. ''Shas needs the government like a fish needs water.''</p>
        <p>But the government, at least as Mr. Barak sees it, needs Shas, too, to support its peace moves, and therein lies the predicament ahead.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak could have built a small, stable, center-left coalition a year ago, but he chose to break up the potential opposition by incorporating part of it into his government. He embraced not only Shas but two smaller parties: the National Religious Party, which represents settlers, and the Russian immigrant party led by Interior Minister Natan Sharansky.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the rightist opposition, headed by Ariel Sharon, a former defense minister, has been splintered and weak. But the government has been hobbled by its internal divisions.</p>
        <p>The National Religious Party and the Russian party have split with Mr. Barak on his peace moves. And Shas, in a running battle with the leftist education minister over what amounts to a thousandth of the ministry's budget, has channeled its disgruntlement into a rejection of the peace initiatives it was brought into the government to support.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak has subscribed to the theory that a contented Shas would help him win public backing for peace. But can Shas be satisfied? Its long-running feud with the education minister centers on a financial recovery and educational reform plan for its indebted school system; it is not just a question of money, but of legalities and of inequities in the financing of religious and secular schools. If the matter could be easily resolved, it would have been already.</p>
        <p>It remains to be seen, then, whether Mr. Barak will give Shas another chance.</p>
        <p>The prime minister has already said he will dismiss the ministers who voted against him on Wednesday. That does not mean he will dismiss their parties, but it is hard to imagine how he can avoid ending up in the same mess again if he joins forces once more with those who just humiliated him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak could choose instead to reshape his government as a center-left coalition that depended on the Israeli Arab parties for votes to support peace. But that would fuel the opposition inside Parliament and in the streets just as the government entered the most delicate period of talks with the Palestinians on a permanent peace settlement.</p>
        <p>No matter what he does, the specter of new elections hangs over Mr. Barak's head and over the negotiating table as well.</p>
        <p>It was odd, unfortunate timing for Mr. Barak. After 10 months of figuring out how he wanted to lead, he was starting to hit his stride. Most significantly, as he had promised during his campaign, he withdrew Israeli troops from Lebanon after 22 years without incident. That infused the country with a kind of euphoria that made the month of May seem like a turning point in Israeli history.</p>
        <p>But in the halls of the flat-roofed Parliament, some lawmakers treated the withdrawal and its aftermath as a forced hiatus from their more important political battles. And within two weeks of the country's uniting to welcome back the troops, the internecine feuds broke out once more.</p>
