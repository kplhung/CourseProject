        <p>When the final whistle blew tonight, the MetroStars stood in their positions for a moment, then walked slowly from the field.

        <p>Major League Soccer's worst team last season, the MetroStars were seeking the first four-game winning streak in franchise history.

        <p>When the final whistle blew tonight, the MetroStars stood in their positions for a moment, then walked slowly from the field. The game had never really been in question, as the Tampa Bay Mutiny dominated the action for a 3-0 victory at Giants Stadium, but it was more than just this game that the MetroStars were thinking about.</p>
        <p>Major League Soccer's worst team last season, the MetroStars were seeking the first four-game winning streak in franchise history. They had moved up to second place in the Eastern Division by winning three games in a row. They had beaten the Mutiny to start the streak, and had beaten Tampa Bay three straight times over all.</p>
        <p>Instead, the team struggled.</p>
        <p>''I think this is a wake-up call,'' Coach Octavio Zambrano said after the loss. ''We got into a comfort zone that's totally unrealistic.</p>
        <p>''They talk about last year, but we haven't accomplished anything. All these things seem to be an improvement from a dismal situation, but I could care less about last year. This is a game we could have won.</p>
        <p>''It was a game that we lost in our heads more than anything else.''</p>
        <p>Tampa Bay scored in the 11th minute tonight on the first career goal by Josh Keller, who took a pass from Manny Lagos and blasted a shot straight on from 25 yards. The ball deflected off MetroStars defender Mike Petke and slipped past goaltender Mike Ammann.</p>
        <p>Keller then scored the second goal of his career in the 57th minute, running onto a pass from Carlos Valderrama and ripping another hard shot from the same distance. This one sailed untouched into the right side of the net for a 2-0 lead. The MetroStars had averted danger twice on the play, with Ammann stopping one shot and then Petke clearing a rebound shot by Steve Ralston from the goal mouth. But the MetroStars could not get the ball out of their end, and Valderrama's assist gave him the odd distinction of having recorded an assist in all 10 games he has played for the Mutiny against the MetroStars.</p>
        <p>In the 88th minute, Joseph Addo scored his first M.L.S. goal, taking a cross from Lagos and delivering a left-footer into the left corner of the net from 20 yards.</p>
        <p>''We didn't have the killer instinct, and the other team did,'' Zambrano said. ''We can't come out of the locker room with the attitude that we're going to win because we have a good team now.''</p>
