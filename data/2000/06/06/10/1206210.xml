        <p>At least nine horses died last night when a fire broke out in a Brooklyn stable, fire officials said.</p>
        <p>Vito Berretta, a fire department spokesman, said the roof of Bergen Beach Stables, a wood-frame building at 1364 E. 66th Street near Avenue N in Bergen Beach, collapsed during the fire. He said nine horses were confirmed dead, and at least four others escaped safely. Usually there are about 25 horses in the stable, but there might have been less on a weekend, he said.</p>
