      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The art world lost two American originals yesterday, the painter Jacob Lawrence and the sculptor George Segal. Mr. Lawrence, who died at 82, was one of the nation's leading figural painters and a vivid chronicler of the African-American experience. Starting with satirical studies of Harlem street life, he deployed a pared-down, Cubist-inflected style that never lost contact with social reality. Mr. Segal, who died at 75, was best known for full-body plaster casts of real, seemingly ordinary people that conveyed a ghostly sense of the spiritual desolation of modern man.</p>
