        <p>Jacob E Goldman Op-Ed article rejects Microsoft Corp's assertion that government antitrust initiatives against it will stifle innovation; says company's dominance of personal computer software market is not due to its own innovation, but rather to its skill in positioning itself between the true innovators and computer users, taking from one and selling to the others (M)</p>

        <p>Bill Gates, protesting the government's antitrust initiatives against Microsoft, has asserted from the first that limiting the scope of his company's activities or breaking it up would stifle the innovation that helped Microsoft catalyze the information revolution into existence. The incongruity of this response to the Justice Department's pleadings and Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's decision is inescapable: Microsoft soared to its powerful heights on the backs of innovations that were largely the work of others.</p>
        <p>Microsoft's market exploitation of the DOS operating system that Mr. Gates acquired from the tiny Seattle Computer Products is well documented.

        <p>Bill Gates, protesting the government's antitrust initiatives against Microsoft, has asserted from the first that limiting the scope of his company's activities or breaking it up would stifle the innovation that helped Microsoft catalyze the information revolution into existence. The incongruity of this response to the Justice Department's pleadings and Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's decision is inescapable: Microsoft soared to its powerful heights on the backs of innovations that were largely the work of others.</p>
        <p>Microsoft's market exploitation of the DOS operating system that Mr. Gates acquired from the tiny Seattle Computer Products is well documented. He paid Seattle Computer $75,000 for exclusive rights to the system and was then able to extract billions from I.B.M. and its imitators in license fees. Microsoft later paid $925,000 to settle a lawsuit by Seattle Computer.</p>
        <p>What about all the other goodies that so rapidly enriched Microsoft's coffers? The big winners for Microsoft, which established its primacy in the personal computer software market, were Microsoft Word, the premier word processing program; Excel, the spread sheet program; and Windows, the graphic user interface that has become the virtual standard in the personal computer industry. These have been Microsoft's cash cows, but, as histories of the company have noted, all were innovations that came from outside the Microsoft family, having been developed in the era before software was patentable.</p>
        <p>We know that Word came virtually intact, along with its developer, from Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center, or PARC. Excel derived from the very original Visicalc program of a company called Software Arts and was later expanded and refined by Lotus. Windows originated at PARC and went to Microsoft via the Apple Macintosh. Windows and icons as the interface between a human and a computer were installed in Xerox's Alto personal computer pretty much as they appear today; the Alto was introduced in 1973, more than a decade before Microsoft brought Windows out as a product.</p>
        <p>The adoption of Windows by Microsoft was the subject of a lawsuit by Apple against Microsoft in the 1980's. Microsoft prevailed in court largely because neither Xerox nor Apple had succeeded in achieving adequate protection of this highly original concept in the days before software patents. Even Internet Explorer, which became a centerpiece in the antitrust litigation, was a Johnny-come-lately into the Internet browser market, having been anticipated and originated by Netscape. The browser was invented at the University of Illinois, and its inventor, Marc Andreessen, went on to become a founder of Netscape.</p>
        <p>One should not minimize the added functionality and utility contributed by Microsoft to these programs and the applications programs subsequently developed, many of which were similarly acquired by Microsoft from others. But is this innovation, or is it creative entrepreneurship?</p>
        <p>Considering the origin of the word entrepreneur in the French words entre (between) and preneur (taker), Bill Gates must be the consummate entrepreneur, immensely successful in positioning himself and his company between the innovators and the users, taking from one and selling to the others. But is this innovation?</p>
