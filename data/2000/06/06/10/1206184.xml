        <p>Glen Sather's first choice to become the Rangers' head coach chose to succeed Sather in Edmonton, instead.</p>
        <p>After three weeks of intense negotiations, Kevin Lowe agreed yesterday to become the general manager of the Edmonton Oilers when he agreed to a four-year deal. The announcement came two days after Lowe had formally resigned after one season as Edmonton's head coach, triggering a clause in his contract that would have made him free to negotiate with any other team following a two-week waiting period.</p>
        <p>Craig MacTavish, the Oilers' assistant coach, is expected to replace Lowe as head coach. That could leave John Paddock as the front-runner for the Rangers' job.</p>
        <p>''He won at Hartford this season,'' one National Hockey League official said, referring to Paddock and the Rangers' top minor league affiliate, which won the Calder Cup, the American Hockey League's championship. ''He knows the organization and the players. He's well-liked by the players. And he gets along with Slats.''</p>
        <p>Slats is the nickname for Sather, who has known Paddock for years. Paddock was head coach of the Winnipeg Jets from 1991 to 1995 and was the team's general manager from 1994 to 1997, when the franchise moved to  Phoenix and became the Coyotes.</p>
        <p>Sather, who resigned May 19 and joined the Rangers as general manager and president, was the Oilers' general manager for the last 21 years. There was speculation that Lowe would be reunited with Sather in New York as coach, but he chose to stay in Edmonton, where he maintains strong family ties.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to be what I've been for my whole career,'' Lowe said.  ''I'm going to be honest and hard-working and hope to continue the same sort of pride and respect and tradition that the Oilers have shown since we all began in 1979.</p>
        <p>''Hopefully I'll show the patience of Glen,'' Lowe said of his mentor.</p>
        <p>When asked who Sather's other likely candidates for the Ranger job would be, the N.H.L. official said: ''There were two in Edmonton, but both are gone now. I'm sure the Rangers will probably look around. But I wouldn't be surprised if it were Paddock.</p>
