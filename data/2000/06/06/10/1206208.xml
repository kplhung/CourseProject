        <p>One by one, they responded to Coach Larry Bird's challenge. For most of Game 2 tonight, the Indiana Pacers played the tenacious style that Bird used to fashion his Hall of Fame career.</p>
        <p>Sparked by Jalen Rose's 30 points, the Pacers battled within a few minutes of stealing the home-court advantage from the Los Angeles Lakers, before falling behind by two games to one in the four-of-seven-game National Basketball Association finals. The Pacers' will power crumbled under a series of late mistakes in a 111-104 loss at the Staples Center.</p>
        <p>Reggie Miller awoke from his shooting slump and made 7 of 16 attempts for 21 points. Austin Croshere scored 24 points off the bench and sank 12 of 12 free throws. Rose especially was a thorn in the Lakers' side, also getting nine rebounds and bailing out the Pacers after Miller and Rik Smits got into first-quarter foul trouble.</p>
        <p>''Jalen and Austin gave us a lift, and Reggie came back nicely, but we're not getting any scoring down low from out post players,'' Bird said. ''They're beating us with strength inside, and we're having to live off jump shots.''</p>
        <p>Bird tried to raise the Pacers' level of play with motivational words following their 104-87 loss in Game 1. He gave a challenge to Rose, who delivered 8 points in the fourth quarter as Indiana fought within 2 points before fading.</p>
        <p>''We had a golden opportunity,'' Miller said. ''It all would have worked for us tonight if we had just made a couple more shots and free throws at the end. Now, it's up to us to respond Sunday.''</p>
        <p>Rose also was involved in the play that might have a huge impact on this series, which continues Sunday night in Indianapolis. Rose came out to contest a jump shot by Kobe Bryant with 3 minutes 5 seconds left in the first quarter. Bryant made the shot for a 22-20 lead, but his left foot crashed onto Rose's left foot. Rose did not flinch, but Bryant rolled on the court in pain and missed the rest of the game.</p>
        <p>Rose provided the Pacers with instant offense when they needed it most. Without his 18 points, Indiana's 52-49 halftime deficit could have reached blowout proportions. He played the entire half, and although he was 6 of 14 shooting, he drew several fouls and made 6 of 8 free throws. Rose had no choice but to lead the Pacers.</p>
        <p>Miller rebounded impressively from his 1-of-16 misery in Game 1, hitting 4 of 5 shots for 10 points in the first half. But what could have turned into a Laker-breaking streak fizzled into foul trouble. Miller was called for his second foul with 6:33 remaining in the first quarter and played only 12 minutes in the half.</p>
        <p>''It's too bad he picked up a cheap foul that early,'' Bird said. ''He was in the game; he was in the flow. He did a good job coming back, but he just wasn't in the same rhythm.''</p>
        <p>Smits was like a pedestrian being whistled for jaywalking by traffic cops, playing only 10 minutes in the first half. He picked up two fouls in the first quarter, another foul late in the second quarter and two more early in the third quarter. With 4:51 gone in the second half, Smits had become a fixture on Indiana's bench and again a victim of Shaquille O'Neal's dominance.</p>
        <p>''We had enough firepower out there,'' Bird said. ''Things just didn't go our way.''</p>
        <p>Rose quickly took command of the first half, scoring 12 points by early in the second quarter. He had no assists in the first quarter, however.</p>
        <p>''I could have been a lot more aggressive and done a lot more things,'' Rose had said of Game 1. ''I didn't work my post game. I didn't work my dribble-drive game. I feel like I can create my own shots. I just have to get into the mode where I'm doing it.''</p>
        <p>Rose kept the Lakers guessing. Sometimes, he would ease into position and pull up to launch a jump shot. Other times, he would drive hard to the basket, which twice resulted in his shot being swatted away, first by Robert Horry and then by O'Neal.</p>
        <p>Even with those failed efforts, Rose had set a new tone for the Pacers. Two possessions after O'Neal blocked his layup, Rose posted low, drew a foul on Derek Fisher and made two free throws.</p>
        <p>That was exactly the kind of hard-nosed play Bird had spoken to Rose about after Game 1.</p>
        <p>''He hasn't been aggressive on the offensive end,'' Bird said before tonight's game. ''One thing that Jalen can do, he can beat a guy off the dribble, take it all the way to the hole. He's got to be more aggressive when he gets the ball.''</p>
