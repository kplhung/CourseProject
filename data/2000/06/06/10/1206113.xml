        <p>At a moment when scholarships and academic elitism are the hot-button topic in Britain's most august places of learning, enter Bill Gates.</p>
        <p>His philanthropic foundation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, is considering a request from Cambridge University for a $200 million scholarship endowment to bring 230 foreign graduate students to Cambridge each year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gates had already shown interest in the city of Cambridge's ambitions to become Britain's Silicon Valley. Its combination of research institutions and start-up technology companies has earned it the nickname Silicon Fen.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gates has given the university $19 million for a computer laboratory.</p>
        <p>But the discussion of his negotiations has become mired in a case that involves Cambridge's rival, Oxford, and that forms a mirror-image of what Mr. Gates is being asked to pay for. Political and academic luminaries around Britain have been seething over the story of a young Briton who found the doors of Oxford closed to her and ended up instead with a $100,000 scholarship to Harvard.</p>
        <p>Clearly, Cambridge wants to ensure that the two cases are not mixed up. ''These are two completely separate issues,'' said Alison McFarquhar, a university spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>Oxford and Cambridge compete to snare the top students, produce the top scholars and advance their financial standing. Some Cambridge academics said they believed that the availability of the Rhodes scholarships to 32 Americans each year gave Oxford a higher profile in the United States and, thus, a sharper blade in the harvest of alumni generosity.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gates's interest coincides with a deepening debate over how elitist an elite university should be -- and how this may be financed in a nation whose leaders, under Prime Minister Tony Blair's government, vouchsafe a deep and traditional Labor Party strain of egalitarianism.</p>
        <p>The controversy began when Laura Spence, 18, a high school student from a public state-run school in northeastern England, applied to study medicine at Oxford and was rejected after an interview, despite high grades. In Britain's league of class distinctions, state-run nonselective schools and the northeast stand at one end of a spectrum whose other extremity is occupied by private schools in the south like Eton or Harrow.</p>
        <p>When news of Ms. Spence's Harvard scholarship emerged last month, it touched raw nerves. Mr. Blair's government, smarting from recent opposition moves to seize the populist high ground, saw an opportunity to revive its Laborite credentials.</p>
        <p>Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown called it ''an absolute scandal'' and said Ms. Spence had been a victim of an interview system that ''is more reminiscent of the old boy network and the old school tie than genuine justice in our society.''</p>
        <p>Another Labor figure, Barry Sheerman, said Britain's top universities took half their students from private schools attended by 7 percent of high school scholars.</p>
        <p>The Conservatives fired back. ''When they are in trouble, they go back to class war,'' said a party spokesman, David Willetts.</p>
        <p>Cambridge says 53 percent of its first-year students are from state schools. Oxford says half its new students are from a category of state school.</p>
