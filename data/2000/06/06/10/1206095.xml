        <p>The trombonist Roswell Rudd is one of jazz's tricksters. Now 64, he is a New Englander whose career has linked New Orleans (his formal background in Dixieland bands, his rowdy but organized obbligato style) and New York's East Village (his early-60's involvement in what was called the ''new thing,'' with urgent, iconoclastic players like Archie Shepp and Milford Graves). He has been important in the revival of the works of Herbie Nichols, one of the great composers of jazz and a mentor during his younger days. He knows how to use rock and roll musicians perfectly, without condescension or groveling. And he's the kind of guy who writes bossa novas about his dog.</p>
        <p>It was only a couple of years ago that Mr. Rudd quit a regular, longstanding job playing in a Catskills  hotel band. Perhaps as a result, there is no high-art standoffishness in his recent performances, now that he's back on the scene: he's there to entertain.</p>

        <p>The trombonist Roswell Rudd is one of jazz's tricksters.

        <p>It was only a couple of years ago that Mr. Rudd quit a regular, longstanding job playing in a Catskills  hotel band. Perhaps as a result, there is no high-art standoffishness in his recent performances, now that he's back on the scene: he's there to entertain.</p>
        <p>His Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival show at the Knitting Factory on Monday night was occasionally messy, but there wasn't a scrap of aesthetic anxiety in it. It shuttled between post-Ellingtonian modernism and comedy, jazz and rock and blues. With his brass-heavy septet, Broad Strokes, he played Nichols's little-known ''Change of Season'' and a haywire mini-opera called ''God Had a Girlfriend,'' narrated by Mr. Rudd, about a good jazz club that failed after the girlfriend took it over and switched its patronage. Mr. Rudd's son, Christopher, sang a Brazil-meets-Vegas tune about Mr. Rudd's German shepherd, with typical bossa nova arrangements for flute and guitar. It wasn't great music but it was a good joke.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rudd brought with him songs about places he had been to and loved -- London's borough of Stoke Newington (''Stokey'') and Mali(''Bamako Blues''). He summoned three-quarters of Sonic Youth to perform the theme from the movie ''Babe'' -- actually an adaptation of the theme from Saint-Saens' Symphony No. 3 -- and the guitarists Thurston Moore and Lee Ranaldo built a loud, billowing, beautiful one-chord drone, with Mr. Rudd sweeping the melody through it and growling against the distortion of the guitars.</p>
        <p>And the singer Sheila Jordan came on to perform a few songs, including ''The Light,'' a song with mysterious biblical imagery backed by nothing but a doleful arrangement for three trombones. The show had a sweet subtext: Mr. Rudd made it clear that he is starting afresh and wants to share his enthusiasm.</p>
