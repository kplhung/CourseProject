        <p>Joe Puma, a jazz guitarist whose quietly reflective style placed him in demand as both a soloist and ensemble member, died on May 31 at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. He was 72 and lived in Yonkers.</p>
        <p>The cause was cancer, said his daughter Rosalie.</p>
        <p>Playing a guitar he designed and built himself, Mr. Puma earned accolades across half a century for his versatility, from his light, restrained sound and jaunty persona as a soloist to his exceptional collaborative technique as an accompanist.</p>
        <p>Following in the footsteps of his father and brothers, Puma taught himself to play guitar as a teenager, starting a professional career in 1948 after stints as an airline mechanic and a draftsman during World War II.</p>
        <p>His first major job came in 1949, when he performed with the vibraphonist Joe Roland. Over the next decade he settled into the New York jazz scene, recording with Louie Bellson, Artie Shaw's Gramercy Five, Eddie Bert, Herbie Mann, Mat Mathews, Chris Connor and Paul Quinichette, and later Bobby Hackett, Gary Burton and Carmen McRae.</p>
        <p>His subtle interaction and fluid responsiveness, often praised in reviews, made him a favorite accompanist of singers like Peggy Lee, Morgana King, Helen Merrill and Tony Bennett.</p>
        <p>Mr. Puma formed a duo with the guitarist Chuck Wayne in 1972 and appeared at the 1973 Newport Jazz Festival in New York. They were prominent on the downtown club scene for the next five years.</p>
        <p>After the duo broke up, Mr. Puma led his own trio, remaining musically active into the late 1990's. He recorded on his own for the Bethlehem, Dawn, Jubilee and Columbia labels in the 50's and 60's, and led a later session for Reservoir in 1984.</p>
        <p>Among his recordings are ''Like Tweet,'' with tunes based on bird calls.</p>
        <p>Besides his daughter, of Standish, Mich., he is survived by a son, Joseph, of Galveston, Tex.; another daughter, Loris Limiero-Gjelsten of Pelham, N.Y.; a sister, Jean LaFatta of Queens; eight grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.</p>
