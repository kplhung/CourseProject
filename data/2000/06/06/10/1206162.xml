        <p>Signaling a new era of cooperation in the volatile world of online music distribution, two major record labels said today that they had settled a copyright lawsuit with MP3.com, in a deal that permits the music start-up to store consumers' record libraries and provide access to them over the Internet.</p>
        <p>Under the settlement, MP3.com will pay roughly $20 million each to BMG Entertainment, a unit of Bertelsmann A.G., and Warner Music Group, a subsidiary of Time Warner, along with licensing fees for use of the labels' music on the service, parties close to the negotiations said.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Signaling a new era of cooperation in the volatile world of online music distribution, two major record labels said today that they had settled a copyright lawsuit with MP3.com, in a deal that permits the music start-up to store consumers' record libraries and provide access to them over the Internet.</p>
        <p>Under the settlement, MP3.com will pay roughly $20 million each to BMG Entertainment, a unit of Bertelsmann A.G., and Warner Music Group, a subsidiary of Time Warner, along with licensing fees for use of the labels' music on the service, parties close to the negotiations said.</p>
        <p>The deal hardly dispels the recording industry's pressing concerns about music piracy online, nor does it make the bulk of the music from the major record labels available for purchase and listening over the Internet. But it appears to signal a recognition by the labels and by MP3.com that the traditional and the online businesses need each other and can profit by working together.</p>
        <p>Michael Robertson, chairman and chief executive of MP3.com, declined to discuss the amount of the settlement but said that even if the reports were accurate, the fees would not jeopardize the company's long-term viability.</p>
        <p>He said the company, which is based in San Diego, had $380 million in cash reserves. ''The reality is, cash is not an issue,'' he said, adding that he believed the settlement paved the way for growth of the company.</p>
        <p>Eric Sheirer, an entertainment analyst with Forrester Research, a market research firm in Cambridge, Mass., said that by settling, the music labels at once scored a victory but also signaled a willingness to embrace the online marketplace.</p>
        <p>He said it was of symbolic importance that the record labels settled with MP3.com, which is just one of the companies that use the MP3 format to distribute music on the Internet.</p>
        <p>''It's a huge day for the recording industry,'' he said. ''They are embracing a business model that revolves around the MP3 format.''</p>
        <p>That does not mean, however, that the labels are embracing a mechanism for piracy, record industry officials said. The use of the MP3 format under the settlements announced today, they said, is confined to allowing consumers to listen only to music that they have already purchased, and not to download or trade music that they do not own.</p>
        <p>In a case that could have broader implications, the Recording Industry Association of America is pursuing a suit against Napster, an online service that provides software that Internet users employ to share and trade music files, including copyrighted material. The service says it is not responsible if some people use its software to pirate music. But the recording industry disagrees, asserting that piracy costs the industry and the artists it represents tens of millions of dollars in lost sales. That case is being heard in a federal court in Northern California.</p>
        <p>Under the deal announced today, MP3.com agreed to license, for undisclosed fees, the use of songs from BMG and Warner Music for use in its My.MP3.com service. The service allows consumers to store their own record collections on MP3.com's computers in ''virtual lockers'' and have access to them by way of the Internet.</p>
        <p>MP3.com started the My.MP3.com service in January. In hopes of making the service easy to use, the company itself bought tens of thousands of commercial compact discs. Consumers who proved they owned a copy of a given disc, by inserting it into their PC while visiting the site, would thereafter gain access to that music from the MP3.com computers.</p>
        <p>But the recording industry argued in court that MP3.com was violating copyrights by copying the music, compiling a vast database without permission or license. Although Mr. Robertson argued that his service simply extended to cyberspace consumers' legal rights to make a copy of their own music, a federal judge in New York agreed with the labels in April, finding that the practice violated copyright law because MP3.com had not received permission from the recording industry.</p>
        <p>Three other major record labels, Sony Music, EMI and Universal Music Group, said they were continuing independent settlement negotiations and declined to comment further. A spokesman for Time Warner declined to comment on the settlement. Kevin Conroy, chief marketing officer at BMG, said that ''the best enforcement is the creation of legitimate alternatives for consumers.''</p>
        <p>The lawsuit was brought by the Recording Industry Association of America, which represents the five major record labels. But because of antitrust regulations, the labels must settle the licensing agreements separately, industry officials said.</p>
        <p>If the other labels also settle for around $20 million each, as industry analysts expect, the cost to MP3.com could be $100 million or more, people close to the negotiations said.</p>
        <p>The My.MP3.com service has about 500,000 accounts, but the virtual lockers do not now include music from the major labels. Mr. Robertson said the service would continue to be free, even though MP3.com will have to pay licensing fees to the labels. He said the company would continue to rely on advertising for its revenue. The site, which also sells some items online, also offers music from independent artists.</p>
        <p>In addition to any deal struck with the major labels, MP3.com is seeking licensing deals with music publishing groups, and Mr. Robertson said that the service would not be fully functional until both sets of deals were made final.</p>
        <p>''This is building a foundation for creating a massive online business,'' Mr. Robertson said, calling the settlement a ''win-win'' for the two parties. ''Shareholders of major record labels are getting a bite of the online apple,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The deal apparently played well with investors. Shares of MP3.com rose $1.9375, to $19.1875, in Nasdaq trading today.</p>
        <p>Industry analysts said the settlement might indeed represent a partial victory for MP3.com and for Mr. Robertson, who has ruffled many feathers in the recording industry by asserting that traditional music business models have been outdated in the Internet era.</p>
        <p>Michael B. Nathanson, a music industry analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company in New York, said he was surprised that the settlement came so quickly.</p>
        <p>''I would have thought they would punish Mr. Robertson,'' he said, ''But what it shows me is they realize there's a lot of traffic on his site and that at the end of the day, it makes sense to work with these sites rather than oppose them.''</p>
