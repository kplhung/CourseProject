        <p>By now, many Americans can claim at least a passing familiarity with the 14th Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual and political leader of Tibet.

        <p>By now, many Americans can claim at least a passing familiarity with the 14th Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual and political leader of Tibet. He was well enough known, for example, to have drawn an audience in the tens of thousands for a public teaching he gave in Central Park last August. And, perhaps more to the point, he has had a book, ''The Art of Happiness'' (Riverhead), on the best-seller lists for well over a year.</p>
        <p>But how many know of the 41st Sakya Trizin, supreme head of one of Tibetan Buddhism's four traditions, or schools? He has just embarked on a three-month teaching visit to the United States and Canada that began this week in New York.</p>
        <p>''He's second only in importance to the Dalai Lama,'' said Jeff Watt, a translator of Tibetan texts who also is a consultant to a philanthropic group that is planning a museum of Tibetan and related art in New York.</p>
        <p>To illustrate his point, Mr. Watt, who is a former monk in the Sakya tradition, said that in religious ceremonies in Lhasa, Tibet's capital, the seat of honor after the Dalai Lama would go to the Sakya Trizin, whose title means ''Holder of the Sakya Throne.'' (Such ceremonies would happen, of course, before the Chinese invaded Tibet in 1959, severely disrupting its religious life and causing both the Dalai Lama and the Sakya Trizin to flee to India.)</p>
        <p>Unlike the Dalai Lama, the Sakya Trizin does not visit the United States often. But like the Dalai Lama, he is well aware that Buddhism has achieved a wide interest in this country. ''So many people want to learn the dharma,'' he said, in an interview yesterday in a Manhattan hotel.</p>
        <p>The 54-year-old Sakya Trizin, who is referred to by his followers as ''his holiness,'' is fluent in English. How does he advise people to begin a serious study of Buddhism, he was asked. One needs to find ''authentic teachers,'' he replied, to guide one in study, meditation and contemplation.</p>
        <p>''So the first important thing is to establish the relationship between teacher and disciples,'' the Sakya Trizin continued. ''The student should examine the teacher, the teacher should examine the student. Once they are satisfied with each other, then you establish the link.''</p>
        <p>Reading is important, too, he said, in the works that deal with ''the essence of the Buddha's teachings.''</p>
        <p>What particularly distinguishes the Sakya Trizin is that he belongs to a lineage -- the Khon family -- whose roots go back 12 centuries, to one of the first seven monks initiated into the faith in Tibet.</p>
        <p>''So this is the oldest religious family to come down from those times,'' Mr. Watt said.</p>
        <p>The actual Sakya school (the word means ''white earth'') takes its name from a monastery established by leaders of the lineage in 1073, beneath a circle of white clay on the slopes of a Tibetan mountain. In the 13th century, a head of school became a spiritual tutor to the Mongol emperor Kublai Khan, a grandson and eventual successor to the conqueror Genghis Khan.</p>
        <p>The last time the Sakya Trizin was in New York, he said, was a decade ago. He is making this trip to meet with people involved in Sakya Buddhist practice and to encourage them. The journey's centerpiece will be a six-week stop in Vancouver, British Columbia, where his sister lives and runs a Buddhist center.</p>
        <p>In Vancouver, where he is scheduled to arrive on June 29, he will discuss a fundamental Sakya text, the Lam Dre (the title means, ''The Path Together With the Result''). The text, which now runs to more than 30 volumes, offers a complete path to enlightenment attainable -- at best -- in one lifetime, Mr. Watt said.</p>
        <p>The Sakya Trizin said, ''The whole goal is to reach the ultimate truth, because when you realize the ultimate truth you are free, and when you are free, you can help the sentient beings.''</p>
        <p>The Sakya Trizin made it clear that he was impressed with America's cultural pluralism. That would be in keeping with the outlook of one of his ancestors, who so firmly believed that the various schools of Buddhism should be allowed to flourish in Tibet that he talked Kublai Khan out of ordering Tibetans to follow the Sakya school.</p>
        <p>''I think America is a great country, where all the people -- different religions, different cultures -- can find a home,'' the Sakya Trizin said. ''And so it is a very good thing.''</p>
        <p>He added that ''all the major religions can play an important role'' toward making society better. What is essential, he said, is that whatever religious path an individual is on, he or she should practice that faith.</p>
        <p>''Only through this,'' he said, ''can one find peace and happiness.''</p>
