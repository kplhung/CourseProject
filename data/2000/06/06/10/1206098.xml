        <p>ETHIOPIA, ERITREA: POSSIBLE PACT  Eritrea said it had accepted cease-fire proposals from the Organization of African Unity to end its two-year border war with Ethiopia, which is expected to respond today. News of the proposals, after negotiations in Algiers, coincided with charges by Eritrea that Ethiopia had unleashed an all-out attack along the front close to Assab.</p>

        <p>NIGERIA: OIL PRICE STRIKE  A general strike over sharp fuel price increases halted all flights at Nigerian airports, and the action also spread to seaports and the oil industry, officials said. The commercial capital, Lagos, was paralyzed for the second day in what threatens to be the biggest disruption in Africa's biggest oil exporter since military rule ended a year ago. Unions rejected President Olusegun Obasanjo's offer to halve the 50 percent rise, instituted as part of a policy of ending government subsidies.</p>

        <p>MIDDLE EAST</p>
        <p>ISRAEL, LEBANON: BORDER DELAY  Verification of Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon has been delayed, United Nations officials said. At least one point along the border is in contention, and another 24 to 48 hours may be needed to complete the process of verifying the line from both sides, officials said. Verification is one of the prerequisites for the deployment of United Nations troops.</p>

        <p>LIBYA: IRISH TRADE RESUMES  Foreign Minister Brian Cowen of Ireland signed a pact to end a four-year-old Libyan ban on importing live Irish cattle. Before an outbreak of mad-cow disease in 1996, Libya imported 50,000 Irish cattle a year, more than any other country. Libya, once accused of smuggling arms to the Irish Republican Army, has begun to normalize relations with Ireland.</p>

        <p>CANADA: E. COLI PAYOUTS  After one of North America's worst E. coli outbreaks, Ontario has offered full compensation to residents of Walkerton, the affected town. The outbreak last month killed 7 people and sickened about 40 percent of the farming town's population of 5,000. Six class-action suits have been filed, and anyone choosing the settlement will not be able to pursue legal action, the government said.</p>

        <p>MEXICO: STRIKERS PROTEST  A week into a nationwide strike against Aeromexico, flight attendants carried out protests in front of airport counters in Mexico City, Guadalajara, Monterrey, Cancun and Tijuana. To prevent the attendants from paralyzing air traffic, government administrators have taken over the airline and ordered some 1,500 striking attendants to stay on the job or be replaced.</p>

        <p>SOUTH KOREA: U.S. ACCORD  The United States and North Korea agreed to resume a joint effort to locate and recover the remains of thousands of American servicemen who are unaccounted for from the Korean War. The agreement was struck on the third day of negotiations in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, between representatives of the Defense Department and the North Korean People's Liberation Army, American officials said.</p>

        <p>PAKISTAN: SHARIF BOYCOTT  Lawyers for the deposed prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, boycotted his trial on corruption charges, saying it was impossible for a fair trial to be held within the confines of Attock Fort, a 16th-century landmark used by the military.</p>

        <p>INDONESIA: SUHARTO PLEA DENIED  A court threw out a suit intended to invalidate the reopening of an official corruption investigation into former President Suharto. The court upheld Attorney General Marzuki Darusman's decision to reopen the investigation into charges that Mr. Suharto and his family illegally amassed a fortune during his rule.</p>

        <p>SRI LANKA: 60 HELD IN BLAST  The police detained more than 60 people for questioning after a suicide bomber killed a government minister and 22 other people in Colombo, a senior police official said. In the northern battle zone, an army officer said troops began an offensive east of Jaffna against Tamil Tiger rebels, whom the government blames for the bombing.</p>

        <p>EUROPE</p>
        <p>NETHERLANDS: LOCKERBIE TRIAL  The defense complained that the two Libyan defendants in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 were getting poor translations of witness testimony. The men listen to simultaneous translation into Arabic on earphones. The court ordered they be given translated verbatim transcripts of all the testimony in the trial so far and ordered an inquiry into the ability of the interpreters.</p>

        <p>RUSSIA: PUSHING MISSILE PLAN  Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, left, continued Moscow's effort to sell its alternative to the United States missile defense proposals by briefing NATO allies on the plan in Brussels. NATO's secretary general, Lord Roberston, said the plan was still short on details. Mr. Sergeyev said only that it did not violate or compromise the Antiballistic Missile Treaty.</p>

        <p>ITALY: STRAIGHTENING OUT  The Leaning Tower of Pisa, closed for a decade, is leaning a little less and officials hope it will reopen next year. The 14th-century tower is inclining 5.2 inches less than it was in January 1999, said a spokesman for a project to save the tower. Work is expected to continue for about another year before the 189-foot monument can reopen.</p>
