        <p>Mike Piazza, the Mets catcher, showed better range of motion today after mildly spraining the medial collateral ligament in his left knee crossing first base on Saturday. But the Mets held him out of baseball activities like squatting, pivoting and hitting, and Piazza is expected to miss two to four more games.</p>
        <p>Joe McEwing is the Mets' first option as an emergency catcher behind Todd Pratt, and Manager Bobby Valentine said he doubted the Mets would need to make a roster move to promote a catcher while Piazza recovers.</p>

        <p>Another injured Met, center fielder Darryl Hamilton, has been on a rehabilitation assignment at Class AAA Norfolk, Va., because of a toe injury. Hamilton has reached the 30- to 40-at-bat range the Mets said he needed before returning.</p>
        <p>Hamilton could see time at all three outfield positions when he comes back, but with three starters playing well, Valentine said he had no plan for how to use Hamilton.</p>
