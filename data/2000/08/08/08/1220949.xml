        <p>Fault lines trace how the Earth cracks and slides at its surface. How rocks a few miles down move is less clear.</p>
        <p>For Dr. Wolfgang Mueller, a postdoctoral researcher at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, the history of the tectonic stresses that created France's Pyrenees Mountains can be seen in a tiny strand of quartz.</p>
        <p>Six to eight miles underground, high pressure and hot temperatures -- more than 500 degrees -- transform rocks into a taffy-like consistency, able to bend without breaking. Embedded within the Pyrenees rocks are crystals of pyrite, a hard, yellow mineral formed out of iron and sulfur sediments when the region was still a shallow sea.</p>
        <p>Because of the stiffness of the pyrite crystals, as the tectonic forces twisted the rocks, gaps a few ten-thousandths of an inch wide opened next to the crystals. Mineral-rich water almost immediately seeped in, then evaporated, leaving behind a tiny crystal of quartz.</p>
        <p>Over millions of years, as the rocks continued to deform, the quartz deposit grew into a strand up to half an inch long. Radioactive dating of different sections of the quartz strand provides a time line of the stresses acting on the rock surrounding the pyrite crystal. The findings were reported in the June 23 issue of the journal Science.</p>
        <p>One surprise, Dr. Mueller said, is that the deformation history stretched over 37 million years, from 87 million years ago to 50 million years ago. He had expected the stresses would push and pull in one region for a few million years before shifting elsewhere.</p>
        <p>''It's tracing the construction of the Pyrenees,'' he said. ''And that's only in one tiny piece of rock.''</p>
