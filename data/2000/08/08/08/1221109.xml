        <p>CBS Sports has turned down an offer to buy the same major league baseball television rights that NBC has controlled for the past five seasons.</p>
        <p>''We said no, but we'll continue our discussions,'' said LeslieAnne Wade.</p>
        <p>Richard Levin, a spokesman for baseball, said, ''Last I heard, they're still negotiating.''</p>
        <p>NBC and Fox recently refused baseball's offer to renew their deals at triple the rate they have paid since 1996. Their deals expire after this season.</p>
        <p>NBC would not increase its payments to $240 million annually, from $80 million, and Fox rejected a jump to $345 million a year, from $115 million.</p>
        <p>CBS's interest has squarely been on NBC's package because it contains only postseason games. Fox's package includes Saturday afternoon regular-season games. Fox and NBC have rotated coverage of the All-Star Game and World Series.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for ABC Sports had no comment on whether it has also rejected a chance to buy NBC's package.</p>
        <p>If baseball scales back its demands, it must first offer the reduced-price packages to NBC and Fox before letting CBS or ABC bid.</p>
