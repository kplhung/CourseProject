        <p>Sales started sliding at the Katos' small sake shop here a decade ago, when trucks began coming into the neighborhood and selling cut-price beer and other alcoholic beverages off their tailgates.</p>
        <p>Now the trucks have been put out of business by convenience stores, supermarkets and discount shops, but Yoshiro Kato and his wife, Mitsuko, soldier on, determined to resist forces that could turn shops like theirs into quaint memories of a Japan that no longer exists.</p>
        <p>''It's deregulation,'' she said. ''People in government say Americans have deregulation, so we should, too, but those saying that don't understand the feelings of people like us who are just struggling to survive. It's like they're telling us, just hurry up and die, would you.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kato has suppressed her anger many times as once-loyal customers walk past the shop in this Tokyo suburb, lugging heavy bottles of alcohol from the supermarket nearby. She does not blame them for the shop's waning business. Her own children, she said, frequent discount stores, drawn by ample parking space, late hours and low prices.</p>
        <p>Roughly 10 years have passed since Japan began to dismantle the list of licenses, permits and other regulatory approvals that were long part of breaking into business here. Under deregulation, competition has grown, the number of stores has increased and Japanese consumers now enjoy many of the same benefits as Americans in areas ranging from convenience banking to the purchase of gasoline. But the endangered shotengai, or local shopping district, has become a rallying point against deregulation among Japanese worried that they are destroying something precious.</p>
        <p>In some isolated cases, the forces opposing deregulation are prevailing. Neighborhood groups have banded together to fight incursions by big store chains. And in a throwback to a more regulated era, large retailers must now get permission from local committees to open stores.</p>
        <p>''Deregulation has been accepted without any criticism in Japan as a great measure for reviving the economy,'' said Shoji Muranuki, leader of a citizens' group that won concessions from a retail chain seeking to open in the neighborhood. ''But how can we say that deregulation is helping the economy when so many local shopkeepers and merchants are hurting because of it?''</p>
        <p>Groups like Mr. Muranuki's and business associations that sat by quietly as the effects of deregulation spread are now increasingly vocal about drawing the line somewhere. Breaking up a telephone monopoly like the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation is one thing, they say, but destroying the livelihoods of local shopkeepers is going too far. This sympathy for local shopkeepers has given them a powerful means of defense that N.T.T. does not have.</p>
        <p>''The difference is like the difference between an elephant and an ant,'' said Hiroshi Yamada, the mayor of Suginami ward in Tokyo, when asked to compare the power of small shops with that of N.T.T., the telecommunications giant that is under heavy political pressure to accept further deregulation. ''N.T.T. bows to the politicians, but the politicians bow to the local shopkeepers.''</p>
        <p>Shopkeepers have traditionally been the backbone of the Japanese neighborhood. They organize festivals that make the long, sticky summers here tolerable. They are active in school affairs and community sports. They hang out in front of their shops, chatting with patrons and handing out candy or small toys to children.</p>
        <p>''They might be feeble in terms of their sales power, but they have a big say in what happens in local areas,'' Mr. Yamada said. They lack the financial resources of big corporations like N.T.T, he said, ''but the local shop owners can collect something even more valuable -- votes.''</p>
        <p>As a young member of Parliament a few years ago, Mr. Yamada was a strong proponent of deregulation. But as a local politician, he has pressed for passage of an ordinance to restrict the discount stores in the interest of protecting his constituents from the traffic jams, even the motorcycle gangs, that some say will blight their neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>''Now that I have come to the front line, I have learned that just legislating deregulation does not make deregulation fruitful,'' he said. ''I realize that many conditions need to be imposed to make deregulation work in society.''</p>
        <p>That may be, but the shotengai are one of the biggest drags on Japan's sputtering economy. According to a new study by the McKinsey Global Institute that attributes Japan's economic troubles to low productivity, traditional shops like the Katos' are far less productive than their counterparts in the United States.</p>
        <p>Many shops stay in business in part because of high tax penalties that discourage them from selling their property. Government loan guarantees and subsidies also make it easier to survive.</p>
        <p>But the McKinsey study discloses another important source of the traditional shopkeeper's power: mom-and-pop shops account for 55 percent of retail employment here, while the entire retail industry accounts for 12 percent of total employment and 5 percent of the gross domestic product.</p>
        <p>Kabun Muto, a senior member of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, is making a name for himself as a champion of small liquor-store owners like the Katos, and as a critic of deregulation in general. He has submitted a bill to postpone any further deregulation that could hurt neighborhood stores.</p>
        <p>Mr. Muto and the 220 representatives who support him also oppose the relaxation of rules on taxicab licensing. Mr. Muto contends that looser rules have given organized criminal groups a toehold in the taxi business.</p>
        <p>''There is less intervention by the bureaucracy now,'' said Mr. Muto, whose family owns a sake brewery. ''But in creating such an open environment, we have weakened society, and people would have different opinions about whether that's a good thing or not.''</p>
        <p>So Japanese are grappling with the question of whether the social costs that concern Mr. Muto -- the loss of livelihood by shopkeepers who are often pillars of their communities and a potential increase in troubled youth -- offset the benefits of deregulation.</p>
        <p>In the fiscal year that ended in March 1998, the Economic Planning Agency estimated that deregulation had created 8.6 trillion yen, or $83 billion at current exchange rates, in consumer benefits.</p>
        <p>The agency also concluded that growth was notably strong that year in deregulated businesses like telephone services, electricity and gasoline, even as the overall economy shrank. ''The progress in the last few years has been marvelous,'' said Yoshihiko Miyauchi, chairman of the government's Regulatory Reform Committee.</p>
        <p>He regards Mr. Muto's campaign and the lobbying of the All-Japan Liquor Merchants' Association -- whose officials paid 300 visits to politicians last year and contributed nearly $400,000 to the ruling party -- as a sign of how far deregulation has penetrated the economy. ''One reason we have these types of movements is because the efforts we have made are having an effect,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Yet Japan is falling behind the other big economic powers, as Mr. Miyauchi sees it. ''We are walking in the right direction at a very leisurely pace,'' he said, ''congratulating ourselves for our progress, while other countries are running this race like Olympic athletes.''</p>
        <p>Those pressing for fast-paced regulatory change here seem more like, well, Don Quixote -- which happens to be the name of a discount store chain that has become the bane of the groups opposing deregulation. The Don Quixote store in the Suginami district has become a cause celebre on both sides of the argument, with its extended hours, big parking lot and cut-rate prices.</p>
        <p>Neighborhood residents and local merchants united last year and gathered 6,271 signatures in their campaign to keep Don Quixote out. The group argued that the store would increase traffic and worsen pollution. They said some merchandise -- in particular, sexually explicit toys and videos, as well as knives -- would end up in the hands of youngsters.</p>
        <p>Plus, ''if the store operated 24 hours a day, regular shops could not compete,'' said Mr. Muranuki, a retired salaryman who leads the group. ''Already, our shops are suffering from large-sized retailers like supermarkets.''</p>
        <p>The group extracted some concessions from Don Quixote. The store agreed to close from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. daily, to avoid flashy advertising and handouts that might lead to litter, and to keep the risque merchandise and the knives off its shelves.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the Suginami local legislature passed an ordinance early last month allowing the mayor to block the opening of stores larger than 500 square meters -- almost 5,400 square feet -- if he thinks the owner has not addressed local concerns.</p>
        <p>The ordinance revived restrictions on retailers that had recently been abolished by the Japanese government. ''Now, the entire nation is focusing on what's happened here,'' Mr. Muranuki said proudly.</p>
        <p>Takao Yasuda, the president of Don Quixote and a passionate proponent of deregulation, contends that the citizens group won a Pyrrhic victory. His store did open, and its sales are running 30 percent above expectations. ''We are closed in hours when few customers would visit the store anyway,'' Mr. Yasuda said, ''and if the store is closed, we can do preparatory work like straightening up the cash registers and shelves.''</p>
        <p>Members of the group that opposed the liquor store acknowledge that their worries have proved unfounded -- and they take credit for that. They still watch the store, patrolling the parking lot between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. and making spot checks of the merchandise.</p>
        <p>''Right now, the shop isn't causing any trouble,'' said Kyoko Hashiguchi, the group's secretary. ''Traffic jams outside the store are much less than we expected because local people seem to ride their bicycles to the store.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Yasuda says he is concerned about the precedent the fight in the Suginami district has established. The citizens' appeal to quality-of-life concerns has resonated in the news media and with politicians in a way that complaints solely about the economic impact of deregulation have not.</p>
        <p>Their ability to enlist local officials in their cause is also alarming, he said, adding that the ordinance's vague command that retailers must ''protect the environment'' leaves plenty of room for government interference.</p>
        <p>''The ordinance itself is not so strong,'' Mr. Yasuda said, ''but I worry that it is rather arbitrary and fuzzy in its meaning.'' Then he added, ''In a uniquely Japanese way, the local government can exercise its own power of interpretation, and that worries me.''</p>
