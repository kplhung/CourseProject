        <p>Police Commissioner Howard Safir, whose department won accolades for routing crime and scorn for its unraveling relationship with many of the black and Latino citizens it served, is expected to announce today that he is leaving the job by the end of this month, officials said.</p>
        <p>Several officials said Mr. Safir, 58, who is being treated for prostate cancer, will announce that he is taking a job as an executive with Choice Point, a corporate security firm in Atlanta.</p>
        <p>With the departure of Mr. Safir, a loyal, taciturn administrator who spent four years in the job, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani will have to select his third and most likely last commissioner to lead the agency whose work has done the most to form the public perception of his tenure.</p>
        <p>Among the names being mentioned are Chief of Department Joseph P. Dunne, the No. 3 official in the department; Nicholas Scoppetta, the commissioner of the Administration for Children's Services; and Bernard B. Kerik, commissioner of the Department of Correction. [Page B4.]</p>
        <p>Spokesmen for Mr. Safir, the 39th man to hold the post of commissioner and the first Jewish one, refused to discuss his plans. But several officials said that he was expected to announce a post with the security firm and might also work to expand the use of DNA to solve crimes, an effort he championed as commissioner.</p>
        <p>Mr. Safir's health was not thought to be an issue in his departure, several officials said. He had returned to work only yesterday after a vacation in which he had cruised in Alaskan waters with his wife, Carol.</p>
        <p>As the chief executive overseeing the 40,000-member police force, Mr. Safir shared in the credit for New York City's plummeting crime rate, which mirrored a national trend. The city's drop began under Mayor David N. Dinkins, but accelerated sharply during the Giuliani administration. Although murder rose slightly last year, crime remains lower over all than it has been in more than three decades, and the safer streets have been a large factor in New York's resurgence as a tourist and business capital.</p>
        <p>The continuing crime reduction has confounded skeptics who questioned whether Mr. Safir, a quiet and aloof man, would be able to fill the shoes of his more affable predecessor, William J. Bratton, an innovator who was widely seen as one of the architects of the city's more aggressive approach to public safety. But Mr. Safir ended up even improving the record in reducing crime and undercut the perception that he was merely a caretaker in the post.</p>
        <p>During the latter part of his tenure, however, those gains have been largely overshadowed by a series of incidents, like the shooting of Amadou Diallo and station house torture of Abner Louima, that have raised concerns about whether the police, in their zeal to cut crime, have trampled the civil rights of citizens, particularly blacks and Latinos.</p>
        <p>Federal investigators have found the city lax in its handling of brutal officers, and the United States Civil Rights Commission concluded in April that police anticrime units appeared to engage in racial profiling.</p>
        <p>Mr. Safir, who instituted his own police training program known as Courtesy, Professionalism and Respect, contends that high-profile cases like that of Mr. Diallo have blurred a less-sensational reality: that the number of police shootings, civilian complaints and brutality lawsuits have fallen.</p>
        <p>But some black and Hispanic New Yorkers said that Mr. Safir had often hurt his own cause by adopting a defensive style. Dennis Walcott, president of the New York Urban League, recounted a meeting at the University Club several months ago at which the commissioner showed up apparently in an effort to begin a dialogue about the police and race relations.</p>
        <p>Many people tried to describe the problem, Mr. Walcott said, but Mr. Safir, armed with charts, seemed intent on showing that the public perception of brutality was a mistake. ''The unfortunate consensus after the meeting was that it did not seem that he had heard us,'' Mr. Walcott said.</p>
        <p>Even as he has resolutely defended his officers, Mr. Safir has never been particularly popular with them. The Patrolmen's Benevolent Association cast a vote of no-confidence in his leadership last year, and many officers dismissed Mr. Safir early on as the mayor's marionette.</p>
        <p>Allies and mayoral aides have said these officers missed how artfully Mr. Safir, an accomplished administrator who spent 26 years as a federal law enforcement official, advocated for his agency, securing additions in staff and expansions in overtime that have fueled various anticrime initiatives.</p>
        <p>''I think it was better for the department that you had a good working relationship between the Police Department and the mayor,'' said Richard J. Condon, a former police commissioner. ''And I always thought he had a very dignified air about him that the department benefited from.''</p>
        <p>But Public Advocate Mark Green, who has called several times for Mr. Safir's resignation, called him a ''failed commissioner.''</p>
        <p>''While crime continued to subside,'' Mr. Green said, ''he unnecessarily allowed a racial polarization to grow because he would not move fast enough or far enough in reforming recruitment, training and discipline.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Safir's announcement comes just weeks after his second in command, Patrick E. Kelleher, announced his retirement. Deputy Commissioner Martin O'Boyle, who directs the Organized Crime Control Bureau, has also told officials that he plans to retire soon.</p>
        <p>Last night, Mr. Safir told WPIX-TV, Channel 11, ''there will be some change.''</p>
        <p>But, he added, ''I don't want to talk about it until the mayor actually announces it.''</p>
        <p>Tonight, after the announcement, Mr. Safir is expected to be the honored guest at a dinner at Cite restaurant in Midtown being held by friends, including Joseph Rosetti, a senior adviser at the security firm where he is expected to take a job.</p>
        <p>Mr. Safir, a Bronx native, had no prior relationship with the department when he was appointed commissioner in 1996. After graduating from Hofstra University and Brooklyn Law School, he spent several years as a federal drug agent, often working undercover, then served in several posts at the United States Marshals Service.</p>
        <p>Mr. Safir's grit made him an attractive candidate in 1994 to Mr. Giuliani, a newly elected mayor in search of a fire commissioner. Mr. Safir, who had worked with Mr. Giuliani when they both held federal posts in Washington, was then running his own private security firm. He spent two years as fire commissioner before being chosen to succeed Mr. Bratton.</p>
        <p>Two of Mr. Safir's core traits as commissioner have been his loyalty and his ability to live comfortably in the shadow of Mr. Giuliani, whose relationship with Mr. Bratton disintegrated into squabbling over who got credit for cutting crime.</p>
        <p>Mr. Safir has not competed for headlines with the mayor. But in the last year, as he contemplated the next step in his career, Mr. Safir has seemed to hunger more for attention and credit. Frequently, his aides work to ensure that his name will appear prominently in articles and complain, at times, when it does not.</p>
        <p>But major crime news is still often released at City Hall, where Mr. Safir stands just off the mayor's left shoulder, a tall, unsmiling man with a jutting jaw and erect posture. Mr. Safir has said the popular perception of him as sour is mistaken, a misimpression created by a facial feature, a downturned mouth, that is beyond his control.</p>
        <p>In recounting his own achievements, Mr. Safir has sought credit for his expansion of antidrug efforts, which have been credited with reducing the murder rate, and his campaign to promote the greater use of DNA in criminal cases.</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 9, 2000, Wednesday  Because of an editing error, a chart yesterday with an article about Howard Safir's plan to resign as New York City police commissioner misstated the comparative numbers of killings in 1998 in New York and Chicago. New York had 628 killings that year, fewer than Chicago, a city less than half its size; the number was not 628 fewer than Chicago's.</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 10, 2000, Thursday  An article on Tuesday about Howard Safir's intention to resign as New York police commissioner referred incorrectly to his studies at Brooklyn Law School. He attended but did not graduate.</p>
