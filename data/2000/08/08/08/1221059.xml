        <p>Raising taxes on cigarettes is key to reducing smoking, especially among the poor, the young and the poorly educated, according to a report by the World Bank and the World Health Organization on the economic aspects of tobacco. Raising taxes on tobacco does not cause job losses or increased smuggling, according to the three-year 5,120-page study by 40 economists and other specialists. The study calculated that a 10 percent increase in cigarette prices would lead 42 million people to quit smoking and prevent about 10 million tobacco-related deaths. Gro Harlem Brundtland, head of the W.H.O., has been seeking a global treaty limiting tobacco advertising and marketing.</p>
