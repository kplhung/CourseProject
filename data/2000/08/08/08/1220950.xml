        <p>For those of us helplessly in love with the marches of John Philip Sousa, his stage works are phantoms. The New Grove Dictionary of Opera has no entry for Sousa at all, although pieces like ''The Glass Blowers,'' played on Saturday afternoon at the Glimmerglass Opera, were busily performed and warmly received during the first quarter of the 20th century.</p>
        <p>Sousa saw himself as America's response to Gilbert and Sullivan, and in tone and method there are similarities. ''The Glass Blowers,'' which appeared in 1913, gently mocks the issues of the day and finds in social revolution and labor reform an absurdity equal to capitalism and conspicuous consumption. There are false pairings among four lovers that are righted in the end. Plutocrats engage in stock market warfare or else gingerly experiment with factory jobs. Beefy men of various ethnic origins trumpet the rights of workers. The time is 1898, and the Spanish-American War descends on all involved.</p>
        <p>Leonard Liebling was not a librettist in the class of W. S. Gilbert, but his humor could be deft. Sousa may not send us the memorable melodies of Arthur Sullivan (though if we heard Sousa's more often, that impression might change), but he was a far more interesting harmonist and a marvelous craftsman. The sudden flights of modulation are done with splendid confidence and equilibrium.</p>
        <p>''The Glass Blowers'' is admittedly a period piece, but it is a graceful and vital one. Sousa's joy in adamant forward movement, unequivocal meter and strong downbeats carry over to his stage music. But there is here a paradox of delicacy wedded to muscle: the music sweeps one along. Perhaps too often what the ear expects happens, but there are surprises. The Glimmerglass Opera plans to bring the piece to the New York City Opera. Some will find it frivolous: a European-style operetta with a hard, bright American edge. I found it a constant pleasure.</p>
        <p>''The Glass Blowers'' also benefits from Christopher Alden's wise direction. Camp is at a minimum. The ridiculous -- both intentional and otherwise -- is noted but greeted with affection. John Conklin's set is a deep rectangle of glassy walls with odd little tricks of perspective. Gabriel Berry's costumes come in bright, strong blocks of color coding and feature some endearing quick-change devices. I hope John DeMain will be conducting at the City Opera too. His work had the elegance and energy missing from the wan orchestra playing at Friday night's ''Salome.'' The singing for the Sousa was by bright and attractive young performers. Maria Kanyova (Annabelle), Jennifer Dudley (Geraldine), Jeffrey Lentz (Jack) and Richard Whitehouse (the Duke) made up the quartet of confused lovers.</p>
        <p>Also in the Glimmerglass repertory this summer is Puccini's ever-present ''La Boheme,'' here in an updating that places Rodolfo (Raul Hernandez), Mimi (Kelley Nassief) and the whole gang at the brink of World War I. This afternoon's offering was hardly an opera at all. Handel's ''Acis and Galatea'' from 1718 gives the bare narrative of Ovid's tale and then sends us home happy and earlier than expected. Mark Lamos's production is another update: summer sybarites in folding chairs, a large cherub reclining against a hillside and painted lavender. The singers are also dancers, and the women make a point of showing a lot of leg.</p>
        <p>So slight are the theatrical possibilities that period or modern stage pictures don't really matter. I could have done without the flying beach balls and other stilted frolicking, but ''Acis and Galatea'' is about music, and Handel's here is breathtaking. Arias, duos, quartets and choruses are marvels of contrapuntal beauty. Graeme Jenkins conducted with a nice pointed energy. The singing, like the recorder and oboe parts, ask for agility. Floyd Hebert and Eileen Whalen supplied the last two with considerable virtuosity.</p>
        <p>The vocal roles are not easy. Christine Brandes (Galatea) and Dean Elzinga (a Polyphemus with a miner's lamp for his one eye) were strong performers. Handel's florid detail did not sit easily for John Tessier, who sang Damon. John McVeigh's Acis suffered a little rhythmic looseness and a general reluctance to keep up with Mr. Jenkins's quick (and I think, correct) tempos. There were also pitch problems, mainly a slight but persistent sharpness.</p>
        <p>I hope the Glimmerglass people will think hard about exporting their ''Salome'' to New York or anywhere. It brings little credit to the company. The ingredients are fine. Andrew Jackness's set is a threatening dropped ceiling looming over a bare space. Elizabeth Byrne sings convincingly in the title role. Ned Barth as Jokanaan is even better. Kenneth Riegel and Robynne Redmon might have been an effective Herod and Herodias had they not been burdened by Leon Major's directorial concept: an amalgam of staggers, eye rollings, grimaces, fluttering fingertips and karate-chop arm wavings.</p>
        <p>Rather than recreate Strauss's dreadful characters with some kind of intellectual and creative energy, this ''Salome'' seems to have ordered from a catalog of operatic cliches. The fact that Herodias has a drinking problem is presented to us with sledgehammer subtlety. Spear carriers and supernumeraries look sheepish. A nonopera person seeking enlightenment at Friday's performance could not be blamed for bursting into laughter and never entering the opera house again.</p>
        <p>Most unfortunate was the sex-kitten persona created for Ms. Byrne, a style unsuited to this otherwise admirable singer. Over Salome's famous dance on Friday let us draw an eighth veil of charity.</p>
