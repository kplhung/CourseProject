        <p>Seattle Manager Lou Piniella stepped from the visitors' dugout before the national anthem yesterday, made eye contact with his counterpart across the field and dramatically doffed his cap and bent a knee in respectful tribute. Yankee Manager Joe Torre and his staff responded in kind.</p>
        <p>Those might be the last acts of civility between teams possibly heading for a playoff showdown. The Mariners whipped the Yankees, 8-5, in spite of four home runs by the Yankees on a hot and steamy afternoon, and exchanged knockdown pitches before departing Yankee Stadium with three straight victories in the four-game series.</p>
        <p>It was a cranky day for the Yankees, all things considered. After reliever Jeff Nelson was ejected for offering an opinion on the work of the home plate umpire, Mark Carlson, Chuck Knoblauch, the Yankees' leadoff hitter, was placed on the 15-day disabled list with an elbow injury that may or may not improve this season. The Yankees made a minor deal for the backup infielder Luis Sojo, trading the minor league pitcher Chris Spurling to the Pittsburgh Pirates, and a larger acquisition in claiming the slugger Jose Canseco on waivers.</p>
        <p>Knoblauch, on the disabled list for the first time in his 10-year career, initially hurt his right elbow making an awkward throw against Baltimore on July 24. Knoblauch's condition has not improved, and he was given a dye test yesterday, which club officials said confirmed an earlier diagnosis of inflammation. Knoblauch mentioned on Sunday that he has a tear.</p>
        <p>No matter what the exact nature of the injury, it could have serious consequences for the Yankees. Knoblauch has been a crucial member of the team, in spite of his throwing jitters, because he is such an effective leadoff hitter. The Yankees hope his condition can improve to the point that he can throw and play second base again. ''Hopefully, he can continue,'' Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, said.</p>
        <p>Knoblauch can still hit, in spite of his elbow trouble, and if he cannot play second base, then Torre may consider using him as the designated hitter. Until Knoblauch returns -- possibly the first week of September -- Jose Vizcaino will play second and share the leadoff spot.</p>
        <p>Derek Jeter led off yesterday. The Yankees took a 1-0 lead in the second inning when David Justice hit his 28th homer; he added another two innings later. But in the top of the sixth inning, with Seattle leading, 3-2, the Mariners rallied against Denny Neagle.</p>
        <p>With two outs and runners at first and second, Neagle got ahead of Rickey Henderson, no balls and two strikes. But Neagle eventually walked Henderson -- his critical mistake, Neagle would say later. The bases were loaded, the count went to three balls and two strikes on Carlos Guillen, and Neagle tried zipping a fastball over the outside corner.</p>
        <p>The right-handed-hitting Guillen poked the ball toward right field. Neagle was sure it was an easy fly to right fielder Paul O'Neill. But O'Neill ran toward the Stadium wall, hit the fence and watched Guillen's drive ride a swirling wind into the stands, just over the 314-foot sign in the right-field corner. Grand slam. Yankee Stadium will usually be a friend to Neagle, a fly ball pitcher, but this time it hurt him.</p>
        <p>''Any time anybody wraps something around the pole, there's really not a whole lot you can do about it,'' Torre said.</p>
        <p>Jason Grimsley relieved Neagle and nailed Edgar Martinez with a fastball, and Piniella patrolled the Seattle dugout, talking aloud. When Justice came to bat in the bottom of the sixth inning, Mariners pitcher John Halama threw a fastball behind Justice, clear retaliation.</p>
        <p>''The pitch got away from him,'' Piniella said later. ''Although Edgar did get hit the previous inning.''</p>
        <p>Halama said, ''Whatever Lou said stands for me.''</p>
        <p>Justice said later that he understood what Halama was trying to do, and that he had no problem with it. But Justice did turn and ask the umpire, Carlson, if he was going to give a warning to Halama, and became somewhat animated when Carlson said no. Before the next pitch, Justice stepped far back in the box, in anticipation of another brushback that never came.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, Justice was called out on strikes twice on pitches that appeared to be out of the strike zone. Justice never said Carlson retaliated for Justice's arguments, but it was apparent he felt that way. ''Y'all got TV,'' Justice said. ''Y'all saw it.''</p>
        <p>Glenallen Hill and Jorge Posada also hit home runs -- too little, on a frustrating afternoon for the Yanks.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>Manager JOE TORRE considered skipping DAVID CONE in the rotation this week, to give him additional rest after his 137-pitch start Saturday. But Cone threw in the bullpen yesterday and felt fine, and will start Thursday against Oakland's MARK MULDER. Cone was supposed to face KEVIN APPIER, but the Athletics altered their rotation. . . . The right-hander RAMIRO MENDOZA was examined by Dr. JAMES ANDREWS in Alabama yesterday and will resume treatment for stiffness in his arm. The Yankees hope Mendoza can return in September.</p>
