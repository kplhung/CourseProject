        <p>A headache without the head pain might sound contradictory, but the condition, described in a new journal article, could lend insights into an ailment known as the cluster headache.</p>
        <p>Doctors writing in yesterday's issue of Neurology described the case of a 22-year-old man who had all the symptoms of a cluster headache, except the pain.</p>
        <p>When he went to his doctor, he exhibited nasal stuffiness, a droopy eyelid and contraction of one of his pupils, all signs of the painful condition that affects about 1 in 1,000 people, mostly men.</p>
        <p>The patient said he suffered one to three attacks a day, each lasting an hour or two. After six weeks, the symptoms disappeared.</p>
        <p>But six years later, the article said, the man came back.</p>
        <p>This time, he had the same symptoms, but also severe pain that lasted 90 minutes, about twice a day.</p>
        <p>When he was treated with a drug used for cluster headaches, sumatriptan, the pain and most of his other symptoms went away.</p>
        <p>''This report may guide future cluster headache research in another direction,'' the author, Dr. Rolf Salvesen of the University of Tromso in Norway, said in a statement.</p>
        <p>His patient's condition offers evidence that tearing, congestion and drooping eye associated with cluster headaches are not, as many believed, a response to the pain, but symptoms in their own right.</p>
