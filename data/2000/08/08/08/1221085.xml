        <p>Omnipoint Communications, the mobile telephone carrier, has agreed to clarify advertising claims about customer access to its system and  the security of calls, according to the New York State attorney general, who had accused the company of misleading advertising.</p>
        <p>But Omnipoint said its agreement to settle the case was not an admission of any wrongdoing.</p>
        <p>The attorney general, Eliot L. Spitzer, had challenged the company's claim that its Global System for  Mobile Communications provided ''complete and total privacy.''He said that while calls within the system had a high level of security and were not susceptible to interception or electronic eavesdropping, this was not the case with calls made to or received from phones not on the system. He said such calls ''would not be completely secure'' because of encryption problems.</p>
        <p>As part of the settlement he announced yesterday, the company, recently bought by VoiceStream Wireless, agreed to ''clarify claims regarding the privacy or security of calls'' between its Global System mobile network and other systems, Mr. Spitzer said.</p>
        <p>He had also charged that the company ''failed to clearly disclose that service was not available in all areas where many customers would expect to use it,'' because they could not gain access to the Global System network from many areas of Long Island and Westchester. The company agreed to ''clearly disclose'' such limitations as well, Mr. Spitzer said. Omnipoint also agreed to pay $35,000 to cover the costs of the state investigation.</p>
