        <p>Samuel G Freedman Op-Ed article says Vice Pres Al Gore has shattered the enduring concept of American Jewish insecurity about courting anti-Semitism by naming as his running mate Sen Joseph Lieberman, first Jew ever on a major party's presidential ticket; notes Lieberman's adherence to Modern Orthodoxy, movement that believes in engaging with the larger society while remaining strictly observant; says Lieberman offers proof that a Jew in modern America need not diminish his faith as price of worldly achievement or consider such faith alone a replacement for the crucible of public life (M)</p>

        <p>In the midst of World War II, when my Uncle Seymour was about to have his bar mitzvah, my grandmother went to the rabbi of their Bronx synagogue with a request.

        <p>That the rabbi eagerly complied with this motherly meddling attests to more than the Jewish devotion to F.D.R. It served as a vivid reminder that even in tolerant America, even at a time of Nazi extermination abroad, most Jews depended on a righteous gentile like Roosevelt to protect them and their interests. To shout out on their own behalf, to draw attention to their tiny share of the American populace, was to court anti-Semitism.</p>
        <p>More than a half-century later, Al Gore has shattered the enduring concept of American Jewish insecurity by naming as his running mate Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, the first Jew ever on a major party's presidential ticket. And in ways he himself may not even understand, Mr. Gore has sent a powerful message by choosing a Jew who is Orthodox, and, more specifically, Modern Orthodox.</p>
        <p>For much of this century, the Jews who rose in government service or partisan politics tended to be of Reform belief and German ancestry. Herbert Lehman, Henry Morgenthau and Felix Frankfurter arose from a subculture of Jews who had shed much observance and ritual, who had embraced English liturgy as part of becoming American. All these men, in their way, were domestic equivalents of the shtadtlan of Eastern Europe's ghettos, the communal diplomats who pleaded the Jewish community's concerns to the crown.</p>
        <p>By now, so much has changed that a nation that is only 2 percent Jewish has elected 34 Jews to both houses of Congress. Yet even amid such company Mr. Lieberman stands out because of his public observance. He is not Sandy Koufax or Hank Greenberg, making a show of not playing ball on Yom Kippur while otherwise living a relatively nonreligious life. Mr. Lieberman worships at Kesher Israel, an Orthodox synagogue in Georgetown, and observes the 613 commandments, the mitzvot. If there is a vital session of Congress on the Sabbath, he still attends and votes, but he walks rather than drives.</p>
        <p>And recognizing that balance is essential to understanding Mr. Lieberman's significance in the world of American Jewry. The Modern Orthodox movement believes in the concept of Torah Umaddah -- literally ''Torah and worldly knowledge,'' but more broadly, the value of engaging with the larger society. It is precisely this style of Orthodoxy that has been whipsawed by two contradictory trends -- ever-increasing assimilation by less observant Jews and withering criticism by ultra-Orthodox Jews who view secular America as a spiritual pollutant that must be handled only to the extent necessary.</p>
        <p>It could be that Joseph Lieberman earned his place on Al Gore's ticket during the Monica Lewinsky scandal, when he rose in the Senate to despair over a president's conduct. From a purely pragmatic standpoint, that speech may help Mr. Gore distance himself from Mr. Clinton's personal behavior. Far more important, though, Mr. Lieberman's oration, suffused as it was with a religious man's sense of propriety, offered proof that a Jew in modern America need not diminish his faith as the price of worldly achievement or consider such faith alone a replacement for the crucible of public life.</p>
