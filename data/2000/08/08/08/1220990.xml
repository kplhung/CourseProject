        <p>For the second time in two years, Darryl Strawberry, the former Yankee slugger, underwent surgery yesterday to remove a cancerous tumor in his abdomen. The surgery marked the beginning of another and much tougher round in his fight against colon cancer, cancer experts said.</p>
        <p>Strawberry was in stable condition at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center last night after a team of four surgeons found and removed an ''isolated tumor mass'' near the left kidney, Myrna Manners, a spokeswoman for the hospital, said.</p>
        <p>''The physicians caring for Mr. Strawberry are optimistic for an uneventful recovery'' from surgery, Manners said.</p>
        <p>Strawberry's cancer was first discovered in early October 1998 as the Yankees were steamrolling toward the World Series. Surgeons operated on him Oct. 3, removing a 16-inch section of his colon and 36 lymph nodes. One of those lymph nodes tested positive for cancerous cells, suggesting the cancer had begun to spread through the lymphatic system. Strawberry underwent intensive chemotherapy for six months.</p>
        <p>Though Strawberry did play last season, he missed 113 days. Major League Baseball suspended him after he was arrested in Tampa, Fla., in April 1999 on charges of possessing cocaine and soliciting a prostitute. He returned to the Yankees on Sept. 1 and, over the last 24 games of the season, hit .327 with three home runs and six runs batted in, helping the team to its third World Series in four years.</p>
        <p>Less than two weeks ago, while Strawberry was serving a yearlong suspension for failing a drug test, a CAT scan revealed what appeared to be a cancerous growth in a lymph node near the site of his original tumor. Last week, tests at the Palms of Pasadena Hospital in Tampa confirmed the player's worst fears: the cancer had returned.</p>
        <p>In those tests, Jonathan D. LaPook, Strawberry's gastroenterologist, determined the cancer had spread into tissue next to the player's left kidney but appeared not to have recurred inside the colon itself.</p>
        <p>The surgeons -- Mitchell C. Benson, Geeorge J. Todd, Richard L. Whelan and Peter B. Schiff -- said after the operation that they believed they had removed all of the cancerous tissue, Manners said. It remained unclear what further treatment Strawberry would be given, but it is likely to include chemotherapy, oncologists said.</p>
        <p>''You trust the people who are taking care of you,'' Yankees Manager Joe Torre said. ''He has to be convinced he's in good hands. It's nice to have faith, too.''</p>
        <p>Despite the successful surgery, it will be an uphill battle for the former slugger. Harmon Eyre, the chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, said studies have shown that people who have a recurrence of colon cancer within two years have a 5 percent to 15 percent chance of survival.</p>
        <p>''He has a new baby,'' Torre said, ''and that's something that scares you the most.''</p>
        <p>Strawberry's odds may be slightly higher because he is relatively young at 38 years old and extremely strong, Eyre said. That means he can withstand stronger doses of chemotherapy and more extensive surgery than an older patient could.</p>
        <p>''The vast majority of people who have a recurrence of colon cancer die from it,'' Eyre said. ''It's not a good situation, but it's not totally hopeless either.''</p>
        <p>Though Strawberry has made millions as a ballplayer in the last 17 years, he has told reporters recently that he is in deep financial trouble. Strawberry, an eight-time All-Star, has five children from two marriages. He was put on baseball's ineligible list because he tested positive for cocaine on Feb. 28. It was the third time he had been suspended for cocaine use in his career. In March, he checked into a rehabilitation clinic in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.</p>
        <p>Two months ago, however, he left the clinic abruptly, telling counselors he needed to earn money. In late July, he asked Major League Baseball to reinstate him early. He also pursued a minor league contract with the St. Paul Saints in Minnesota.</p>
        <p>Strawberry has a career batting average of .259. He has hit 335 home runs and driven in 1,000 runs in 1,583 major league games with the Mets, the Los Angeles Dodgers, the San Francisco Giants and the Yankees. He was the National League Rookie of the Year with the Mets in 1983.</p>
        <p>Yet for all the promise he showed that year, Strawberry's career has been held back by numerous personal problems: twin addictions to alcohol and cocaine, injuries and charges of tax evasion and failure to pay child support.</p>
