        <p>Like a select number of other journalists covering the Gore campaign, Claire Shipman of NBC News received the official word yesterday about Senator Joseph I. Lieberman's selection as Vice President Al Gore's running mate before even Mr. Lieberman did.</p>
        <p>''I got the calls at 4:30 a.m., and we put together a package at 5 a.m.,'' said Ms. Shipman, who added that she had been working the phones for days. ''The deal was I was going to use it at 7 a.m. and not before.''</p>

        <p>Like a select number of other journalists covering the Gore campaign, Claire Shipman of NBC News received the official word yesterday about Senator Joseph I. Lieberman's selection as Vice President Al Gore's running mate before even Mr. Lieberman did.</p>
        <p>''I got the calls at 4:30 a.m., and we put together a package at 5 a.m.,'' said Ms. Shipman, who added that she had been working the phones for days. ''The deal was I was going to use it at 7 a.m. and not before.''</p>
        <p>At a few minutes to 7, Katie Couric, the co-host of ''Today,'' offered a tease about the news that would be elucidated at the top of the hour. The Associated Press put out an urgent bulletin, and the Gore campaign was off on a fast break with its hottest news day in months. By 7:01 or thereabouts, every major network and a variety of news-oriented Web sites were buzzing over Mr. Gore's choice of Mr. Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat, as his running mate.</p>
        <p>This, of course, was by no means an accident. In the wake of a Republican convention as tightly choreographed as a modern ballet, the Democrats were answering with a political announcement as finely plotted as a three-act whodunit. The aim, Democratic officials said, was to quell the postconvention Republican thunder with a pre-emptory saturation of news pages, Web sites and airwaves with the choice of Mr. Lieberman, a selection that allowed commentators to use words like ''bold'' and ''historic.''</p>
        <p>It was all intended to make a big splash before the Democratic convention next week, and to draw vivid contrasts between the ways in which Mr. Gore and Gov. George W. Bush picked their running mates -- as if to put forth the selection process as a metaphor for the kinds of administrations they would preside over. Mr. Gore's aides said that Mr. Bush's choice of Dick Cheney leaked out so haphazardly that the Bush campaign was made to look indecisive.</p>
        <p>''We were able to throw out information in a very controlled, businesslike fashion,'' said an official in the Gore campaign, ''while they lost control of the process very early on.''</p>
        <p>A commentator on MSNBC's ''Equal Time,'' Paul Begala, a former speechwriter and adviser to President Clinton, said that in an age when the press and the public try to deconstruct every television image, ''process is often message.''</p>
        <p>''A big part of Gore's message is that he is experienced and intelligent,'' Mr. Begala added. ''Nothing could prove it better than the way he handled this. He kept his own counsel, then he made his choice.''</p>
        <p>It was no accident, either, that the news was spread by the campaign 32 hours before the announcement by Mr. Gore at a rally today in Nashville that is to include a performance by the singer Jewel. The idea was to turn the news conference into something like political infotainment.</p>
        <p>''You're getting coverage all day today, all day tomorrow and getting a lot of coverage probably on Wednesday and Thursday,'' the Gore campaign official said. ''The pick is a historic pick, and you want to leverage something like this as much as you can.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney, having served as defense secretary during the Persian Gulf war, has a higher public profile than Mr. Lieberman, whom the Democrats essentially will have to introduce to a large percentage of American voters. Gore campaign aides said they needed to make sure that they got the first shot at ''defining'' Mr. Lieberman for the public.</p>
        <p>To that end, close advisers to Mr. Gore spent the wee hours yesterday lining up prominent Democrats to speak for Mr. Lieberman on morning and daytime news programs.</p>
        <p>''Basically, it's a situation where once the decision is made by the vice president, you have to be very aggressive to control the news,'' said another Gore aide.</p>
        <p>The Democrats have refined their ideas about managing the news in the years since 1984, when the last groundbreaking nominee, Geraldine A. Ferraro, was picked to run with former Vice President Walter F. Mondale. That year, said Martin Kaplan, who was Mr. Mondale's chief speechwriter at the time, Ms. Ferraro was flown overnight to Minnesota and appeared with Mr. Mondale the next morning, just as the story broke. The event pretty much spoke for itself.</p>
        <p>''It was one of the most dramatic moments I've ever been at,'' Mr. Kaplan said. ''There were tears in the eyes of some of the Secret Service people in the chamber.''</p>
