        <p>A few days earlier, Ms. Falco's ''Sopranos'' co-star Lorraine Bracco could also be found at a favorite sale of the well-dressed -- the semi-annual Manolo Blahnik clearance in Manhattan. There, frenzied women with size 7 feet convince themselves they can fit into a 6 so they can go home with pink and white mules at $150 a pair.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bracco, who had been on ''The View'' that day, was perusing the ''not on sale'' shelves when she came upon a pair for her character, Dr. Jennifer Melfi, psychologist to Tony Soprano. ''These are shrink shoes,'' she said as she inspected her feet in a pair of brown alligator pumps for $2,400. When a shopper pointed out that a shoe made from a reptile might offend a patient, Ms. Bracco said, ''I don't care in my own life, and I certainly don't care for my character.''</p>

        <p>But an HBO representative with her could not authorize the purchase without approval of the ''Sopranos'' costume designer, Juliet Polcsa.  Tobe Becker of HBO said yesterday that Ms. Polcsa hadn't been asked about the shoes. Do they represent Dr. Melfi? ''You'd think not,'' she said.</p>
