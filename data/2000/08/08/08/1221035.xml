        <p>While private industry spent millions to meet a 1998 federal deadline to upgrade leaking underground fuel tanks -- the nation's leading cause of ground water pollution -- state and local  government agencies continue to operate thousands of antiquated tanks in danger of leaking chemicals into water supplies, records show.</p>
        <p>Most private companies, from deep-pocketed oil conglomerates to  mom-and-pop gas retailers, upgraded their tanks before the December 1998 deadline to avoid stiff fines and negative publicity. But many governments, from New York State to the town hall in Cheshire, Conn., have taken advantage of lax enforcement standards to flout the deadline.</p>
        <p>''It's very tough making people do something like this, especially when  the political will isn't there,'' said Hal White, a technician with the Office of Underground Storage Tanks at the Environmental Protection Agency. ''What they really need is a  disaster.''</p>
        <p>Most outdated underground tanks are probably leaking fuel, either into  the soil, drinking-water wells or aquifers, said Tim Fields Jr., a Washington administrator in the E.P.A.'s solid waste and emergency response unit. Leaking fuel tanks have already tainted hundreds of wells in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, including more than 400 in New Jersey alone, according to a 1998 study by the agency. But leaking tanks are a nationwide problem. A 1998 study by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California found traces of a gasoline additive, MTBE, in more than 10,000 sites statewide.  Environmental groups complain that many other states, like Texas, have failed to adequately track leaks and punish tank owners.</p>
        <p>The full impact on ground water supplies from these old steel tanks, which become prone to leaks after about 10 years, will take years to gauge, environmental experts said.</p>
        <p>''It is certainly a long-term issue,'' said Lois Epstein, an environmental engineer with the Environmental Defense Fund in Washington. Most water can be made drinkable, she said, but added, ''There's no way to treat ground water to its precontamination state.''</p>
        <p>Roughly half the nation's population draws its drinking water, billions of gallons of it per day, from below-ground sources like public and private wells or aquifers. In 1984, recognizing the potential threat that  the old single-wall steel underground fuel tanks posed to the water supply,  Congress ordered the E.P.A. to establish a compliance program to remove or replace the tanks to protect against corrosion, spills and leaks.</p>
        <p>In 1988, the agency gave owners of the nation's three million or so underground storage tanks -- which  hold hazardous liquids, from gasoline to industrial solvents -- 10 years to either remove or upgrade them.</p>
        <p>The federal regulations covered underground tanks capable of holding at least 1,100 gallons; home heating oil tanks, which are generally  smaller, were exempt from federal law, though some states, including New York, regulate them.</p>
        <p>About 85 percent of the 750,000  storage tanks still in the ground nationwide were in compliance as of March, according to the E.P.A. Mr. Fields called the agency's tank-upgrade program ''a tremendous success story'' that has significantly reduced the amount of fuel trickling into the nation's soil and water.</p>
        <p>About 110,000 other tanks, including thousands in New York, New  Jersey and Connecticut, are being operated illegally, according to state records. ''A large portion of those would be leaking,'' Mr. Fields said.</p>
        <p>In most states, only a slight percentage of underground tanks are still operating illegally, according to the E.P.A. But in other states, compliance rates are either far lower or unknown. In Ohio, only 4,556 of the 29,177 active storage tanks were upgraded fully, according to March data provided by the state to the E.P.A. Texas, home to 62,600 storage tanks, more than New York and New Jersey combined, failed to report any data for the same period.</p>
        <p>Most industrial and private tank owners, particularly those in the highly competitive retail gasoline business, upgraded their tanks before the deadline because they knew they would be the first to be fined by the E.P.A., said John Huber, vice president of the Petroleum Marketers Association of America, a trade group based in Arlington, Va.</p>
        <p>Competition also helped spur compliance. ''If you own a gas station, and you know Joe down the street hasn't put up the $50,000 to clean up his tanks, you're calling'' state enforcement officials, he said.</p>
        <p>But state and federal enforcement officials took a more lenient approach with government-owned tanks, he said. ''If you're a state  E.P.A. inspector are you going to go around to the state police, or are you  going to check private citizens?'' Mr. Huber said. ''How smart would you look to be the one to shut down an ambulance's tanks?''</p>
        <p>State environmental officials said many government-owned tanks listed as being in violation of the deadline may actually be in compliance,  but that there is no way to know until they are inspected.</p>
        <p>In New York, several state agencies are operating a total of 350 tanks illegally, E.P.A. officials said. A spokeswoman for the state, Jennifer Post, disputed that number and said that only 74 state-owned tanks were out of compliance. New York City officials are negotiating the penalty amount the city must pay for operating 614 underground fuel tanks past the deadline, said Nina Habib-Spencer, an E.P.A. spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>In New Jersey, a state-managed database lists 440 tanks operated by public agencies and governmental bodies that are being used illegally.</p>
        <p>In Connecticut, the E.P.A. estimated that 100 to 300 water wells are tainted by gasoline additives. More than a quarter of the 2,027 underground fuel tanks listed as out of compliance by the State Department of Environmental Protection are owned by a town or city or the state itself, records show.</p>
        <p>Connecticut, like many other states, has about a dozen tank-related spills and leaks a year. In June, for instance, an upgraded fiberglass tank under an ExxonMobil station in Madison, Conn., leaked 6,000 gallons of gasoline over five days, contaminating local ground water.</p>
        <p>In early July, officials discovered 26,000 gallons of diesel fuel had  leaked from a tank under a truck stop in Southington, Conn.</p>
        <p>''A lot of times, it's not documented as to how much leaked,'' said Peter Zack, supervisor of Connecticut's underground storage tank leak-detection program. ''A lot of times it will show up in a river or stream.''</p>
        <p>Beyond contributing to soil and ground water contamination, the failures of city, county and state governments to upgrade underground storage tanks, has cost taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions, in the last two years.</p>
        <p>On July 9, 1999, for example, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority agreed to pay a $32,000 fine for allowing tanks under a South Bronx bus depot to leak 9,000 to 19,000 gallons of fuel, Ms. Habib-Spencer said.</p>
        <p>Since March, the E.P.A. has sought to collect a $37,221 fine from the State Department of Transportation for operating storage tanks that do not meet federal regulations.</p>
        <p>In Connecticut, at least 19 cities and towns, including Hartford, New  Haven, Waterbury and Danbury, have been fined or cited for fuel tank violations, including leaks that have contaminated rivers and ground water, said Scott Deshefy, one of four inspectors in charge of monitoring the 13,500 underground storage tanks in the state.</p>
        <p>Underground fuel tanks in New Jersey, the most densely populated state in the country, have tainted hundreds of private and public water wells, federal officials said.</p>
        <p>All state-owned tanks in New Jersey have been upgraded, said Kevin Kratina, chief of New Jersey's Bureau of Underground Storage Tanks. But in July 1997, the E.P.A. fined the New Jersey Transit Authority  $130,000 for failing to install leak protection equipment on tanks it had  at several sites around the state.</p>
        <p>Business owners have also been caught grossly out of compliance with the federal law. In New York City, the E.P.A. fined Gaseteria, a chain of gasoline stations, $360,000 for tank leaks. On Thursday, the  agency announced that it was seeking to fine Supervalue, a supermarket chain based in Spring Valley, N.Y., $261,595 for tank violations at four locations in northern New Jersey. On May 30, a federal judge ordered a gas station owner, Oliver Hill, to pay $4.75 million -- the largest fine ever imposed for tank violations -- for ignoring a 1995 E.P.A. order to clean up 10,000 gallons of gasoline that leaked from tanks under the Onondaga reservation in upstate New York.</p>
        <p>Forcing owners of underground fuel tanks to comply with regulations  has been difficult because there are too few inspectors, E.P.A. officials said, with enforcement left primarily  to individual states. But enforcing laws protecting ground water also has been complicated by politics, federal and state officials said.</p>
        <p>For example, in New York the  Legislature never passed a law giving the State Department of Environmental Conservation the power to enforce the E.P.A.'s tank-upgrade law, said John Kushwara, the chief of the E.P.A.'s regional unit on ground water compliance in New York City.  That means enforcement in New York is largely the job of the federal government, he said.</p>
        <p>But Washington politics has also hindered enforcement of the storage tank law, state and federal environmental officials said.</p>
        <p>For years, Congress has overseen a fund, collected from taxes paid by petroleum companies, to help states clean up large fuel spills caused by underground storage tanks. Though the fund, called the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund, currently has $1.3 billion in it, federal law permits the E.P.A. to draw only about $70 million a year, roughly the amount the fund earns in interest each year. That money can only be used to clean up spills, not to find and close leaking tanks or enforce the current tank-upgrade regulations, E.P.A. officials said.</p>
        <p>E.P.A. officials in Washington and petroleum industry executives said the law should be changed to free up more money and allow it to be used to detect fuel-tank problems before they erupt into disastrous spills.</p>
        <p>But federal and state environmental officials, as well as several petroleum industry executives, said Congressional leaders have refused to  touch the fund's $1.3 billion principal as part of the effort to reduce the federal deficit.</p>
        <p>Changing the law to allocate money for more enforcement action would go a long way toward better preventing ground water contamination, environmentalists said.</p>
        <p>''We really know a lot more about how to prevent this,'' said Ms. Epstein, the engineer with the Environmental Defense Fund. ''It's just a  matter of money, and it's a matter of will on the part of the owner-operators, and the agencies in charge of enforcement.''</p>
