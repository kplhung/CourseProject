        <p>A burglary suspect pulled a gun on security guards in an elevator of the Plaza Hotel last night, then ran out across Fifth Avenue firing at them until one shot him in the arm, the police said.</p>
        <p>The suspect, a middle-aged man in a navy blue suit, entered the hotel, a luxurious Midtown landmark, shortly after 9 p.m. and drew the notice of guards because he resembled a burglar whose photograph was on file, said Gary Schweikert, the general manager.</p>

        <p>A burglary suspect pulled a gun on security guards in an elevator of the Plaza Hotel last night, then ran out across Fifth Avenue firing at them until one shot him in the arm, the police said.</p>
        <p>The suspect, a middle-aged man in a navy blue suit, entered the hotel, a luxurious Midtown landmark, shortly after 9 p.m. and drew the notice of guards because he resembled a burglar whose photograph was on file, said Gary Schweikert, the general manager.</p>
        <p>Several security guards intercepted the man on the ninth floor, escorted him into an elevator and asked for identification, Mr. Schweikert said. As the elevator reached the first floor, the man withdrew a gun from his bag, said Detective John Giammarino, a police spokesman.</p>
        <p>Then the doors opened and the man fled out the north entrance of the hotel toward Central Park with four security guards in pursuit, Mr. Schweikert said. He could not recall a similar chase in the hotel's 93-year history.</p>
        <p>As the man ran, he turned and fired several times at the guards, Detective Giammarino said.</p>
        <p>Penny Crone, a reporter for WNYW, Channel 5, happened to be driving by with her 14-year-old son and a friend of his just as the gunfire proceeded across Grand Army Plaza, the street that runs parallel to Fifth Avenue just west of it.</p>
        <p>''We were passing one of those cows,'' one of hundreds of fiberglass cow sculptures placed around the city, she said breathlessly. ''And I said, 'Look at the cow,' and slowed down so the kids could see, and I see this guy with a gun shooting right in front of my car, with the doorman in his uniform from the Plaza chasing him and two other guys.'' Ms. Crone ordered the boys to duck to the floor of her Lincoln Navigator.</p>
        <p>At 60th Street and Fifth Avenue,  the man jumped into a cab and tried to escape, but the guards surrounded the car, Detective Giammarino said.</p>
        <p>The man opened the cab's door and fired point-blank at one of the guards, but missed, Mr. Schweikert said. At that point, the guard, a retired New York City police officer, returned fire and struck the man in the left arm, Mr. Schweikert said.</p>
        <p>The man was being treated at St. Clare's Hospital last night and had not been charged as of 12:30 this morning. Neither his name nor the guard's was immediately released. Mr. Schweikert did not know if the man was a suspect in any burglaries at the hotel.</p>
        <p>Half an hour after the chase, Plaza guests sat in the Palm Court -- about 40 feet from where the man had run by -- sipping tea and listening to a woman play the harp. It was as if the commotion had never happened.</p>
        <p>Outside, however, on the sweeping drive in front of the hotel, one guest wondered if she was safer on the street. ''I feel a little more comfortable over here,'' said the woman, Diana Schmidt, a saleswoman from Anthony, Kansas. ''I'm not really excited to go to my room by myself.''</p>
