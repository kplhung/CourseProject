        <p>Worried about the slow pace of financial reforms in South Korea and the stubbornly high debts of its big businesses and banks, President Kim Dae Jung replaced almost half of his 19-member cabinet today, including the nation's top economic officials.</p>
        <p>The changes, coming halfway through Mr. Kim's term of office, were almost entirely related to the performance of South Korea's economy, which has made a remarkable recovery since the severe economic crisis that began nearly three years ago but lately has been showing signs of increased stress.</p>

        <p>Worried about the slow pace of financial reforms in South Korea and the stubbornly high debts of its big businesses and banks, President Kim Dae Jung replaced almost half of his 19-member cabinet today, including the nation's top economic officials.</p>
        <p>The changes, coming halfway through Mr. Kim's term of office, were almost entirely related to the performance of South Korea's economy, which has made a remarkable recovery since the severe economic crisis that began nearly three years ago but lately has been showing signs of increased stress.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kim selected the new cabinet members based on what his spokesman, Park Joon Young, called the degree of ''reform-mindedness and expertise, under the belief that we must gain national competitiveness and enter the ranks of advanced nations in the 21st century.''</p>
        <p>The cabinet shuffle is the second in seven months. Mr. Kim replaced nine ministers in January, ahead of the national election in April.</p>
        <p>The most significant change in the cabinet today was the appointment of Jin Nyum, 59, who had been serving as planning and budget minister, charged with privatizing the nation's state-run companies, as the new minister of finance and economy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jin replaced Lee Hun Jai, who had been appointed in the last cabinet shuffle. Mr. Lee has been criticized for the slow progress in reducing debts at banks and major business groups and in reducing control by the founding family members of powerful business conglomerates.</p>
        <p>''After implementing the first round of corporate and financial reforms, the government failed to play a strict supervisory role,'' said Nam Jooha, a professor of finance and economy at Sogang University. ''That has led to fears of another economic crisis.''</p>
        <p>Before his tenure as finance minister, Mr. Lee was head of the Financial Supervisory Commission, which has been overseeing the restructuring of business conglomerates and financial institutions.</p>
        <p>During the early stages of the government's reform drive shortly after the economic crisis in late 1997, Mr. Lee's strict enforcement of the government's corporate restructuring plans won him praise from the foreign business community.</p>
        <p>The most high-profile sign that the previous cabinet had not been dealing effectively with South Korea's economic problems was its struggle with the Hyundai Group, the nation's largest business group. Hyundai has resisted efforts to get the conglomerate's founder, Chung Ju Yung, and his family to loosen controlling stakes in their industrial empire. Despite continued government pressure and threats from banks to seek immediate repayment of huge loans, the Hyundai Group has yet to produce a plan that promises a reduction of Mr. Chung's stake to levels acceptable to the government.</p>
        <p>''I think in the past there has been a tendency for confrontation,'' said James Rooney, former president and chief executive of the Templeton Trust Investment Management Company in South Korea. ''I think Jin Nyum is known for being more conciliatory. There will be more cajoling and encouragement.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jin had served as the chairman of the Planning and Budget Commission since 1998 and became minister in May last year, when the commission was raised in status to a ministry. He also served as the court-appointed manager of the Kia Motors Corporation in 1997, and was responsible for rescuing that automaker from a financial crisis.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Jin vowed ''to achieve concrete results within five months to a year,'' investors did not seem impressed with his appointment. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index, a barometer of the country's economic mood, fell 4.85 percent.</p>
        <p>The new cabinet faces a difficult task. Despite South Korea's efforts to  clean up its bad debts and untangle decades of murky finances among business conglomerates, domestic banks are still struggling with billions of dollars of unpaid loans.</p>
        <p>The international debt ratings company, Standard &amp; Poor's, said recently that the government would have to spend about $126 billion, or one-third of South Korea's gross domestic product, to clean up the bad debts in its financial industry.</p>
        <p>The president also replaced Lee Yong Keun, the chairman of the Financial Supervisory Commission, which oversees the restructuring of business groups and banks.</p>
        <p>The newly appointed chairman of the commission is Lee Keun Young, 63, chairman of the state-run Korea Development Bank.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lee also spent 20 years in the finance ministry's tax division and is credited with playing an important role in the dismantling of Daewoo Group, once South Korea's second-largest conglomerate, which owes creditors at least $80 billion.</p>
