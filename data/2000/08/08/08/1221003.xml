        <p>Regardless of political leanings or depth of spirituality, American Jews expressed great pride yesterday that one of their own, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, had been picked by Vice President Al Gore to be his running mate.</p>
        <p>They were proud, they said, not only that a Jew had made it into the highest echelons of United States politics. Their pride was also in America itself, for having reached a point that it could accept the possibility of a Jew -- and an Orthodox Jew at that -- being a proverbial heartbeat from the presidency.</p>

        <p>Regardless of political leanings or depth of spirituality, American Jews expressed great pride yesterday that one of their own, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, had been picked by Vice President Al Gore to be his running mate.</p>
        <p>They were proud, they said, not only that a Jew had made it into the highest echelons of United States politics. Their pride was also in America itself, for having reached a point that it could accept the possibility of a Jew -- and an Orthodox Jew at that -- being a proverbial heartbeat from the presidency.</p>
        <p>''It reflects a coming of age and maturity, both for American Jewry and our political system,'' said Gary Rosenblatt, editor of The Jewish Week, a newspaper in New York.</p>
        <p>For some Jews, pride was tempered by concern that having a Jew in a position of such prominence might set off an anti-Semitic backlash or, at the least, feelings of unease among other Americans. Indeed, political chat rooms on the Internet focused on the Lieberman designation all day yesterday, and many of the comments were rawly anti-Semitic.</p>
        <p>By 6 p.m., an America Online message board set up to discuss Mr. Lieberman had more than 14,000 postings, compared with 2,000 messages on a similar board created after Gov. George W. Bush named Dick Cheney his running mate. At times yesterday, anti-Semitic slurs and other offensive language made up half the conversations.</p>
        <p>But many Jews, including the leaders of major Jewish groups, said that although anti-Semitism remained an inescapable fact of life, it was waning in this country and had been pushed far from the political and social mainstream.</p>
        <p>Rabbi Ismar Schorsch, chancellor of the Jewish Theological Seminary in Manhattan, called Mr. Gore's selection of Mr. Lieberman ''a historic step forward in the complete integration of Jews in American society.'' But Rabbi Schorsch added that it was perhaps an inevitable step, given the fact that Jews were already highly visible in the upper reaches of American life, from corporate boardrooms to the United States Senate and even the president's Cabinet.</p>
        <p>''I think this nomination just confirms the status of Jews in American society,'' he said. ''It's not a breakthrough. It's a confirmation.''</p>
        <p>And it is a development, he and others said, that will ultimately benefit members of other minorities  whose presence on the national tickets of the major political parties had been virtually unthinkable.</p>
        <p>''It's a very special day not only for the Jewish people,'' said Elie Wiesel, winner of the 1986 Nobel Peace Prize and chronicler of the Holocaust. ''Now the political system is open to all men and women, of all ethnic origins.''</p>
        <p>Inevitably, perhaps, there were expressions of uncertainty about a Jew's rising so close to the top. This concern is often summed up in a question that is at once self-mocking and sincere: is it good for the Jews?</p>
        <p>This attitude was reflected in the comments yesterday of Shlomo Singer, 33, who lives in the Borough Park neighborhood of Brooklyn, a section of New York City inhabited largely by Hasidic Jews.</p>
        <p>''When Jews are too visible, it's bad news,'' Mr. Singer said. ''The Jews have to remember that they're in a diaspora and that they have no business running politics.''</p>
        <p>To some degree, attitudes like that are ''sort of hard-wired into our system, for better or worse,'' said Rabbi Avi Shafran, director of public affairs for Agudath Israel of America, an Orthodox group in New York.</p>
        <p>''But at the same time, it is leavened with pride,'' Rabbi Shafran said, and others agreed with him that feelings of apprehension were not nearly as strong, or as widely held, as they used to be.</p>
        <p>To the contrary, some Jewish leaders saw Mr. Lieberman's ascension as an opportunity to show Americans that Orthodox Judaism is a diverse world and not solely the province of bearded men in black attire.</p>
        <p>''At the end of the campaign, I'd be very surprised if the picture of the Orthodox Jew, active in his religion but also very much part of this world, hasn't been elevated in the eyes of Americans,'' said Dr. Mandell I. Ganchrow, president of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America.</p>
        <p>Not all Jews were delighted by the appointment. Among them was Rabbi Michael Lerner, editor of Tikkun, a liberal magazine on Jewish affairs. ''Rather than championing dramatic escalations in spending for social purposes and to end poverty and oppression, he will champion defense spending,'' Rabbi Lerner said.</p>
        <p>On the Jewish right, many disapprove of the senator's support of abortion and gay rights and are unhappy that he has not supported calls for freeing Jonathan J. Pollard, the American Jew in prison for spying for Israel.</p>
        <p>But in the end, the dominant feeling among Jews was that they had arrived. ''For everything there is a time,'' said Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League, ''and this is the time for a Joe Lieberman.''</p>
