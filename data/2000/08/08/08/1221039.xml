        <p>DURING a round of golf in the summer of 1995, Jerry West and Rick Pitino were discussing a kid who was going into his senior year in high school in Pennsylvania. Pitino, then coach of Kentucky, said he was determined to recruit the kid. West, the executive vice president of the Los Angeles Lakers, said: ''Forget about it, Rick. He's going pro right out of high school. And we're going to get him.''</p>
        <p>Unlike today, star high school basketball players were not often considering the direct jump to the National Basketball Association. ''C'mon, Jerry, he'll go to college for a year or two at least, to get experience,'' Pitino said.

        <p>DURING a round of golf in the summer of 1995, Jerry West and Rick Pitino were discussing a kid who was going into his senior year in high school in Pennsylvania. Pitino, then coach of Kentucky, said he was determined to recruit the kid. West, the executive vice president of the Los Angeles Lakers, said: ''Forget about it, Rick. He's going pro right out of high school. And we're going to get him.''</p>
        <p>Unlike today, star high school basketball players were not often considering the direct jump to the National Basketball Association. ''C'mon, Jerry, he'll go to college for a year or two at least, to get experience,'' Pitino said. West disagreed, saying, ''Not only will he go pro right away, but he's going to be one of the greatest players in the history of the game.''</p>
        <p>Pitino recalled: ''I thought Kobe Bryant would probably be an N.B.A player one day. And maybe even excel. But at that time, to think he'd be one of the best of all time was quite a leap. But West saw something that I didn't see, and that many others didn't see. But that's Jerry West.''</p>
        <p>Not only did Jerry West have an eye for the basket, as one of the greatest players in the history of the game, but he also had a remarkable eye for talent.</p>
        <p>''He loved to scout,'' said Jerry Krause, general manager of the Chicago Bulls. ''I'd be there with him on the road, and it's late at night and you're watching your fourth, your fifth, your sixth game of the day. I've never known a great ex-player who was a great general manager -- who would spend that kind of time at details -- other than Jerry West. He just had a passion for building a team, and he was also a master of the salary cap. Remember the trade he made with Vancouver, two expensive players for two draft choices, opened up the cap so he could afford Shaquille O'Neal.''</p>
        <p>Now Jerry West, age 62 -- who, over two decades, was the architect of numerous Laker championship teams, from Kareem and Magic to O'Neal and that young first-team N.B.A. All-Star player, Kobe Bryant -- announced yesterday that he was retiring.</p>
        <p>Maybe, as he has said, it's just time for him to be ''unburdened of the pressures.'' Maybe he indeed was just burned out; it had reached the point where he couldn't sit through Laker home games but had to pace about in an exit ramp. In the Lakers' final game last June which gave them the N.B.A. title, he motored along the freeways and had a friend telephone him with updates on the game.</p>
        <p>Maybe, as some have speculated, the new coach, Phil Jackson, has gained more control of the team than makes West comfortable.</p>
        <p>Or, as others contend, West felt that Jerry Buss, the Lakers' owner, had never shown sufficient respect for his achievements by offering him a piece of the team. At this last championship celebration in Los Angeles, West, for whatever reason, was conspicuous by his absence. (After 40 distinguished years in an organization, one may cut him slack on a snit.)</p>
        <p>But for many, the image of West the executive fades to West the player. The first time I saw him in person, in Chicago Stadium in 1958, he was an all-American with West Virginia. Despite a cast covering a broken (nonshooting) left wrist, his sweet-as-marmalade jumpers and knifelike drives staggered a superb Northwestern team.</p>
        <p>Krause recalled the 1965 playoff series between Baltimore -- Krause was then a Bullets executive -- and Los Angeles: ''The Lakers were Elgin Baylor, West and three other average guys. Baylor got hurt after five minutes of the first game and missed the rest of the series. West took it upon himself to carry the team. He was unbelievable.'' West, who averaged 31 points a game during the regular season, averaged 46 in that series, scoring 49, 52, 44, 48, 43, and 42 points as the Lakers beat the Bullets in six games.</p>
        <p>Off the court, West was invariably candid and thoughtful, and, it seemed, always wore the same size fedora regardless of his accomplishments. Near the end of the 1974 season, West announced his retirement as a player. ''I've enjoyed the camaraderie of teammates, and I'll miss that a lot,'' he told me then. ''But right now I feel like just going somewhere where there is no basketball and there is no coach running my life. But I'll probably miss that, too, after about a week.''</p>
        <p>In one respect, though, West will still be around. The N.B.A. logo of the graceful dribbler silhouetted in red, white and blue was taken from a long-ago photo of West.</p>
        <p>For those of us who have enjoyed Jerry West in his various careers, we hope, as he reckoned 26 years ago, that he'll be back in basketball in a week.</p>
