        <p>Joseph A Small Jr letter on Aug 1 article on Lasik procedure to correction vision problems; favors co-management of procedure by optometrist and surgeon</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I weigh in on the side of ''co-management'' between an optometrist and eye surgeon as discussed in ''Laser Eye Surgery's Turf War.'' I first discussed Lasik with my optometrist of 12 years several months ago. It made perfect sense to start this dialogue with someone  familiar with my vision history.  One criterion in assessing a Lasik candidate is nondeteriorating vision for a couple of years before the procedure. Who would know better than my optometrist?</p>
        <p>In response to my inquiry, my optometrist gave me an objective and complete discussion of Lasik: pros, cons, risks, side effects, expectations. I was shown a video further explaining the procedure. I was not subjected to a hard sell. I was told of his alliance with an ophthalmologist but was also encouraged to shop around.</p>

        <p>I had the surgery six weeks ago and am satisfied with the results and my treatment before and after.  My optometrist performed all pre- and post-operative care, and I met the surgeon only the afternoon of the procedure. But I was fully briefed before, during and after, and I was offered complete access to the ophthalmologist if necessary.</p>
        <p>I'll trust that arrangement over billboards and radio ads every time. Now, where did I put those blasted reading glasses . . .</p>
