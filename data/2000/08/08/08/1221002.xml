        <p>Julie Krone began in Michigan as a barefoot 5-year-old bareback aboard Stony Baloney, whom she called her Wonder Pony. As an 18-year-old, she hopped a fence at Tampa Bay Downs to take out her first jockey license.

        <p>None of it came easily. Krone had to convince owners that a woman possessed the physical strength to handle a 1,000-pound thoroughbred and the mental ballast to recognize and take opportunities at 35 miles an hour.

        <p>Julie Krone began in Michigan as a barefoot 5-year-old bareback aboard Stony Baloney, whom she called her Wonder Pony. As an 18-year-old, she hopped a fence at Tampa Bay Downs to take out her first jockey license. She won riding titles in New Jersey and Florida, and 119 stakes races in every important hub of horse racing, and became the first and only female jockey to win a Triple Crown event when she coaxed Colonial Affair home in the 1993 Belmont Stakes.</p>
        <p>None of it came easily. Krone had to convince owners that a woman possessed the physical strength to handle a 1,000-pound thoroughbred and the mental ballast to recognize and take opportunities at 35 miles an hour. There were scrapes with male jocks and two bone-jarring spills that could have snuffed out her career.</p>
        <p>Now 37 and retired, the 4-foot-11-inch Krone faced one more obstacle before she became the first woman to be inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. She overcame that, too, by stepping up on a milk crate to reach the microphone on the podium to deliver her acceptance speech.</p>
        <p>''I wish I could put every single one of you on the back of a horse at the one-eighth pole,'' she said, ''so you could have the feeling of communicating with an animal you love so much. I got to do that every day of my life.''</p>
        <p>She entered the Hall of Fame in impeccable company. The sport's great past was invoked by the welcoming of the 1956 Kentucky Derby winner, Needles. The museum's historic review committee also announced that Tom Smith, the trainer who campaigned Seabiscuit in the 1930's, was elected posthumously to the Hall of Fame and would be inducted next August. Racing's current glory was reflected in the inductions of the trainer Neil Drysdale and his horse A. P. Indy, as well as of Winning Colors, who became only the third filly to win the Kentucky Derby in 1988.</p>
        <p>''I want this to be a lesson to all kids everywhere,'' Krone said today. ''If the stable gate is closed, climb the fence.''</p>
        <p>Drysdale was presented by Peggy Whittingham, the widow of the Hall of Fame trainer Charlie Whittingham, whom he had apprenticed under before going out on his own to train five champions, including A. P. Indy, and guiding Fusaichi Pegasus to victory in this year's Kentucky Derby. The 52-year-old Drysdale, a native of Britain, conservative and concise, offered a brief but poignant acceptance speech.</p>
        <p>''My career would not be possible without a very forgiving clientele tolerating me, and a very understanding and loyal staff,'' he said. ''But most of all, these lovely four-legged creatures that have given my life such passion.''</p>
        <p>Still, Krone was the most galvanizing inductee in the class, prompting much discussion in the racing community over whether she had the statistical heft to deserve election. She amassed an accomplished record, winning 3,545 races -- or 17 percent of her mounts -- for earnings of $81.8 million, which are records for female jockeys. But the rider she beat on the ballot, Earlie Fires, for example, won more than 6,000 races, and current riders in the Hall Of Fame like Jerry Bailey and Pat Day have won more than 4,600 and 7,600 races, respectively.</p>
        <p>But the trainers who trusted Krone on horses have been the most vocal about her worthiness. She won the Belmont aboard Colonial Affair for Scotty Schulhofer, giving them both their first victory in a Triple Crown race.</p>
        <p>''I was a little leery about her being a girl,'' Schulhofer conceded. ''But when I saw her on a horse for me firsthand, I could see she was a great little horsewoman. She's got great finesse, beautiful hands on a horse, and good communication. You don't have to bully a horse -- just talk to him.''</p>
        <p>As her loud and warm ovation demonstrated, Krone is beloved throughout racing for her effervescent personality and high-pitched voice. In her heartfelt and often rambling speech, she told how the Hall of Fame rider Angel Cordero Jr. used to tease her about how she patiently waited on a horse until the stretch and one furious run. Cordero would compare her to Day. From atop the milk crate, she mimed the laid-back seat she would take on a horse and chirped, ''Angel used to say that if me and Pat Day had a baby, we'd go to give it a bottle of milk and that baby would say, 'No, no, you have to wait an hour.' ''</p>
        <p>In 1989, Krone was the nation's third-leading jockey with 368 victories and was in demand as a rider. If not for two serious spills, she might still be piling up numbers today. In 1993, on the last day of the Saratoga meet, she shattered her ankle after being tossed to the turf by the filly Seattle Way. She returned nine months later, but she was more fragile of body and mind. In 1995, she had finger surgery after an accident at Gulfstream Park in Florida.</p>
        <p>This time her rehabilitation also encompassed counseling and prescription medication after post-traumatic stress disorder was diagnosed. Krone returned to racing in 1997 and rode well at Monmouth Park, but she decided in 1999 that injuries had diminished her skills and eroded her determination.</p>
        <p>''There's nothing better than getting a second chance and coming back and doing it right,'' she acknowledged, thanking the trainers like Jonathan Sheppard, who presented her here, who had stuck with her.</p>
        <p>Afterward, Krone shrugged off the second-guessing of her Hall of Fame status. She pulled on the lapel of her blue blazer with the Hall of Fame insignia. ''Go cast a net over 500 people in the grandstand and see what they say,'' she said. ''From the personal response I have received, I think most people believe I belong.''</p>
        <p>FINISH LINES</p>
        <p>The trainer NEIL DRYSDALE said the Kentucky Derby winner Fusaichi Pegasus has been kept in racing shape with continual gallops, while his owners try to negotiation a stallion deal. He said Fusaichi Pegasus, the 3-year-old son of Mr. Prospector, would race again, but didn't say which races he would run in the fall. . . . The New York-bred Turnofthecentury held off the late charge of Aldo to capture the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame Handicap on Monday. The gray colt paid $9.80 for a $2 bet to win and earned a $90,000 purse for the owners BARRY K. SCHWARTZ and EUGENE HAUMAN.</p>
