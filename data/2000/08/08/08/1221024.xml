        <p>Henry Blodget's words used to add rocket fuel to the new economy. Yesterday, Mr. Blodget, Merrill Lynch's star Internet analyst, re-entered the atmosphere, downgrading 10 of the 29 companies he recommends.</p>
        <p>''We are resetting the investment ratings for our Internet universe,'' Mr. Blodget wrote in a report. Four months after the start of the April bloodbath that halted the Internet's unfettered charge, one of the most reliable of Internet bulls is finally showing signs of doubt.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blodget, 34, is considered one of the Internet sector's two premier analysts, along with Mary Meeker of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. Last month, Ms. Meeker showed a speck of caution when she raised her loss-per-share estimates for Amazon.com, but she stopped short of a downgrade. Mr. Blodget has countered with a raft of downgrades, but yesterday they barely registered across the sector.</p>
        <p>TheStreet.com Internet index gained 4.07 percent, and several names Mr. Blodget downgraded surged forward. Why? Maybe because of how far they have already fallen. The analyst, who once led the market up, now appears to be following it down.</p>
        <p>This has not been a banner year for Mr. Blodget, even by the recent anemic standards of Internet investors. Of the 29 stocks he covers, 11 of the companies are new to the group this year. The other 18 stocks, which he has covered all year, are down an average of 54.2 percent in 2000.</p>
        <p>TheStreet.com Internet index is down 33.8 percent over the same period. Since April, Internet mutual funds have been entrenched as the worst performing among all domestic fund categories.</p>
        <p>Comparing an analyst's picks to a mutual fund has its flaws, but it can be useful for a rough picture.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blodget's average return ranks behind even the worst-performing domestic mutual fund, Jacob Internet, down 51.4 percent.</p>
        <p>Only one of his 18 picks, Inktomi, has gained this year. Six have lost more than 70 percent of their value. EToys has lost 84.3 percent.</p>
        <p>''The market is no longer giving some companies the benefit of the doubt,'' said Mr. Blodget in an interview. ''We're acknowledging that. The sector is so volatile that it's made some of the ratings meaningless.''</p>
        <p>Figuring heavily into the ''resetting'' of Mr. Blodget's downgraded names were e-commerce stocks. Perhaps the fact that TheStreet.com E-Commerce index had already fallen 65.5 percent for the year when the day began meant that there was not much more room for the group to tumble. Some did fall. Buy.com dropped by 16.1 percent. Others soared. Doubleclick, the Internet advertising firm, gained 9.8 percent after Mr. Blodget's downgrade. iVillage, the beleaguered portal aimed at women that Mr. Blodget downgraded to accumulate from accumulate/buy, gained 4.8 percent. And Barnesandnoble.com soared 38.4 percent after it struck a deal with Microsoft to create an online store for digital books.</p>
        <p>Another factor could be that Mr. Blodget's report was far from a stark reappraisal of the sector's prospects.</p>
        <p>''The purpose of the reset is not to make a new 'call' on the direction of the group,'' the report said, ''but to provide a more precise differentiation of our current opinions (by using a wider range of ratings.)''</p>
        <p>For those who actually followed his recommendations, it might come as cold comfort that Mr. Blodget has decided to add a new word to his lexicon of ratings. Before yesterday, his ratings have all been combinations of one of two words, either ''buy'' or ''accumulate,'' which is more tepid than a buy recommendation.</p>
        <p>Now Mr. Blodget has added the word ''neutral'' to his repertoire. Previously, none of the 29 Internet stocks Mr. Blodget covered merited a neutral rating. Neutral, according to Merrill Lynch, means that it is not clear when a company will be profitable and that ''significant uncertanties or reservations remain.'' In plain English -- though analysts rarely admit as much -- it is roughly analagous to a ''thumbs down'' from Roger Ebert.</p>
        <p>''I think he's trying to say, 'Look, there are a handful of companies that are going to be stellar. Those are the Yahoos and AOL's and maybe Inktomi,' '' said James Houlton, manager of the Strong Internet fund.</p>
        <p>So which companies picked up the neutral rating? Yesterday, eToys, the online toy seller, was downgraded from an accumulate/buy rating to neutral. Barnesandnoble.com fared slightly better, downgraded from accumulate/buy rating to neutral/buy.</p>
        <p>''What is focused on now is profitability,'' said Mr. Blodget. ''I think we have been very vocal about the stage of the industry's development. We suggested as far back as last July that this was going to a rough time.''</p>
        <p>In December of 1998, when the Internet was still something of a novelty item, Mr. Blodget predicted Amazon.com would climb to $400 a share. His prediction made him the butt of jokes in some quarters, until Amazon hit $400 a few weeks later.</p>
        <p>Soon after, Mr. Blodget left his job at CIBC Oppenheimer for a blue chip post at Merrill Lynch. His picks became a guide for some investors looking for a roadmap to the new economy. This year, the road has become less travelled.</p>
        <p>''In an emerging sector like this,'' he said, ''you are going to make mistakes picking stocks.''</p>
