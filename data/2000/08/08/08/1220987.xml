        <p>When Frank Wallis flips one coin, it is a quarter if it lands on heads and a dollar if it comes up tails.</p>
        <p>That gold-colored coin has the back of a new Sacagawea dollar but the front of a quarter, and it  could bring Mr. Wallis thousands of dollars at a Philadelphia auction that begins tomorrow. Such coins, with an incorrect striking on one face, are called mules, just like hybrid animals, and they are rare. And coins with two denominations are so rare that none are known to have previously been struck by the Mint since it began its work 208 years ago.</p>
        <p>Mint officials have been closemouthed about the mistake, although acknowledging that one did happen. Coin experts have speculated that the only way such a misstrike could have occurred was that a Mint worker replaced a Sacagawea obverse die with an obverse quarter die. The result is a Sacagawea coin whose back correctly shows a soaring eagle but whose front, rather than depicting the Indian woman who served as a guide for the Lewis and Clark expedition, instead shows the quarter's familiar profile of Washington.</p>
        <p>This is the first year of minting Sacagawea dollars, and more than 800 million of them have  been struck so far. Thousands of misstruck coins may have been produced before the error was detected. The flawed coins were probably then destroyed, but a few got into general circulation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wallis, of Mountain Home, Ark., discovered the first such mule in a roll of Sacagawea dollars he bought at a local bank in late May. The discovery was first reported, on June 27, by Numismatic News, whose managing editor, David C. Kranz, says that ''four of them have now been found, and a fifth is rumored.''</p>
        <p>Of the known four, one was sold on eBay for $41,395. Two others,  one of them Mr. Wallis's, are being auctioned this week in Philadelphia, at the annual convention of the American Numismatic Association.</p>
        <p>While those two coins are expected to bring thousands of dollars, subsequent finds will diminish the rarity and thus the value of the entire batch. But a one-dollar investment will still have brought a substantial return.</p>
