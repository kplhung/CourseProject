        <p>Want to watch public relations executives from the nation's biggest communications companies become uncomfortable? Ask them about their unions.</p>
        <p>''Under the current circumstances I think our executives would rather stay out of this, so we're going to decline to get involved in this story,'' Burke Stinson, an AT&amp;T spokesman, said yesterday, the second full day of a strike by more than 86,000 union workers at Verizon Communications.</p>
        <p>Or ask Mark Bonavia, a spokesman for the Sprint Corporation. ''We decline to discuss the issue,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Or Joe Chandler, a spokesman for the BellSouth Corporation, which has 52,000 union employees out of 99,000 total. ''The people who are closest to this, it's going to be difficult for them to be out front on this right now, so you're stuck with me.''</p>
        <p>Even at Worldcom Inc., which has fewer than 500 union workers among its 75,000 employees, the subject is officially out of bounds. ''We just have a policy that we don't talk about these issues,'' said Peter Lucht, a Worldcom spokesman.</p>
        <p>For companies that spend millions of dollars lobbying regulators, buying advertising and trying to influence members of the media -- not to mention having communications as their core business -- why the sudden laryngitis?</p>
        <p>Because the unspoken secret is that the established communications carriers that still have unions basically wish that they did not. And the younger companies that do not have them will do just about anything to keep them away.</p>
        <p>''All else being equal, would it make our life easier if there were no union? Of course,'' said an executive at a large communications carrier, on condition of anonymity. ''But we do, so we just have to deal with it, and it's very delicate.''</p>
        <p>It is delicate because of fear, in particular fear of the Communications Workers of America. But the bald fact is that a preponderance of the communications companies that have had the best financial performance over the last decade (Worldcom, for instance) have not had the significant union presence of many of the industry's laggards (AT&amp;T and the former Bell company Nynex, which is now part of Verizon).</p>
        <p>To acknowledge this is not to say that unionization is prima facie bad for a communications company. It may just be that the communications carriers that have had the strongest and most powerful unions have happened to be in the weakest strategic position, or have had sub-par management or have been plain unlucky.</p>
        <p>And it may be that, down the road, companies with loyal unionized work forces will fare better than even nonunion companies in hotly contested growth businesses like wireless communications and high-speed Internet access -- markets where the ability to provide a reliable network and professional customer service may matter more to customers than providing the lowest-cost product.</p>
        <p>But there is a reason Verizon, the local phone behemoth formed by Bell Atlantic's acquisition of the GTE Corporation, has been willing to tolerate a strike by tens of thousands of its workers as it negotiates a new contract with the C.W.A. There is a reason the company has been fighting to keep its fast-growing wireless and Internet operations union free.</p>
        <p>That reason is that the company, rightly or wrongly, appears to believe that unions put it at some disadvantage. And at least some investors and financial analysts agree.</p>
        <p>This is Business 101. Few companies of any kind welcome unions. But what makes the issue more important for the big old communications companies is that they are battling well-financed competitors in various niches of their business -- especially wireless and data communications -- that have little or no union presence at all. So as the growth in the communications business continues to shift to those niches, those big old companies, each in turn, could find themselves fighting this same battle.</p>
        <p>On condition of anonymity, one Wall Street analyst said yesterday that if Verizon's wireless operation were completely unionized, it could cost the unit $300 million in additional annual expense. That money probably means a lot more to Verizon's workers than it does to the company; some analysts are expecting that same wireless unit to generate $5.5 billion or more of cash flow this year. So in the overall financial scheme, unionization may not be that big a deal.</p>
        <p>But there are other factors that matter.</p>
        <p>''If you're unionized,'' said John M. Bensche, a wireless communications analyst for Lehman Brothers, ''you have less flexibility in terms of hiring and firing people. And when you're growing this fast and want to shift resources around in a company, that can matter. For example, you might see a company move an entire collections department over to customer activation at Christmas time because it's really busy. And you might have to ask whether they could do that if they were unionized.''</p>
        <p>Verizon and the other Bell companies in particular have become very familiar with union work rules (and, some might say, the ways around them). The issue they face is that the unions can use their leverage over the companies' core business -- providing local telephone service -- to try to pry open new business units that had not been unionized.</p>
        <p>But that leverage does not exist at, say, VoiceStream Communications, an upstart wireless company that has agreed to be acquired by Deutsche Telekom and that has virtually no union presence. Even at Sprint, only 10,500 of the company's 78,000 workers are unionized, almost all of them in Sprint's local phone business -- not long-distance, not wireless and Internet access.</p>
        <p>MCI, the long-distance carrier that spent years battling the unions, was acquired in 1998 by Worldcom. And Bernard J. Ebbers, Worldcom's chief executive, has been loath to deal with unions. The fewer than 500 of the combined MCI-Worldcom's 75,000 employees who are unionized are affiliated with the Teamsters, not the C.W.A. (Perhaps not coincidentally, the unions were big opponents of Worldcom's proposed acquisition of Sprint, a deal recently shelved in the face of opposition by antitrust regulators.)</p>
        <p>By contrast, the Bell companies, because of their legacy as part of AT&amp;T, have always had a significant union presence. AT&amp;T itself, still has 36,000 union workers of a total of 145,000 employees. And the former Bell company Nynex, which covered New York and New England before merging with Bell Atlantic a few years ago, was always considered a union bastion with its New York-to-Maine territory.</p>
        <p>''The strength of organized labor is a nontrivial reason why Nynex had lower productivity than its peers,'' said Eric Strumingher, a communications analyst at PaineWebber.</p>
        <p>''Go back and look at the CLEC's,'' Mr. Strumingher added, using telecommunications jargon to refer to new local communications companies like MFS, which was acquired by Worldcom, and Teleport, which was acquired by AT&amp;T. ''They had nonunion labor, and they were competing against companies that were unionized, and that was a clear advantage.''</p>
        <p>In the end, of course, there is only so much money to go around, and everyone -- workers, management, investors -- wants as much as they can get. Labor negotiations may not quite be a zero-sum game, but they can appear quite close.</p>
        <p>''In the end, I think everything will be fine,'' said Adrian G. Davies, a communications analyst for Federated Investors, the mutual fund company based in Pittsburgh. ''But unionization means less money for shareholders, and of course we're not happy about that.''</p>
