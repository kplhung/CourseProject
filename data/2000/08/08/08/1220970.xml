        <p>Even as the public stock markets cooled, the level of venture capital investment nationwide was little changed in the second quarter, the National Venture Capital Association reported yesterday.</p>
        <p>In fact, more companies received investments in the April-June period than in either of the previous two quarters, though the amount invested declined slightly for the second consecutive quarter after growing at a blistering pace last year.</p>
        <p>And the survey found that electronic-commerce companies had fallen out of favor, with Internet-related investments focused increasingly on communications and infrastructure start-ups.</p>
        <p>The survey found the nation's 640 venture capital firms, and the venture investment arms of corporations, poured $24.5 billion into 1,695 companies, compared with investments of $24.8 billion in 1,627 companies in the first quarter.</p>
        <p>Still, the increase from a year earlier was striking. In the second quarter of 1999, $12.5 billion was invested in 1,168 start-ups.</p>
        <p>But since April, when technology stock prices dropped precipitously, some venture capitalists have said that they are investing in start-ups less aggressively than they did last year, wary that they will not be able to take the companies public so readily.</p>
        <p>Jeanne Metzger, director of marketing for the National Venture Capital Association, an industry trade group, said the present rate of investment showed that venture firms were still financing entrepreneurs at a healthy rate.</p>
        <p>''The V.C. industry continues to grow at a strong pace,'' she said, particularly ''when you take into account that this was a period of substantial market volatility.'' She added that the fact that the investment rate leveled off should not be cause for concern because the growth in investing last year -- an increase of 150 percent over the total in 1998 -- was unsustainable.</p>
        <p>The survey, conducted in conjunction with Venture Economics, a division of Thomson Financial Securities Data, found that Internet-related investments grew to $19.9 billion in the second quarter, from $19 billion in the previous period. Of such investments, communications and infrastructure companies -- like those focused on wireless technology, telephony, or voice and data transmission -- attracted 26.9 percent, compared with 20.1 percent in the first quarter.</p>
        <p>E-commerce companies, in contrast, attracted 14.5 percent of Internet-related investments, compared with 27.2 percent in the first quarter.</p>
