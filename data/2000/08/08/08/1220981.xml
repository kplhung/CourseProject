        <p>No shots have been fired yet, but there is a war going on under the leafy summer canopy that shades the streets in the Lefortovo district of the Russian capital. Here, on 20 acres of factory grounds, thousands of workers are daily engaged in the production of one of Russia's most essential commodities -- vodka.</p>
        <p>Precisely because vodka is such needed balm for the Russian soul, the country has been riveted -- in the political lull of August -- by the struggle for control of the Krystall factory. It is one of the country's oldest vodka-producing plants, and last year it rolled out 130 million bottles of famous brands like Stolichnaya and Krystall, sold in the West as Crystall.</p>
        <p>Given the factory's well-known trade marks and estimated value of $600 million, it was perhaps only a matter of time before this economic plum became one that rival forces sought to pluck. The only thing both sides agree on is that the federal government's attempt to reconsolidate control over the lucrative vodka industry -- an effort that has increased since President Vladimir V. Putin was sworn in in May -- set off the latest of Russia's business battles.</p>
        <p>On Friday, armed paramilitary policemen stormed the administration building of the factory, ordering everyone out, ostensibly so tax authorities could seize some documents. Once the building was secured, the troopers made way for Aleksandr I. Romanov to enter the building and occupy the general manager's suite, along with dozens of muscular private security guards who were hired for the occasion. Then the Swat team departed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Romanov, 37, has never worked at Krystall and knows little of the vodka business. For the last several years, he has served as a vice president in charge of public relations and other duties at Rosneft, Russia's state-owned oil company. He describes himself as a highly trained ''top manager'' and only grudgingly acknowledges that he went to school with the deputy minister in the state property administration, who happens to be leading one of the warring factions on Krystall's board of directors.</p>
        <p>About 100 feet away from Mr. Romanov's second-floor encampment, the chief accountant and acting general manager of the Krystall factory, Vladimir L. Svirsky, also 37, leads the other faction of board members who control 40 percent of the company's stock. They have set up defensive positions at the entrance to the factory's production lines where frightened workers tried to complete their shift on Friday hoping that violence would not erupt.</p>
        <p>''This shouldn't be happening in a factory as important as this,'' said Svetlana Soborova, who has worked at Krystall for 18 years and sells the product in the company's retail store.</p>
        <p>And yet, on a weekend when a state of emergency had been declared in Moscow to guard against possible terrorist acts by Chechnya rebels, neither the courts nor police nor federal government seemed willing to act. The neighborhood around the 100-year-old factory became a sea of muscle, with private security guards hired by each warring camp facing off in front of the huge enterprise, in which the state has a 51 percent controlling interest. Each side sent patrols out to roam the streets and alleys around the factory looking for ways to outmaneuver each other and get control of the premises.</p>
        <p>''In Russia unfortunately we have the phenomenon of a weak state, where the legal institutions, too, are very weak,'' said Grigory A. Koshkarov, a financial adviser to the factory.</p>
        <p>For the last two years, Russia's leaders have been rediscovering a truism of the Soviet era -- that vodka, and the tax revenues derived from its sale, can be the salvation of a beleaguered national budget.</p>
        <p>But that will hold true now only if the government can re-establish control over the wild vodka industry, where half or more of the market has been seized by an enormous shadow industry of illegal and counterfeit distillers.</p>
        <p>Last year, the government collected $470 million in taxes on alcohol production, and some estimates indicate that this number could double under tighter state control.</p>
        <p>Soon after being sworn in in May, Mr. Putin signed a decree creating a new state-owned conglomerate, Rosspiritprom, to consolidate state control over 50 distilleries in which the Russian government owns a majority stake and 20 others in which it is a minority shareholder.</p>
        <p>The physical showdown over Krystall follows months of maneuvering in the boardroom and the courts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Romanov went to court last spring seeking to enforce the board's decision to appoint him acting general manager of the plant, but the court ruled that the appointment was illegal because opposing directors did not receive 10 days notice.</p>
        <p>Mr. Romanov claimed that his rival Mr. Svirsky bribed the judge, but then acknowledged that he had no evidence. The board met again in June and reaffirmed Mr. Romanov's appointment, but Mr. Svirsky and his directors walked out.</p>
        <p>Mr. Svirsky asserts that one or another of Russia's business oligarchs close to the Kremlin is behind Mr. Romanov's appointment and is seeking to get control of the 40 percent stake in the company now controlled by employees, managers and their allies. But Mr. Svirsky too said he had no proof of this charge.</p>
        <p>Instead of waiting for the courts to act on its petitions, Mr. Romanov's faction orchestrated Friday's takeover.</p>
        <p>In an interview, Mr. Romanov presented himself as the vanguard of state power come to reclaim the alcohol industry from incompetents, thieves and ''swindlers.'' He accused Mr. Svirsky of disobeying board directives, and of trying to become a ''new oligarch'' by amassing 40 percent of the company shares and behaving like ''Napoleon.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Svirsky countered that his faction of board members is fighting to keep control of management, which he says is justified by record profits and tax payments posted in 1999. ''We are trying to prove our right to work at this enterprise by the results of our work,'' he said.</p>
        <p>By Sunday night, both Mr. Romanov and Mr. Svirsky were showing the strain of their standoff. Desktops were littered with the detritus of cold cuts and fast food. Mr. Svirsky needed a shave, and Mr. Romanov had been sleeping in his clothes and worrying about Mr. Svirsky's guard dogs, one of them known as a ''man-eater,'' that might be loosed on his men if they entered the plant.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Svirsky addressed employees returning to work, telling them to ignore any orders from Mr. Romanov's men. And the chairman of the board, Yevgeny A. Panteleev, reiterated his support for Mr. Romanov's insurgency.</p>
        <p>''This is the face of our Russian democracy,'' said a somewhat grizzled security guard, who wore blue sneakers and stood with his arms akimbo in front of the factory gate. Mr. Svirsky has effectively blocked any actions to turn over shares in the factory to his opponents by hiding the corporate seal.</p>
        <p>''I am like a kamikaze,'' Mr. Svirsky said, ''and I will fight for my rights to the death.''</p>
