        <p>Most of the sites where the federal government built nuclear bombs will never be cleaned up enough to allow public access to the land, and the plan for guarding sites that are permanently contaminated is inadequate, the National Academy of Sciences said today in a report.</p>
        <p>''At many sites, radiological and nonradiological hazardous wastes will remain, posing risks to humans and the environment for tens or even hundreds of thousands of years,'' the report said.

        <p>Most of the sites where the federal government built nuclear bombs will never be cleaned up enough to allow public access to the land, and the plan for guarding sites that are permanently contaminated is inadequate, the National Academy of Sciences said today in a report.</p>
        <p>''At many sites, radiological and nonradiological hazardous wastes will remain, posing risks to humans and the environment for tens or even hundreds of thousands of years,'' the report said. ''Complete elimination of unacceptable risks to humans and the environment will not be achieved, now or in the foreseeable future.''</p>
        <p>The idea that the production of nuclear weapons has produced ''national sacrifice zones,'' land that the public can never use again, is not new. The term became common in environmental circles in the late 1980's, when the United States began recognizing the environmental legacy of the Manhattan Project, the effort during World War II to develop atomic weapons, and the cold war.</p>
        <p>But the report, commissioned by the Department of Energy, goes a step further. It says that the government can try to declare certain areas permanently off-limits, but that it lacks the technology, money and management techniques to prevent the contamination from spreading.</p>
        <p>In addition, some of the contaminants have already ''migrated'' outside plant boundaries and others will follow, the report said.</p>
        <p>Thomas M. Leschine, the chairman of the committee that wrote the report, said managers could use barbed wire and guards at the sites.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Leschine, an associate professor in the School of Marine Affairs at the University of Washington, added: ''There's no assurance that we can maintain any of that control. It's one thing to put a fence up around something, but it's really something else to maintain it in perpetuity.''</p>
        <p>Controls on the use of some of the land are already breaking down, the report said. For example, in the early 1990's, the Department of Energy  sold land near its Oak Ridge Reservation in Tennessee for use as a golf course, stipulating that the groundwater was contaminated and was not to be used. ''Within a few years, however, D.O.E. discovered that a well was being drilled to irrigate the golf course,'' the report said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Leschine said the committee had found another case in which the  Department of Energy had posted ''no fishing'' signs at a creek near Oak Ridge because of radiation contamination in the water.</p>
        <p>''The signs all got stolen, because the local high school kids thought they were nice things to have,'' he said. ''Then there were months of protracted battles between the local authorities and the Department of Energy, over whose responsibility it was to replace the signs.''</p>
        <p>At the Department of Energy, Gerald G. Boyd, the deputy assistant secretary for science and technology, said his agency established a long-term stewardship office a year ago to cope with the problem, with about a dozen people working with engineers and planners at the various sites. The office was established soon after the department requested the study from the National Academy of Sciences, Mr. Boyd said.</p>
        <p>The department has accelerated its clean-up efforts, reduce the costs involved and minimize risks to surrounding communities, but a perfect cleanup is not possible, he said.</p>
        <p>As an example of the breakdown of control, Dr. Leschine cited the fire that endangered the Los Alamos National Laboratory, in New Mexico, in May. The fire set the stage for mud slides in the coming rainy season that could contaminate the Rio Grande with radioactive and chemical toxins from the laboratory.</p>
        <p>But the cause of the blaze was not  natural or malicious; the fire was set by another government agency as part of its land-management efforts.</p>
        <p>The report said that no plan written now to minimize the spread of uncontained wastes would suffice over the tens, hundreds or even thousands of years that some of the contaminants would remain dangerous.</p>
        <p>It urged the department to assume that engineered barriers like concrete and steel would eventually fail, and that most of what was known about the behavior of contaminants in air, soil or water might ''eventually be proven wrong.'' The department needs a long-term program that ''actively seeks out and applies new knowledge,'' the report said.</p>
        <p>The report identified 144 sites where the department and its predecessors, notably the Atomic Energy Commission, processed nuclear materials, and it said that 109 would not be cleaned up enough for unrestricted release, because of insufficient money, technical skill or political will to do the job.</p>
