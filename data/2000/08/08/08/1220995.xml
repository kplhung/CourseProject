        <p>THE PRIMARIES</p>
        <p>SETTLING ON CANDIDATES -- Democrats in Georgia's Seventh Congressional District will vote today to decide who will challenge Representative Bob Barr, a conservative Republican who was a House manager in the impeachment of President Clinton. The candidates in the runoff are Jim Williams, an insurance broker who ran against Mr. Barr two years ago, and Roger Kahn, a liquor distributor who has the support of Democratic officials in the district, which is northwest of Atlanta.</p>
        <p>In Colorado, four Republicans are seeking their party's nomination to challenge Representative Mark Udall, a first-term Democrat whose district includes Boulder, northwest of Denver.</p>

        <p>THE CONVENTIONS</p>
        <p>PROTEST IN LOS ANGELES -- Two women were arrested yesterday for scaling the 15-story Figueroa Hotel in Los Angeles, across the street from the site the Democratic National Convention, and trying to unfurl a giant banner denouncing corporate influence in politics. The banner, modeled after the United States flag with corporate logos in place of stars, became snagged and was never fully unfurled. The protest, organized by Action Resource Center, Adbusters, Amazon Watch, Rainforest Action Network and Ruckus Society was the first at the Staples Arena connected with the Democratic National Convention, which begins on Monday.</p>
