        <p>George Steinbrenner's Rotisserie baseball executives woke up last Thursday, found out that Jose Canseco was available on the waiver wire and inexplicably pounced on him. So the Yankees started the process that forced them to add the player that Steinbrenner has always adored, a player with bulging biceps, with Page Six possibilities and with a flickering marquee name.</p>
        <p>Why? Why did the Yankees need a 36-year-old player who does not own a glove, who lumbers around the bases as if he is playing slow-pitch softball and who is such a productive home run hitter this year that he has four more than Clay Bellinger? The Yankees should have given the dangerous choice deeper thought since Canseco fits them as comfortably as Madonna would fit in as a librarian.</p>
        <p>But General Manager Brian Cashman knows how Steinbrenner operates, and he knows that Steinbrenner would probably have shouted in his ear if another team claimed and got Canseco. Cashman claimed Canseco and 47 other players last Thursday to block opponents and, for worse, not better, the Yankees wound up stuck with Canseco when the Tampa Bay Devil Rays let him go yesterday to save slightly less than $1 million.</p>
        <p>A decision that is made to pacify Steinbrenner is not always logical, and this one was not. Cashman and the Yankees made their first error in two months, a blunder that will not help a team that has been carefully remodeled to ensure that a third straight World Series title remained possible.</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner spoke deliberately during a telephone interview yesterday and was reluctant to answer several questions about how Canseco became a Yankee. The owner sounded as exasperated as Cashman and Manager Joe Torre about the stunning and unnecessary addition of Canseco.</p>
        <p>''I think they got caught up in something they didn't think about,'' Steinbrenner said. ''But I'm behind my people. I'm totally supportive of what they did. I'm happy the man is coming here, and I hope he does the job for me.''</p>
        <p>These are not your 2000 Yankees from spring training. These are your 2000 Yankees from today, born of many changes that have given an aging team with flaws a better chance to survive through October. Until yesterday, Cashman and Mark Newman had made flawless decisions.</p>
        <p>They scooped up Denny Neagle and David Justice long before the nonwaiver trading deadline. They made a smart move to acquire Jose Vizcaino. They rescued and revived Dwight Gooden and they added some power in Glenallen Hill, who is better than Canseco. The Yankees also made a $66,000 investment in Luis Polonia last week. A few hours after the Canseco deal, they obtained the former Yankee Luis Sojo from Pittsburgh because Chuck Knoblauch was disabled, another shrewd trade. But the Canseco claim was terrible, reducing Torre to a succession of ''I don't knows'' about Canseco's role.</p>
        <p>''I'm a little stunned,'' said Torre, who made no attempt to disguise his disgust. ''I don't get surprised very often. I was a little surprised.'' Cashman added, ''We got him so now, hopefully, he can fit in.''</p>
        <p>When Polonia was signed, a nervous Ryan Thompson asked a reporter if he would be bounced off the 25-man roster. Thompson was not, but he will find out today that he has been sacrificed to make room for Canseco.</p>
        <p>This is senseless because Thompson is a stellar defensive outfielder who can play all three positions. Now Thompson will be jettisoned for a designated hitter who might be a designated pinch-hitter in the Bronx. Without Thompson, who plays center field if Bernie Williams is injured? Obviously, Canseco, who joked that he could play shortstop or third base, makes the Yankees much less flexible until the rosters expand on Sept. 1 and might give them as many D.H.'s as starting pitchers.</p>
        <p>''I really don't know how I'm going to fit in with the New York Yankees,'' admitted Canseco, a walking, talking distraction who longingly said he would like to be the full-time D.H. ''I just know that I'm a New York Yankee.''</p>
        <p>Cashman leaned back in his office chair last Thursday night, with the bags under his eyes drooping like hammocks, and talked about how stressful the waiver period can be. A general manager must gamble, not only trying to make his team better, but also trying to prevent other teams from improving. When Harold Baines went from Baltimore to Cleveland in the waiver period last year, a move Cashman could not block, Steinbrenner went ballistic.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes,'' Cashman said, ''I hate this.''</p>
        <p>Still, even if another team wanted Canseco, the Yankees should not have cared. This was Canseco, not John Wetteland or Pedro Astacio. Canseco has 440 career homers and was a potent slugger as recently as 1998 with 46 homers, but he has a fatigued body and has struck out once every 3.4 at-bats this year. Too bad Steinbrenner's passion kept the Yankees from ignoring Canseco.</p>
        <p>Canseco will show up at Yankee Stadium today, 12 years after he hit 42 homers and was the American League's most valuable player. He becomes a more muscular Wilson Delgado on a team that did not need him, a team whose owner has long been intrigued by Canseco and is now stuck with an albatross. Why, George, why?</p>
        <p>''I've always liked Canseco,'' admitted Steinbrenner, an admiration that made Cashman react and brought the Yankees a 240-pound nuisance.</p>
