        <p>Moving to gain a foothold in India's potentially vast market, Singapore Telecommunications Ltd. will pay $400 million for a minority stake in the largest privately owned telecommunications company in India, Bharti Group. The deal is part of a strategy by Singapore Telecom, the country's former monopoly telecommunications provider, to remain competitive as deregulation and new rivals eat into its profits at home. Singapore Telecom's efforts earlier this year to buy stakes in Cable and Wireless HKT Bhd. of Hong Kong and Time Engineering Bhd. of Malaysia were thwarted by political reservations about its largest shareholder, Singapore's government.</p>
