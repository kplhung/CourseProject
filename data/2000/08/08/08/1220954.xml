        <p>BEN, IN THE WORLD  By Doris Lessing  178 pages. HarperCollins. $23.</p>
        <p>Twelve years ago Doris Lessing wrote a grisly little horror tale called ''The Fifth Child,'' a sort of highbrow ''Rosemary's Baby,'' which recounted the story of a monstrous child born into a middle-class London family. The child, Ben, looks like a grotesque gnome or troll and displays an equally ugly personality: he kills the family's dog and cat, tortures his brothers and sisters and thoroughly disrupts the family's heretofore idyllic life.</p>
        <p>When the sequel to that book, ''Ben, in the World,'' opens, Ben is 18 and on his own, roaming the streets of London. He now looks like a yeti or caveman and still has fits of brutal anger. He feasts on birds he catches with his bare hands, and when he sees one of his brothers in a park he can barely suppress his murderous rage.</p>
        <p>Still, this Ben is more sinned against than sinning. Whereas the Ben in ''The Fifth Child'' was often an active agent of disruption, the Ben in this volume is usually a victim, mocked and abused by others who cannot accept his otherness.</p>
        <p>The bigger difference between the two books, however, lies in the author's handling of Ben's story. In ''The Fifth Child'' Ms. Lessing created a perfect balance between naturalistic detail and fablelike allegory. In fact the sense of terror that the book generated in the reader stemmed in large measure from the insinuation of a frightening, inexplicable creature into a thoroughly ordinary, recognizable world; it was as if Frankenstein's monster had been plunked down in a London -- or New York -- suburb and sent to school with our children.</p>
        <p>''Ben, in the World,'' in contrast, reads entirely like a fairy tale, and a not very compelling one at that. All of the subsidiary characters -- including a whore with a heart of gold and an evil Dr. Mengele-type scientist who wants to perform strange experiments on Ben -- are either kindly good Samaritans trying to help Ben or evil villains out to exploit him. All of Ben's encounters with these people have the contrived feel of incidents meant to illustrate society's reaction to people who don't fit in.</p>
        <p>Because nothing feels very real in this novella, because Ben and everyone else seem like cardboard cutouts, the reader feels neither pity nor fear for the characters, only a vague sense of irritation. Indeed ''Ben, in the World,'' like the author's last novel, ''Mara and Dann,'' points up a curious development in Ms. Lessing's recent fiction: a seemingly arbitrary decision to jettison both the visionary grandeur of the ''Canopus in Argos'' series and the psychological nuance and social detail of her early ''Martha Quest'' stories in favor of a more primitive, knee-jerk brand of storytelling.</p>
        <p>In the case of ''Ben, in the World,'' the story Ms. Lessing tells consists of little more than a series of picaresque adventures that take Ben from England to France to Brazil. In London Ben meets a kindly old woman who takes him in off the streets and tries to care for him. He next meets a prostitute and her pimp, who decide to use him as an unwitting accomplice in a drug deal: they load him up with suitcases stuffed with cocaine, put him on a plane to Nice and arrange for him to be met by a colleague.</p>
        <p>In Nice Ben is taken up by a would-be film director who wants to make a movie starring him as a kind of Neanderthal alien. The director takes Ben to Rio, where another former hooker befriends him. She and her friends must later try to rescue Ben from a villainous scientist who has kidnapped him and taken him to a remote laboratory referred to as ''the bad place.'' The scientist, not Ben, we're reminded, is the real monster -- ''a monster of cruelty.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Lessing spends a great deal of space describing how this scientist demeans Ben by locking him in a cage like an animal, but she dwells at obnoxious length on Ben's animal-like appearance and behavior. She describes him barking during sex and whimpering in his sleep. She repeatedly discusses his hairy body, his heightened sense of smell, his voracious appetite for raw meat.</p>
        <p>''His hunger hurt and threatened him,'' she writes, ''It was not an easy hunger: the thin taste of bread or a bun could not satisfy it. It was a need for meat, and he smelled the rawness of blood, the reek of it: yet this hunger was dangerous to him. Sometimes, when he had gone into a butcher's shop, pulled there by the smell, his body had seemed to engorge with wanting, and his arms stretched out of their own accord towards the meat.''</p>
        <p>Such descriptions make Ben out to be some sort of generic creature, endowed with only the most instinctual reactions and responses, and Ms. Lessing does nothing to give him a discernible personality. Her other characters are described in an even more cursory manner, their fates dismissively summed up in a careless sentence or two. We learn that the London hooker and pimp use their cocaine profits to become part of the landed gentry: ''So you could say that this part of our tale had a happy ending.'' And we learn that the Brazilian ex-hooker and her boyfriend marry and start a new life: ''So their story at least has a happy ending: things turned out well for them.''</p>
        <p>As for Ben, Ms. Lessing concocts a fate for him that's as preposterous as it's predictable. A fitting end, in a way, for such a flimsy, crudely written story.</p>
