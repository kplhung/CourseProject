        <p>Fund-Raiser At a Noisy Rental</p>
        <p>When JAN WITOLD BARAN, the former general counsel to the Republican National Committee, rented a $1,000-a-day house in West Chop on Martha's Vineyard, Mass., he was unaware that the house next door belonged to HARVEY WEINSTEIN, the co-chairman of Miramax and host of a fund-raising event for HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON on Sunday evening.</p>

        <p>Fund-Raiser At a Noisy Rental</p>
        <p>When JAN WITOLD BARAN, the former general counsel to the Republican National Committee, rented a $1,000-a-day house in West Chop on Martha's Vineyard, Mass., he was unaware that the house next door belonged to HARVEY WEINSTEIN, the co-chairman of Miramax and host of a fund-raising event for HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON on Sunday evening.</p>
        <p>''There was nothing but noise and preparation for two days,'' said Mr. Baran, who had arrived last week hoping for peace and quiet. ''Tents and wooden stages on Saturday, and on Sunday, the practicing of Jimmy Buffett and Carly Simon and finally the party.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Baran gave a moment-by-moment description yesterday. The president, he said, ''seemed to be having a great time.'' How did Mr. Baran know that? ''All the amplifiers and the stage were about 25 feet from us. He spoke, she spoke, Carly spoke and sang and then introduced a new song called 'Hillary,' which seemed to have only one word in it.''</p>
        <p>Things were quiet after the Clintons left. But at 2 a.m., he said, a band started playing. His wife, KATHRYN KAVANAGH BARAN, ''who is a Democrat,'' Mr. Baran noted, called the Weinsteins' house. ''She said: 'Could you please stop the music? It's 2 in the morning.' And they did.''</p>
        <p>Gore Gridlock In the Hamptons</p>
        <p>''Did you have trouble getting here?'' ASHLEY SCHIFF asked. ''I heard they closed the highway.'' And for a moment it seemed as if too many of the traffic headaches in the Hamptons on Saturday had had to do with VICE PRESIDENT AL GORE or his relatives. He was at a fund-raiser in East Hampton, and Ms. Schiff, whose brother is married to Mr. Gore's daughter Karenna, was presiding over a dinner party in Southampton.</p>
        <p>Ms. Schiff's gathering was a birthday party for ALFONSE M. D'AMATO, the former senator, and MARK SLESHER. ''Julia Koch's brother,'' Ms. Schiff explained. ''Julia is one of my best friends.'' Mrs. Koch was there, with her husband, DAVID (''they were the co-hosts with me,'' Ms. Schiff said). So were LEONARD STERN, the chairman of Hartz Industries, and his wife, ALLISON; CHARLES A. GARGANO, the chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation; ZENIA MUCHA, a former spokeswoman for Mr. D'Amato who is a senior adviser to Gov. George E. Pataki; PERRI PELTZ, a correspondent for CNN, and her husband, ERIC RUTTENBERG.</p>
        <p>Mr. Koch's cake was a big 3 and a big 5 -- he is between 30 and 40. The cake for Mr. D'Amato, who is 63, looked like a Monopoly board.</p>
        <p>''My parents have known Alfonse for 20 years, and he's a completely loyal friend,'' Ms. Schiff said. ''Plus, he threw my birthday dinner, so I thought I should throw his. And he sponsored my polo team.'' A frown. The team -- officially, the Park Strategies team, named for the investment company in which Mr. D'Amato is a partner -- had lost earlier in the day, at the Bridgehampton Polo Club.</p>
        <p>Some people left early and missed seeing Mr. D'Amato, but he was on hand. The security men in Ms. Schiff's driveway said that his was the big black Lincoln.</p>
        <p>Book Party At a Special Pond</p>
        <p>The way PRISCILLA RATTAZZI explains the evolution of her book -- ''Georgica Pond,'' about the ultra-exclusive body of water in East Hampton, N.Y., where STEVEN SPIELBERG, MARTHA STEWART and Ms. Rattazzi and her husband, CHRISTOPHER WHITTLE, have houses -- sounds like a countdown: Twelve years ago, bought house. Ten years ago, moved in. Nine years ago, started taking pictures. Three years ago, decided to do book. Four days ago, had book party on lawn.</p>
        <p>What's so special about Georgica Pond? ''Everything,'' Ms. Rattazzi said. ''The most important thing, it's right on the ocean. Only a spit of sand separates it from the Atlantic Ocean. And it's a tremendous feeding ground for birds, crabs and fish.'' She is donating her proceeds to the Nature Conservancy.</p>
        <p>So there were guests who were talking about piping plovers and guests who were talking about misadventures on the way to the Republican National Convention.</p>
        <p>JENNIFER MAGUIRE, a vice president for news programming at CNN, said that she went by train. ''I fell asleep as soon as I got on,'' she said, and slept through Philadelphia. ''I woke up in Washington,'' she said. ''I was like, where is everybody?''</p>
