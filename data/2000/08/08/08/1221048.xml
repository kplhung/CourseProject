        <p>The departure of Police Commissioner Howard Safir, one of the most loyal and prominent members of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's inner circle, would leave vacant a city post that is coveted in law enforcement circles but available under imperfect circumstances.</p>
        <p>On one hand, the commissioner's post is one of the ultimate jobs in American policing, a position of national prominence that was once held by Theodore Roosevelt, whose gold shield hangs on the wall of the commissioner's spacious 14th-floor suite at 1 Police Plaza. On the other, the job would be stand-in work under a lame-duck mayor. And the department is threatened with federal oversight because of a finding that it does not adequately discipline officers who use excessive force.</p>
        <p>City officials said yesterday that Mr. Safir's successor must be able to balance the demands of supervising 40,000 officers and navigating the department's relentless internal politics, all the while catering to the wishes of Mr. Giuliani, who has been an active manager of the police.</p>
        <p>And so, the officials said, the short list of probable candidates held no surprises. It includes three well-established members of the administration: Joseph P. Dunne, the current chief of department; Bernard B. Kerik, the commissioner of the city's Department of Correction; and Nicholas Scoppetta, the commissioner of the city's Administration for Children's Services.</p>
        <p>The candidates offer decades of law enforcement and management experience, as well as years of working closely with Mr. Giuliani.</p>
        <p>As chief of department, Chief Dunne, 52, is the highest-ranking uniformed member of the force, a position he achieved after a 31-year career that began as a beat officer in Brooklyn. As the coordinator of the department's crime-fighting strategy known as Compstat -- a series of regular meetings in which precinct commanders are held accountable for all of the crimes reported in their neighborhoods and documented in a central database -- he is the only candidate with a senior perspective on the city's idiosyncratic brand of police operations.</p>
        <p>Chief Dunne is respected, even liked, by the department's rank and file, and is seen as a police official with especially strong links to the city's minority neighborhoods. He was out of the city yesterday and could not be reached for comment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerik, 44, a former city police officer, offers a blend of law enforcement and management experience, and a proven record at the Department of Correction. He left the police force in 1994 after eight years as a narcotics detective, during which he received 30 police citations, including the department's Medal of Valor for a close-quarters shootout with a drug dealer.</p>
        <p>After becoming the Department of Correction's director of investigations in 1994, he was promptly promoted to first deputy commissioner, and in 1998 became commissioner.</p>
        <p>While he has little experience supervising police operations, his tenure overseeing 16 city jails -- including 13,000 employees -- that handle 125,000 inmates each year has been marked by a sharp decrease in violence, and he enjoys a reputation as an accomplished manager.</p>
        <p>City officials said there was one weakness in Mr. Kerik's record: he does not have a college degree. A high school dropout with an equivalency diploma, he has been taking courses through Empire State College, and needs 24 more credits to complete a bachelor's degree, a city official said yesterday. Mr. Kerik could not be reached for comment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Scoppetta, 67, a senior partner of sorts in city government circles, is the candidate with the broadest experience. He has served in the Army, been both a state and federal prosecutor, investigated police corruption in the 1970's for the Knapp Commission, was the city's commissioner of investigations under Mayors John V. Lindsay and Abraham D. Beame, and was a deputy mayor for criminal justice in the Beame administration.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani appointed him to his current job in 1996 to manage an overhaul of the city's child welfare agency. Because of his experience and standing, he would be a noncontroversial appointment for a department under intense scrutiny, but some city officials said yesterday that he was thought to be satisfied with his current post. He could not be reached yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's spokeswoman did not return a call seeking comment.</p>
        <p>As speculation intensified yesterday, city officials said it was difficult to divine the mayor's intentions.  ''Sometimes these processes work in strange ways,'' one official said.</p>
