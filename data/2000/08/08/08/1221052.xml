        <p>Ending one of corporate America's most bitter family feuds, an international arbitrator cleaved the world's largest consulting firm from the world's largest accounting firm yesterday.</p>
        <p>The ruling frees Andersen Consulting, with 65,000 employees, from its parent company, which now consists entirely of Arthur Andersen, a tax and auditing firm with 77,000 employees. In exchange, Andersen Consulting will have to give up its name and pay Arthur Andersen $1 billion.</p>
        <p>Analysts said the decision, which ended a three-year battle that had distracted the sprawling company, was a major victory for the consultants. Hours after it was announced, the chief executive of Arthur Andersen resigned.</p>
        <p>At the heart of dispute was the same thing that has ended hundreds of other partnerships: money. The last decade, as Andersen Consulting became more profitable than the firm that had founded it, the consultants began to chafe over sharing their profits with the accountants. The frustration exploded into an arbitration filing in 1997, with the consultants accusing the accountants of violating an internal agreement by creating their own consulting unit and competing for the same clients.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's announcement -- made in Paris by the International Court of Arbitration, which appointed a Colombian lawyer to oversee the case -- immediately separated the businesses. Since 1989, the partnerships had operated under one umbrella company called Andersen Worldwide but in recent years had as little to do with each other as possible.</p>
        <p>As traumatic as the rift has been for the partners, clients of both firms have remained largely shielded from it and are unlikely to be affected by the split, analysts said.</p>
        <p>After the ruling, Andersen Consulting partners said they were elated, largely because they have split off their unit without having to pay any of the $14.6 billion in damages that Arthur Andersen had sought. The payment of $1 billion, most of which was in an escrow account, covers past profit-sharing fees that Andersen Consulting refused to pay while the arbitration was continuing.</p>
        <p>''There's been a morning of celebration and euphoria here,'' Joe W. Forehand, Andersen Consulting's chief executive, said in a conference call with analysts and reporters yesterday. The ruling could add about $200,000 to the annual pay of each of Andersen's 1,200 partners.</p>
        <p>Arthur Andersen's chief executive, Jim Wadia, said that his fellow partners were happy with the ruling and that he would resign because, having been appointed three years ago largely to oversee the dispute, his work was done. In an interview, he called the decision a ''7 to 7.5'' on a scale of one to 10.</p>
        <p>The arbitrator, Guillermo Gamba, ruled that Arthur Andersen had not breached the 1989 agreement by setting up its own consulting unit and that Andersen Consulting could not use a computer system designed by Arthur Andersen in the 1970's and 1980's. Dr. Gamba instead blamed Andersen Worldwide, a bare-bones bureaucracy in Geneva, for not assuring cooperation between the two units, as the pact said it would.</p>
        <p>But analysts still called the decision surprisingly favorable for the consulting unit. They said that Mr. Wadia had turned down a settlement offer a few years ago that would have given the firm more money than did the ruling -- while sparing it years of acrimony. Mr. Wadia ''is not going to be very popular with the Arthur Andersen partners,'' said Wayne Cooper, the president of Kennedy Information, which follows the consulting business.</p>
        <p>''This is a huge win for Andersen Consulting,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Even as the decision formally separated the businesses, nastiness continued between partners who had built a business together and still ride the same elevators in a Midtown Manhattan building where employees of both firms work. Executives of the two firms spent hours yesterday dismissing -- sometimes vulgarly -- the other side's analysis as misleading or simply false.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wadia, a British citizen, said he would take particular pleasure in Andersen Consulting's having to remove a large sign displaying its logo in the British Airways terminal at Kennedy Airport. ''The way I look at it, that's mine,'' he said, referring to the Andersen name.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Andersen Consulting's lead lawyer scoffed at the rival firm's opinion that the ruling was essentially a split decision. ''These guys just spin endlessly,'' said Barry R. Ostrager, a partner at Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett.</p>
        <p>Though the roots of the case are internal, the ruling is the latest example of the separation of consulting units from accounting firms. Such splits have come as the Securities and Exchange Commission has proposed restricting firms from selling advice to companies they also audit. In February, Ernst &amp; Young sold its consulting business to Cap Gemini, and PricewaterhouseCoopers and KPMG are also moving to shed their consulting units.</p>
        <p>The splits, however, leave accounting firms with the challenge of thriving without their fastest-growing units. The consolidation of companies from the automobile to the packaged-food industry has left accountants with fewer potential clients. At the same time, accountants have found themselves the subject of an increasing amount of litigation over aggressive bookkeeping used by companies desperate to meet their profit targets in a volatile stock market, said David F. Larcker, an accounting professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p>Unlike its rivals, Arthur Andersen will get virtually nothing for its consulting unit. ''That practice could easily be worth more than $10 billion,'' Professor Larcker said. Ernst &amp; Young, with a consulting business about half the size of Andersen Consulting's, received the equivalent of $11.1 billion from Cap Gemini.</p>
        <p>Arthur Andersen also risks losing some of its 1,700 partners, Mr. Cooper said, because they face a pay cut. Under the 1989 pact setting up the semiautonomous consulting unit, the more profitable of the two divisions had to pay as much as 15 percent of profits to the other. In recent years, the figure was more than $200 million, and Arthur Andersen was on the receiving end.</p>
        <p>Andersen Consulting will face its own set of difficulties, even if analysts said they were less intimidating. Last year, the firm's revenue grew 8 percent, far below its typical rate in recent years and half of the industry average in 1999, according to Kennedy Information. In response, Andersen Consulting is trying to shift its focus from installing computer systems to designing Internet strategies for both its traditional large clients and small start-ups. It has also created a venture capital division and begun to take equity stakes in clients in exchange for lower fees.</p>
        <p>Now, just two years after starting a $100 million marketing campaign to promote a new logo, the firm must spend another $100 million, by its own estimate, to make its new name well known. The task is made easier, however, because the firm's customers are a relatively small cadre of business executives rather than millions of consumers, said Clive Chajet, chairman of Chajet Consulting, a brand-identity concern in New York.</p>
        <p>Mr. Forehand said he and his partners had not yet decided on a new name and would hire their regular advertising firm, Young &amp; Rubicam, for the project. Analysts said they expected the firm to pick a name that evoked technology and might even drop the word ''consulting.'' Mr. Forehand said he did not expect the firm to use the dot-com suffix.</p>
        <p>Dr. Gamba, the arbitrator, barred the firm from ''using the 'Andersen' name or any derivative thereof,'' presumably preventing it from adopting ''AC,'' which forms the crux of the logo designed in 1998.</p>
        <p>Andersen Consulting's partners voted unanimously in December 1997 to sever ties with Arthur Andersen. The 1989 agreement, known as the Florida accord, called for any party leaving the partnership to pay a breakup fee equal to 150 percent of its annual revenue.</p>
        <p>Last year, Andersen Consulting had sales of $8.9 billion, and Arthur Andersen brought in $7.3 billion.</p>
        <p>The consultants contended in the arbitration case that the contract was void because Arthur Andersen's consulting unit had begun to pitch its services to all types of companies, rather than just the small and midsize ones that the pact said it could pursue. At the arbitration hearing in New York, the consultants introduced as evidence a video in which Arthur Andersen's top consultant praised his colleagues in 1995 for having ''winked and nodded'' at the ''arbitrary restriction.''</p>
        <p>The 1989 agreement called for the arbitration court, a part of the International Chamber of Commerce, to settle disputes. It then had to choose an arbitrator from a country in which neither the consulting nor accounting firm did business, leaving it a list of eight nations that included Iraq, Somalia, Sudan and Colombia.</p>
