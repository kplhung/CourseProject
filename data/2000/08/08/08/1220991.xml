        <p>A man accused of being the ringleader of the illegal street protests during the Republican National Convention had his bail reduced from $1 million to $100,000 yesterday, as defendants contended that the Philadelphia police were guilty of jailhouse brutality and city officials maintained there was a criminal conspiracy to shut down the city.</p>
        <p>During an appeal hearing, the million-dollar bail on misdemeanor charges was ruled excessive for John Sellers, the 33-year-old leader of the Ruckus Society of Berkeley, Calif. He denies leading a conspiracy and insists that he only trained demonstrators in the techniques of nonviolent civil disobedience.</p>
        <p>At the same hearing, Common Pleas Judge Lisa A. Richette rejected a request for bail reduction for about 150 defendants still in jail who are protesting their arrests by refusing to give their identities to city authorities. Most of the defendants are charged with misdemeanors, with bail of $20,000 or less. They would probably be released with no bail once they properly identified themselves, said the district attorney, Lynne M. Abraham.</p>
        <p>As more defendants from a total of 391 arrested returned to freedom with complaints about their detention conditions, the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania cited ''credible stories concerning serious injuries inflicted'' in jail, and urged anyone who was injured to file complaints with the city Police Advisory Commission.</p>
        <p>Larry Frankel, executive director of the A.C.L.U., accused city authorities of overreacting to the provocations and relatively petty crimes of some demonstrators.</p>
        <p>''We believe that vandalizing property, turning over trash cans, assaulting persons and shutting down the city by blocking traffic are not activities protected by the First Amendment,'' Mr. Frankel said, summarizing the main street incidents that occurred last Tuesday. ''However, they are not the kind of crimes that justify treating the defendants as if they were dangerous urban terrorists.''</p>
        <p>The main demonstration group, R2K Network, protests the ''corruption of democracy'' through the power of Wall Street and the globalized economy. Network leaders accuse the city of ''criminalizing dissent'' by pre-emptively arresting some protesters and seeking high bail, amounting to preventive detention. Network members noted that some of the same demonstrators arrested in April in Washington during a similar protest were eventually fined $5 for jaywalking.</p>
        <p>A network organizer, Beka Economopoulos, said some defendants had been brutalized, denied medication and ''hog tied'' ankle-to-wrist in jail.</p>
        <p>The police denied the accusations and said defendants were creating their own problems by offering fanciful identities, staging hunger strikes and, in some cases, stripping off their clothes to hinder identification from videotaped street protests.</p>
        <p>Mayor John F. Street has accused the protesters of ''a very well-thought-out, well-planned conspiracy to shut down the city.'' And the police commissioner, John P. Timoney, maintained that protest leaders had far more than nonviolent dissent in mind.</p>
        <p>''I call them conspirators and criminals and cowards,'' he said on Friday in detailing some charges, including what he said was the stringing of piano wire across Market Street in an attempt to injure police officers on horseback and bicycles.</p>
        <p>The gravity of that charge was conceded in an interview by Bradley Bridge, an assistant legal aid lawyer with the city's Defender Association. But Mr. Bridge complained that 70 defendants were being held for a far less suspicious incident -- being present in a factory raided by the police where street puppets and other protest materials were made.</p>
        <p>''I was there negotiating and saw the puppets,'' Mr. Bridge said. ''It's appalling those guys are still in jail.''</p>
        <p>City officials contended that, with the police widely praised for exercising restraint during the protests, the demonstrators were deprived of bloody encounters and now sought to create an issue with allegations of jailhouse brutality.</p>
        <p>Protest leaders argued that the city was bent on detaining defendants beyond the Democratic National Convention next week in Los Angeles. But they vowed that demonstrations planned for that convention would be stronger because of the arrests in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>With bail appeals continuing, the court did not reduce the $500,000 bail set for Darby Landy, 20, who is accused of a felony assault on the police in a street fracas with bicycling officers led by Commissioner Timoney.</p>
