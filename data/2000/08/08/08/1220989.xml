        <p>British Airways reported a 65 percent decline in quarterly earnings today, attributing the poor performance to the effects of the strong British pound and the rising price of jet fuel.</p>
        <p>The results for the March-June quarter were reported as the airline is trying to break out of a prolonged slump, partly through a proposed deal to acquire KLM Royal Dutch Airlines N.V. But there were increased signs today that those negotiations, which began in early June, had not advanced very far.</p>
        <p>While both airlines are still in exclusive talks, concerns over regulatory approval from both the European Union and the United States have cast doubt over the deal. Executives close to the talks have said that the two sides are not yet close to an agreement on a price for KLM. The chief executive of British Airways, Rod Eddington, said today that it remained unclear whether the talks would result in an agreement.</p>
        <p>The regulatory obstacles are high for a deal with KLM to receive approval. British Airways encountered regulatory problems when it tried to form an alliance with American Airlines. A deal with KLM was expected to face tougher antitrust scrutiny in Europe because the combined routes of both airlines would cover a large share of the market.</p>
        <p>For British Airways, which last year reported its first full-year loss in its history, the pressure to complete the deal and to push profit higher is enormous. The airline dismissed its previous chief executive, Robert Ayling, because of the company's continued downward spiral and hired Mr. Eddington away from Ansett Holdings, the Australian airline company, to strengthen management and help British Airways return to profit.</p>
        <p>The airline said pretax profit before one-time items dropped to $:8 million, or $12 million, from $:23 million a year earlier. Sales rose 4 percent, to $:2.3 billion.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, British Airways posted a loss of $:50 million after the charges were accounted for, compared with a profit of $:200 million a year earlier. Mr. Eddington acknowledged the problems. ''These results reflect the scale of the challenge we face in a highly competitive and price-sensitive market,'' he said. ''However, we are also beginning to see the benefits of the investment we have made in every section of the aircraft. The growth in premium traffic has been strong and yields throughout the airline are up.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, British Airways said business-class traffic during the first quarter rose 8.2 percent, which the airline said equates to a 2.9 percent rise in revenue per passenger.</p>
        <p>The airline said the rising price of jet fuel and the strong pound were largely responsible for the financial results. Fuel is one of the largest expenses for airlines, and a strong currency translates into fewer profits when overseas earnings are repatriated. ''The effect of a persistently strong pound on British manufacturers and the high cost of fuel give cause for concern,'' said Lord Marshall, chairman of British Airways. However, he said, ''We remain encouraged by the generally favorable economic climate which prevails in most of our key markets around the world.''</p>
        <p>Analysts said today that there was nothing surprising in the earnings results.</p>
        <p>''We remain cautiously optimistic,'' Andrew Light, an analyst at Solomon Smith Barney, wrote in a note to investors. But, he said, the uncertainty of the KLM deal remains a big risk for the stock.</p>
        <p>Shares of British Airways dropped 3 pence, to 388 pence, or about $5.82. KLM stock rose 5.9 percent, to 30.39 euros, or $27.50.</p>
