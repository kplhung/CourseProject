        <p>Palm Inc., the 3Com spin-off whose hand-held computers have struck a chord with mobile executives and students alike, released its fall lineup of new models, including the lowest-priced version the company has produced to date. The model, the m100, sells for $149 and includes an updated software program that lets users store handwritten notes. They come in basic black, but can be modified with $20 faceplates in five colors. Another new model, the wireless Palm VIIx, offers four times the memory of the popular Palm VII and costs about $450. Palm hopes the new models will help it retain its lead over Handspring and other competitors.</p>
