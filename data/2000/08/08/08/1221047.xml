        <p>Vice President Al Gore's decision to choose Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut as his running mate is certainly the most dramatic move he has made in his presidential campaign, and may turn out to be one of the smartest. It is not just that Mr. Lieberman has been an effective senator. Of far greater significance is that he was the first Democratic senator to denounce President Clinton for ''disgraceful'' and ''immoral'' conduct in the Lewinsky scandal and for his failure to speak truthfully to the American people about his behavior. In a very real sense, therefore, Mr. Lieberman's selection announces a redoubled effort on Mr. Gore's part to separate himself from Mr. Clinton's personal shortcomings. It also provides him with insulation on the character issue at a time when the Republicans, as Richard Cheney made clear in his speech at the Philadelphia convention, plan to make an issue of the erosion of presidential dignity during Bill Clinton's eight years in office.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's decision was bold in one other respect. Mr. Lieberman will be the first Jew to run on the national ticket of a major party. Recent polls have suggested that religion will not be an important factor when Americans make up their minds in this election. Nevertheless, Mr. Gore is in effect inviting the voters to tear down any remaining barriers against Jewish candidates, much as they did for John F. Kennedy's Catholicism a generation ago.</p>

        <p>Vice President Al Gore's decision to choose Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut as his running mate is certainly the most dramatic move he has made in his presidential campaign, and may turn out to be one of the smartest. It is not just that Mr. Lieberman has been an effective senator. Of far greater significance is that he was the first Democratic senator to denounce President Clinton for ''disgraceful'' and ''immoral'' conduct in the Lewinsky scandal and for his failure to speak truthfully to the American people about his behavior. In a very real sense, therefore, Mr. Lieberman's selection announces a redoubled effort on Mr. Gore's part to separate himself from Mr. Clinton's personal shortcomings. It also provides him with insulation on the character issue at a time when the Republicans, as Richard Cheney made clear in his speech at the Philadelphia convention, plan to make an issue of the erosion of presidential dignity during Bill Clinton's eight years in office.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's decision was bold in one other respect. Mr. Lieberman will be the first Jew to run on the national ticket of a major party. Recent polls have suggested that religion will not be an important factor when Americans make up their minds in this election. Nevertheless, Mr. Gore is in effect inviting the voters to tear down any remaining barriers against Jewish candidates, much as they did for John F. Kennedy's Catholicism a generation ago.</p>
        <p>As an Orthodox Jew who does not customarily work on the Jewish Sabbath, Mr. Lieberman may be called upon to explain how he will handle a job that demands full attention 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Mr. Lieberman has already provided an answer. He states that, while he does not carry out political or campaign activities on the sabbath, Jewish law obligates him to perform official government duties demanded of his job. He makes the analogy that Jewish law also obligates a doctor to help a sick patient in such circumstances.</p>
        <p>Other aspects of the choice were less surprising. Eight years ago, when Bill Clinton picked Mr. Gore, a middle-of-the-road Southerner, he broke from the traditional practice of selecting running mates from another part of the country to provide a geographical and in some cases ideological balance. Now Mr. Gore has reached out to a fellow centrist with a comparable record of breaking ranks with many of their fellow Democrats on important issues like defense and free trade. Mr. Lieberman was also one of only 10 Democratic senators who supported President Bush on the gulf war.</p>
        <p>On this issue, too, Mr. Lieberman seems a shrewd political choice, in that he will help inoculate Mr. Gore against charges that the Democrats have been soft on matters of national security. Similarly, Mr. Lieberman was and is a major advocate of campaign finance reform who was forthright in criticizing Democratic fund-raising abuses in 1996. This is also an issue where Mr. Gore, who has promised reforms, needs to bolster his credibility.</p>
        <p>Some Democratic liberals may be uneasy over Mr. Lieberman's readiness to ally himself with conservatives on social issues. He has criticized the television and music industries for too much violence and sex, and he has also been more willing than party orthodoxy to embrace school vouchers. But he has a solid record on gay rights, gun control and the environment, and he is pro-choice on the abortion issue. The Republicans may be tempted to replay the senator's biting attack on how the president degraded the White House. But if they go that route, they may find themselves reinforcing the virtue of his selection, and perhaps be seen as re-fighting the very battles in Washington that Governor Bush declared in his acceptance speech that he wants to move beyond.</p>
