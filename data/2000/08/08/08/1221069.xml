        <p>Vice President Al Gore picked Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut to be his running mate today, putting a Jew on a national ticket of a major party for the first time and choosing the first prominent Democrat to chastise President Clinton openly for his affair with Monica S. Lewinsky.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore is to announce his decision formally at a rally here at noon on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman was one of five candidates to be vetted by a corps of lawyers over the last two months and emerged as Mr. Gore's choice early this morning, after the vice president huddled for hours with top aides and family members at a hotel suite here.</p>
        <p>Gore aides said Mr. Lieberman brought a sense of moral rectitude to the ticket as well as a seriousness of purpose, qualities that Mr. Gore was intent on seeking after Gov. George W. Bush, his Republican rival, chose Dick Cheney, the former secretary of defense, as his running mate.</p>
        <p>Warren Christopher, the former secretary of state, who led Mr. Gore's selection process, said in an interview today that Mr. Bush's choice had influenced Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>''Cheney meant that the vice president's choice would be measured by a standard of seriousness reflected by his record,'' Mr. Christopher said.</p>
        <p>But the comments of the Gore camp, laced with words like ''integrity'' and ''rectitude,'' also seemed to reflect their desire to use Mr. Lieberman to move their candidate away from the scandals of the Clinton administration, which provided a theme of the recent Republican National Convention.</p>
        <p>''If you look at both men, Al Gore and Joe Lieberman, they're both people who throughout their lives made the right choices,'' said Chris Lehane, Mr. Gore's spokesman. ''Both led very responsible lives and are people who, when faced with tough choices, have time and time again made the right choice.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman has also been a vigorous advocate of campaign finance reform, and he recently supported legislation that would ban unregulated donations to political parties. His record on the issue could clearly benefit Mr. Gore, whose aggressive fund-raising efforts in 1996 are expected to be the subject of Republican attacks in the fall.</p>
        <p>But in choosing Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Gore has also picked a running mate whose record on several issues, from school vouchers to capital gains taxes, is more conservative than the vice president's. [Page A19.]</p>
        <p>Although reporters were informed of Mr. Gore's choice around dawn, Mr. Gore did not formally offer the spot to Mr. Lieberman until shortly before noon, catching him on his cell phone as he drove into his driveway in New Haven after giving a speech to the Connecticut A.F.L.-C.I.O.</p>
        <p>''That was the call,'' Mr. Lieberman told reporters waiting at his house. ''It was directly from Al Gore.''</p>
        <p>He said the two had said a short prayer together.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore chose Mr. Lieberman over several other senators, including John Edwards of North Carolina, whose only governmental experience was two years in the Senate, and John Kerry of Massachusetts, whose liberal voting record would surely have become an inviting target for the Republicans.</p>
        <p>Also vetted were Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana and Gov. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman, a 58-year-old Orthodox Jew, is known on the national stage chiefly as the first Democrat to condemn President Clinton in the Lewinsky affair, when he took to the Senate floor and branded Mr. Clinton's behavior ''immoral.'' Mr. Gore, who did not criticize the president throughout the impeachment process, has had a difficult time in his campaign distancing himself from Mr. Clinton's personal behavior, in part because he has also sought to associate himself with the president's positive job performance and the booming economy.</p>
        <p>The choice of Mr. Lieberman, Gore advisers said, recognizes that the Republicans will try to make the president's character a campaign issue, and they hope the move will  shield Mr. Gore from such attacks.</p>
        <p>Gore advisers said the decision, and its timing, a week before the opening of the Democratic convention in Los Angeles, also was grounded in Mr. Gore's recognition that he needed to do something to shake up the race. The latest polls show Mr. Gore trailing Mr. Bush by as much as 17 percentage points.</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign portrayed the selection of Mr. Lieberman as a bold choice because of its historical nature in naming the first Jew to a national ticket, but questions were raised early on and again last night about whether Mr. Lieberman's religion would work against him.</p>
        <p>At the same time, aides said they believed that the decision would demonstrate something the campaign had been trying to convey for months: that Mr. Gore is a ''principled fighter'' who will stand up for those who have been discriminated against.</p>
        <p>Mr. Christopher said that the question of Mr. Lieberman's religion had been raised but that Mr. Gore ''shut it down.''</p>
        <p>Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster, said Mr. Gore was aiming his selection at independent voters and the 15 percent of the electorate that liked Mr. Clinton professionally but not personally. Mr. Hart also said Mr. Lieberman, with his ''moral absolutism,'' could appeal to supporters of Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate for president.</p>
        <p>''Gore is saying, 'I have to find a way of talking to the middle and getting to the middle,' '' he said.</p>
        <p>The centrist message that Mr. Lieberman sends was an important consideration for Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore began interviewing potential running mates in mid-July and had completed them by July 25. He interviewed Mr. Lieberman in Washington at the vice president's residence, where four of the five candidates were sneaked passed television cameras. He interviewed the fifth candidate in New York.</p>
        <p>An overriding factor for Mr. Gore was that he pick someone who could become president on a moment's notice. This became more imperative, advisers said, after Mr. Bush picked Mr. Cheney. Although Gore advisers saw immediate weaknesses in Mr. Cheney's voting record, they also saw that Mr. Bush had picked someone whose ability to step into the Oval Office would not be questioned.</p>
        <p>In an interview today, Mr. Christopher said Mr. Gore had chosen Mr. Lieberman for several reasons. He said he valued his independence. He said the two were personally compatible. And, he said, Mr. Gore regarded Mr. Lieberman as ''a symbol of rectitude.''</p>
        <p>''Gore could visualize his being a very wise counselor in the White House,'' Mr. Christopher said. ''People in the Senate have a very high regard for the values he brings to decisions,'' he said, adding, ''He conveys a very serious purpose.''</p>
        <p>The final selection process spanned several hours on Sunday, when Mr. Gore met at his hotel suite here beginning at 3:30 p.m. with top aides and family members.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore made his decision after midnight. Some in the room asked him if he wanted to sleep on it. He said no.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman said he awoke to news reports that he had been chosen. Monica Dixon, a Gore adviser, told Mr. Lieberman's staff that the reports were based on statements by Democratic officials, but Mr. Lehane said she had not told them whether the accounts were true. When the cameras caught up with him midmorning, the senator said he was still awaiting the call. But he was confident enough to be overjoyed, saying, ''Miracles happen.''</p>
