        <p>One evening last summer, Jonah M. came to see me at my clinic. Because he had a walk-in appointment, I figured he had a minor problem -- maybe a sore throat, a sprained ankle -- that I could help him with right away. When he sat in my examination room, his face was flushed. ''I have a lump on my testicle,'' he announced.</p>
        <p>He was 29, handsome, with unruly brown hair, hazel eyes and a nervous earnestness that was instantly likable. He had a kind of California surfer drawl that bespoke nonchalance, but his darting glances and stammer betrayed his anxiety. The lump was about the size of a pea, he said. It didn't hurt. He had noticed it only the night before.</p>
        <p>I was immediately concerned. A painless testicular mass, if indeed it arises from the testicle, is almost always cancer. (A scrotal mass can turn out to be a varicocele, or benign dilated veins.) Of course, testicular cancer isn't always a painless testicular mass. Sometimes it is a painful lump or tender swelling. Often it is confused with epididymitis, an inflammation of the tubules that ferry sperm out of the testis, or orchitis, which is the generalized inflammation of the testes, usually from an infection.</p>
        <p>While talking with Jonah, I remembered another patient: His disease had been misdiagnosed for months as epididymitis, before an ultrasound found cancer. By then, it had spread to his brain and lungs.</p>
        <p>For Jonah, an exam turned up nothing out of the ordinary other than the lump, which was round, rubbery and about half an inch in diameter. Though I had almost no experience with testicular cancer, I knew this was serious.</p>
        <p>''What do you think?'' Jonah asked.</p>
        <p>I wasn't sure what to say. ''I'm not sure,'' I replied. ''It may be nothing. Let me consult with another doctor.''</p>
        <p>As a medical resident, I went to my supervisor. Concerned, she came with me to examine it. Later, in her office, we discussed what to do. ''It's probably cancer,'' she said.''He needs an ultrasound to confirm it.''  Though excited by my discovery, I was saddened by the burden I was about to lay on Jonah. ''Good pickup,'' she said, aware of my feelings. ''You caught it early. He can probably be cured.''</p>
        <p>When I got back to my exam room 15 minutes later, Jonah was even more on edge. ''What do I have?'' he asked. I decided not to burden him unnecessarily with unconfirmed suspicions. ''I don't know,'' I replied. ''We need more information. Can you come in tomorrow for an ultrasound?'' A wave of alarm washed over him. ''Do I have cancer?'' he whispered.</p>
        <p>''I just don't know at this point,'' I said.  ''We need more information.''</p>
        <p>Testicular cancer is the most common solid tumor in men 15 to 34. The incidence has been rising worldwide, and in the United States 7,000 to 8,000 cases are diagnosed every year. The cause is unknown, though men with a history of viral infections or an undescended testicle seem more at risk.</p>
        <p>Like most cancers, it used to be a death sentence; today, with advances in chemotherapy, it has a cure rate of 90 percent. Even patients whose cancer has metastasized can usually be cured. (Just ask Lance Armstrong, the cyclist who won the Tour de France three years after debilitating chemotherapy for metastatic testicular cancer.) Still, it's a frightening diagnosis, not just because it's cancer, but because the primary treatment is one of the scariest things a man can envision: removal of a testicle.</p>
        <p>Jonah had his ultrasound the next morning. By 5, the urology resident paged me. ''It's cancer,'' he said. The test showed a round, well-defined mass, about five-eighths of an inch in diameter, on top of the right testicle. ''Have you told him?'' I asked. ''I'm about to,'' he replied.</p>
        <p>Jonah later told me how he got the bad news. ''The resident just walked right in with his team and told me,'' he said. ''He was very take-charge and matter of fact. His attitude was, ''This is what you have, and this is what we need to do about it.''</p>
        <p>''But it was sort of like -- boom! -- I wasn't expecting it. The scariest thing is how you can be just fine one minute, and the next have someone tell you you have cancer and need to have your testicle removed.''</p>
        <p>Three days later, Jonah had an orchiectomy, the removal of a testicle. He was out of the hospital that day, and though morphine and codeine relieved the pain, he said later that there was a far more painful reality: ''That my body was not going to be the same.''</p>
        <p>His biggest fear after surgery was sexual inadequacy. Because an orchiectomy often results in a drop in serum testosterone, he was warned that he might need hormone replacement. He never did, and after a few weeks, with the occasional help of Viagra, he resumed normal sexual relations with his girlfriend.</p>
        <p>After the operation, Jonah consulted a cancer specialist, who told him that his kind of testicular cancer had about a 30 percent chance of recurrence and he had two options: dissection of the lymph nodes in his groin and abdomen for evidence of residual disease, or ''watchful waiting,'' in which he would have blood tests and X-rays every month, as well as CAT scans every three months. He waited, and soon it will be a year since Jonah walked into the clinic. So far, so good.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes, late at night, I lie awake thinking. Like, if I don't move around, don't stir, it won't emerge again. Like if I move around too much, I might awaken it. Like it's this beast,'' he said.</p>
        <p>A beast, I agreed: asleep and scary, but one that can be killed.</p>
