        <p>Op-Ed article by law professors Lani Guinier and Gerald Torres says Gov George W Bush is taking credit he does not deserve for remarkably successful '10 percent plan' in Texas, which grants automatic admission to public colleges to all state students graduating in top 10 percent of their high school classes; says plan was adopted following federal appeals court decision outlawing affirmative action at University of Texas, and Bush's sole contribution was that he did not veto plan; says program has spread educational opportunities to poor and minority students, whose college performance has exceeded expectations; suggests that Bush should credit the black and brown leaders who gave him opportunity to crow about plan's success (M)</p>

        <p>At the Republican Convention last week, Colin Powell boldly challenged his party to be inclusive and follow the leadership of George W. Bush in Texas. As a model of inclusive reform, he touted Texas' 10 percent plan, which grants automatic admission to the flagship public colleges to all state students graduating in the top 10 percent of their high school classes.</p>
        <p>Governor Bush calls this plan, which has been remarkably successful, an example of his compassionate conservatism. But this claim would be more convincing if his oratory about the program today had been matched by action when it was being debated.  The Texas Legislature adopted it in 1997, after a federal Court of Appeals ruling, the Hopwood decision, had outlawed affirmative action at the University of Texas. Black and Hispanic state legislators conceived and advocated the plan. Governor Bush's contribution? He didn't veto it.</p>

        <p>At the Republican Convention last week, Colin Powell boldly challenged his party to be inclusive and follow the leadership of George W. Bush in Texas. As a model of inclusive reform, he touted Texas' 10 percent plan, which grants automatic admission to the flagship public colleges to all state students graduating in the top 10 percent of their high school classes.</p>
        <p>Governor Bush calls this plan, which has been remarkably successful, an example of his compassionate conservatism. But this claim would be more convincing if his oratory about the program today had been matched by action when it was being debated.  The Texas Legislature adopted it in 1997, after a federal Court of Appeals ruling, the Hopwood decision, had outlawed affirmative action at the University of Texas. Black and Hispanic state legislators conceived and advocated the plan. Governor Bush's contribution? He didn't veto it.</p>
        <p>During the debate over the bill, Mr. Bush ''never publicly supported the idea,'' says Irma Rangel, the Democratic chairwoman of the higher education subcommittee in the Texas House and the plan's sponsor.</p>
        <p>Texas has about 1,500 high schools. But before the program's inception, the University of Texas at Austin, the most selective state-supported Texas college, filled 75 percent of its freshman seats from about 150 economically privileged suburban and private schools. Under the 10 percent plan, several poor white counties in rural West Texas sent graduates to Austin  for the first time. Moreover, about 300 African-American freshmen were enrolled last year, a 50 percent increase over the year immediately after the Hopwood decision ended affirmative action. The number of Hispanic students has also increased, to more than when affirmative action was the official policy. (It is worth noting that the plan ensures integration at the university level even if the high schools remain segregated. But as some national Democrats point out, the plan is not a panacea for educational reform, especially in states without the extraordinary racial and economic segregation of Texas.)</p>
        <p>Contrary to the fears that they would be unqualified, the 10 percenters exceeded expectations; their collective grade point average in their first year of college was higher than the freshman average for all students  before the Hopwood decision. Part of their achievement comes from the university's efforts to make the school itself smarter. The university  created more small classes for freshmen and allocated full scholarships to high schools with large numbers of poor and working-class students.</p>
        <p>Despite these successes, and despite the high regard in which Governor Bush professes to hold the plan, there are rumblings among Republicans about trying to change it in the next legislative session. They want to restore a requirement that applicants take the SAT, which rewards those who can afford coaching and test preparation and does not predict the qualities of leadership and achievement that the university values. And Governor Bush is notably quiet about these proposed overhauls. ''Hopwood required forward thinking, and he's been passive,'' Michael Olivas, a professor at the University of Houston who specializes in higher education law, says of Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>The 10 percent plan has worked in Texas to spread educational opportunity to those who have had too little of it. It never would have happened without leadership of people of color.  Governor Bush should be bold enough to credit the black and brown leaders who gave him the opportunity to crow about its success today. That would be inclusiveness.</p>
