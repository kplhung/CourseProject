        <p>The quick fix of laser surgery may be freeing more and more people from eyeglasses and contact lenses, but no matter how successful the surgery, their liberation is only temporary. Sooner or later the need for reading glasses descends on all adults -- and from those devices there is still no quick escape.</p>
        <p>Human bodies age at enormously different rates with one single exception: the fine-focus mechanism of the human eye. The lens of the eye and the muscle that surrounds it tick away the passage of time like tiny atomic clocks, slowly deteriorating with a precision so immutable that ophthalmologists say they can accurately estimate patients' ages to within a few years by measuring their ability to focus close up.</p>
        <p>The loss of close-up focus is known as presbyopia, from the Greek for ''elderly vision,'' but the process actually begins in very young adulthood. Children with normal vision can generally focus on objects an inch or so from their eyes, but they lose that ability as teenagers, and by the age of 50 or so, when the eyes can focus no closer than a yard or two away, almost all adults in the world need glasses to read newspapers or thread needles.</p>
        <p>Those who claim they do not, researchers say, are simply unusually skilled at ''blur interpretation,'' fooled by good guesswork into thinking they are exceptions to a universal biological rule.</p>
        <p>Presbyopia is thought to represent not so much a sign of approaching decrepitude as a leftover feature of primate life, when scanning for food or predators on the horizon was a more important survival task for adults than was any close-up work.</p>
        <p>Remarkably, though, for such a longstanding and uniform feature of human biology, scientists are still not sure exactly what causes presbyopia or what might reverse it.</p>
        <p>And for the last five years, they have been arguing heatedly over the risks and the merits of an experimental surgical procedure, scleral expansion surgery, that, despite a host of scientific objections, appears to fix it.</p>
        <p>''It's extremely difficult to study the internal structures of the eye,'' said Dr. Adrian Glasser, an expert in the physiology of the eye at the University of Houston College of Optometry in Texas. ''It's such a finely regulated organ that many of the technologies that have been available to study it have in one way or other disrupted the very thing we're trying to study.''</p>
        <p>Dissections of human specimens have provided only partial snapshots of the focusing process, while animal research is of limited help because few animals focus the way humans do.</p>
        <p>The lens of the eye is suspended in the eyeball right behind the iris, connected by a halo of fibers to a ring of circular muscle. The lens, the fibers and the muscle itself all show changes with the passing years, but exactly which of these changes drives the loss of focusing ability is disputed.</p>
        <p>The lens is the best-studied part of the system. A protein-filled disk, it derives from the same type of cells as do the skin and the hair and, like them, continues to grow throughout life. Unlike other continuously growing structures, though, the lens cannot shed its older cells, or blindness would result. Instead, it slowly gets bigger and thicker, bulging forward into the fluid-filled space that separates it from the iris.</p>
        <p>According to the principles of optics, the bulging curvature should make the lens focus better and better with advancing years. The fact that exactly the opposite occurs means that other powerful factors are operating too, and the clue to presbyopia lies with them.</p>
        <p>Many scientists think that the most important factors are the age-related changes that take place within the lens proteins, making the lens harder and less elastic with the years.</p>
        <p>''The proteins in the lens of an adult are decades old,'' said Dr. Jane F. Koretz, a professor of biophysics at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y. ''They are even older than we are, because the first ones were laid down before we were born. In no other part of the body is that the case.  Everything else gets replaced.''</p>
        <p>The protein molecules in the aging lens slowly change in ways that make them bend light less, Dr. Koretz said. Thus, although it is more spherical, an elderly lens is less and less able to focus the light from nearby objects.</p>
        <p>Age-related changes also take place in the muscles surrounding the lens. Most scientists agree that these muscles do not become weak with age -- it would make no sense for one isolated muscle in the body to slowly give out while all the others continue to work perfectly well. A recent study using high-resolution magnetic resonance to photograph the eye muscles confirmed that the muscles still contracted powerfully in older people who could not focus up close.</p>
        <p>But the geometry of the fibers connecting the muscle to the lens shifts as the lens grows with age, and the fibers themselves appear to harden and become less elastic, a process that also interferes with the ability to focus.</p>
        <p>Exercises purporting to ''strengthen'' the lens muscles are purposeless, Dr. Koretz said, since the muscles are already strong: it is their position and fibrous attachments that may hamper their ability to move.</p>
        <p>If not exercise, then, can any measures help the owner of two aging eyes elude reading glasses?</p>
        <p>Some people find that a satisfactory solution is the creation of ''monovision,'' in which one eye is manipulated to focus well at reading distances (usually with a contact lens or an intraocular lens placed after cataract surgery), while the other focuses for distance. People instinctively grow to favor one eye or the other for different tasks. But while some people are delighted with this solution, Dr. Koretz said, others are plagued by dizziness or nausea, or miss the depth of vision they once had.</p>
        <p>Finding a better fix for presbyopia is rapidly becoming the Holy Grail of experimental ophthalmology, especially as researchers and entrepreneurs begin to calculate the profits that might accrue from curing an annoyance affecting every single adult in the population.</p>
        <p>But the basic disagreements as to why the process occurs have meant that viable solutions are slow to emerge, and are extremely controversial when they do.</p>
        <p>Among the most disputed to date is scleral expansion surgery, a procedure devised by Dr. Ronald Schachar, a Texas ophthalmologist and physicist, in the early 1990's.</p>
        <p>A maverick who has argued that much of what scientists think they know about the focusing mechanism of the eye is actually untrue, Dr. Schachar holds that presbyopia develops only because, as the lens of the eye swells with age, the muscles and fibers surrounding it grow lax, and the system can no longer work effectively.</p>
        <p>By stretching the system out again, Dr. Schachar says, presbyopia can be easily and permanently reversed. He claims to restore tension to the muscle and fibers by surgically implanting four small curved pieces of plastic in the white of the eye a few millimeters from the iris, which, he says, re-establish an effective working distance between the lens muscles and the lens.</p>
        <p>His technique has evoked howls of protest from physiologists who point out that it ignores decades of solid experimental evidence implicating age-related changes within the lens itself as key causes of presbyopia.</p>
        <p>''The scientific community never took scleral expansion surgery seriously,'' Dr. Glasser said.</p>
        <p>But a few hundred patients who have volunteered for the surgery over the last decade in Mexico, Canada and Europe have stymied the procedure's critics with reports that the surgery does indeed seem to restore their ability to see up close.</p>
        <p>In March, the Food and Drug Administration approved preliminary trials of the operation at six sites in the United States, including the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary in Manhattan, where Dr. Barrie D. Soloway, co-medical director for vision correction, will head the studies. Dr. Stephan D. Plager, 60, an ophthalmologist in Santa Cruz, Calif., is also among the investigators who are to take part in the evaluation of surgical expansion surgery. In early May, Dr. Plager himself became a patient, undergoing the procedure in both eyes.</p>
        <p>Two days later, he said, he was performing cataract surgery in his office, and 10  days later, vision still a little blurry but ''getting clearer every day,'' he cheerfully read passages from his local newspaper to a reporter over the telephone.</p>
        <p>''I can't tell you how excited I am,'' he said. ''I haven't seen this well since I was 35.''</p>
        <p>Familiar with all the reasons that his surgery should not work, Dr. Plager said only that while the theory behind the procedure might be flawed, the end result was hard to ignore.</p>
        <p>''The proof that it works will ultimately be in the scientific studies,'' he said, ''but the proof as far as I'm concerned is already on the table. I'm not so courageous -- I'm more of a pragmatist than courageous. I just wanted to get rid of the glasses.''</p>
