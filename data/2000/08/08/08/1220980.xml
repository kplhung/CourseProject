        <p>Giants tight end Pete Mitchell will have arthroscopic surgery on his left knee Tuesday, a procedure that Coach Jim Fassel said was as much to explore the joint as to repair damage to it.</p>
        <p>''It's still a little unclear what the damage is,'' Fassel said. ''If you assume it's what they think it is, a bad strain, then we're looking at three to six weeks to recover. If it's any worse, they'll repair it while they're in there and we'll see. But they have not seen any significant tear of a ligament. There are degrees to the strain, and they want to check other things that are not clear right now.''</p>

        <p>''It's still a little unclear what the damage is,'' Fassel said. ''If you assume it's what they think it is, a bad strain, then we're looking at three to six weeks to recover.

        <p>Fassel said over the weekend that Mitchell would not play in the season opener Sept. 3 against Arizona. Fassel also cautioned that his estimate on Mitchell's recovery period was a guess. It is not unusual for knee ligament strains that require arthroscopic surgery to keep a player out a month or more. Mitchell's 58 receptions last season were the most by a Giants tight end since Mark Bavaro's 66 in 1986.</p>
