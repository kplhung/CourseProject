        <p>West Nile virus appears to be settling in for the long haul.</p>
        <p>Almost one year after the Western Hemisphere debut of the virus sent 62 people to hospitals, eventually killing 7 of them with severe brain inflammation, the bird-carried, mosquito-transmitted disease has struck again, infecting a 78-year-old man from Staten Island.</p>
        <p>The man, who became ill last month  before New York City began this year's round of mosquito spraying, recovered, as the vast majority of infected people do.</p>
        <p>But despite widespread spraying, many scientists expect that a scattering of such cases and a few deaths, mostly in the elderly or infirm, may well become the norm in years to come.</p>
        <p>More slowly than expected, but steadily, the globe-hopping virus is dispersing from last year's focal point in northern Queens, leaving a trail of dead birds that so far extends north to Boston, west to Syracuse and south to Maryland.</p>
        <p>According to virus experts, this pattern indicates that West Nile, which was first identified in Uganda in 1937 and flares up sporadically in Africa, Europe and the Middle East, appears ensconced in the New World.</p>
        <p>Since last fall, dozens of scientists have been scrambling to understand West Nile's origin and destiny as it explores this continent and tests new hosts, decimating some, like crows, leaving others, like pigeons, untouched, and occasionally spilling over into people. Thousands of hours of sleuthing, testing and analysis are only now offering preliminary clues. The big questions are largely unresolved.</p>
        <p>How did the virus get here? Where did it come from? What is its main animal reservoir -- the birds in which it can simmer in sufficient concentrations to be passed by mosquitoes from one host to another? How far will it spread?</p>
        <p>Most important, will West Nile pose a major threat to public health in the United States? The answer to this question, at least so far, appears to be no.</p>
        <p>Where there are answers, they are couched in caveats:</p>
        <p>Though the virus was first identified in Uganda, the source of the outbreak here was probably Israel; the American strain is almost indistinguishable from a virulent strain found in a goose on an Israeli farm in 1998.</p>
        <p>House sparrows -- ubiquitous, dust-colored, one-ounce crumb-snatchers -- are probably a principal reservoir here; new tests at federal laboratories show they can harbor the virus for five days or more at levels high enough to infect mosquitoes that bite them.</p>
        <p>Beyond that, little is known.</p>
        <p>Given the lack of knowledge about what conditions set off the virus's spread to people, spraying near spots where birds died, the major response so far, is akin to shooting at an assailant in the dark, many scientists say. ''But at least it gives you something to do,'' said Dr. Vincent Deubel, a virologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris who has studied West Nile outbreaks for 15 years.</p>
        <p>For now, scientists investigating West Nile say one thing is clear: surveillance and spraying can help cut the risk that people will be infected, but the virus is probably here to stay and will continue to spread.</p>
        <p>''We're beyond containment now,'' said Robert G. McLean, a government biologist studying West Nile's effect on birds. ''We have to live with it and do the best we can.''</p>
        <p>Virus's Arrival in U.S.</p>
        <p>The closest thing to a fact in the investigation of the disease, scientists say, is that it is truly new in the Americas, arriving somewhere around New York City in the months before last summer's outbreak.</p>
        <p>Blood tests in people and birds showed the kind of immune response typical when a body is freshly exposed to an infection, according to federal health officials. Mapping of test results for captured house sparrows -- which do not migrate -- show a hump in the exposure rate in and around Queens and nowhere else.</p>
        <p>And crows, the most vulnerable birds, are almost nowhere to be seen in northern Queens this summer. The population there crashed 90 percent, federal scientists say, while in other areas the birds were hit less hard.</p>
        <p>West Nile virus is closely related to several other mosquito-borne viruses found around the world, including Japanese encephalitis virus and St. Louis encephalitis, which has a similar cycle in birds and mosquitoes and occasionally strikes people across the South and Middle West.</p>
        <p>One big difference is that St. Louis encephalitis is ''silent'' in birds, generally not killing them, scientists say, so there is usually no warning before a human case. For West Nile, at least the American strain, birds, and particularly crows, offer a hint of possible trouble to come.</p>
        <p>The disease has caused epidemics in the past. In West Nile outbreaks in Israel in the 1950's, South Africa in 1974 and Romania in 1996, hundreds and sometimes thousands of people became ill, with 5 percent to 10 percent of those cases proving fatal.</p>
        <p>But far greater numbers of people bitten by infected mosquitoes never know they have been exposed.</p>
        <p>Over all, scientists say, human illness from the virus is likely to remain rare, a result of unusual confluences of mosquito-friendly weather, chance bird movements and other influences that cause the virus to ''amplify'' enough to pose a threat beyond its normal hosts.</p>
        <p>Humans are always likely to remain what biologists call a ''dead-end host,'' one that can be infected, but whose immune system almost always prevents the virus from multiplying enough to be passed back to mosquitoes and then other hosts.</p>
        <p>''It's horrible for the few individuals who've been terribly affected, but I don't see any way that it will cause more than a dribble of cases here,'' said Dr. Paul W. Ewald, an  infectious disease expert at Amherst College.</p>
        <p>Still, West Nile has already defied expectations here. So health officials want to be prepared, should it surprise them again.</p>
        <p>Last fall, the surprise was pleasant. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued an alert from New York to Texas, offering money to states to track what was expected to be a kind of rolling wave of dying birds as the annual southward migration took place and the virus tagged along.</p>
        <p>But no southerly die-off was seen. And since then, the only new discoveries of birds with the virus have come to the north, not the south -- in Syracuse, and just outside of Boston.</p>
        <p>In New York City, health officials put a particular focus on watching for the virus in northern Queens, which was the clear hot zone last summer. This summer, if anything, it appears that Queens is a cold zone.</p>
        <p>Staten Island has been a hot spot, and in late July, West Nile popped up in the heart of Manhattan, forcing the abrupt cancellation of a New York Philharmonic concert in Central Park when some trapped mosquitoes were found with the virus.</p>
        <p>Of growing concern to some biologists is the virus's potential effect on American wild birds, including species like whooping cranes, eagles and ravens, which seem susceptible.</p>
        <p>The imported West Nile strain, and the Israeli strain it most resembles, are more dangerous to birds than other known strains of the virus, said Dr. McLean of the National Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wis., which is run by the United States Geological Survey.</p>
        <p>And the dead birds keep coming. In a telephone interview last Friday, Dr. McLean said a shipment of 25 bird carcasses had just come in from New York, ''and it's going to start picking up more and more.''</p>
        <p>Retracing Virus's Journey</p>
        <p>While trying to stay a step ahead of the virus, scientists are also looking back, trying to retrace how and why it finally found its way across the Atlantic Ocean now.</p>
        <p>This could help change the way health officials guard against other so-called emerging diseases, said Dr. Martin Cetron, an epidemiologist in the federal centers' quarantine division in Atlanta, who is helping to direct the investigation.</p>
        <p>A team based at the centers devised a mathematical model to test the probability of nearly every possibility -- ranging from a sick tourist returning from Tel Aviv to an infected goose to a mosquito confined eight or more hours in an airline cabin.</p>
        <p>The team ended up with a top-10 list of probable sources, Dr. Cetron said, including mostly things like shipments of poultry or pet birds. Only one subset of people ranked in the top 10: travelers from Israel whose immune systems were weak enough to allow the virus to thrive long enough to be picked up by a New York mosquito and spread to birds and, eventually, back to people.</p>
        <p>The research has not yet been published, so Dr. Cetron said he could not disclose details. But he did describe some remarkable statistics the team came upon, which show just how many possible carriers of the virus came to the New York region through the three major airports in the year leading up to the outbreak.</p>
        <p>From July 1998 to June 1999, 5 million people arrived with the metropolitan region as their final destination. Of those, 2.1 million came from places where West Nile has been found.</p>
        <p>There were shipments of imported birds, horses, even frogs, all of which can harbor the virus. More than one million live birds, mostly poultry, were imported in that span.</p>
        <p>The numbers were only the beginning, Dr. Cetron said. The next step was winnowing the data for each suspect animal or human population based on two things: were they arriving from a place with the most similar strain of the virus, and what were the odds that they could have been harboring live virus in their blood when they got here?</p>
        <p>Dr. Cetron stressed that the model was like a compass, pointing in a certain direction, but providing no firm answers.</p>
        <p>Extent of the Threat</p>
        <p>Now that West Nile is here, what is it capable of? No one has found a formula predicting how it makes its leap to a human outbreak from the circumstances now seen in southern New York -- with a scattering of bird deaths, one human case and a few dozen samples of trapped mosquitoes carrying the virus.</p>
        <p>But analysis of past outbreaks in temperate zones in its previous range shows some patterns. It is usually passed from birds to humans in late summer, in cities more than the countryside and in weather or in places that mosquitoes enjoy.</p>
        <p>Some scientists say that conditions are not nearly as primed for a significant human outbreak as they were last year. They note that frequent downpours this summer in the New York metropolitan area are likely to have flushed storm drains that were stagnant last year because of a prolonged drought. Stagnant, nutrient-laden water is a welcome mat for Culex mosquitoes.</p>
        <p>This year, too, many communities revived mosquito control efforts, including widespread use of larvicide, that had ended 10 or 20 years ago for lack of concern.</p>
        <p>Even with all the surveillance and spraying and larviciding under way now, many scientists said, it is likely that when the disease spills into people, it will come as a surprise.</p>
        <p>For St. Louis encephalitis, the infection rate in mosquitoes generally has to reach about 1 in 1,000 for the virus to become a threat to people, experts say, adding that a similar ratio is expected for West Nile. But it is almost impossible to trap enough mosquitoes to detect when this threshold has been reached in a particular place, they say.</p>
        <p>And, ultimately, scientists just do not know whether West Nile, in its new terrain, will play by established rules. ''We don't have the luxury of a track record,'' said Roger S. Nasci, a mosquito expert in the disease-control centers' laboratories at Fort Collins, Colo.</p>
        <p>On the front lines in New York, scientists are racing to keep up with a rising flow of dead birds. In his laboratory near Albany, Dr. Ward B. Stone, the state's wildlife pathologist, conducts triage on a steady flow of crows, herons, hawks, bluejays and other birds, quickly assessing which should be sent on for tests for the new virus and which were killed by conventional causes.</p>
        <p>''From mid-August until after Labor Day, we're going to see this virus amplifying,'' Dr. Stone said.</p>
        <p>He said that he had no doubt that the current frenzied focus on West Nile would eventually ebb, and that it would be added to the growing list of diseases on the fringe -- never as familiar as flu, rabies or meningitis, but something always to consider when a bird dies, or an elderly man spikes a fever in the summertime.</p>
        <p>''It will become one of the diseases in America that we have to watch for,'' Dr. Stone said. ''And we should be getting ready for the next one.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 17, 2000, Thursday  A chart in Science Times on Aug. 8 with an article about West Nile virus misstated the origins of the house sparrow, which can harbor the organism. The bird was introduced to America from Europe; it is not a native species.</p>
