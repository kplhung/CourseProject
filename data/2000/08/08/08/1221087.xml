        <p>''This place gives me deep real estate envy,'' James LaForce, a fashion publicist, said of the waterfront estate of Ken and Basia Nahoum in the Hamptons, at the third annual Super Saturday benefit for the Ovarian Cancer Research Fund.  ''But I just try to breathe through it.''</p>
        <p>Even before the gates had opened on the daylong event, quiet Rose Hill Road in Water Mill had been turned into a luxury vehicle parking lot, with so many Rolls-Royces that the Range Rovers looked like they'd been borrowed from the maid. And with tickets at $500 ($100 for children), the benefit was not for philanthropic amateurs. Those who had ponied up got a kiddie carnival, Elmo from Sesame Street, a fireworks display by the Grucci brothers and a bulging DKNY goody bag.</p>
        <p>The real draw, however, was the afternoon garage sale, which raised $305,000, much of it from designer-donated goods. Super Saturday was started in 1998 by Donna Karan and Liz Tilberis, the Harper's Bazaar editor, who died of ovarian cancer in April 1999. This year, its hosts included Kim Cattrall, Bebe Neuwirth and Kyle MacLachlan. But what's a demicelebrity, really, compared with a bargain?</p>
        <p>''We just sold a pale blue satin top and brown satin A-line from fall for $300,'' said Phoebe Gubelman, Carolina Herrera's publicist and saleswoman for the day. The outfit would run about $1,700 at retail, she said. It was like that at dozens of booths jammed onto the Nahoums' lawn: a $1,200 1950's lamp from Aero for $75; Nicole Farhi sweaters at Gap prices; Kate Spade bags for $100.</p>
        <p>''Is everybody getting what they need?'' Ms. Karan asked, shuttling from a rack where Randolph Duke was holding court with blue painted toenails and a blue Stetson to a table where Shoshanna Lonstein's photo op was being spoiled by a roving Miss America. A herd of models suddenly parted the crowd. They were followed by the ''Sopranos'' star Edie Falco trailing a camera crew. ''Do you think the Hamptons have changed?'' Ms. Falco was asked by a gossip columnist. ''Well,'' said Ms. Falco, a native of West Islip, ''it's a little bit more crowded, a little bit more like Manhattan. But if you know the good places, it's still totally wonderful.'' Asked to reveal the location of some wonderful places, Ms. Falco gave only an enigmatic Carmela Soprano smile: Hamptons omerta.</p>
