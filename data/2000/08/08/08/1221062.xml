        <p>A trade group representing car manufacturers in Brazil accused the Argentine government of reneging on a crucial element of an accord on auto exports, throwing the future of the accord into doubt. The Brazilian government is expected to demand that Argentina revise a decree published last week that increased the percentage of Argentine-made auto parts that a car must have to be traded duty-free inside the Southern American Common Market, Mercosur, to 55 percent from 30 percent. Brazil's automakers say the rule could hinder auto trade between the nations because Argentine cars would become more expensive and fewer would be exported to Brazil. Under the terms of the trade accord, that would reduce Brazil's exports of cars to Argentina.</p>
