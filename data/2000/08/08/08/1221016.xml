        <p>West Nile virus appears to be settling in for the long haul in North America. Since last fall, scientists have been scrambling to understand the virus's origin and destiny as it spreads, decimating some new hosts, like crows, leaving others, like pigeons, untouched, and occasionally spilling over into people. Thousands of hours of sleuthing, testing and analysis are only now offering preliminary clues.</p>
        <p>Many scientists expect that a scattering of human infections and a few deaths will become the norm. But they say the disease appears unlikely to become a significant threat to public health.</p>
