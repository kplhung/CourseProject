        <p>It's too bad, really, that ''Sammy,'' David Spade's new animated sitcom, didn't make its appearance about 30 years ago. That was the moment in history when loutishness could be lovable, as Norman Lear showed us with Archie Bunker. Alas, Mr. Spade's Sammy, who makes his debut tonight on NBC, is a lout born too late.</p>
        <p>When Archie and ''All in the Family'' landed in living rooms in January 1971, the notion of what is today called politically incorrect behavior was still a hazy one; part of the show's scandalousness was that it was educating and defining as it went along. ''See?'' the subtext of each episode read. ''This is what bigotry and insensitivity are, and now let's all share a laugh over someone who's a step behind.''</p>

        <p>It's too bad, really, that ''Sammy,'' David Spade's new animated sitcom, didn't make its appearance about 30 years ago. That was the moment in history when loutishness could be lovable, as Norman Lear showed us with Archie Bunker. Alas, Mr. Spade's Sammy, who makes his debut tonight on NBC, is a lout born too late.</p>
        <p>When Archie and ''All in the Family'' landed in living rooms in January 1971, the notion of what is today called politically incorrect behavior was still a hazy one; part of the show's scandalousness was that it was educating and defining as it went along. ''See?'' the subtext of each episode read. ''This is what bigotry and insensitivity are, and now let's all share a laugh over someone who's a step behind.''</p>
        <p>The title character in ''Sammy,'' who is billed as being based on Mr. Spade's own father, is a sort of hypersexed Archie, spewing bawdy bedroom talk the way Mr. Lear's character served up invective about blacks and Poles. Sammy, who abandoned his wife and three young sons at some point in the distant past, has reappeared in order to mooch off one of those sons, James, who has become a television star. Part of the fun of the show is that Mr. Spade provides the voices of both father and son.</p>
        <p>The notion, apparently, is that Sammy and James form a bond in adulthood that they never had as father-son; Sammy's eccentricity is supposed to be endearing as well as offensive. Today, though, that's too much to ask. There are certainly still plenty of lechers among us, some even as openly lascivious as Sammy, but we're beyond the point where thinking people will put up with them. It's the back half of the ''Arthur'' syndrome at work: Dudley Moore's drunk was amusing and poignant in the original 1981 film but an embarrassment in ''Arthur II'' in 1988.</p>
        <p>This makes ''Sammy'' not quite work, even though many of its component parts are quite good. There is subtle wit and social commentary sprinkled throughout the show, as when James, accepting a drink from his immigrant maid at poolside, asks her:</p>
        <p>''Have you ever had one of those days where things work out better than you could have possibly imagined, and you realize everything you were worried about just disappeared, and the sun is shining and the birds are singing and you just feel completely at peace with the world?''</p>
        <p>The maid answers, ''Almost every day is like that for me.'' Then she adds deferentially, ''I'll go clean the toilets now.''</p>
        <p>Also welcome is the way the animated format, unencumbered by the pacing requirements of a laugh track and/or live audience, allows such lines to be delivered the way they would be in real life: as fleeting asides, or muttered, or thought rather than spoken. Thus Sammy, after making a throat-scarring bear growl during a barroom brawl with another son, Gary (Bob Odenkirk), can pause just long enough to say under his breath, ''Note to self: Don't make bear noise; it hurts.''</p>
        <p>The voice work in ''Sammy'' is  notable. Maura Tierney as James's gorgeous assistant, Andy Dick as his agent, Harland Williams as the third brother and others catch their characters nicely.</p>
        <p>Especially impressive is Mr. Spade's rich and nuanced rendition of Sammy, who is braying vulgarly one minute and whimpering pitifully the next. With the animation nothing special and the plot lines fairly standard sitcom stuff, the best way to take in ''Sammy'' might be with eyes closed, just focusing on the vocal techniques. Maybe then it would be possible to drift back to those salacious, sexist days of yore.</p>
        <p>SAMMY  NBC, tonight at 8:30  (Channel 4 in New York)</p>
