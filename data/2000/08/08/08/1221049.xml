        <p>Thousands of New Yorkers have lost their telephone service since early Sunday, as vandals slashed telephone cables in what the police department is investigating as possible acts of sabotage in support of a workers' strike.</p>
        <p>The waves of vandalism come amid negotiations between Verizon Communications, the nation's largest local and wireless telephone company, and the two unions that represent more than 86,000 workers who are on strike in a 13-state region from Maine to Virginia.</p>
        <p>As of yesterday evening, the police reported at least 72 incidents of vandalism -- most of which involved property damage like severed cables -- or harassment of Verizon managers.</p>
        <p>The Bronx was the hardest-hit borough, said a Verizon spokeswoman, Maureen Flanagan. Ms. Flanagan estimated that about 3,000 customers lost service in the Bronx on Sunday and yesterday. As Verizon managers worked overtime to repair about 600 of those lines, vandals were also hard at work, and the damages continued to pile up.</p>
        <p>Shortly before noon in the Bronx yesterday, two managers responding to a service call parked their truck in front of 21 Asch Loop, in Co-op City. While they were gone, police officials said, someone set the truck on fire and the managers returned to find firefighters extinguishing the flames.</p>
        <p>Manhattan was also heavily hit, with 32 reports of vandalism and harassment yesterday related to telephone company operations, police officials said. In one case, 500 to 600 residential customers lost phone service when cables were cut in the basement of a fiber optic station at 328 East 15th Street on Sunday, the police said, adding that it could take about three days to restore service.</p>
        <p>When Gloria Velasquez, 72, picked up the telephone on Sunday to call her two sons, the line was dead.</p>
        <p>''I screamed, 'Ave Maria,' and slammed the phone down on the hook,' '' Ms. Velasquez recalled yesterday as she prepared pork chops in her East 15th Street apartment. ''I'm very angry because I have asthma and if I need help and I can't get in touch with anyone, I'd be cooked.''</p>
        <p>Although another resident of the neighborhood, Liz Short, 25, has a cellular telephone, she said the slashed cables were disrupting her social life nonetheless. ''I can't check my e-mails and I can't receive all my phone calls,'' said Ms. Short, who  explained that she did not give out her cellular telephone number to everybody. ''I'm kind of angry.''</p>
        <p>As of late yesterday, no arrests had been made in connection with any of the local incidents.</p>
        <p>Union leaders sought to distance themselves and their members from the damages.</p>
        <p>''We don't condone vandalism; we never did, we never will,'' said Al Luzzi, the vice president of Local 1101 of the Communications Workers of America, which covers Manhattan and the Bronx. ''Vandalism never made a strike one day shorter than it's going to be.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Luzzi conjectured that managers might be responsible for the vandalism, because they are the ones having to work during the strike. ''Union people build things. They fix things. They don't destroy things.''</p>
        <p>Police officials stopped short of drawing a link between the vandalism and the workers' strike. ''Anyone who damages or performs acts of criminal mischief against telephone facilities will be arrested,'' said Deputy Chief Thomas P. Fahey. But, he added, ''It would be very difficult for a police department to prevent an inside job.''</p>
        <p>Verizon said it was offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to an arrest for vandalism.</p>
        <p>Ms. Flanagan, the company spokeswoman, said Verizon did not know how many of its 25 million residential and business customers in the 13-state region had lost service because the employees who would have compiled such figures were either filling in for strikers or on strike themselves. But she said vandals had hit hardest in New York.</p>
        <p>''When there's someone out there cutting our cables, it makes it very difficult to provide a level of service that our customers deserve,'' she said.</p>
