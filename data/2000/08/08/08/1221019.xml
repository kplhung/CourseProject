        <p>In Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Vice President Al Gore has managed to choose as his running mate an Orthodox Jew whom many Christians, and especially conservative evangelicals, regard as an ally on a number of social and moral issues.</p>
        <p>Although he frequently wears a yarmulke on his head, Mr. Lieberman is seen by some Christians as a kindred spirit for his willingness to wear his religion on his sleeve. His talk of the Talmud's inspiring both his values and his votes has often been cited by those Christians who believe that the Bible ought to guide public policy.</p>
        <p>''For a lot of serious Christians in America, the fact that he's an observant Jew would be viewed very positively,'' said the Rev. Richard John Neuhaus, a Roman Catholic priest who is editor of First Things, a neoconservative religious journal. ''America is incorrigibly and confusedly a religious nation, and the fact that a person is viewed as religiously devout, someone who lives what he believes, is clearly a plus.''</p>
        <p>Political scholars interviewed yesterday generally dismissed the notion that any anti-Semitism among Christians, who account for 85 percent of voters, would be much of a factor. America, they said, has changed. In 1937, only 46 percent of voters surveyed by Gallup said they would vote for a qualified Jewish candidate for president. By 1999, 92 percent of voters said they would; only 6 percent said they would not, and the rest had no opinion.</p>
        <p>That result, reflected in other  polls, ''suggests that even if there is a hidden bias that people are unwilling to admit to pollsters, it is not substantial enough to make a difference,'' said John C. Green, director of the Ray Bliss Institute of Applied Politics at the University of Akron.</p>
        <p>There are anti-Semitic, racist groups that call themselves Christian ''churches,'' Mr. Green said, but they have few adherents and are so alienated from politics that in many cases their members do not vote at all. Some African-Americans harbor anti-Semitic attitudes borne of years of conflict, he said, but not enough to change the vote of a constituency that is usually solidly Democratic.</p>
        <p>In the Senate, Mr. Lieberman has championed some of the issues dear to Catholics, many mainline Protestants and conservative Christian evangelicals. He has supported school vouchers and pushed for the State Department to punish countries for religious persecution. He has castigated the entertainment industry for producing violent music and television programs. And his  Senate speech in 1998 denouncing President Clinton on the ground of  sexual immorality won praise from Christian clergy.</p>
        <p>''I think the vice president made an excellent choice,'' the Rev. Jerry Falwell, who is supporting Gov. George W. Bush, said in an interview yesterday. ''It is a public acknowledgment that his candidacy has two great needs. One is credibility, which Mr. Lieberman brings to anything he touches. The second is an everlasting divorce from Bill Clinton, and this is that.''</p>
        <p>The Rev. R. Albert Mohler Jr., president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Ky., said, ''American evangelicals respect persons of great moral substance and conviction, and we certainly share with Senator Lieberman a great moral heritage to which we are both committed, in terms of the Old Testament -- the Hebrew Scriptures -- and, most essentially, the Ten Commandments.''</p>
        <p>Still, Dr. Mohler, Father Neuhaus and others said that having Scripture  in common was not enough. Like Mr. Gore, Mr. Lieberman is a supporter of both abortion rights and gay rights, and many Catholics and evanglicals who oppose abortion and homosexuality will not vote for a Gore-Lieberman ticket.</p>
        <p>The evangelical vote is far from monolithic, however. There are evangelicals who care more about poverty than abortion, more about damage to the environment than homosexuality.</p>
        <p>''Not everyone who is pro-life uses that issue as a litmus test for who they are going to vote for,'' said Rabbi Yechiel Eckstein, an Orthodox Jew who founded the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews, based in Chicago. Mr. Lieberman was previously co-chairman of the group's Washington affiliate, the Center for Jewish and Christian Values, with Daniel R. Coats of Indiana,  a conservative evangelical Christian who was himself then a senator.</p>
        <p>''I think there are many, many Americans who may be committed to the pro-life platform but who give equal value to violence on TV, to morality in the public square and integrity in the White House,'' Rabbi Eckstein said. ''And I think they would look to somebody like Joe Lieberman for leadership in those areas.''</p>
