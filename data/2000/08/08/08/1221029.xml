        <p>Joseph I. Lieberman's life will never be quite the same now that Al Gore has tapped him to be his running mate, but one thing seems likely to remain unchanged: Mr. Lieberman can continue to run for re-election to the Senate, a race he is an overwhelming favorite to win, while also running in the tougher race for vice president.</p>
        <p>Nothing in Connecticut law prevents Mr. Lieberman from running for both offices simultaneously.  And, as news of his selection by Mr. Gore swept across the country today, state Democratic Party officials said that they expected Mr. Lieberman to be on the ballot for both offices this November.</p>
        <p>The state Democratic Party chairman, Edward L. Marcus, said that Mr. Lieberman ''was inclined'' to remain in the Senate race. Other state party officials and aides to Mr. Lieberman said they also believed he would stay on the ballot for the Senate, following the precedent of two senators and vice-presidential nominees from Texas, Lloyd Bentsen in 1988 and Lyndon B. Johnson in 1960.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman is immensely popular in Connecticut and has long been viewed as a heavy favorite to win a third term in the Senate by trouncing a little-known opponent, Mayor Philip A. Giordano of Waterbury. But while Republicans and Democrats said today that they still expected Mr. Lieberman to be re-elected, his decision to seek two offices at once carries several political risks.</p>
        <p>The obvious benefit to Mr. Lieberman is that he can hedge his bet. Should the Democrats fail to defeat George W. Bush, he could keep his job in the Capitol. Predictably, Republicans in Connecticut and elsewhere pounced quickly today, calling this evidence that Mr. Lieberman lacks full confidence that the Democratic ticket will prevail in November.</p>
        <p>And even Mr. Lieberman's best-case outcome, that the Democrats win the White House and he also wins re-election to the Senate, has a potential drawback for his party. Although he can run for both offices, he cannot serve in both. If Mr. Lieberman is inaugurated as vice president in January, Connecticut's Republican governor, John G. Rowland, will pick someone to serve in the Senate until the next statewide election, in November 2002.</p>
        <p>It was unclear tonight whether Mr. Gore or Democratic leaders in Washington would pressure Mr. Lieberman to give up his Senate re-election campaign. Under state election rules, Mr. Lieberman has until Oct. 27 to quit the race and be replaced by a Democratic nominee. But state party leaders said it was already too late to hold a primary, and that if Mr. Lieberman dropped out, a replacement would have to be chosen at a special convention.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rowland, during a news conference this afternoon at the State Capitol, said that he had not yet considered whom he would appoint. And although he praised Mr. Lieberman, he described the prospect of appointing someone as far-fetched because he said he expected Mr. Bush to win the White House.</p>
        <p>Still, if the seat comes open, it is virtually certain that Mr. Rowland will appoint a fellow Republican, either one of the state's two Republican members of Congress, Nancy Johnson of New Britain or Christopher Shays of Stamford, or his lieutenant governor, M. Jodi Rell. Mr. Rowland could select himself, but at today's news conference he pledged not to do so, saying he had no interest in the job.</p>
        <p>''That's the one definite I can give you,'' he said. ''I have no interest in going to Washington, and I also think it would be self-serving for any governor to appoint himself or herself to the U.S. Senate. I want to finish this job.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Marcus, the state Democratic chairman, said his party was researching whether the State Legislature had the authority to enact a bill calling for a special election for the United States Senate sooner than the November 2002 election.</p>
        <p>He said he believed Mr. Rowland would support such a bill and sign it.</p>
        <p>One Republican whom officials in both parties said Mr. Rowland was unlikely to choose as the unelected senator was Mr. Giordano, the man who is actually running against Mr. Lieberman this year. Mr. Giordano, whose long-shot candidacy was initially opposed by the governor and state Republican leaders, moved quickly today to take advantage of the national spotlight on Connecticut.</p>
        <p>''He can't be a man of two countries, if you will,'' Tim Longino, Mr. Giordano's campaign manager, said of Mr. Lieberman. ''That is the issue of the campaign now. We don't believe he represented us enough as U.S. Senator, never mind as a vice president, and don't think he should run for both seats at the same time.''</p>
        <p>He said Mr. Giordano was enjoying the newfound interest in his candidacy.</p>
        <p>''People are calling now to find out who Phil Giordano is,'' Mr. Longino said, adding that Mr. Giordano would hold in news conference in Hartford on Tuesday to attack Mr. Lieberman's voting record in the Senate. ''He has been on 'CNN Live' today,'' Mr. Longino said. ''He'll be on all of the nationwide networks this week.''</p>
        <p>Connecticut's senior senator, Christopher J. Dodd, said today that he had urged Mr. Lieberman to remain on the ballot for the Senate and that he was confident that the Democrats would eventually reclaim the seat in a special election. He also said it would be difficult to find a replacement candidate for November. ''It's 12 weeks away,'' Mr. Dodd said. ''Joe is our strongest candidate for re-election to the Senate.'' He added, ''I don't think it's fair to deprive him of that.''</p>
        <p>As potential Democratic candidates to succeed Mr. Lieberman, Senator Dodd named two members of Congress, John B. Larson and Rosa DeLauro, and the state attorney general, Richard Blumenthal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blumenthal said that he was not sure whether Mr. Lieberman should run for both offices, but he was confident that the law allowed it.  State law, he said, does not address the issue of dual candidacies for federal office and, therefore, by not banning it, effectively permits it.</p>
        <p>Bob Ward, a Republican state representative, said he believed Mr. Gore was trying to distance himself from President Clinton, to no avail. ''There is no question that Joe Lieberman is an honorable and trustworthy individual,'' he said. ''I think Joe Lieberman's problem is that his running mate is Al Gore.''</p>
