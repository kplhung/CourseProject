        <p>A new study offers still more evidence that when it comes to health care, black and white patients do not always get equal treatment.</p>
        <p>Circulation, the American Heart Association journal, is reporting today that blacks who have had heart attacks are less likely to receive proven treatments to prevent a recurrence, even when they are as inexpensive as aspirin or beta-blockers.</p>
        <p>The study, conducted at the Georgetown University, also found smaller gaps in the treatment of women versus men and low-income people versus higher ones.</p>
        <p>Racial disparities in treatment have increasingly become an issue in medicine.</p>
        <p>In this study, researchers evaluated what treatments patients were given when they entered hospitals and when they left. They looked at 169,079 Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized from 1994 to 1996.</p>
        <p>For patients who have just had heart attacks, so-called clot-buster drugs and aspirin are known to improve the chances of survival. After discharge, aspirin and beta-blockers can prevent a recurrence.</p>
        <p>The study found, for example, that in the hospital, about 63 percent of the white patients studied were given clot-busting drugs, but only about 56 percent of the black ones were. When the patients left, about 55 percent of the whites got prescriptions for beta-blockers, while about 50 percent of the blacks did.</p>
        <p>While the researchers said they did not believe there was conscious discrimination, they said more study was needed to determine why the disparities occurred.</p>
