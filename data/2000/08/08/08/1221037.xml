        <p>DURING the 1990's, defenders of the city's costly recycling program deflected criticism with a mantra: just wait until Fresh Kills closes. Once the city lost that cheap place to dump trash, they predicted, recycling would become the most practical alternative.</p>
        <p>Fresh Kills is now set to close, and the Department of Sanitation has done the number-crunching for a new plan. The trash that is now shipped by open barges to Staten Island will be loaded into airtight containers, then shipped by barge or rail to other states.</p>
        <p>The new environmental precautions, shipping expenses and landfill fees will indeed raise the cost of burying trash. But somehow recycling will still be even more expensive, according to the department's projections.</p>
        <p>Collecting recyclable material costs more than collecting trash, because there's less material to pick up at each stop, and the materials themselves aren't worth enough to offset that expense. The city receives only $5 to $10 per ton of paper, and it must pay recycling companies $45 per ton to accept metal, glass and plastics.</p>
        <p>The Department of Sanitation projects that in fiscal year 2002, even assuming the recycling program becomes more efficient, it will cost the city about $12.5 million: an extra $13 for each of the nearly one million tons that are to be recycled instead of buried.</p>
        <p>The city's recycling program was begun in 1993 with the expectation of saving money. The City Council formally declared recycling to be ''economically desirable'' and even issued a five-year plan mandating precisely how many tons were to be recycled annually.</p>
        <p>But the budget savings projected by the sanitation department were replaced by ''incremental costs,'' as the sanitation department noted in several studies during the 1990's computing how much extra it was spending per year to recycle material rather than bury it. The added annual expense ranged from $70 million to $127 million.</p>
        <p>That means that if New Yorkers had simply thrown away all their garbage instead of sorting paper and washing out bottles and cans during the last seven years, the city would have saved at least $500 million. The savings would have been enough to build a dozen new public schools or to put $15,000 worth of computers in each existing classroom. It might have been used to increase the parks department's operating budget by about 50 percent each year.</p>
        <p>City officials now acknowledge that past projections were too optimistic, but they expect recycling to become more cost-efficient as more New Yorkers sort their garbage. ''The gap is narrowing between recycling and landfilling,'' said Robert Lange, director of the sanitation department's Bureau of Waste Prevention, Reuse and Recycling. ''Within the next decade it will be cheaper to recycle.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps this time the optimistic projections will be correct, but there are still reasons for doubt. The planners are assuming that New Yorkers, who now recycle 20 percent of their trash, will raise that rate to 25 percent by 2002 and then go still higher.</p>
        <p>MAYBE they will, but maybe they'll just tire of working as unpaid garbage sorters, especially if they realize how little the end product is worth. Recycling becomes hopelessly uneconomical if, unlike the department's planners, you account for the time and space that New Yorkers are forced to donate to recycling. Paying for that labor and storage space would add at least $1,500 per ton to the cost of recycling, by my calculations.</p>
        <p>Even recycling's environmental justifications can be problematic, at least on the local level, since the program creates more truck traffic and therefore more air pollution. If there were no recycling program, the city would need fewer trucks over all for curbside collections, because trucks work more efficiently when they pick up all the trash at once instead of in two or three separate collections.</p>
        <p>There would also be no need for the private trucks that now carry recyclables from sorting centers here to recycling plants outside the city. Instead, all the trash would make a single relatively short truck trip to a local transfer station for shipment by barge or rail.</p>
        <p>Many environmentalists would say that any local drawbacks are outweighed by the global benefits of recycling, but the value of those benefits is debatable. After spending half a billion dollars and donating countless hours of free labor to a program that's still uneconomical, some New Yorkers might prefer to heed the environmental tenet, Think globally, act locally.</p>
