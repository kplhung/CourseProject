        <p>Republicans praised the selection of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman as Vice President Al Gore's running mate today but quickly seized on votes that differed from Mr. Gore's positions and said Mr. Lieberman's conservative record would not help the ticket with core Democratic voters.</p>
        <p>But spokesmen for labor unions, teachers and environmental and abortion rights groups enthusiastically spoke out for Mr. Lieberman and brushed off his occasional votes against their positions.</p>
        <p>In Austin, Tex., Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Gov. George W. Bush, called Mr. Lieberman of Connecticut  ''a good man who Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney respect.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fleischer added, ''From Social Security reform to missile defense, tort reform to parental notification, from school choice to affirmative action, Al Gore has chosen a man whose positions are more similar to Governor Bush's positions than to his own.''</p>
        <p>Eddie Mahe, a veteran Republican consultant, said the choice probably had ''a small political downside'' for Mr. Gore. It ''further erodes his support on the left,'' Mr. Mahe said.</p>
        <p>Clifford May, chief spokesman for the Republican National Committee, called the choice ''a stick in the eye to the Democratic labor base, the teachers union bosses.''</p>
        <p>Mr. May said the selection ''does nothing to solidify his base, and he needs to.'' Only 70 percent of Democrats support Mr. Gore, according to a new CBS News Poll, while 88 percent of Republicans back Mr. Bush. Mr. May and Ed Gillespie, a Republican consultant, both said they looked forward to the first ''Gore-Lieberman debate.''</p>
        <p>But Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader, disagreed. ''I think it will excite the base,'' Mr. Daschle said, ''because it is a clear indication that Al Gore is determined to win this election.''</p>
        <p>And spokesmen for core Democratic constituencies backed Mr. Daschle up.</p>
        <p>Sandra Feldman, president of the American Federation of Teachers, called Mr. Lieberman a man of ''great integrity,'' and ''a very strong supporter of labor and of education.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Feldman minimized the senator's votes for school vouchers, saying, ''He voted just a couple of times for an experiment.''</p>
        <p>Steven Rosenthal, political director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said that despite differences over trade issues and school vouchers, Mr. Lieberman ''has had a very strong voting record on behalf of working families.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosenthal said the choice ''helps make this an election about things that matter to workers: Social Security, health care, education,'' instead of ''muddying the water with a lot of talk about morality.''</p>
        <p>Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, another major force in the Democratic coalition, was equally enthusiastic, calling the selection ''bold and excellent.''</p>
        <p>''It's also a statement about Gore's commitment to pro-choice values and a woman's right to choose,'' Ms. Michelman said.</p>
        <p>Mr. May's office released a letter that it said Mr. Lieberman wrote in 1989, including this statement: ''I also support a requirement that parents of a minor be notified before an abortion is performed.'' But Ms. Michelman dismissed the letter's release as a ''desperate tactic,'' saying that whatever Mr. Lieberman may have thought then, what mattered was that on two subsequent occasions he voted in the Senate against  parental notification measures involving abortion.</p>
        <p>There was no shortage of applause from Democrats. Al From, president of the moderate Democratic Leadership Council, called Mr. Lieberman ''a terrific choice for America, the Democratic Party and the New Democrat Movement.''</p>
        <p>And the Senate's leading liberal, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, said: ''Joe Lieberman is a giant in the Senate. He's worked brilliantly, effectively and tirelessly to promote the highest values of public service and integrity in public office.''</p>
        <p>Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the other Democrat from Connecticut, called the selection ''a reach to the future.'' Mr. Dodd recalled attending the 1960 Democratic convention in Los Angeles with his parents, and hearing people complain, ''You can't elect a Catholic president.''</p>
        <p>''I think there is some symmetry that 40 years later in that same city we are going to nominate an Orthodox Jew,'' Mr. Dodd said.</p>
        <p>Generally, Republicans would not discuss the factor that made the choice historic: Mr. Lieberman's religion. ''I think it's irrelevant,'' Mr. May said.</p>
        <p>Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League, said that while ''approximately 12 percent of the American people have strong anti-Semitic views, these people don't vote anyway.'' With at least 70 percent of Jews already voting Democratic, he said, there was little room for Democratic gains there.</p>
        <p>Called the selection ''wise'' and ''dramatic,'' Mr. Foxman said, ''It says a lot about America. From our perspective, I think it's a milestone.''</p>
        <p>While the Bush campaign gave the impression that the selection did not trouble it, William Kristol, a Republican strategist and publisher of The Weekly Standard, said the choice destroyed the argument that the Democrats were seeking ''a third term for Clinton-Gore.'' He said it made the ''character issue considerably less relevant.''</p>
        <p>The news ''stopped the Bush story in its tracks,'' Mr. Kristol said. ''It ended the 'bounce' today.''</p>
