        <p>Life at the top is not rosy for the MetroStars right now. After going nine games without a loss to solidify their position at the top of Major League Soccer's Eastern Division, the MetroStars suffered their second consecutive loss on Sunday in Chicago, a 3-1 decision to the Fire.</p>
        <p>The MetroStars' attack remains the most productive in the division with 42 goals, but it was out of sync in the loss in Chicago and also the 3-2 overtime loss in Washington last Wednesday. And the defense is starting to show signs of vulnerability without the central defender Daniel Hernandez, who is out for the season with an injured right knee.</p>

        <p>Life at the top is not rosy for the MetroStars right now. After going nine games without a loss to solidify their position at the top of Major League Soccer's Eastern Division, the MetroStars suffered their second consecutive loss on Sunday in Chicago, a 3-1 decision to the Fire.</p>
        <p>The MetroStars' attack remains the most productive in the division with 42 goals, but it was out of sync in the loss in Chicago and also the 3-2 overtime loss in Washington last Wednesday. And the defense is starting to show signs of vulnerability without the central defender Daniel Hernandez, who is out for the season with an injured right knee.</p>
        <p>''We need to regroup as a team and get back to basics,'' Coach Octavio Zambrano said. ''We're not looking for excuses, but the absence of Daniel is hurting us. We're looking for help in that area.''</p>
        <p>Lothar Matthaus, who could end up playing there, is still nursing his strained back, which forced him to miss the past two games. He is expected back on Saturday to face the New England Revolution, which is second in the division. The MetroStars (13-9-2 and 41 points) are still 8 points ahead of the Revolution (9-10-6).</p>
        <p>The MetroStars will be without Tab Ramos and Roy Myers, each of whom will be serving the one-game suspension they earned after being ejected in the loss to the Fire. The MetroStars were not counting on Myers for Saturday's game anyway because he has been recalled for duty with the Costa Rican national team.</p>
        <p>Myers will play against Venezuela in a friendly on Thursday and against Guatemala in a World Cup qualifying game Aug. 15, the night before the United States faces Barbados.</p>
        <p>The MetroStars have a United States Open Cup quarterfinal game tomorrow night in Columbus, Ohio, against the Crew, which has split two games with the MetroStars in M.L.S. action this season.</p>
        <p>Matthaus may see limited action against Columbus because Zambrano wants to be certain that Matthaus is healthy before he plays in a league game.</p>
        <p>MAJOR LEAGUE SOCCER</p>
        <p>The Los Angeles Galaxy started the season without a loss in the first 10 games (5-0-5) but struggled gloriously after the arrival of the Mexican Luis Hernandez, at $4 million the league's most expensive player. Injuries and national-team duty put the Galaxy in a predicament in recent weeks.</p>
        <p>But the Galaxy appears to be recovering. Its 5-1 triumph on Saturday in Kansas City, which has the most points (44) in M.L.S., proved that Galaxy is on the upside again. Hernandez, known as El Matador, and his teammates demolished a defense that had allowed only 18 goals in 23 games. Hernandez led the attack with a goal and two assists, and the Galaxy (11-7-7) moved within 4 points of the Wizards (13-6-5).</p>
        <p>Tampa Bay was without Mamadou Diallo, the league's leading scorer in points (38) and goals (18) in the game against Dallas because of a suspension and a fine for arguing with a referee after a loss to Chicago last week. Manny Lagos made up for Diallo's absence by scoring both goals in Tampa Bay's 2-1 victory.</p>
        <p>The long-shot bid by the three-time champion D.C. United to make the playoffs got longer after a 3-1 loss to Miami dropped United's record to 6-14-6, second worst (to San Jose) in the 12-team league. The only encouraging development for D.C. United is that four of its last six games will be in Washington. The bad news is that the last four games are against division rivals, where United's record is 1-6-1.</p>
        <p>San Jose's 2-0 loss to Colorado was its fourth in a row and dropped the Earthquakes further out of playoff contention. They are 11 points out of the last playoff spot, which is currently occupied by the Dallas Burn. Eight of the league's 12 teams make the playoffs.</p>
        <p>All eight teams left in the quarterfinals of the United States Open Cup are from M.L.S. and they will all be playing tomorrow night. Dallas will visit Chicago, San Jose will be at Los Angeles and Miami will be at D.C. United.</p>
        <p>UNITED STATES MEN</p>
        <p>Coach Bruce Arena will release the roster tomorrow for next week's World Cup qualifying game against Barbados in Foxboro, Mass. As many as seven new players could be on it.</p>
        <p>Arena was unhappy with the performance of several players in the tie in Guatemala and the loss in Costa Rica in the first two games that put the Americans in last place in their regional qualifying semifinal group. He was also unhappy with the way some players performed in M.L.S. over the weekend.</p>
        <p>''A number of the players put up a red flag,'' Arena said. ''We'll have some new players for Barbados.''</p>
        <p>Four players have recovered from injuries and will be on the roster, along with goalkeeper Tony Meola, who will be invited for the first time for the current series of qualifying games. Meola has been the best goalkeeper in M.L.S. this season and could see action against Barbados because the only other goalkeeper on the roster will be Brad Friedel.</p>
        <p>Players who have recovered from injuries and will be named to the team for the first time for this stage of the qualifying games are forwards Joe-Max Moore (knee) and Brian McBride (cheekbone), and defenders Jeff Agoos (knee) and Carlos Llamosa (knee). They could all start against Barbados, along with Ramos and Eddie Pope. These two played in the 1-1 tie with Guatemala but missed the 2-1 loss in Costa Rica because of injuries.</p>
