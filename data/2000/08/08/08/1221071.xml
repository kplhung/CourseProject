        <p>BROOKLYN: TEENAGER KILLED  A 15-year-old boy was shot and killed at his cousin's Williamsburg apartment, the authorities said yesterday. The police are seeking the victim's cousin, also 15, for questioning. Police said the cousin had been with the victim and an unidentified 20-year-old woman on Sunday evening. The woman left briefly and returned around 7:30 p.m. to find one boy shot and the other gone.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: SENTENCING IN 1997 STABBING  A Manhattan man who used a bayonet to kill his former girlfriend's father, a retired police officer, was sentenced yesterday in Manhattan Supreme Court to 22 years to life in prison. The man, Thomas Kelly, 49, was convicted of second-degree murder on May 8 for the 1997 stabbing death of William Hageman, 51. Mr. Hageman had tried to intervene as his daughter, Dawn Kaye Hageman, and Mr. Kelly argued.</p>

        <p>BROOKLYN: FAKE INSPECTORS  Two men posing as inspectors are knocking on doors in Brooklyn and asking to be let in to test for lead in drinking water, the city's Department of Environmental Protection said. But city employees do not go to residences without an appointment, except in emergencies, said Geoffrey Ryan, a department spokesman. Two residents in the Mill Basin section reported such visits, Mr. Ryan said yesterday, but they did not allow the imposters inside.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: ETHICS VIOLATION  The city's Conflict of Interest Board has fined the cultural affairs chief $500 for holding a political fund-raiser and inviting people who had business dealings with the city, the board announced yesterday. The commissioner of the Department of Cultural Affairs, Schuyler G. Chapin, held the party in October for Fran Reiter, who was a candidate for mayor. Mr. Chapin admitted that he had violated a city law and an ethics law by seeking donations from people who had dealings with the city.</p>

        <p>SYRACUSE: SENTENCING IN LOVE TRIANGLE  A man who admitted killing his estranged wife's female lover because he believed she had broken up his marriage was sentenced yesterday to 18 years in prison. The man, Ralph Kazmirski, 30, pleaded guilty in July to a reduced charge of first-degree manslaughter for shooting Carol Lozott, 35, once in the chest.</p>

        <p>CONNECTICUT</p>
        <p>HARTFORD: H.M.O. OMBUDSMAN NAMED  Gov. John G. Rowland named Gerald E. Martens yesterday to be Connecticut's first independent ombudsman for managed health care. As the $90,000-a-year ombudsman, Mr. Martens will advise patients of their rights, help them appeal insurance company decisions that affect them, and ensure that patients' privacy is protected. He will also have the authority to obtain company records.</p>

        <p>HARTFORD: NEW TRIAL FOR CHILD ABUSER  The State Supreme Court ruled yesterday that a man convicted of sexually assaulting his girlfriend's 8-year-old daughter was denied a fair trial. The high court found that the prosecutor had violated the rights of the defendant, Andrew Alexander, when she said in closing arguments that the victim, now 12, was young and therefore honest. Such statements are likely to sway a jury ''without properly considering the facts of evidence,'' Judge Flemming L. Norcott Jr. wrote in the unanimous decision. The Stamford prosecutor's office did not return a message seeking comment.</p>

        <p>NEW JERSEY</p>
        <p>TRENTON: MORE DEAD CROWS FOUND  Thirty-eight more dead crows, all of them found in New Jersey in late July, have been reported killed by the West Nile virus, the state's Department of Health and Senior Services said yesterday. Earlier in the summer, 15 crows were killed by the virus. The latest outbreak continued to be concentrated in Bergen County, with 19 crows found there, compared with 10 in the earlier outbreak. But 8 crows killed in the latest outbreak were found in Passaic, Monmouth and Essex Counties, said Marilyn Riley, a spokeswoman for the department. She said officials expected the disease to start peaking this month.</p>

        <p>COLTS NECK: TORNADO SUSPECTED  The National Weather Service said it was probable that a tornado touched down here during a heavy storm that passed through central New Jersey yesterday in the late afternoon and early evening. An official said that meteorologists would be in Colts Neck today to investigate. Anthony Gigi, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Mount Holly, said utility poles and 50-foot trees were knocked down. Harry Conover, Monmouth County's emergency management coordinator, said that no one was hurt. The affected area was ''a couple miles wide and about five miles long,'' he said.</p>
