      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>A Princeton, N.J., biotechnology company, Medarex, said it had begun clinical trials of a drug to treat prostate cancer only 12 months after identifying the target in the body on which the drug will act. It usually takes several years to formulate a drug and test it on animals before starting trials in people. Medarex's unusual speed stems from its use of genetically altered mice that can produce human antibodies in as little as two to three months. The antibody, which then is tested in animals, is used as the drug. Shares of Medarex rose $5.94, to $88.31.</p>
