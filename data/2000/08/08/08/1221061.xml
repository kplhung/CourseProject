        <p>Finance Minister Xiang Haicheng of China said the government was committed to sell much of its stake in companies listed on the country's two stock exchanges. The money raised would be used to finance social security, he was quoted as saying in China Business Weekly. On average, the government owns about 70 percent of the shares in China's listed companies. Mr. Xiang said the state would initially cut its ownership to 51 percent, and later to 30 percent -- effectively privatizing much of the economy. The share sales could bring the state as much as $27 billion, he said. But Mr. Xiang gave no timetable for the politically charged plan, which has been talked about for years without action.</p>
