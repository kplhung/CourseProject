        <p>Dominion Resources said yesterday that it was buying two nuclear reactors at Millstone Point, near New London, Conn., for $1.3 billion, from Northeast Utilities. The buyers said the price was a record.</p>
        <p>One reason for the high price, about $600 a kilowatt, is that all of the power sale contracts for the plants are to expire soon, leaving the buyers free to sell to whomever they choose at a time when tight capacity promises to make the market for electricity stronger.</p>
        <p>Millstone 3 was among the last and the most expensive nuclear power plants completed in the United States, and the three-unit Millstone complex -- named for the mill stones that were once quarried at the site, in Waterford -- also has one of the most checkered operating histories. But Dominion officials said they were confident that with their experience in operating reactors, they would turn the two operable plants into reliable, low-cost producers.</p>
        <p>Dominion, which is based in Richmond, Va., had unsuccessfully sought to buy the New York Power Authority's two reactors, Indian Point 3 and Fitzpatrick, last year. Northeast, which serves most of Connecticut and parts of Massachusetts and New Hampshire, is being acquired by the Consolidated Edison Company of New York.</p>
        <p>But the reactors are orphans. When Con Ed made its offer, in October 1999, it said it would pay $25 a share for Northeast including Millstone but $26 a share without the reactors, thus giving them negative value.</p>
        <p>The sale was conducted at the behest of state regulators, in an auction conducted by J. P. Morgan. Dominion officials said they did not know who the other bidders were.</p>
        <p>Dominion said it hoped to close the deal next April. The company is buying all of Millstone 2 and 93.47 percent of Millstone 3; two minority owners are retaining their stake. Millstone 1, which is adjacent, was shut in 1995 because of operating problems and is being decommissioned.</p>
        <p>In fact, all three plants were closed in 1995 and 1996 because of safety concerns in a case that shook up both the utility and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Operators at Unit 3 had routinely flouted rules on waiting for fuel to cool before moving it during refueling shutdowns.</p>
        <p>Unit 3 was closed from 1996 until 1998, and Unit 2 from 1996 until 1999. Dominion, which runs four reactors that it built in Virginia, was hired by Northeast to assist in reopening them and worked at the site for two and a half years.</p>
        <p>Thomas F. Farrell II, the chief executive of Dominon's power generation subsidiary, said in a telephone interview: ''Some people don't feel comfortable with nuclear, I guess. We've had it for a long time, and we're very very good at it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Farrell and James P. O'Hanlon, the president and chief operating officer of Dominion's generation subsidiary, said the company was eager to enter the competitive electric market in the Northeast and might sell directly to residential, commercial and industrial consumers.</p>
        <p>''We're a very low-cost producer through our Virginia Power subsidiary, and I hope you will see similar performance in Connecticut,'' Mr. Farrell said.</p>
        <p>Northeast has about 1,800 employees at the Millstone complex but plans to pare that number to 1,625 by the end of the year and has said it will reduce it further later on. Dominion said it would offer job and wage guarantees for one year after the deal closes.</p>
        <p>Approval of the sale is required from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and various state agencies.</p>
