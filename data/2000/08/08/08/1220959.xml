        <p>A Brief History</p>
        <p>In his 16-year career, Atom Egoyan has made decidedly controlled films, often on the theme of people's desire for control. This Armenian-Canadian director has also succeeded in making his personal concerns -- the price of ethnic assimilation and the impact of technology on memory and sexuality -- resonate with the larger world. Beginning tomorrow, Mr. Egoyan's expanding scope will be the basis for a retrospective at Anthology Film Archives, 32-34 Second Avenue, at Second Street in the East Village. The five-day series traverses films ranging from his 1984 debut, ''Next of Kin,'' which explores his Armenian roots, to his 1997 adaptation of the Russell Banks novel ''The Sweet Hereafter.'' Information: (212) 505-5181.</p>

        <p>Time Travel</p>
        <p>Where: The trees and rooftops of the picturesque courtyard at the Pulse Ensemble Theater, 432 West 42nd Street in Clinton. When: That depends. In its second Outdoor Shakespeare Series, the company is out to prove that true classics transcend time. In a new production of ''Macbeth,'' those notorious witches wreak havoc all the way from 16th-century England to the present. The ethereal comedy of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' lands squarely in the boisterous Roaring Twenties. ''Macbeth'' begins previews tomorrow and ''Midsummer'' on Aug. 16; the plays run in repertory through Sept. 17. Information: (212) 279-4200.</p>
        <p>Glimpsing the Future</p>
        <p>Vaunting its reputation as a training ground, the Caramoor International Music Festival ends this week with a reunion of sorts. In ''Bringin' It All Back Home,'' three concerts are a showcase for the Caramoor Virtuosi, many of whom took part in Caramoor's Rising Stars workshops, recital series and festival programs and who are now making their names in concert halls around the world. The festival finale on Saturday merges old and new in Bach's Concerto in D for Three Violins and Orchestra; Mozart's Piano Concerto in A, with Leon Fleisher at the keyboard, and Bartok's String Quartet, No. 1, in the premiere of a new transcription for orchestra by the evening's conductor, Peter Oundjian. Information: (914) 232-1252.</p>
        <p>Never the Same</p>
        <p>Roger C. Jeffrey, a former Tharp ensemble member, and Subtle Changes will return to  Lincoln Center Out of Doors on Wednesday to do what they do best: evolve. Since its founding in 1997, this arts collective has lived up to its name, shifting its focus from year to year. ''Speaking in Truth,'' this summer's offering, features dances by African-American female choreographers, including Hope Boykin, Ayodele Casel, Kerri Edge, Cheryl Godineaux, Jamie Philbert and Laila Sales, to be performed by a company of 25 performers and set to music by Bill Withers, Bobby McFerrin and Mobb Deep. Information: (212) 875-5108.</p>
