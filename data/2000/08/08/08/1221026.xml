        <p>The New York City Board of Education is planning to provide online training for the city's 78,000 teachers starting next fall, Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy issued a request for proposals from private companies to help the board create a Web site that would provide the course work. Teachers would be able to access the site 24 hours a day, making it a more convenient option for professional development than courses offered by local colleges or the United Federation of Teachers.</p>
        <p>The online training would not replace those courses, Mr. Levy said, adding that the union supported the plan. Senior teachers, who teach many of the union-sponsored courses, would help develop the curriculum for the Web site, he said.</p>
        <p>''It could leverage our existing professional development capacity -- these very excellent senior teachers -- to a much broader audience,'' Mr. Levy said.</p>
        <p>The chancellor could not provide specifics yesterday about how the online training would work or how much it would cost the school system. But he said it would most likely be used by teachers seeking credits toward advanced degrees, or those who are struggling and need to sharpen their skills. Mr. Levy said it was not intended for unlicensed teachers who are seeking certification.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy insisted that the online courses would not merely be an easy way for teachers to earn credits -- and with them, a higher salary -- because the course work would pose questions that would have to be answered thoughtfully.</p>
        <p>''It's not as though they're being asked to answer A, B, C or D,'' he said. ''It's rather that they're being asked, 'Here's a classroom situation and how would you handle it?' Since they actually have to type in an answer, it makes it a little difficult to do it with the back of your hand.''</p>
        <p>The training would include interactive exercises similar to those that flight simulators offer pilots, he said.</p>
        <p>''It allows teachers to, in effect, see a classroom situation, see people interact and propose alternative ways to respond,'' Mr. Levy said. ''The machine will then make suggestions about how it could be improved. This is a different kind of approach to professional development.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy said that ideally the board would be able to sell its online training program to other school districts and reap a profit, which it would share with whichever private company helps develop the site. A request for proposals was sent to 70 companies, including Apple Computer, International Business Machines, Microsoft, Hydrogen Media in St. Petersburg, Fla., and Learning Edge in Tappan, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy said the online training might be especially useful for teachers whose supervisors had given them a poor evaluation. ''In some ways the anonymity of the machine might make it more inviting to teachers who might not otherwise want to own up to their frailties,'' he said.</p>
