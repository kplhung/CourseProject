        <p>When children have seizures, doctors are sometimes put in quandaries: should they assume the seizure is epilepsy and begin medicating? Or should they wait and hope it is just an isolated occurrence?</p>
        <p>A new study may shed some light on the best course. In the current Annals of Neurology, researchers say they have found that when a child has seizures more than once, the diagnosis probably is epilepsy.</p>
        <p>Seventy percent of children who have a second seizure go on to have more. Knowing this may help doctors decide whether long-term medication, despite the potential for side effects, may be appropriate, the study said. The report was prepared by researchers from the Montefiore Medical Center and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.</p>
        <p>Previous studies, the researchers said, have shown that a single seizure -- or a set of them over 24 hours -- does not necessarily mean a child has epilepsy. About a third go on to have second seizures, the study said.</p>
        <p>The new findings were based on a study of 407 children under 16 after their first seizures.</p>
        <p>The researchers found that the children at the highest risk for continued seizures were those whose first two convulsions occurred within six months of each other. Also at risk where those with neurological conditions like cerebral palsy.</p>
