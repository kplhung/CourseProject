        <p>Researchers who analyzed thousands of car crashes report that many parents are not using child car seats and booster seats correctly and that proper protection drops sharply for children 3 to 8 years old.</p>
        <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics and government safety experts recommend that babies up to 20 pounds travel in rear-facing car seats; toddlers 20 to 40 pounds, generally those 1 to 4 years old, in forward-facing car seats; and children between 40 and 80 pounds, generally 4 to 8 years, in booster seats that make adult seat belts fit well across children's hips, chests and shoulders.</p>

        <p>Researchers who analyzed thousands of car crashes report that many parents are not using child car seats and booster seats correctly and that proper protection drops sharply for children 3 to 8 years old.</p>
        <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics and government safety experts recommend that babies up to 20 pounds travel in rear-facing car seats; toddlers 20 to 40 pounds, generally those 1 to 4 years old, in forward-facing car seats; and children between 40 and 80 pounds, generally 4 to 8 years, in booster seats that make adult seat belts fit well across children's hips, chests and shoulders.</p>
        <p>For the new analysis, researchers at Children's Hospital in Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania examined State Farm Insurance data on 30,000 crashes involving 48,000 children.</p>
        <p>The study found that 30 percent of babies below the age of 1 who should have been traveling in rear-facing car seats were turned forward. While most parents used car seats properly for children up to age 2, fewer than half the 3-year-olds were given the proper protection, with nearly a third being graduated to booster seats before they reached the recommended 40-pound threshold.</p>
        <p>The most striking safety lapse was for children 4 to 8: 83 percent were inappropriately put in adult seats instead of the recommended belt-positioning booster seats.</p>
        <p>''We want to stress that child-specific restraint does not end at age 2,'' said Dr. Flaura Koplin Winston, a pediatrics professor at Children's Hospital and a principal researcher in the study.</p>
        <p>Even when parents were using car seats or booster seats, they often made other errors, like failing to attach the seat tightly enough or misusing the chest clip. In addition, 16 percent of children 12 and under were allowed to ride in the front seat, increasing their risk of injury from a crash or air bag.</p>
        <p>The study found serious consequences from lack of proper restraints. In crashes studied, 64 percent of injuries were head-related.</p>
        <p>''For the 2- to 5-year-olds, there is a fourfold decrease of serious head injuries when those children are in car seats or booster seats rather than inappropriately in adult seat belts,'' Dr. Winston said.</p>
        <p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration advises a quick test on the car seat after its installation by firmly pulling the base of the child seat forward and from the sides. A properly installed car seat should not move more than one inch in any direction.</p>
        <p>As for booster seats, Dr. Winston recommends belt-positioning boosters that make the seat belts fit over children's hips, chests and shoulders, rather than shield boosters, which use only lap belts and could lead to ejection in a crash.</p>
        <p>In addition, manufacturers offer these suggestions: do not use strap covers, blankets or cushions under harness straps because they may interfere with proper fit; secure car seats with lap belts that will not change lengths while driving; adults should not hold children in their arms or share the same seat belt (a 20-pound child in a car can put an extra force of 400 pounds on the adult's arms during a crash at 30 miles an hour), and do not allow children to hold lollipops or ice cream on a stick while riding.</p>
