        <p>Correction of August 6 Market Watch column on plans by James H Clark, founder of Netscape and co-founder of Healtheon/WebMD, to buy stock in Healtheon</p>
      </abstract>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The Market Watch column in Money &amp; Business on Sunday about plans by James H. Clark, the founder of Netscape and co-founder of Healtheon/WebMD, to buy stock in Healtheon, referred incompletely to regulations on stock purchases by insiders. While a Securities and Exchange Commission spokesman indeed said there were no prohibitions, that comment applied only to the context of Mr. Clark's plan. Insiders may not buy stock based on possession of material nonpublic information. But trading on the basis of insider information was not an issue in the column.</p>
