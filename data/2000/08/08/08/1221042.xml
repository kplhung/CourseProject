        <p>Ruling by Arbitrator Splits Arthur Andersen in Two  An international arbitrator ruled that the world's largest consulting firm could separate from the the world's largest accounting firm.</p>
        <p>The ruling frees Andersen Consulting, with 65,000 employees, from its parent company, which now consists entirely of Arthur Andersen, a tax and auditing firm with 77,000 employees. In exchange, Andersen Consulting will have to give up its name and pay Arthur Andersen $1 billion. Analysts called the decision, coming at the end of a three-year battle, a major victory for the consultants. [Page A1.]</p>
        <p>Bear Stearns Settles a Lawsuit  Bear Stearns, the sixth-biggest United States securities firm, paid $30 million to settle a lawsuit over its role as an adviser on an ill-fated takeover, said lawyers involved in the case. The case sent tremors through Wall Street two years ago when a federal jury in California found the firm was negligent in the way it advised its client, Daisy Systems, on a 1989 purchase of Cadnetix, and awarded $108 million in damages to shareholders. The judge later reduced the award to $36 million. [C2.]</p>

In the report, the correspondent John Stossel said that research commissioned by ABC showed that conventional produce does not necessarily have more pesticide residue than organic produce. [C11.]</p>

        <p>Earnings Fall at British Airways  British Airways reported a 65 percent plunge in quarterly earnings, attributing the poor performance to the effects of the strong British pound and the rising price of jet fuel.
