        <p>A leading maker of chips that allow digital communications to flow faster, Broadcom, said yesterday that it had agreed to acquire Silicon Spice, a privately held company, in a stock swap valued at $1.19 billion. Silicon Spice is developing chip technology and software to make it easier to move high-density voice and data from traditional telephone networks to the Internet by companies like Cisco Systems, which is an investor and a customer. Silicon Spice is the 12th and most expensive acquisition since June 1999 for Broadcom, which is based in Irvine, Calif. Last week it agreed to buy Altima Communications for about $595 million in stock to gain greater access to small and medium-sized businesses.</p>
