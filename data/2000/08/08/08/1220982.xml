        <p>Henry G. Cisneros, the former housing secretary in the Clinton administration who became the president and chief operating officer of the largest Spanish-language television broadcaster in the United States, announced yesterday that he was leaving the company, Univision Communications Inc., to run a concern that will build affordable housing in downtown urban areas.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cisneros, who is returning to his hometown of San Antonio, where he served as mayor from 1981 to 1989, will become a partner with one of the nation's largest home builders, the Kaufman &amp; Broad Home Corporation, for his new venture. Mr. Cisneros said in a telephone interview that his company, American CityVista, would identify areas that had been overlooked by major home builders -- but are centrally located -- to build residential communities, or ''villages within cities,'' at affordable market prices.</p>
        <p>The announcement was welcomed by Texas Democrats, who have fallen on such hard times they currently hold no statewide office. The possibility that Mr. Cisneros would run for office again, perhaps governor, is tantalizing in the eyes of those who say his star power remains strong in Texas despite the scandal involving payments to his former mistress  that drove him out of national politics. Last September, Mr. Cisneros pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count of lying to the F.B.I. about the payments and was fined $10,000.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cisneros has denied any desire to run for public office again. At 53,  he said, he had been looking instead for ''an entrepreneurial opportunity'' that would satisfy both his public service and business inclinations.</p>
        <p>''This represents a melding of mission and business,'' he said. ''Providing housing for people is as close to public service as you can get.''</p>
        <p>Still, political experts said, Mr. Cisneros could help lift his party considerably by using his charisma and fund-raising abilities to help elect Democrats in 2002, when the statewide offices will be on the ballot.</p>
        <p>As Univision's president and chief operating officer since 1997, Mr. Cisneros focused on selling the broadcaster to leading advertisers. The company, which has experienced tremendous growth in both advertising and revenue as the rapidly growing Hispanic population expands its viewership, reaches more than 90 percent of the Hispanic television audience in the United States through 33 broadcast and 1,093 cable affiliates.</p>
        <p>Analysts who follow the publicly traded company said Mr. Cisneros had played a critical role in attracting multinational advertisers. But they said that Univision had a good management team and that the departure of Mr. Cisneros should not affect the company's operations or growth in the long run.</p>
        <p>After the resignation announcement, Univision stock was down $4.31, or 3.5 percent, to $117.56; Kaufman &amp; Broad Home's shares rose $2.62, or 13 percent, to $22.75.</p>
        <p>Univision's chairman and chief executive is A. Jerrold Perenchio, a Hollywood deal maker and major Republican Party donor who led the group of investors that bought the network from Hallmark Cards in 1992.</p>
        <p>Mr. Perenchio, who has assumed Mr. Cisneros' responsibilities, said in a written statement that Mr. Cisneros' ''efforts on behalf of Univision were instrumental in our development and he will certainly be missed.''</p>
