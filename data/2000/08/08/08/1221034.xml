      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial on surge in electricity prices says main underlying cause is deregulation of power industry in New York and other states; says state needs to encourage building of new power plants to meet rising demand, and Con Edison should find ways to expand transmission capability; says bill on Gov George Pataki's desk that blocks Con Ed from requiring its own customers to pay for shutdown at its Indian Point plant would give more relief to ratepayers than alternative proposal from Con Ed to deal with Indian Point problems</p>

        <p>Many New Yorkers stared at their electric bills this month in confusion and disbelief. The cost of electricity distributed by Consolidated Edison in June went up about 40 percent over last year. July's bills are expected to be 30 percent higher than a year ago -- all despite a summer so temperate that even fans cooled lazily on their lowest speed.</p>
        <p>The reasons for this sudden spike in electric costs include not only higher fuel prices but also dramatic increases in the use of electricity because of the booming economy and no comparable increase in the amount of power being produced. But the main underlying cause is the deregulation of the power industry in New York and many other states in the last few years. Over the long haul, deregulation is supposed to usher in lower prices by giving consumers the chance to shop around for their energy supply the way they shop around for their telephone service. But while deregulation was being debated in state legislatures across the country, power companies, uncertain of what a deregulated market would look like, held back on building new power plants.</p>

        <p>Many New Yorkers stared at their electric bills this month in confusion and disbelief. The cost of electricity distributed by Consolidated Edison in June went up about 40 percent over last year. July's bills are expected to be 30 percent higher than a year ago -- all despite a summer so temperate that even fans cooled lazily on their lowest speed.</p>
        <p>The reasons for this sudden spike in electric costs include not only higher fuel prices but also dramatic increases in the use of electricity because of the booming economy and no comparable increase in the amount of power being produced. But the main underlying cause is the deregulation of the power industry in New York and many other states in the last few years. Over the long haul, deregulation is supposed to usher in lower prices by giving consumers the chance to shop around for their energy supply the way they shop around for their telephone service. But while deregulation was being debated in state legislatures across the country, power companies, uncertain of what a deregulated market would look like, held back on building new power plants.</p>
        <p>Thus occurred a shortfall in reserves just when demand was rising. In the short term, there may not be a lot that New York can do about this. But in the medium and long term, if energy prices are going to drop the way deregulation proponents promised, the state's task is clear. It needs to encourage the building of new, efficient and environmentally sound power plants. Meanwhile, Con Ed should also find ways to expand transmission lines, especially in New York City and Long Island, to help bring in electricity from outside the region.</p>
        <p>There is some suspicion that New York's problems have been aggravated by policies specific to Con Edison, which is still the primary distributor of power in the New York metropolitan region. Con Ed officials have repeatedly said that the cost of their distribution has not gone up, only the cost of electricity that they now buy and pass along to consumers. Still, Senator Charles Schumer and the New York State Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, have begun asking important questions about whether the Public Service Commission does enough to encourage lower prices at every stage in the process.</p>
        <p>These and other critics also argue that the  Public Service Commission should move quickly to give consumers a fair share of the money Con Ed received from the sale of its many power plants under deregulation -- one way to cut future costs to consumers. In addition, there is a bill on Gov.  George Pataki's desk that blocks Con Ed from requiring its own customers to pay more than $600,000 a day for additional electricity to replace that lost by a shutdown at its Indian Point plant since February. Signing this bill would give more relief to ratepayers than an alternative proposal from Con Ed to deal with the Indian Point problems.</p>
        <p>New York is not the only area struggling with difficult energy questions this summer. Deregulation has caused upheaval around the country, and each state has come up with a different recipe for transition into a freer energy market. California, where few new power plants are coming on line and demand is rapidly outstripping supply, has already warned consumers of the possibility of rolling blackouts this summer. With a nasty heat wave, New York could find itself in much the same fix.</p>
