        <p>After years of serving others, many older Roman Catholic nuns look forward to a few comforts of their own when they retire to their convents. Instead, they often find themselves with aches and pains from the heavy doors, long hallways and endless steps to the chapel.</p>
        <p>''As our numbers diminish, these places have become too large and outmoded,'' said Sister Mary Paschal Hill, 59, a member of the Sisters of Mercy in Hartsdale, a suburb north of New York City. ''It is very hard for our aging members. If you have to walk a half-mile to the dining room and the chapel, it really becomes a chore.''</p>

        <p>After years of serving others, many older Roman Catholic nuns look forward to a few comforts of their own when they retire to their convents. Instead, they often find themselves with aches and pains from the heavy doors, long hallways and endless steps to the chapel.</p>
        <p>''As our numbers diminish, these places have become too large and outmoded,'' said Sister Mary Paschal Hill, 59, a member of the Sisters of Mercy in Hartsdale, a suburb north of New York City. ''It is very hard for our aging members. If you have to walk a half-mile to the dining room and the chapel, it really becomes a chore.''</p>
        <p>So rather than suffer silently, the Sisters of Mercy and four other religious orders in Westchester and Rockland Counties are building a retirement center solely for their nuns. The $11.5 million center, which is expected to open here this fall, will house 50 older women amid such modern-day comforts as private bedrooms and bathrooms, computers, two elevators, even a beauty parlor. ''When did you ever have that many women and not need a beautician?'' chided Sister Paschal when asked about that last amenity.</p>
        <p>The retirement center has brought together a diverse group of supporters ranging from the author Mary Higgins Clark, who is chairwoman of its fund-raising campaign, to former parochial school students once taught by the nuns. In addition, the center has attracted national attention as a model solution to what many see as a growing problem in the Catholic Church: the rapidly aging population of nuns and male members of religious orders who have devoted their lives to the church without benefit of retirement plans and pension funds and now require costly care.</p>
        <p>''We're dealing with all these people now,'' said Sister Andree Fries, executive director of the church's National Religious Retirement Office in Washington. ''Our priority has been in serving the poor, so you don't have a lot of savings. Building up for retirement has never been a priority for us, and now it's hitting us in the face.''</p>
        <p>As the median age of nuns has crept up to 68, religious orders have  scrambled to provide for them. Most nuns take a vow of poverty and do not own their own homes or keep any personal savings. Their government benefits are limited, too, because they usually earn modest salaries at Catholic schools, hospitals and parishes. The average Social Security benefit for a member of a Catholic religious order was $3,333 last year compared with $9,650 for the average citizen.</p>
        <p>Although these religious orders serve the Catholic Church, they have traditionally functioned as distinct, autonomous groups with their own missions, assets and incomes. But in recent years they have increasingly shared resources to survive at a time when fewer young people are entering religious life. Church records show that the number of nuns and male religious members has dwindled nationwide from 212,231 in 1967 to 102,362 last year.</p>
        <p>The retirement center for nuns -- named Marian Woods in honor of the Virgin Mary -- grew out of five years of meetings and prayers by religious orders that have about 750 nuns altogether. In addition to the Sisters of Mercy, the others are the Franciscan Sisters of Peace in Haverstraw, the Sisters of Saint Dominic in Blauvelt, the Society of the Holy Child Jesus in Rye and the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament in Scarsdale.</p>
        <p>''So often, we've said, no one congregation could have done this by themselves,'' said Sister Margaret Gaffikin, 53, a member of the Franciscan Sisters.</p>
        <p>The religious orders used their savings last year to buy 11 acres of grassy fields and woods from the  Archdiocese of New York for $600,000 and to secure loans for the building construction. The site is part of a 132-acre estate off Ridge Road that was originally owned by Henry Gaisman, inventor of the safety razor, and later bought by the archdiocese. The remaining estate was sold to New York State, Westchester County and the Town of Greenburgh for $8 million to preserve as a park.</p>
        <p>Joseph Zwilling, a spokesman for the archdiocese, said that church leaders offered the property at well below its market value to support the nuns' efforts. The archdiocese also donates $1 million annually to a collection by the National Religious Retirement Office. That collection, which raised $31.4 million last year, has been used in part to pay for a $25,000 grant this year to Marian Woods and an additional $188,855 in grants to the five orders to care for their older members.</p>
        <p>The fund-raising campaign headed by Ms. Clark has also gained support in the community. Two hundred people attended a cocktail reception and auction at the new site in May and donated about $14,000. The Ladies of Charity of the Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York, a nonprofit group with more than 1,000 members, has pledged $1 million of the $3.1 million raised so far in donations. ''Most of us were educated in the Catholic schools,'' said Dorothea McElduff, the group's treasurer. ''Now these ladies are older and not well. They need help and they don't ask.''</p>
        <p>For many nuns, this outpouring of money and affection has been gratifying. ''I think it shows that the laity really appreciates what the sisters have done through the years,'' said Sister Mary Alfred Temple, 69, a member of the Sisters of Mercy.</p>
        <p>Sister Alfred said that living at the  center would allow her to maintain her independence even though she suffers every day from arthritis. She will have her own room in the brick-and-glass building and be able to worship in its specially designed, single-level chapel with no steps. ''That's a blessing,'' she said. ''It's wonderful not to have to think about stairs at all.''</p>
