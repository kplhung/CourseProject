        <p>Citigroup in New York said yesterday that it had chosen Fallon Minneapolis, part of the Fallon Worldwide unit of Publicis Groupe S.A., as the agency of record to handle the Citibank consumer business in the United States, including retail banking and credit cards.</p>
        <p>Billings were estimated at more than $120 million.</p>
        <p>The decision came after a four-month review that had been narrowed to Fallon and offices of TBWA/Chiat/Day, part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group.</p>
        <p>Since August 1997, the global Citibank account had been consolidated at Young &amp; Rubicam Advertising in New York.</p>
        <p>Y.&amp; R., which was one of six agencies that took part in the review, continues to handle Citibank consumer advertising in Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Middle East. Direct marketing will continue to be handled by the Impiric unit of Y.&amp; R.</p>
