        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The plan for affordable housing presented at a recent New York City Hall news conference (news article, Aug. 3) should form the basis for a larger, urgently needed plan.</p>
        <p>Recent census data show that 25 percent of New York renters pay more than half of their income for rent, and that there is a shortage of close to 400,000 affordable apartments for the city's poorest renters. And in June, the number of homeless people in shelters exceeded 24,000 for the first time since 1996 and included more than 10,000 children.</p>

        <p>The plan for affordable housing presented at a recent New York City Hall news conference (news article, Aug. 3) should form the basis for a larger, urgently needed plan.</p>
        <p>Recent census data show that 25 percent of New York renters pay more than half of their income for rent, and that there is a shortage of close to 400,000 affordable apartments for the city's poorest renters. And in June, the number of homeless people in shelters exceeded 24,000 for the first time since 1996 and included more than 10,000 children.</p>
        <p>A recent Coalition for the Homeless report outlines the challenge facing New York City: rising population, declining housing production and a widening affordability gap.</p>
        <p>A multiyear capital commitment of $750 million a year is needed to develop new housing for low-  and middle-income New Yorkers. In a time of economic prosperity, nothing less will reverse the growing shortage of affordable homes for all New Yorkers.</p>
        <p>PATRICK MARKEE  New York, Aug. 4, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is senior policy analyst, Coalition for the Homeless.</p>
