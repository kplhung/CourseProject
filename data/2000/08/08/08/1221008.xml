        <p>Charles Schwab, the billionaire businessman who runs one of the world's most successful brokerage firms, is dyslexic. But, he insists, that does not mean he is disabled. ''I look at it as a difference,'' he said.</p>
        <p>At a time when school districts are moving to standardize curriculum and districts are placing a heavier emphasis on state tests, Mr. Schwab is spending the equivalent of hundreds of millions of dollars leading a campaign of Americans who refer to themselves as having ''learning differences'' rather than learning disabilities.</p>
        <p>To some, Mr. Schwab is on a quixotic semantic quest, something like making sure the bald are called ''follically challenged.'' But to others, he is using his name and fortune to undermine a delicate and vital financing structure it has taken years to erect.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schwab said his main purpose was to encourage schools to see all children as distinct learners who need individualized attention.</p>
        <p>''What you're trying to do with all this definitional stuff is to make sure you don't beat the kids down and make them think they're fully defective,'' he said. ''My fundamental belief is that you want to emphasize the kids' strengths.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schwab's initiative makes the Learning Disabilities Association of America, the most powerful advocacy group for the learning disabled, nervous. It is concerned that children with learning disabilities will not get the services they need if they are redefined under the broader term learning differences. What's more, the group is worried that the federal financing for which it has fought for years will decline or even disappear if ''learning differences'' comes into favor with legislators.</p>
        <p>''The danger, and where the controversy comes from, is that there are some parents who would not like to have their child called disabled,'' said Ann Kornblet, executive director of the Learning Disabilities Association of America.</p>
        <p>''The reality is that a true learning disability is a handicapping condition. Without understanding that, you're not prepared to help them prepare for a life of advocating for themselves.''</p>
        <p>The Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act of 1975 uses the term ''learning disability'' to classify children with ''a disorder in one or more of the basic psychological processes involved in understanding or in using language, spoken or written.''</p>
        <p>A learning disability may show up as an imperfect ability to listen, think, speak, read, write, spell or do mathematical calculations, according to the federal definition. Education officials say that 12 percent of all school-age children are now classified as learning disabled.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schwab is not alone in his opposition to the term. An increasing number of parents seem to be referring to their learning disabled children as learning different and teachers are starting to use the term in the classroom.</p>
        <p>He and his wife founded the Charles and Helen Schwab Foundation, now called the Schwab Foundation for Learning, in 1988 to address the needs of such families.</p>
        <p>Along with his own foundation, he is the co-chairman of All Kinds of Minds, an iconoclastic organization that looks at every child -- disabled or not -- in terms of strengths and weaknesses.</p>
        <p>''Our model is one where we refuse to label anybody, so we have no 'learning disabilities,' '' said Mel Levine, co-chairman of the organization with Mr. Schwab.</p>
        <p>The group has already trained 5,000 teachers around the country to speak the language of learning differences at several regional training centers, including one program run by The Bank Street College of Education in Manhattan. Plans are in the works to open a chain of consultation centers where parents can take their children to be evaluated.</p>
        <p>Eventually, Dr. Levine hopes that every school in the country will follow his model.</p>
        <p>''We are determined to start a national movement,'' he said. ''As of now, we're swimming upstream in many respects because people love to label kids, people love to medicate kids and people love to test kids.''</p>
        <p>Some of the strongest voices in the learning-disabled community -- which includes researchers, lawyers and the advocacy group -- say the term disabled may have a negative connotation to some but is still the most accurate. They worry that Mr. Schwab's opposition to the term could unravel an identity it has taken years to weave.</p>
        <p>''We're stuck with the term partly because we need to because of advocacy and partly because it's true,'' said Larry Silver, president of the disabilities association.</p>
        <p>''You empower your kids by helping them understand themselves: 'learning differences' suggest that you're just like everyone else, except if they add with their fingers, you add with your toes.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schwab's pronouncements bear a special weight in the learning-disabled community, because he is its largest benefactor.</p>
        <p>To date, he has endowed what amounts to $280 million in Schwab stock to the groups that use the term learning difference.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schwab said that he first discovered his dyslexia as an adult, when listening to a psychologist explain why his 8-year-old son was having problems reading. As he sat in the office, Mr. Schwab said, he realized that many of his own problems with language had the same cause.</p>
        <p>''You need a few people to step out and say there is an issue, there's a stigma,'' Mr. Schwab said.</p>
        <p>''I need to say, 'I've dealt with it and it's not going to be the worst thing in the world.' ''</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 12, 2000, Saturday  An article on Tuesday about efforts by the financier Charles Schwab to champion the term ''learning difference'' over ''learning disability'' referred incorrectly to his actions and those of his Schwab Foundation for Learning. While Mr. Schwab has pledged substantial financial support to an organization that uses the term ''learning difference,'' he is not spending the equivalent of hundreds of millions of dollars on such a campaign. His foundation, with an endowment of $280 million, embraces both terms.</p>
