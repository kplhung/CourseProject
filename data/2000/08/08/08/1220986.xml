        <p>CORPORATIONS beware: if you were born before 1865, Deadria C. Farmer-Paellmann is looking for slaves in your archives and may have bad news for you.</p>
        <p>The sleuthing started in 1992 when, as artistic director of the protest (a 26-hour ''drum vigil'') that halted excavation of a 17th-century African burial ground near City Hall, Ms. Farmer-Paellmann got insider privileges to crunch a hard hat over her dreadlocks and crash the site. There she stumbled on a scene that changed --and channeled -- her life's work.</p>
        <p>On property the government planned to convert to a parking lot were the skeletons of some of her ancestors, the 20,000 slaves who helped build the city where she grew up poor on public assistance but now lives comfortably -- no apologies -- in a Second Avenue duplex with doormen at her beck and call. After all, she's nine months' pregnant.</p>
        <p>But back to the past and the deceased slaves for whom Ms. Farmer-Paellmann, 34, is a legal advocate.</p>
        <p>Some skeletons were intact, many skulls bore tribal markings, and the way she remembers it, all wore the same expression: ''They looked like they were screaming.'' Her shock subsided only slightly when assured by an archaeologist that decomposition caused the grimaces.</p>
        <p>But first impressions don't lie, and she tends to trust hers. That's how she wound up married to a white German who works in corporate finance. For someone whose Afro-centric commitment extends to her hairdo -- dreadlocks since 1990 -- that might count as three strikes against him.</p>
        <p>''I was concerned there might be a perception I didn't think black guys were good enough, but what was I supposed to do, pass him up because he wasn't black?'' she explains. ''I looked beyond race,'' she adds, sounding defensive. ''Plus, he treats me like a queen.'' Plus, he supports the mission she adopted after seeing the skeletons: pressing the case of the dead slaves of America versus the corporations that turned a profit exploiting them.</p>
        <p>''They lived, worked and died in this city, and they never got their reparations -- it moved me,'' says Ms. Farmer-Paellmann, whose search for ''tainted corporations'' in the Northeast has turned up a dozen offenders. First, she wants the companies to apologize. Second, using a tactic that echoes the German Parliament's endorsement of a corporate-financed reparation fund for World War II slave laborers, she wants part of their profits assigned to a trust fund.</p>
        <p>If she's a little fuzzy on how this fund will be dispersed, not to worry: so far, no one has contributed. It's been rough just extracting apologies. But thanks to a pending alliance with two law firms, she anticipates that her targets will soon pay her more attention. And pay up.</p>
        <p>In February, in conjunction with Black History Month, Ms. Farmer-Paellmann, a 1999 graduate of the New England School of Law, began her offensive: she castigated Aetna, the insurance giant, for having written policies on slaves with the owners as beneficiaries. She also charged that the FleetBoston Financial Corporation had ties to slavery, including loans to John Brown, the Rhode Island slave trader whose family helped to found Brown University.</p>
        <p>AETNA apologized publicly in March, and The Hartford Courant, confessing to slave advertisements in its classifieds, did the same last month. She says that Fleet declined to deal with her.</p>
        <p>In the ensuing spurt of coverage, a Canadian newspaper called her ''a moral extortionist.'' Is she?</p>
        <p>''No one calls the Jewish Holocaust survivors and their descendants moral extortionists,'' she fumes. ''I know this is justice. People say we waited too long, but these guys were on it a hundred years ago, the ex-slaves themselves,'' she asserts, waving a copy of a reparations bill the Senate vetoed in 1898. ''The government crushed it. It's tragic.''</p>
        <p>When her grandfather's grandparents, Clara and Able Hinds, ran away from the rice plantation on St. Helena Island, S.C., where they were enslaved, they did not live happily ever after.</p>
        <p>When Ms. Farmer-Paellmann moved with her mother and five sisters from East New York, where the Black Panthers ran the summer lunch program for kids but gangs ran the streets, across Brooklyn to Bensonhurst in 1973, they didn't live too happily either. And not just because (with a semi-deadbeat dad in the picture) they relied on welfare.</p>
        <p>''I was 7 years old and I found out that that black people were still called nigger,'' says Ms. Farmer-Paellmann, who also discovered hers was the only black family on the block. ''The day the neighborhood kids got back from summer camp, they saw us in the window, threw a can at us and called us niggers, and I thought, 'Whoa.' Probably not a day went by when I didn't hear it. It seemed like every time the window was repaired, something would get thrown through it again.''</p>
        <p>Back then, Ms. Farmer-Paellmann escaped into music via a piano, a gift from her grandmother. But she hankered, inexplicably, to be a lawyer: ''My father used to say, 'You have an excuse for everything' and I'd say, 'Dad, there's a reason for everything.' ''</p>
        <p>Except slavery.</p>
        <p>''How long are we going to stay asleep on this?'' Ms. Farmer-Paellmann asks. ''I don't mind starting this alone: I'm the wake-up call.''</p>
