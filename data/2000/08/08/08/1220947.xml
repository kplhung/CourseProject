        <p>Students chosen from ballet schools around the nation showed off what they had learned at the American Ballet Theater Summer Intensive program in a performance on Friday afternoon at Pace Downtown Theater.

        <p>One highlight of the 13 numbers was the Dream Sequence from ''Don Quixote,'' danced with impressive authority and technical skill by Karen Uphoff, a dancer of willowy delicacy; by Laura Tant, a stylish firecracker technician; and by Misty Copeland, whose expansiveness communicated the joy of confident young performing.

        <p>Students chosen from ballet schools around the nation showed off what they had learned at the American Ballet Theater Summer Intensive program in a performance on Friday afternoon at Pace Downtown Theater. This year's program had 150 dancers aged 12 to 19, all of whom performed at one time or other in a well-organized program of old and new choreography.</p>
        <p>One highlight of the 13 numbers was the Dream Sequence from ''Don Quixote,'' danced with impressive authority and technical skill by Karen Uphoff, a dancer of willowy delicacy; by Laura Tant, a stylish firecracker technician; and by Misty Copeland, whose expansiveness communicated the joy of confident young performing. In Twyla Tharp's ''Push Comes to Shove,'' a crisp and witty Patricia Delgado appeared to have been born dancing Ms. Tharp's demanding choreography.</p>
        <p>David Hallberg danced with a peculiarly American elegance and classical purity in his third-act solo from ''Raymonda,'' in an excerpt that also included polished dancing from Thomas Baltrushunas, Jared Matthews, Jonnie Tenczar and Sean Whiteman. And throughout the program, McGee Maddox kept stealing the show with performing that was stylish, purposeful and utterly natural.</p>
        <p>Two new works stood out. Daniel Baudendistel brought a pleasantly adult perfume to the stage in his accomplished new ''La Valse,'' turning teenagers into women of the world and their cavaliers. Like Mr. Baudendistel, Karla Wolfangle created choreography that made her young dancers look good as well as allowing them their dignity. Her new ''Landscape,'' danced to music by Scott Marshall, was a slow-moving frieze packed with quiet incident.</p>
        <p>The choreographic pickings were otherwise generally slim in new works by Victorio, Larry Pech, Hillary Cartwright and Roberta Mathes. The program was completed by group dances from ''Coppelia,'' ''Giselle'' and ''The Sleeping Beauty.'' Live accompaniment was provided by the pianists Craig Baldwin and Dmitry Polischuk.</p>
        <p>Rebecca Wright, the genial director of the summer program, announced that Ms. Copeland, Mr. Hallberg, Dartanion Reed, Craig Salstein, Patrick Ogle and Megan Knickerbocker had been chosen for the Ballet Theater junior troupe. The winners of the program's five scholarship awards are Ashley Ellis, Jamie Dee, Jackie Reyes, Lara Baker and Mr. Maddox.</p>
