        <p>By picking Joseph I.

        <p>After striving for more than a year to outrun President Clinton's restless shadow, Vice President Al Gore today made his boldest bid yet for autonomy.</p>
        <p>By picking Joseph I. Lieberman, one of the earliest Democrats to rebuke Mr. Clinton in the Monica Lewinsky affair, Mr. Gore's objective, his advisers and other Democrats say, is to replace his political partner of eight years with a fresh -- and untainted -- candidate who is widely regarded as one of the most upstanding elected officials in the nation.</p>
        <p>Democrats close to Mr. Gore also said he was seeking a No. 2 who could inject a note of vitality into the race and illuminate the Democratic ticket, as polls show that Gov. George W. Bush is on the ascendancy after his triumphant convention in Philadelphia last week.</p>
        <p>At that convention, the Bush campaign left no doubt that it would make the moral lapses of Mr. Clinton a basic subtext of its strategy, emphasizing the need to restore dignity and honor to the White House.</p>
        <p>''It was very clear after Philadelphia that these guys are going to run a campaign of innuendo and guilt by association,'' said Al From, president of the Democratic Leadership Council, a moderate group of which Mr. Lieberman is chairman. ''It's going to be harder for Republicans to sustain that campaign. A Gore-Lieberman ticket is not going to be associated with bad behavior.''</p>
        <p>Yet the very factors that make Mr. Lieberman an enticing choice also make him a vulnerable one.</p>
        <p>In picking the first Jewish running mate -- and one who is Orthodox at that -- Mr. Gore hopes to underscore his willingness to break the political rules and display a dash of daring that has largely been absent from his campaign. But while the choice could energize Jewish voters (though they are overwhelmingly Democratic anyway) it could alienate others who might not be comfortable with a Jew in the White House.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore hopes to protect himself from scandals of Mr. Clinton by tethering himself to a politician who is above reproach, and who has spoken out not only against the president but for campaign finance reform. The downside is that Mr. Lieberman's public denunciations of Mr. Clinton in 1998 could give the Republicans cover to even more forcefully raise questions about the Clinton administration's conduct.</p>
        <p>In turning to a politician with a decidedly moderate voting record who prides himself on not being particularly partisan, Mr. Gore also may have an easier time challenging Mr. Bush for the loyalties of the independent voters he desperately needs to win. But that could also unsettle some faithful Democrats who cringe at Mr. Lieberman's breaks with the Democratic Party -- and Mr. Gore -- on issues including school vouchers and capital gains taxes. Some of these voters could even end up defecting to Ralph Nader, the Green Party nominee, Democratic strategists fear.</p>
        <p>Just as the Gore campaign had tried to tar Mr. Bush by invoking Dick Cheney's conservative voting record, the Bush campaign today sought to use Mr. Lieberman to undermine Mr. Gore's positions. The campaign said Mr. Gore picked a running mate whose ideology is closer to Mr. Bush's than the vice president's.</p>
        <p>''I've been trying to figure out what the Gore people were thinking,'' said Michael Nelson, a political scientist and authority on the vice presidency at Rhodes College in Memphis. ''He's Jewish, but it's not as if the Democrats don't already have them energized. The only thing it brings is criticism of the president -- and I don't see that as an advantage.''</p>
        <p>Republicans acknowledged it was difficult to directly condemn Mr. Lieberman because of his reputation for moral rectitude. William J. Bennett, the conservative morals maven who is close to Mr. Lieberman, said, ''He's arguably the best Democrat in the Senate.'' But asked whether Mr. Lieberman's ramrod reputation would keep Mr. Gore from being linked with Mr. Clinton, he made a point echoed by some Democrats, ''I don't know that Gore becomes a saint because of Lieberman's virtues.''</p>
        <p>Ed Gillespie, an adviser to the Bush campaign, practically validated Mr. Gore's choice by calling Mr. Lieberman ''a decent man and an honorable person.'' But, he added, ''There are just a number of significant issues that Gore has just bitterly attacked Governor Bush on and now he turns around and picks a running mate who agrees with Bush on those issues.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps an even bigger danger for Mr. Gore is that several political consultants said they did not have to think hard to come up with an attack commercial for the Republicans.</p>
        <p>It would open with a clip of Mr. Lieberman shaking his finger like an Old Testament prophet, excoriating Mr. Clinton for ''disgraceful'' and ''immoral'' behavior. The next frame would be a clip of Mr. Gore, celebrating Mr. Clinton as ''one of our greatest presidents.''</p>
        <p>The commercial could end with side-by-side photographs of a scowling Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore and the tag line, ''Even his running mate disagrees with Al Gore over what is appropriate conduct for a president of the United States.''</p>
        <p>However Lieberman is received, this much is clear: it was not a play-it-safe choice, as was Mr. Bush's picking Mr. Cheney. That reflects the political reality that as the convention approaches next week in Los Angeles, Gore advisers said they felt that they had to do something daring -- yet not foolhardy -- to gain ground.</p>
        <p>In choosing Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Gore also showed he was comfortable with a No. 2 who is not known as an especially scintillating speaker on the campaign trail. (It could be, of course, that after being Mr. Clinton's understudy, Mr. Gore did not want someone who would outshine him.)</p>
        <p>And the vice president's choice seemed to reflect his genuine concern about having a No. 2 with the experience and temperament to help him govern. In addition, many people close to Gore have long said that if personal chemistry were the more compelling factor, Mr. Lieberman would shoot to the top of the list.</p>
        <p>For all the calculations of how Mr. Lieberman would help or hurt, the senator, in an interview several weeks ago, dismissed what he -- or anyone -- could bring to the ticket. ''I presume any factor can make enough of a difference,'' he said, ''although not a large difference to be significant.''</p>
        <p>The relevance of a running mate choice, he said, was that it ''may tell the American people something more about the two major candidates.''</p>
        <p>In this case, the choice may tell the public something more not just about Mr. Gore, but about his relationship with his political partner for the past eight years.</p>
