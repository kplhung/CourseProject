        <p>Reuben Zimmerman letter on Aug 1 article on Lasik procedure to correct vision problems; says too many doctors now act only as technicians</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Although very pleased with the result of my own Lasik procedure, done two years ago, I advise friends and patients who ask about the procedure to be careful, and to find a doctor they like and trust (''Laser Eye Surgery's Turf War,'' Aug. 1).</p>
        <p>Too many Lasik surgeons have stopped being doctors and now act only as technicians; they never see the patient (oops, they are now ''clients'') till she is lying in the operating chair, under a fog of Valium-numbed terror.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Although very pleased with the result of my own Lasik procedure, done two years ago, I advise friends and patients who ask about the procedure to be careful, and to find a doctor they like and trust (''Laser Eye Surgery's Turf War,'' Aug. 1).</p>
        <p>Too many Lasik surgeons have stopped being doctors and now act only as technicians; they never see the patient (oops, they are now ''clients'') till she is lying in the operating chair, under a fog of Valium-numbed terror.</p>
        <p>And follow-up, of course, is out of the question: you will see an ''affiliated optometrist'' who will check your eyes at 24 hours, one week and one month. You will not see the surgeon, whether to complain, ask a question or thank him.</p>
        <p>I'm happy with my own eyes, but dismayed that they were treated on the assembly line. Hips and knees, at least, still get fixed by real doctors: people who not only talk but also listen, who acknowledge fear and worry, and who care as much for their patients as they do for their pocketbooks.</p>
