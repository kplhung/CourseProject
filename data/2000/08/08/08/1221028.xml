        <p>Dan Campbell, a Giants rookie tight end last year, changed his uniform number over the winter from 86 to 89. He knew he was going to get more playing time this season, and he figured some fans would notice he was wearing the number of his boyhood idol, Mark Bavaro.</p>
        <p>Today, with Campbell having emerged as the primary replacement for the injured pass-catching tight end Pete Mitchell, the stakes have changed.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to disgrace the number,'' Campbell said before practice today. ''I don't want to make the number look bad. Bavaro was my hero.''</p>
        <p>Campbell, a third-round draft pick last year, is one of three players Coach Jim Fassel plans to use as a substitute for Mitchell's valuable abilities. Mitchell strained his left knee in Saturday's preseason loss to the Bears and will have arthroscopic surgery Tuesday. He may be out six weeks or more.</p>
        <p>Along with Campbell, Fassel said he would use running back Sean Bennett and wide receiver Joe Jurevicius in various tight end duties.</p>
        <p>But Campbell, who is 260 pounds while Bennett and Jurevicius are each 230 pounds, is the only true tight end on the roster. He is the only player who can line up and legitimately be a blocking or pass-receiving threat -- balance and flexibility being the keys to an unpredictable and productive offense.</p>
        <p>Campbell is going to have to show he can catch the ball down the middle or opposing defenses will have their safeties routinely double-teaming the Giants wide receivers. It is no secret that Amani Toomer and Ike Hilliard became the Giants first two 1,000-yard receivers in a single season last year in part because Mitchell was keeping defenses honest with 58 receptions -- most of them in the middle of the field.</p>
        <p>Campbell, who missed today's practice with what the Giants called a minor strain of his left hamstring, understands all this. He would not want it any other way.</p>
        <p>''I don't want them to say, 'Oh, we could do that if Pete were here, but we can't because we've got Dan now,' '' Campbell said. ''That's something I can't live with. I don't want us limiting the offense.''</p>
        <p>Fassel has called Campbell, who is 6 feet 5 inches, a cross between Mitchell, a sly veteran with 224 career receptions, and Howard Cross, the outstanding run-blocking tight end. Campbell gave that analysis his own twist.</p>
        <p>''I'm not great at either,'' he said, meaning pass catching or run blocking. ''But I feel I'm pretty good at both. I'm not going to be Pete Mitchell. I want to be Dan Campbell and do something that hasn't been done around here for a while -- do both, and do them well.''</p>
        <p>Still, there could be some unrefined moments for Campbell since he has little experience as a pass-catching threat. In his senior year at Texas A&amp;M, he had 12 receptions. He did not catch a pass for the Giants last year, mostly aiding the running game and playing on special teams. A hamstring tear in December kept him out of the final four games.</p>
        <p>''Dan doesn't quite have a natural catching ability,'' said the tight ends coach Mike Pope. ''But he'll get an opportunity to learn a lot in the hurry. A lot of it is experience. Guys like Pete Mitchell are used to catching 50 to 60 balls a year. Dan hasn't done that on any level. Until you do it for a little while, you don't expect to see the ball as quick as you come off the line.''</p>
        <p>Beginning with the spring minicamps, the 6-1 Bennett has been working as a backup tight end along with his duties as a valued pass receiver out of the backfield.</p>
        <p>''I already know everything that they'll ask me to do now,'' Bennett said. ''I've studied it. The difference is I've been doing it with the second team.''</p>
        <p>Jurevicius, who is 6-5, could see the least amount of time at tight end, though his work there could be highly conspicuous. In certain crucial third-down and goal-line situations, the Giants have used three or four wide receivers and Mitchell. That is where Jurevicius might fill in.</p>
        <p>But most of all, it is going to be Campbell, who will not be able to hide with that jersey number.</p>
        <p>''They drafted me for some reason,'' Campbell said. ''All the issues of whether I'm ready don't matter. I have to be ready.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Free safety SHAUN WILLIAMS said that his sprained big toe was improving and that he had been told he could return to the Giants in time to play in the team's final preseason game Aug. 25 against Baltimore. Although Williams said that timetable was far from certain, he was no longer using crutches and was encouraged by his progress. . . . MICHAEL STRAHAN returned to practice Monday after missing several sessions with a stiff back. . . . Fullback GREG COMELLA missed practice with a sore back and linebacker MIKE BARROW did not practice to rest a sprained knee he injured last week.</p>
