        <p>Hive Sweet Hive</p>
        <p>Dorothy said it best in ''The Wizard of Oz'': there's no place like home. That's as true for a Kansas farm girl who finds herself in the Emerald City as it is for migrating animals that return to the same place year after year.</p>
        <p>But social insects that migrate are not known to be particularly faithful to their home base. Except, it turns out, the Asian giant honeybee, Apis dorsata.</p>
        <p>People in southern parts of Asia who collect the bees' honey know that the same nest sites -- usually in trees or the eaves of houses -- will be occupied year after year by migrating swarms.</p>
        <p>Now, two reports in the journal Nature show that these nest sites are being occupied by swarms that are related. Researchers in India and Malaysia analyzed the DNA of bees found at the same nesting sites over several years.</p>
        <p>Both groups found that from year to year swarms with the same queen, or with a queen that was the daughter of the previous year's queen, end up at the sites. Since worker bees live for only about two weeks, some sort of genetic mechanism must be at work, the researchers say.</p>
        <p>Unpredictable Comet</p>
        <p>Comet Linear, which made its closest approach to Earth last month, was a bust in more ways than one.</p>
        <p>Although it was one of the brighter comets in years, early predictions that it would be visible to the naked eye did not pan out. The comet, which was discovered in 1999, reached a maximum magnitude of 6 to 6.5, meaning it was not bright enough to be seen without binoculars or a telescope.</p>
        <p>But for professional astronomers, Linear held some surprises. For one thing, jets of gas from the comet caused slight disturbances in its orbit. Astronomers suggested that this was because Linear was probably making its first pass near the Sun. Being fresh, it had lots of ice and other compounds to vaporize as it heated up.</p>
        <p>But the big surprise came around July 26, when the comet made its closest approach to the Sun. Heating of the icy core apparently became so intense that the comet started to disintegrate.</p>
        <p>Breakup of a comet is not unknown -- one notable example being Shoemaker-Levy 9, which broke up before it crashed into Jupiter in 1994. But that breakup left relatively large fragments. Comet Linear, on the other hand, is spewing its mass into space like a puffball in the wind, leaving nothing but dust behind. It is expected to disappear completely.</p>
        <p>Mapping a Protein</p>
        <p>Much has been made, and rightly so, about the project to sequence the human genome and the effect it will have on research into genetics and disease. But the genome, in a way, is really just a blueprint. It is the proteins that it encodes that actually do the work inside the cell. Understanding the nature of those proteins is crucial as well.</p>
        <p>Researchers have taken a big step in that direction, mapping for the first time the crystal structure of a type of protein called a G protein-coupled receptor. These are among the most common proteins encoded by the genome.</p>
        <p>The researchers, from the University of Washington and other institutions, reported in the journal Science that they had mapped the structure of a G.P.C.R. called rhodopsin, which functions in the retina. Rhodopsin is one of the body's links to the outside world, converting light into a signal that is sent to the brain.</p>
        <p>Understanding rhodopsin's structure (which is highly complex, as the molecule contains about 350 amino acids) should help researchers to understand how it interacts with other molecules, which could eventually aid in the design of drugs to combat various eye problems.</p>
        <p>But perhaps more important, since all G.P.C.R.'s have the same basic structure, knowledge of rhodopsin should help in understanding how the others function. And since the proteins play a vital role in so many areas, from the development of the embryo to the beating of the heart, understanding how they function should aid research into a variety of diseases.</p>
