        <p>Paul Griffiths reviews Graham Vick's productions of Mozart's Marriage of Figaro, Don Giovanni and Cosi Fan Tutte at Glyndebourne Festival (M)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Matching productions of Mozart's three mature Italian comedies -- ''The Marriage of Figaro,'' ''Don Giovanni'' and ''Cosi Fan Tutte'' -- at Glyndebourne here this weekend emphasized the works' differences more than their similarities. The director, Graham Vick, and the designer, Richard Hudson, have placed them all in the same wide white space defined by three slender iron pillars, and there is a link, too, in the mix of 18th-century and 20th-century elements in the costumes. This degree of uniformity, though, only points up the productions' contrary purposes.</p>
        <p>The ''Figaro'' is immediate and brilliant. Transparent screens, reassembled for each new act, suggest the life of a great house whose multiple rooms and corridors allow for encounters, assignations and eavesdropping. In this environment, people slide slowly and easily into 18th-century dress, maintaining as they do so a harmony of ivory and gray that gives an effervescent vitality to the few spots of color: Cherubino's blue purloined ribbon, the Count's red heels. Most important, the frank sensuality of Figaro and Susanna is not lost as their clothing becomes more formal: rather it gets shared, in an abundant celebration of love and laughter.</p>

        <p>Matching productions of Mozart's three mature Italian comedies -- ''The Marriage of Figaro,'' ''Don Giovanni'' and ''Cosi Fan Tutte'' -- at Glyndebourne here this weekend emphasized the works' differences more than their similarities. The director, Graham Vick, and the designer, Richard Hudson, have placed them all in the same wide white space defined by three slender iron pillars, and there is a link, too, in the mix of 18th-century and 20th-century elements in the costumes. This degree of uniformity, though, only points up the productions' contrary purposes.</p>
        <p>The ''Figaro'' is immediate and brilliant. Transparent screens, reassembled for each new act, suggest the life of a great house whose multiple rooms and corridors allow for encounters, assignations and eavesdropping. In this environment, people slide slowly and easily into 18th-century dress, maintaining as they do so a harmony of ivory and gray that gives an effervescent vitality to the few spots of color: Cherubino's blue purloined ribbon, the Count's red heels. Most important, the frank sensuality of Figaro and Susanna is not lost as their clothing becomes more formal: rather it gets shared, in an abundant celebration of love and laughter.</p>
        <p>''Don Giovanni'' is another story. Filled with a spill of dirt, the space is now an evil basement, and fancy dress is a signal of corruption. When Donna Elvira enters, she is observed not only by Don Giovanni and Leporello but also by a group of prostitutes and transvestites representing the world she has joined. Don Giovanni has blighted her life as he has those of everyone else he touches. Indeed, he has changed the emotional weather. Even the love between Zerlina and Masetto is mean and graceless. Leporello keeps going as a human being, but only by isolating himself inside a bubble of humor.</p>
        <p>One moment, when Don Giovanni at his last meal pulls entrails from a dead horse, has won the production notoriety, which is a pity when so much of it is strong and musical. The three superimposed meters of the first-act finale are effectively realized in Ron Howell's choreography, and the ending is powerful, with the men of the chorus rising to present Don Giovanni with his own special hell, all of them doubles of him. The people-hating cynic will find his cold light reflected back at him from all around throughout eternity.</p>
        <p>In a way, ''Cosi Fan Tutte'' is an even more cynical piece, because there is no moral compass and no divine punishment. Don Alfonso blisters lives as irrevocably as Don Giovanni did, but with urbane detachment. He represents the end of a line, traced through the operas by three linked characters. The Count, in ''Figaro,'' learns to accept the rights of others. Don Giovanni flouts them, whether exultantly or, as in this production, from raging emptiness. But it never flickers across Don Alfonso's fine and speculative mind that such rights exist.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vick, while he does not pursue these connections, evidently feels them. He does not want ''Cosi'' to be the way it is, and so he neatly withdraws its sting by offering it as a play within a play. The white space is now a rehearsal room, and the four young people are actors under Don Alfonso's direction. Where warmth flowed generously from the stage in ''Figaro'' and chilliness in ''Don Giovanni,'' here nothing does. Extras with mobile telephones keep reminding the audience that this is only theater. Nothing matters. Mozart's music, which keeps insisting that people are more than windup toys, is -- as much as possible -- sidetracked.</p>
        <p>In how it was sung and played, though, the music was variously triumphant on all three evenings. The ''Figaro'' cast was youthful and outstanding, led by Christiane Oelze as Susanna, Peter Mattei as Figaro, Marius Kwiecien as the Count, Maria Costanza Nocentini as the Countess and Marina Comparato as Cherubino. All of them worked with their whole bodies, and sang fully as characters, not performers.</p>
        <p>The ''Cosi'' lovers, forced into the latter role, kept springing out with their physical and vocal agility, which made them affecting. Alexandra von der Weth and Laura Polverelli were the sisters, Paul Austin Kelly and Nathan Gunn their swains, with Alan Opie a seemingly benign Don Alfonso, unaware of his cruelty.</p>
        <p>Don Giovanni, lacking self-awareness for different reasons, was vigorously sung and starkly portrayed by Natale de Carolis. Alessandro Corbelli was the lovable, shrugging Leporello. Nice points were made also by Gwynne Howell as the Commendatore, Bruce Ford as Don Ottavio, Barbara Frittoli as Donna Anna and Sandra Zeltzer as Donna Elvira.</p>
        <p>The London Philharmonic Orchestra, playing with vim and pace, was conducted by Andrew Davis in ''Figaro'' and Louis Langree in ''Don Giovanni'' and ''Cosi.'' ''Don Giovanni'' remains in repertory almost to the end of the month. All three productions will, adapting to need, provide Glyndebourne with its central repertory for years to come.</p>
