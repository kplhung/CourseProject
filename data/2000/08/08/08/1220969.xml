        <p>Searching for a way to bolster its sagging stock, Computer Associates International reassigned senior managers yesterday and said it intended to use spin-offs or other strategies to tap the value of fast-growing units that are currently overshadowed by the company's main businesses.</p>
        <p>The management changes start at the top with Charles B. Wang, the company's founder, turning over the job of chief executive to Sanjay Kumar, who had been president and chief operating officer. Mr. Wang (whose name rhymes with ''long'') will continue as chairman. He will devote his attention to creating new ventures for the company, which is based in Islandia, N.Y., and is a leader in software for mainframe computers and management of large networks, including data storage and security.</p>

        <p>Searching for a way to bolster its sagging stock, Computer Associates International reassigned senior managers yesterday and said it intended to use spin-offs or other strategies to tap the value of fast-growing units that are currently overshadowed by the company's main businesses.</p>
        <p>The management changes start at the top with Charles B. Wang, the company's founder, turning over the job of chief executive to Sanjay Kumar, who had been president and chief operating officer. Mr. Wang (whose name rhymes with ''long'') will continue as chairman. He will devote his attention to creating new ventures for the company, which is based in Islandia, N.Y., and is a leader in software for mainframe computers and management of large networks, including data storage and security.</p>
        <p>Many of the other management changes were related to the formation, announced yesterday, of iCan-ASP Inc., which will include Computer Associates' fast-growing collection of technology for so-called application service providers. Such companies, known as ASP's, provide services including accounting, e-mail and data processing to other companies over the Internet. Nancy Li, who is chief technology officer of Computer Associates, will become chief executive of iCan-ASP.</p>
        <p>Computer Associates said it was studying the best way to spin off iCan-ASP. Computer Associates also affirmed its plan to eventually spin off ACCPAC, which provides accounting software for desktop computers, and said that it was looking for ways to get more value out of its telecommunications joint ventures. It has retained Credit Suisse First Boston and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter as advisers.</p>
        <p>''We need to unlock the value and the talent of this company,'' said Mr. Wang, the company's 55-year-old founder, whose personal fortune has declined by more than $1.2 billion as Computer Associates shares have fallen from their 52-week high of $79.4375 to below $24 last week.</p>
        <p>Investors reacted with little enthusiasm to what many analysts described as minor tinkering. The company provided no financial details on the size of the ventures it intended to spin off, other than to say that their total revenues were small enough that it expected to make them up through growth in other businesses. It told analysts not to revise their estimates for the year. Computer Associates' shares edged up $2.3125, to $27.625 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
        <p>''The market is looking for better performance out of the core business,'' said Kevin M. Buttigieg, who follows the company for PaineWebber. ''They didn't really address that today.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Buttigieg said the company's biggest problem was a ''Y2K hangover.'' Many customers bought more large computers like I.B.M.'s 390 series than they needed while modernizing their systems to avoid Year 2000 computer disruptions. Until the sales of such hardware pick up again, Computer Associates and others that provide software for such computers will face a tough market, he said.</p>
        <p>Slow sales forced Computer Associates to warn Wall Street in June that its quarter ending June 30 would produce disappointing results. In late July, it reported net income of just $23 million on revenues of $1.14 billion for the quarter.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kumar, who is 38, said that the reorganization would be accompanied by more focused marketing in the core businesses, including a plan to assign some research workers to the field sales force to help close sales in new areas like software applications for Internet portals. The company will also start providing Wall Street with more financial information on fast-growing segments that it wants investors to pay more attention to, said Mr. Kumar, citing Computer Associates' $900 million in network-management revenues as an example.</p>
        <p>''There's so much sitting under the C.A. umbrella that we are not getting credit for,'' Mr. Kumar said.</p>
