        <p>The construction cranes and cement trucks are taking over the downtown here, like the artillery of a conquering army.</p>
        <p>Smack in the middle of the commercial district, a brick's throw from the falling-down houses that have symbolized Oakland for a generation, is the growing behemoth of an office tower -- the first to be built in the city in more than 10 years -- that promises to alter the landscape here for decades to come.</p>
        <p>All around that project, dot-com businesses are plowing down old walk-ups for shiny new headquarters or swooping down on boarded-up, sad-sack buildings and restoring them to the proud, handsome office complexes they once were. In short, downtown Oakland can boast that it is within striking distance of 1.6 million square feet of offices and stores, built over the last three years.</p>
        <p>That Oakland has become so popular, already facing the same space shortage, skyrocketing rents and gentrification battles that plague the rest of the San Francisco Bay Area, is an extraordinary testament to the new economy.</p>
        <p>The last hot property within commutable distance of Silicon Valley has long been the plain Jane cousin to San Francisco's prom queen, never noticed except for its missteps (remember Ebonics?) and flaws. From its slums, which rival the toughest in the nation, to its reputation for high crime (a reputation not always deserved, but hard to shake) to its poorly performing schools and deteriorated housing, save for a few choice neighborhoods that prefer to call themselves something other than Oakland, the city has had a bad rap for so long that Mayor Jerry Brown likes to say it has stagnated with ''diminished expectations.''</p>
        <p>Now, largely because it is -- or was -- the last affordable bastion in the Bay Area, and because it has courted new residents and businesses, Oakland is feeling the ups and downs of a boom. Those celebrating include Ask Jeeves, the $1 billion Internet search company, which is one of dozens of dot-coms that have staked a claim here, with a commitment to moving at least 700 employees into its new space from the nearby city of Emeryville.</p>
        <p>The Port of Oakland is getting in on the action as well, with a $727 million modernization. Forbes magazine is impressed enough to rank Oakland as No. 12 on its list of the top cities in the nation to do business, ahead of San Francisco (No. 42) and Silicon Valley's unofficial capital, San Jose (No. 29).</p>
        <p>But the pressure is building along with the boom. Oakland, always considered a Bay Area haven for the poor and dispossessed, has also become the last refuge for the middle class. Nonprofit organizations, renters and house buyers alike have been leaving the overpriced, overcrowded city of San Francisco in droves. They are coming to this city of 400,000 people as their best hope for an affordable place in the Bay Area. Soon, a real estate agent said recently, ''all that will be left is the wishbone.''</p>
        <p>All this new money gives Oakland an odd feel. In a scene from the new Oakland, dot-comers with Palm Pilots are sitting in Starbucks while homeless panhandlers who have lived here forever stand outside waiting to ask them for spare change. The hot real estate market is also creating a panic among members of the working class, who have made up the backbone of the city, as rents rise and renters are evicted, legally and not.</p>
        <p>Nancy Nadel, an Oakland City Council member whose district includes much of the prime development zones, said that real estate speculation had led to a housing crisis for the poor as landlords evicted longtime tenants and, sometimes illegally, raised rents. ''As new owners acquire properties at higher prices, they are raising prices higher than our somewhat weak rent control laws allow, and evicting people illegally,'' Ms. Nadel said.</p>
        <p>Oakland still has a lot of its old problems, too. Its crime rate, which has been dropping steadily, recently took an upturn. Poverty and homelessness, drug dealing and AIDS, all plague the city.</p>
        <p>And now, there are the new worries: skyrocketing rents, the condemnation of old buildings that have given refuge to the very poor and a growing sense of uneasiness on the part of many longtime residents, many of them African-Americans, that their city is now for sale.</p>
        <p>''I don't think we're getting enough attention focused on the housing needs going on here,'' said Linnie Cobb, a 62-year-old homeowner who has lived in Oakland most of her life. Ms. Cobb, who is co-chairwoman of the local chapter of Acorn, the national community advocacy organization, says she hears complaints all the time from people who wonder what is happening to their city.</p>
        <p>''It's bad when you have a whole community up in arms except for the yuppie types or the middle class or the rich,'' Ms. Cobb said. ''We're seeing a migration of yuppie types moving in, and blacks and minorities are being pushed out.''</p>
        <p>The newcomers are the city's biggest cheerleaders. John Dolby, marketing director for the Shorenstein Company, which is building a 20-story office tower downtown, said the falling vacancy rates for prime office space -- down to 1 percent (almost as low as San Francisco's) from 9 percent last year -- reflected a changing perception among wealthy companies.</p>
        <p>''There was a perception of Oakland that it was crime-ridden and dilapidated, which is not the case,'' Mr. Dolby said. ''And then Jerry Brown came in and the perception is changing for the better, blocks getting cleaned up, not only downtown but surrounding neighborhoods.''</p>
        <p>Sam Nassif, owner of the Waterfront Hotel on Jack London Square, was vice president of the city's Convention and Visitors Authority when it sputtered to a close in 1998. Now, as chairman of a revived bureau, he leads a 24-member board that can boast that Oakland's 2,000 hotel rooms are near capacity in peak times. An additional 630 rooms are slated to open in the next two years.</p>
        <p>A growing problem for the city is sparked by its war on decades of blighted housing. Since the city strengthened its antiblight laws two years ago and urged citizens to file complaints, it has issued 14,000 summonses for ugly nuisances, including trash cans left at the curb too long and building code violations. ''This is a very self-conscious effort at social engineering to get us on the train of economic revival,'' said Claudia Leed, a deputy city attorney.</p>
        <p>For some residents, the enforcement goes too far, punishing poor people who cannot afford to repair their houses to code. Slapped with fines that start at more than $700 and quickly climb, old homeowners may be pushed out of their only option at housing. This, a growing number of ministers and community organizations say, is a part of the consequence of Oakland's newfound popularity with the rich and middle class.</p>
