        <p>Kendall L. Francois, who admitted murdering eight women here over a two-year period, was sentenced today to spend the rest of his life in prison.</p>
        <p>The decision, which allowed Mr. Francois, a former school hall monitor, to escape a capital trial was made by Judge Thomas J. Dolan of County Court, who said such a proceeding would serve ''no good purpose.''</p>
        <p>Instead, he sentenced Mr. Francois to eight consecutive life terms without the chance of parole.</p>
        <p>Mr. Francois admitted strangling the eight women between 1996 and 1998. He stored their bodies in the home he shared with his family, but none of the relatives were ever charged in connection to his crimes.</p>
        <p>In testimony at his sentencing hearing, family members of Mr. Francois's victims made tearful statements about their losses, but the killer himself never looked up and his expression remained deadpan.</p>
        <p>''I know you won't look at me or look at any of us, because you are a damn coward,'' Pat Hoffman, an aunt of Mr. Francois's first victim, Wendy A. Meyers, said as she shook with rage.</p>
        <p>Others mourned that Mr. Francois had taken away the chance for his victims, all of whom were involved with drugs or prostitution, to turn their lives around.</p>
        <p>Christine Sala, a former drug addict who narrowly escaped becoming Mr. Francois's ninth victim, stood up to ''confront the man who took innocent peoples' lives and tried to take mine.''</p>
        <p>Now free of drugs, Ms. Sala said she was living proof that ''people can turn their lives around for the better.''</p>
        <p>Like the others, she had been attacked by Mr. Francois in his car. But while choking her, he inexplicably stopped and let her go. Ms. Sala ran to the police, who arrested him for assault and eventually charged him with the eight murders.</p>
        <p>''I hope you remember me for the rest of your life. I hope you remember who put you away,'' Ms. Sala said, sobbing. ''You will never be forgiven for what you have done. I hope they kill you in prison. Goodbye, Kendall.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Francois, now 29, remained mute. One of his lawyers told the court that he was ''deeply sorry for his actions'' but feared that anything he might say would be misconstrued.</p>
        <p>The only member of his family to appear was a cousin, Mon-Ray Francois, who has aligned himself with members of the victims' families. Several of them expressed disappointment that the killer would escape capital punishment.</p>
        <p>''If ever there was an instance where the death penalty should have stood on solid ground, this was it,'' said Heidi Cramer, the daughter of one victim, Sandra Jean French. Mr. Francois has tested positive for H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, and Ms. Cramer called it ''poetic justice'' that he may have contracted the virus from one of the very women he hunted.</p>
