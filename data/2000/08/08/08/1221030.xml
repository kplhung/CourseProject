        <p>Representative Rick A. Lazio, the Republican Senate candidate who emphasizes his New York roots and longtime residency as a characteristic distinguishing him from his opponent, the first lady, has confronted a political reality. The votes may come from New York, but a lot of cash for the race may lie in places like Denver, Cincinnati and Dearborn, Mich.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, who has criticized Hillary Rodham Clinton for what he perceives as the outside influence on her campaign by way of Arkansas, Washington and Hollywood, has embarked on his first cross-country fund-raising trip since entering the race May 20, visiting Colorado, Michigan and Ohio yesterday and California today. It is an effort to counter the expectation that Mrs. Clinton, with her celebrity, will continue to outraise and outspend him.</p>
        <p>In what is expected to be among the most expensive races in the country, Mr. Lazio, who has said he needs to raise at least $15 million, has  gathered $8.5 million, including $3.5 million left over from his House races, and has spent $2.32 million. Mrs. Clinton, who expects to raise $25 million, has collected $18 million but has already spent $11.6 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio will be the guest at several fund-raisers in private homes whose sponsors include Representative Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican who is a friend of Mr. Lazio's, and Senator Spence Abraham, a Michigan Republican seeking re-election and one of the sponsors of the Dearborn event. Mr. Abraham and Mr. Lazio both employ Michael Murphy as a campaign strategist.</p>
        <p>The campaign also declined to say how much Mr. Lazio expected to raise on the trip, which is scheduled to end Wednesday or Thursday. Mr. Lazio has held fund-raisers out of state before, particularly in and around Washington, squeezed in with Congressional business, but this trip will take him as far as Thousand Oaks, Calif., a Los Angeles suburb, which he is scheduled to visit today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's aides acknowledge that the trip is keeping him off the campaign trail at a time when he is seeking broader name recognition, though most polls show the race to be close.</p>
        <p>The fund-raisers, campaign aides said, do not entail soft money, the largely unregulated contributions that critics say have a shadowy influence on politics. Both Mr. Lazio and Mrs. Clinton have pledged to refuse such money, but only after the other does so first.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's campaign does not have any soft-money accounts, though independent groups using such funds have sponsored advertising featuring him. Mrs. Clinton's aides said she maintained two joint bank accounts for soft money contributions with independent groups that support Democratic causes.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton has been out of state as well, raising more than $500,000 over the weekend while visiting Martha's Vineyard with President Clinton. Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, said the fund-raisers included soft money as well as hard, the contributions that go directly to the campaign and are limited to $2,000 per donor.</p>
        <p>''Of course, the congressman would rather be campaigning in New York,'' said Dan McLagan, Mr. Lazio's chief spokesman. ''But the reality of the situation is Mrs. Clinton is raising millions and millions in soft money, mostly from Hollywood and left-wing groups across the country. She raised half a million in soft money on Martha's Vineyard just yesterday. We need to be competitive.''</p>
        <p>Republican officials said an out-of-state trip was inevitable for Mr. Lazio, who entered the race a little more than two months ago, after Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani dropped out after a diagnosis of prostate cancer and his statement that he was seeking a separation from his wife.</p>
        <p>''Every Senate candidate in a hotly contested race from any state has to travel outside their own state to raise money,'' said Mark Miller, executive director of the Republican Leadership Council, a group that helps finance moderate candidates and has sponsored advertising but not fund-raising for Mr. Lazio. ''But in the case we are looking at here, Lazio started late, he is going to have to work twice as hard and Mrs. Clinton is in places like Martha's Vineyard and Hollywood raising huge sums of money.''</p>
        <p>The trip comes as Mr. Lazio has limited his public appearances somewhat in the last couple of weeks to accommodate his schedule in Congress and some fund-raising. He used the Republican National Convention as the backdrop for more than two dozen interviews and attended a fund-raiser during a one-day visit, and last week made an appearance with John McCain, the Arizona senator, to criticize soft money and its influence on politics. He continues to give interviews by phone, including one yesterday morning with WROW-AM in Latham, north of Albany, his aides said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Lazio, in part because of his obligations in Congress, has not gone on a multiday swing since the week of July 4, when he toured upstate by bus. And he skipped most of the Republican convention, in part to attend fund-raisers in New York, including, he said, two on the night of Gov. George W. Bush's acceptance speech.</p>
