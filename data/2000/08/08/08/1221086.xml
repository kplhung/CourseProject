        <p>During Howard Safir's tenure as New York's police commissioner, crime dropped precipitously in all categories and the murder rate fell to its lowest level since 1964. But incidents like the torture of Abner Louima and the shooting death of Amadou Diallo, coupled with the widely held perception in many neighborhoods that the department's aggressive policies unfairly singled out minorities, brought police-community relations to a new low point.</p>
        <p>MICHAEL COOPER</p>
        <p>MARCH 28, 1996 -- After the resignation of William J. Bratton, Safir is named police commissioner. He is seen as more loyal to Giuliani; the two have been friends since working together at the Justice Department in the early 1980's.</p>
        <p>JULY 1996 -- Expands anti-drug initiative, conceived under Bratton, from its pilot program on the Lower East Side and in northern Brooklyn to Harlem and Washington Heights.</p>
        <p>NOV. 4, 1996 -- Travels to the Dominican Republic to try to muster support for a plan to station New York City police officers there to help catch fugitives. The plan later unravels as Dominican politicians and church officials call it unwanted intervention.</p>
        <p>MARCH 7, 1997 -- Undergoes double-bypass heart surgery.</p>
        <p>AUG. 9, 1997 -- Abner Louima, a Haitian immigrant, is assaulted by police officers in the bathroom of the 70th Precinct station house in Brooklyn. The attack, in which an officer shoved a stick up Mr. Louima's rectum, sets off anti-police protests. Federal prosecutors begin a broad investigation of brutality in the department.</p>
        <p>AUG. 14, 1997 -- In response to the Louima attack, Safir reassigns the precinct's two supervisors, suspends a sergeant and reassigns 10 officers.</p>
        <p>DEC. 14, 1998 -- Safir proposes taking DNA samples from everyone arrested in New York City, likening the process to fingerprinting and noting that it will not only help solve crimes but also exonerate innocent suspects.</p>
        <p>DEC. 31, 1998 -- Killings drop to their lowest level since 1964. New York City records 628 fewer killings than Chicago, which has less than half of New York's population.</p>
        <p>FEB. 4, 1999 -- Amadou Diallo, an unarmed West African immigrant, is shot dead in a hail of 41 police bullets fired by four police officers of the Street Crimes Unit.</p>
        <p>MARCH 15, 1999 -- Former Mayor David N. Dinkins and Representative Charles B. Rangel are among those arrested outside Police Headquarters as they protest the Diallo killing. The protests, led by the Rev. Al Sharpton, continue for two weeks; more than a thousand people are arrested, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson.</p>
        <p>MARCH 21, 1999 -- After police officials say that Safir may miss a City Council hearing on the Diallo case because of a scheduling conflict, he is spotted at the Academy Awards ceremony in Los Angeles. The tabloid newspapers dub him ''Hollywood Howard.''</p>
        <p>MARCH 22, 1999 -- Safir catches a red-eye flight and makes it to City Hall in time to testify at the hearing; new questions are raised about the propriety of the trip, which was paid for by a Revlon executive. A city ethics inquiry into the matter is never publicly released; Mr. Safir quietly repays the $7,100 nearly a year later.</p>
        <p>NOV. 30, 1999 -- State Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer releases a report that finds that blacks and Hispanics are disproportionately stopped and frisked by New York City police officers; police officials question his methodology.</p>
        <p>MAY 9, 2000 -- Announces he has prostate cancer.</p>
        <p>JULY 6, 2000 -- The Giuliani administration drops its objections to federal oversight of the police department, although it resists the installation of a formal monitor.</p>
