        <p>Electronic exchanges have been set up to let the corporate equivalent of day traders buy and sell everything from rolled steel to rolled bandages, but how can companies make sure that they get their orders delivered before the dealer in, say, Indonesia is paid? Well, banks have been solving such problems for centuries in the form of letters of credit, and yesterday, two big banks, Citigroup and Wells Fargo, announced a partnership to bring such services to Web-based commercial exchanges in conjunction with i2 Technologies, which makes industrial exchange software; Enron, the energy company that also runs data networks; and S1 Technologies, a banking software company. The venture, called FinancialSettlementMatrix.com, will offer electronic payments, short-term purchase loans and related transactions.</p>
