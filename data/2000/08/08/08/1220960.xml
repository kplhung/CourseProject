        <p>There is more than a little merriment in two one-act plays about the deaths of parents, combined under the title ''She Keeps Time,'' and none of it is gallows humor. Allison Eve Zell's ''Come to Leave'' and ''Pickling'' by Suzan-Lori Parks were written independently and with different intentions, but bringing them together in a staging by Scenic Route Productions and the Queen's Company, with both plays directed by Ms. Zell, creates resonances that make you notice details in both that might be missed in separate performances.</p>

        <p>There is more than a little merriment in two one-act plays about the deaths of parents, combined under the title ''She Keeps Time,'' and none of it is gallows humor. Allison Eve Zell's ''Come to Leave'' and ''Pickling'' by Suzan-Lori Parks were written independently and with different intentions, but bringing them together in a staging by Scenic Route Productions and the Queen's Company, with both plays directed by Ms. Zell, creates resonances that make you notice details in both that might be missed in separate performances.</p>
        <p>''Come to Leave,'' the more allusive and abstract of the two, actually takes the most direct approach to escaping from grief. A young woman, whose father died after driving her to Vassar to begin her freshman year, finds as she approaches graduation that her real education was her internal search for a way to let go of her memory of her father without losing her connection to him.</p>
        <p>At the beginning Lethia Nall, as the woman, slowly emerges from a closed steamer trunk in a black academic gown, whispering, ''I haven't spoken a word in years,'' and you find that easy to believe because through the rest of the 30-minute play she relies on movement and expression much more than on words to let you know what is happening to her. She says little about her father and speaks only one line directly to him: ''Our arguments gave me the strength of Moses.'' If the audience gets any sense of him, it is entirely through the emotions of the woman; the play is about her, not about death.</p>
        <p>Even with Ms. Zell directing her own work, this takes some extraordinary acting from Ms. Nall. After the woman steps out of the trunk, she keeps taking things from her past out of it, and we can see Ms. Nall make the character grow in poise and introspection with each hint of story an object evokes.</p>
        <p>And the story itself -- her story -- begins to seem funnier by the moment to her as she realizes that while she paid attention to grief for four years, all the time she was becoming a smart and thoughtful woman.</p>
        <p>At one point the woman begins a kind of word association on the ''Little Bo Peep'' nursery rhyme, and by the time she ends it, gazing at the audience and asking pointedly, ''What does it mean to lose your sheep?'' she has everyone laughing, even though Ms. Nall's face and movements have told us that what the character is really doing is throwing off obsession. The entire set piece becomes a meditation on theater's role in snapping bonds, and that so many levels of thought can be conveyed in so few words testifies to great skill in both the actress and the director.</p>
        <p>Ms. Zells's direction cannot quite overcome one problem posed by herself as the writer: we see the woman entirely in terms of a single experience unfolding through several years, leaving the uncomfortable suspicion that the story might be as much a personal diary as a creation. That can make the audience quite uneasy.</p>
        <p>There is no question about the robust independence of the middle-aged black woman speaking to us in ''Pickling.'' She calls herself only Miss Miss, but she can fill the whole theater and summon up a couple of other characters as full-bodied as herself.</p>
        <p>At the outset Miss Miss -- realized with deep subtlety and faultless comic timing by Jaye Austin-Williams -- seems even more confined than the woman in the trunk. She's in some kind of pantry, apparently wedged into a cylindrical space surrounded by towering stacks of her dead mother's canning jars, in which through a long life she had pickled whole orchards and farms.</p>
        <p>The action of the play is simply a dismantling of the pyramid of containers, but what a wild flight of hopes and memories is freed from them along the way. Some of what's in them reminds Miss Miss of a death she cannot ignore, though she labors mightily to: Orestes the mother killer or a wriggly knot of worms or a snatch of old voodoo ceremony are as likely to pop out of a jar as pickled beets or saved scraps of meat.</p>
        <p>But Miss Miss has other things in those jars, as shining as dreams, especially tokens saved from her one fleeting romance, which took place during moments when her mother's eyes were closed, with a lifeguard who lived next door. She has not the vocabulary to describe him, except as ''so strong,'' but in a few moments you know him.</p>
        <p>She has his laugh saved up and pops open a jar to let you hear it (a moment that leaves you breathless with laughter), and his breath, and the imprint of his lips and much more. During this opening up of the heart of Miss Miss, Ms. Austin-Williams lets you see an entirely different person inside this woman. You glimpse both at once, as if she were a transparent Russian doll.</p>
        <p>Of course, the mother's photograph is also pickled, and though the lid is never lifted on that jar, she slowly swells into a vast presence, so large that it was never possible, for many years, for Miss Miss to get around her through the door to the outside. But the mother died in the doorway, and as Miss Miss opens and discards jars she realizes ''there's nowhere else to go but out.''</p>
        <p>Strengthening her resolve with variations on a chant of ''Now, begin,'' she opens a hole in the wall of the past. Before she leaves, she takes the lid off a jar of sand her lifeguard had walked in and, rubbing it on her arms, feels for the first time since youth the warmth of the sun in the memory of his step. Then she grabs a hat from the debris she is walking out of and strolls toward a bright, bare yellow wall, looking, in Elizabeth Barrett Browning's fine phrase, ''a little sunburnt by the glare of life.'' As she lifts her face to the sky, she leaves you with the feeling that she's looking right at you. It is a blinding moment of elation so unexpected it makes you want to yell, and most people in the theater do.</p>
