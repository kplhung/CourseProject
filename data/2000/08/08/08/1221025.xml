        <p>Both the Republican and Democratic Parties say they plan to spend record amounts of money on get-out-the-vote operations this fall, showing that both sides expect the battle for the White House and Congress to be so tight that slight changes in voter turnout could carry the day.</p>
        <p>Officials with the Republican National Committee said they expected to spend $100 million on television advertising, phone banks, literature and a host of other activities intended to sway independent voters and energize core Republicans.</p>
        <p>Democratic Party leaders said they expected to spend half that amount -- enough, they asserted, to match what they described as a less experienced and less efficient Republican operation.</p>
        <p>The Republicans have traditionally focused more on advertising campaigns than on voter turnout operations, leaving much of that gritty trench work to religious conservatives, like the Christian Coalition, or single-issue groups, like the National Rifle Association.</p>
        <p>So their sharper focus on grass-roots organizing this year indicates a significant shift in strategy in an effort to win the election on what has long been Democratic turf.</p>
        <p>''We're trying to reinvigorate the party itself,'' said Terry Holt, a spokesman for Victory 2000, a branch of the Republican National Committee that will be coordinating the voter turnout effort in all states.</p>
        <p>But Democratic officials asserted that the Republicans, for all their money, were coming late to the war on the ground and would have little time to build effective operations.</p>
        <p>They also suggested that the Republicans were creating their own grass-roots operations because conservative groups usually aligned with the Republicans, like the Christian Coalition, have lost much of their potency. And they argued that undecided swing voters would be more receptive to the Democratic message.</p>
        <p>''The reason Democrats have been winning is because we energize voters on issues like Social Security, education and health care,'' said Michael Whouley, the senior strategy adviser for the Democratic National Committee and Vice President Al Gore's campaign.</p>
        <p>''They can spend as much money as possible, but it will be like the Wizard of Oz,'' Mr. Whouley said. ''It's a lot of blue smoke and mirrors. But when you pull back the curtains, there aren't any issues that will turn out voters.''</p>
        <p>Fred Meyer, chairman of Victory 2000, said the $100 million, a goal that was first reported in The Washington Post today, would be 50 percent more than the Republicans spent in 1996.</p>
        <p>Mr. Meyer estimated that $75 million of that would be split evenly between television issue advertisements and voter turnout operations, which include polls, phone banks, yard signs and mailings. The group will also be training organizers to work in the most competitive states.</p>
        <p>An additional $13.7 million would be used to defray administrative costs for the Bush campaign. The rest of the pot would go toward miscellaneous Victory 2000 costs.</p>
        <p>In addition to the $100 million, which will be raised by the Republican National Committee, Mr. Meyer said, state Victory 2000 committees would raise at least $50 million more for the voter turnout campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Meyer is a former chairman of the Texas Republican State Committee and a close ally of the Republican nominee, Gov. George W. Bush. He said one goal of the grass-roots campaign would be to identify undecided voters who are leaning toward Mr. Bush and then aggressively urge them to vote, using follow-up phone calls, mailings and personal visits. Similar efforts in Texas had swayed large blocs of undecided voters to Mr. Bush in 1994, Mr. Meyer said.</p>
        <p>The Democrats are planning to depend heavily on the A.F.L.-C.I.O. to do much of the heavy work of energizing Democratic voters, as they have in the past. Labor officials have budgeted $46 million for political activities in 1999 and 2000, the bulk of which will be spent on voter education and turnout activities in this fall's national elections.</p>
        <p>Steven Rosenthal, political director for the federation, said that unions would be trying to replicate their successes of 1996 and 1998, when they increased union participation by building old-fashioned ward and precinct systems in closely contested Congressional districts. The federation plans to focus its efforts on 71 districts in 25 states, Mr. Rosenthal said.</p>
        <p>''The key for us is the personal contact,'' he said. ''We are filling a void that parties used to fill.''</p>
        <p>The alliance of Democrats and labor will be strengthened this week by the endorsement of Mr. Gore by the United Auto Workers whose leaders decided tonight to do that, an official close to the union said.</p>
        <p>The Democrats are also building get-out-the-vote operations in African-American and Latino communities. Donna Brazile, Mr. Gore's campaign manager, said organizers would try to ''touch'' likely voters in those communities -- with mailings, phone calls or personal contact -- dozens of times before Election Day. Similar campaigns were highly successful in the 1996 and 1998 elections.</p>
