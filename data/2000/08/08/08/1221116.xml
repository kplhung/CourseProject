        <p>CATES-John Robinson, MD of 3 Pomander Walk died on the night of August 5th. John was a Psychiatrist, an actor, a painter, a loving friend and a devoted father. John is survived by Andrew John, Edward David, MD, and Alicia Jennifer. He died of complications following heart surgery. John was born on August 13, 1918 in Newnan, Georgia. He completed a six-year Medical degree from Emory University in Atlanta. He served in WW II as a ship's Doctor on a destroyer in the North Atlantic. After the war Johnny's heart was captured by New York City. It was here that he pursued a career in psychoanalysis, raised his three children and did much more. In retirement he pursued his passions for acting, as a member of the Actors Equity Union, and for painting, at the Art Students League. Friends and family will remember John for his caring heart, his graceful step and for his willingness to live life despite the rules. There will be a memorial service at 11:30 Thursday, August 10, at the Ethical Culture Society, 2 West 64th Street, in Manhattan. In lieu of flowers we are arranging for a plaque at the New York Conservancy Garden, details at service.</p>
