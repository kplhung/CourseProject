        <p>Doctors routinely overlook a serious sign of osteoporosis, the condition that leaves older people -- primarily women -- susceptible to repeated, often immobilizing bone breaks, according to a study being released today.</p>
        <p>The study, which looked at 1,162 postmenopausal women who had broken one or both their wrists, found that only a quarter had been evaluated or treated for the disease.</p>
        <p>The report was published in The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery and was prepared by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p>A broken wrist, the researchers said, is often the first sign of osteoporosis in women over 55, suggesting decreased bone mineral density, thus making bones more fragile.</p>
        <p>A woman who breaks her wrist at this age may double her chance of breaking a hip, the study said.</p>
        <p>Yet after analyzing patient records and pharmacy claims in the six months after the wrists were broken, the researchers found a serious failure to diagnose and treat osteoporosis.</p>
        <p>Indeed, for the oldest patients, those most at risk, the level of treatment was even lower.</p>
        <p>Only 9.1 percent of the women ages 85 to 89 in the study were being treated for osteoporosis; 4.2 percent of those 90 to 94; and 4.7 percent of those over 95. This compares with a rate of 36 percent in the women ages 55 to 59.</p>
        <p>The author of the study, Dr. Kevin B. Freedman, said the findings suggested that doctors needed to be diligent about making sure that postmenopausal patients being treated for wrist breaks received good follow-up evaluations.</p>
        <p>''Even in older patients,'' he said, ''treatment for osteoporosis does work to maintain or increase bone density and prevent fractures.''</p>
        <p>Osteoporosis is commonly treated with hormone replacement therapy or drugs that restore the mineral levels in the bones.</p>
