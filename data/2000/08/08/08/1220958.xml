        <p>I first heard the voice, an insinuating, whispering voice in my head, in Switzerland.

        <p>I first heard the voice, an insinuating, whispering voice in my head, in Switzerland. Inside the new Kunstmuseum in Lucerne, in the middle of an exhibition called ''Mixing Memory and Desire,'' somewhere between Joseph Reinhardt's late-18th-century paintings of Swiss peasants and a maze of 21st-century installation art, I heard it. I had climbed into a black-curtained booth, a theater in miniature called ''Playhouse,'' and had sat down to watch a singer projected on a tiny stage. I put on the headphones that were waiting on the chair.</p>
        <p>Suddenly a woman whispered in my ear, ''Sorry I'm late.'' I wheeled around to see who had invaded the booth. No one was there. The voice was in the headphones. As the singer onstage sang, the voice kept whispering next to me -- something about the singer, the song, a box under my seat, a gun, a crime to be committed. Then she left. I looked under my seat. Nothing was there. I left the booth and put the voice out of my mind.</p>
        <p>But the voice followed me to London. I was wandering around the Tate Modern and had almost finished seeing an exhibition of installation art, ''Between Cinema and a Hard Place.'' People were standing around watching a miniature movie in a puppet-size theater. They were motioning to their friends, ''You've got to see this.'' What was the big deal? I picked up some headphones. ''The Muriel Lake Incident'' was playing.</p>
        <p>''Is there any popcorn left?'' a familiar voice whispered in my ear. Soon I could hear a woman next to me munching popcorn,  quietly but audibly. How rude! I looked over. No one was there. The whisper started again: ''This isn't the film I thought it was. I thought it was supposed to be directed by Orson Welles.'' The voice disappeared, and shots rang out. The people next to me jumped, then smiled sheepishly at their friends.</p>
        <p>The voice belonged to Janet Cardiff, an artist from Lethbridge, Ontario, and it had me snared. When I learned that the voice could be heard in Whitechapel, the East London neighborhood where Jack the Ripper did his dirty work, I went. At the Whitechapel Library I exchanged my credit card for ''The Missing Voice (Case Study B)'': a pair of headphones, a Discman and a map of the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>The whispering voice ordered me to the back of the library. I went. I heard the rustling of newspapers. Was it real or was it Memorex? The voice pushed me into a corner and had me scanning the third shelf for a book by Reginald Hill. It was there. I pulled it down. The voice read a passage on page 88: ''She set off at a brisk pace.'' Then the voice inside my head said calmly but firmly: ''I want you to walk with me. There are things I want to show you.''</p>
        <p>We went up the stairs together, and she pointed out the peeling ceiling. She confided in me: ''I started these recordings as a way to remember, to make things more real.'' I understood. She led me out of the library and onto the street and treated me as an old friend. ''I sometimes follow men late at night,'' she told me. ''It makes me feel safe.'' That was eerie. I used to do that, too -- find ''a secret guardian angel'' on the street. ''I have red hair,'' she said.</p>
        <p>She was my guardian angel in Whitechapel. When it was time to cross the street, she reminded me to look both ways. This was London, after all, and Americans never know which way cars are going. As we gazed at the words ''Look left'' and then ''Look right'' painted in the gutter, she said, ''I'm glad they write that on the streets for people like me.'' But she was an odd guide. She kept imagining strange men about to commit crimes. And she kept pointing out banana peels on the sidewalk that just weren't there.</p>
        <p>It was hard to hear her whisper. On the tape there was Caribbean drumming. In the street jackhammers were pounding. And there she was, oblivious, telling a story about a man who spent 20 years looking for the woman he loved. He played the violin. She seemed to give careful directions, but I couldn't keep pace with her footsteps, tapping faintly right beside me on the sidewalk. I was having trouble navigating.</p>
        <p>The Pakistani restaurants were closed. It was Saturday. Only the workmen with their jackhammers were out. I walked blocks in the wrong direction, stretching my imagination to make myself think that I was actually seeing what she was pointing out. Finally, I reoriented myself at the Jesus Christ Spitalfields Church.</p>
        <p>As I looked at the brick buildings with clay chimneys and white lintels, she told me to to head toward a red-on-orange sign that said, ''Eat Drink Restaurant.'' At last I found it. At the moment of my navigational triumph, she told a spooky story from her childhood. She had found a man's body hanging from the neck. It turned out to be her father's suit, hanging out to dry. A real man walked by us yakking into his cell phone.</p>
        <p>''There is a row of men marching toward me,'' she whispered as we made our way down a narrow alley. ''They have pointy hats and striped beards.'' Striped beards? The sound of gentle kazoos filled my ears. Waiters were tossing buckets of water in the gutters.</p>
        <p>Finally, we sat down on a bench facing Bishopsgate Street. ''I like looking at the chimneys,'' she said. People had obviously begun to notice her. Or maybe they were looking at me.</p>
        <p>''People wonder why I'm talking into this thing,'' she said in her breathy voice. I could hear the click of her tape recorder turning on, turning off. She wanted to move on. It was a sunny day. The song ''Downtown'' was blaring inside my head, and it was hard not to walk to the music of the gentle bossa nova. As my angel and I strolled down the sidewalk together, I felt giddy.</p>
        <p>But she broke the mood. ''Woman's Body Found in Thames,'' she read from a paper on the newsstand. Then she saw him: ''There's a man in a suit coming towards me. His shirt collar is too tight.''</p>
        <p>She slipped into a nearby church. But for me, it was locked. She told me to wait in the garden. ''It smells like incense in here,'' she told me, as if we were on walkie-talkies. Outside I smelled flowers in the sun. She listened to the organ and reminisced about her father's heavy breathing in church and the way the sun used to move through the figures in the stained glass. I was locked outside, listening to bird song and looking at trampled thistle. Finally she came outside to join me and quickly noticed ''an older man with a black jacket, tuning his radio.''</p>
        <p>She told me her dream of a polar bear and pointed out a woman with red hair reading a book called ''Body Identified.'' Was she pointing herself out to me? It didn't matter. No one was there.</p>
        <p>At last we reached a McDonald's at the Liverpool Street train station. I had long since given up sorting out the layers of sound and story in my head. There were literary voices reading hard-boiled crime stories, loud birds in the plaza, skirmishes on the street, working people having lunch, a man singing lieder, another man saying, ''Her letter made no sense to me.''</p>
        <p>Suddenly she said: ''I have to leave now. I wanted to walk you to the library, but there isn't enough time.'' She left. Walking back quietly to the Whitechapel Library, I found my eyes wide open. I saw a man on a cell phone, iron manhole covers in the cobblestone streets, dog dung in the gutter, a fashion shoot on the sidewalk. The voice inside my head had finally stopped. I was cured.</p>
