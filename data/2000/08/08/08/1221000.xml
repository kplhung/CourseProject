        <p>In a Senate speech on Sept. 3, 1998, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, sharply criticized President Clinton's conduct in the Monica Lewinsky matter, but he voted against convicting the president in the impeachment trial, giving his reasons in a statement released on Feb. 11, 1999:</p>
        <p>On Mr. Clinton's Conduct</p>
        <p>To begin with, I must respectfully disagree with the president's contention that his relationship with Monica Lewinsky and the way in which he misled us about it is nobody's business but his family's and that even presidents have private lives, as he said.</p>
        <p>Whether he or we think it fair or not, the reality is in 1998 that a president's private life is public.</p>
        <p>Contemporary news media standards will have it no other way. And surely this president was given fair notice of that by the amount of time the news media has dedicated to investigating his personal life during the 1992 campaign and in the years since.</p>
        <p>But there is more to this than modern media intrusiveness. The president is not just the elected leader of our country. He is, as presidential scholar Clinton Rossiter observed, and I quote, ''the one-man distillation of the American people'' and, as President Taft said at another time, the personal embodiment and representative of their dignity and majesty.</p>
        <p>So when his personal conduct is embarrassing, it is sadly so not just for him and his family, it is embarrassing for all of us as Americans.</p>
        <p>The president is a role model, and, because of his prominence and the moral authority that emanates from his office, sets standards of behavior for the people he serves. . . .</p>
        <p>So no matter how much the president or others may wish to compartmentalize the different spheres of his life, the inescapable truth is that the president's private conduct can, and often does, have profound public consequences. In this case, the president apparently had extramarital relations with an employee half his age and did so in the workplace, in the vicinity of the Oval Office. Such behavior is not just inappropriate, it is immoral.</p>
        <p>And it is harmful, for it sends a message of what is acceptable behavior to the larger American family, particularly to our children, which is as influential as the negative messages communicated by the entertainment culture.</p>
        <p>If you doubt that, just ask America's parents about the intimate and frequently unseemly sexual questions their young children have been asking them and discussing since the president's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky became public seven months ago. I have had many of those conversations with parents, particularly in Connecticut, and from them I conclude that parents across our country feel much as I do that something very sad and sordid has happened in American life when I cannot watch the news on television with my 10-year-old daughter anymore.</p>
        <p>This, unfortunately, is all-too-familiar territory for America's families in today's anything-goes culture, where sexual promiscuity is too often treated as just another lifestyle choice with little risk of adverse consequences.</p>
        <p>It is this mind-set that has helped to threaten the stability and integrity of the family, which continues to be the most important unit of civilized society, the place where we raise our children and teach them to be responsible citizens, to develop and nurture their personal and moral faculties.</p>
        <p>President Clinton, in fact, has shown during the course of his presidency that he understands this and the broad concern in the public about the threat to the family. He has used the bully pulpit of his presidency to eloquently and effectively call for the renewal of our common values, particularly the principle of personal responsibility and our common commitment to family. And he has spoken out admirably against sexual promiscuity among teenagers in clear terms of right and wrong, emphasizing the consequences involved.</p>
        <p>Now, all of that makes the president's misconduct so confusing and so damaging. The president's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky not only contradicted the values he has publicly embraced over the last six years, it has, I fear, compromised his moral authority at a time when Americans of every political persuasion agree that the decline of the family is one of the most pressing problems we are facing.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, I believe the president could have lessened the harm his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky has caused if he had acknowledged his mistake and spoken with candor about it to the American people shortly after it became public in January.</p>
        <p>But, as we now know, he chose not to do this. This deception is particularly troubling because it was not just a reflexive, and in many ways understandable, human act of concealment to protect himself and his family from what he called the embarrassment of his own conduct when he was confronted with it in the deposition in the Jones case. But rather, it was the intentional and premeditated decision to do so.</p>
        <p>In choosing this path, I fear that the president has undercut the efforts of millions of American parents who are naturally trying to instill in our children the value of honesty. As most any mother and father knows, kids have a singular ability to detect double standards. So we can safely assume that it will be that much more difficult to convince our sons and daughters of the importance of telling the truth when the most powerful man in the nation evades it. Many parents I have spoken with in Connecticut confirm this unfortunate consequence.</p>
        <p>The president's intentional and consistent statements, more deeply, may also undercut the trust that the American people have in his word. Under the Constitution, as presidential scholar [Richard] Neustadt has noted, the president's ultimate source of authority, particularly his moral authority, is the power to persuade, to mobilize public opinion, to build consensus behind a common agenda. And at this, the president has been extraordinarily effective.</p>
        <p>But that power hinges on the president's support among the American people and their faith and confidence in his motivations and agenda, yes, but also in his word.</p>
        <p>As Teddy Roosevelt once explained, ''My power vanishes into thin air the instant that my fellow citizens, who are straight and honest, cease to believe that I represent them and fight for what is straight and honest.</p>
        <p>''That is all the strength that I have,'' Roosevelt said.</p>
        <p>Sadly, with his deception, President Clinton may have weakened the great power and strength that he possesses, of which President Roosevelt spoke.</p>
        <p>I know this is a concern that many of my colleagues share, which is to say that the president has hurt his credibility and therefore perhaps his chances of moving his policy agenda forward.</p>
        <p>But I believe that the harm the president's actions have caused extends beyond the political arena. I am afraid that the misconduct the president has admitted may be reinforcing one of the worst messages being delivered by our popular culture, which is that values are fungible. And I am concerned that his misconduct may help to blur some of the most important bright lines of right and wrong in our society.</p>
        <p>Mr. President, I said at the outset that this was a very difficult statement to write and deliver. That is true, very true. And it is true in large part because it is so personal and yet needs to be public, but also because of my fear that it will appear unnecessarily judgmental. I truly regret this. . . .</p>
        <p>We all fall short of the standards our best values set for us. Certainly I do.</p>
        <p>But the president, by virtue of the office he sought and was elected to, has traditionally been held to a higher standard. This is as it should be, because the American president, as I quoted earlier, is not just the one-man distillation of the American people but today the most powerful person in the world. And as such, the consequences of his misbehavior, even private misbehavior, are much greater than that of an average citizen, a C.E.O. or even a senator.</p>
        <p>On the Trial Vote</p>
        <p>No matter how deeply disappointed I am that our president, who has worked so successfully to lift up the lives of so many people, so lowered himself and his office, I conclude that his wrongdoing in this sordid saga does not justify making him the first president to be ousted from office in our history. I will therefore vote against both articles of impeachment. . . .</p>
        <p>Although the House managers have left me thoroughly unconvinced of some of their allegations, the evidence presented on others does lead me to believe that it is likely that there were occasions on which the president made false or misleading statements and took actions which could have had the effect of impeding the discovery of evidence in judicial proceedings. Whether any of his conduct constitutes a criminal offense such as perjury or obstruction of justice is not for me to decide. That, appropriately, should and must be left to the criminal justice system, which will uphold the rule of law in President Clinton's case as it would for any other American.</p>
        <p>What I must do is uphold the Constitution and decide whether the House managers have presented clear and convincing evidence that the president has committed a high crime or misdemeanor, which is to say whether they have demonstrated that his misconduct has so compromised his capacity to govern in the national interest that he must be removed.</p>
        <p>I conclude that the House managers have not met that high burden.</p>
