      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>This October, Ian Schrager will open his fourth New York hotel, the Hudson, on the western fringes of Midtown, which will distinguish itself from his other odes to permanent midnight with cut-rate rooms starting at $95 a night. The 1,000-room hotel will feature shopping, too. Mr. Schrager said last week that he had signed a deal for the first New York store operated by the owners of Colette, the Parisian boutique that puts Jeremy Scott T-shirts, Fendi skirts and odd paper products in congress with fashion editors and hordes of young Japanese tourists.</p>
        <p>The shop will be run by Sarah -- who uses only her first name -- a buyer for Colette and daughter of the store's owner. Introduced to Mr. Schrager by his interior designer, Philippe Starck, she said the unnamed shop ''will not be a mini-Colette.'' Indeed, she said it is to feature design products only and no clothes.</p>
