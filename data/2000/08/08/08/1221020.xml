        <p>It was the first sweltering day of Jets training camp, and it was clear that a defense scorched is a defense boiling mad.</p>
        <p>With most of his veteran colleagues having the morning off, linebacker Marvin Jones took it upon himself to ensure that the defense -- scalded by Coach Al Groh's criticism after the Jets' 37-24 loss to Green Bay on Friday -- would not be belittled for long.</p>
        <p>With the rookie free-agent running back Mike Stack moving to his right to receive a screen pass in today's drill, Jones got into position. With the ball nearly nestled in Stack's fingers, Jones sprung, sending the 253-pound Stack splattering to the ground in what was the most vicious tackle of training camp.</p>
        <p>With a total of nine tackles in the Jets' two preseason games, Jones is one of the few defensive players whom Groh has praised. Jones's hit today symbolized what Groh had expected to see more of against Green Bay. Instead, what he got from his defense could be summed up this way:</p>
        <p>''We stunk,'' linebacker Bryan Cox said. ''We didn't play real well, but at the same time we don't want to get down on ourselves and start being overly critical. We didn't perform well, and we all know it. The reason behind it? I'm not trying to figure out the reason behind it. There's no reason to get down and disgusted and point fingers. We just didn't execute well.''</p>
        <p>Cox can afford to be sanguine about the defense's play for now. The Jets have nearly a month before they return to Green Bay on Sept. 3 for the season opener. And neither team did anything special Friday because neither wanted to tip its hand about what it had planned when the result will count.</p>
        <p>But the Jets have placed a lot of emphasis on an improved defense,  and used two first-round picks to shore it up. So allowing Green Bay 409 yards of offense was troubling enough for Groh to lash the unit with criticism.</p>
        <p>Cox said that everything the defense has done so far has been ''vanilla,'' meaning it has executed only the basics. Still, Groh expressed surprise when one of his players said the whole team seemed flat in the loss.</p>
        <p>''I don't know what team he was looking at, but there was a part of the team I was looking at that couldn't be slowed down,'' Groh said, referring to the Jets' offense. ''Both offenses were on their game pretty well, and accomplished a lot in terms of production. Both defenses are saying they need to play a lot better next time.''</p>
        <p>There are, though, no such concerns about Jones. Groh has been with the Jets for four seasons, three as the linebackers coach before ascending to the top job. In that time, Groh said, he has never seen Jones when he was not either adjusting to a new system or recovering from an injury. Last season, Jones was second on the team with 92 tackles. In Jones's last healthy season before then, 1997, he had a career-high 127 tackles with 3 sacks.</p>
        <p>Now the early previews indicate that Jones may be back to his old form.</p>
        <p>''That's Marvin,'' Cox said. ''His thing has always been the health issue. When he's healthy, he's as good as anybody. He's a real physical guy. He runs very well. He makes a lot of plays.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>The rookie defensive lineman RICHARD SEALS is back from an arm injury that caused him to miss the Green Bay game and the preceding week of practice. ''It gives him a very short tryout,'' Groh said. ''Some young players understand right away there is no redshirt year in pro football and some don't.'' . . . Running back BERNIE PARMALEE and defensive end ANTHONY COOK did not practice. In addition, Groh gave everyone 29 years old or older the morning off. . . . Tight end ANTHONY BECHT will make the team and may even start, but he did not have any catches against Green Bay after making three receptions against New Orleans. ''I'd like to see the rate of progress between Games 2 and 3 be a lot higher than it was between 1 and 2,'' Groh said. . . . Wide receiver MATT FARMER, a rookie free agent from the Air Force Academy, was placed on the reserve/military list Monday because he had to report for his military commitment. The Jets will retain Farmer's rights when he returns to football . . . Defensive end ERIC OGBOGU was placed on the injured reserve list after clearing waivers Monday. He is expected to have shoulder surgery Tuesday. When asked if he hoped to get Ogbogu, who entered camp as a starter, back next year, Groh seemed less than enthusiastic. ''I'm just going to wait and see,'' Groh said. ''I certainly had hopes for Eric this season.''</p>
