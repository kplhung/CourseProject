        <p>Gary Carlin hands out a sheet titled ''Teacher's Laboratory Guidelines.'' It is a kind of cheat sheet for new teachers. Like a cookbook, it walks them step by step through the teaching of a 40-minute high school science lab.</p>
        <p>Two examples:</p>
        <p>Step 1: After bell rings, lock the door and begin your introduction.</p>
        <p>Step 6: Starting at Table A, walk around to each table and take attendance.</p>
        <p>And, an italicized note says: Inform students that they are not to call out your name for help. They must work together as a group and help each other. They may ask questions when you come to their table.</p>
        <p>''Don't worry if not everyone finishes the lab,'' Mr. Carlin told the teacher trainees. ''Be concerned about whether there is some understanding.''</p>
        <p>He had one more admonition: ''Time is the most critical thing here.''</p>
        <p>Practical tips like these are a central component of a crash course run by the City University of New York and the Board of Education to groom new science and mathematics teachers, an increasingly endangered species in New York City schools. The 35 students in Mr. Carlin's class at Lehman College in the Bronx, which finished last week, spent five weeks observing city summer school classes, absorbing theory and pedagogy  and sopping up as many practical pointers from Mr. Carlin and other experienced teachers as they could.</p>
        <p>Next month, they and 65 other math and science specialists taking the course at three other CUNY campuses will face their own high school and middle school classes, not as helpers or apprentices, but as full-fledged teachers.</p>
        <p>With a drastic shortage of teachers in areas like science and math, the New York City school system is one of the latest converts to programs like the one at Lehman that short-circuit traditional approaches to teacher education, which typically take two to four years before a student is certified as ready to teach.</p>
        <p>The alternative certification programs, which tend to attract people who might not otherwise have entered teaching, give them just enough training to enter a classroom in a matter of weeks and support them once they are there. Usually, the teachers must take additional education courses and pass the same certification tests as the teachers hired through traditional routes, but much of that happens after they start teaching, not before.</p>
        <p>It is an approach that has quietly gained favor as school systems from New York to California scramble to hire qualified teachers. The 11-year-old Teach for America program is one example of alternative certification, with which states have been experimenting for nearly 20 years.  Today, 41 states count on alternative certification programs to groom teachers, according to the National Center for Education Information, a Washington organization that tracks such programs. Some states, including Texas, California and New Jersey, draw more than 15 percent of their new teachers from these programs.</p>
        <p>Last year, the New York State Board of Regents, appalled by the number of uncertified teachers working in some of the worst schools, approved a shortcut to allow those with a graduate or professional degree but no teacher training to enter classrooms. Last month, the Regents opened the door for would-be teachers who had bachelor's degrees but had taken no education courses. Under both programs, students must take 200 hours of intensive training before they begin teaching and must pass two of the state's three certification tests, one in liberal arts and one in a specific field, like math or science.</p>
        <p>CUNY officials say the year-old science and math program, known as the Teaching Opportunity Program, shows that despite the fleetingly brief training period, teachers prepared this way can succeed. Many teachers at urban schools drop out after their first year, frustrated and discouraged, but of the 50 new science and math teachers the program provided for the city's classrooms last September, all but four or five are returning next month. And school administrators are already beginning to grab this year's crop.</p>
        <p>In this summer's session, 81 of the students had had no previous training or experience in teaching. Some were scared, and some even wondered why they had wanted to become teachers in the first place.</p>
        <p>''I go home and I'm like, 'It's so tough,' '' said Sydney Klopfer, 23, a recent graduate of the State University College at Oneonta. ''My mom keeps me optimistic.''</p>
        <p>Above all, they were hungry for tips. They knew they would face tough situations; they were already seeing some in the summer school classes they were observing. They knew that their ability to survive in September depended on what they learned from real teachers, like Mr. Carlin and Bart Bookman, a science teacher and assistant principal at Adlai E. Stevenson High School in the Bronx who also taught in the program.</p>
        <p>In Mr. Carlin's class one morning, Kim Bruno, 22, a biology major who graduated from the State University at Binghamton in December, expressed concerns about a science class she had observed that morning.</p>
        <p>''Twenty minutes into the period, this guy walks in,'' she said. ''He walks around the lab. He kisses each of the girls on the cheek. It was offensive. It was dangerous. They were using Bunsen burners and chemicals. The teacher did not do anything.''</p>
        <p>What would Mr. Carlin do? she asked.</p>
        <p>''Your lab is your kingdom,'' he told her. ''You set up the rules. You enforce them. You do subtle things to emphasize your authority, like tell students to change seats.''</p>
        <p>But while Mr. Carlin, a longtime high school science teacher and part-time administrator with a reputation for keeping order, assured his students that there were ways to maintain control, he did not sugarcoat the truth. He said that each fall, when a new crop of high school students arrives, ''I get nervous. I've got to establish myself once again as the leader of the class.''</p>
        <p>And, he added, while he works hard to appear calm while managing difficult students, when he is finished, ''I walk into another room, close the door and bang on the table.''</p>
        <p>The teachers-in-training split their days between summer school classrooms and their own classes in education theory and practice at either Lehman College, Hunter and City Colleges in Manhattan, or Brooklyn College. In the city schools, they taught short segments to accustom themselves to standing in front of a class.</p>
        <p>Walter Ensor, one of the teachers-in-training at Lehman, called his selection at the age of 41 a ''dream come true.'' A self-described perennial high school dropout, he finally attended college after years of working as a musician, and then decided to go into teaching.</p>
        <p>He had already taken the plunge as an uncertified teacher at an alternative high school, but said he was woefully unprepared and barely hanging on, and welcomed the opportunity to join the Teaching Opportunity Program.</p>
        <p>After several days of observing an earth science class at De Witt Clinton High School in the Bronx, he was asked to teach a segment on rocks.</p>
        <p>It was near the end of a double-period class. The room was air-conditioned but the 29 students were fidgety and tired. Some had their heads on their desks. Others were yawning. One read a newspaper.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ensor, a tall man with a perpetually worried look, handed out shiny black igneous rocks and dappled gray sedimentary rocks, and the students dutifully passed them around.</p>
        <p>Then, after a quick discussion of volcanoes and temperature, he abruptly started asking the students about their tastes in chocolate chip cookies.</p>
        <p>''What are some brands?'' he asked. ''What makes them different?''</p>
        <p>Suddenly the students were waving their hands to be called on. The noise level rose, but so did their interest. They hardly seemed to mind when he shifted gears and pointed out that rocks differ because they have different ingredients or because they have been heated and cooled differently, just like cookies.</p>
        <p>The ringing bell brought the students back to reality, and as their regular teacher reminded them about homework, they groaned.</p>
        <p>Despite the preparation, the teachers who went through the Teaching Opportunity Program last summer said they found their own classrooms daunting, especially during the first weeks. ''At times I felt overwhelmed,'' said Dinorah Capota, who taught earth science at George Washington High School in Manhattan during the last school year.</p>
        <p>Like many of her classmates, however, by the end of that first tumultuous year, she said, she was managing her classroom like a seasoned professional.</p>
        <p>A Dominican immigrant who worked as a chemical engineer and then stayed home to raise her daughter before entering teaching, she found herself teaching not only science, but also basic academic skills, like studying, reading graphs and outlining material. She combed the Internet for Web sites that would excite her students and reinforce the concepts she was teaching. Over time, she said, the students began to confide in her about personal matters.</p>
        <p>Her affection for them grew, too. As she described her classes recently, she pulled out a sheaf of photographs showing the students with model volcanoes and posters explaining the weather.</p>
        <p>She laughingly relates how, when she entered teaching, her husband asked her why she did not get a ''real job.''</p>
        <p>She said she had a simple answer: ''You develop a bond with the students. I can't leave them.''</p>
