        <p>The two chief organizers of Salt Lake City's bid to be host to the 2002 Winter Olympics pleaded not guilty yesterday to federal charges that they had conspired to bribe members of the International Olympic Committee.</p>
        <p>The defendants, Tom Welch, former president of the Salt Lake City bid committee, and Dave Johnson, his chief deputy, said they were eager to defend themselves in federal district court. A trial date was set for Oct. 16 in Salt Lake City, but defense lawyers said they would ask for a delay of up to a year to gather evidence.</p>
        <p>Welch and Johnson maintain that they violated no laws in paying more than $1 million to I.O.C. delegates and their families in the form of cash payments, scholarships, medical treatment and expensive gifts. The two have repeatedly said they were simply conducting business that had become customary for cities bidding on the Winter and Summer Games. Their lawyers have indicated that they want a delay in the trial so they can question I.O.C. delegates to show that it was common to shower them with exorbitant favors.</p>
        <p>The two bid officials have also said they acted with the knowledge of the Salt Lake City business and political community. Evidence uncovered in news reports last year clearly indicated that there was widespread awareness of at least some of their activities. A trial could prove extremely embarrassing to the community and its leaders as they prepare to play host to the 2002 Winter Games in 18 months.</p>
        <p>Welch and Johnson face one count of conspiracy to bribe, five counts of mail fraud, five counts of wire fraud and four counts of interstate travel in aid of racketeering. The charges carry a maximum of 75 years in prison.</p>
        <p>''We did not do anything that violated the law,'' Welch told reporters outside the federal courthouse in Salt Lake City. ''We did not do anything that other cities hadn't done. We didn't do things that should embarrass this community. I think that not only will we be vindicated and found not guilty, but history will put it in perspective.''</p>
        <p>The defense case would implicate hundreds of Olympic officials, Utah politicians and business leaders, Johnson told reporters. Explaining his and Welch's actions, Johnson said that people should understand the bidding culture that had developed in obtaining the Olympic Games.</p>
        <p>''We were involved in a culture a lot of people don't understand,'' Johnson said. ''Most people haven't been out of this country. There are people that live differently than we do and make decisions different than we do.''</p>
        <p>Welch, 55, and Johnson, 41, have said the cash payments were made to help impoverished athletes in developing nations. However, evidence has shown that a good deal of the money went directly into the pockets of I.O.C. delegates. Ten resigned or were forced out of their positions last year. In an effort to reform the bidding process, I.O.C. members are now forbidden to visit cities bidding on the Olympic Games.</p>
        <p>About 30 of the I.O.C.'s 113 delegates have been implicated in some form of misconduct, whether it be large or small, regarding bidding on the Games. Revelations have shown that similar bidding practices occurred in other successful bid cities, including Atlanta, Sydney, Australia, and Nagano, Japan.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the thorniest charge facing Welch and Johnson concerns $130,000 from a New York travel agency, Jet Set Sports, that prosecutors say the two men diverted for personal use. Lawyers for Welch and Johnson said the money was used for bidding purposes. Jet Set Sports later became an official travel agent for the 2002 Winter Games.</p>
