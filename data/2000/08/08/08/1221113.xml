        <p>BELZ-Philip. The entire Boys Town Jerusalem mourns the passing of Reb Shrage Feivel Belz, our esteemed Board Member and loyal friend of over three decades. He and his late wife, Sarah, were Chai Founders whose generous support enabled Boys Town to fulfill its mission of turning young boys from limited backgrounds into young men with limitless futures. Mr. Belz's commitment to Jewish continuity is evidenced by the many causes benefitting from his legendary tzedakah. As a tangible expression of his commitment to this ideal, he made his son and daughter in-law, Jack and Marilyn Belz, Chai Founders, who continue to offer assistance to Boys Town's 1,000 students. ''Let me hear your voice for your voice is pleasant'' (Song of Songs). The voice of Philip Belz's soul will continue to sing. May the family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Josh S. Weston, Chairman Michael J. Scharf, President Rabbi Moshe Linchner, Dean Rabbi Ronald L. Gray, Exec. V.P.</p>
