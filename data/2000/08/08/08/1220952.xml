        <p>If the movie box office, like the pop music charts, is ruled by the taste and purchasing power of high school students, why are there so few credible representations of adolescent life on today's movie screens?</p>
        <p>The American teenager was invented some time in the 1950's, a cultural byproduct of the baby boom, the rise of the suburbs and the explosive growth of television and the recording industry. From the start, the teenager was a source of anxiety and an object of longing -- the vision of a terrifying, amoral future and the image of an irrecoverably innocent past -- as well as an irresistible target for marketers of entertainment.</p>
        <p>The Eisenhower years saw the convening of Congressional committees to assess the dire menace of comic books and the supposed epidemic of juvenile delinquency. The rise of rock 'n' roll sparked a culture war that has never really abated through decades of psychedelia, heavy metal and gangsta rap.</p>
        <p>And through it all a lot of grown-ups got rich holding magic mirrors up to pimply faces, selling young people and the rest of the world a series of confused, beguiling fantasies about life in the shopping malls, study halls and dormitories of America.</p>
        <p>Over the last half-century, teenage life has seemed at once unalterable and ephemeral. Its defining themes -- rebellion against parental, academic and political authority, sexual and romantic exploration, wanton irresponsibility and uncompromising idealism -- recur from decade to decade, but the reference points are always perishable and specific.</p>
        <p>Nothing ages faster than youth culture. The pop songs and fashion statements that define one generation's horizons of experience quickly appear ridiculous to the children and younger siblings who follow. (Did you really think that haircut looked good? How could you listen to that?) But at last the bell-bottoms and make-out anthems are rescued from the thrift shop shelves and the cutout bins, rediscovered as retro chic, classic rock and old school flavor.</p>
        <p>The first teenagers are now grandparents. The cinematic emblems of their wild youth are either long dead (James Dean, Elvis Presley) or unrecognizably altered (Marlon Brando, Warren Beatty). But Hollywood's ambivalent attention to the young and its ardent courtship of them are perhaps more intense than ever. A summer that in box office terms seemed to be headed for disappointment a month ago has been miraculously redeemed, in no small part because of youthful enthusiasm for ''Scary Movie'' and ''X-Men.''</p>
        <p>But even if these movies appeal to young people, neither is strictly speaking a teenage movie. Since last summer, a parade of forgettable prom-date and college-sweetheart romantic comedies has marched into theaters and almost as quickly marched out again. As is so often the case, television has done a bit better, offering watchable prime-time soap operas with a canny, covert cross-generational appeal. And now, with ''American High'' on Fox, the nation's insatiable demand for reality-based programming has met its queasy fascination with the almost grown.</p>
        <p>I can't help wondering how many members of the generation depicted in ''American High,'' R. J. Cutler's documentary series, will be watching. My suspicion is that a significant segment of the audience will be people in their 20's and 30's, a group whose morbid devotion to programs like ''Freaks and Geeks'' and ''My So-Called Life'' couldn't generate sufficient ratings to save them from cancellation.</p>
        <p>A bit of personal disclosure is in order: I'm one of these people, and my complaint that there are no good movies out there for teenagers may really be an expression of my frustration that there are no good teenage movies out there for me. And this frustration may arise from the fact that my own teenage years -- the years of my most passionate and indiscriminate consumption of popular culture -- happened to take place in the 1980's, what should now be regarded as the golden age of adolescent cinema.</p>
        <p>Not that everyone, including me, necessarily thought so at the time. John Hughes, who produced and directed a string of winsome, bittersweet comedies in the mid-1980's -- including ''The Breakfast Club,'' ''Pretty in Pink'' and ''Ferris Bueller's Day Off'' -- was hardly beloved by serious cinephiles, and he has yet to be given sufficient credit for updating the elegant studio comedies of the 1930's in the post-production-code, blockbuster-driven Hollywood of his own era. By then, in any case, the youth picture itself already seemed formulaic and tired. In 1982, in this newspaper, Janet Maslin asked, ''Can there be anything about life in high school, especially high school in a suburban California high school, that the moviegoing public hasn't already seen?'' This was in a review of ''Fast Times at Ridgemont High,'' a movie that answered the question, Ms. Maslin acknowledged, with a qualified ''yes.''</p>
        <p>Many high school seniors who have been going to licit, unaccompanied viewings of R-rated movies for less than a year were born during the first release of ''Ridgemont High,'' and they may marvel at the aspects of life in high school that the film shows that the moviegoing public no longer sees. The movie, directed by Amy Heckerling, is best remembered for starting the film careers of Sean Penn, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Cameron Crowe, who wrote the screenplay based on a novel he had written after spending a year at a suburban California high school and who went on to direct the fine school-of-John-Hughes romance ''Say Anything'' (as well as ''Jerry Maguire''). But it is most remarkable for its candor about the sexual lives of its characters.</p>
        <p>Stacy Hamilton, the high school junior played by Ms. Leigh, loses her virginity, painfully and half consensually, to a 26-year-old stereo salesman who doesn't bother to call her again. Later, pregnant after an unsatisfying encounter with one of her classmates, she has an abortion, an occurrence almost unimaginable in the cautious Hollywood of today. But from these grim events, Ms. Heckerling and Mr. Crowe managed to conjure a plausible happy ending, in which Stacy ends up going steady -- but not going all the way -- with the shy, decent Mark Ratner.</p>
        <p>''Fast Times at Ridgemont High'' arrived before ''date rape'' and ''secondary virginity'' had entered the lexicon as slogans in the continuing ideological struggle over the sexuality of young people, young women in particular. It tackled this delicate subject without excessive moralism or melodrama. Some of the film's more graphic and uncompromising scenes were cut, but the movie retains a feeling of unsentimental honesty that somehow doesn't spoil its governing spirit of lighthearted comedy.</p>
        <p>In the last year or so, movies like ''Election,'' ''Rushmore'' and ''Outside Providence'' have attempted a similar blend of seriousness and humor, and they have suffered at the box office despite critical praise. But these are not so much teenage movies as movies that use the universality of teenage experience to tell delicate, idiosyncratic stories about sexual politics, class antagonism and the mysteries of desire. ''Election'' and ''Rushmore'' also trotted out two of the icons of 80's teen-movie bad behavior -- Matthew Broderick of ''Ferris Bueller's Day Off'' and Bill Murray of ''Meatballs'' and ''Caddyshack'' -- and subjected them to brutal comic debunking. It turns out that Ferris grew up to be the kind of teacher he loved to torment and that Bill Murray's smug infantile charm ripened into chastened middle-aged charm.</p>
        <p>But where are this year's equivalent movies -- for mature audiences of any age -- about being young? Since January, alongside the clockwork release of Freddie Prinze Jr. vehicles (the latest and weakest of which, ''Boys and Girls,'' is about to reopen, a last stop on its way to video), a handful of flawed, worthy examples have come and just as quickly gone, including Sarah Kernochan's ''All I Wanna Do'' and Colette Burson's ''Coming Soon,'' which lasted all of a week on a single New York screen.</p>
        <p>Ms. Burson's sly farce about a high school senior looking for sexual satisfaction was evidently too hot for the big studios or the M.P.A.A. to handle. The display of semen to comic effect -- most recently and explosively evident in ''Scary Movie'' -- is permissible, but frank discussion of female orgasm remains taboo. A strange hypocrisy about sex -- too complex and involuted to be a simple double standard -- haunts the culture. The most interesting youth movies -- ''Road Trip'' (featuring MTV star Tom Green), ''Loser'' (uniting Jason Biggs from ''American Pie'' with Mena Suvari from ''American Beauty'') and even ''Scary Movie'' in addition to the more serious ones I've mentioned -- at least engage this hypocrisy.</p>
        <p>The equation of sex with other bodily functions -- its reduction to the level of scatology -- isn't so much an assault on taboos as a way of evading them. Strange sensations and scary emotions are neutralized by being made occasions for infantile humor. ''Scary Movie'' tries to make its audiences feel safe by turning male sexual anxiety -- about being straight or gay, about the adequacy of one's equipment -- into occasions for unembarrassed laughter. ''Road Trip,'' with unlikely grace, balances this kind of comedy with the old-fashioned romantic kind and even manages to respect its female characters (despite its propensity for showing them stripped down to their underwear).</p>
        <p>Is there any place for a teenage romantic comedy that illuminates the risk and absurdity of sexual initiation without the protection of gross-out humor? Ms. Heckerling's new film, ''Loser,'' makes an attempt, but the brave realism and satiric accuracy that distinguished both ''Fast Times at Ridgemont High'' and ''Clueless,'' Ms. Heckerling's 1996 updating of Jane Austen's ''Emma,'' seem to have deserted her -- or else to have been taken away. There are glimpses of the danger that haunted Ridgemont High: the heroine works as a waitress in a sleazy strip club, and the foppish fraternity-boy villains keep a stash of roofies, or date rape pills. But the movie skitters away from its darker implications and ends up hovering in a confused limbo between romance and satire rather than achieving equipoise between them.</p>
        <p>But 10 or 15 years from now, everything may look different, which is to say, nothing may have changed. ''Loser'' and ''Election'' may have found their way into the home-viewing canon of wistful 30-year-olds who stare in mute incomprehension at what the kids are watching and think, Where are the teenage movies for me today? Where is my so-called life?</p>
