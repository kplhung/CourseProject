      <abstract>
        <p>Dr Connie Dong letter on Aug 1 article on Lasik procedure to correct vision problems; says patients will still need routine eye care</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It is dangerous to suggest that anyone who has undergone a successful Lasik procedure no longer needs routine eye care (''Laser Eye Surgery's Turf War'').</p>
        <p>Someone who was very nearsighted before the procedure may have 20/20 vision afterward without corrective lenses, but anatomically, that person is still very nearsighted and still at risk for retinal problems associated with myopia. It is simply a myth that someone who has clear vision without glasses has healthy eyes.</p>

        <p>Optometrists do more than just fit glasses and contact lenses. We diagnose and medically treat eye diseases, and we do an excellent job co-managing surgical cases. We  deliver the majority of routine eye care in the United States and, in what we probably do better than anyone else, provide a means to  clearer vision, be it glasses, lenses or laser correction.</p>
