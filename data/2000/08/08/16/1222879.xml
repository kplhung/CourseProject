        <p>In Paris, a Bit of Home</p>
        <p>Jean-Georges Vongerichten, who was born in France, plans to take his style of international cooking to Paris next spring, when he is to open Taboo, on Avenue Matignon, steps from the chic Faubourg St.-Honore on the Right Bank. His partner is Francois Pinault, the owner of Christie's auction house, whose Paris branch is next to the restaurant and will be joined to it. Taboo, which like its name will hint at the exotic, will resemble Mercer Kitchen in design, and the food will have Vong's Asian accents, Mr. Vongerichten said.</p>

        <p>In Paris, a Bit of Home</p>
        <p>Jean-Georges Vongerichten, who was born in France, plans to take his style of international cooking to Paris next spring, when he is to open Taboo, on Avenue Matignon, steps from the chic Faubourg St.-Honore on the Right Bank. His partner is Francois Pinault, the owner of Christie's auction house, whose Paris branch is next to the restaurant and will be joined to it. Taboo, which like its name will hint at the exotic, will resemble Mercer Kitchen in design, and the food will have Vong's Asian accents, Mr. Vongerichten said.</p>
        <p>''Paris does not need another gastronomic restaurant,'' he said. ''This will be more casual and less expensive, costing about $40 for lunch and $75 for dinner. I'm planning to hire a young Parisian chef.''</p>
        <p>Behind Closed Doors</p>
        <p>Just because a restaurant is closed at this time of year does not necessarily mean the owners are taking it easy: at a number of places, face-lifts are going on. Restaurants that are welcoming work crews in the kitchens and dining rooms include San Domenico (closed from Aug. 24 through Sept. 5), Lespinasse (which plans to reopen Sept. 5), EQ Restaurant (reopening Sept. 5), Le Perigord (reopening Aug. 23), Zoe (reopening Friday) and Sofia Il Valletto, which will become Il Valletto 2000 when it reopens after Labor Day.</p>
        <p>A Nordic Cafe</p>
        <p>In October, when the American-Scandinavian Foundation opens its new Scandinavia House at 58 Park Avenue (38th Street) to promote Nordic culture, its cafe will be run by Marcus Samuelsson, the chef at Aquavit, and his partner, Hakan Swahn. It will be open for breakfast, lunch and tea until 5 p.m. (Scones with lingonberry jam, anyone?) At Christmas, Mr. Samuelsson will oversee the annual smorgasbord.</p>
        <p>Short Orders</p>
        <p>The Dining Room, the uptown sibling of the Screening Room in TriBeCa (but without films), has opened at 154 East 79th Street. The two-story space, formerly Trois Jean, was redone by Larry Bogdanow. Mark Spangenthal, the Screening Room chef, now fries his famous artichokes on the Upper East Side, too.</p>
        <p>Moustache, a Middle Eastern place with locations in the East and West Village, has opened Mamlouk, 211 East 4th Street, where the atmosphere is less casual and meals are prix fixe at $30.</p>
        <p>Matthew Kenney, whose restaurant group owns Matthew's, Mezze, Canteen and Commune, is about to leap across the country to open a restaurant in Portland, Ore., in the fall. It will have a name suggesting a big group feed: Commissary.</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 23, 2000, Wednesday  A brief report in the Off the Menu column last Wednesday about Commissary, a new restaurant Matthew Kenney is opening in the fall, misstated its location. It is in Portland, Me., not Portland, Ore.</p>
