        <p>An 85-year-old Rockland County man faces deportation for having served as an armed guard in a concentration camp where 42,000 Jews and other prisoners were tortured and killed.</p>
        <p>A United States immigration judge in Manhattan ruled on Monday that Michael Gruber, a retired auto mechanic who lives in New City, concealed his Nazi past on his immigration application more than 40 years ago and should be deported to Austria, where he holds citizenship.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gruber's lawyer, Robert A. Murtha, said he planned to appeal. ''I was very unhappy with the decision,'' Mr. Murtha said. ''For one, the client was too sick to cooperate in the case.''</p>
        <p>During the yearlong legal proceedings, Mr. Gruber admitted that he served as a Waffen SS guard during World War II, but denied that he had served inside the Sachsenshausen concentration camp or that he had participated in the murder and torture there.</p>
        <p>Judge Robert D. Weisel, however, wrote that Nazi records gathered by the government proved beyond a doubt that Mr. Gruber had served at the camp from January 1943 to September 1944. Service in a concentration camp is a legal basis for deportation.</p>
        <p>''He was part of the machinery of brutalization and annihilation at the Sachsenshausen concentration camp,'' said Eli M. Rosenbaum, director of the Office of Special Investigations, the Justice Department unit that tracks down and prosecutes Nazi war criminals. ''The job of all of the guards there was to enforce this regime of ghastly persecution.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gruber, who is being treated for kidney cancer, was an auto mechanic at Volkswagen in Queens until he retired in 1979. He lived a quiet life in Rockland County with his wife of 65 years in New City until news of his Nazi past spread, Mr. Murtha said.</p>
        <p>The Office of Special Investigation first contacted Mr. Gruber six years ago, Mr. Murtha said. Mr. Gruber, who was born in Croatia, admitted from the beginning that he had served in the elite armed guard unit. He said that he had been drafted into the SS in 1942. Mr. Gruber also admitted that he had served in the region around Sachsenhausen, but said that he had guarded prisoners at the train station, not the concentration camp.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murtha argued in court that no direct evidence proved that Mr. Gruber had participated in any persecution.</p>
        <p>''I argued that without evidence of direct participation in any acts of persecution, that he was not deportable,'' Mr. Murtha said. ''The judge disagreed. That will be the basis of the appeal.''</p>
        <p>In harsh language, the judge wrote that concentration camp guards ''shall be consigned until the end of human history as the ultimate in the personification of evil.''</p>
        <p>The Office of Special Investigations seeks out Nazi criminals who have hid their wartime activities and prosecutes them for deportation.</p>
        <p>''Hollywood has this conception that survivors recognize someone on the street and that starts the investigation'' Mr. Rosenbaum said.</p>
        <p>Instead, Mr. Rosenbaum said, his department gathers information on 70,000 Nazis and Nazi collaborators from archives throughout Europe and then compares the records with United States immigration records. The office, which was formed in 1979, has had 53 people deported.</p>
        <p>''This case is like virtually all of the others, '' Mr. Rosenbaum said. ''It's like looking for a needle in a haystack.''</p>
