        <p>To look at the weatherbeaten 69-year-old singing cowboy known as Ramblin' Jack Elliott, you would never guess that he began life as Elliott Adnopoz, the son of a middle-class Jewish doctor.</p>
        <p>While growing up in Brooklyn, he recalls in ''The Ballad of Ramblin' Jack,'' his daughter Aiyana's touching and acutely perceptive documentary portrait, the closest thing to bucking broncos he encountered were horses pulling milk trucks down Linden Boulevard.</p>
        <p>Among other things, Ms. Elliott's compelling documentary, which opens today at the Film Forum, is a poignant case study of a peculiarly American obsession: the mania for self-invention. The movie doesn't shy away from revealing the heavy price that such self-invention can entail. While deeply respectful of the artist, folk-singing legend and archivist who Mr. Elliott became, ''The Ballad of Ramblin' Jack'' is also a devastating portrait of a man so consumed by living out his fantasy that he is unable to meet his most basic family responsibilities.</p>
        <p>The movie follows Ms. Elliott, who grew up without ever really knowing her father, on the road with him as she tries to secure an in-depth one-on-one film interview. He ultimately eludes her. By the end of the movie, you begin to suspect that the reason for his evasion might be that he knew if he stepped outside his own myth for even five minutes he would risk psychic disintegration.</p>
        <p>You also wonder if the same might hold true of that other self-created folk music legend, Bobby Zimmerman, who turned himself into Bob Dylan a decade after Ramblin' Jack adopted his fantasy alter ego. Mr. Dylan, incidentally, is a thorn in Mr. Elliott's side. As various witnesses recall it in the film, in the early 1960's Mr. Dylan became Mr. Elliott's starry-eyed acolyte, studying and imitating the stage moves and storytelling style that Mr. Elliott had himself gleaned from Woody Guthrie.</p>
        <p>But once Mr. Dylan had absorbed what he needed, he severed their connection, leaving Mr. Elliott feeling ripped off. In the film we hear from Arlo Guthrie, Odetta, Dave Van Ronk and Kris Kristofferson, but not from Mr. Dylan.</p>
        <p>But as the movie makes clear, Mr. Elliott, through his travels and accumulated musical lore, fully earned his stage name and legend. Obsessed with all things western since early childhood, he was a rodeo fanatic and an avid follower of the Grand Ole Opry on the radio. At 14 he ran away from home and joined a rodeo where he worked as groom and learned to play the guitar.</p>
        <p>After hearing Guthrie on the radio in 1950, he was so smitten with his  rugged, plain-spoken style and passionate identification with the common man that he visited him and ended up living in the Guthrie household. In the mid-50's, Mr. Elliott traveled all over the country busking and collecting blues and early country songs.</p>
        <p>For a time he formed a memorable musical partnership with Derroll Adams, an Oregon banjo-picker whose deep voice contrasted dramatically with Mr. Elliott's high, twangy one. He also married June Hammerstein, a young actress who became his de facto road manager while he toured Europe. Vintage film clips and photographs from the 1950's and 60's show him to have been a handsome swaggering cowboy rogue, and one can only imagine the trail of broken hearts he left behind.</p>
        <p>By the time Mr. Elliott returned to the United States in 1961, his legend had preceded him in the booming Greenwich Village folk scene, where he was acknowledged as the best flat-picking folk guitarist. But folk music took more commercial directions that he despised. He went his own way, remaining a wandering minstrel and folkie purist who over the next three and one-half decades barely eked out a living.</p>
        <p>He also married three more times. His fourth wife, Martha (the filmmaker's mother), a salty, effervescent woman, does what almost everyone else does when asked about Mr. Elliott's quirks: she throws up her hands and flashes the hardy smile of someone who survived him.</p>
        <p>The film doesn't dwell on Mr. Elliott's road weariness, near-poverty and bouts with drugs during the many lean years. Belated honors finally arrived when his first recording in 20 years, ''South Coast,'' won a Grammy for best traditional folk album in 1996, and President Clinton awarded him the National Medal of Arts in 1998. But materially speaking, his life is still a struggle to make ends meet.</p>
        <p>The reasons for Mr. Elliott's lack of commercial success are obvious. He is remembered by everyone as unreliable and disorganized to the point that he was unable to plan a show ahead of time. And although he has written some fine original songs, none have entered the canon the way Guthrie's and Mr. Dylan's have. Just one valuable copyright could have made all the difference. Yet, in a mythical sense, this may be how Mr. Elliott really prefers to be: obscure, legendary, pure to the end, but poor.</p>
