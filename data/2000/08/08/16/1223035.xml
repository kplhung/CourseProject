        <p>A career-threatening injury could shake a young pitcher. Greg Wooten, however, has become even more confident after missing parts of two seasons because of ''Tommy John''arm surgery.</p>
        <p>Even at 6 feet 7 inches and 210 pounds, the right-handed Wooten was never solely a power pitcher. He had a sinking two-seam fastball that was clocked as high as 93 miles an hour while he was earning player of the year honors in the Seattle Mariners' organization in 1996 and making a successful jump to Class AA in '97. But Wooten, now with New Haven of the Class AA Eastern League, also came at hitters with a slider, changeup and splitter. So dealing with a little less gas on his fastball didn't require a huge adjustment.</p>
        <p>''I'm pretty much the same type of pitcher I was before,'' said Wooten, the Mariners' third-round draft pick in 1995. ''I throw the same pitches. I don't think there's any difference.''</p>
        <p>Wooten, 26, completed his fourth shutout of the season Sunday, blanking New Britain, 4-0, to improve to 15-3 with a 2.41 earned run average. He allowed six hits and walked two batters, just the second time in 22 starts he has allowed more than one walk.</p>
        <p>''Last year, back at high-A Lancaster, my velocity wasn't as high yet,'' he said. ''I worked on my command and that's why my control is better. I didn't have control problems before, but I learned to trust my stuff more and not give so much credit to the hitter. Now, I throw my first pitch over and if you hit it, you hit it. But I don't have to work so many deep counts.''</p>
        <p>The Oregon native has walked just 12 batters in 153 innings this season. He leads the Eastern League in shutouts and complete games (six).</p>
        <p>''He got it up to 91 the other night,'' Ravens Manager Dan Rohn said. ''So he's getting most of it back. But he's really learned how to pitch since the injury. He pitches to his strengths but also to the hitter's weaknesses. He now uses his secondary pitches to get guys out.''</p>
        <p>Wooten's hardest stuff is usually 86-90 miles an hour these days, fast enough to get inside on Eastern League hitters. And he's not afraid to go there. While Wooten has walked just 12 batters, he has hit seven.</p>
        <p>''They say the second year you regain some velocity,'' said Wooten, who has a 28-inning scoreless streak this year and went 36 innings without giving up a walk. ''But I'm not concerned about velocity, just control and command.''</p>
        <p>Wooten opened the 1998 season on the disabled list, pitched six games and went back on the d.l. in July. The ligament in his elbow had stretched and frayed and eventually it had torn.</p>
        <p>''Any time you have major surgery, you're hesitant to do it because you never know if you'll come back,'' he said. ''But I realized I wasn't going to get to the big leagues the way things were.''</p>
        <p>EASTERN LEAGUE</p>
        <p>The Binghamton Mets had their winning streak snapped at 15 games last Wednesday with an 11-9 defeat against Trenton. The streak was the longest in the minors this year. ... The Norwich right-hander Christian Parker (12-5) had his scoreless innings streak stopped at 40 last week. That was the longest streak in pro ball, according to Howe Sportsdata, since 1994.</p>
        <p>NEW YORK-PENN LEAGUE</p>
        <p>Doug Waechter, a third-round selection of Tampa Bay in 1999, threw the league's first no-hitter of the season in a 2-0 victory over the Pittsfield Mets last Thursday. Waechter, a 19-year-old with a fastball that hits the 90's, a curve and a changeup, had to retire 28 batters to complete the no-hitter. Catcher Alex Marconi dropped the third strike on the third out of the ninth, then fired the ball over the first baseman's head and into right field. After Manager Dave Silvestri made a trip to the mound, Waechter got the final out on a pop-up to third. Pittsfield's John Wilson had a 17-game hitting streak snapped, one short of Jay Payton's franchise record in 1994.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>Tim Raines has rejoined the Somerset (N.J.) Patriots of the independent Atlantic League in hopes of making the United States Olympic team. Raines will be with the team until Aug. 24, which will include a road trip to Newark. He played four games last month, batting .364. ''I feel good about his chances to make the team,'' said Bob Watson, co-chairman of the Olympic team's selection committee and the former Yankee general manager. Newark's Bobby Bonds Jr. has a 17-game hitting streak, batting .481 during that stretch. ... Drew Henson has left the Chattanooga Lookouts to attend University of Michigan football practice. Henson, the Wolverines' quarterback, batted just .172 in 16 games after being traded to the Reds' organization in the deal that brought Denny Neagle to the Yankees. With Norwich, Henson batted .287 with 7 homers and 39 runs batted in over 59 games.</p>
