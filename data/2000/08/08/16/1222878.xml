        <p>Chalk up another victim of America's eat-on-the-run workplace culture.</p>
        <p>First it was the French. Traditionalists watched in horror as white-collar drones in the homeland of haute cuisine, caught up in the pressures of the global economy, began abandoning the wine-soaked three-hour lunch in the 1980's.</p>
        <p>But who would have thought Australians -- that independent-minded, fun-loving lot Down Under -- would also succumb to the capitalist credo that productivity and profit-making constitute a higher calling than a leisurely midday meal?</p>
        <p>Alas, the evidence of the Australian office worker's apostasy is everywhere. Start with the upscale rotating Summit restaurant, situated atop a skyscraper in the heart of the business district, where lunchtime business bustled a decade ago. ''They used to fill the buffet from 1 to 3,'' said Jenny-Lee Stefas, who took over last year as sales and marketing manager.</p>
        <p>How times have changed. By 1999, even after a refurbishment that included funky red carpet, sleek white chairs and a minimalist ''Space Odyssey'' theme, business had dropped off so much that on some days  only three or four customers showed up, Ms. Stefas says. That left room for 347 more.</p>
        <p>To lure more business people, the restaurant took aim at their weak spot and advertised a rich repast in one hour flat. Business has tripled, to an average 75 diners. They are able to sit down at noon and order, say, warm chili prawns with mango and cucumber relish followed by crisp-skin Tasmanian salmon with green-pea puree, tomato provencale and olive oil, all of it washed down with a good wine, and be out the door by 1. And if the Summit fails to deliver on the one-hour guarantee, customers win a one-night stay at a country resort.</p>
        <p>Other top-flight restaurants have begun speeding things up. Late last year, the highly regarded MG Garage restaurant put together a quick-lunch special for 25 Australian dollars, or $15. ''You can come here with a main course and a glass of wine already chosen to go with it, and that alone cuts the time of having to look at the menu and decide,'' said Janni Kyritsis, MG Garage's head chef.</p>
        <p>For years, American business people have eschewed wine at weekday lunches. In Australia, the trend is newer, but growing. ''If you go out for a boozy lunch, you write your whole afternoon off,'' said Leigh Anderson, a manager at Morgan &amp; Banks, an executive recruitment firm here. ''People can't afford to do that.''</p>
        <p>Not that Mr. Anderson is a stranger to the long lunch. He said that at the company he worked for six years ago in London it ''was almost a condition of your employment to take people out for lunch.''</p>
        <p>And they could be fairly liquid affairs, he confessed. Now, at Morgan &amp; Banks, he said, ''we tend to discourage that.''</p>
        <p>Harland Koops, a partner at the law firm of Henry Davis York, has also weaned himself of long lunches, though he says he was never a regular player on the lunch circuit. ''Calvinistic instincts seem to be reasserting themselves,'' Mr. Koops said.</p>
        <p>Clients, he added, ''really have their heads down making money, and they're not playing as much as they used to.''</p>
        <p>Ah, the good old days, Australian business people claimed a leisurely lunch of several courses and accompanying wines, followed by dessert and coffee, as a national privilege.</p>
        <p>Until late last year, even the bond market closed for a respectable hour and a half -- one of only a handful in the world to cease business in the middle of the day. Throughout the 1980's and into the early 90's, that shutdown created the occasional phenomenon known as the claret run. ''That's when a market would go on a seemingly inexplicable rally,'' one money market dealer explained. ''And it was based on the fact that a few people would come back from lunch all liquored up and decide they liked the market and start buying it.''</p>
        <p>Sometimes, they would not come back at all, and the business lunch would slide into dinner. Such epicureans were known as F.T.R.'s, for ''failed to return.''</p>
        <p>So what happened? What drove Aussies toward midday temperance?</p>
        <p>Time-poor, cholesterol-rich executives cite not just the global economy and the competitive pressures it has unleashed, but also fitness concerns. An increasing number are heading out for a lunch-hour jog or a session with a personal trainer. Or else they are eating at their desks so they can leave early for some surfing or golf.</p>
        <p>There was also the government's elimination of tax-deductible lunches in two stages -- the first in the 1980's, the second in the mid-1990's. Tony Bilson, director of the chic Ampersand Restaurant, called that change a ''body blow.'' It was followed by a new 10 percent tax on restaurant meals, that began on July 1, presaging even harder times to come. The trade at midday is so thin on some days that Mr. Bilson occasionally mulls shutting Ampersand for lunch.</p>
        <p>The same gastronomic drama has been playing itself in other parts of the world, notably France, where long, liquid lunches were for years a sacred ritual. No more. Listen to Capucine Favet, 26, a designer of street events for W.M., an outdoor-event company in Paris. ''Everyone goes out to the boulangerie, and comes back with bread, or cheese or something, and eats together as a group,'' Ms. Favet says.</p>
        <p>The trend toward faster midday meals has been long in the making in France, but got a fresh nudge in January with a law that bans salaried employees from putting in more than 35 hours a week. In response, many companies have stopped counting lunch hours in the figure, said Patrick Lenain, an economist with the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris. ''Now people who take two or three hours are executives, and it's business lunches with clients,'' Mr. Lenain said.</p>
        <p>In Australia, though, all the changes put together are not likely to deter die-hard diners. ''I work with a fellow who's known as Sir Lunch a Lot,'' Mr. Koops said. ''They're still out there, mate. They're just lunching on.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, at 3:30 on a recent afternoon, Mr. Koops's colleague could not be reached at his office. He was, his secretary said, still at lunch.</p>
