        <p>David Duval, the world's No. 3-ranked player, withdrew from the P.G.A. Championship today because of back pain that has plagued him since July.

        <p>''He and I were talking a little bit on the airplane coming back from the British Open, and David said, 'If this wasn't a major championship, there is no way I would've played,' '' Tiger Woods said.

        <p>David Duval, the world's No. 3-ranked player, withdrew from the P.G.A. Championship today because of back pain that has plagued him since July. Duval played in pain at the British Open, and he was forced to withdraw from the International two weeks ago. It is uncertain if Duval would play at next week's World Golf Championship NEC Invitational in Akron, Ohio.</p>
        <p>''He and I were talking a little bit on the airplane coming back from the British Open, and David said, 'If this wasn't a major championship, there is no way I would've played,' '' Tiger Woods said. ''His back was pretty sore, and it was bothering him quite a bit when we were playing. The telecast showed how gingerly he bent over to tee up his shots. I never saw him bend over to pick up grass.</p>
        <p>''Hopefully, his back will get better. I really don't know what is wrong with it. I feel bad for him because he is a good guy. He is one of my friends. I just hope he gets better.''</p>
        <p>Craig Stadler replaced Duval in the field. Bobby Nichols, the 1964 P.G.A. champion, also withdrew today with a hip injury. He was replaced by Greg Kraft.</p>
        <p>Norman on the Mend</p>
        <p>After missing the British Open because of hip surgery seven weeks ago, Greg Norman has made a swift recovery and finished fourth at the International earlier this month, showing he had fully recovered. At 45, Norman is playing without pain for the first time this year, and he believes he can contend.</p>
        <p>''It's good to be excited about playing golf again,'' said Norman, a two-time British Open winner, and a two-time runner-up at the P.G.A. ''I like my chances of playing well this week. Forty-five is just a number for me. My body tells me I'm probably 10 years younger. How I'm going to feel when I'm 48, 49, I don't know. But right now, I feel like I can definitely compete.''</p>
        <p>Westwood Has Game</p>
        <p>Lee Westwood has been one of the world's best players this year, winning four times since May on the European Tour. Many feel that Westwood, at age 27, has the game to win a major, and Westwood does not disagree.</p>
        <p>''I certainly feel if I sat down at the end of my career, if there wasn't a major, there would be something missing,'' Westwood said. ''In 50 years, nobody remembers who finished second in majors. I'd like to say I had won a major when I finish, and it doesn't really matter which one. I'd like to say I had won a few. But one would be a good start.''</p>
