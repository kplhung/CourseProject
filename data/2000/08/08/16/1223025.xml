        <p>The night had gone so poorly for Todd Zeile that he was receiving mock cheers from the Shea Stadium crowd for catching a routine ground ball. The cheers quickly became sincere.</p>
        <p>Zeile was responsible for helping the Rockies tie the second game of last night's doubleheader; his fielding error put the tying run on base in the seventh inning.</p>
        <p>Then, Zeile had his revenge. He hit a long fly ball that carried over the left-field wall for a go-ahead solo homer in the bottom of the eighth inning. After watching the first game's go-ahead run score in front of him, Zeile helped the Mets sweep the doubleheader.</p>
        <p>The homer gave the Mets a 4-3 lead they held on to. That followed a 7-5 victory in the opener -- Armando Benitez saved both games -- and continued the Mets' amazing run. In improving to 71-48, they have won 18 of their last 22 games and have not lost consecutive games since July 20 and 21. They are two games behind Atlanta in the National League East.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't often happen that you get a chance to have some redemption,'' Zeile said. ''There was nobody in the ballpark that wanted it more than I did.''</p>
        <p>Zeile made sure of that. From a personal standpoint, he had a forgettable day entering the bottom of the eighth inning. He had several failures in the first game, including a strikeout with the bases loaded, and allowed the Rockies to tie the score in the second game when he made an error on Todd Hollandsworth's ground ball to first base to lead off the seventh. Hollandsworth scored when Zeile fielded a sharp grounder but had no play at home. Fans did not forget when he later made a routine grab.</p>
        <p>''People got on him in the field and he came back big with the bat,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said. ''That's what he's done all year.''</p>
        <p>So, in the bottom of the eighth, Zeile golfed the reliever Bobby Chouinard's 3-2 pitch for a towering drive down the left-field line. Hollandsworth, Colorado's left fielder, approached the wall and leapt only to see it barely clear for a solo homer.</p>
        <p>The Mets starter Bobby J. Jones defended Zeile's fielding and said seeing a teammate redeem himself was one of the best parts of the game.</p>
        <p>''When he does that, it's a good feeling for him and for me,'' Jones said.</p>
        <p>Jones (8-5) continued his renaissance since agreeing to go to the minor leagues in June. He allowed three runs, two earned, in eight powerful innings last night. Jones gave up only four hits and one walk and improved to 7-2 since rejoining the Mets in June.</p>
        <p>The first game was a textbook example of the Mets' play over the last three weeks. They wasted an early bases-loaded, no-outs opportunity before rallying and setting the tone for the night.</p>
        <p>The Mets had the bases loaded with nobody out in the fourth inning. Twice, they had batters work counts of three balls and no strikes. Both batters struck out, and the Mets eventually failed to score in the inning. Zeile was the first of those strikeouts.</p>
        <p>''Some teams say, 'That was our chance, we muffed it and we'll get 'em tomorrow,' '' Valentine said. ''This team says, 'That was our chance, we'll get 'em the next inning.' ''</p>
        <p>The Mets may make their share of mistakes, but they can overcome them and capitalize on other teams' transgressions. They won the first game with a fill-in starting pitcher and without their best hitter, catcher Mike Piazza, who rested and caught the second game. And they won despite a multitude of mistakes, from wasted opportunities to base-running blunders.</p>
        <p>''We have a good enough foundation that things like that aren't going to crack the foundation,'' Valentine said. ''There aren't innings or plays that are going to keep this team from giving its best. There are teams that are going to outplay us, and that happens.''</p>
        <p>The Mets' fourth-inning flop in the opener began optimistically enough. Derek Bell and Edgardo Alfonzo led off with walks and Robin Ventura singled to right to load the bases. But Rockies starter Pedro Astacio turned stingy. He fell behind Zeile by 3-0 before striking him out on three straight pitches. Jay Payton followed the same course, flailing at Astacio's fastball for the final strike. And Mike Bordick lined a 1-2 pitch to shortstop Neifi Perez to end the inning to loud boos from the afternoon crowd.</p>
        <p>Pat Mahomes pitched into the seventh inning in his first start since May 13. He allowed four runs, three earned, in six and two-thirds innings. It was his longest start since 1995, when he pitched for the Twins.</p>
        <p>Mahomes did more than pitch. He successfully laid down a sacrifice bunt and stopped a sharp grounder with his bare hand.</p>
        <p>Zeile complemented his fourth-inning failure by being thrown out trying for a double leading off the sixth. Zeile even let the Rockies score a ninth-inning run off Benitez when he misplayed a grounder.</p>
        <p>The Mets entered the bottom of the seventh trailing, 4-2, but gave Zeile the perfect vantage point for the turning point. After the Mets put runners on first and third with no outs off Astacio, reliever Craig House walked Darryl Hamilton on four pitches to load the bases. Bell struck out before Alfonzo drew a full-count walk to force in a run.</p>
        <p>Mike Myers, a side-arming left-hander, replaced House and walked Ventura on a 3-2 pitch that sailed outside. Harris trotted home with the tying run.</p>
        <p>Zeile then watched Jose Jimenez's 2-2 pitch bounce in front of the plate, off the chest protector of catcher Brent Mayne and down the first-base line. Darryl Hamilton broke off third base and scored with a headfirst slide when Mayne's throw from foul territory bounced off Jimenez's glove. Zeile walked and Payton's groundout scored Alfonzo.</p>
