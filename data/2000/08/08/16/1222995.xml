        <p>For devotees of convention tradition, one quadrennial thing to watch for is the much anticipated, rarely provided, never announced and hardly ever spontaneous ''surprise visit'' by a candidate to the arena.</p>
        <p>Bill Clinton did it at his first convention in 1992, walking with his wife and daughter, Chelsea, from their hotel to Madison Square Garden in New York City. The delegates, who were about the only people not clued in to a surprise tipped well in advance to the television networks, went wild.</p>
        <p>There are other examples in convention lore. And the trick is always to do it a tiny bit differently. Tonight, the Democratic vice presidential-nominee-to-be, Senator Joe Lieberman, added his own wrinkle.</p>
        <p>Like a prizefighter wading through the ringside ticketholders, Mr. Lieberman waded onto the convention floor with a covey of jittery Secret Service agents. Photographers mobbed him. Delegates rose to their feet. Democrats gave him high-fives and called out ''Joe! Joe! Joe!''</p>
