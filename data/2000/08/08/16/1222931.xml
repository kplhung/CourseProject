        <p>Interim Principal Appointed at Bronx Science</p>
        <p>First-day jitters at the Bronx High School of Science next month may be shared by the principal as well. WILLIAM STARK, the prestigious school's assistant principal for organization, has been appointed interim principal, filling in for  STANLEY BLUMENSTEIN, who officially retires from his post in January but has already gone on leave to use up his accumulated sick days.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blumenstein, a 1963 graduate of the school who was named principal in 1995, will begin a new job as a principal at the Hebrew Academy of the Five Towns, on Long Island.</p>
        <p>2% Tuition Rebate at Richard Stockton College</p>
        <p>VERA KING FARRIS, president of Richard Stockton College, prides herself on running the most affordable state college in New Jersey. So it was with no small pain that she announced last spring that the college, in Pomona near Atlantic City, would raise tuition by 9.8 percent -- about double the national average increase for public colleges and universities. College officials said it was the only way to pay for rising enrollments, but vowed to continue lobbying for more state money. If the college got public money, Dr. Farris promised, students would get a rebate.</p>
        <p>When $1 million arrived from the state in July, Dr. Farris kept her word. The college will announce today that each student will receive a 2 percent rebate in the spring term. ''When I said that last spring,'' Dr. Farris said yesterday, ''I meant every penny of it.''</p>
        <p>Exhibition of Civil Rights Campaigners</p>
        <p>With the help of Community Works, a nonprofit educational organization, 200 New York City sixth, seventh and eighth graders from the Computer School on Manhattan's West Side have created an exhibition of photographs of and writings by 16 civil rights campaigners of the 1960's, including BOB MOSES, CAROLYN GOODMAN and the Rev. WYATT TEE WALKER.</p>
        <p>The exhibition, ''The Long Walk to Freedom: Portraits of Civil Rights Activists Then and Now,'' is on display at Aaron Davis Hall at City College in Harlem and will tour the five boroughs over a year. The students interviewed the campaigners during a two-year study of the civil rights movement and wrote poems about them that are included in the exhibition.</p>
