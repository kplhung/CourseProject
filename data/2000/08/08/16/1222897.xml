        <p>''Look at me!''</p>
        <p>The words, echoing what every performer on a stage asks on one level or another, are sung with particularly sweet self-satisfaction by the three title characters of ''The Witches of Eastwick,'' the splashy, hard-working new West End musical, in the show's concluding anthem.</p>
        <p>Since these are creatures who have already hovered perilously over the audience in midair -- rather like the falling chandelier in that earlier gothic musical ''The Phantom of the Opera'' -- it seems unwise to ignore their request for attention. If ''The Witches of Eastwick,'' which has few substantial thoughts in its head, has a moral, it is that you should never underestimate the power of being female, 40-ish and sexually ripe.</p>
        <p>That would seem to be the lesson of London theater in general this summer, with midlife resurrections translating into big box office and widely varied degrees of artistic success. On the stage, at least, women rule, and not the fantastical, mannered Mames and Dollys who have traditionally governed musicals.</p>
        <p>Cameron Mackintosh, the spectacle-loving producer of ''Witches,'' wasn't out of his mind when he chose a trio of questing middle-aged heroines as a humanizing addition to his signature series of identifiable flying objects, heirs to the chandelier in ''Phantom'' and the helicopter in ''Miss Saigon.''</p>
        <p>After all, the holdover musical smash from last season, the endearingly clunky ''Mamma Mia!,'' features an amateur trio of female singers who reunite 20 years after their salad days to perform the disco-era hits of Abba, the Swedish pop group. The stoutest of them now has difficulty falling to her knees in rock 'n' roll fervor as she once did. But that doesn't mean she can't court a fellow with all-out sexual aggressiveness in the showstopping ''Take a Chance on Me.''</p>
        <p>The robust British veteran Barbara Dickson (''Blood Brothers'') copped the 1999 Olivier Award for best actress as the life-scarred but enduringly lusty heroine of ''Spend Spend Spend,'' a purely British slice of tough sentimentality based on the good-luck/hard-luck story of the lottery winner Vivian Nicholson.</p>
        <p>And the most coveted ticket in London still belongs to ''The Graduate.'' The popularity of this cardboard adaptation of Mike Nichols's 1967 film would seem to rest almost entirely on a 20-second display of full frontal nudity by the play's jaded seductress, Mrs. Robinson, after dropping a bath towel. Replicas of the towel, please note, can be purchased for about $40 in the theater lobby.</p>
        <p>The role, first essayed by Kathleen Turner with a commanding deadpan languor that edged into camp, was recently taken over by the ex-model (and ex-wife of Mick Jagger) Jerry Hall, with the attendant press coverage threatening to eclipse that of that really older woman, the Queen Mother, on her centennial.</p>
        <p>In the meantime the glorious Helen Mirren, a stage and screen siren in her 50's who somehow looked well seasoned even in first youth, has turned a more somber analysis of an older woman involved with a younger man, Tennessee Williams's ''Orpheus Descending,'' into a must-see production at the Donmar Warehouse.</p>
        <p>Theater, unlike film, has traditionally been hospitable to women well past their ingenue years. And musicals in particular remain a sort of Never Never Land where actresses are as unlikely to grow old as Peter Pan, the eternal boy portrayed by Mary Martin when she was in her 40's.</p>
        <p>What's happening in London, however, is a firm departure from Martin's doing Peter or the aging Katherine Cornell as Juliet. John Dempsey and Dana P. Rowe, the lyricist and composer, respectively, for ''The Witches of Eastwick,'' dwell at length in their program notes on their attempts to make their heroines ''women in the truest sense'' in ways they ''generally aren't in musicals these days.''</p>
        <p>Or as Ms. Hall's hairdresser confided to The Evening Standard, ''Nowadays it's not about looking younger; it's about looking as good as possible for yourself.'' It seems apt that the most glamorous photographic image to be found in London subway cars these days is the honey blonde who gazes confidently from an advertisement for a menopausal vitamin supplement. And in one of several editorial essays occasioned by Ms. Hall's appearance in ''The Graduate,'' the novelist Fay Weldon, writing in The Daily Mail, suggested that harsh criticism of the actress might stem from today's young people ''feeling threatened by the new 'older women' '' and their ''general refusal to lie down and grow old gracefully.''</p>
        <p>That the stuff of theater is also the stuff of newspaper debates and subway ads testifies to the abidingly vital dialogue here between the stage and the broader national culture. It is an exchange that New Yorkers -- whose Broadway theater tends to have the immediate relevance of the medieval rooms of the Metropolitan Museum -- can only envy.</p>
        <p>This is true even as the West End, at the height of both the silly season and the tourist-courting season, takes on an American accent to match that of much of its audience, with no fewer than four major shows -- ''Witches,'' ''The Graduate,'' Tennessee Williams's ''Baby Doll'' and the recently departed ''Singin' in the Rain'' -- adapted from Hollywood movies.</p>
        <p>Clearly the London theater is not unswayed by vulgar commercial calculation. (Think of those Mrs. Robinson towels.) The current apotheosis of the older woman surely has something to do with that favorite science of marketers, demographics, and an awareness that baby boom audience members, with their children growing up and their expendable income expanding, are worth catering to. This is also the summer in which BBC television is devoting 10 weeks to celebrating the 1970's.</p>
        <p>Such systematic nostalgia was anticipated by the hugely successful ''Mamma Mia!,'' which opened last year under the astutely naive-seeming direction of Phyllida Lloyd. The show taps into affection for the disco era with a blithe ingenuity that thoroughly shames the leaden stage version of ''Saturday Night Fever.'' ''Mamma Mia!,'' the story of a single mother and the grown-up, soon-to-be-married daughter who wants to discover just who her father is, breezily mines this generation gap in sexual attitudes while cramming in 22 songs first performed by Abba.</p>
        <p>The overall effect is of a group of jolly tourists in a karaoke bar, a feeling compounded by the show's setting, a taverna on a Greek island. The audience inevitably loosens up in this holiday atmosphere, and when its three middle-aged leading ladies show up in full Abba regalia to perform ''Dancin' Queen,'' it seems as if everyone, on stage and off, is happily drunk.</p>
        <p>Another trio of harmonizing female friends of roughly the same age is at the center of ''Witches,'' Mr. Mackintosh's bid to secure his slipping crown as the world's pre-eminent producer of musicals. Here he de-emphasizes the technological spectacle of his glory years, presenting instead a character-driven show that deliberately recalls American musicals of the late 1950's and early 60's, like ''Damn Yankees'' and ''Bye Bye Birdie.''</p>
        <p>As staged by Eric Schaeffer, the show still hasn't settled on a convincing, consistent tone. Both the moody comic darkness of John Updike's novel and the opulent silliness of the movie it inspired have been more or less jettisoned. The approach instead veers between straightforward, sometimes sour satire of small-town small-mindedness (accented by the set designer Bob Crowley's acidic evocations of a Norman Rockwell world) and stirring hymns to feminist self-empowerment.</p>
        <p>The satire is old hat and not terribly funny, trying to trade on affection for a vanished American idyll even as it sends it up. Nor is Ian McShane, making his musical debut, the ideal choice for the devil who brings out the woman in each of the witches, a part played on screen by Jack Nicholson with his trademark mixture of loutishness and sly, suave charm. Mr. McShane, best known here as television's antiques-savvy detective, Lovejoy, expertly conveys the loutishness but not the charm, making the women who fall for him look desperate indeed.</p>
        <p>The show's true magic is generated by the witches themselves, played by Lucie Arnaz, Maria Friedman and Joanna Riding, and Mr. Dempsey and Mr. Rowe find their original voice when they are writing for them. Ms. Friedman's Sukie, who has a delightful, self-defining tongue twister of a number about being tongue-tied, emerges as the evening's most complete creation.</p>
        <p>The other two are undeniably appealing, though, with Ms. Arnaz's easy, earthy sensuality, and Ms. Riding giving appetizing bite to the cliche of the prim woman who takes off her glasses and becomes a sexpot. They are all at their strongest in their numbers together, deftly proving the show's rather labored point that sisterhood can indeed be powerful.</p>
        <p>The cartoon vision of Americans as shrill bigots and grubby materialists, so dear to the hearts of the English, is on pointed display in ''The Graduate,'' ''The Witches of Eastwick'' and to a lesser extent in the popular import from the Birmingham Repertory Theater, ''Baby Doll.''</p>
        <p>Lucy Bailey's stage adaption of the 1956 movie turns Williams's tale of a slow-witted child bride of the South (Charlotte Emmerson, with a crawling drawl) and the vengeful Italian immigrant (Jonathan Cake) who seduces her into a steam-heated sermon in intolerance. Willliams's Southerners have never seemed so grossly feebleminded, while Mr. Cake's crafty Sicilian is a gleaming paragon of wit and virtue.</p>
        <p>On the other hand there is the occasional London production of an American play that gets everything so right that you feel slightly embarrassed by memories of recent versions of the same work back home. Most conspicuously there is Howard Davies's lacerating production of ''All My Sons'' at the Royal National Theater, which brings an emotional tension to Arthur Miller's postwar morality tale that reduces many of those watching it to sobs. Julie Walters and James Hazeldine lead a high-powered cast that conveys every painful ounce of the toll exacted by a life-warping deception.</p>
        <p>Then there is Nicholas Hytner's refreshingly restrained take on ''Orpheus Descending,'' a work memorably rediscovered just over a decade ago here in Peter Hall's production with Vanessa Redgrave. As Lady Torrance, the love-mangled Italian shopkeeper in a Mississippi town, Ms. Mirren doesn't attempt to top Ms. Redgrave's all-out operatic grandeur.</p>
        <p>Instead she creates a meticulously layered portrait in which a wary bitterness conceals a wellspring of hopeful sensuality, just as the character's Italian inflections keeps slipping through the imposed Southern accent. The delicacy of this lady's gradual blossoming sets the tone for an exceptionally intimate ''Orpheus'' that emphasizes existential loneliness rather than erotic tragedy as the work's central theme, the sense of people sentenced to ''solitary confinement inside our own skins for life.''</p>
        <p>Those words come from the problematic hero of ''Orpheus,'' that virile guitar-strumming poet of the flesh, Val Xavier. Williams originally wanted Marlon Brando to play Val (he finally did in the movie version), and every actor who has tried the role has been measured against that unmatchable image. In this version the part belongs to Stuart Townsend, a lissome, faintly androgynous young man and not an obvious choice.</p>
        <p>But when you watch this Val responding to the women, you're aware of how intensely he focuses on them, as though no one else existed, and how sexy that can be. Few things make a person flourish more than the undivided attention of others. It is perhaps simply being in the spotlight for a change that makes those witches of Eastwick fly.</p>
