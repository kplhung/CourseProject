        <p>Ivax, a drug company that has fought for years to sell a generic version of Taxol, the top cancer drug in the United States, said yesterday that a little-known company had received a patent related to the drug, which could keep Ivax's lower-cost drug off the market for as long as two and a half years.</p>
        <p>Ivax executives had expected to gain approval from the Food and Drug Administration this summer to sell a generic version of Taxol, which is one of Bristol-Myers Squibb's top-selling drugs. That would have been welcome news for patients using Taxol.</p>
        <p>Ivax officials said Bristol-Myers had created ''another scheme'' to delay the introduction of a generic Taxol. Bristol-Myers has signed an agreement with the small drug company, American Bioscience of Santa Monica, Calif., that gives Bristol-Myers an option to obtain a license to any drugs sold under the new patent.</p>
        <p>Bristol-Myers sold $1.5 billion of Taxol last year, but its exclusive patent on the medication has expired. The company has been fighting Ivax and other generic drug makers in court since 1997.</p>
        <p>Federal law gives drug companies 20 years to market exclusively a drug that they discover or obtain a patent on. The 20-year period begins as soon as the application for a patent is filed.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for Bristol-Myers denied Ivax's claim that her company was engaged in a ''scheme'' to keep the generic drug off the market. She said the company was forced to list the new patent in a register published by the F.D.A. after American Bioscience sued Bristol-Myers in United States District Court in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>A lawyer for American Bioscience called Ivax's assertion ''ridiculous.'' ''We're asserting our legitimate patent rights,'' said the lawyer, Joseph F. Coyne of Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>But Neil Flanzraich, president of Ivax, said that the timing of the lawsuit and Bristol-Myers' option to license American Bioscience's drugs made Ivax executives think the two companies were working together to keep the generic version of Taxol off the market.</p>
        <p>''We're outraged that they have again come out with a scheme to delay us,'' Mr. Flanzraich said. ''Brand-name companies play these tricks. It is not fair. This kind of game-playing is not in the public interest.''</p>
        <p>Now that the new patent is listed in the F.D.A.'s register, Ivax must certify that it is not infringing on it. Once Ivax files that certification, under federal law, American Bioscience has 45 days to sue Ivax and contend the reverse -- that the new patent is being infringed. If American Bioscience sues, regulations require the F.D.A. to delay approval of the generic Taxol for 30 months, unless Ivax can prove in federal court that it has not infringed on the new patent.</p>
        <p>American Bioscience is a private company that was founded by Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong. News reports from China said that the China Development Industrial Bank invested $6 million in American Bioscience in May and that the company had a joint venture with the Industrial Technology Research Institute in Taiwan.</p>
        <p>Shares of Ivax fell $12.625, to $29.375, yesterday. Bristol-Myers shares rose $1.875, to $52.50.</p>
