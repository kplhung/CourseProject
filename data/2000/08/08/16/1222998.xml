        <p>Sony said yesterday that it would use computer memory chips made by the Transmeta Corporation of Santa Clara, Calif., in one of its popular models of laptop computers. Sony is a major customer of Intel, the dominant maker of computer memory chips. But it said it would equip the CI model of its Vaio line of laptops with Transmeta's central processing units, which offer more effective power saving. Sony said the chip was a good fit for the Vaio CI, since it is designed as a go-anywhere computer with a built-in video camera.</p>
