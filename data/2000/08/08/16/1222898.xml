        <p>It seemed like old times at the Tanglewood Music Center's annual Festival of Contemporary Music, which ended its five-day run on Monday evening. After several years of pointedly broadening the festival's palette to include everything from Minimalism -- music that was long unwelcome here -- to recent cross-cultural trends, like last summer's focus on Asian-American composers, this year's festival is devoted mostly to new music's old guard.</p>
        <p>That's not to say that the programming was stylistically monolithic. All told, more than 50 works were performed by the center's students and faculty in eight concerts at Seiji Ozawa Hall, with the Boston Symphony adding to the total in two related programs. Included were works by Chen Yi, Louis Andriessen and Morton Feldman that alluded to the innovations of the recent past. There were also a few works by Aaron Copland, that most user-friendly of America's modernists, in honor of his centenary.</p>

        <p>It seemed like old times at the Tanglewood Music Center's annual Festival of Contemporary Music, which ended its five-day run on Monday evening. After several years of pointedly broadening the festival's palette to include everything from Minimalism -- music that was long unwelcome here -- to recent cross-cultural trends, like last summer's focus on Asian-American composers, this year's festival is devoted mostly to new music's old guard.</p>
        <p>That's not to say that the programming was stylistically monolithic. All told, more than 50 works were performed by the center's students and faculty in eight concerts at Seiji Ozawa Hall, with the Boston Symphony adding to the total in two related programs. Included were works by Chen Yi, Louis Andriessen and Morton Feldman that alluded to the innovations of the recent past. There were also a few works by Aaron Copland, that most user-friendly of America's modernists, in honor of his centenary.</p>
        <p>Still, Elliott Carter, looking fit and energetic at 91, was the festival's composer in residence, and his vocal, chamber and orchestral works were scattered through the programs. Milton Babbitt was on hand to hear three of his works, including his 1964 ''Philomel,'' a classic for voice and tape. George Perle, the most innately lyrical of the Serialists, was represented as well.</p>
        <p>So were Charles Wuorinen, Pierre Boulez, Gunther Schuller, Luciano Berio, Luigi Dallapiccola and Oliver Knussen, each of whom has explored the melodically angular, harmonically dense post-tonal style in his own way. And the British composer and conductor George Benjamin, who at 40 is among the style's younger standard-bearers, was the festival director.</p>
        <p>This glance backward proved refreshing in unexpected ways. Serialism and its offshoots have taken it on the chin lately, as young composers have re-embraced tonality mixed with elements of popular music and as audiences and critics have celebrated this development, stopping long enough only to blame the Serialists -- not entirely without reason -- for scaring away listeners over the last 50 years. Yet here were students in their 20's arguing by way of polished, viscerally charged performances that reports of the old school's demise may be premature.</p>
        <p>There were some genuine surprises. Mr. Boulez, once the most fearsomely doctrinaire of Europe's postwar composers, was represented by ''Sur Incises'' (1996-98), a rhythmically vital, hard-driven work for harps, percussion and pianos, conducted by Mr. Benjamin on Sunday evening. It is entirely uncharacteristic of Mr. Boulez: for one thing, it is eclectic, touching on everything from Bartok to Steve Reich. And how many of Mr. Boulez's works can be described as rollicking, as this one most definitely is?</p>
        <p>Mr. Babbitt and Mr. Carter have softened the edges of their music during the last decade as well.</p>
        <p>In his ''Four Cavalier Songs'' (1991), Mr. Babbitt set a group of amorous 17th-century texts to melodies that mirror the cadences and flavor of the poetry, leaving his accustomed spikiness to the accompanying guitar part. Mr. Carter, in his ''Tempo e Tempi'' (1999) -- one of several works performed with distinction by the soprano Lucy Shelton -- supports an attractively chromatic vocal line with instrumental writing that has an otherworldly shimmer. And beneath the dense surface of his ''Allegro Scorrevole,'' which closed the festival, Mr. Carter's two main strands of counterpoint (one in the winds, the other in the strings) are both lucid and propulsive.</p>
        <p>Surprising in a different way was how fresh -- and, in some cases, accessible -- the more venerable works on the program sounded. The Boston Symphony, conducted by Robert Spano, gave an account of Mr. Carter's ''Variations for Orchestra'' (1955) that was so focused, lushly textured and energized that it received a standing ovation from an audience lured to the Koussevitzky Music Shed for a Sunday afternoon concert otherwise devoted to Mozart and Prokofiev.</p>
        <p>Mr. Babbitt's ''Philomel,'' performed by Ms. Shelton on Friday, was as emotionally searing as ever. And Lukas Foss's ''Paradigm,'' a quasi-improvisatory period piece from 1968 performed on Saturday, was as much fun to hear again as a Monkees album from the same time.</p>
        <p>A mixed pleasure, but a valuable experience, was the opening-night traversal of Mr. Berio's 14 ''Sequenzas.'' It is difficult to hear the full set -- three and a half hours of music --  in one sitting without their musical ideas beginning to blur. But the individual performances were strong and committed, and some proved particularly memorable -- among them, the works for trumpet (played by Gary Few), guitar (Eliot Fisk), flute (Elizabeth Ostling) and accordion (Joseph Petric), as well as the dizzily dramatic settings for voice (Ms. Shelton) and trombone (R. Douglas Wright).</p>
        <p>Other highlights included ''Tre Laudi'' (1937), an early, sublimely lyrical work by Dallapiccola, sung sweetly by Janna Baty, and ''Le Temps et l'Ecume'' (1989), a colorfully scored and almost Dali-like evocation of distorted time by the French composer Gerard Grisey, conducted by Mr. Benjamin, both on Friday afternoon. Two of Mr. Benjamin's works, ''Viola, Viola'' (1997), a duel-like viola duet, and ''Palimpsest'' (2000) for orchestra, showed the degree to which he has developed the ear for texture and color that drew attention to his earliest works.</p>
        <p>In some of the works, texture and color were almost everything. Oliver Schneller's ''Phantom Islands'' and Tristan Murail's ''Allegories'' in particular used those elements to create the impression of compressing and distending time without actually moving through it. Nothing much happens in these chamber pieces, yet their constantly shifting coloration exerted a hypnotic pull. Stefan Asbury conducted them and several other works in the festival with a sure hand.</p>
