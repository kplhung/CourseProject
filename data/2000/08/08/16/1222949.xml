        <p>After 12 years, Ted Buczek has learned not to get too hopeful about seeing Pablo Almonte Lluberes stand trial in the slaying of Mr. Buczek's son, a New York City police officer who was shot during a chaotic  chase on a dark street in Washington Heights.</p>
        <p>After all, American authorities have repeatedly asked that Mr. Almonte, who fled to his native Dominican Republic after the killing, be returned to New York to face murder charges. But year after year, Mr. Buczek said, he has watched with mounting frustration as Dominican authorities did little to capture Mr. Almonte, who at one point lived a life of relative ease as a baker in San Pedro de Macoris.</p>

        <p>After 12 years, Ted Buczek has learned not to get too hopeful about seeing Pablo Almonte Lluberes stand trial in the slaying of Mr. Buczek's son, a New York City police officer who was shot during a chaotic  chase on a dark street in Washington Heights.</p>
        <p>After all, American authorities have repeatedly asked that Mr. Almonte, who fled to his native Dominican Republic after the killing, be returned to New York to face murder charges. But year after year, Mr. Buczek said, he has watched with mounting frustration as Dominican authorities did little to capture Mr. Almonte, who at one point lived a life of relative ease as a baker in San Pedro de Macoris.</p>
        <p>But now, Mr. Buczek and the New York investigators tracking Officer Michael J. Buczek's killer are more hopeful than ever that Mr. Almonte -- considered by some American officials to be the No. 1 fugitive in the Dominican Republic -- will soon face American justice.</p>
        <p>Today, a new president, Hipolito Mejia, is taking power in the Dominican Republic, and his administration has indicated that it will work with United States officials to capture fugitives sought by American prosecutors. The top law enforcement official in the Dominican Republic, General Prosecutor Virgilio Bello Rosa, said in an interview that he met last week with officials at the United States Embassy to discuss extradition issues. He also said that an arrest order for Mr. Almonte was issued months ago, and that Dominican officials would pursue him.</p>
        <p>''I told them that the Dominican government will not allow the territory of the Dominican Republic to become a haven to international criminals, no matter what their nationality,'' said Mr. Bello Rosa, recounting his discussion with officials in the embassy.</p>
        <p>Law enforcement officials said that for years Dominican criminals -- many of whom committed crimes in New York as Washington Heights became the center of the Northeast crack trade -- escaped punishment by seeking refuge in their homeland. Although the United States has had an extradition treaty with the Dominican Republic since 1910, a law adopted by the Dominican legislature in 1969 blocked the extradition of Dominican citizens.</p>
        <p>Responding to pressure from American officials, President Leonel Fernandez signed legislation in 1998 allowing for the extradition of Dominican citizens, and 16 fugitives have been extradited to the United States since, according to the Justice Department.</p>
        <p>But other fugitives sought by police departments in the United States, officials said, have remained at large in the Dominican Republic, notably Mr. Almonte. And extradition remains controversial, leading to bitter political infighting over  highly publicized cases.</p>
        <p>Although it is unclear how many formal extradition requests have been filed, a Justice Department spokeswoman said American officials are interested in 84 fugitives in the Dominican Republic.</p>
        <p>But there are signs that Mr. Almonte's days of freedom may end soon.</p>
        <p>Representative Benjamin Gilman, a Republican from Middletown, N.Y., who heads the powerful House International Relations Committee, on July 6 blocked plans to give a naval ship valued at $3 million to the Dominican Republic until Mr. Almonte was handed over. On June 20, Mr. Gilman met with Mr. Mejia in Washington to express American interest in the return of fugitives.</p>
        <p>''His promise was that the first order of business as president would be to end the impunity in his country,'' Mr. Gilman said yesterday. ''I raised the Buczek case with him, and I told him that there was no better way to start doing something than by arresting and extraditing Pablo Almonte Lluberes.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gilman's tactics seemed to have worked in an earlier case. In February, he held up $6 million in aid until Dominican authorities cooperated in the search for Carlos Grullon Castro, who was wanted in the 1991 murder of his wife in Tarrytown, N.Y. At the end of July, after Dominican authorities cooperated with American officials, Mr. Grullon was found in Panama and sent to New York to face murder charges.</p>
        <p>The Grullon and Almonte cases have received heavy media coverage in the Dominican Republic, and American officials say the threat of the loss of aid has made an impression on Dominican authorities.</p>
        <p>That has Mr. Buczek, who lost his wife, Josephine, to cancer in July, more optimistic than ever about seeing Mr. Almonte face justice.</p>
        <p>''I'm very hopeful, more hopeful than ever,'' said Mr. Buczek, 74, who reared three children in Wayne Township, N.J., and now lives in Florida, where he keeps several pictures of his late son on a wall. ''At least now they're talking. Some people are making gestures. We just have to keep up the pressure.''</p>
        <p>Michael Buczek, 24, an officer in the 34th Precinct who had distinguished himself as hard-charging and resourceful in three years on the force, died on Oct. 18, 1988, when he and his partner crossed paths with two men who were leaving 580 West 161st Street. The officers thought the men looked suspicious -- the police later said they had been part of a team that robbed drug dealers in the building -- and ordered them to stop. The men ran.</p>
        <p>In the frantic moments that followed, Officer Buczek caught Mr. Almonte, the police said. ''He grabbed him, and Pablo wrestled out of my son's arms,'' recounted Mr. Buczek, who knows every detail of his son's death. ''He was wearing an open jacket, it wasn't zipped up and he got out.''</p>
        <p>A moment later, Mr. Almonte's companion, Daniel Mirambeaux, fired shots, hitting Mr. Buczek once in the chest and killing him.</p>
        <p>In June 1989, Mr. Mirambeaux, who had fled to his native Dominican Republic, was arrested and died under mysterious circumstances in the custody of the police, soon after being told that he would be extradited. Mr. Almonte, meanwhile, remained at large, though American officials repeatedly asked that he be found and arrested.</p>
        <p>Several obstacles, however, posed problems. For one, Mr. Gilman and the New York investigators who have been tracking Mr. Almonte say they believe that he has been shielded from capture because his brother  Raul Almonte Lluberes is a top official in the national police.</p>
        <p>Pablo Almonte was not indicted until 1998, when investigators in New York obtained new information from another man who had played a role in the robbery that preceded Officer Buczek's killing.</p>
        <p>After the indictment, American officials were able to file a more detailed dossier, as requested by the Dominican government, tying Mr. Almonte to the crime, said Jerry Giorgio, a senior investigator with the Manhattan district attorney's office who has worked on the case for years with Detective Anthony Imperato of the 34th Precinct. Coupled with the change in governments, the new request for Mr. Almonte may be paying off, said investigators in New York who have been in contact with the United States Embassy in Santo Domingo.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giorgio said he had been told that the authorities were seeking Mr. Almonte.</p>
        <p>Mr. Buczek, meanwhile, said that while the pain of losing his son remains sharp, the good memories he has of raising him and watching him become a dedicated police officer have helped him move forward. It has also helped that Officer Buczek's name lives on in Washington Heights, where a school and a playground are named after him.</p>
        <p>''The city lost a good servant; I lost a son,'' Mr. Buczek said. ''I do know that he will never be forgotten, particularly in Washington Heights. No, he won't.''</p>
