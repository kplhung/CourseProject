      <block class="full_text">
        <p>YOU'RE starting tomorrow,'' someone said to Pat Mahomes Monday in the Mets' clubhouse.</p>
        <p>''I don't know about that,'' replied the pitcher.</p>
        <p>''Valentine said so.''</p>
        <p>''He did? I gotta go in and ask him about it.''</p>
        <p>Earlier, Bobby Valentine, the Mets' manager, had also said something else about Mahomes. ''He's one of our hidden secrets,'' Valentine offered.</p>
        <p>Mahomes is such a secret, apparently, that there are times when even he doesn't know about it.</p>
        <p>Well, yes, there had been rumors but, in the best tradition of cloak-and-dagger, the mystery took time unraveling. In the end, Mahomes started.</p>
        <p>It was only Mahomes's fourth start this season in this, his second year with the Mets.</p>
        <p>''You can't be a good team without someone like Pat Mahomes doing his job and doing it well,'' Valentine had said. ''His contributions are at times overlooked. He doesn't have a defined role. We only turn to him when we're in need.''</p>
        <p>Last night was one of those times. Mahomes has generally come out of the bullpen in long relief, in short relief and everything in-between. If the nachos or knishes vendor called in sick, it wouldn't be a surprise for heads to turn to Mahomes for help. So the Mets had been riding a hot streak. Now a doubleheader with the Colorado Rockies came up because of a previous rainout and someone was needed to step in.</p>
        <p>Bobby J. Jones, a veteran starter, was to pitch one of the two games, the second. Who's to pitch the other? Well, the vendors were all present and accounted for, which freed up Mahomes.</p>
        <p>Not only has Valentine turned to Mahomes only when necessary, but, added the manager, ''He's done exactly what we needed.'' In Mahomes's three previous starts this season -- his last was May 13 -- his record was 0-0, but his earned run average was a superb 2.76. His record as a reliever is 4-1, good but not quite as good as last season when it was perfect, 8-0.</p>
        <p>When starting help was needed this season, the Mets called up Class AAA pitchers. They were treated harshly by opposing hitters. Now, Valentine looked not again to Norfolk but to the corner of his clubhouse where Mahomes, the 6-foot-4-inch right-hander from Tyler, Tex., sat.</p>
        <p>''Sure, most guys like a definite role,'' said Mahomes, ''and for most of my career I was a starter, but I'm thrilled to be with the Mets, with a contender, and in the big leagues, period. And I like Bobby. When I look him in the eye, I know what he's saying. I feel his trust in crucial situations.''</p>
        <p>Mahomes, who turned 30 last week, has been around, usually on the big-league fringes. He came up with the Twins in 1992 and was sent down to the minors, came up, and was down and up and down again. He was traded to the Red Sox and the story was similar. In 1997 and 1998 he pitched in Japan. The Mets gave him another shot. Called up from Norfolk in early 1999, he was terrific.</p>
        <p>And yesterday the hidden secret was only partly revealed. Mahomes pitched six and two-thirds innings, gave up five hits and left the game with the Mets behind, 4-2. If it had not been for a pair of run-involving doubles by Todd Helton, who was suffering with a .394 batting average entering the game, Mahomes would have fared even better. But Mahomes did keep the Mets in the ball game, which is as much as Valentine could have wished. And in the seventh, they came back with four runs to take a 6-4 lead, en route to a 7-5 victory.</p>
        <p>Mahomes also distinguished himself with the bat and the glove. He laid down a lovely sacrifice bunt that led to the Mets' first run. And he caught a hard bouncer with his bare hand to force a runner at second. If a team is going to win, it also needs such professional executions.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Mahomes had spoken of visions of postseason play. He said he remembered vividly the disappointment of the Mets losing in the playoffs last year.</p>
        <p>''I watched the World Series from home, and thinking: 'We're not scared of the Yankees. We can beat 'em,' '' he said. ''Nothing this season has made me change my opinion. We can get there. We've improved ourselves in a few positions, like starting pitcher. Guys like Robin Ventura and Darryl Hamilton are healthy again, and our bullpen is rested. Going down to the wire is going to be exciting.''</p>
        <p>When Dennis Cook relieved Mahomes in the seventh, the fans gave him a handsome round of applause. For them, it was as sweet as having found a shiny prize in their Cracker Jack box.</p>
