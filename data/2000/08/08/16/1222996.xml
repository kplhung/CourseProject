        <p>Tonight, the lobbying firm Patton Boggs was host for a cocktail hour and supper buffet at the Sunset Room in Hollywood. That was not much of a surprise: the chairman of the firm, Thomas H. Boggs Jr., is the son of the legendary Democratic Congressional leader Hale Boggs of Louisiana.</p>
        <p>But two weeks ago, at the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, Patton Boggs also had a very visible presence -- a dozen partners and associates, all recently hired Republican lobbyists. The firm was host for two lavish receptions in Philadelphia, including a party honoring the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee.</p>
        <p>Many of the same lobbyists who helped underwrite the Republican convention are out in force in Los Angeles. With close races anticipated for the White House and control of the House of Representatives, the brigades from Washington's K Street, the corridor filled with lobbyists and lawyers, are being more careful than ever to cover both party bases with their largess.</p>
        <p>The schedules of the lobbyists at both conventions represent a trend toward ''pragmatic political donors'' who aggressively court both parties to ensure that they will have access and influence, no matter who wins in November. The urgency of the strategy has grown this election year, as lobbyists confront the possibility that new parties will take control of the White House and Congress.</p>
        <p>Democratic firms first hurried to hire well-connected Republicans shortly after Republicans won control of Congress in 1994. This year, lobbyists say the city's largest firms are working hard to have a large presence at both conventions.</p>
        <p>''There is clearly an advantage when approaching possible clients to have a political bookend to my Democratic affiliations,'' said Lanny J. Davis, a Patton Boggs partner and former special counsel to President Clinton. Mr. Davis said recently that a new client was pleased that he and a Republican colleague -- Benjamin L. Ginsberg, a lawyer at the firm and the counsel to the campaign of Gov. George W. Bush -- would work together on a legislative issue.</p>
        <p>Patton Boggs has company among powerhouse lobbying firms who have invested heavily in both national conventions. Two other predominantly Democratic lobbying and law firms are also sponsoring receptions here, as they did in Philadelphia. One is  Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &amp; Feld, host for a brunch today at the Beverly Hills Hotel in honor of Robert Strauss, the firm's founder and a former Democratic Party chairman.</p>
        <p>The other is Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson &amp; Hand, which was among the hosts for a late-night party today for the Democratic National Committee at the Sky Bar of the Mondrian Hotel in West Hollywood. Two weeks ago in Philadelphia, the firm sponsored a tribute to former Senator Bob Dole and Elizabeth Dole. Mr. Dole, the 1996 Republican presidential nominee, is special counsel at Verner, Liipfert.</p>
        <p>The firm's roster of senior partners includes the former senators Lloyd M. Bentsen and George J. Mitchell and the former governors James J. Blanchard of Michigan and Ann W. Richards of Texas, all Democrats; and the Republicans Daniel R. Coats, a former senator, and Leonard Garment, who was counsel to President Richard M. Nixon.</p>
        <p>At the Beverly Hills Hotel, a who's who of the Democratic establishment turned out for a brunch of bagels and fresh fruit in honor of Mr. Strauss, who built both the Democratic Party and Akin, Gump into financial powerhouses. In attendance were Senator Tom Daschle, the minority leader; Senator John Edwards of North Carolina; Donald Fowler, a former Democratic National Committee chairman; and  Mickey Kantor, the former commerce secretary.</p>
        <p>In Philadelphia, a squad of Republican lawyers and lobbyists that Akin, Gump hired in the last few years was co-sponsor with some of its clients for receptions.</p>
        <p>David Geanacopoulos, a lobbyist in the Washington office of Akin, Gump, said the bipartisan effort was a growing trend at most big firms. ''Clients want to know that you have both Democrats and Republicans who can help them,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Partners and associates at the three lobbying firms have increased their political giving to Republicans in this election cycle, which began in January 1999. The political action committee for Akin, Gump has given 54 percent of its $296,000 in donations to Republicans. Verner Liipfert's political action committee gave 55 percent of its $161,000 in donations to Democrats. Patton Boggs does not have a political action committee, but its members have made $390,000 in campaign contributions this election cycle, 63 percent to Democrats, 36 percent to Republicans.</p>
        <p>Republican lobbyists are also bulking up their Democratic credentials. The United States Chamber of Commerce reflects the trend toward ambidextrous convention entertaining. In 1996, the group sent its top officials to the Republican convention in San Diego; it did not participate in that year's Democratic gathering in Chicago. This year, however, the chamber has sponsored parties at both conventions.</p>
        <p>Not all Washington lobbying firms are becoming bipartisan. Some are fiercely partisan, like Barbour Griffith &amp; Rogers, a Republican firm whose leaders brag that they do not give a single dollar to a Democrat.</p>
        <p>''It works for us,'' said Ed Rogers, a partner at the firm. ''We have made the conscious decision to be that way and make a virtue out of it. When we are on the hill or dealing with an elected official, we want them to know there is not someone down the hall from us committed to removing them from office.''</p>
