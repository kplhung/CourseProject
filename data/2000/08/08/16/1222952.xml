        <p>John Caffrey had been teaching English for 31 years when he heard about a new way to gain recognition for his skills, one available to teachers nationwide. The hitch: applicants had to pass a rigorous and time-consuming assessment that included videos of their teaching, samples of their students' work and essays analyzing their classroom techniques.</p>
        <p>Mr. Caffrey, who was teaching middle school in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, was not the type to mind the extra work. He already had two master's degrees and was eager for another credential, even if it did not mean  higher pay or career advancement.</p>
        <p>''I simply wanted to be recognized as an expert in my field,'' Mr. Caffrey said last week. ''I wanted the confidence that affirmation like that could bring.''</p>
        <p>So in 1995, Mr. Caffrey became one of the first New York City teachers to earn advanced certification from the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, an independent panel that sets standards for experienced teachers. The board, created in 1987, was recommended in a landmark report, ''A Nation Prepared: Teachers for the 21st Century,'' by the Carnegie Forum on Education and the Economy. National board certification does not replace state certification, which remains an entry level requirement for all teachers. Instead, it helps teachers with at least three years of experience measure their skills using benchmarks set by the panel, which is mostly made up of teachers but also includes school administrators, union officials, lawmakers and business leaders.</p>
        <p>''It recognizes people who go beyond what is expected,'' said Karen Zumwalt, a professor at Columbia Teachers College, ''and it motivates people who want to grow professionally but aren't sure how to do it.''</p>
        <p>Last year, a record 2,967 teachers earned national board certification, bringing the total to 4,804 nationwide since 1995. But only 62 teachers in New York State have earned the credential, and of those, only 25 work in New York City. Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers, said the program has been slow to catch on here because there were few financial incentives attached and because city teachers were overextended as it is.</p>
        <p>But as education has become a crucial election issue and states have scrambled to attract teachers in the face of a shortage, New York has joined several dozen other states in creating incentives for teachers to get national certification. The state now pays the $2,300 application fee for most teachers. And starting this year, the state plans to give $10,000 a year for three years to teachers who earn the advanced certification and agree to work in low-performing schools. In New York City, that means the 99 ''schools under registration review,'' which have been designated by the state as failing.</p>
        <p>City teachers who earn national certification also can get a $3,700 raise. But those with 30 credits beyond master's degrees -- about 44 percent of the city's teachers -- have already received that increase and cannot get more. Ms. Weingarten said this lack of an additional incentive was the main reason so few city teachers have gone through the process.</p>
        <p>The new incentives may be working. This spring, 100 teachers in New York State submitted applications to the national board, up from 59 in 1999. Those teachers will find out in November whether they passed the assessment. Meanwhile, about 50 city teachers are applying for national certification in the coming school year, up from 20 this spring. Typically, slightly more than half of each year's applicants are certified .</p>
        <p>During the school year, applicants videotape their classroom instruction, submit lesson plans and student work samples, and write essays reflecting on how they help students learn. They also have to write extensively about their work outside the classroom with colleagues, parents and the community. In the summer, they finish the process with written exams on the subject they teach, as well as teaching techniques.</p>
        <p>''It takes up all the extra time that you possibly have,'' said Beverly Tinort, who teaches first grade at C.S. 21 in Brooklyn and earned national board certification last year. ''But it's so worth it. Teachers in New York are so burdened, we never get a chance to stop and reflect on how we're doing our job. This is a blessing because it forces us to stop and reflect.''</p>
        <p>As part of the assessment, Ms. Tinort had to sit with colleagues and watch a video she had made of herself teaching sixth graders. Her colleagues picked apart everything from her body language to why girls seemed more engaged in the lesson than boys.</p>
        <p>''Early on it was very painful to watch yourself with that critical eye,'' Ms. Tinort said. ''But you pick up so many things that you never would have realized.''</p>
        <p>She said, ''You really pick up on your weaknesses.''</p>
        <p>Others, like Mr. Caffrey, said the national certification process did not improve their skills but simply affirmed that their teaching methods were on the mark.</p>
        <p>''When I go into classrooms now I have a sense of accomplishment,'' said Mr. Caffrey, who now runs a union-sponsored teacher training center in Brooklyn's District 14. ''I always felt teaching was a noble profession and I worked so hard every day, and it just didn't seem to me that people in the management system recognized that. Now I have some recognition.''</p>
        <p>Skeptics question whether nationally certified teachers are really better. Chester E. Finn Jr., an assistant secretary of education under President Reagan, said there was no data on how the students of these teachers performed compared with their peers.</p>
        <p>''After 10 years and gazillions of dollars and an awful lot of states being wooed to give bonuses to these folks, all we know is that other teachers admire their teaching,'' Mr. Finn said. ''I need to see some proof that these teachers are more effective in terms of student learning.''</p>
