        <p>The huge influx of money into biomedical research is creating unacceptable conflicts of interest for scientists and is eroding the public's trust in the data, scientists and officials said today at a government conference.</p>
        <p>The meeting was convened by the Department of Health and Human Services to consider strengthening guidelines on conflict of interest in medical research.</p>
        <p>Dr. Jane E. Henney, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said some researchers testing drugs or therapies have profitable arrangements with companies financing the research, raising the question of whether the data is unbiased. Citing the death of a patient in a gene-therapy experiment last year, Dr. Henney warned that ''if a crisis in confidence develops, if research subjects no longer feel safe, then medical research will grind to a halt.''</p>
        <p>David Korn, a senior vice president at the Association of American Medical Colleges, warned that if medical researchers and professional associations did not establish guidelines on research involving human subjects, the federal government would do it for them.</p>
        <p>Dr. Korn said a decade ago, the government tried to impose rules on how and when scientists could accept money or stock while working on a  company's products. But researchers successfully lobbied against the proposal. Instead, there is a rule that suggests that if a scientist has such a conflict, it should be reported, confidentially, to the university.</p>
        <p>Now, he said, such disclosure was probably not enough to keep the public's confidence.</p>
        <p>Thomas S. Bodenheimer of the University of California at San Francisco and a contributor to The New England Journal of Medicine, said today that he had spent a year reviewing literature and interviewing researchers and drug officials.</p>
        <p>Dr. Bodenheimer said he found that when drug companies paid for a trial of a new drug, 89 percent of the time the studies found that the new drug was better than those it was replacing.</p>
        <p>But when tests were conducted by scientists not paid by the company, the new drug received good marks only 61 percent of the time.</p>
        <p>He said he also found that some articles published in medical journals were written not by the researchers who conducted the studies but by ghost writers at the companies whose drugs were being studied. In other cases, he said, well-known doctors were hired to be guest authors on studies they had not conducted.</p>
        <p>Dr. Bodenheimer cited a survey of six major medical journals in 1996 that found that of the 809 articles, 29 percent had guest authors, ghost authors or both. He said he concluded that ''biases can be, and have been, intentionally introduced that favor the company funding the study.''</p>
        <p>''How often this takes place we do not know,'' Dr. Bodenheimer said. ''The evidence I have shown makes a reasonable case that scientific misconduct does take place in clinical drug trials, that conflict of interest is a risk factor for scientific misconduct, and that something must be done about it.''</p>
