        <p>REMEMBER spiked watermelon, that simple summer cooler? You take a whole ripe watermelon, gouge a chunk out of the rind and upend a bottle of ice-cold vodka into it until the melon has absorbed all the liquor. Slice it and serve.</p>
        <p>Messy? Yes, and somewhat crude. But there's an immediate invigorating power in the spiked watermelon's marriage of late summer fruit and potent alcohol, not to mention a pleasant conundrum: Is it a drink? Is it fresh fruit?</p>
        <p>Now, at least one Manhattan chef has taken the idea to another level. Steven Picker of Good, in Greenwich Village, is steeping watermelon chunks in vodka, straining the infusion and serving it chilled, neat, in a martini glass. It packs every last drop of a spiked watermelon's unbuttoned essence into a sophisticated cocktail.</p>
        <p>And watermelon vodka is just the beginning. All over New York, chefs are bringing their expertise -- and some exotic ingredients -- to bear on the bar, funneling whole spices into bottles of rum, tossing peaches into pitchers of sake, packing leafy sprigs of summer herbs into tequila bottles, soaking sour cherries in cachaca.</p>
        <p>What they are demonstrating is that infusing spirits is as easy as punching a hole in a watermelon. Maybe even easier (uncap a bottle, add flavorings, shake and steep). And it's almost as fast. Most spirits will take on the flavor of anything added to the bottle in as little as 24 hours. These infused spirits can be drunk straight, or mixed into sprightly cocktails.</p>
        <p>Good's watermelon infusion takes on only the palest pink color from the melon along with its cucumber-like flavor. It's mixed in a house cocktail, with lemonade, bitters and Triple Sec, but the easygoing flavor is most refreshing chilled on its own.</p>
        <p>On West 42nd Street, Kazuto Matsusaka, the chef of Above, steeps fresh peaches, cantaloupe and raspberries in Kaori sake for two days in the refrigerator. The sunny note of each fruit allows the slightly grainy finish of the rice wine to show through. The infused sake is served in a glass pot, with an ice well to keep it cool. When decanted into tiny glass cups, the sakes look clear, but each pot contains a small amount of fruit as a garnish. Above also infuses vodka with ginger and hot peppers to serve alone or in cocktails.</p>
        <p>Roy's New York, in the financial district, makes infusions with both vodka and cachaca, the South American sugar cane liquor. Steeping cachaca for 24 hours with a pound and a half of pitted sour cherries rounds out some of its rough edges. It is then used with mint in a caipirinha, the sweet Brazilian cocktail. Vodka infused with mild purple basil leaves lends a lilt to martinis garnished with yellow heirloom tomatoes.</p>
        <p>Infusing spirits with herbs, fruit, nuts and grains is as old as tea brewing. Scandinavians have been taming their fiery aquavit with ingredients like caraway, lemon, aniseed and hyssop since at least the 15th century. And throughout Europe, brandies have traditionally been softened with infusions of fresh fruit to make sweeter, softer drinks that evoke summer all winter long.</p>
        <p>The market for commercial flavored vodkas and spiced rums may be partly responsible for the current interest in infusions. But restaurateurs and bar managers are eager to put a personalized stamp on their drinks.</p>
        <p>''We wanted to do something different,'' said Dan Perlman, the beverage director at AZ, in the Flatiron district. In the restaurant's first-floor lounge, three heavy glass kegs with stainless-steel spigots loom above the bar. One is a tawny Chinese five-spice rum, with cinnamon stick, cloves, Sichuan peppercorns, star anise and fennel seeds floating in it. A dozen Meyer lemons are curing in crystal clear vodka in another. And a third contains a rusty-tinted Seville-orange tequila. They're dry, razor-sharp infusions and will be served neat to anyone who asks. But the bar prefers to mix each infusion into house drinks like the peppery ''Dark &amp; Ztormy,'' a mix of the five-spice rum and ginger beer.</p>
        <p>At Dylan Prime in TriBeCa, vodka is infused with with fresh horseradish, celery seeds and whole black peppercorns. It is the foundation of what the bar calls a bloodless Mary, served in a martini glass garnished with a julienne of celery and rimmed with celery salt. The first evocative whiff is followed by a rush of sinus-clearing heat.</p>
        <p>A pint of boldly flavored fruit, like pineapple, raspberry, strawberry or peach, takes only a day to infuse a bottle of liquor or sake. More subtle flavors, like celery seed, melon, basil or blueberry, can take as long as two days. As a starting point, figure on one tablespoon of a dried spice for a 750-milliliter bottle of liquor.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, there are just a few guidelines. Don't sweeten an infusion during the steeping; you can always add simple syrup to the finished alcohol. And when making infusions with more than one fruit or spice, you may want to steep the ingredients individually, in smaller, separate bottles, and then blend them in varying amounts to reach the perfect balance of flavors. It's your drink, after all, so adjust it to suit your taste.</p>
        <p>HORSERADISH VODKA  Adapted from Dylan Prime  Time: about 15 minutes</p>
        <p>2 ounces fresh horseradish root  1 750-milliliter bottle of vodka  1 tablespoon celery seed  2 tablespoons black peppercorns.</p>
        <p>1. Peel horseradish, and cut into fine shreds with a vegetable peeler. Uncap vodka, pour off 1 cup and reserve. Using a funnel, add celery seeds and peppercorns to bottle. Add horseradish, then top off bottle with reserved vodka. Let stand at room temperature for 24 hours.</p>
        <p>2. Strain vodka through fine sieve to remove celery seeds and fine particles. Chill completely before serving.</p>
        <p>Yield: 700 milliliters.</p>
        <p>FIVE-SPICE RUM  Adapted from AZ  Time: 2 minutes, plus 48 hours for infusion</p>
        <p>1 750-milliliter bottle of dark rum  1 cinnamon stick  4 whole cloves  1 star anise</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon fennel seeds  Pinch Sichuan peppercorns.</p>
        <p>1. Uncap rum, and add spices. Replace cap and shake bottle well, then let stand at room temperature for 48 hours.</p>
        <p>2. Strain rum through a fine sieve, and discard spices. Serve in highball glasses straight up, chilled or on the rocks. (To make AZ's Dark and Ztormy cocktail, pour rum into highball glass and add a splash of ginger beer and a garnish with a wedge of lime.)</p>
        <p>Yield: 8 drinks.</p>
        <p>PEACH SAKE  Adapted from Above  Time: 10 minutes, plus 24 hours for infusion</p>
        <p>2 to 3 ripe peaches  1 liter sake, chilled.</p>
        <p>1. Cut peaches in half, and remove pits but not skins. Slice thin, and place in large Mason jar or pitcher. Pour sake over the peaches, cover and refrigerate 24 hours.</p>
        <p>2. Strain sake through cheesecloth into clean decanter, reserving peaches. Serve immediately, with 3 or 4 peach slices in each glass, or refrigerate sake and peaches in separate containers for later. Infused sake will keep 4 to 5 days in sealed bottle in refrigerator. Peaches will keep 3 days.</p>
        <p>Yield: 1 liter.</p>
        <p>BLOODLESS MARY  Adapted from Dylan Prime  Time: 5 minutes</p>
        <p>Celery salt  2 ounces horseradish-infused vodka, well chilled  1 celery stalk.</p>
        <p>Dip rim of a martini glass in water, then in celery salt to coat. Add chilled vodka. Garnish with celery cut into very fine julienne on a mandoline or with a vegetable peeler. Serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 1 cocktail.</p>
