        <p>In the end, the confrontation between young people and the police that took place in the parking lot outside the Democratic National Convention on Monday night came down to what it often comes down to: a standoff between police officers who want to go home and young people who don't want to go home.</p>
        <p>Many of the young people who don't want to go home -- a group of indeterminate size that mingled with the political or anarchistic groups outside the Democratic convention -- are a special kind of protest group in themselves. They don't have a formal organization, membership, posters or agenda. But they are everywhere these days, causing all kinds of problems, chiefly because they don't want to go home and they want to be entertained.</p>

        <p>In the end, the confrontation between young people and the police that took place in the parking lot outside the Democratic National Convention on Monday night came down to what it often comes down to: a standoff between police officers who want to go home and young people who don't want to go home.</p>
        <p>Many of the young people who don't want to go home -- a group of indeterminate size that mingled with the political or anarchistic groups outside the Democratic convention -- are a special kind of protest group in themselves. They don't have a formal organization, membership, posters or agenda. But they are everywhere these days, causing all kinds of problems, chiefly because they don't want to go home and they want to be entertained.</p>
        <p>They made headlines at Woodstock '99 in Rome, N.Y., last summer, when the festival ended unexpectedly early and the former Air Force base where it was held erupted in arson and vandalism. Pundits pointed the finger at factors from the heat to the high cost of bottled water to the lack of sanitation. But lurking behind it all was the restlessness of the young people who don't want to go home.</p>
        <p>In Los Angeles, the designated protest area where the politically inflammatory rock and rap band Rage Against the Machine was setting up for a free concert on Monday felt a lot like Woodstock '99. Before the music started, excitable rock fans were moshing and body-surfing. When the music stopped at 7:24 p.m. after a 40-minute set, the audience simply turned its attention to another stage: the fence separating the protest area from two rows of police officers in riot gear and, behind them, the convention itself.</p>
        <p>Soon at least a dozen in the crowd -- from bored rock fans to self-proclaimed anarchists -- were lobbing glass bottles, smoke bombs and even a No Parking sign at the police. Eventually the police moved in with rubber bullets and pepper spray.</p>
        <p>For Mike Bigge, a 23-year-old Los Angeles resident, the show had just begun when objects started flying. ''I came for a good time, and now I'm having one,'' he said as mounted police forced panicked protesters and rock fans out of the parking lot.</p>
        <p>Among those initially throwing projectiles was a teenager in a black T-shirt who declined to give his name for fear of arrest. He lighted a firecracker and threw it over the fence. Why? ''Why not?'' he said.</p>
        <p>Was there anything in particular he was protesting? ''No,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Many of those interviewed before, during and after the confrontation harbored not a single political thought. ''I don't really have an opinion on the convention,'' said Alberto Freire, a 13-year-old Rage fan from Torrance, Calif., before the disturbance began.</p>
        <p>There were as many video and still cameras held in the air during the Rage show as protest posters. Several camera-carrying fans who showed up for the concert said they were not there to convey a message to the Democratic Party but to gather content for their Internet sites.</p>
        <p>If the convention in the hall is mostly a political show for television, the message of the medium applies to controlling crowds as well: if you give the crowd something boring to watch, it eventually goes away. Firing rubber bullets, however, constitutes putting on a good show.</p>
        <p>After all, during the concert, attention turned to the police when the audience was bored between acts -- after Rage's performance and before the next group, a Latin jam band called Ozomatli. So it sought new entertainment by provoking the police.</p>
        <p>When Ozomatli started performing, the crowd at the fence started to drift over to the stage to see which show was more entertaining. But it was too late. During Ozomatli's second song, a police commander walked on stage and announced that the gathering had been declared unlawful and that the crowd had 15 minutes to disperse. People lingered.</p>
        <p>It was then that the police commander tried something ingenious: he told Ozomatli to make music and lead the crowd out of the parking lot Pied Piper-style, according to Bubba Cervantes, the band's security guard. Band members picked up drums and started playing. They began marching the group, comprising almost all of the several hundred protesters who remained, toward the north exit of the parking lot.</p>
        <p>But before they could reach the exit, as the 15-minute time limit was about to expire (the police said they waited 20 minutes), mayhem broke out. The police fired pepper spray, beanbags and rubber bullets, turning the march into a stampede.</p>
