        <p>He is the subject of much outrage and derision on the Internet; critics have called him a manipulative Machiavellian egomaniac; and he seems to be especially irritating to David Letterman, who has labeled him ''that naked fat guy.''</p>
        <p>But almost 30 million people are watching him on television every week: Richard Hatch is a star.</p>
        <p>''He's like Heather Locklear on 'Melrose Place,' '' said Lisa Miller-Katz, a casting director for numerous television series, but not this one. ''He's the villain that you love to hate. He's a casting dream.''</p>
        <p>Certainly the producer of ''Survivor,'' Mark Burnett, and CBS's casting executives had no way of knowing exactly what they were getting when they selected Mr. Hatch as one of the 16 original castaways on what was expected to be a kind of summer curiosity. About all they knew was that he was a ''corporate trainer'' from Newport, R.I., with a lot of self-confidence.</p>
        <p>But now ''Survivor'' has become the most talked-about show in America, a certifiable cultural phenomenon that has set ratings records and recruited an entire new audience to CBS. And Richard Hatch is unquestionably one of the biggest reasons the show has worked so well.</p>
        <p>Within the first few weeks, Mr. Hatch set himself up as the center of the drama on the deserted island where ''Survivor'' takes place. He created an alliance -- and boasted about it on camera -- with three others who have consistently voted together to eliminate opponents as designated by Mr. Hatch, who seemed to pick his targets on the basis of who had the most potential to keep him from winning the $1 million prize that goes to the ultimate survivor.</p>
        <p>The alliance has proved so effective that every member of the original opposing tribe has been eliminated.</p>
        <p>''He was very well cast, and he has played his part really well,'' Ms. Miller-Katz said. ''If you can find a villain that makes people hiss, that's incredibly valuable. Without someone like Richard, I know I wouldn't be as rapt as I have been every week.''</p>
        <p>Not that she especially likes him. ''I think he's incredibly icky,'' Ms. Miller-Katz said, echoing the judgments of many other viewers who have rooted for Mr. Hatch to get his comeuppance and be eliminated by his fellow castaways. Certainly he made news by parading around the island naked on several occasions, images that were tastefully scrambled by CBS.</p>
        <p>Mr. Letterman has made him the target of almost nightly invective, at one point declaring that if ''the fat naked guy'' wins the contest, ''there's going to be rioting in the streets, there's going to be looting.''</p>
        <p>That hasn't prevented Mr. Hatch from being the most sought-after ''Survivor'' participant. How hot is he? CBS executives say they have received a flood of media requests for appearances by Mr. Hatch as soon as he is either voted off the island or wins the game, all of which will be determined on the show's final episodes, tonight and next Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Until then Mr. Hatch is unavailable for comment. CBS's policy is to forbid media appearances until a contestant's fate is sealed on the show. Colleen Haskell, a perky student from Miami ousted last week in Mr. Hatch's latest purge, was deluged with dozens of requests for interviews and offers for appearances.</p>
        <p>Previous ''Survivor'' losers have already found outlets. Jenna Lewis, a college student from New Hampshire, is mulling an offer to pose nude for Playboy. Stacey Stillman, a lawyer from San Francisco, and B. B. Andersen, a retired contractor from Kansas, have already filmed commercials for Reebok. Ramona Gray, a biochemist from Edison, N.J., is to be a judge at the Miss Teen U.S.A. Pageant on CBS on Aug. 26. Dirk Been, a substitute teacher from Wisconsin, was hired as a celebrity spokesman for a health-care remedy. And Gervase Peterson, a youth basketball coach from a Philadelphia suburb, has taped a guest appearance on the sitcom ''The Hugleys.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hatch has already been sought for appearances at colleges and state fairs. And this is before he has had the chance to go out and market himself, something he seems to have a talent for.</p>
        <p>Just where his skills might be best used is open to question. Ms. Miller-Katz said that the cast of CBS's other summer reality series, ''Big Brother,'' has turned out to be ''totally boring.'' So maybe his best immediate use for CBS might be as an interloper at that house.</p>
        <p>Now playing the part of George: Richard Hatch. If can make a hit of that one, he'll be able to name his own price.</p>
        <p>Big Prize at Big House</p>
        <p>If you like to watch 16 people trying to survive on an island, maybe you'll be up for 10 people trying to escape from a prison.</p>
        <p>ABC has bought the format rights to yet another British reality series, ''Jailbreak.'' The network seems excited at the prospect of this one, though it did not intend to announce that it owned the rights until after the series goes on the air on Channel 5 in Britain next month.</p>
        <p>Even though CBS has had the big success with reality shows this summer, ABC has been the most aggressive network in lining up the next generation of the genre, having already acquired ''The Mole'' (a group of people on a sort of scavenger hunt are sabotaged by one in their midst) and ''The Runner,'' (viewers across the country hunt for one contestant assigned to perform various tasks in secret).</p>
        <p>The sale of rights to ''Jailbreak'' -- like those to ''Survivor,'' ''Big Brother'' and ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' -- was negotiated by Ben Silverman of the William Morris Agency, who became an advocate of the reality genre during a four-year stay in England. ''I really love this one,'' he said. '' 'Jailbreak' has a chance to be really huge.''</p>
        <p>The show was created by two young British producers, Sebastian Scott and Henrietta Conrad, who own Princess Productions. Channel 5, which Mr. Silverman described as a ''Fox-like, young alternative network,'' built a prison equipped with cameras and the latest in electronic devices, like laser-beam alarms, which the contestants will have to thwart if they are to escape.</p>
        <p>Prize money (no specific amount yet) awaits the escapees. The group will be allowed to work in teams but then must share the money. If an individual gets out first, he gets it all.</p>
        <p>All the prisoners will be given clues on how to escape, Mr. Silverman said, and sometimes they can get a task accomplished only by working together.</p>
        <p>The show, which will run every night for weeks in Britain, is more likely to be a weekly series on ABC. It will also add some devilish touches, like having two guards -- one good, one bad -- who are identical twins.</p>
        <p>ABC executives declined to discuss the show or the deal. One reason: they want to get a look at how the format works in Britain first. Given the need to build the prison, it is likely that the show will take at least six months to get on the air.</p>
