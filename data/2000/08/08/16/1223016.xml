        <p>Banging on desks and stomping their feet, the students chant daily -- not just multiplication tables and state capitals but big thoughts, too: ''Knowledge is power, power is freedom, and I want it.'' Their teachers carry cell phones, on call for homework help at all hours. Parents sign contracts enumerating daunting demands -- if they slip up, their children can be punished.</p>
        <p>KIPP Academy, a pair of public middle schools in poor sections of Houston and the Bronx, requires 70 percent more class time than its counterparts -- including Saturday and summer sessions. Its black and Hispanic students consistently get top scores on standardized tests.</p>
        <p>As the national political debate focuses on the question of how to raise achievement among poor and minority children, KIPP, founded five years ago by a pair of young Ivy Leaguers, has drawn keen attention from left and right, idealistic do-gooders and entrepreneurial free-marketeers. Honored last year by the liberal Children's Defense Fund, the school was highlighted at last month's Republican National Convention, where its pupils were on stage, rapping, ''Read, baby, read.''</p>
        <p>Now, in an unprecedented effort to turn a boutique school success story into a national network, Donald G. and Doris Fisher, the founders of the Gap clothing chain -- who know something about building a franchise -- have given $15 million in seed money to create hundreds of KIPP clones across the country.</p>
        <p>''If you can replicate the success of KIPP at a bunch of places, and eventually on a scale that cannot be dismissed by lots of excuse-making,  do you end up forcing change on the larger system?'' asked Scott Hamilton, director of the new KIPP Foundation, which will train teachers to open charter schools in KIPP's image. ''Our hope is the answer is yes.''</p>
        <p>Successful schools for the poor have long been written off as wildflowers in the educational desert that dominates their neighborhoods -- mirages or miracles, but dubious prospects for portability. Their outstanding results were chalked up to the local context, support from private donors or the particular brilliance of a dynamic leader.</p>
        <p>The expansion of KIPP -- which stands for Knowledge Is Power Program -- is the most ambitious and intriguing of a host of new replication projects spawned by the growing practice of holding schools accountable for student achievement. Fueled by the freedom offered by charter schools, which receive public funds but are run independently, this trend could change the educational landscape from one defined by districts and states to one divided more by curriculum and style.</p>
        <p>Edison Schools, the for-profit company started by Christopher Whittle, will soon have 108 campuses in 21 states, each copying a detailed program. Whole-school reforms like Success for All, which sell packaged curriculums, have become a huge growth industry. There are also looser networks, like E. D. Hirsch's Core Knowledge schools and Theodore R. Sizer's Coalition of Essential Schools,'' linked by a broad set of educational values. And Teacher's College at Columbia University has joined with Replications Inc., to copy KIPP and other excellent schools in New York on a small scale.</p>
        <p>''We've got brand-name everything elses,'' observed Chester E. Finn Jr., an education analyst at the Manhattan Institute. ''Now we have Comer schools and Hirsch schools, and we're going to have KIPP schools and Edison schools -- you're going to be able to move into a new city and say, 'Show me the local Hirsch school.' That's not a bad idea for a modern mobile society.''</p>
        <p>KIPP's ambitious project is unique for its focus on school leadership, a concept that has grown in importance as education has become infused with business principles. The foundation's yearlong training began this summer for the first four KIPP fellows with an intensive six-week seminar at the University of California, Berkeley, business school. This fall, the fellows will immerse themselves in KIPP culture during eight-week ''residencies'' at each campus. By January, they will be ensconced in Atlanta, Houston, Washington, D.C., and rural North Carolina, working full-time to set up their schools, each scheduled to open with 75 fifth graders next year.</p>
        <p>In addition to creating hundreds of new schools -- the fellowship is slated to grow to 12 people next year, then 25, 50, 75, 100 and 150 -- the KIPP Foundation will search for existing schools that share its philosophy. To remain in the network -- which will offer financial support, technical assistance, help with teacher recruitments, camaraderie and annual $25,000 bonuses for high performance -- schools will be evaluated every four years.</p>
        <p>''What's intriguing about it is that they are focusing on issues of culture, the values and norms and beliefs about children's capacities to learn and adults' capacities to teach,'' said Richard F. Elmore, a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. ''That's where most of the so-called replication efforts fail.''</p>
        <p>KIPP grew out of a 12-hour conversation about the problems plaguing public education between Michael Feinberg and David Levin as they drove a Ford Taurus from Los Angeles to Houston in the summer of 1992, weeks after finishing the University of Pennsylvania and Yale University. They were new recruits of Teach for America, the national program that places college graduates in impoverished schools.</p>
        <p>Two years later, frustrated by the limitations of their classrooms but inspired by a Los Angeles teacher, Rafe Esquith, the pair convinced the Houston district to let them stretch class from 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. They recruited 50 fifth graders, printed T-shirts, and taped Mr. Esquith's motto, ''There are no shortcuts,'' over the door. The next year, the duo split: Mr. Levin returned home to New York to start a branch of the program there, and Mr. Feinberg expanded in Houston, recruiting three teachers to help him with the new crop of 72 fifth graders.</p>
        <p>Today, KIPP-New York outperforms all other Bronx middle schools on New York's standardized tests, and 98 percent of the students at KIPP-Houston pass all sections of Texas' state exams. Eighth-grade graduates have earned $5 million in scholarships to the nation's top private high schools over the past two years, and continue to earn good grades in their new schools.</p>
        <p>''Nothing these guys do, nothing that they do, is beyond the reach of every school in the country, period,'' said Samuel Casey Carter, who highlighted KIPP in a report on successful schools for the conservative Heritage Foundation, and is helping write a ''users' guide'' for the new network schools. ''This is not rocket science, this is very, very simple stuff, but it's monitored and it's managed and it's continually improved.''</p>
        <p>Both KIPP campuses are marked by militaristic discipline and rituals, children chanting ditties written by Mr. Levin's mentor, Harriett Ball, a Houston teacher. (''How do you make good grades? We bring our tools and follow the rules. It might sound square, but we're going somewhere.'') After more than nine hours in class, students get two hours of homework each night, which parents must sign.</p>
        <p>Students, teachers and parents all sign contracts pledging to do their best. In Houston, children who misbehave must wear their KIPP T-shirts inside out and speak only to teachers. In New York, missteps and plaudits are carefully chronicled on  faux weekly paychecks, which students can redeem at the school store.</p>
        <p>The KIPP network will not mandate that its members mimic this model. But every school must share the six ''pillars'': high expectations, enrollment by choice, a principal who controls the budget and hiring, an extended school day and year, rewards and consequences for student and staff achievement, and outstanding academic results. For now, the schools will not carry the KIPP name, a brand the founders are wary of watering down. (Mr. Feinberg, 31, is stepping down as director of the Houston school to become chief executive officer of the foundation; Mr. Levin, 30, remains principal in the Bronx and will serve as a consultant to the KIPP network.)</p>
        <p>''We want the smell of the place to be the same,'' said Mr. Feinberg, a mix of drill sergeant and Little League coach who stands 6-foot-4 and shaves his head. ''They'll look like cousins. They're not twins, but they're all related.''</p>
        <p>The rest is up to the school leaders.</p>
        <p>Though the foundation hopes to make its fellowship competitive and prestigious, this year's class was selected in a hurry, largely through word of mouth. Three of the fellows, like KIPP's founders, are Teach for America alumni. The fourth is Derrick Lockwood, a nondenominational minister and 15-year veteran of private and public schools in Atlanta, where Gov. Roy Barnes hopes to open as many as 10 KIPP academies. The fellows receive a $45,000 stipend, plus the Berkeley boot camp -- which cost $250,000 -- and a $1 million loan for school buildings.</p>
        <p>''It was, literally, an opportunity that fell out of the sky,'' said Caleb Dolan, 25, who plans to open his school in Gaston, N.C., a tiny town near the Virginia border where he has been teaching sixth grade since 1996. ''We came home from school one day and there was a message on the machine that said, 'Would you like to run a charter school?'</p>
        <p>''It's always been my pipe dream,'' Mr. Dolan added. ''It's been my late-night conversation for about three years now: If we ran the school, if we ran the school.''</p>
        <p>Soon, they will. But first, there are classes in instructional leadership, recruitment, accounting, negotiations, even media training.</p>
        <p>Seated around a classroom festooned with KIPP's signature aphorisms (''Work hard, be nice,'' ''Quality, not quantity is our measure''), the fellows click away at their laptops, plotting budgets, then role-play performance appraisals. Mr. Feinberg is on hand to share anecdotes from his own experiences, like how often to expect federal reimbursement for subsidized lunches.</p>
        <p>The other day, the fellows were creating ''accountability plans,'' breaking each part of their future schools' missions into specific goals with assessment measures attached.</p>
        <p>''Did you write all students, or just students?'' asked Daniel Caesar, 27, a KIPP teacher who hopes to open a second campus in Houston.</p>
        <p>''I just have 'students,' '' offered Susan Schaeffler, 30, who plans to run the school in Washington.</p>
        <p>''All,'' insisted Mr. Dolan, ''it has to be all.''</p>
        <p>Finlay McQuade, the instructor, pointed to the motto posted overhead.</p>
        <p>''It's all students will learn, not all students can learn,'' Mr. McQuade said. Then, he added, ''These are goals, not necessarily realities.''</p>
