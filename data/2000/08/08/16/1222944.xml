        <p>The unseeded 22-year-old had just lost in the first round of the GHI Bronx Tennis Classic, 6-2, 3-6, 6-4, to Peter Wessels from the Netherlands.

        <p>Martin Lee walked slowly out of the brick building that served double duty as a players' changing and shower room and the public bathroom. His face was reddened, from sickness and exhaustion, and flies buzzed around his head as he offered a slight smile.</p>
        <p>The unseeded 22-year-old had just lost in the first round of the GHI Bronx Tennis Classic, 6-2, 3-6, 6-4, to Peter Wessels from the Netherlands. Wessels is the tournament's top-seeded player and its highest-ranking participant at No. 93. Lee, 100 places lower in the rankings, was playing him with a fever after a night of throwing up and had a doubles match in front of him.</p>
        <p>There are 20 challenger events like the Bronx tournament for men, and 30 for women. This one attracts players ranging from Wessels to Mexico's Mariano Sanchez, ranked No. 914. The men's and women's clubhouses and the tournament office are trailers, and the players' lounge is a white plastic tent with two couches settled into the gravel-filled ground.</p>
        <p>Players, coaches and the scattering of fans wander the same grassy paths around the courts, eat in the same food court and huddle in the same places during rain delays. It is an intimate setting, eight courts nestled deep within the Bronx's Crotona Park, with the sounds of children's tennis lessons filtering through the air. For Lee, a Briton, and his doubles partner and friend, Jamie Delgado, it is a long way from Wimbledon, where they have played mainly as wild-card entrants the last three years. Lee is ranked 193rd in the world, while Delgado recently dropped from 160 to 229 as 1999 tournament victories became outdated.</p>
        <p>Lee and the 23-year-old Delgado understand the importance of these smaller tournaments, but the difference between Wimbledon and tennis's Class AAA equivalent are stark.</p>
        <p>''For us, Wimbledon is the biggest event in the world, obviously,'' said Delgado, who qualified last year and advanced to the second round. This year, as the wild card, he lost in the first round to Patrick Rafter. ''But I'm 100 percent committed to these tournaments, so I can play in the bigger ones.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday he won his first-round match when Michael Llodra strained his quadriceps while trailing and conceded the match. The handful of fans silently drifted away to other matches, and Delgado scooted unnoticed through to the next set of stands to watch Lee, who was playing the next court over.</p>
        <p>At Wimbledon, he said, the thousands of people that come every day give a special feeling to it. ''Everything's the best,'' he said. ''But we're not crying after its finished.''</p>
        <p>Lee said: ''In a way it's tough, but you've got to play these tournaments. Tennis is so tough these days. Getting to the top 100, it's slow. This is still a big opportunity.''</p>
        <p>It is, although many feel that Delgado should have progressed further by now. At 14, he won the Orange Bowl tournament for juniors, and by 15 he was defeating Tim Henman, England's best player. Surrounded by people confidently proclaiming his future success, Delgado began believing it, and then began to plummet. He fell to No. 469 in the world. Henman, steadily improving, floated up to the elite level.</p>
        <p>''I think everyone in the world would have done some things differently,'' Delgado said. ''It's in the past.'' But, he said, his lack of concentration and commitment lasted for months. ''Everyone was talking about it,'' he said. ''They were trying to make me realize the opportunity that I was wasting.''</p>
        <p>In 1997, England's Lawn Tennis Association withdrew his funding and stopped providing coaches. He understood it was time to change. So he did. Today, the man who cut off his funding is his personal coach, and Delgado is creeping back through the ranks with realistic top 100 aspirations.</p>
        <p>''He's a very talented boy,'' said Jeremy Bates, his coach and manager of men's national training for England. ''He knows that. He's been told that for 10 years. He needs to work really hard. He needs to live, eat, sleep and breathe whatever is going to make him a better player.''</p>
        <p>Delgado and Lee are both planning to compete in the qualifying rounds for the United States Open next week. If successful, they would be in the event for the first time.</p>
        <p>There are years ahead of them, but both have seen it almost slip away.</p>
        <p>''You have to get yourself animated,'' Delgado said, ''or it can pass you by really quick.''</p>
