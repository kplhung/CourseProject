        <p>FAUCHON, the legendary Parisian market, has made its debut in New York. Its first American shop opened Monday at 442 Park Avenue, at 56th Street, in the Drake Swissotel.</p>
        <p>For now, the glass display cases, shelves and free-standing consoles in the 3,600-square-foot store are stocked with pink and gold packages of fancy jams, chocolates, crackers, mustards, oils, vinegars, pickles, sauces and 109 kinds of tea. But there are no cheeses for the biscuits, baguettes for the jam or fancy produce for the oils and vinegars. These are not what Fauchon is planning to sell here.</p>

        <p>FAUCHON, the legendary Parisian market, has made its debut in New York. Its first American shop opened Monday at 442 Park Avenue, at 56th Street, in the Drake Swissotel.</p>
        <p>For now, the glass display cases, shelves and free-standing consoles in the 3,600-square-foot store are stocked with pink and gold packages of fancy jams, chocolates, crackers, mustards, oils, vinegars, pickles, sauces and 109 kinds of tea. But there are no cheeses for the biscuits, baguettes for the jam or fancy produce for the oils and vinegars. These are not what Fauchon is planning to sell here.</p>
        <p>The closest to substantial food in the New York store now are three kinds of quiche: classic Lorraine; Provencale, with tomatoes and zucchini; and crab meat, all on excellent flaky pastry, priced at $30 to $40 each, and also sold by the slice. Starting in the fall, the shop will carry other Gallic specialties, like duck and goose foie gras, truffled, in terrines, glittering with aspic or wrapped in pastry.</p>
        <p>Smoked salmon will be stocked, and so will Iranian caviar, now that the United States government has lifted the ban on it.</p>
        <p>Fauchon's chef de cuisine, Jean-Pierre Clement, is training the American staff to make the prepared food. Another chef from France, Xavier Mougica, will soon replace him.</p>
        <p>The candy counter is laden with chocolates, marrons glaces in four flavors, pates de fruit and marzipan creations. The jewel-like glace strawberries ($2 each) are not to be missed. Chocolate Eiffel Towers are $5 each. The pastry department is limited to delicious macaroons for the moment, and there are packaged cookies, and gradually other pastries, ice creams and sorbets will be added.</p>
        <p>It has taken Fauchon, which has 800 stores in 33 countries, this long to open in the United States because the company's emphasis was placed on establishing franchises in Europe, Asia and the Middle East. When Laurent Adamowicz bought the 114-year-old company in 1998, he set his sights on the American market. The $3 million New York store is company owned.</p>
        <p>On Monday, the tea salon at Fauchon will open, with a menu of little sandwiches and pastries. It will also serve a complete afternoon tea for $28 and an all-chocolate menu for $30. Like the store, it will be open every day from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., except Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day.</p>
