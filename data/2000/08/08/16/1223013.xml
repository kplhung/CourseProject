        <p>When school reopens in four weeks, there will be room for 13,686 new seats in new schools, new wings and leased classroom space, officials said yesterday.</p>

        <p>When school reopens in four weeks, there will be room for 13,686 new seats in new schools, new wings and leased classroom space, officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Five new schools are to open. Three of them, Intermediate School 230, Public School 212 and P.S. 161, will be in Queens, which has some of the most crowded districts in the city, with more than 268,000 students.</p>
        <p>Middle College Science and Technology High School is to open in Brooklyn and P.S. 6 on Staten Island.</p>
        <p>The schools, annexes and portable classrooms, which are being built by the School Construction Authority, will accommodate 10,574 students. Space for the 3,112 other seats will be provided by school board workers, who will use partitions and leased space.</p>
        <p>Enrollment in city schools could be the same or slightly higher than last year, when it grew by about 1,000 students. Between 1,000 and 3,000 new students are expected this fall, said Steven Sanders, chairman of the State Assembly's Education Committee, down from the growth in the early 1990's, when 15,000 to 20,000 students were added to the rolls each year.</p>
        <p>The slight growth last year relieved somewhat the overcrowding that had forced schools to teach children in hallways, closets and even bathrooms.</p>
        <p>Last year, the authority opened seven schools, mostly in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>But shifting immigration and mobility patterns have created a disproportionate amount of crowding in certain areas of the city. Besides Queens, Districts 10 and 11 in the Bronx and District 6 in Washington Heights, in Manhattan, are expanding far more than enrollment trends across the city.</p>
        <p>Terri Thomson, the Queens representative on the Board of Education, said that Queens was short 27,000 seats last year.</p>
        <p>The lack of space meant that 8,000 high school students had to take six classes instead of the state-mandated seven, she said. ''Enrollment is booming,'' Ms. Thomson said. ''The borough is in a crisis.''</p>
        <p>Assemblyman Ivan C. Lafayette, a Queens Democrat, said that two of the new schools, P.S. 212 and I.S. 230, were in part of his district, in Jackson Heights, a thriving residential immigrant community of Latin Americans.</p>
        <p>The schools will relieve crowding at four surrounding elementary schools.</p>
        <p>''I'm happy the new schools are opening,'' he said. ''But I'm not happy that we still need more seats. I would estimate that we need at least four more schools.''</p>
        <p>Oliver Koppell, a member of Community School Board District 10 in the Bronx, said that because of immigration patterns, the area continued to have problems with space even though four schools opened last year. He has worked closely with Irma Zardoya, the district's superintendent, to push Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to use part of the Kingsbridge Armory for public schools for lack of any other available space.</p>
        <p>''We have a lot of temporary classrooms in modular units,'' he said. ''Not only are they not the best environment for children, they are often placed in schoolyards. The kids don't have a place to play outside because the yards are taken up by the classrooms.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 18, 2000, Friday  An article on Wednesday about school construction in New York City referred incorrectly in some copies to a trend in enrollment. For the third year in a row, enrollment is growing more slowly than in the early 1990's. It has not been declining.</p>
