        <p>Still exulting in President Clinton's performance, delegates and party faithful celebrated on Monday night at the Latino Committee 2000's block party in downtown Los Angeles, featuring the queen of salsa, Celia Cruz.  The bash felt like a neighborly small-town festival, to the extent that an event brought to you by AT&amp;T, SBC Communications and Verizon -- to mention only the phone companies chipping in -- can manage to feel neighborly.</p>
        <p>Corporate America is wooing the Hispanic vote for the same reason Gov. George W. Bush has gone bilingual on the campaign trail. Indeed, if America were a corporation, Wall Street would be crying for a spinoff of its Hispanic subsidiary, its hottest growth prospect. Over the next 30 years, Hispanics, now 12 percent of the population of the United States, will account for 47 percent of its  growth, according to Census Bureau projections.</p>
        <p>''The Latino vote will be increasingly crucial,'' said Gloria Molina, chairwoman of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, ''and both parties will have to pay attention to Latino issues.'' But then Ms. Molina added a caveat that bedevils all political strategists seeking to capitalize on the demographic boomlet: ''Our issues are essentially all-American issues like education, housing and health care.''</p>
        <p>Gregory Rodriguez, a Los Angeles-based fellow with the New America Foundation, calls the Latino community in the United States ''the least ethnocentric group of voters.'' Polls consistently show, for instance, that immigration does not rank high among Hispanics' leading concerns. He also believes that the Latino community, which at 32 million is now larger than the population of Canada, is too heterogeneous to be counted on as a monolithic voting bloc.</p>
        <p>It encompasses Mexican immigrants in Los Angeles, Puerto Ricans in New York and Cubans in Miami.  Among the latter, Governor Bush leads Vice President Al Gore by more than 50 points in recent polls. Among all Hispanics, Governor Bush's convention in Philadelphia, a veritable diversity feast, cut the vice president's lead from 34 to 18 points.</p>
        <p>But while it is not easy to generalize about what Latinos as a whole stand for today, polls do point to some trends. Hispanics are more likely than the population as a whole to believe in an activist, compassionate government, and while their standard of living lags behind that of other demographic groups, they consistently have the most optimistic views about the future.</p>
        <p>Hispanics also tend to be more socially conservative, which is one more reason Democratic Party officials were incensed at Representative Loretta Sanchez's decision to play host at a fund-raiser at the Playboy mansion this week. Public Policy Institute of California surveys show that only 42 percent of the state's Hispanics favor an unrestricted right to abortion, compared with 67 percent of non-Hispanic whites. Separate surveys show that Hispanics favor school vouchers by a wide margin, and they were the staunchest supporters of California's Proposition 22, a pre-emptive strike against any move to recognize gay marriages.</p>
        <p>This makes the former Republican governor Pete Wilson's strident anti-immigrant rhetoric all the more baffling. Mr. Wilson won 44 percent of the Hispanic vote in 1990 before he and his party embarked on their suicidal mission of alienating Hispanics. In 1998, their share had dropped to 17 percent. ''We really miss Mr. Wilson,'' said Mary Rose Ortega, a hometown delegate and California director of the National Education Association, reveling at Monday's block party. ''I know many people who had previously not been involved in politics who became citizens simply to vote against the Republicans after Proposition 187,'' she said, referring to the California voter initiative that deprived illegal immigrants of public services. Like many Hispanics here, Ms. Ortega was most offended by the tone of the debate at the time, not the measure's specifics.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately for Democrats, however, they will face not Pete Wilson but George W. Bush in November. Governor Bush could not have adopted a more different tone than Governor Wilson towards his state's immigrant population. When he ran for re-election in 1998, his share of the Hispanic vote was more than twice as large as his party's share in California that year.</p>
        <p>This raises the question troubling Democratic Hispanic officeholders in Los Angeles: Will Mr. Bush be able to replicate this success nationwide?</p>
        <p>''I think so,'' said Mayor Carlos Ramirez of El Paso, in a telephone interview. Elected as a Democrat, Mayor Ramirez opted to miss out on all the fun in Los Angeles and instead go to Philadelphia to nominate Mr. Bush, whom he calls an ''inclusive, moral leader.'' He says the governor's education policies have proven especially beneficial to Hispanics. He also believes Democrats have fallen short on traditional family values that Hispanics hold dear, by going too far on issues like gay marriage.</p>
        <p>Ms. Molina, the Los Angeles County supervisor, concedes that if Mr. Gore's campaign does not make a passionate pitch to the Latino voter,  Mr. Bush could make serious inroads and win as much as 35 percent of the Latino vote in California. ''I think,'' she said, ''there is a real danger that the Democratic Party will take our vote for granted.''</p>
