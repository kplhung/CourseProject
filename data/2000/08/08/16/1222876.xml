        <p>LAMB with peaches sounds Middle Eastern, but I first came across the combination in a contemporary German cookbook. It is a logical pairing and tastes glorious, with the sweetness of the fruit cutting through the richness of the lamb. But the challenge lay in finding an efficient way to make it, since the original required two separate cooking methods, with a resting period in between.</p>
        <p>The easiest technique was to grill lamb chops and peaches side by side. Unfortunately, this yielded essentially lamb with peach relish, and I wanted the peaches to contribute their juices to the final product.</p>
        <p>So I developed a relatively fast and almost unattended braise. Most braises begin with browning, but this one ends with it, reducing both spattering and time: since the lamb's liquid is mostly cooked away at the end of the braising, it doesn't go flying from the hot fat, and the meat browns faster. And the peaches contribute some of their juices to the pan while browning lightly and turning tender.</p>
        <p>A hint of cinnamon gives the dish a great aroma as it cooks and a slightly mysterious flavor; I don't think you'd want more than that. An even smaller amount of allspice, maybe an eighth of a teaspoon, would also work. A pinch of cayenne or other red pepper makes a nice addition, and an onion cooked along with the meat provides just a little more complexity; you could live without it, but it doesn't take much effort.</p>
        <p>One issue remains unresolved, and that is whether to tilt the dish in a Middle Eastern or a European direction. The first calls for  finishing it with lime and cilantro, the second with lemon and parsley. I loved both.</p>
        <p>LAMB WITH PEACHES  Time: About 90 minutes, largely unattended</p>
        <p>2 pounds boned shoulder of lamb, trimmed of fat and gristle and cut into 1- to 1 1/2-inch pieces  Salt  1 cinnamon stick or 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon cayenne  1 medium to large onion, cut in half</p>
        <p>1/2 cup port, red wine or water  4 medium to large ripe peaches, washed  Juice of 1 lemon or 1 lime  1 cup roughly chopped parsley (for use with lemon) or cilantro (to go with lime).</p>
        <p>1. Place lamb in a 12-inch skillet, and turn  heat to medium-high. Season with salt, and add cinnamon, cayenne, onion and wine or water. Bring to a boil, cover and adjust heat so the mixture simmers steadily. Cook 1 to 1 1/2 hours, checking and stirring every 15 minutes or so, adding a little more liquid in the unlikely event that the mixture cooks dry. (This probably means the heat is too high; turn it down a bit.)</p>
        <p>2. When the meat feels tender when poked with a small sharp knife, remove the onion and cinnamon stick, then turn the heat to medium-high, and cook off any remaining liquid, allowing the lamb to brown a little. Cut the peaches in half and remove their pits, then cut each of them into 12 or 16 wedges. Stir in the peaches, and continue to cook, gently tossing or stirring the mixture, until the peaches are glazed and quite soft but still intact, about 5 minutes.</p>
        <p>3. Stir in the lemon or lime juice and most of the parsley or cilantro. Taste, and adjust seasoning. Garnish with what's left of your chosen herb, and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
