        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>President Clinton's ''farewell'' speech at the Democratic National Convention (front page, Aug. 15) resurrects the issue of whether our political system can find a way to take advantage of the experience and insights of former presidents.</p>
        <p>The question of trying to harness the counsel of former presidents struck me after Mr. Clinton's first inauguration in 1993, when there were five living former presidents, a situation that last happened when Lincoln assumed the presidency in 1861.</p>
        <p>Nearly a decade after leaving the White House, Harry S. Truman wrote a book called ''Mr. Citizen.'' In it, he proposed that legislation be enacted to allow former presidents to serve as ex officio members of Congress, with a right to participate in debates but not to vote or filibuster.</p>
        <p>This notion is perhaps quixotic. But it would be an enormous contribution to public discourse if all our former presidents had the right to participate formally in Congressional debates on the defining issues of the day.</p>
