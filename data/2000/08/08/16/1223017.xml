        <p>Invoking the themes that her father offered here 40 years ago this summer, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg stepped out of her guarded private life and onto the stage of the Democratic convention tonight to lend the family name to Al Gore's presidential campaign and to thank the nation for its support through what had been another difficult year for the Kennedys.</p>
        <p>''I thank all Americans for making me and John, and all of our family, a part of your families -- for reaching out and sustaining us through the good times, and the difficult ones, and for helping us dream my father's dream,'' Ms. Schlossberg said. ''As I look across this hall, and across this country, I know that my father's spirit lives on, and I thank all of you.''</p>

        <p>Invoking the themes that her father offered here 40 years ago this summer, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg stepped out of her guarded private life and onto the stage of the Democratic convention tonight to lend the family name to Al Gore's presidential campaign and to thank the nation for its support through what had been another difficult year for the Kennedys.</p>
        <p>''I thank all Americans for making me and John, and all of our family, a part of your families -- for reaching out and sustaining us through the good times, and the difficult ones, and for helping us dream my father's dream,'' Ms. Schlossberg said. ''As I look across this hall, and across this country, I know that my father's spirit lives on, and I thank all of you.''</p>
        <p>''Now, it is our turn to prove that the New Frontier was not a place in time, but a timeless call,'' she said,  referring to the signature phrase of her father's years in office. ''Now, we are the New Frontier. And now when many of us are doing so well, it is time once again to ask more of ourselves. As much as we need a prosperous economy, we also need a prosperity of kindness and decency.''</p>
        <p>It was a poignant moment for Ms. Schlossberg. Her simple agreement to speak here tonight -- she has all but disappeared from public view since her father's assassination in November 1963 -- was a reminder that she is now the only surviving member of the Kennedy family that occupied the White House from 1961 through 1963. Ms. Schlossberg's brother, John Jr., who enjoyed public attention almost as much as his sister shunned it, died in an airplane crash last summer.</p>
        <p>Ms. Schlossberg was one of four members of the extended Kennedy family who spoke here today, and her official task was to introduce ''Uncle Teddy,'' Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts.</p>
        <p>She took the stage to the sound of the theme from ''Camelot,'' the 1960's musical that became identified with her father's administration.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, her remarks were filled with mentions of her father, who died when she was 5 years old. They were a reminder of the continuing sway that the Kennedy family in general, and John F. Kennedy in particular, wields among Democrats at a convention where many of the delegates were not even born when Mr. Kennedy was president.</p>
        <p>She recalled her upbringing, saying: ''I was lucky enough to grow up in a world where adults taught by example. They dreamed impossible dreams, yet they fought hard each day to make those dreams come true.'' And she reminded the audience that her father, 40 years ago, wanted ''not only to make better the world that surrounds us but to dream of something more.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Schlossberg delivered the speech in a city that is for the Kennedys both a place of triumph, where her father was nominated to run for president, and of tragedy, because Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated not far from where Ms. Schlossberg spoke tonight, while he was campaigning for president in 1968.</p>
        <p>Indeed, she alluded to the losses that her family has suffered through violence, saying: ''If we believe that we have seen enough gun violence in our land and in our lifetimes -- that guns should no longer take the lives of those we love -- then it is up to us. If we believe in these things, then it is up to us to elect Al Gore and Joe Lieberman.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Schlossberg was poised but seemed a bit nervous as she looked out at a conventional hall crammed with delegates, onlookers and reporters. She proceeded to quote her father, suggesting that what he said in Los Angeles when he was nominated  for president was as relevant today as it was then.</p>
        <p>''Our call is to the young at heart, regardless of age,'' he said then. ''The whole world looks to see what  we will do. We cannot fail their trust; we cannot fail to try.''</p>
        <p>THE DEMOCRATS: THE KENNEDY FACTOR  Correction:  August 17, 2000, Thursday  An article yesterday about the speech by Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg at the Democratic National Convention referred incorrectly in some copies to her age when her father was assassinated. She was 5, not 6.</p>
