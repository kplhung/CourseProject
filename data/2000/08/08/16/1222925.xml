        <p>Benefiting from vibrant demand for regional jets, Empresa Brasileira de Aeronautica S.A. reported a 35 percent gain in second-quarter earnings today on a 54 percent surge in sales.</p>
        <p>The company, known as Embraer, is Brazil's largest manufacturing exporter and an emblem of Brazilian corporate success. In the recent quarter, it earned 112.9 million reais, or $62.6 million at current exchange rates, compared with 83.6 million reais in the period a year earlier. Quarterly sales rose to 1.2 billion reais, or $665.4 million.</p>
        <p>The results reflected the demand for Embraer's short-haul jets, the fastest-growing segment of the commercial aviation market. The planes seat 30 to 110 people, with a range of about 1,500 miles, and are more profitable to operate on many routes than larger aircraft.</p>
        <p>In the first half of the year, Embraer delivered 72 planes in the 30-  to 50-seat ERJ-135/145 family to airlines around the world, up from 38 in the first half of 1999. In an effort to meet increasing demand, Embraer has accelerated its production to 14 aircraft a month and plans to speed that up further, to 16 planes a month by year-end.</p>
        <p>Embraer valued its current backlog of undelivered planes at nearly $21 billion, of which $8.6 billion is in firm orders and $12.2 billion represents options on future purchases.</p>
        <p>The company's president, Mauricio Botelho, has said that it plans to invest about $1.4 billion between 2000 and 2004, with $1.1 billion going into the development of new models and $300 million into construction of a new plant and research center. Embraer recently introduced the 44-seat ERJ-140, and is developing a family of jets in the 70-to-110-seat category.</p>
        <p>For the first half of 2000, Embraer's earnings more than doubled, to 210.4 million reais, or $116.66 million, on a 62 percent increase in sales, to 2.2 billion reais, or $1.22 billion.</p>
        <p>The strong financial results helped divert attention from a recent decision against Brazil at the World Trade Organization in a case involving an Embraer rival, Bombardier of Canada. The W.T.O., which arbitrates disputes between member countries, is expected to rule in the next couple of weeks on the value of sanctions that the Canadian government can levy on Brazilian imports.</p>
        <p>In New York trading today, Embraer's American depository receipts fell 81.25 cents, to close at $23.6875. They began trading on July 21 at $18.50.</p>
