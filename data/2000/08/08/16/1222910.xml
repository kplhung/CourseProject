        <p>THE Daily Mail of London noted in an article this week that some airlines in Europe are ''manipulating timetables'' -- arbitrarily adding minutes to schedules to buy time against flight delays. One flight from London to Paris that took 50 minutes in 1975 now is scheduled for 95 minutes. That's five minutes longer than the same flight took in 1947, the newspaper said.</p>
        <p>On some days, as air traffic systems strain under the increased demand, a third of the flights in Western Europe are delayed. Yet, as annoying as this undoubtedly is, there is none of the same sense of crisis in Europe as in the United States over mounting gridlock in the skies.</p>
        <p>One reason is that there are alternatives. In Europe, the railroads remain vital components of the transportation system. Experienced American business travelers, traveling through Europe on those itineraries that flip them rapidly from one city to another, have learned that the train is almost always a better bet on a trip of 400 miles or less.</p>
        <p>High-speed trains traveling at speeds up to 200 miles an hour on new networks of dedicated track have become major competitors to airlines for the short-haul business travel market, said Joseph M. Fiorenza, vice president for business travel services of Rail Europe, a joint venture of the French and Swiss national railroads that sells European rail services in the United States (www.raileurope.com or 888 382-7245).</p>
        <p>''For a lot of business travelers, the whole air-to-rail equation is changing now that they can get from London to Paris, say, in about three hours -- and that's downtown to downtown, not outlying airport to airport,'' Mr. Fiorenza said.</p>
        <p>Eurostar passenger trains now make as many as 24 departures a day from London to Paris (three hours) or Brussels (2 hours and 36 minutes). On other European rail systems, trains are taking market share from planes. High-speed rail now accounts for 17 percent of all western European passenger traffic. In France, the figure is 48 percent.</p>
        <p>In the United States, can we expect ever to see anything approaching that kind of rail service as the air travel system reaches capacity?</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, we have a long way to go, on bumpy roadbed, before more than a relative handful of frequent travelers will regard trains as a practical alternative to planes. While European train lines persevered and improved over the years, the once-awesome United States rail system degenerated into a comparative Toonerville Trolley operation.</p>
        <p>Amtrak, the government-subsidized national rail company created in 1970 to salvage some intercity rail service, has swallowed an estimated $25 billion in subsidies since its inception. Some critics say the money hasn't bought anything approaching a first-rate rail system.</p>
        <p>For example, Amtrak's costly and much-heralded Acela Express, promising 150-mile-an-hour trains cutting about an hour off the more than four hours travel time between New York and Boston, has been delayed for more than a year because of track problems and design problems with the trains themselves.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, there are some small signs that, here and there, trains are hauling at least a handful of people who otherwise might be adding to sky-crowding. Last week, Amtrak said that ridership on the heavily traveled Northeast corridor route was up 6 percent in July. Travel to the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia accounted for some of that, but Amtrak said that some appears to have come from passengers who took the train because they were disgusted with routine flight delays.</p>
        <p>About 17 percent of the passengers on the Northeast corridor in the 1998 fiscal year were business travelers, said Rick Remington, an Amtrak spokesman. Critics of Amtrak as a sluggish bureaucracy might find it interesting that the latest demographic information Amtrak would provide for its ridership is two years old. Rail Europe was able to readily produce current figures.</p>
        <p>Assuming Amtrak eventually gets its Acela high-speed trains to run, it remains to be seen whether more than a handful of American business travelers will follow the patterns in western Europe, where a three-hour trip has become the point at which the scale tips between air and rail.</p>
        <p>Even with 1998 numbers, though, the prospects are interesting for the 18.3 million passengers Amtrak says traveled by train or air on Boston-New York-Philadelphia-Washington routes. Of that number, the train got about 71 percent of all passengers traveling between New York and Washington, a trip that takes about three hours maximum.</p>
        <p>But between New York and Boston, a trip that now takes over four hours by train, ''the figures really flip-flop,'' Mr. Remington said. On that route, planes get about 71 percent of the passengers.</p>
        <p>The three hours is the tipping point here as well, he said, adding, ''That's what high-speed rail is all about -- to get our New York-Boston market share closer to what we are between New York and Washington.''</p>
