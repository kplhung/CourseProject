        <p>ONE autumn day in the 1970's, when Harold L. Enarson was president of Ohio State University, he attended a football game in which Ohio State was pitted against one of its traditional rivals.</p>
        <p>As luck would have it, Ohio State lost. And, as even worse luck would have it, Mr. Enarson encountered a reporter for the student newspaper as he left the stadium.</p>
        <p>The reporter asked for his reaction to the defeat.</p>
        <p>Mr. Enarson shrugged and said, ''After all, it's only a game.''</p>
        <p>The next morning, a banner headline in the newspaper screamed ''AFTER ALL, IT'S ONLY A GAME!'' and an editorial thundered against the president for being destitute of team spirit.</p>
        <p>''That remark was never forgotten and never forgiven,'' Mr. Enarson recalled recently. ''No matter how dutiful I was in attending athletic events, which I hugely enjoyed, any hint that I wasn't a true jock was held against me.''</p>
        <p>Intercollegiate football -- the players are already in training for the new season -- demands absolute devotion. Not just from players, coaches and presidents, but from students, faculty, administrators, alumni and fans. And that is why abuses in the system so often go unreported and uncorrected, and why the game -- now more a fixture of the national entertainment industry than higher education -- is allowed to spread a corrupting influence.</p>
        <p>Standards of admission and academic performance are routinely cast to the winds for star football players, said Linda Bensel-Meyers, a Renaissance literature scholar at the University of Tennessee, who has challenged her university on those practices and is now embroiled in a bitter legal dispute.</p>
        <p>Worse yet, athletes are not infrequently accused of theft and the physical abuse of women, and the authorities are notoriously reluctant to punish them.</p>
        <p>In an interview shortly before his death a year ago, Michael Hooker, who was chancellor of the University of North Carolina, said corruption was widespread in intercollegiate football.</p>
        <p>But little is done about the problems because of this need for total devotion to the sport, and because so many colleges and universities have allowed themselves to become dependent on football for two vital commodities: money, from donors and from lucrative television contracts, and a flood of choice students.</p>
        <p>''Right now we're in the midst of a major fund-raising campaign,'' explained the trustee chairman of a large Midwestern university, ''and the entertainment value of football has a way of helping by keeping our name before the public.''</p>
        <p>As for recruiting students, admissions officers talk with awe about ''the Flutie spike'': the phenomenal increase in applications at Boston College in the mid-1980's tied to the heart-stopping performances of a quarterback named Doug Flutie.</p>
        <p>Admissions officers know that a star player can attract many more students than half a dozen Nobel Prize winners on the faculty.</p>
        <p>If there is any deliverance from this situation, it may be found in the work of Harvie Branscomb, the former chancellor of Vanderbilt University who died two years ago.</p>
        <p>Soon after he became chancellor, Mr. Branscomb recalled in his memoir, ''Purely Academic'' (Vanderbilt University Press, 1978), how he had set out to ''de-emphasize'' intercollegiate football. He decided to ''build up a countertradition, one of playing prestigious institutions not eminent for their athletics but for their academic accomplishment.''</p>
        <p>The plan backfired when Vanderbilt crushed Yale, dashing all hope of a rematch with any Ivy League college. A few years later, Mr. Branscomb urged the Vanderbilt trustees to put into practice a series of reforms, including reducing the number of athletic scholarships. But three days later, the Vanderbilt football team once again unwittingly sabotaged his effort. The team scored a sensational victory over Alabama, 22-20, which created such excitement in Nashville that all thought of reform evaporated.</p>
        <p>In his memoir, Mr. Branscomb made a final stab at the problem, which merits consideration today.</p>
        <p>Academic institutions that feel the need for semiprofessional sports teams, Mr. Branscomb said, should establish a school of athletics much like ones for dentistry and agriculture. The schools should offer preparation for sports careers and should also recruit the players needed for strong teams. And, responding to the concerns of people like Professor Bensel-Meyers, these specialized schools should relieve their academically oriented counterparts of the pressure to compromise admissions and other standards in order to produce championship teams.</p>
