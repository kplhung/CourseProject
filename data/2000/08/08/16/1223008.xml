        <p>Forty years after John F. Kennedy accepted the Democratic nomination in this city, his daughter, brother, niece and nephew sought to revive the liberal hearts of his party tonight by recalling the slain president's legacy and tying Vice President Al Gore to it.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Gore has offered himself as a president for a new century, the Democrats, on the second night of their national convention, staged a festival of the past. It was a carefully choreographed program intended to reassure loyalists that despite Mr. Gore's overtures to moderates, their party was not drifting from its principles of inclusiveness and tending to the downtrodden.</p>
        <p>The evening featured a parade of liberal stalwarts -- from Senator Edward M. Kennedy to the Rev. Jesse Jackson to former Senator Bill Bradley, Mr. Gore's vanquished rival for the nomination -- all of whom stood in sharp contrast with the platform that the delegates approved tonight, a document that called for a more potent military, expanded global trade and more accountability in schools for student performance.</p>
        <p>''If America is to secure prosperity, progress, peace and security for all,'' the platform proclaimed, ''we cannot afford to go back.''</p>
        <p>But some of the most stirring speeches were about the past.</p>
        <p>''It was here, in this City of Angels, on a warm summer night 40 years ago, that the America first looked across the New Frontier,'' declared Senator Kennedy, the most prominent liberal in Congress, as he eyed a sea of ''Kennedy'' placards. ''A New Frontier, as my brother said, where there were 'unsolved problems, unconquered pockets of ignorance and prejudice, unanswered questions of poverty and surplus.' ''</p>
        <p>Speaking of his brother, Mr. Kennedy said, ''How proud he would be of Al Gore and our party and the new barrier of bigotry we are breaking down with the choice of Joe Lieberman as the next vice president of the United States.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kennedy was introduced by his niece Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, who in her first speaking appearance before a Democratic convention said she was proud that Mr. Gore's running mate, Mr. Lieberman, had been inspired by her father to enter politics.</p>
        <p>''My father wanted for us as he stood here four decades ago not only to make better the world that surrounds us, but to dream of something more,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Her address was particularly poignant because she is the sole survivor of the former president's immediate family. Her mother, Jacqueline, died in 1994, and her brother, John F. Kennedy Jr., was killed in a plane crash last summer.</p>
        <p>For all the sentimentality, the symbols of the party's liberal wing were on stage to address one of Mr. Gore's most frustrating political problems: He is not particularly popular with the base voters of his party.</p>
        <p>As part of the Democrats' drive to enliven the party, several delivered intensely partisan speeches that repudiated Gov. George W. Bush's promise of compassion at the Republican convention in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>''That was the inclusion illusion,'' Mr. Jackson said. ''In Philadelphia, diversity ended on that stage. They could not mention the words Africa, Appalachia or AIDS once. So it is good to be in Los Angeles, to look over this great assembly and see the real deal -- the quilt of many patches that is America.''</p>
        <p>The cavalcade of liberals was a decided contrast to the Republican convention, when conservative figures, the most steadfast party loyalists, were largely kept offstage.</p>
        <p>Just as the Republicans put Mr. Bush's primary opponent, Senator John McCain, on center stage, the Democrats tonight gave a prime-time spot to Mr. Bradley.</p>
        <p>Offering some of his most lavish praise thus far for the vice president, Mr. Bradley said: ''I learned that Al Gore is a man of wide-ranging intellect, with a deep desire to serve, profound preparation for the job, a strong sense of loyalty, and a life infused with tolerance and roots in religious faith. What strikes me is that what we share is so much more than what we disagree on.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bradley devoted most of his speech to delivering a pitch for his party and excoriating Republicans as impostors. ''We don't window-dress diversity; we are the party of diversity,'' he said. ''Don't read my lips; watch what we do. Watch what we have always done, what the values of our party have always been.''</p>
        <p>For all the talk of the past, the keynote speaker tonight was only 30 years old: Representative Harold Ford Jr., from Mr. Gore's home state of Tennessee. Democratic officials said Mr. Ford was a perfect cap for the evening not only because of his youth, and because he is an African American who represents diversity, but also because he is a moderate.</p>
        <p>''I stand here tonight because of the brave men and women, many no older than I am today,'' Mr. Ford said, ''who were willing to stand up, and in many cases sit down, to create a more perfect union.''</p>
        <p>''But I also stand here representing a new generation,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Ford did not get the usual exposure of the top-billed speaker. He did not take the stage until nearly 11 p.m. E.D.T., when the major networks ended their coverage.</p>
        <p>The evening was also an opportunity to several Democratic constituencies to make their case.</p>
        <p>Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, said, ''Because I am a woman, because I am a mother and a grandmother, because I am an American, and because I believe in the promise of this nation, I believe that women must have the right to choose -- and so do Al Gore and Joe Lieberman.''</p>
        <p>Several delegates said they appreciated the tilt of the speakers. ''There is definitely a left-leaning message to young people like me and Democrats with a more idealistic agenda,'' said Allison Friedrich, 22, a delegate from Athens, Ohio. ''It says they're still fighting for us and that our vote is still important to Al Gore.''</p>
        <p>Much of the evening was devoted to speakers' tales of attending the convention when John Kennedy was nominated. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recalled that he was 6 years old at the time and likened his uncle's New Frontier to Mr. Gore, who he said ''will make history by validating our nation's legacy for world leadership and environmental responsibility.''</p>
        <p>Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, the lieutenant governor of Maryland, spoke of an American dream ''that my uncle and my father, Robert Kennedy, shared, just as they share a love for the Democratic Party.''</p>
        <p>''We will not achieve that dream unless we have a leader who understands the forces at work in our world,'' she said, ''and works to extend the blessings of prosperity to every American. That leader is Al Gore.''</p>
