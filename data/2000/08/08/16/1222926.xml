        <p>Independence Day, as observed here today in the unhappy summer capital of India's unhappiest state, was an eerie kind of national holiday, with almost everyone staying indoors, partly out of fear for their lives.</p>
        <p>Their apprehensiveness had two sources: first, the militant groups who are prone to protest Indian rule with explosive devices, and second, the Indian security forces who are prone to treat the masses as if they were the militants.</p>

        <p>Independence Day, as observed here today in the unhappy summer capital of India's unhappiest state, was an eerie kind of national holiday, with almost everyone staying indoors, partly out of fear for their lives.</p>
        <p>Their apprehensiveness had two sources: first, the militant groups who are prone to protest Indian rule with explosive devices, and second, the Indian security forces who are prone to treat the masses as if they were the militants.</p>
        <p>And there was a third reason as well for ignoring the nationwide festivities: most people here don't consider themselves part of the nation.</p>
        <p>''I am a Kashmiri, not an Indian,'' said Ghulam Muhammad, 64, one of the few who emerged from his house to enjoy a balmy summer day. ''We want our freedom.''</p>
        <p>He paused for a moment, allowing his emotions to be moderated by his pessimism. ''But this will never happen,'' he said. ''India will never let us go.''</p>
        <p>That is the prevailing sentiment in the Kashmir Valley, a place of legendary beauty, and, for the past decade, unremitting bloodshed.</p>
        <p>Since 1989, the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir has been one of the most violent places in the world with more than 25,000 people killed: by separatists who want their own homeland; by Islamic holy warriors who believe India's only Muslim majority state should be part of neighboring Pakistan; by Indian forces who have tried to crush rebellion with the might of an occupying army.</p>
        <p>Today, with all the paradoxes of an Independence Day among a citizenry that thinks itself so oppressed, Srinagar was, more than usually, a place of militarized vigilance, of rifle-toting soldiers on every street, bunkers surrounded by sand bags, road blocks, drop gates, speed bumps and car searches.</p>
        <p>The day's only official event was a morning ceremony in huge Bakshi Stadium. In a rare bit of agreement, both the militants and the military agreed that people should not attend. The militants had called for a strike; the military cordoned off the area and allowed no one near.</p>
        <p>''Who would want to attend anyway?'' said K. Rajendra Kumar, the deputy inspector general of the state police. His men were in battle gear, his snipers peered down from windows. ''People are afraid to die.''</p>
        <p>Inside the stadium, Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah -- often criticized in Srinagar as too close to New Delhi -- gave an impassioned speech, his amplified words floating out across the empty seats. His audience was mainly a brass band and army regiments. The spectators in uniform overwhelmingly exceeded those in plain clothes -- and those in plain clothes were mostly state police officers.</p>
        <p>The Indian flag, a rare sight in Indian Kashmir, was successfully hoisted. ''I hope to God that the kind of security arrangements we have done today, we will not need to do again in the future,'' Mr. Abdullah said later.</p>
        <p>There was a second ceremonial flag-raising, this time by the Indian border security force. They raised the nation's tricolor banner above the clock tower in Lal Chowk, ordinarily a teeming bazaar in the center of the city but nearly deserted today.</p>
        <p>K. Vijay Kumar, who heads the border force in Srinagar, made a good attempt at normalcy. He smiled broadly, ''Come, have a cup of tea,'' he said to a bevy of photographers there to capture the feeble pageantry.</p>
        <p>Most of the soldiers on patrol, including the border force, are not  Kashmiris. Their presence is resented, sometimes even by the local police.</p>
        <p>''People have been brutally massacred for the past 10 years -- economically, militarily, spiritually,'' a deputy superintendent of police said. ''All that people are interested in now is peace, whichever way it can come. But no one is making a sincere effort at peace.''</p>
        <p>Sadly, just three weeks ago, rare optimism surged through Kashmir. One of the main militant groups, the Hizbul Mujahadeen, had declared a three-month cease-fire. The Indian government agreed to open preliminary peace talks.</p>
        <p>This sudden turn seemed to surprise many of those involved, most notably Pakistan, one of the Hizbul's patrons; other militant groups, who declared the Hizbul traitorous; and even some of the Hizbul leadership itself, who began to complicate the unconditional cease-fire with difficult conditions. They finally issued an ultimatum, and, by Aug. 8 deemed peace to have had enough of a chance.</p>
        <p>Killing has since resumed its rigorous pace. And indeed, Independence Day was expected to be marked in blood. Little violence was reported, however, something the security forces attributed to their own wariness and circumspection.</p>
        <p>On Monday night, the bombing of a train did claim at least 10 lives, but that was in the state of Uttar Pradesh and was most likely the work of anti-national elements with concerns entirely different from those in Kashmir.</p>
        <p>The Kashmir dispute actually has its roots in independence. In 1947, when Pakistan and India were carved from the British Empire, both of the infant countries felt a rightful claim to the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
        <p>Among their first acts of nationhood was to fight a war, which left India with about two-thirds of the most populous part of the territory and Pakistan with the rest -- a situation that has proven unsatisfactory to all involved.</p>
        <p>Chief Minister Abdullah, orating in Bakshi Stadium, pointed out that the conflict was now all the more perilous, with India and Pakistan possessing nuclear weapons. He beseeched Pakistan to stop supporting militants in ''cross-border terrorism.'' And, as his voice disappeared into the emptiness, he insisted that ''friendship must be better than threatening each other with atomic bombs.''</p>
