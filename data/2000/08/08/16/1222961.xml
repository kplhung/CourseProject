        <p>The Durst Organization, developer of the recently completed Times Square office building at 42nd Street and Seventh Avenue and the owner of a portfolio of Manhattan properties, plans a new speculative project on the block bounded by 11th and 12th Avenues and 57th and 58th Streets.</p>

        <p>The Durst Organization, developer of the recently completed Times Square office building at 42nd Street and Seventh Avenue and the owner of a portfolio of Manhattan properties, plans a new speculative project on the block bounded by 11th and 12th Avenues and 57th and 58th Streets.</p>
        <p>Unlike the company's other buildings, the six-story, 500,000-square-foot structure is not intended to house people. Instead, it is being designed for machinery, the servers, routers and switches that are the physical underpinning of the rapidly growing electronic commerce being conducted on the Internet.</p>
        <p>The new building would occupy the middle of the block between a Potamkin Toyota, Dodge and Volkswagen auto dealership on 11th Avenue and the Artkraft Strauss factory on 12th Avenue, where some of the brightly lighted signs that adorn Times Square are made. The space in between is occupied by low-rise buildings housing auto repair shops, an Airborne Express package delivery operation and the Copacabana nightclub.</p>
        <p>These buildings are scheduled to be demolished, starting in June of next year, provided city officials agree to change the zoning on most of the site from manufacturing to commercial. (The zoning on part of the site would remain unchanged in the hope of attracting an auto dealership to the first-floor retail space of the building, because a manufacturing zone is needed to perform auto repairs.)</p>
        <p>Douglas Durst, president of the Durst Organization, said the company had acquired a 99-year lease on the land underneath the buildings about a year ago and had notified tenants on short-term, cancelable leases that they would be canceled.  ''This is a site that has been waiting to be developed,'' said Thomas M. Bow, Durst's director of leasing.</p>
        <p>The development of the site appears to be another step in the conversion of the far West Side of Manhattan from industrial and distribution operations to commercial and office uses.</p>
        <p>The new building will be called the NYCyberCenter. It is a new type of property known in the industry as a telecom hotel, because it houses equipment belonging to many different telecommunications companies. Although rivals, the companies prefer to be grouped together in a few locations so they can interconnect simply and inexpensively.</p>
        <p>Durst officials say that as far as they know, this will be the first new, from-the-ground-up project of its kind in the central business district of a major city. The existing telecom hotels in New York, like the buildings at 60 Hudson Street and 111 Eighth  Avenue at 16th Street, were conversions of existing structures.</p>
        <p>The need for new telecommunications locations has almost nothing to do with voice communications and everything to do with the growth of business-to-business operations over the Web, said Robert P. Stella, a senior vice president of CB Richard Ellis, a real estate brokerage and services company. ''Web hosting for business to business is a high-margin business, not voice,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Although Durst usually handles the leasing operations for its office buildings internally, it has signed up with the Ellis organization to handle the leasing for the CyberCenter. ''We have a group of brokers that has been working with telecommunications, media and Internet companies the last nine years,'' he said. ''We have represented them as tenants and we know what their needs are.''</p>
        <p>The Durst Organization typically does not begin a project without signing at least one large anchor tenant. But Douglas Durst said this project would proceed without one because ''I am confident in this market.''</p>
        <p>The new building will be across 58th Street from a power plant operated by Consolidated Edison and the company is expected to supply an unusual amount of power -- as much as 100 watts per square foot, compared with 4 or 5 watts a square foot in a typical office building. All the densely packed equipment in the building will be electrically powered, and additional power is needed to keep temperatures under control.</p>
        <p>The building is being designed to be ''friendly'' to equipment. Ceiling heights are 17 feet from slab to slab to accommodate tall racks of electronics, and a special mechanical equipment zone has been established at the northern end of each floor for the air-conditioning, electrical generators and battery backups each tenant is expected to install. The floors in these areas are to be specially reinforced to carry the load.</p>
        <p>Space is being allocated below ground for fuel tanks to power the generators and water tanks for the air-conditioning equipment. Three freight elevators with the capacity to lift 12,000 pounds each will be installed and will extend to open on the roof. The roof will be reinforced to allow installation of satellite dishes and other antennas as well as mechanical and electrical equipment.</p>
