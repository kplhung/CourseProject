        <p>Rejecting the State Legislature's attempt to join the growing list of states that restrict abortion for teenagers, the New Jersey Supreme Court today struck down a law requiring parental notice for unmarried girls under age 18.</p>
        <p>The court's 4-to-2 decision held that the notice requirement, enacted and signed by Gov. Christine Todd Whitman last year, violated the equal protection guarantee of the New Jersey Constitution by imposing a burden on minors seeking abortions that it did not impose on those who continue their pregnancies.</p>
        <p>The decision signaled that even with many new appointees, the court continues to give individual liberties more expansive protection than the federal courts, as it has for decades. And lawmakers complained today, as they have for decades, about the court's readiness to overturn legislation.</p>
        <p>Assembly Speaker Jack Collins, a Republican from Salem County, said the decision ''stretches the imagination.'' He added: ''This court, as they continually do, decide what they want the laws of this state to be.''</p>
        <p>By relying on the State Constitution, the court was more protective of abortion rights than the United States Supreme Court, which has upheld parental notification statutes as long as they provided for a waiver of the requirement by a judge.</p>
        <p>About 40 states have enacted laws requiring parental involvement, and in some cases a parent's consent, in a minor's abortion decision. New York and Connecticut do not require any notice to parents.</p>
        <p>Today's decision cannot be appealed, as the State Supreme Court is the final arbiter of the New Jersey Constitution. The court had blocked enforcement of the law pending its full review.</p>
        <p>Both sides agreed today that the court's strong language left little if any room for the Legislature to amend the statute. Rather,  opponents of abortion said they would work toward a constitutional amendment.</p>
        <p>One of them, Marie Tasy, an official of New Jersey Right to Life, said, ''I think the decision is outrageous, that it defies common sense and ignores the integrity of the family.''</p>
        <p>Within hours, some legislators called for a reconsideration of the judicial selection process here and even for impeachment proceedings against the four justices who joined the majority.</p>
        <p>The decision relieved abortion rights advocates, who had been surprised by the legislation and alarmed by Governor Whitman's quick assent to it, at a time when she was currying support from conservatives in preparation to run for the United States Senate.</p>
        <p>''We're just delighted that the Supreme Court reaffirmed New Jersey's strong commitment to reproductive choice and recognized the substantial burdens this placed on New Jersey teenagers,'' said Jennifer Dalven, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation, who argued the case for Planned Parenthood and abortion providers.</p>
        <p>The state court used the same equal protection analysis in deciding the parental notification case that it had used, in 1982, in striking down a ban on Medicaid financing for abortions.</p>
        <p>Citing that precedent, the majority opinion, written by Chief Justice Deborah T. Poritz, said the State Constitution ''does not permit the state to impose disparate and unjustifiable burdens on different classes of young women when fundamental constitutional rights hang in the balance.''</p>
        <p>Lenora Lapidus, legal director of the A.C.L.U. in Newark, noted that the justices, most of them appointees of Mrs. Whitman, ''did nothing out of line here but continued the long tradition of interpreting our state's Constitution protectively and broadly to guarantee fundamental rights.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Lapidus said parental notice statutes had been struck down on similar grounds by state courts in Florida, Montana, Alaska and California.</p>
        <p>The New Jersey law, passed in June 1999 by a vote of 59 to 17 in the Assembly and 31 to 8 in the Senate, was supposed to have been saved by its ''judicial bypass'' provision. That provision allows a judge to waive the notification requirement if it would not be in the girl's best interest or if she is ''sufficiently mature'' to make her own decision. But the court held that the hearing procedure itself was a burden that could not be justified by the state's interest in requiring notification.</p>
        <p>The governor, a Republican, had previously opposed a parental notification requirement. But she was under attack from anti-abortion forces, especially after her veto of legislation banning the late-term procedure that critics call partial-birth abortion, and was making amends with conservatives when she signed the notification bill.</p>
        <p>The law was to have taken effect last September, but Justice Gary S. Stein blocked enforcement pending an expedited decision by a lower court and direct review of that ruling by the full Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>In December, Judge Marguerite T. Simon of Superior Court upheld the statute, holding that it did not place an ''undue burden'' on the right to abortion.</p>
        <p>In reversing that decision, Chief Justice Poritz was joined by Justice Stein and Justices James H. Coleman Jr. and Virginia A. Long. Justices Daniel J. O'Hern and Peter G. Verniero dissented.</p>
        <p>Of Governor Whitman's six appointees to the court, three -- Justices Poritz, Coleman and Long -- joined the majority, Justice Verniero dissented and two others, Jaynee LaVecchia and James R. Zazzali, joined the court too recently to have heard the case.</p>
        <p>Since the governor signed the bill, she has been viewed with some bitterness by advocates for abortion rights. Elizabeth Volz, the president of the New Jersey chapter of the National Organization for Women, said today that Mrs. Whitman had ''decided that the Republican Party was more important to her than the young women of New Jersey.''</p>
        <p>The governor's reaction to the decision today was muted.</p>
        <p>She said in a statement that the administration was reviewing the opinion and that when she signed the legislation, ''I believed that the bill struck a common-sense balance'' between the rights of parents to be informed and the rights of minors to choose whether to have an abortion.</p>
