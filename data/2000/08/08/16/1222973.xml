        <p>Editorial says Democratic presidential candidate Vice Pres Al Gore and Republican rival Gov George W Bush seem eager for renewed clash centered on competing brands of economic populism, noting oratory in both campaigns and recently at Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles; says while target presented by Bush may in one sense be irresistible, underlying reality is that Democrats do offer fairer approach to parceling out benefits of Clinton boom (M) running mate,' is irresistible (M)</p>

        <p>Depending on your point of view, it was either old-time religion night or dinosaur time at the Democratic National Convention. Two of the party's great roarers, Senator Ted Kennedy and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, were on hand to remind the faithful of the party's traditional New Deal values. John F. Kennedy's only surviving child, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, reminded voters of that golden era when Democrats like her father could depend on a solid base of blue-collar voters. Earlier in the day Vice President Al Gore was in Michigan, the heart of union country, to warn that ''the powerful interests are going to fight against us with everything they've got'' to prevent the Democratic ticket from defending working families.</p>
        <p>Even before Franklin D. Roosevelt's politically productive attacks on financial ''royalists,'' economic populism was a staple of Democratic campaigns. For years, when Democrats turned to their venerable themes of economic justice and fairer income distribution, the Republicans accused them of promoting class warfare, but to little avail. Then under the tutelage of Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, the G.O.P. learned to trump the Democrats' appeals to middle-class financial solidarity with their own appeals to Main Street in the form of a cultural populism built around a powerful set of patriotic, religious and racial symbols.

        <p>Even before Franklin D. Roosevelt's politically productive attacks on financial ''royalists,'' economic populism was a staple of Democratic campaigns. For years, when Democrats turned to their venerable themes of economic justice and fairer income distribution, the Republicans accused them of promoting class warfare, but to little avail. Then under the tutelage of Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, the G.O.P. learned to trump the Democrats' appeals to middle-class financial solidarity with their own appeals to Main Street in the form of a cultural populism built around a powerful set of patriotic, religious and racial symbols. Now both Mr. Gore and his Republican opponent, Gov. George W. Bush, seem eager for a renewed clash centered on their competing brands of populism.</p>
        <p>Although the apostate Clinton strategist, Dick Morris, argues that Mr. Gore is making a mistake to revive ''liberal'' economic themes, both Mr. Gore and President Clinton seem confident the Democratic ticket can win an argument over who gets the fruits of what Mr. Gore calls ''unprecedented economic abundance.'' In one sense, the target presented by Mr. Bush, with his old-money pedigree and his oil-patch running mate, is irresistible. He would spend billions on tax relief for investors, top earners and inheritors of large estates. His plan is a perfect setup for Mr. Gore's favorite pitch that he ''fights for working families'' while the G.O.P. remains the party of ''the wealthy, the well connected and the powerful.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's rhetoric, like that of Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Jackson, has a root system that dates back to William Jennings Bryan. Populism in its original form arose as a protest against the ability of agricultural, railroad and industrial interests to buy influence over government policy. Today's soft-money game is a lineal descendant of that form of corruption -- a fact that undercuts the purity of Mr. Gore's claim to be an opponent of special interests. In fact, the Democrats have been lapping up soft money from corporations and wealthy donors, having already passed $120 million before starting the fund-raising events associated with their convention. As John Broder and Don Van Natta Jr. reported in yesterday's Times, corporate donors and lobbyists play the money game at both conventions in what Senator Russell Feingold calls a ''system of legalized extortion and legalized bribery.'' The inescapable conclusion is that Mr. Gore, no amateur exaggerator, grossly exaggerates his party's independence of special interests.</p>
        <p>Even so, the convention oratory reflects an underlying reality that the Democrats do offer a fairer approach to parceling out the benefits of the Clinton boom. Mr. Gore's promise to take on the drug companies and health management organizations does have more credibility than Mr. Bush's less aggressive proposals. Moreover, should he carry out his campaign promise to outlaw soft money contributions that have tainted both conventions, Mr. Gore will have put some real muscle behind the Democrats' quadrennial exercise in ringing the century-old chimes of economic populism.</p>
