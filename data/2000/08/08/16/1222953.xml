        <p>A former chief financial officer for Black Entertainment Television is set to file a lawsuit in Washington today contending that the company; its chairman, Robert L. Johnson; and its president, Debra Lee, made extensive efforts to evade the payment of some taxes.</p>
        <p>The allegations appear in a wrongful-termination suit by the former employee, Dwight Crawford, who is seeking $21 million in damages for financial loss and emotional distress.</p>
        <p>The complaint, made available yesterday by the Washington law firm of Bernabei &amp; Katz, describes a wide-ranging pattern of misappropriation of corporate funds for personal use and strategies to reduce corporate expenses and taxes by a number of top-level executives. The suit contends that the defendants used corporate funds and credit cards for personal purchases, and then wrote off the purchases as business expenses. In one case, the complaint said, Mr. Johnson charged expenses related to his daughter's horse show.</p>
        <p>The suit also contends that BET, a unit of BET Holdings II, made an agreement with the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, a labor union, for production and broadcast of movies and television programs that required hiring a union staff. But rather than hiring the staff, the company arranged with Butch Lewis, a friend of Mr. Johnson, to create a dummy company that would hire the staff and supply them to BET as independent contractors. That strategy, the complaint says, would let BET ''evade liability for withholding of taxes from wages of these employees.''</p>
        <p>Neither Mr. Johnson nor Ms. Lee could be reached for comment yesterday. Byron Marchant, general counsul for BET, a network with four cable services geared to black viewers, said, ''The company has not yet been served with a complaint, so we don't have official notice of the suit, and I cannot comment.''</p>
        <p>The suit contends that in knowingly deducting personal expenses as business expenses, BET violated federal and state law. The executives, the suit adds, also avoided paying income taxes on the value of the goods they had acquired.</p>
        <p>The suit also contends that a 1999 audit by PricewaterhouseCoopers found that BET was planning to take an illegal $6 million tax deduction for the 1998 fiscal year when it had distributed that amount in profits to Mr. Johnson, who owns 65 percent of BET Holdings, and Liberty Media, which owns the balance. BET falsely reported the payment as an expenditure for salary and consulting, rather than as a dividend, the suit said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Crawford said he could not enforce financial compliance standards without the support of top management. And as disputes between him and other company managers mounted, Mr. Crawford said, Ms. Lee made it clear that his services were no longer wanted. However, Mr. Crawford said he did not resign, despite Ms. Lee's requests, and was ultimately dismissed in January.</p>
        <p>The suit states that Mr. Crawford had been senior vice president and treasurer of Discovery Communications Inc., owner of the Discovery Channel, the cable programming service, before joining BET.</p>
