        <p>Trade publications reported that Ogilvy &amp; Mather joined the review after D'Arcy and Mullen made final presentations last month.</p>
        <p>The global branding duties had been handled by Lowe Lintas &amp; Partners Worldwide, part of the Lowe Group unit of Interpublic, until they parted ways several months ago.</p>
        <p>Doremus in New York, part of the Omnicom Group, continues to handle so-called tombstone advertising and Mezzina Brown &amp; Partners in New York, handles recruitment communications and advertising.</p>
