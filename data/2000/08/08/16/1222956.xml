        <p>New York City officials ''blew it,'' Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday, when they failed to determine if a Brooklyn landlord had complied with an October order to repair a defective sprinkler system. A young girl died in a fire in the building last month.</p>
        <p>''It leaves a lot to be desired,'' the mayor said of the performance of the staff at the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development. ''They should have done a better job here.''</p>
        <p>The comments came in response to an article in The New York Times yesterday that noted that after housing officials on several occasions could not gain access to the building at 27 Brevoort Place to confirm if the repairs twice promised by the owner in November had been made, they closed the case in December.</p>
        <p>On July 22, a 13-year-old girl died in a fire at the five-story brownstone in Bedford-Stuyvesant, in which the sprinklers did not work. One person was seriously injured, six other residents suffered minor injuries, and 10 firefighters received minor injuries during the early-morning blaze.</p>
        <p>Because arson is suspected, Mr. Giuliani cautioned yesterday that he did not want to ''put the direct responsibility in the wrong place.'' But he repeatedly said he thought that the city had failed to do its job, asserting that in the future, the agency should go to court if necessary to win access to the building involved.</p>
        <p>''The answer is we should be much more aggressive,'' the mayor said. ''Obviously, somebody blew it.''</p>
        <p>Others joined in the chorus of criticism yesterday. C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president, said she was incredulous at the city's handling of the case.</p>
        <p>If necessary, she said, the city should have made the repairs on its own and charged the building owner. She said the City Council should examine the matter more thoroughly.</p>
        <p>The inspectors were not allowed to force their way into the building, but a court order to require access to the building could have been sought.</p>
        <p>Alan G. Hevesi, the city comptroller, said yesterday that he first called attention to weaknesses in the city's building code enforcement program in 1995, but that the case illustrated that the recommended improvements were not made.</p>
        <p>After the fatal fire, housing department officials made two procedural changes in an effort to prevent another similar event. Fire hazard cases will no longer be closed for lack of access to a building, and they will also be referred to the Fire Department, an official with the housing department said. The building's owner, Antonio Casanova, could not be reached for comment yesterday.</p>
