        <p>Karenna Gore Schiff reached into her purse and pulled out a clump of typewritten pages. They were pockmarked by harsh X's through several paragraphs, dashes through words and arrows to the margins.</p>
        <p>''It's a mess!'' she lamented. ''Here it is. It's like this, and I'm trying to figure out this, and I do it down here, and I cross out, and then I've got all this and I'm not sure if I should add this, and maybe it's too long, and I'm going this afternoon to type it up again and ask someone to look at it, whoever has time.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Schiff was going through a few unsurprising frantic moments as she prepared to do something no other young woman has done: introduce the roll call that will formally nominate her father for president.</p>
        <p>However daunting the speech-writing process -- a task that, like her father, she is doing herself -- she has a keen sense of purpose. ''I care very passionately about these issues, I really do -- that's why I'm involved in the campaign,'' she said, referring to campaign finance, the environment and matters of social justice in an interview in a hotel room between campaign stops. ''But I know that's not why I'm there.''</p>
        <p>She will be there, on the podium at the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday night, because she is Al Gore's best witness.</p>
        <p>The last year has been a coming out party, of sorts, for Ms. Schiff, who, at 27, was only recently steeped in a self-described ''rebellious'' stage, in which she gave herself over to punk bands and all-black outfits before and after attending Harvard.</p>
        <p>And as a result of her work with her father, many Democrats have speculated that she will one day have her own political career, a notion she does not reject out of hand but does not relish talking about.</p>
        <p>Because she lives in New York, where loads of Democratic money can be found, Mr. Gore makes frequent detours to the city. His daughter's Upper East Side apartment serves as an unofficial campaign headquarters, the scene of cocktail receptions and strategy sessions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore says his oldest daughter has ''perfect pitch, or very nearly perfect pitch.'' And that trust in her judgment has led to her involvement in most of the major decisions of her father's campaign, including the controversy over the high-priced hiring of Naomi Wolf, the feminist consultant and a friend of Ms. Schiff, and the selection of his running mate.</p>
        <p>But on at least one occasion, that pitch veered off-key, largely because of her uncritical devotion to her father. A senior Gore aide has said it was Ms. Schiff who urged her father in March 1997 to hold a news conference at which he said seven times that there was ''no controlling legal authority'' to prohibit making fund-raising calls from the White House.</p>
        <p>Ms. Schiff did not come up with that unfortunate phrase, advisers say, but, because she so thoroughly believed in her father's innocence, she pushed him to speak to the cameras before others felt he was ready.</p>
        <p>She has also been exposed to the chaos that can come from being so close to the action. One searing experience was in February at a hastily arranged meeting between her father and the Rev. Al Sharpton, whose political blessing Mr. Gore wanted, before the New York primary, but without pictures directly linking him to the fiery figure.</p>
        <p>The meeting, stealthily conducted at Ms. Schiff's apartment, turned into a media frenzy with television cameras staked out at her building and her privacy threatened.</p>
        <p>As a new wife (she married Dr. Andrew Schiff in 1997), a new mother (her son, Wyatt, was born July 4, 1999) and a new law school graduate, she possesses important demographic credentials. She has raised money among women and the under-30 set while growing ever more comfortable campaigning.</p>
        <p>Her ease of manner, the elastic band she slips around her wrist when she shakes out her ponytail, and her exuberance at extolling the virtues of the George Foreman grill, as seen on late-night infomercials, all lend her an air of authenticity that the campaign hopes rubs off on her father. The not-so-subtle thinking: If Mr. Gore can have a daughter who seems natural and appealing, he must be a good guy himself.</p>
        <p>One striking scene this year was when Ms. Schiff graduated from Columbia Law School and her father spoke at the ceremony. Mr. Gore shook hands with every graduate, and when his daughter strode across the stage, he formally stuck out his hand again. No, Dad. (Or, as he might say in one of his attempts to show he is with it: Hellllo?) She pulled him close and wrapped her arms around him.</p>
        <p>Ms. Schiff is also Exhibit A in conveying to working mothers that Mr. Gore understands them. He mentions his grandson in nearly every speech, and the campaign eagerly alerts reporters when Mr. Gore is baby-sitting. She also happily discusses the concerns of new mothers, like breast-feeding. ''I am totally supportive of nursing in public, or wherever the hell it's necessary,'' she recently told thatglow.com, an online pregnancy magazine. ''I remember nursing in Central Park and I fantasized about getting arrested and thrown in jail for nursing. Then I could lead a massive picket line of nursing mothers.''</p>
        <p>And Ms. Schiff offers a made-for-the-media counterpart to George P. Bush, Gov. George W. Bush's 24-year-old nephew, who is storming the youth culture for the Republicans.</p>
        <p>As the granddaughter of a senator and the daughter of a man who has served in the House, the Senate and the vice presidency, Ms. Schiff can match the Bush political lineage, but talk of being her father's heir apparent makes her uncomfortable.</p>
        <p>Still, it was she who made the decision to take a public role in her father's campaign and who emerged as a natural political partner for her father. One sister, Kristin, 23, a comedy writer in Los Angeles, is tentatively following her lead and making a few public appearances at convention activities this week. But her other siblings, Sarah, 21, and Albert III, 17, remain in the background. Because Mr. Gore felt so directed from an early age by his father, friends and family say that he has studiously avoided exerting the same pressure on his own children.</p>
        <p>''He really, honestly, never asked me to do anything, and I don't think he ever would,'' Ms. Schiff said. ''He's very conscious of not putting pressure on us.''</p>
        <p>She added: ''I could just go off and be a quilter in the mountains and that would be more than fine with them. But it just turns out that I actually am quite stimulated and engaged and interested and really moved by this political moment.''</p>
