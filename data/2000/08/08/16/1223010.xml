        <p>Caryn James Critic's Notebook observes that Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg created most emotional moment of Democratic convention merely by walking on stage to stains of Camelot; also contributing to Democrats' effective use of television are Jesse Jackson's old-time power, and Bill Clinton himself, unmatched master of political performance (M)</p>

        <p>All she had to do was walk on stage, ''Camelot'' playing behind her, to create the most emotional moment of the Democratic convention. Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg was poised in her brief speech. She was there to introduce her uncle, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, but more important to evoke all the memories of her relatives. ''When my brother and I were growing up,'' she said, every day someone told them how inspiring their father had been. Her style evoked her mother: the simple hair and dress, the sense of allowing the television audience access to her famously private life.

And she provided the ripple effect of publicity few can, as she gave bland interviews on last night's ABC, CBS and NBC evening news programs, and a more touching one with Tom Brokaw and Tim Russert on MSNBC after her speech, saying she felt that in spirit her whole family was with her onstage.</p>

        <p>Simply by getting Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg to speak in prime time, the Democrats revealed their grasp of the convention as show business. Ms. Schlossberg can attract viewers who care nothing about politics. The Caroline factor is more emotional than high-minded, more practical than political, and good marketing: viewers who come to gawk at a celebrity may pick up a bit of the party's message along the way. And she provided the ripple effect of publicity few can, as she gave bland interviews on last night's ABC, CBS and NBC evening news programs, and a more touching one with Tom Brokaw and Tim Russert on MSNBC after her speech, saying she felt that in spirit her whole family was with her onstage.</p>
        <p>The Democrats' sense of theater is simply one reason their convention is more effective as television than the Republican meeting. The proximity to Hollywood, of course, gave plenty of opportunity for star-gazing. (Warren Beatty breezing through the crowd, Jimmy Smits in a skybox.)</p>
        <p>And last night there were speeches of unexpected, old-time power. Jesse Jackson put on his reading glasses and, until the end, was uncharacteristically sedate (CNN actually cut away partway through). Mr. Kennedy gave a rousing speech about health care; Bill Bradley was so impassioned his supporters must have wondered where that delivery wasin the primaries.</p>
        <p>But no one could match the speech given by Bill Clinton the night before, which proved his mastery of political performance. He demonstrated that he can do what none of the presidential and vice-presidential candidates can: engage the camera and maintain a visceral connection with his audience even when he's saying something serious. Mr. Gore, Mr. Lieberman and George W. Bush can all manage that emotional contact in casual, close-up television appearances. (Dick Cheney has trouble with that much.) When making a serious point, though, their own eyes glazed over; imagine what happens to ours. But when Mr. Clinton said that it would be a mistake to underestimate American military strength, he looked into the camera, as if staring down an enemy.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Clinton has a shrewd grasp of how the media has changed in the age of talk-show confessions. By talking about his need for forgiveness before an audience of ministers and cameras last week, he got the Lewinsky affair out of the way before the convention. But even the famed Clinton compartmentalizing goes only so far. His contrite appearance before the ministers was not quickly shuffled to the video archives. Clips have been played so relentlessly that it must be at least as familiar to viewers as any snippet of his convention speech. In the end, even Mr. Clinton can't completely control his image.</p>
        <p>And if he, with his supreme mastery of television, can't do that, what hope is there for a media mortal like Al Gore? His iconic moment boomeranged yesterday. The uninspired passing of the torch from Mr. Clinton to Mr. Gore in Michigan left the vice president looking diminished. Mr. Clinton spoke briefly, then relinquished his place to Mr. Gore, who took off his jacket as he stepped forward. Maybe he was hot.</p>
        <p>But there has been so much publicity about the reconstructed Gore images that the move seemed calculated to show him in a more casual light and to distinguish him from the president. Mr. Clinton would have made such a gesture seem natural, even if it wasn't. Mr. Gore made it seem false, even if it was genuine.</p>
        <p>The true iconic image had been created the night before, when Mr. Clinton hoisted an Oscar in his hand, given to him by California's governor, Gray Davis, at a party at Paramount studios. The image, which popped up on cable news and ''Entertainment Tonight,'' was almost too telling: Bill Clinton is a once-in-a-lifetime political performer, at home at this Hollywood convention.</p>
