        <p>The 50-meter freestyle is the most elemental of all swimming races, the closest thing to a track sprint, a crouched start, a frothing slice of arms, an urgent white-water finish. Most of the time, there is room to breathe only once.</p>
        <p>When he reached the wall first in a foaming rush tonight, Gary Hall Jr. had set an American record of 21.76 seconds and had rejuvenated a career that had been smudged since the 1996 Atlanta Olympics by a marijuana-related suspension and had been threatened by diabetes.</p>
        <p>The 6-foot-6-inch, 205-pound Hall shaved five-hundredths of a second off the previous American record of 21.81 set a decade ago by Tom Jager.</p>
        <p>Tonight's victory represented a victory over personal obstacles, but it also represented the triumph of individualism by a free-spirited swimmer over the sometimes obsessive conformity in the sport.</p>
        <p>Hall's winning time was the second fastest in history in the 50 freestyle. Next month at the Olympics in Sydney, Australia, Hall is again expected to challenge the current Olympic champion, Aleksandr Popov of Russia, who set the world record of 21.64 in June. Hall, 25, of Phoenix, finished second to Popov in both the 50 and 100 freestyles at the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta. Popov's record, however, was set with an open lane between swimmers, alleviating turbulence in the water. There will be a swimmer in all eight lanes at the Olympics.</p>
        <p>Hall's training partner, Anthony Ervin, 19, of Valencia, Calif., finished second to Hall tonight in 21.80, the third fastest time in history. By finishing fifth on Sunday in the 100 freestyle, Ervin had become the first swimmer of African-American descent to make the Olympic team.</p>
        <p>The two freestylers are training this summer in Phoenix with their coach Mike Bottom, who stresses individual instinct and creativity over group compliance, a style that has turned swimming on its conventional head. For instance, when he began coaching Hall five years ago, Bottom required that the swimmer first have his father buy him a guitar. Tonight, both Hall and Ervin arrived on the pool deck wearing black, hooded robes, and they flexed and gestured like heavyweight champions when introduced. Sometimes they punch the speed bag during workouts.</p>
        <p>The group also uses cutting-edge nutrition, with a protein bent, that closely follows the diet of Fusaichi Pegasus, the winner of the Kentucky Derby, Bottom said. The swimmers refer to their energy bars as ''horse bars.'' So far they have not eaten any hay.</p>
        <p>''Unfortunately, it has been propagated that coaches know everything and swimmers don't know anything,'' said Bottom, a former Olympian who coaches Ervin, a collegiate freestyle champion, at the University of California at Berkeley. ''That's not true. If you listen to your swimmers, you'll learn something.''</p>
        <p>In the women's 200-meter backstroke, Lea Loveless Maurer of Crestwood, N.Y., the American record-holder in the 100 backstroke, held the lead for 150 meters, but she went out too fast and faded to fifth in 2:15.12. Amanda Adkins, 23, of Athens, Ga., finished far ahead to win in 2:12.97. Lindsay Benko, 23, of Elkhart, Ind., took second in 2:13.29.</p>
        <p>Ian Crocker, 17, of Portland, Me., closed ferociously to win the men's 100-meter butterfly in 52.78 seconds, edging out Tommy Hannan, 20, of Baltimore, who was second in 52.81.</p>
        <p>The Olympic champion Brooke Bennett, 20, of Plant City, Fla., drew far ahead in the women's 800-meter freestyle to win in 8:23.92, a personal best. Kaitlin Sandeno, 17, of Lake Forest, Calif., qualified for her third Olympic event by taking second in 8:28.61. Dara Torres swam the fastest time in the semifinals of the women's 50-meter freestyle in 24.93 seconds, ahead of the Olympic champion Amy Van Dyken, who swam 25.11. The final is Wednesday.</p>
        <p>In the men's 50-meter freestyle, Hall has again succeeded when many others were convinced that he would fail. His career has been a roller-coaster ride since Atlanta. In early 1998, Hall tested positive for marijuana and was suspended from competition for three months. At the time, swimming's world governing body, FIFA, announced that Hall had previously tested positive at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. He had not been punished because marijuana was not officially banned at the time.</p>
        <p>On March 21, 1999, Hall learned from doctors that he had diabetes. He was forced to alter his junk-food diet and he now injects himself up to eight times a day with insulin shots, sometimes during training or just before races.</p>
        <p>''I feel great, but you have to deal with all the time, because any time you eat or exercise, it can spiral out of control,'' Hall said.</p>
        <p>He is the son of Gary Hall, a three-time Olympian who was the flag bearer for the American team at the 1976 Summer Games in Montreal. The father gave an opening speech before Sunday's competition and wrapped himself in the flag in jingoistic remarks about America's dominance at those Games. Gary Hall Jr. is much more iconoclastic.</p>
        <p>He wore leather pants on the pool deck and was a Deadhead, devoted to music of the Grateful Dead, at the 1996 trials. Tonight, he showed up for the 50-meter freestyle finals with his black, hooded robe covering red, white and blue boxing shorts, left over from a benefit he had attended for Muhammad Ali.</p>
        <p>He was more reserved than he had been Sunday before the 100-meter finals, when he began punching the air after revealing the boxing trunks. He finished second then, flooring any doubt that he had resuscitated his career sufficiently to make another Olympic team.</p>
        <p>Some have seen this irreverence and his often indifferent training as signs of a lack of determination in a sport that demands exhaustive preparation. Hall admits that he trains when he wants. In the ready room before the 100 freestyle at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, Hall said that his nemesis, Popov, looked at him and said, ''I'm going to kick your Yankee'' behind, because ''you're soft.''</p>
        <p>Don Talbot, coach of the Australian Olympic swim team, discussed the frustration that coaches sometimes feel about Hall, and his unfulfilled potential, before tonight's race.</p>
        <p>''He's grown up in the shadow of great performances,'' Talbot said, referring to Hall's father, a two-time Olympic medalist. ''I don't think we've seen his best yet. You may never see it because of his personality. I don't want to say bad boy. Difficult. We tend to compartmentalize people and put them in a box.'' Who's to say that what he's doing isn't what's making him great?''</p>
