        <p>Further straining his relationship with State Education Commissioner Richard P. Mills, Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy filed court papers yesterday that forcefully blamed Mr. Mills for the shortage of certified teachers in the city's 99 lowest-performing schools.</p>

        <p>Further straining his relationship with State Education Commissioner Richard P. Mills, Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy filed court papers yesterday that forcefully blamed Mr. Mills for the shortage of certified teachers in the city's 99 lowest-performing schools.</p>
        <p>Specifically, Mr. Levy's lawyers charged, Mr. Mills has not made good on promises to provide financial incentives for certified teachers who agree to work in hard-to-staff schools; to improve programs at teaching colleges and attract strong candidates into those programs; and to finance a ''master teacher'' program, which would help outstanding teachers get advanced degrees and counsel less experienced teachers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy was responding to a lawsuit that Mr. Mills filed on Aug. 1 to block the city from placing uncertified teachers in the 99 schools, designated as failing by the state. Mr. Mills went to court because the city had violated a new state policy that requires that only certified teachers be hired for those schools after September 1999.</p>
        <p>In his lawsuit, Mr. Mills is demanding that the city not only replace nearly 600 unlicensed teachers assigned to the 99 schools last year, but also fill any additional vacancies with certified teachers. Mr. Levy has tried to comply by introducing several recruitment initiatives, including an alternative route toward obtaining certification and an increase in the starting salaries that private and parochial school teachers can earn if they transfer into the failing  schools.</p>
        <p>With Mr. Mills judging those actions inadequate, lawyers for Mr. Levy filed papers yesterday in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn that denounced the commissioner's demand as ''arbitrary and capricious,'' not to mention ''unreasonable and irrational.'' Since the State Board of Regents created the ban on uncertified teachers in failing schools, they said, it is the state's responsibility to find enough certified teachers to replace them.</p>
        <p>''The Regents policy is a call to action for the state and the commissioner to drastically increase the pool of qualified teachers in New York State,'' Daniel McCray, a lawyer for the city who is representing Mr. Levy, wrote in the court papers. ''However, the commissioner and the state have not come close to fulfilling their obligations.''</p>
        <p>In addition to failing to provide a financial incentive for certified teachers who agree to work in hard-to-staff schools and taking other promised steps, Mr. McCray wrote, the state had failed to fulfill its pledge to ''initiate a campaign to encourage students to choose teaching as a profession.''</p>
        <p>Alan Ray, a spokesman for Mr. Mills, declined to comment on Mr. Levy's response to the lawsuit. He said the state would formally respond on Tuesday, in a hearing before Justice Joseph F. Bruno.</p>
        <p>But in recent weeks, Mr. Mills and his aides have repeatedly said that the state has not only poured money into teacher recruitment, but also removed barriers that had hindered New York City's recruitment efforts. For example, the Board of Regents voted last month to allow alternative certification programs. And in March, the board voted to allow credentialed teachers from most other states to begin teaching here immediately rather than waiting to pass New York's certification exams.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mills has maintained that the disproportionate number of uncertified teachers working in New York City's failing schools is the biggest obstacle to their improvement. But Mr. Levy, who faces the task of bringing the city's 1,100 public schools in line with the tough new standards he championed as a state regent, also has to face an array of local constituencies -- especially the powerful teachers' union, which has insisted that it will not allow Mr. Levy to force veteran certified teachers to transfer into failing schools against their will.</p>
        <p>But pressure from the union is apparently not the only factor in Mr. Levy's refusal to take drastic measures. The court papers suggest that he is philosophically opposed to the idea of forcing teachers to work in troubled schools, especially now that the system is struggling to attract new teachers and retain older ones who are nearing retirement age.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy's lawyers also suggested in the court papers that uncertified teachers are not necessarily incompetent. They said that in recent years, the city has invested $50 million in on-the-job training for uncertified teachers in the 99 failing schools. The training has emphasized teaching practices ''tailored for at-risk children,'' the court papers say.</p>
        <p>''Many newly certified teachers fresh out of school, or veteran teachers who have worked only in high-performing schools, would not be familiar with these teaching methodologies,'' Mr. McCray wrote.</p>
        <p>Student test scores have sharply improved in some of the schools, even though they have large numbers of uncertified teachers, Mr. McCray wrote. In particular, he pointed to P.S. 212 in the Bronx, where the percentage of students who scored in the lowest category decreased to 19.1 last year, from 53.2 percent in 1998. Yet nearly 40 percent of the teachers at that school are uncertified, according to the court papers.</p>
        <p>The court papers suggested that Mr. Mills was being unrealistic in rigidly enforcing the new policy in light of the current teacher shortage. The ban on uncertified teachers in failing schools even extends to those in the Teach for America program, many of whom graduated from ''the finest universities,'' the court papers say. Teach for America places recent college graduates in urban schools.</p>
        <p>In a separate affidavit, Mr. Levy listed 13 recruiting strategies that the school board had used in recent months in an attempt to comply with the policy, and suggested there was nothing more that he could do.</p>
