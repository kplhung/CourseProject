        <p>THE chairman of Ernst &amp; Young, a major accounting firm that has been supporting the Securities and Exchange Commission effort to tighten rules on auditor independence, said yesterday that the S.E.C.'s rule proposal goes too far and would create too much uncertainty about what activities were permitted.</p>
        <p>In a speech to the American Accounting Association meeting in Philadelphia, Phil Laskaway of Ernst &amp; Young said the proposed rule ''would make it impossible'' for audit firms ''to enter into strategic alliances or joint ventures, including with companies that are not audit clients.'' Such allegiances are needed, he said, because they help the firms gain expertise to do their jobs better.</p>
        <p>But he added that he still hoped the S.E.C. would amend the proposal in a way that would be acceptable. He suggested a rule might ban firms from performing large amounts of internal audit work for audit clients, but still allow smaller tasks to be performed. The S.E.C. has said it fears that outside auditors might be reluctant to question internal auditing work if it was done by people employed by the same accounting firm.</p>
        <p>Mr. Laskaway added that a new rule could provide for disclosure of the total audit fee and the total fee for other services to the company, to help investors ascertain whether there was reason to be concerned about the auditor's independence.</p>
        <p>No disclosure is now required on nonaudit services, a fact that makes it impossible to even begin to compile statistics that would indicate whether audits that prove to be faulty are more or less likely to involve companies that used their auditing firms for other services.</p>
        <p>Ernst &amp; Young and PricewaterhouseCoopers, each of which is getting out of consulting in any case, have been relatively supportive of the S.E.C. effort, while the other three major firms -- KPMG, Arthur Andersen and Deloitte &amp; Touche -- have been harshly critical. The S.E.C. hopes that it can find a rule that the two firms will support, and Mr. Laskaway's speech indicated that effort has not yet borne fruit. If the S.E.C. is going to pass a rule that has support from major auditing firms, it will probably have to tone down the proposal substantially.</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview after the speech, Mr. Laskaway said, ''I tried to lay out a blueprint that will get something done.'' He added, ''I have hopes this will be resolved.''</p>
        <p>Lynn Turner, the S.E.C.'s chief accountant, said the commission would consider the suggestions and voiced the hope that other firms would also make suggestions for a rule that would ''insure that investors will continue to trust the numbers.''</p>
        <p>Representatives of the other big firms have indicated they will fight the rule, whose most significant aspect would be to ban accounting firms from doing certain types of consulting work for audit clients, and have so far shown little indication they want to reach a compromise.</p>
        <p>One effort under way, according to some people who have talked to Congressional aides, is to persuade Congress to attach a rider to an appropriations bill in the current session. Such a rider would bar the S.E.C. from acting on the rule before February, by which time the opponents hope that a new president will have appointed a new S.E.C. chairman who will drop the idea. It is not clear if such a legislative move will be made.</p>
        <p>In his speech, Mr. Laskaway said ''heightened scrutiny of auditor independence'' had led some clients to demand that auditors not perform other services for the company. He said it would be good ''if the S.E.C. could provide greater certainty'' regarding what was permitted. That would give firms the ''opportunity to move forward with our clients'' and ''would also hopefully restore civility between the profession and the regulators.''</p>
        <p>But he said that the proposed rule, by adopting four ''overriding principles'' regarding independence, would create too much uncertainty. Such principles should be modified, he said, if they are kept at all.</p>
