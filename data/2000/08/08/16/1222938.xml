        <p>It was a scandal that riveted Swinging Sixties London and left behind a tantalizing question that has gone unanswered for nearly 40 years. At its center was Margaret, Duchess of Argyll, a rich and seductive society beauty who inspired Cole Porter's ''You're the Top.''</p>
        <p>In what was then the longest and costliest divorce proceeding in British history, she was accused by her husband, the duke, of leaving him behind in his dark baronial castles in Scotland and going on a high-kicking romp through the salons of London during which she took, by his count, 88 lovers, including cabinet members, Hollywood actors and members of the royal family.</p>
        <p>The duke knew this, he said, because he had stolen her diaries from her desk drawer and also found compromising pictures. Submitted to the Edinburgh court but kept from public view, the photographs reportedly showed a naked man gratifying himself and pictured her, dressed in nothing but three strands of pearls, performing a sex act on a naked man in the mirrored gilt and silver bathroom of her Mayfair apartment.</p>
        <p>The pictures, taken with a Polaroid camera, showed the man only from the neck down. It led the judge in the case, Lord Wheatley, to identify him as ''the man without a head'' and prompted British gossips ever since to ask, ''Who was the headless man?''</p>
        <p>For years, the two most prominent suspects have been Winston Churchill's son-in-law, Duncan Sandys, who was defense secretary in the government of Harold Macmillan, and the American actor and society figure Douglas Fairbanks Jr. A television documentary shown on Britain's Channel 4 this week came up with what it called the ''definitive answer'' -- it was both of them.</p>
        <p>The four-year divorce proceeding had magnified significance for the British public because it revealed fresh evidence of upper-class decadence during the same months in 1963 that the scandal involving the war minister, John Profumo, was unfolding. Mr. Profumo had to resign in disgrace when it emerged he lied to Parliament about his relationship with the call girl Christine Keeler.</p>
        <p>The duchess was found to have committed adultery with four men by the judge, Lord Wheatley, who, in a 50,000-word report that took more than three hours to read, pilloried her as a high-class harlot. ''She is a highly sexed woman who has ceased to be satisfied with normal sexual activities and has started to indulge in disgusting sexual activities to gratify a debased sexual appetite that can only be satisfied by a number of men,'' he said. He added, ''Her attitude to the sanctity of marriage was what moderns would call enlightened but which in plain language was wholly immoral.''</p>
        <p>There have been books, biographies, articles and a full-length opera devoted to her since, but she died in 1993 without ever revealing her secret. Both Mr. Fairbanks, who died in May, and Lord Duncan-Sandys, who died in 1987, always denied involvement.</p>
        <p>The television documentary, titled ''Secret History: The Duchess and the Headless Man,'' said the man shown in the pictures was in fact two men.</p>
        <p>Peter Jay, later to be British ambassador to Washington but then a Treasury official assisting in the official investigation, told how the senior judge leading the inquiry, Lord Denning, proved that Mr. Fairbanks was one of them. He deliberately invited the five principal suspects to his office to discuss the matter, obliging them to sign in on an official guest book. Each signature was examined by a graphologist to find the match with the ''thinking of you'' caption found on the snapshots.</p>
        <p>Lord Denning, who died last year at the age of 100, concluded that it was Mr. Fairbanks but did not say so in the report, which had been commissioned to find out only whether there was a security lapse. He reported back simply that there was none and left it at that, Mr. Jay said.</p>
        <p>A friend and confidant of the duchess, Paul Vaughan, suggested to the program that Mr. Sandys was the headless figure in a separate Polaroid shot in the bathroom. ''She did say to me quite clearly that 'of course sweetie,' the only Polaroid camera in the country at this time had been lent to the Ministry of Defense. If that wasn't running a flag up the pole, I don't know what was. She wanted someone to know.''</p>
        <p>Lord Deedes, then a minister in the Macmillan government and later the editor of The Daily Telegraph, recalled that Lord Duncan-Sandys protested his innocence at the time but threatened to resign from the cabinet on principle. He was persuaded out of it when he realized that, coming at the time of the Profumo scandal, that could have brought the government down.</p>
        <p>The only child of a self-made Scottish textile millionaire, the young Margaret Whigham, with green eyes and magnolia-pale skin, took London by storm in 1931, becoming debutante of the year and companion to a series of eligible men. In 1933 she married an American stockbroker and amateur golfer named Charles Sweeny in a London wedding that drew 2,000 onlookers.</p>
        <p>During the 30's she reached the social heights, becoming a lively participant at parties, balls, charity matinees and royal receptions and London's most photographed and publicized upper-class beauty. An enraptured Cole Porter wrote:</p>
        <p>You're the nimble tread of the feet of Fred Astaire.</p>
        <p>You're Mussolini,</p>
        <p>You're Mrs. Sweeny,</p>
        <p>You're Camembert.''</p>
        <p>She was divorced from Mr. Sweeny in 1947, and in 1951 became the wife of the 11th Duke of Argyll, chief of the Clan Campbell and hereditary master of the royal household in Scotland. The marriage ended with the spectacular divorce in 1963, and he died in 1973.</p>
        <p>Even as her life went into decline, Margaret Argyll remained a favorite subject of gossip columnists who tracked her growing feuds with her family, landlords, servants, bankers and biographers. In the 1970's she was forced to open up her Mayfair house to paying visitors until in 1978 she was obliged to sell it and move into an apartment in the Grosvenor House hotel. She was evicted from there in 1990 for unpaid rent and placed in the nursing home where three years later, penniless and alone, she suffered a fall in her bathroom that broke her neck, killing her.</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 25, 2000, Friday  An article on Aug. 16 about new information on a 1960's sex scandal in Britain that involved the Duchess of Argyll misattributed a lyric written for ''You're the Top,'' the Cole Porter song inspired by the duchess. The lyric, with a reference to Mussolini, was written by P. G. Wodehouse for the 1935 London production of ''Anything Goes.'' The lyricist was not Porter.</p>
