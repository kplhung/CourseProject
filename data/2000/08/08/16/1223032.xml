        <p>Re ''U.S. Child Poverty Rate Fell as Economy Grew, but Is Above 1979 Level'' (news article, Aug. 11):</p>
        <p>You report that elected officials and advocates for children cite low wages and higher costs for child care and living as primary reasons for the stubborn persistence of child poverty. Yet not mentioned is what many scholars view as the main reason: continuing high rates of unwed childbearing and divorce.</p>
        <p>Children in mother-headed homes are five times more likely to be poor than children in married-couple homes. About 60 percent of all poor children today live in one-parent homes. Scholars have found that the explosion of one-parent homes in the 1970's and 1980's accounts for almost all of the rise in child poverty during this period. Unless we turn around the trend of family fragmentation, child poverty rates in the United States are likely to remain high.</p>
