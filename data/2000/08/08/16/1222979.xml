        <p>Before the recent spate of publicity about deadly accidents involving Firestone tires, Tab Turner, a Little Rock, Ark., lawyer, rarely received more than a call or two a month seeking his advice about legal claims related to defective tires.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Turner, who has spent nearly all his time the last few years on tire problems or litigation stemming from rollover accidents involving sport utility vehicles, is no longer driving in the legal slow lane.</p>
        <p>''We got 330 calls and e-mails on Monday,'' said Mr. Turner, mostly from consumers angry about delays in having their tires replaced. ''We're getting overwhelmed.''</p>
        <p>Lawyers say that the clamor for advice and, in some cases, action against Bridgestone/Firestone, which makes the tires, and the Ford Motor Company, whose Explorer sport utility vehicles figure in most of the reported accidents, seems unlikely to abate soon.</p>
        <p>Indeed, while tire manufacturers and automakers have rarely had to worry about anything beyond a steady trickle of lawsuits stemming from tire failures, they are now attracting the attention of big-name class-action law firms responding to widespread anger at the recall plans.</p>
        <p>The class-action firms -- which have honed their skills in multibillion-dollar battles with drug companies, asbestos manufacturers and the tobacco industry -- have far more resources than Mr. Turner, Bruce R. Kaster of Florida, Thomas Basse of Arizona and other personal-injury lawyers that tire makers like Firestone usually face.</p>
        <p>Unlike the cases brought in cases over deaths and injuries in individual traffic accidents, some of which have resulted in six-figure settlements, the class-action suits are focused on the claims of drivers who have yet to suffer any tire failure.</p>
        <p>One by one, such claims are too small for personal-injury lawyers to pursue, but together they could cost Bridgestone/Firestone and Ford hundreds of millions of dollars beyond the expenses of the recall. Last week, Firestone's Japanese parent, the Bridgestone Corporation, said it would set aside $350 million to cover recall costs, and its stock has plunged 29 percent this month amid news about the problem tires.</p>
        <p>The recall that Firestone announced last week -- for all 15-inch ATX and ATX II tires, and for Wilderness AT tires made at its plant in Decatur, Ill. -- focused first on Southern and Western states where the vast majority of accidents involving the tires had been reported.</p>
        <p>But the class-action complaints argue that millions of drivers who are being asked to wait a year or more are being damaged by that plan.</p>
        <p>Some of the class actions demand that Bridgestone/Firestone immediately replace tires in all states, or else cover the costs of consumers who want to switch to other brands.</p>
        <p>Some seek compensation for the emotional stress to drivers or the diminished resale value of vehicles that have been equipped with the tires being recalled.</p>
        <p>Bridgestone/Firestone moved yesterday to meet some of the demands, announcing that it would reimburse customers up to $100 a tire for tires purchased since Jan. 1 in order to replace the recalled tires.</p>
        <p>The company said it would offer the same payment to those who have bought tires from other makers to replace Firestones since it announced the recall last Wednesday.</p>
        <p>In addition to complaints about the phased recall, the companies face legal complaints over their decision to limit the recall to 15-inch tires when some larger tires have already been recalled in other countries.</p>
        <p>Ford, which is named in some but not all of the suits, said yesterday that the recall had ''nothing to do with the litigation and that the class-action lawyers were trying to capitalize on a situation they have no influence over.''</p>
        <p>A Firestone spokesman said the company was too busy working on the recall to comment on litigation.</p>
        <p>Personal-injury lawyers like Mr. Turner are not yet paying much attention to the phased-recall plan, but that could change if delays replacing the tires lead to accidents.</p>
        <p>''I've had people trying to get their tires replaced tell me that dealers say it will take three months to catch up with the demand,'' said Mr. Dasse, a lawyer in Scottsdale, Ariz., which is in the first group of states promised replacement tires. ''You are going to see catastrophic failures in the next few months.''</p>
        <p>He said the companies could be exposing themselves to further legal claims if Firestone continued supplying tires to Ford to keep Explorer production lines up, instead of meeting the recall needs first.</p>
        <p>The tire maker said yesterday that satisfying customer concerns was its first priority, but added that it was also continuing to send tires to Ford.</p>
        <p>Such seeming conflicts are likely to figure prominently in the legal battles to come, lawyers say.</p>
        <p>They wonder whether these might finally lead to cracks in the united front that the longtime partners -- Firestone began supplying tires to Ford in 1907 -- have presented in lawsuits against them.</p>
        <p>They typically argue that blowouts were caused by poor maintenance, underinflation or road debris. The companies have resisted efforts by plaintiffs' lawyers to gather and share evidence, arguing that tires and vehicles differ so much that each case is essentially unlike any other. Most cases end in settlements in which the defendants demand that the records be sealed.</p>
        <p>''Tires fail for all kinds of reasons,'' said Susan Dwyer, a New York lawyer who has defended such suits for 20 years but is not involved in cases related to the recalled Bridgestone/Firestone tires. ''That's why cars come with backups, and it's the only component like that.''</p>
        <p>But the Firestone case is producing such a large number of similar complaints -- details of which are emerging as Ford and the United States government analyze accident data -- that plaintiffs' lawyers are anticipating more chances to cooperate.</p>
        <p>''The issue is no longer whether there is a problem,'' Mr. Turner said. ''It's now an issue of what they knew and when they knew it.''</p>
