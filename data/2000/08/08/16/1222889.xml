        <p>The British art scene is so heady with hype, gimmickry and self-promotion these days that it comes as something of a relief to discover the long-lost world of kinetic art at the Hayward Gallery on the south bank of the Thames.</p>
        <p>True, not very long ago, from the 1920's to the early 1980's, moving art was also trendy. Yet today it seems dated, rooted in another age. In presenting ''Force Fields: Phases of the Kinetic,'' the Hayward has dared to be uncool.</p>
        <p>Still, the exhibition, which was seen last spring at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Barcelona and  will run here through Sept. 17, is more than just educational for the young and nostalgic for the less young. It offers a journey through a world in which time and space are redefined by the simple (and at times complex) addition of movement. It is funny, clever, bizarre, hallucinatory and strangely uplifting. But it is not quiet: movement in art also produces bangs and bongs galore.</p>
        <p>In selecting some 100 works by 40 artists, the show's curator, Guy Brett, has interpreted the term ''kinetic art'' to suit his purposes. Although he does not include video or electronic art, which does move, he includes paintings, drawings and sculptures that do not move or, rather, do so only metaphorically. The heart of the show is nonetheless dedicated to wonderful contraptions that turn, stretch, tremble, swing and float.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brett sees the exhibition as an opportunity to reawaken public interest in the ''language of movement'' and, above all, to lift kinetic art from what he considers undeserved obscurity. Museums display little kinetic art, he laments, while, by definition, still photographs of moving objects published in books and magazines cannot capture the most distinctive feature of this work.</p>
        <p>''To this impoverished visibility,'' he wrote in a catalog essay, ''must be added the tendency to treat the historical phenomenon known as Kinetic Art as a kind of sideshow, or entertainment, in 20th-century art, not to be treated with the same high seriousness as, say, Minimal Art, Conceptual Art, or for that matter Pop Art.</p>
        <p>''True, much of the work produced was pedestrian and boring, but that is true of any movement, and the result has been that the radical implications of the best work for the evolution of art have been ignored.''</p>
        <p>Given the rare occasion to present kinetic art in two large galleries in two major cities, then, Mr. Brett has gone for the best. The show opens with ''Rotary Glass Plates,'' a precursor of Op Art made by Marcel Duchamp with Man Ray in 1925, in which four blades spin on a shaft to create the illusion of a solid circle decorated with circular lines. Also from the 1920's is Laszlo Moholy-Nagy's magical ''Light-Space Modulator,'' a ''spatial kaleidoscope,'' in his words, in which two arc lights create silhouettes of a rotating mechanical object that is itself alive with moving parts.</p>
        <p>Nearby are three of Alexander Calder's earliest mobiles, ''A White Ball, a Black Ball'' and two ''Untitled,'' delicate as ever, gently stirred by the movement of visitors, defining space but also representing space.</p>
        <p>''From the beginning of my abstract work,'' Calder wrote, ''even when it might not have seemed so, I felt there was no better model to choose than the universe. Spheres of different sizes, densities, colors and volumes, floating in space, traversing clouds, sprays of water, currents of air, viscosities and odors of the greatest variety and disparity.''</p>
        <p>If, as Mr. Brett proposes, artists as well as scientists create ''models of the universe,'' two of the artists in the show built theirs with outside assistance. The inspiration for Henri Michaux's ''Mescaline Drawings'' is self-evident, while Wols (the name adopted by Alfred Wolfgang Schulze) etched under the influence of old-fashioned liquor. James Whitney's hand-drawn animated films ''Yanta'' and ''Lapis,'' made in the 1950's and 60's, take their cue from yoga and Eastern philosophy to create what resembles an LSD-induced cosmos.</p>
        <p>Op Art resurfaces in Francois  Morellet's so-called ''mesh'' paintings, with tiny designs endlessly repeated to the point that they move with the eye. Jesus Rafael Soto and Pol Bury both capture movement in their paintings, but also, more realistically, in their installations. Mr. Soto's ''Penetrable'' is a dense forest of dangling plastic filaments through which visitors can walk; Mr. Bury's kinetic works include ''Punctuation (White Dots)'' in which a clutch of painted nylon threads sprouting from a wooden board slowly rotate.</p>
        <p>Two artists in particular, though, show why the 1950's and 1960's were the heyday of kinetic art. Jean Tinguely's approach was to satirize the consumer society by building immense sculptures of industrial detritus, all set into comical and noisy motion by a series of electric motors. Indeed, these are works that only make sense when they come to life. Of the five Tinguelys in this show, ''Baluba XII,'' made in 1961-62, captures on a small scale what he later tried to achieve in his later monumental sculptures.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Takis, now 75, has long tapped electromagnetic energy, using this force to create a cosmos of metal objects in suspended animation, as with his ''Telemagnetic Sculptures'' and ''Ballet Magnetique,'' which are among 23 of his pieces on display here. One charming work is ''Musical'' (1974), in which three foot-long metal ''needles'' hang from a board and are drawn by magnetic impulses to strike horizontal metal wires. The resulting bongs echo through the gallery.</p>
        <p>These compete with the whacks emanating from Len Lye's ''Blade,'' in which a trembling vertical steel blade is repeatedly hit by a wooden hammer. An almost otherworldly sound is created by his ''Universe,'' a large band of polished steel resting on a magnetized base that bends and lurches in response to interrupted magnetic impulses.</p>
        <p>The idea of the cosmos becomes even more real for visitors entering Gianni Colombo's ''Elastic Space,'' a large dark cube crossed by vertical and horizontal strings that are pulled in different directions to disrupt all sense of place.</p>
        <p>The show also includes nonmoving works by artists like Yves Klein, Sol LeWitt, Georges Vantongerloo, Sergio Camargo and Lygia Clark as well as more orthodox kinetic pieces by Gerhard von Graevenitz, Dieter Roth, Grazia Varisco and Liliane Lijn.</p>
        <p>Yet if ''Force Fields'' inevitably looks backward, the youngest living artist in the show, 58-year-old David Medalla of the Philippines, is clearly immune to what is considered fashionable. Among his works on display is ''Cloud Gates,'' a large installation  that stands on an outside terrace. This work creates large bubble clouds that catch the wind and float away over London. It is proof enough that something is moving in the Hayward.</p>
        <p>ARTS ABROAD  Correction:  August 17, 2000, Thursday  A picture credit yesterday with an Arts Abroad article about kinetic art at the Hayward Gallery in London misstated the location of the Van Abbemuseum, which supplied the illustration of Moholy-Nagy's ''Light-Space Modulator.'' The site, Eind hoven, is in the Netherlands, not in Sweden.</p>
