        <p>In the face of seemingly intractable separatist and sectarian conflicts of his own, President Abdurrahman Wahid plunged into Middle East politics today, offering a complicated formula he said could resolve the deadlock over the status of Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>''It's an attempt to break the ice,'' Mr. Wahid told reporters, referring to the collapse last month of the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks at Camp David. ''If they invite Indonesia to participate in the discussions, that will be fine.''</p>
        <p>The overture was the latest surprise move by the unpredictable president, coming in the middle of a fast-paced game of domestic power politics in which he is battling a wide array of opponents in a special parliamentary session.</p>
        <p>He offered his power-sharing ideas after meeting here on Monday with former Prime Minister Shimon Peres of Israel, an old friend. Mr. Wahid plans to meet on Wednesday with the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, who is on a tour of the region.</p>
        <p>Presenting his own analysis of the Camp David talks, Mr. Wahid said the problem was that ''only one kind of sovereignty was discussed'' for Jerusalem, which both Israel and the Palestinians claim as their capital.</p>
        <p>''In my view we'd better differentiate between administrative sovereignty, which will be in the hands of the Israelis, and political sovereignty,'' which he said would be under control of a seven-member committee.</p>
        <p>Such a committee, he said, would be made up of Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, the Palestinian entity and Israel as well as the United Nations.</p>
        <p>At Camp David, Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel had offered the Palestinians limited control over Arab areas of East Jerusalem, which Israel occupied in the 1967 Middle East war. But Mr. Arafat demanded full sovereignty.</p>
        <p>Since becoming president 10 months ago, Mr. Wahid has taken a particular interest in foreign affairs -- which is not shared by most people here -- traveling to 30 countries, sometimes on the spur of the moment and without a clear agenda.</p>
        <p>Last week, under pressure from his opponents in Parliament, he agreed to hand over some of his day-to-day duties to his vice president, Megawati Sukarnoputri. He said that would free him to concentrate more on foreign policy and suggested that Indonesia could play a greater role in mediating international conflicts.</p>
        <p>His approach to Indonesia's own separatist and religious conflicts, including recent violent episodes in the Maluku Islands, has been one of mediation and conciliation rather than confrontation. In some cases his efforts have had only limited success; in others they have been disastrous failures.</p>
        <p>Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation with 210 million people, has not played a significant role in the Middle East in the past. It has never recognized Israel and has supported the Palestinians.</p>
        <p>As one of his first acts as president, Mr. Wahid defied public sentiment here by opening trade relations with Israel. Following widespread criticism, he said formal diplomatic relations would have to wait until the peace efforts with the Palestinians are complete.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wahid signaled his intention to become involved in Middle Eastern politics on Saturday, when he called for an end to the trade embargo that was imposed on Iraq after the Persian Gulf war in 1991.</p>
