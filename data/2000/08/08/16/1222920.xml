        <p>Durk I. Jager lasted 17 months at the helm of Procter &amp; Gamble, resigning last month after the shortest tenure of any chief executive in the company's 163-year history. The board of Mattel asked for the resignation of the company's leader, Jill E. Barad, this year after only three years. M. Douglas Ivester, after years of being groomed for Coca-Cola's top job, quit in February after two years in it.</p>
        <p>The evidence seems compelling that chief executives at America's largest companies have less staying power than they did just a few years ago. The stock market is far more volatile than it used to be, management experts say, and directors punish poor results swiftly.</p>
        <p>But what everybody believes about the careers of chief executives, at least at the nation's largest companies, is probably wrong. A new study has put a kink in the widely held conventional wisdom, concluding that not much changed in the second half of the 1990's. If anything, tenure actually lengthened.</p>
        <p>Between the beginning of 1995 and the start of 2000, the average tenure of leaders at 65 large companies rose one year, to 8.3 years, according to research by SCA Consulting, a New York management consulting firm. Looked at another way, half the chief executives in 1995 served more than six years, half less. In 2000, the median length of service is the same.</p>
        <p>The results of the study have left corporate governance experts puzzled. ''It's definitely counterintuitive,'' said Michael Useem, director of the Center for Leadership and Change at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p>Donald P. Jacobs, dean of the Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern, agreed. ''I would have said it would be exactly the opposite.''</p>
        <p>And Thomas Neff, chairman of Spencer Stuart, the headhunting firm, called it surprising, saying, ''We are doing an unprecedented number of searches  right now, and I suspect others are, too.''</p>
        <p>The possible reasons for lengthened tenure are many, management analysts said. The expanding pay packages of chief executives, heavily weighted toward stock options, play a role in keeping them in their current jobs, according to a separate recent study. The bull market, particularly among blue-chip companies, has left investors and board members satisfied at many companies. And boards seem to spend more time planning succession than they once did; as a result, many end up choosing better candidates.</p>
        <p>''You could draw a lot of conclusions'' from the research, said Russell H. Miller, an SCA partner who had expected the study to document just how much tenure had dropped. ''But it probably asks more questions than it answers.''</p>
        <p>SCA's original study, released earlier this year, looked at the 50 largest companies by market capitalization. The firm recently updated the study to include those companies that fit the definition in 1995 but do not today to remove the natural bias that comes from analyzing only companies that have performed well enough to be among those with the largest capitalizations today.</p>
        <p>What seems clear from the results is that turnover among chief executives at the best-known companies has changed less in recent years than many executives, recruiters, analysts and journalists have suggested. One large reason, Mr. Miller said, may be a fact that is easy to forget in a labor market in which job-hopping among the most sought-after managers seems rife: very few jobs can match the pay, power and prestige that comes with the chief executive's chair at a major company. Most leaders will use all their political skills to hang onto their jobs and virtually none cast about for other possibilities.</p>
        <p>''Where do you go if you're the C.E.O. of I.B.M.?'' Mr. Miller asked.</p>
        <p>Of course, that bond is weaker at hundreds of smaller companies, and management experts said they thought turnover had risen at a broad cross-section of American companies the last few years. Over all, the average tenure of chief executives certainly does appear to have fallen over the course of the second half of the 20th century.</p>
        <p>A few years ago, William Ocasio, now a professor at Northwestern, compared turnover rates from 1950 to 1990 and found that they had steadily risen. In 1960, for example, about 5 percent of top executives in their fifth year on the job resigned or were fired. By 1985, the portion had increased to 15 percent. Professor Ocasio took a random sample from 2,700 industrial corporations, regardless of their size.</p>
        <p>Although no parallel statistic exists for the last five years, other research suggests that turnover has become more common recently. Two of three large companies around the world have installed a new chief executive since 1995, and almost half have made a change the last three years, according to Drake Beam Morin, the outplacement firm, which looked at 476 firms in 25 countries.</p>
        <p>Many of those changes happened because of mergers, however -- a phenomenon that says little about the behavior of executives and directors. Companies that have merged were excluded from SCA's study, Mr. Miller said.</p>
        <p>For the last year, another job placement company, Challenger Gray &amp; Christmas, has counted news reports of chief executives' departures from American companies of all sizes. The average monthly number has been 65, which most analysts said was probably significantly higher than it would have been in previous decades.</p>
        <p>But none of that changes the central conclusion from SCA's simple  study: turnover did not rise in the corner office of America's largest companies in the late 1990's.</p>
        <p>One of the defining management trends the last decade has been the gravity-defying increase in executive pay. A decade ago, chief executives of the 200 largest companies in the United States made an average of $2.8 million a year, according to a survey by Pearl Meyer &amp; Partners, a pay consulting firm in New York.</p>
        <p>By last year, that number had more than tripled, to $9.4 million.</p>
        <p>The power behind the pay explosion is stock options. By 1999, they accounted for more than half of the pay packages, or about $5 million, up from $720,000 in 1990.</p>
        <p>And the more options that executives hold, the more likely they are to have a long stay in their jobs, according to a paper presented this month at the Academy of Management's annual meeting by Maria Hasenhuttl and J. Richard Harrison, two researchers at the University of Texas at Dallas.</p>
        <p>''The packages are working to retain people,'' Mr. Miller said. By contrast, salary and bonus -- which now combine for less than a third of executive pay at big companies -- did not affect turnover, the Texas researchers found. Grants of stock actually made job changes more likely.</p>
        <p>Another recent management trend may be less likely to cause turnover than many people think. Corporate boards today include significantly more outsiders than in the past. Many companies now put only a couple of their own executives -- usually the chief executive and the top deputy -- on their boards.</p>
        <p>Corporate governance experts have praised these moves, saying that a board dominated by outsiders gives tough, independent advice and offers a broad range of perspectives. But it does not appear to be any more likely to oust a chief executive, according to Professor Ocasio. In fact, his study of 114 companies indicated that boards with more outsiders actually deposed the top executive less frequently when the company was struggling financially.</p>
        <p>Professor Ocasio suggests that insider directors know the type of detailed information that would allow them to call for a change -- and that they also may be aggressive in pushing for that change because they would move up as a result.</p>
        <p>In other words, the research says, whatever benefit the overhaul of boardrooms may has brought, it is unlikely to be endangering chief executives' jobs.</p>
        <p>But another trend would almost assuredly put chief executives in  danger: a tepid stock market. In the 1990's, the great majority of stocks rose in value. Large companies did even better than the market as a whole. And rising share prices tend to obscure conflicts between executives and board members that can cause a resignation or firing.</p>
        <p>''The excellent performance of the stock market has camouflaged a lot of poor leadership among chief executives,'' said Jeffrey E. Christian, the chairman of Christian &amp; Timbers, a search firm in Cleveland that recruited Carly S. Fiorina for Hewlett-Packard. ''My sense is that we are going to see a new period of boards becoming more critical of their C.E.O.'s.''</p>
