        <p>Pledging to avoid ''nasty'' partisan attacks on the Republican presidential nominee, Gov. George W. Bush, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut said in an interview today that he would use his convention address Wednesday night to start ''a conversation with the American people.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman said that while he would not hesitate to ''respectfully'' point out policy differences with the Republican Party, he would not play the traditional role of the vice-presidential candidate as the attack dog.</p>
        <p>''I've talked to Al about this,'' he said, ''and we're very intent on talking about progress, not partisanship. This is not going to be a campaign of personal attack.''</p>
        <p>Later he said, ''It doesn't have to be nasty; it doesn't have to be partisan. I'm going to speak from the record of Al Gore, the record of George Bush and the plans they've described.''</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, he described Mr. Bush and Dick Cheney, the Republican vice-presidential candidate, as ''decent and likable people'' who represent ''a step backward for America.''</p>
        <p>''The choices here are very clear,'' Mr. Lieberman said. ''And these choices I think will significantly affect the future of the people of this country. Government doesn't do it all, but government sets a tone, sets a direction.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman, 58, conveyed a sense of easy anticipation as he relaxed in a chair in a small room under the main convention stage. About an hour later, he made an unscheduled foray onto the floor of the convention, where he was  mobbed by photographers. He waved and blew kisses to the crowd, which responded with a delighted ovation.</p>
        <p>In the interview, he framed his role in the campaign partly in the language of transition, of helping Democrats move beyond the Clinton era.</p>
        <p>''I'm very proud of what he's accomplished,'' Mr. Lieberman said of President Clinton. ''And I feel I'm really able to work with Al Gore to continue the prosperity that he's built. But even though the Republicans seem to want to run against Bill Clinton, he's not on the ballot, and part of my role, and my opportunity here, is to sort of continue to talk about the smooth transition to keep the prosperity going.''</p>
        <p>But his first task in his speech, he said, would be to introduce himself to the American public -- ''who I am, what my values are.'' He said he also planned to reintroduce Mr. Gore to the country.</p>
        <p>''I believe in him,'' he said of Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>''I do think, certainly when I look at opinion polls, that a lot of people don't know Al Gore,'' he said. ''And I think the more they know him, the more they're going to like him. He's a person of great strength, honor and tremendously creative intellect.''</p>
        <p>Through these themes, Mr. Leiberman said he hoped to foreshadow the role he sees for himself in the campaign. By talking about his values and his faith, he said he would try to help Mr. Gore reach swing voters at the political center. By vouching for Mr. Gore's character, he would try to neutralize the effects of the White House scandals.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Lieberman is learning how difficult it can be to stay focused on those roles. In forging a reputation as a centrist Democrat, he had taken positions and made statements that are unpopular among more liberal Democrats. Today, he found himself defending his views on affirmative action and school vouchers to members of the Democratic National Committee's black caucus.</p>
        <p>But otherwise, he reveled in what he calls ''my new life,'' a life of arriving at airports past midnight and finding 25 reporters waiting, of being whisked about in motorcades as if lifted on a magic carpet, of carrying the full measure of expectation that comes from being the first Jew to be a presidential running mate on a major ticket.</p>
        <p>''It really is as if you've been touched, called,'' Mr. Lieberman said.</p>
        <p>Eight days ago he and his wife, Hadassah, awoke to reports that he had been chosen as Mr. Gore's running mate. Even now, he said, the notion comes as a sort of surreal surprise, one that had seemed beyond reach. And yet on Wednesday night, Mr. Lieberman will stand before the nation and deliver the most important speech of his life, one, he said, that he hopes a lifetime in politics has prepared him for.</p>
        <p>This morning, when he walked to the convention podium for a brief rehearsal, he grinned broadly and spread his arms wide, as if eager to embrace this strange new life.</p>
        <p>''An only-in-America moment,'' he said to a group of photographers.</p>
