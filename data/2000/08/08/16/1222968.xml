        <p>As happens so often in a Little League game, a coach's son was the hero of tonight's semifinal in the East Regional Little League Tournament at the A. Barlett Giamatti Complex.</p>
        <p>In this case, it was Albert Gonzales, son of Alberto Gonzales, the coach of a team from the South Bronx. Albert Gonzales's bases-loaded double in the last inning knocked in two runs and broke a 3-3 tie to lift the New York team to a 6-3 victory over New Jersey.</p>
        <p>The victory put New York in Thursday night's final against New Hampshire, which beat Rhode Island, 5-1, in a rescheduled quarterfinal this morning, and Connecticut, 3-2, in a semifinal tonight.</p>
        <p>The winner of Thursday's game qualifies for the eight-team Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pa., that begins on Sunday and runs through the following Saturday.</p>
        <p>Justin Bencsko, son of the New Jersey coach, Doug Bencsko, came close to being a hero himself. Bencsko, who pitched his second shutout of the tournament in New Jersey's quarterfinal victory on Monday, played center field tonight and scored the tying run in the bottom of the fifth inning.</p>
        <p>With two out, Bencsko got his third straight hit, a single to left, and when he scored on Sean Earley's double down the left-field line, the score was tied at 3-3. That blow knocked out Danny Almonte, the New York starter, whose two-run homer in the second inning gave the team from the Rolando Paulino Little League in the South Bronx a 3-1 lead.</p>
        <p>Almonte's was replaced by Jesus Hernandez, who retired four of the five batters he faced while striking out the side in the bottom of the sixth and final inning.</p>
        <p>Gonzales conceded he was thrilled when his son struck the game's key blow, but quickly added: ''I would have felt the same if anyone else on the team did it. After all, they're all like sons to me.''</p>
        <p>Young Gonzales, a shortstop who also walked twice and scored one run in four at-bats, said he had qualms when he stepped to the plate with the bases loaded in the sixth.</p>
        <p>''I was nervous,'' he said, ''but then he threw me a fastball, I hit it, and I felt great.''</p>
        <p>New Jersey, represented by Pequannock of Morris County, scored the game's first run in the first inning when Doug Jennings, the starting pitcher and leadoff batter, doubled to left, took third on a wild pitch and scored on Bencsko's first hit. New Jersey then loaded the bases with no outs, but Almonte retired the side on a forceout at the plate and two strikeouts.</p>
        <p>New York tied it in the second when Juan Almonte, Danny's brother, walked, advanced to second on a wild pitch and scored on Ramon Guzman's single to right.</p>
        <p>New York added two runs in the third when Danny Almonte hit a home run over the fence in left center after Albert Gonzales had walked.</p>
