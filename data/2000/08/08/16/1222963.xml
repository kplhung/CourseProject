        <p>Under the watchful gaze of North Korean minders, 100 families separated for the last five decades today began the arduous process of rebuilding relationships torn apart by war.</p>
        <p>In one heart-rending scene after another, mothers embraced children long given up for dead, brothers and sisters struggled to identify adults they knew until now only as children, wives steeled themselves to meet husbands long since wedded to other spouses, and vice versa.</p>
        <p>''Thank you so much for being alive!'' Hong Ghil Soon, 87, exclaimed as she embraced her daughter, Kim Ok Bae, who arrived this morning on the first North Korean plane to land on South Korean soil since 1950. ''Thank the dear leader for taking such good care of you!''</p>
        <p>The ''dear leader'' is Kim Jong Il, the North Korean leader whose surprisingly sophisticated political maneuvering underlay all the drama.  Here was a South Korean mother whose daughter was effectively kidnapped by North Korean troops during the war heaping praise on the man whose father, Kim Il Sung, led those troops and founded the totalitarian state that split her family apart, and who until recently was himself seen by the world outside as a reclusive, dictatorial oddity.</p>
        <p>The plane that brought the 100 people south today carried another 100 people north on its return trip for similar reunions. They were accompanied by some South Korean staff members, but without the mandate to monitor the reunions that the North's minders apparently had. The reunions today are the first in what South Korean officials hope will be a series of three sets of family gatherings this year.</p>
        <p>Kim Jong Il, who met with South Korean news executives last week, told them that he intended to arrange two more reunions, in September and October. Southern officials say the planning for those gatherings is already in the works.</p>
        <p>The meetings are part of a strategy, mapped out by Kim Jong Il and the South Korean president, Kim Dae Jung, in their historic meeting in June, to begin the process of reunifying the two countries by breaking down the barriers that divide their people.</p>
        <p>Already North Korea has agreed to re-establish rail links between the two countries, and last week it signed an agreement with one of South Korea's biggest conglomerates to develop a permanent meeting place for separated families at Kaesong, just north of the border.</p>
        <p>Kim Jong Il has even said he would like to find a way to allow visiting relatives to stay in each other's homes, rather than meet in convention centers and hotel rooms as they are doing now. But those taking part in these reunions clearly cared not a whit that they have become political pawns. They were simply happy to be families once again.</p>
        <p>The vast convention hall where the meetings took place today reverberated with shouts of joy and peals of happy laughter, not to mention a fair amount of relieved sobbing, as families solved longstanding mysteries and confirmed or discarded long-held suspicions.</p>
        <p>For five decades Moon Kyung Ja wondered what happened to her mother, who was thrown in jail for aiding the North Korean Army during the Korean War and was never seen again.</p>
        <p>Today she got her answer from her eldest sister, Moon Yang Ok, whom she had not seen since the war and had at times presumed dead. Their mother did not die in jail, as Moon Kyung Ja feared, but instead escaped and walked to safety in North Korea with her two oldest daughters and baby son.</p>
        <p>''Mother passed away without fulfilling her dream of seeing you,'' Moon Yang Ok told her sister while stroking her face. ''But your brother and sister are alive.''</p>
        <p>''Oh, my God, they are alive!'' Moon Kyung Ja shouted, throwing her hands in air. ''My family is alive!''</p>
        <p>Her sister hugged her hard. ''Let me see you,'' she said. ''Let me see your face. I have learned how long a day is, waiting this last week to see you.''</p>
        <p>Hopes are high that these are the first steps toward a more sweeping reconciliation, including greater economic cooperation and decreased military tension between the two countries, which are technically still at war.</p>
        <p>But how far the current thaw will go remains to be seen. North Korea was careful to arrange an insurance policy against defections, making sure that the South Koreans who have gone north will not leave until all of the North Korean family members are home.</p>
        <p>And a South Korean official said today that his country fully expected to pay the impoverished North for these reunions. Already, the South Korean government has given each family $500 to give to its visiting relatives from the North.</p>
        <p>The North Koreans who arrived today all appear to be members of the country's elite: professors, doctors, artists and the like. During interviews a few mentioned that they had been ''chosen by the dear leader'' to make the trip, suggesting that they have ties to the North Korean political hierarchy.</p>
        <p>They were in high spirits, waving and clapping as they left the plane, and seemed more affluent than their South Korean relatives had expected. Many South Koreans had bought watches to give their relatives, but many of the visitors arrived wearing nice watches. Two or three of the seven North Korean women wore exquisite -- and expensive -- han dok, traditional Korean dresses.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, some of the delegation's spit and polish seemed a bit contrived. Several men seemed to be wearing identical suits and identical ties, and none of them carried any hand luggage on the plane, in stark contrast to the South Koreans who went north nearly staggering under tote bags jammed with gifts.</p>
        <p>Questions about what the visitors from the North thought of Seoul were ignored or brushed aside, and the visitors took every opportunity to praise the dear leader and the great leader, as Kim Il Sung, the founder of North Korea, was known.</p>
        <p>Moon Yang Ok proudly showed her sister a handsome watch with ''Kim Il Sung'' written in elegant red calligraphy across its light silver face. ''I received this as an award for my academic achievements from the great leader,'' she said proudly.</p>
        <p>She teaches medicine, as does their younger brother, who was 2 when they fled for the North. ''Thanks to our great leader, we have become medical professionals and my younger brother is the leading academic at the Hamheung University School of Medicine,'' she said. ''There aren't many people like that.''</p>
        <p>She said her brother had invented a machine to treat arteriosclerosis.</p>
        <p>But others were more unsettled by the attention they received today. ''My sister seems really nervous,'' said Kim Suk Bae, whose sister, Kim Ok Bae, arrived in Seoul today. ''Whenever the men from the other side come by, the ones with badges, she keeps praising the dear leader and tells us to do the same. We feel like we have to play along, because if we don't, something bad might happen to her when she returns to her home.''</p>
        <p>Kim Ok Bae turned her head away whenever she was asked a question, so her sister answered for her. She said Kim Ok Bae left their house in September 1950 on a school trip to perform for North Korean troops. The performance was so good that the North Koreans ''recruited'' the performers to travel around and keep morale high.</p>
        <p>After the war, Kim Ok Bae became an anatomy professor, her sister said. She is married to another anatomy professor and has two children, a son who is a movie producer and a daughter who is a teacher.</p>
        <p>Her sister said Kim Ok Bae had told the family that every year on her mother's birthday, she prepared a birthday feast, set a beautiful table and celebrated by herself. ''I have lived until now with the guilt of having been a bad daughter,'' Kim Ok Bae said to her mother, Hong Ghil Soon, who is 87, when they met today.</p>
        <p>''But you've turned out wonderfully!'' her mother exclaimed.</p>
        <p>Indeed, in many cases the North Korean visitors seemed better off than their southern relatives, which is probably precisely the message Kim Jong Il wished to send. Kim Hyun Ki remembered his older brother, Kim Hyun Suk, who disappeared from school shortly after the war started, as a bright, handsome, engaging youngster.</p>
        <p>Today, Kim Hyun Suk did indeed seem to be all of those things -- and much younger than his two younger brothers. A tall man with a thick head of salt-and-pepper hair, he spoke animatedly during their meeting.</p>
        <p>''I went into the army for three years, and after that I went to college,'' he said. ''They sent me to college to study engineering, and I studied really hard, father.''</p>
        <p>He said his three children also had college degrees. No one in his South Korean family, which found it difficult to scratch out a living here once the authorities found out they had a family in the North, can make a similar statement.</p>
        <p>Kim Dong Man was not about to let his brother Kim Dong Jin forget the hard times his ideological beliefs had brought upon his family. Kim Dong Jin joined the North Korean Army after being jailed several times for his Communist beliefs.</p>
        <p>The South Korean Army then threw his father into prison because of his son's activities and confiscated all of the family's possessions, Kim Dong Man said. ''My father died because of my older brother,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Kim Dong Jin, a retired civil servant, sat silently as his brother described the family's woes. ''He still hasn't told me what he did for a living in the North,'' Kim Dong Man said. ''But he did say he lives in a 100-square-yard house, and from that I know he's wealthy.''</p>
        <p>Kim Dong Jin then broke his silence. ''I feel like a rich man today because I am able to see my family again,'' he said quietly. ''But if I would have stayed in the south, I would have died.</p>
        <p>''When I was 24 and the North Koreans took me in, all I had were my two fists. But the great leader educated me and gave me a job.''</p>
        <p>For his part, Kim Dong Man says he holds no grudges against his brother. ''Older brother told me he is sorry,'' he said. ''These tragedies happened because we lost our country to the Japanese and then fought ourselves after that. My brother was part of that. I want all of this suffering to end with my generation.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 19, 2000, Saturday  A front-page article on Wednesday about the reunion of relatives separated by the Korean War referred incorrectly to the flight that took North Koreans to Seoul. The North Korean plane was not the first to land in the South since 1950. At least one other, a warplane flown by a defector, landed there in 1996. The article also misstated the term for traditional Korean dresses worn by some of the North Korean women. It is han bok, not han dok.</p>
