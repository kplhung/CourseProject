        <p>The first night of the Democratic National Convention got more minutes on network television and pulled in more viewers, both on the networks and on the cable news channels, than did the first night of the Republican convention last month. The farewell speech by President Clinton was largely responsible for the increases.</p>
        <p>Despite Republican demands that the Democrats not receive any additional coverage, ABC, CBS and NBC devoted a total of 172 minutes more time to the Democrats on Monday night.</p>
        <p>Much of that was filled with President Clinton's address, which ran well past 11 p.m. The networks had cut off the Republican Convention at 11.</p>

        <p>The first night of the Democratic National Convention got more minutes on network television and pulled in more viewers, both on the networks and on the cable news channels, than did the first night of the Republican convention last month. The farewell speech by President Clinton was largely responsible for the increases.</p>
        <p>Despite Republican demands that the Democrats not receive any additional coverage, ABC, CBS and NBC devoted a total of 172 minutes more time to the Democrats on Monday night.</p>
        <p>Much of that was filled with President Clinton's address, which ran well past 11 p.m. The networks had cut off the Republican Convention at 11.</p>
        <p>In addition, NBC News provided coverage of the first night of the Democratic convention, but provided none the first night of the Republican gathering. But NBC is not covering Night 2 of the Democratic convention.</p>
        <p>More viewers watched the first night of the Democratic convention this year than in 1996, by a total of about 2.5 million. But Mr. Clinton did not address the convention on Night 1 that year.</p>
        <p>Among the networks, NBC and ABC both had about the same number of viewers, just under six million each, and  CBS had about 5.3 million. For the Republican gathering, ABC had about 5.9 million viewers and CBS about 5.2 million, but with NBC's absence  the difference in total viewers was sizable. About 17.2 million people watched the Democrats, while about 11 million watched the Republicans.</p>
        <p>In terms of total time, CBS had about 68 more minutes of Democratic convention coverage and ABC had 32 minutes more. NBC broadcast 72 minutes on Monday night.</p>
        <p>On cable, CNN and MSNBC clearly added viewers on Monday night, with both networks up sharply over the first night of the Republican convention.  CNN viewership was up about 50 percent, and MSNBC gained  about 20 percent.</p>
        <p>The only news outlet that showed a decrease from the Republican convention was the Fox News Channel, which lost about 40 percent of viewers.</p>
        <p>In all cases, viewership peaked during Mr. Clinton's address.</p>
