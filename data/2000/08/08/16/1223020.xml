        <p>Faced with an undercurrent of grumbling about the centrist tone of its ticket and platform, the Democratic Party devoted much of its convention today to reassuring its liberal base, sending its vice-presidential candidate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, before black delegates to declare his unequivocal support for affirmative action.</p>
        <p>''I was for affirmative action, am for affirmative action and will be for affirmative action,'' Mr. Lieberman, who has been critical of racial preference programs, told the convention's Black Caucus.

        <p>Faced with an undercurrent of grumbling about the centrist tone of its ticket and platform, the Democratic Party devoted much of its convention today to reassuring its liberal base, sending its vice-presidential candidate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, before black delegates to declare his unequivocal support for affirmative action.</p>
        <p>''I was for affirmative action, am for affirmative action and will be for affirmative action,'' Mr. Lieberman, who has been critical of racial preference programs, told the convention's Black Caucus. Immediately afterward, Representative Maxine Waters, a Los Angeles Democrat who had voiced strong doubts about Mr. Lieberman this weekend, declared that she would support him wholeheartedly.</p>
        <p>But other leading liberals continued to express doubts here today about Mr. Gore himself. ''The most important thing to me is that Gore is not emotionally in touch with the party's base,'' Mayor Willie L. Brown Jr. of San Francisco said in an interview. ''If he's smart, he'll go to a black church every Sunday from now until Election Day.''</p>
        <p>It is difficult to gauge the depth of discontent among black voters, union members and other core Democrats with the ticket and its agenda. But Mr. Gore's selection of Mr. Lieberman, a Connecticut senator who has staked out centrist positions not only on affirmative action, but also on school vouchers, military spending and Social Security, seems to have crystallized their worries that Mr. Gore is taking them for granted.</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign moved swiftly today to address these worries, dispatching two black cabinet secretaries, Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater and Labor Secretary Alexis M. Herman, and other prominent black Democrats to declare their strong support for Mr. Lieberman.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the list of convention speakers tonight was almost a who's who of leaders from the party's liberal wing, including two union presidents, a prominent environmentalist, gay rights and abortion rights leaders, former Senator Bill Bradley and the Rev. Jesse Jackson. [Page A25.]</p>
        <p>In his speech tonight, Mr. Jackson alluded to the party's fault lines, saying, ''Within our party we can fight for the right to do what's right. We can change, we can challenge, we can agree to disagree, we can agree to be agreeable. But we are family.''</p>
        <p>Discontent among core Democrats poses a potentially significant problem for Mr. Gore because black voters and union members are among the party's largest and most loyal constituencies. And while some of those voters might defect to Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate, the Democrats' greater fear is that some base voters will stay home on Election Day, making it difficult to win swing states like Michigan and Georgia.</p>
        <p>''People are saying, 'We don't see the Democrats standing for us,' '' said Senator Paul Wellstone, of Minnesota, a leader of the party's liberal wing. ''It is a hurdle to overcome. And the vice president needs to do it soon.''</p>
        <p>The Democrats' liberal speaking lineup represented a sharp contrast from the Republicans, who carefully choreographed their convention two weeks ago to keep conservative activists backstage, making it easier for their presidential nominee, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, to reach out to moderate swing voters.</p>
        <p>But many Democrats say the Republicans appeased their core voters in other ways: with the party platform, which remains staunchly conservative on issues like abortion, gay rights and military spending, and in the selection of Dick Cheney, who compiled a consistently conservative record in Congress, as the vice-presidential candidate.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Mr. Gore reached toward the political center with his selection of Mr. Lieberman, the chairman of the party's leading centrist organization, the Democratic Leadership Council. And his aides rebuffed repeated efforts by liberals to insert language into the platform calling for universal health care, cuts in defense spending, a moratorium on capital punishment and increased spending on the poor.</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign's efforts today to reassure black delegates about Mr. Lieberman's record took place in typical Democratic fashion amid public displays of discontent and ego politics.</p>
        <p>His comments to black delegates were prompted, for the most part, by Ms. Waters' decision to voice her concerns about his record in public forums on both Sunday and Monday. Shortly after she showed up for this morning's caucus meeting at the Westin Bonaventure Hotel, she was cornered by Ms. Herman, one of the Gore campaign's leading emissaries to black Democrats.</p>
        <p>Standing nearly nose-to-nose with Ms. Waters, who had her back to a ballroom door, Ms. Herman began laying out the case for Mr. Lieberman until aides realized the scene was being watched by reporters. They then ushered the two women into the closed ballroom. When Mr. Lieberman arrived to address the caucus, he was brought into a backstage holding room to personally address Ms. Waters's concerns.</p>
        <p>As he did, Mr. Slater was speaking to the caucus members and crediting Mr. Lieberman for voting against a 1998 Republican amendment aimed at ending a federal program that reserves a portion of highway spending for minority-owned firms. Then Eleanor Holmes Norton, the delegate from the District of Columbia, vouched for his civil rights credentials.</p>
        <p>She acknowledged that they had occasional policy differences, but said they were ''overwhelmed by the many things we have in common.'' And she said that President Clinton, who also embraced a centrist agenda, had taught her how to live with disagreements within the party.</p>
        <p>''Look, if you're with me most of the time, you my man,'' she said. ''Don't go too far now. But if you're with me most of the time, you the man.''</p>
        <p>Then Mr. Lieberman took the stage to a prolonged standing ovation from the black delegates. After leading the crowd in singing a round of ''Happy Birthday'' to Ms. Waters, he told of his religious belief that ''every human being is created in God's image'' and recounted his participation in the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1963 March on Washington and in Mississippi voter registration drives. He dropped the names of civil rights leaders and said that equal opportunity was ''the most fundamental principle of American life.''</p>
        <p>That being said, he joked that the recent scrutiny given to his every past word and vote was ''like having a medical procedure without an anesthetic.''</p>
        <p>That record includes comments he reportedly made in 1995 that affirmative action programs that reward people strictly because of race or gender were ''patently unfair.'' He also was quoted then as saying, ''You can't defend policies that are based on group preferences as opposed to individual opportunity.''</p>
        <p>And when asked his views on California's Proposition 209, which banned state-financed affirmative action programs, Mr. Lieberman reportedly said, ''I can't see how I could be opposed to it.''</p>
        <p>Later that year, when Mr. Clinton proposed his ''mend it, don't end it'' approach to tinkering with affirmative action, Mr. Lieberman supported the initiative in a speech on the Senate floor.</p>
        <p>Almost immediately after Mr. Gore selected Mr. Lieberman last week, campaign aides began explaining those stands to minority group leaders. Just hours after word of the decision leaked on Aug. 7, they arranged a conference call between Mr. Lieberman and leading blacks in Congress. Ms. Waters did not participate in the call.</p>
        <p>Speaking today, Mr. Lieberman said that he had been troubled by racial quotas but had supported affirmative action ''because history and current reality make it necessary.'' He noted that he had declined a request for a letter stating his support for Proposition 209 and had voted against two Senate measures that would have eliminated federal affirmative action programs.</p>
        <p>Regarding vouchers, Mr. Lieberman said, as he has repeatedly in the last week, that he supported pilot programs aimed at providing alternatives for children in failing schools. But he added that he strongly supported public education and Mr. Gore's spending proposals to reduce class sizes.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Lieberman's speech, Ms. Waters said that she would now feel  comfortable supporting and campaigning for the Democratic ticket.</p>
        <p>Some Democratic officials are particularly concerned that Mr. Gore's centrist agenda will dampen enthusiasm in swing states where a large turnout of blacks, who were Mr. Clinton's most loyal supporters during impeachment, and other core Democrats is vital. That agenda includes staunch support for global trade and the death penalty, increased military spending, an incremental approach to expanding health coverage and a focus on using the federal surplus for debt reduction, more than on expanding social programs.</p>
        <p>By and large, the party's progressive leaders said they planned to work hard for Mr. Gore's election. But their concerns about how the ticket is playing among rank-and-file Democrats were expressed in their tendency to focus on the perils of a Bush victory more than on the benefits of a Gore administration.</p>
        <p>But some liberals said a campaign built mainly on raising fears about the Republicans would fail to win over independent voters. ''That just conveys the idea that this is a lesser-of-two-evils election,'' said Tom Hayden, a state senator from California and Gore delegate. ''My recommendation is to reach out to the Nader constituency instead of trying to become more Republican. The Democrats are Republican enough.''</p>
