        <p>The Super Bowl rematch here at Adelphia Coliseum on Monday night turned into a super squashing by the Tennessee Titans, a 30-3 embarrassment for the St. Louis Rams in a game where the Titans looked pumped and the Rams looked uninterested.</p>
        <p>So what. It was only a preseason affair. The Rams won the one that counted, 23-16, a championship claimed last January in Atlanta, where the Titans fell a dizzying and deflating yard short of tying the game as time expired.</p>
        <p>This was Tennessee's chance, as Rams safety Keith Lyle explained, to help the healing process for its fans and for the team. For the Titans, mission accomplished. They handed the Rams the worst preseason whipping of any Super Bowl defending champion in National Football League history.</p>
        <p>The Rams gained one passing first down. They failed to convert on 9 of 10 third-down plays. They gained only 120 total yards, fumbled six times and lost four, dropped seven passes, were sacked five times and were penalized seven times.</p>
        <p>The Super Bowl M.V.P., quarterback Kurt Warner, nursing a sore shoulder, took three snaps (the Rams' total of first-quarter plays) and threw one pass. Tennessee, however, looked in midseason form, with a fancy offensive lineup of Steve McNair at quarterback flanked by receivers Carl Pickens, Kevin Dyson, Yancey Thigpen and tight end Frank Wycheck complemented by the dynamic running back Eddie George and a defense that hit until the last whistle.</p>
        <p>''We were not focused,'' said Rams kick returner Tony Horne. ''We looked like a different team.''</p>
        <p>Rams linebacker Mike Jones said: ''We didn't show what we are about. We treated it as a preseason game but they didn't and my hat is off to them.''</p>
        <p>And this from the Rams' new head coach, Mike Martz: ''Even though it was a preseason game, we lacked discipline and that disturbs me. We'll fix that. I did not have this team prepared and Tennessee took this thing very seriously. That will never happen to us again. All of the things that happened are correctable. It is mentally hard to get your team to expect that this kind of thing can happen in this kind of instance, but I am not trying to pooh-pooh what happened. They embarrassed us.''</p>
        <p>So what?</p>
        <p>It was only a preseason game.</p>
        <p>Yet, though it did not count, it mattered.</p>
        <p>Because this is what the Rams will face throughout the 2000 N.F.L. season. They spent so many years in futility, produced a remarkable championship season last year and now enter as kings. Every team wants to knock their crown crooked. The Rams this year will confront the best from their opponents. Beat the champs and you make a name for yourself. Seek and destroy.</p>
        <p>Good thing Martz loves to attack and compete. He and the Rams are in for a full frontal assault. He is only the fifth head coach in league history to newly control a Super Bowl-winning team and the first since Barry Switzer in Dallas in 1994. This is his first head-coaching job.</p>
        <p>Martz replaced Dick Vermeil, who retired. Last season Martz designed a Rams offense that scored the third-most points (526) in league history. Before that Martz, 49, was a quarterbacks coach for two seasons in Washington and an offensive assistant with the Rams for five seasons before that. He began his coaching career with 18 college seasons at stops that included Mesa Community College, Fresno State and Minnesota. He played tight end at Fresno State in the early 1970's.</p>
        <p>The Rams players say he is all about business. Straight to the point. Meticulous attention to detail. They say he extracts greatness from them by knowing what each player can do, putting each in position to do it, by completely breaking down an opponent, attacking where the opponent is weak and then turning up the heat mercilessly in that area.</p>
        <p>''Mike may appear to be quiet, but he is a wolf hiding in a sheep,'' Lyle said. ''Mike is all about kicking somebody's tail. Dick used to prepare a speech to motivate the team. Mike gets up and he's all about attacking the other team.''</p>
        <p>Jones said: ''The torch has been passed and it's Mike's show. He's coming after you.''</p>
        <p>As an offensive coordinator, Martz said he used to lock himself in a room and work all day long, literally, studying film, looking for opponents' weaknesses. ''Now it is all about time management,'' he said. ''I consider the entire team and all relationships. That's real important to me -- that's leadership. I had a year in Washington where we were 0-7 staring at 0-16. I know about stress. I know we'll have our ups and downs. But I like the character of this football team. It's a team that's going to look after each other.''</p>
        <p>And one that had better look around and recognize that defending a championship is an entirely different challenge.</p>
        <p>''Mike is very organized, a good motivator and a great offensive mind,'' said Jeff Fisher, Tennessee's coach. ''What I had to learn in my first year as a head coach was that there is a big picture. Everything you do, you have to keep that in mind. You can't become preoccupied with a third-and-3 play where you didn't make the first down. You are always addressing the big picture.''</p>
        <p>The Rams in bodies are good enough to repeat. The Rams in mind are an untold story.</p>
        <p>''There have been a lot of coordinators who became head coaches who folded it, the daring and attacking style, and just tried to hang on,'' Warner said. ''Mike won't do that. He's not about holding us down. He's all about showing up to play, and I love that. He knows that being aggressive and not tentative is how we won a championship and it's the only way we can win another.''</p>
        <p>That championship attitude starts in the preseason, because though it does not count, it matters. And that, unquestionably, is an important slice of the Rams' big picture.</p>
