        <p>AFTER years of being conditioned to choose fruit juice over soda, most people may be surprised to hear that the majority of fruit juice drinks are only marginally more nutritious than a soft drink.</p>
        <p>Both provide calories from sugar and not much else. In fact, even plain juices often have more calories than soft drinks. An eight-ounce Coke has about 130; eight ounces of juice can range from as few as 110 to as many as 210.</p>

        <p>AFTER years of being conditioned to choose fruit juice over soda, most people may be surprised to hear that the majority of fruit juice drinks are only marginally more nutritious than a soft drink.</p>
        <p>Both provide calories from sugar and not much else. In fact, even plain juices often have more calories than soft drinks. An eight-ounce Coke has about 130; eight ounces of juice can range from as few as 110 to as many as 210.</p>
        <p>At least when you choose a soft drink, you are under no illusions. You get calories (and caffeine) and that's all. But the juice aisle in any store promises more. After all, juice is made from fruit, which is inherently healthful. Some careful study of the label is needed, though, to discover juices that are worth the calories because they have some nutrients.</p>
        <p>Even when you have chosen wisely, fruit juices should not be guzzled like bottled water. If you drink too much juice, there isn't much room left in the calorie column for other foods to fill you up and also provide the nutrients you need. And even though 16-ounce containers are supposed to contain two servings, an awful lot of people drink the entire contents. So what seems innocuous enough at 120 calories a serving becomes the equivalent of a serving of a rich ice cream.</p>
        <p>Juice was once for breakfast only, but now it has become an anytime snack in myriad variations. Size creep is also rampant, and 15 ounces is considered a single serving of some products.</p>
        <p>Fruit at least contains some fiber, but it is usually lost when the fruit is turned into juice. Fiber helps fill you up: juice does not, except momentarily. And juices always contain more calories per ounce than fruit.</p>
        <p>The first clue to how nutritious a juice may be is always the name. If the words ''beverage,'' ''-ade,'' ''cocktail'' or ''drink'' are in the name of the product, it is not 100 percent juice. But makers now sidestep that reality by not calling their products anything. For example, Mountain Sun has a drink called Cranberry Zip. One look at the nutrition label and it's clear this drink makes no contribution to the diet beyond the calories. No matter that the label touts the absence of added sugar: ''The No-No's: No sugar, no corn syrup.'' Sugar is sugar whether it occurs naturally in the juice or is added.</p>
        <p>Since 1994, the government has required makers to list on the label the percentage of juice in the product, but that's only part of the story. The devil is in the details. It's not enough to know how much of the product is juice; it's just as important to know what kind of juice is it. All juices are not created equal. If the first ingredient is apple, grape or pear juice, there is no nutritional bang for the buck.</p>
        <p>For example, the label on Apple &amp; Eve apple-grape juice says: ''100% juice. No sugar added.'' Perfect? Not quite. The apple and grape juices have so little to recommend them nutritionally that the company added enough ascorbic acid to provide 100 percent of the daily requirements for vitamin C. Otherwise what you have is 130 calories in an 8.45-ounce container and 28 grams (or one ounce) of sugar from the juices themselves. No other vitamins, no minerals.</p>
        <p>A few years ago some companies began producing juices with more nutrients and fiber, and Nantucket Nectars has added some of these to its line. The company's Super Nectars Protein Smooth contains 80 percent juice. The first two ingredients are still water and grape juice, but soy protein isolate has been added along with some fruit purees and juice concentrates.</p>
        <p>One 15-ounce bottle is a single serving and provides 200 percent of the daily needs for vitamin C, 6 percent for calcium, 12 percent for iron, 4 grams of fiber, 13 grams of protein and a break-the-bank 410 calories. I guess you could call it a meal in a bottle. But just a couple of these a day as snacks, and on a typical woman's 1,500-to-1,800-calorie diet there won't be much room left for food.</p>
        <p>The latest juices have been fortified with dietary supplements. A handsomely shaped glass bottle of Fire, a product of Snapple, contains ginseng, guarana and ginkgo biloba, suspended in 10 percent ''juice'' that is water, corn syrup, pear juice, citric acid and dragon fruit (whatever that may be). Eight ounces has 120 calories. There's a zero beside all the other items on the nutrition label. Assuming for the moment guarana and the rest are useful, and that's an assumption that hasn't been proved scientifically, there is still no indication of how much of these supplements is provided.</p>
        <p>And don't forget the brand-new honey-flavored grapefruit juice by Tropicana. Adding honey, which is just another form of sugar, brings the calorie count of an eight-ounce serving up from 100 calories to 120 in the blink of an eye.</p>
        <p>It's a jungle out there. Maybe the best thing to do is to cut orange juice with seltzer.</p>
        <p>EATING WELL  Correction:  August 23, 2000, Wednesday  The Eating Well column last Wednesday about the healthfulness of fruit juices misidentified the producer of a grapefruit juice sweetened with honey. It is Florida's Natural, not Tropicana.</p>
