        <p>Chris Armas, one of the top midfielders in the country, has been a standout for the United States national team and the Chicago Fire of Major League Soccer, and today he was added to the Olympic team.</p>
        <p>The 27-year-old Armas, who was born in the Bronx and attended Adelphi University, was one of the three overaged players allowed to be named by the United States Soccer Federation to complete the 18-man squad. Defenders Jeff Agoos of D.C. United and Frankie Hejduk of Bayer Leverkusen in Germany were the other selections over the age of 23.</p>
        <p>Armas has played the most minutes (975) on the national team this season and is confident of its chances Wednesday night against Barbados in a World Cup qualifying match at Foxboro Stadium.</p>
        <p>''We will beat Barbados,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Hejduk's selection was a surprise. He is not on the roster for the Barbados game and did not start in the loss in Costa Rica or in the tie in Guatemala last month. In fact, Hejduk has started only three games for the national team this year.</p>
        <p>John Ellinger, an assistant coach on the Olympic team, said that the coaching staff, led by the head coach Clive Charles, liked Hejduk's ability to attack from his defensive position at right fullback.</p>
        <p>''We got what we thought we needed the most,'' Ellinger said. ''Armas was an outright choice from the beginning. We got Jeff and Frankie because they have speed and like to attack from the outside. Other names popped up, but we went with them because that was the area we needed the most help.''</p>
        <p>M.L.S. rookie standouts like Nick Garcia, Carlos Bocanegra and Rusty Pierce were considered, but Charles's staff went with players who participated in the qualifying games in April.</p>
        <p>Charles and Ellinger selected Adin Brown and Tim Howard as goalkeepers, and added Agoos and Hejduk to a defense of Danny Califf, Ramiro Corrales, Brian Dunseth, Chad McCarty and Evan Whitfield. Armas, Joey DiGiamarino, John O'Brien, Ben Olsen and Peter Vagenas were the selected midfielders, with Chris Albright, Conor Casey, Landon Donovan and Josh Wolff chosen as the forwards.</p>
        <p>''Most of these guys were in the original camp, and we feel strongly about this particular group,'' Ellinger said. ''We also selected this group because it gives us the option of playing 4-4-2 or 4-3-3,'' he said, referring to the formation of playing with four midfielders and two forwards or three midfielders and three forwards.</p>
        <p>There is little secret about the formation Coach Bruce Arena will use for the national team against Barbados on Wednesday in what many consider a must-win game for the Americans. Arena will start just two forwards, Joe-Max Moore and Brian  McBride.</p>
        <p>The most likely starters in the other positions are Brad Friedel in goal, with Tony Sanneh, David Regis, Carlos Llamosa and Agoos on defense, with Armas, Claudio Reyna, Earnie Stewart and Eddie Lewis in midfield.</p>
        <p>Arena scouted Barbados four times and said today that he was impressed by its athleticism and its ability to counterattack.</p>
        <p>''They stay back and counterattack well,'' Arena said. ''They're also good on restarts.''</p>
        <p>CORNER KICKS</p>
        <p>The Americans have not lost in their last 13 World Cup qualifying games at home. Their next two games, against Guatemala and Costa Rica, will also be played at home. . . . TAB RAMOS of the MetroStars may see action as a substitute against Barbados and will not play for the MetroStars on Wednesday night at Tampa Bay. . . . Major League Soccer's trading deadline came and went Tuesday afternoon without a trade taking place.</p>
