        <p>DINING out has its pleasure and its mysteries, and XO sauce is both.</p>
        <p>Those two cryptic letters flitted around for years in the storage area of my brain taken up by old B-movie actors whose names elude me, books I intend to read but have never gotten around to and unsolved historical puzzles like the origin of bouillabaisse, which a faithful correspondent demands that I credit to the Greeks. (He's Greek.)</p>
        <p>A few weeks ago, XO moved directly to my frontal lobe. It is one of the star attractions at a Hong Kong-style restaurant in Manhattan, Ping's Seafood, and on repeated visits I developed an infatuation with it. It came with a simple dish of steamed scallops, showing up as a small, viscous puddle on each shell. The flavor was intriguing: salty and sweet, hot and sour.</p>
        <p>I put my nose right down to table level and studied the situation. I could see tiny bits of dried shrimp, garlic, chilies and scallop. There were very thin chopped-up noodles, too, and nearly microscopic chips and flecks of unknown ingredients. If this was XO, I had to get to the bottom of it.</p>
        <p>A chance remark by a fellow diner heightened my curiosity. He mentioned in passing that when he grew up in Hong Kong, in the 1960's, XO sauce did not exist. All cuisines change, of course, but Chinese cuisine seems almost immutable, an endless list of classic dishes codified eons ago. The very idea of a new sauce on the block made the search for XO that much more compelling. Unfortunately, no one seemed to know very much about it. Even knowledgeable Sinophiles drew a blank when XO came up in the conversation. Books on Chinese cuisine failed to mention it. I began calling and e-mailing experts around the world. I queried the very diligent Hong Kong Tourist Association. I did not turn up a lot. XO, I was told, was born in Hong Kong fairly recently and usually involved dried scallops. That was about it.</p>
        <p>Finally, I reached Ken Hom, the cookbook author, at his home in southwestern France. XO was music to his ears. It turned out that he, too, had embarked on the same quest, about 20 years ago when he was giving cooking classes in Hong Kong and kept encountering a strange new sauce with an odd name. XO.</p>
        <p>Accompanied by Willie Mark, an expert on Hong Kong cuisine, Mr. Hom began eating his way around Hong Kong and quizzing chefs and owners. What was this XO, exactly? Where did it come from? Who invented it? The two detectives never found the smoking wok -- the world of food seldom yields clear-cut answers -- but they narrowed their circle of inquiry tightly enough to make an informed guess.</p>
        <p>''There is a group of very expensive restaurants called Sun Tung Lok, owned by the Yuen family, that specializes in shark's fin dishes,'' Mr. Hom said. ''I think they were the first.'' Then Fook Lam Moon, a celebrated seafood restaurant in Kowloon, began making it, too. ''They actually started bottling and selling their sauce,'' Mr. Hom said, ''which is very rare.''</p>
        <p>An alternative theory comes from Tian-Sak Wong, who edited the Hong Kong magazine Food World at the time. Mr. Wong credits two innovative seafood restaurants for the sauce, East Ocean and Tsui Hang Village.</p>
        <p>The motivation for developing the sauce seems beyond dispute. ''I think it's one of those things where restaurants thought, 'How can we squeeze more money out of the customers?' '' Mr. Hom said. There was a lot of money to be squeezed in Hong Kong at the time. Why not take a basic chili sauce, add some expensive ingredients like dried scallops, give it a marketable name and charge a premium for it? At the time, wealthy diners were ordering the expensive, aged XO-grade Cognac at dinner and drinking it by the bottle through the meal. ''XO'' had just the right splurgy connotations of luxury, like Rolex or Rolls-Royce.</p>
        <p>In Hong Kong, trends spread quickly. Although connoisseurs derided XO as inauthentic, and impractical to boot, it caught on as a status marker. Soon, restaurants all over town were making XO, often throwing in a little twist to establish their own brand, so to speak. The Regent Hotel, for example, added lemon grass to the basic recipe of dried scallops, dried shrimp, Yunan ham, shrimp roe, garlic and chili peppers. Even critics had to concede that the sauce was getting better. Diners began throwing XO on everything. A well-known sauce company, Lee Kum Kee, bottled its own version for the retail market.</p>
        <p>In Vancouver, which probably has more Hong Kong-style restaurants per capita than any city in North America, XO is more or less standard at Chinese restaurants. Most of them charge a supplement of $2 to $5 for the sauce, and at some of the better restaurants it is bottled and sold for use during major holidays, like Chinese New Year. ''Quite a lot of restaurants serve it,'' said Alan Yung, the manager of Sun Sui Wah Seafood, one of Vancouver's highest-rated Chinese restaurants, ''although the quality depends on the what grade of dried scallop you use.'' His version uses dried garlic, dried chilies and uncured Virginia ham.</p>
        <p>At Hon's Wun Tun House, a noodle restaurant, XO is sold on the side, like a condiment. It also appears in beef tenderloin with wide Shanghai noodles.</p>
        <p>''It's terrific with any simple stir-fried seafood, like scallops or prawns with snow peas,'' said Stephen Wong, a Vancouver food writer, who grew up in Hong Kong. ''It's also great with har-gow, the shrimp dumplings that come with dim sum.''</p>
        <p>I have never been to Vancouver, so I can only guess at the XO there. I did manage to find, at a shop across from the Manhattan Bridge market, a four-ounce bottle of Lee Kum Kee's XO, which is regarded as the best of the commercial versions. ''Very good,'' the man behind the counter told me as he took my $6.75. ''Very good, very hot.''</p>
        <p>It was neither. The sauce tasted excessively fishy, and the heat was nowhere to be found. It made me appreciate once again the Ping's version, a baroque creation whose seemingly endless list of ingredients includes fresh scallops, dried scallops, dried shrimp, shrimp roe, salted fish, dried ham, fresh green chilies, garlic, shallots, bacon, noodles and minced chicken. It takes the XO formula, already a newfangled, gaudy creation thrust upon the world by an overheated, fast-money economy, and works so many changes on it that surely a new name is required for this gilded lily. May I suggest Trump sauce?</p>
