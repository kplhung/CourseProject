        <p>Ricky Nolen McGinn, the only inmate ever granted a stay of execution by Gov. George W. Bush, is headed back to the death chamber.</p>
        <p>Convicted of raping and murdering his 12-year-old stepdaughter, Mr. McGinn, 43, came within minutes of being executed on June 1 when Mr. Bush granted him a 30-day reprieve to allow for new DNA tests. But the results of the tests, made public today at a court hearing, further incriminated Mr. McGinn and prompted the presiding judge to reschedule the execution for Sept. 27.</p>
        <p>''All the results were consistent,'' said Lee Haney, the Brown County district attorney.</p>
        <p>Defense lawyers had hoped that testing semen found inside the victim would at the least clear Mr. McGinn of the rape conviction. It was the combination of the rape and murder convictions that qualified him for the death penalty. But each of the DNA tests conducted by the Texas Department of Public Safety, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and two defense experts served to implicate Mr. McGinn further.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, who has presided over 139 executions since taking office in 1995, the most of any governor in the nation, had never granted a reprieve until the McGinn case.</p>
        <p>In a statement today, he said he had granted the stay ''because it was important, in this case, that biological evidence be tested to help determine the defendant's guilt or innocence of the rape charge.</p>
        <p>''The district court action today also demonstrates the safeguards present in our system,'' the governor concluded.</p>
        <p>Maurie Levin, one of Mr. McGinn's lawyers, credited Mr. Bush for allowing the DNA tests but disputed his belief that the results should be interpreted as an endorsement of the Texas death penalty system.</p>
        <p>''Numerous exonerations, in capital and noncapital cases, have been achieved through the use of DNA,'' Ms. Levin said.</p>
        <p>In fact, a Texas inmate, Roy Criner, was released today after DNA tests proved he had been wrongly convicted of rape. Mr. Criner spent 10 years in prison.</p>
