        <p>David Cone was sitting in the steamy third-base dugout in the first inning tonight, contemplating the importance of his start against the Texas Rangers. Cone realized that he had to follow his first victory in 104 days with another positive effort or all of the doubts and the questions about him would creep back.</p>
        <p>Then Cone saw the Yankees pummeling Doug Davis, and he instantly saw several reasons to feel comfortable.

Any of Cone's anxieties should have dissipated.</p>

        <p>David Cone was sitting in the steamy third-base dugout in the first inning tonight, contemplating the importance of his start against the Texas Rangers. Cone realized that he had to follow his first victory in 104 days with another positive effort or all of the doubts and the questions about him would creep back.</p>
        <p>Then Cone saw the Yankees pummeling Doug Davis, and he instantly saw several reasons to feel comfortable. There was a leadoff single by Derek Jeter, a run-scoring single by Paul O'Neill, a bloop single by Jose Canseco that knocked in a run and a monstrous two-run homer by David Justice. Any of Cone's anxieties should have dissipated.</p>
        <p>Before Cone had dug in in front of the pitcher's mound, the Yankees had bruised Davis for four runs. By the third, they had added three more and Cone's comfort level had grown. Cone wound up pitching five innings, the Yankees wound up winning, 10-2, and Cone was elated to win his second straight start for the first time since he defeated the Baltimore Orioles on June 26 and July 2, 1999. Maybe Cone can salvage something from what had been a dreadful season up until two weeks ago.</p>
        <p>''I feel like I can hide again,'' Cone said. ''I can blend in and contribute, as opposed to stand out. That's a nice feeling.''</p>
        <p>Cone would be thrilled to just become a footnote in a rout like this. The Yankees won with a relentless attack, and they stymied the Rangers for the 10th straight time, including the 1999 division series. If Cone had not experienced a 15-start streak without a victory from April to August, he would have been a minor part of recapping this game after tossing five sound innings in the 93-degree weather.</p>
        <p>But Cone's performances will be scrutinized after what he endured. He has now allowed seven earned runs in his last 17 innings (3.71 earned run average) to improve to 3-10 and, with Orlando Hernandez trying to recover from injuries and Denny Neagle struggling, he might manage to slip back into the equation for the postseason rotation. That possibility would have seemed inconceivable four starts ago.</p>
        <p>''At least now he's working on his game,'' Torre said, ''as opposed to trying to win a game.''</p>
        <p>Cone has slowed his delivery, has reduced the movement of his hands and has shifted his eyes away from the plate since returning from working with Billy Connors, an organization pitching coach, in Tampa, Fla. Cone said he looks at the ground before picking up the catcher's target because he feels it helps his rhythm to pick up the mitt just before he delivers the ball.</p>
        <p>After the Yankees jumped to a 4-0 lead in the first, Cone pitched the way that a pitcher should work with a large lead by throwing strikes and not trying to be too perfect. Cone gave up two runs and four hits in the fifth, but he got Gabe Kapler to fly out to end the inning. Since Cone had thrown 92 pitches, Torre told him ''you don't need to pitch anymore,'' and he summoned Dwight Gooden for the sixth. Cone gave up seven hits, struck out three, walked one and felt relieved.</p>
        <p>''It feels good,'' Cone said. ''The last win took a lot of pressure off me. I go out there, we get four runs in the first, and it looks like it was going to be a good night for me. It was.''</p>
        <p>Davis barely had the chance to breath in the first. Jeter singled to left, Sojo blooped a single to right-center and O'Neill ended an 0-for-15 drought by belting a single to left for a 1-0 lead.</p>
        <p>After a double play, Canseco dropped a single into shallow right and Justice hammered a 1-0 slider about 10 rows into the right-field upper deck. The ball traveled 443 feet, and was the longest homer ever hit to right at the Ballpark in Arlington.</p>
        <p>''I thought it was going to go over the roof,'' Torre said.</p>
        <p>Scott Brosius, who turned 34 today, stroked a two-run homer in the third, Jorge Posada doubled in a run in the fourth, O'Neill blasted a two-run homer in the fifth and the Yankees were cruising with a 10-run cushion. So was Cone. His season had been on life support, but Cone has won twice in six days to revive himself and make the next six weeks intriguing instead of painful.</p>
        <p>''I haven't given up,'' Cone said. ''I still feel like I can reel off a few in a row, and take off on a good run. I don't have much of a margin for error. I have to put together a streak and keep it going.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>JORGE POSADA has 22 homers, 21 as a catcher, so he could challenge YOGI BERRA's club record of 30 homers by a catcher. Berra did it in 1952 and 1956. With 21 homers in 115 games, Posada is on pace to hit 29 for a full season. But Posada did not want reporters to tell him how many Berra hit. ''I'll look it up when the season is over and I'll see what happens, but, right now, I'm going to concentrate on what I have to do today,'' Posada said. ''I'm not worrying about records. Every time I'm out there is a record for me.'' . . . RAMIRO MENDOZA, who has tendinitis in his right shoulder, received a cortisone shot and JOE TORRE said Mendoza would test himself by throwing this weekend. . . . GABE KAPLER singled off DWIGHT GOODEN in the eighth to boost his hitting streak to 28 games. Gooden pitched four shutout innings and notched his second career save. The last one came on Sept. 19, 1989, when Gooden was with the Mets. ''Coming in behind him was weird,'' Gooden said, referring to DAVID CONE. ''I'll have to get him to sign the ball.''</p>
