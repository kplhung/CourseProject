        <p>A caller to Howard Stern's radio show was arrested yesterday at his home on Long Island and charged with saying on the air that he wanted to kill Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the Democratic candidate for vice president.</p>
        <p>The caller, Lawrence C. Franco, 23, phoned the talk show around 6:25 a.m. on Monday and, according to a complaint issued by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn, made several anti-religious remarks before saying: ''So that Lieberman guy has gotta go. He is gonna take my bullet. He's going to take it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman is the first Jewish candidate to run on the presidential ticket for either of the two major political parties. Even so, Mr. Franco, who identified himself on the show as ''Nazarene,'' repeatedly made remarks like: ''I hate churchgoers. I hate them all,'' according to the complaint.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Stern asked Mr. Franco whether he was actually threatening Senator Lieberman, Mr. Franco said, ''I'm telling you right now, you got the killer on the air.''</p>
        <p>The United States Secret Service, which has been protecting Mr. Lieberman since he was chosen last week to be Vice President Al Gore's running mate, checked the records of calls to the station and traced the number to a house in Farmingdale, N.Y., where Mr. Franco lives with his father, who is also named Lawrence. Although Mr. Franco boasted on the air that he would have ''guns out the window'' if federal agents came to get him, members of the Secret Service who searched his bedroom found only a pellet gun.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franco earns his living assembling newspapers for Newsday, said his lawyer, Abraham Klott. Appearing before Magistrate Joan M. Azrack of Federal District Court in Brooklyn, Mr. Klott said there was no evidence that his client was truly a danger to Senator Lieberman or anyone else.</p>
        <p>''This was 'The Howard Stern Show,' '' Mr. Klott added. ''This is an example of what happens with talk radio going out of control.''</p>
        <p>Magistrate Azrack released Mr. Franco on $200,000 bail and placed him under house arrest. Outside the courtroom, a man who introduced himself as the defendant's uncle said: ''It was the wrong thing to do. It was a joke gone wrong.''</p>
        <p>Dan Gerstein, a spokesman for Senator Lieberman, who is spending the week in Los Angeles at the Democratic National Convention, declined to comment on the incident.</p>
