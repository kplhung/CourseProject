        <p>British Airways grounded its entire fleet of Concorde supersonic airliners today after French and British investigators said they would urge the withdrawal of the airplane's airworthiness certification following last month's fatal Air France Concorde crash near Paris.</p>
        <p>It would be the first time in more than 20 years that an airworthiness certificate for a commercial airliner was revoked by any country, British aviation experts said. The investigators said they would not spell out their reasoning until Wednesday, although France said their concern was about risks linked to the aircraft's tires.</p>
        <p>And so it was unclear why exactly they were recommending certification be withdrawn, what steps would have to be taken to reverse the recommendation or how long the Concorde would be out of service.</p>
        <p>A British Airways spokeswoman said the suspension of flights was ''indefinite.'' But it remained unclear whether the move effectively meant the end of Concorde flights -- the elite preserve of executives, bankers and celebrities over the airplane's 25 years of commercial flying.</p>
        <p>British Airways and Air France are the only airlines to fly the Concorde. Aviation experts and officials say the investigators' action suggests they believe that British Airways' fleet of seven Concordes faces the same risk of catastrophe as the doomed Air France Flight 4590.</p>
        <p>''Based on everything I know, it is a safe aircraft to fly,'' said the British Airways chief executive, Rod Eddington. ''But at the end of the day, we rest on the information provided to us by the accident investigators and regulators.''</p>
        <p>The July 25 crash, which killed 113 people, was the first fatal accident in the airplane's history. Air France immediately suspended flights by its remaining five Concordes. British Airways, after a one-day suspension,  continued to fly the needle-nosed airliner, which crosses the Atlantic in three and a half hours.</p>
        <p>French investigators concluded five days ago that a 16-inch piece of metal on the runway at Charles de Gaulle Airport probably slashed a tire as the Air France plane hurtled toward takeoff, creating debris that ruptured fuel tanks. The plane took off with a plume of flame spewing from its wing and crashed less than two minutes later.</p>
        <p>British officials declined to say whether today's suspension meant that British Airways' Concordes had also been at risk since the Paris crash. But Chris Mason, a spokesman for Britain's Civil Aviation Authority, said that after French investigators focused on the role of the tire blowout in the accident, ''we have taken the position that we think it right to suspend the certificate of airworthiness for Concorde'' in Britain as well as France.</p>
        <p>Helena Bastianelli, a spokeswoman for the French accident investigation bureau, said a ruptured tire ''should not have such consequences as the piercing of the tank and the destruction of the aircraft.''</p>
        <p>''We are seeing there is something that is not safe there and until the safety of the aircraft can be guaranteed, we recommend that the Concorde stops flying,'' she continued.</p>
        <p>Britain's Press Association news agency reported tonight that British Airways Concordes had been fitted with reinforced flaps above the undercarriage because of the risk of debris from damaged tires hitting the wings. An alarm system had also been positioned on the flight decks to warn crew members of blowouts. It was not clear whether Air France had made similar modifications, the agency said.</p>
        <p>David Learmount, operations and safety editor of Flight International magazine, called the recommendation for suspension of the Concorde's certification ''very, very rare and very, very serious.''</p>
        <p>He said British Airways had modified its Concordes in the mid-1990's to prevent similar tire accidents from causing catastrophic damage and, on the basis of that modification,  the airplanes continued flying.</p>
        <p>After assessing evidence from the French investigation, however, he said British investigators ''must have come to the conclusion that despite the British Airways modification, the risk is unacceptably high.''</p>
        <p>A suspension of certification, he said, means ''the aircraft is grounded and it has to be modified so that the risk is eliminated or reduced'' to the satisfaction of regulators. The last such suspension, he said, involved McDonnell Douglas DC-10 aircraft. The United States Federal Aviation Administration grounded them for five weeks in 1979 after the crash of an American Airlines plane in Chicago killed 275 people.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mason at the Civil Aviation Authority said it was ''almost impossible'' to say how long the suspension would remain in force, but aviation industry experts said that, whatever the outcome, the combination of last month's accident and the recommended withdrawal of flying certification could dent confidence in the Concorde beyond repair.</p>
        <p>Concorde flights account for only a fraction of the earnings of both Air France and British Airways, although British Airways is thought to earn slightly more because it usually schedules two flights a day each way between London and New York, whereas Air France had one. The service is reduced to one return journey each day in August, when demand is low, British Airways said.</p>
        <p>Despite high maintenance and fuel costs, the aircraft acts as a prestige emblem, drawing in the well-heeled corporate passengers British Airways, in particular, sees as its principal source of income. Aviation industry experts have suggested that, if the Concorde loses its appeal, corporate travelers could move to other airlines or corporate jets.</p>
        <p>British Airways said it was told early today by Britain's Air Accidents Investigation Branch that both it and its French counterpart, the Bureau of Accident Investigations, would recommend on Wednesday that the Concorde's certificate of airworthiness be suspended. When the word came, said Mr. Eddington, the British Airways chief executive, a British Airways Concorde flight, BA 001, was about to depart for New York on schedule, at 10:30 a.m.</p>
        <p>The 100-seat airliner had begun to taxi after pushing off from the stand at Heathrow Airport in London with 37 people on board, a British Airways spokeswoman said. The plane was ordered back to the terminal and the flight canceled, along with the return flight scheduled for tonight from New York. The passengers were transferred to subsonic flights.</p>
        <p>In a television interview, Mr. Eddington said he did not know what was behind the decision by the regulators.</p>
        <p>Mr. Eddington said that after the Air France accident, British Airways had carried out ''an extensive series of checks on the aircraft's air frame, engines, tires and wheels, hydraulics and other systems.'' And, he said, Britain's Civil Aviation Authority -- the industry regulator -- had been ''in complete agreement with our decision to resume Concorde's services shortly after the Air France crash.''</p>
        <p>Today's silence about the cause of the suspension infuriated some people living near the Concorde's flight path. ''The Civil Aviation Authority must tell us, particularly those living near the airport, what has happened to bring about this reversal of policy,'' said David Wilshire, an opposition lawmaker representing the area around Heathrow.</p>
        <p>While investigators' attention has centered on the tire blowout, the Concorde's safety record has come under scrutiny in the past few weeks. New Scientist magazine said it had details of a study of Concorde's engines, commissioned by British Airways two years ago, identifying 55 ''significant risks.'' British Airways said, however, that the Civil Aviation Authority had seen no need for improvement in the airplane's safety precautions because of the study.</p>
