        <p>IT was not exactly what I expected to see on entering Polanka, a Polish-American restaurant in Lower Manhattan. A D.J. with a rig the size of a Volkswagen was just inside the entrance, spinning soul tunes from the 60's and 70's. At the bar, women were grooving in their seats, singing the words to ''Lean on Me'' as if they were several drinks into their high school reunion. And as we sat down, a waitress greeted us as if the bouncing and singing were part of the furniture.</p>
        <p>Polanka is a happy blend of disparate parts, bound together by some of the lightest, most delectable Polish cooking I've had in New York. Starting with the owners, Hussein Hussein and Irina Zatulovskiy, it's an unexpected mixture that works.</p>

        <p>IT was not exactly what I expected to see on entering Polanka, a Polish-American restaurant in Lower Manhattan. A D.J. with a rig the size of a Volkswagen was just inside the entrance, spinning soul tunes from the 60's and 70's. At the bar, women were grooving in their seats, singing the words to ''Lean on Me'' as if they were several drinks into their high school reunion. And as we sat down, a waitress greeted us as if the bouncing and singing were part of the furniture.</p>
        <p>Polanka is a happy blend of disparate parts, bound together by some of the lightest, most delectable Polish cooking I've had in New York. Starting with the owners, Hussein Hussein and Irina Zatulovskiy, it's an unexpected mixture that works.</p>
        <p>The two have been working together for more than a decade, at Cafe Irina in the East Village and at TriBeCa in TriBeCa. Having sold the other restaurants, they opened Polanka nine months ago in a former Irish bar with a great name, the Beaten Path.</p>
        <p>The path into Polanka still looks well worn, a narrow strip of mosaic-tile flooring of a couple of clashing designs that passes several tables and a bar before opening into a wider tiled dining room. A strip of flashing floor lights borders the path to the bar, while the high ceiling and sloping walls are painted bright red and yellow. The effect -- and it looks like a work in progress -- is that of a woman with bright red hair and harlequin glasses; jaunty but peculiar.</p>
        <p>At lunch, the room is a bit more sedate. The floor lights still flash, but the D.J. gives way to a stereo playing great old Ray Charles hits as local business people dine on pirogies and kielbasa. But nighttime pulses, with different nights given over to salsa, blues and jazz. On Saturday nights, another D.J., identified as Bela, plays disco and trance.</p>
        <p>The food strives to please all types, too, with Caesar salad, roast turkey, meatloaf and other bland American dishes, but I'd stick to the Eastern European specialties. Ms. Zatulov skiy has a delightfully light touch that makes this hearty cuisine more than bearable in hot weather. With no sour cream added, cold borscht ($3) is a perfect starter, pleasantly sweet and sour, with plenty of onions, dill and black pepper. The Odessa salad ($6.85) is a harmonious blend of flavors and textures, with tender but tart greens, shredded beets, slivers of sweet prunes and walnuts.</p>
        <p>Polanka makes its own pirogies, the Polish stuffed dumplings that are often doughy but here are exceedingly light. They are served boiled or fried with a variety of fillings; my favorites are the ones with fluffy potatoes ($6.85), fried for extra flavor and texture, and the meat pirogies ($7.45), boiled because the ground pork is savory enough.</p>
        <p>Bigos ($6.95), Polish sauerkraut stew, is one of those dishes that I associate with the dead of winter, but I was astounded by the soft, feathery sauerkraut, scented with parsley and juniper and studded with chunks of pork, beef and smoky kielbasa, served with light, diamond-shaped potato dumplings. Other good choices include chewy boiled beef in a zingy horseradish sauce ($10.25) and a huge portion of stuffed cabbage with beets and cucumber salad ($8.75). Crisp and delicious potato pancakes with parsley and apple sauce ($7.95) consist of four cakes, each the size of a catcher's mitt.</p>
        <p>Service is extremely attentive, which makes up for occasional communication breakdowns. I have not been able to elicit much in the way of a dessert list, other than ''creamy cakes,'' though I learned later that Ms. Zatulovskiy makes her own apple cake.</p>
        <p>In the style of many small restaurants, Polanka uses its walls to show original art. The current show includes contemporary Russian works, including ''Meat Dumplings,'' ''Still Life With Garlic'' and my favorite, ''Don't Even Touch My Carrots.''</p>
