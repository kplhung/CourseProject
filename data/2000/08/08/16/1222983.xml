        <p>Editorial urges Federal Communications Commission to reject proposal by Rupert Murdoch to acquire WWOR-TV in New York City, where he already owns another television station and the New York Post; says this acquisition, in addition to proposed purchase of nine other TV stations nationwide, would create troubling concentration of media outlets that would not be in public interest (S)</p>

        <p>Rupert Murdoch proposed this week to add to his already vast media holdings by buying WWOR Channel 9 in the New York City region and nine other television stations across the country from Chris-Craft Industries. The purchase would give his company, News Corporation, ownership of stations that reach more than 35 percent of the viewing public in the nation, violating a rule of the Federal Communications Commission. Mr. Murdoch plans to satisfy the commission by selling as many stations as necessary.</p>
        <p>Even so, the proposed purchase would create a troubling concentration of media outlets. It would give him two television stations each in New York, Los Angeles, Phoenix and Salt Lake City. The commission allows for owning two stations if diversity of expression is preserved.

        <p>Rupert Murdoch proposed this week to add to his already vast media holdings by buying WWOR Channel 9 in the New York City region and nine other television stations across the country from Chris-Craft Industries. The purchase would give his company, News Corporation, ownership of stations that reach more than 35 percent of the viewing public in the nation, violating a rule of the Federal Communications Commission. Mr. Murdoch plans to satisfy the commission by selling as many stations as necessary.</p>
        <p>Even so, the proposed purchase would create a troubling concentration of media outlets. It would give him two television stations each in New York, Los Angeles, Phoenix and Salt Lake City. The commission allows for owning two stations if diversity of expression is preserved. That means it requires that at least eight independent TV stations survive in each market and that no one owns more than one of any market's four top-rated stations.</p>
        <p>These rules would require Mr. Murdoch to sell one station in Salt Lake City. But even in some of the cities where the ownership rules are not violated, the commission might reasonably decide that Mr. Murdoch's proposal, by eliminating competition between two independent sources of news and entertainment, would not serve the public interest.</p>
        <p>Whatever pros and cons owning two stations  may pose in other cities, however, the commission should firmly reject it for New York. There Mr. Murdoch owns not only another television station, Channel 5, but also The New York Post, one of three daily newspapers competing with The Times in New York City. Commission rules forbid joint ownership of television stations and newspapers in the same city except in emergencies. No such emergency exists that would warrant the commission's waiving rules designed to preserve the diversity of news and entertainment on which democracy thrives.</p>
        <p>The commission granted Mr. Murdoch a waiver in 1993 so he could buy The New York Post despite the fact that he already owned Channel 5. It reasoned, correctly, that the rule had to be waived to keep the newspaper from going out of business. But this time there is no such threat. Neither The Post nor Channel 9 is in danger of collapse.</p>
