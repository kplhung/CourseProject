        <p>NOTHING quite underscores the driving force of suburban life like sciatica.</p>
        <p>The sciatic nerve runs down the leg like an expressway, and just as a fender-bender in Jericho can ruin traffic along the Long Island Expressway to Ronkonkoma, the nerve in distress can turn life's little annoyances into true misery. A drive to the cleaners feels fatal. Sitting on the back porch causes leg pain that dwarfs the threat of virus-laden mosquitoes. Running after the family dog adds agony to the usual humiliation.</p>
        <p>But combine a bout of leg pain with a job chronicling life in the suburbs and you'll understand why I'll forever remember this as the Summer of Sciatica.</p>
        <p>The singular experience of braving traffic jams in the region's three states (sometimes in one day!) has turned excruciating. A recent drive to Camden, N.J., never an AAA-recommended scenic tour, was a calamity. An assignment in the Catskills was crippling. Crossing the Throgs Neck Bridge is just not the same with a throbbing leg.</p>
        <p>My diagnosis is a spasm in the piriformis muscle, conveniently situated near the rear pants pocket, which irritates the sciatic nerve.</p>
        <p>Standing and walking are fine. Sitting hurts. Driving kills. All the usual suspects are suspected: stress, age, lack of regular exercise, lack of irregular exercise, too much time with the pedal to the metal. Sciatica is common among pregnant women, taxi drivers and, it seems, everyone else you mention it to.</p>
        <p>As illnesses go, it's hardly calamitous. But the delicate balance of suburban existence topples when sitting and driving become royal pains in the rear pocket.</p>
        <p>Take last Thursday's insanity. Friends generously offer four field-level tickets to the noon Yankees game. Our two young resident fans thrilled. Spouse working. Caregiver busy until 1 p.m. My reporting day starting at 2 p.m. at the office of a laser eye surgeon in New Jersey. Solution: I take kids to Yankees game, wait for caregiver to relieve me, then proceed to laser surgeon.</p>
        <p>All's going well until the sciatic pain becomes unbearable near the George Washington Bridge. I exit in Manhattan, bring the car to a screeching stop and walk around in the street, creating a memorable childhood moment for the younger generation. More pain finding a parking space in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>The game's terrific, not that I see much. David Cone finds his groove. I lose mine. The stadium seats, just behind the on-deck circle, are sciatic-unfriendly. I can't sit for more than a half-inning before having to walk around. The men sitting behind us eye me warily. Derek Jeter, in a hostile act directed at me, stands in the on-deck circle effortlessly swaying his piriformis muscle. Girls squeal. I yelp. I suddenly realize that our seats are so good we are visible behind the batter on television. I imagined my bosses spotting me. I feel like one of those city employees out of work on disability caught on grainy videotape water skiing.</p>
        <p>THE caregiver arrives in the third inning. I depart for my appointment with the laser surgeon. I interview him standing up. He makes amazing claims, none involving sciatica.</p>
        <p>Little has helped, except -- believe it or not -- the Republican convention, which  liberated me from my car. The gentle patter of happy-talk was an effective analgesic. Laura Bush's speech was like a gentle whirlpool, and by the time George W. Bush spoke, my Grand Old Piriformis felt 20 years younger. Even an encounter with Newt Gingrich didn't hurt. My muscle tightened only when Dick Cheney attacked the Democrats. My sciatic nerve is not Democratic, but, like the body politic, is irritated by negative campaigning.</p>
        <p>But the G.O.P. cure wore off quickly. The pain returned by the time the Amtrak train reached the abandoned buildings of North Philadelphia. I was sitting once again.</p>
        <p>Maybe another convention would have helped, with a chance to be on my feet for four straight days talking to politicians. But it would have been hard to endure a plane ride to Los Angeles and, ultimately, Bill Clinton would never have felt my pain. Besides, watching Democrats sitting, sitting, sitting at one after another fund-raiser in California is making my leg hurt again.</p>
        <p>So now, back in suburbia, enduring daily life is the true test, as always. Doing it without sitting is a challenge. The question is how much can I stand? The answer is, not nearly enough.</p>
