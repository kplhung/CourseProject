        <p>If Prince Naseem Hamed, the undefeated World Boxing Organization featherweight champion, is anything but confident as he prepares to defend his title against Augie Sanchez, it is not showing.</p>
        <p>''He seems to be a well-schooled, correct fighter,'' Hamed said in a conference call yesterday. ''I love it when fighters are textbook. I'm taught to adapt and exploit every situation in the ring.''</p>
        <p>Hamed (34-0, 30 knockouts) and Sanchez (26-1, 23 knockouts) will meet in a 12-rounder on Saturday night at Foxwoods Resort Casino in Mashantucket, Conn. The 126-pound Hamed has defended his title 15 times.</p>
        <p>Sanchez has won 10 straight bouts, including 9 by knockout.</p>

        <p>TUA IS NEXT FOR LEWIS DEFENSE: An agreement was reached yesterday for Lennox Lewis to defend the World Boxing Council and International Boxing Federation heavyweight titles against David Tua on Nov. 11 in either Toronto or Las Vegas.</p>
        <p>Tua is guaranteed $3.5 million plus a percentage of pay-per-view profits for the fight, an I.B.F. mandatory title defense for Lewis, who said he could make more than $10 million.</p>
