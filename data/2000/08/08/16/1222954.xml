        <p>FIVE years removed from his last lucrative acting job, Thurman E. Scott still refused to bite when the television serial people swung by his place, the Actors Theater Workshop, pitched him a role and promised to tailor their taping schedule to his schedule.</p>
        <p>Why the brushoff? Mr. Scott is far too busy teaching acting technique, has been since Stella Adler handed him her baton in 1990, to indulge in leading-man theatrics anymore.</p>
        <p>''Put up with my schedule? I told them they must be insane; they'd hate me after two days,'' says Mr. Scott, whose priorities are spiritual, not commercial. ''I'd rather have them like me.'' The Scott method is big on like, love and telling the truth (except for his age). He even put the producer Arnon Milchan (''Pretty Woman'') on hold when Mr. Milchan brought him a script nobody in Hollywood could understand and asked him to be its ''gunfighter.'' That's Hollywood talk for developer.</p>
        <p>With the script based on a man with 23 personalities, how did Mr. Scott, a complex cat himself, resist? He told Mr. Milchan his front-burner gunfighter responsibilities lie with his West 28th Street theater, where his acolytes, including two dozen homeless children from Harlem, depend on him to do right by them.</p>
        <p>Mr. Scott, the touchy progenitor of the Workshop (he and his wife call it their baby), hasn't slept for two days -- the price of keeping a nonprofit creative work space afloat in for-profit Manhattan. But it's not lack of sleep, or lack of financing for projects like the empowering summer session with the Harlem kids, triggering his petulance. It's a big buffer zone of a table here in Studio 1. How can he perform a soul-baring interview with that in the way?</p>
        <p>''This setting is too impersonal,'' he booms, his voice stoked by the same stentorian rumble that helped make James Earl Jones (best man at his wedding) a household name.</p>
        <p>Why isn't Mr. Scott a household name, too, after his brilliant beginnings as a leading man: six seasons with Joseph Papp's New York Shakespeare Festival, the soaps, Obie Awards, the thumbs-up from Stanley Kubrick? The lead in the national tour of Lorraine Hansberry's ''To Be Young, Gifted and Black''? But in Mr. Scott's case, conflicted.</p>
        <p>At his behest, theater staffers cut our scene down to size: the table gets the hook. But still he isn't cozy. He has his hand on the tissue box, a signal of things to come.</p>
        <p>''I don't like talking about my life; I get emotional,'' he warns after a segue into sudden sobs over the unjust demise, 50 years ago, of Bob, his loyal brown mule back in Corapeake, N.C. Mr. Scott can't stomach injustice. ''I come out of a lot of complexity,'' he adds, describing himself as loyal to a fault. Like Bob.</p>
        <p>IT doesn't take much to intuit that Mr. Scott brims with baggage: rejected at birth by his white father; raised on a farm by his black grandfather and other surrogates after his mother skipped town to regroup; goaded into becoming an Air Force middleweight boxing champion after black and white teenagers took umbrage at his toffee skin and beat the daylights out of him; drawn to acting by his fascination with death scenes; vaunted as Marlon Brando's doppelganger by their mentor, Ms. Adler; leery of the artistic compromise that accompanies commercial acclaim; stung when his (white) wife's parents shunned their marriage.</p>
        <p>No wonder he did such memorable stage venting. How good is this guy who camped in Ms. Adler's library, subsisted on White Castle burgers and took eight years of acting classes before auditioning for a play?</p>
        <p>''I was the star at Stella's; Bobby was about eighth in the class,'' he says, referring to Robert De Niro, a classmate. ''Bobby had abandonment issues,'' he adds, in a takes-one-to-know-one tone. ''I know the pain of being connected on a journey with someone and then have them say, 'You can't come.' ''</p>
        <p>He remembers why he wasn't wanted when he was born: ''My father left me because his family said my mother was black. That's why I have so much hatred for racism, no tolerance for it. That's why I can help these children from Harlem understand that whatever they come from, they can reach the moon.''</p>
        <p>With that, Mr. Scott decides he's in the mood to pray. Hands are joined. He supplies the monologue: humanistic connections, inner truth, commonality of acceptance. It's part acting class, part self-help sermon. Amen, he's finally relaxed. His mother always told him he'd be a universal minister. Now this theater is his church and, like the farm, his imagination station.</p>
        <p>He's a nonlinear thinker, and nonviolent (except when imitating the lady who jumped onstage and throttled him when she found his Obie-winning Napoleon-Hitler character in ''Open 24 Hours'' too malevolent to bear).</p>
        <p>His performance didn't shock his mother, whom he rejoined in Philadelphia when he was 12. '' 'All that struggle and passion; that's exactly who he is inside,' '' Mr. Scott recalls her telling her husband, who adopted him and ''felt pain'' when he contacted his biological father, a Michigan prosecutor.</p>
        <p>Why is Mr. Scott training other actors, and the Harlem homeless, instead of reviving his own star? It's a vision thing: ''I believe that having a philosophy of living is just as important as the things you do. I was never in it for the money.''</p>
        <p>Though the theater does welcome donations. And mentors for the kids, no creative experience needed.</p>
