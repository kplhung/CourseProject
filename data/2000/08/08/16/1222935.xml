        <p>Michael Cowpland, the founder of the Corel Corporation, abruptly resigned today from all his executive positions at the ailing Canadian software developer, and put its future in the hands of a new chief executive and a revamped board. He said he would remain a director.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cowpland is succeeded as interim chief executive and president by Derek J. Burney, formerly Corel's executive vice president for engineering and chief of technology. James Baillie, a well-known Toronto lawyer, has taken over as chairman of Corel and will head a committee to review the composition of the board and Corel's survival plan.</p>
        <p>The British-born Mr. Cowpland, 57, started Corel 15 years ago after he and a partner, Terence Matthews, sold their interest in a telecommunications equipment maker, the Mitel Corporation. Corel developed computer software products like Coreldraw and acquired others, like Wordperfect, and its stock traded as high as $44.50 on the Nasdaq in 1999. But investor confidence collapsed as the company continued to lose money and failed to meet promised profit forecasts. Today, its shares closed at $3.66, up 6.25 cents.</p>
        <p>With sales of its older graphics design products in decline, Corel tied its future to the Linux operating system, but the collapse of a merger earlier this year with the Inprise Corporation left it short of cash. In June, 350 jobs were cut -- 21 percent of the staff -- as part of a plan to trim costs by $40 million a year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cowpland, who owns about 10 percent of Corel and recently said he expects the company to be profitable by the fourth quarter, said he would pursue start-up opportunities.</p>
        <p>Also, he is likely to be tried later this year on charges of insider trading, brought by the Ontario Securities Commission last fall, for selling $14 million worth of shares in 1997 shortly before unexpectedly poor earnings were reported.</p>
