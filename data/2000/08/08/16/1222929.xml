        <p>Dukakis Cousins Go Separate Ways</p>
        <p>OLYMPIA DUKAKIS, who introduced her cousin, MICHAEL, in a folksy video at the Democratic convention in 1988, when he was nominated to run against George W. Bush's father, had no plans to attend the convention in Los Angeles. But Mr. Dukakis, who answered his own phone yesterday at Northeastern University in Boston, said he would leave for Los Angeles this afternoon. ''I've got students to teach in the morning,'' said Mr. Dukakis, who teaches public policy.</p>

        <p>Dukakis Cousins Go Separate Ways</p>
        <p>OLYMPIA DUKAKIS, who introduced her cousin, MICHAEL, in a folksy video at the Democratic convention in 1988, when he was nominated to run against George W. Bush's father, had no plans to attend the convention in Los Angeles. But Mr. Dukakis, who answered his own phone yesterday at Northeastern University in Boston, said he would leave for Los Angeles this afternoon. ''I've got students to teach in the morning,'' said Mr. Dukakis, who teaches public policy.</p>
        <p>The cousins have not spoken since before the primaries. ''The first conversation we had,'' Ms. Dukakis said recently, ''he came out backing Gore right from the beginning, and I was backing Bill Bradley.'' He ''acknowledged we were doing something different and didn't go into it much,'' she said.</p>
        <p>On to ''Better Living,'' a movie that opened this week with Ms. Dukakis playing a delusional mother. The hardest part, she said, was ''having to jump in and out of a six-foot hole that I was digging.''</p>
        <p>''I had one of those jackhammers,'' Ms. Dukakis said. ''Learning how to deal with those things, they have a life of their own. Pretty soon you're flying through the air.''</p>
        <p>Sundance East, The Subway Series</p>
        <p>The three young men might have been a couple of movie stars and their director, but the film, ''Goat on Fire and Smiling Fish,'' is an indie, and they were taking the subway around New York to talk about it. In their spare time, they were hanging out at the Angelika Film Center on West Houston Street, serenading ticket buyers with improvised songs about burning goats and loopy fish.</p>
        <p>Say, guys, how many people complain about the title?</p>
        <p>''Nine out of 10,'' said KEVIN JORDAN, the director. The title refers to Indian names given to two brothers by their grandmother. The film, one of those romantic comedies in which guys sit around talking about girls, has nothing to do with fish or goats or, for that matter, Indians. The creators tried, they said, but could not come up with a better title.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jordan, 26, and the brothers STEVEN and DERICK MARTINI, 24 and 26, respectively, made the film in 12 days for $40,000. They relied primarily on their own experiences with women when they wrote the script. But they took some license. Steven Martini said he had never had a toaster thrown in his face, as happens in the movie, ''but I got an iron in the back once.''</p>
        <p>Although the film does not open in New York until Aug. 25, some former girlfriends have already caught up with it at film festivals, where it won several awards. Derick Martini said that one had run out of the theater crying.</p>
        <p>''What am I supposed to do?'' he asked. ''I'm supposed to write about what I know.''</p>
        <p>Singing Survivor</p>
        <p>The singer GLORIA GAYNOR survived a two-hour trip  from her home in New Jersey to Fifth Avenue and 59th Street yesterday. ''At least it quit raining,'' said her husband, LINWOOD SIMON.</p>
        <p>It was a good thing the rain stopped. Miss Gaynor was at CBS to videotape a segment for ''The Early Show'' to be shown next Wednesday, 12 or 13 hours before the final episode of the network's prime-time hit ''Survivor.'' Miss Gaynor sang -- what else? -- ''I Will Survive'' to a little crowd that had gathered outside the studio in the Trump General Motors Building.</p>
        <p>Who will be the survivor? ''We don't know if the last man standing is a man or a woman,'' a CBS makeup artist said while powdering Miss Gaynor's nose. ''All we know is it's a human.''</p>
        <p>Soon Miss Gaynor was talking about surviving the summer. She recorded a new single last week, and will record an album next month.</p>
        <p>''I took two weeks off,'' she said.</p>
        <p>So where did she go?</p>
        <p>''I didn't go anywhere because I couldn't stand the sight of another airplane,'' she replied.</p>
