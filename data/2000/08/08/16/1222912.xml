        <p>Declaring that the outcome of the Microsoft antitrust case could affect nearly every person who uses a computer, the Justice Department urged the Supreme Court yesterday to hear the company's appeal quickly so ''that justice is not denied through delay.''</p>
        <p>The Supreme Court can hear direct appeals in civil antitrust cases brought by the federal government if it thinks the expedited review is in the national interest.</p>
        <p>In its filing yesterday, the Justice Department argued forcefully that the Microsoft lawsuit is surely such a case. ''A lengthy appeals process,'' the government stated, ''could irreparably harm competition in a vital and rapidly evolving sector of the national economy.''</p>
        <p>Last month, Microsoft asked the court to let its appeal go first to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which had ruled for the company in a related case. Microsoft said the appeals court was the proper place for an initial review because the company's appeal raised many technical issues and argued that the trial judge made a series of procedural errors.</p>
        <p>Microsoft will file a legal brief with the Supreme Court on Tuesday, seeking to undermine the arguments the government made yesterday.</p>
        <p>With its filing, the Justice Department essentially tried to make it more difficult for the Supreme Court to decline a direct review. It characterized Microsoft's arguments as all but an insult to the court's competence. Microsoft, the government stated, ''overstates the complexity of this case'' and ''underestimates this court's capabilities.''</p>
        <p>The government also suggested that if the court declined, it would leave the antitrust Expediting Act of 1903, which was amended in 1974, as a dead letter.</p>
        <p>From 1903 until 1974, all appeals of civil antitrust cases brought by the government went directly to the Supreme Court, but the 1974 amendment gave the court more discretion in which appeals it heard directly. The standard, under the 1974 amendment, is that the case should be of ''general public importance in the administration of justice.''</p>
        <p>In pointed language, the government told the court: ''The stakes in this case for the national economy are immense. If this case does not qualify for direct review under the Expediting Act, it is difficult to imagine what future case would.''</p>
        <p>Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who heard the lawsuit in Federal District Court, ruled this year that Microsoft was a monopoly that had repeatedly violated the nation's antitrust laws. And he ordered that the company be split in two, an order he later shelved pending appeals. Microsoft is appealing both Judge Jackson's ruling and his breakup order.</p>
        <p>The votes of four of the Supreme Court's nine justices would be needed for the court to hear an expedited appeal. If the case went directly to the Supreme Court, it could be resolved in a year. If it went first to the appeals court, the resolution could take up to two years.</p>
        <p>The Supreme Court's decision on whether to hear the appeal directly could well be crucial to the outcome and the impact of the Microsoft case, legal experts say.</p>
        <p>If the court proceeded with a direct appeal, they say, it would be a favorable sign for the government. The government would avoid a federal appeals court where Microsoft has done well in the past. And a move for expedited treatment would suggest that the court wanted to resolve a pressing problem quickly.</p>
        <p>''If the Supreme Court's instinct is that Microsoft is a monopoly whose activities are costly to society, it will be more likely to take the case directly,'' said Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor at the University of Iowa law school. ''But if not, then the cost of lingering is not so high, and then it will be more likely to let the appeals court review the case first.''</p>
        <p>The effect of any sanctions against Microsoft, assuming it lost the case on appeal, would probably be dulled by an additional year of delay. ''For that reason, this is a decisive moment in the litigation,'' said William Kovacic, a professor at the George Washington University law school.</p>
        <p>In its filing, the government addressed that issue, noting, ''Delay will postpone, and likely complicate substantially, the restoration of competition in the affected high-technology industries, which evolve at an extraordinary pace.''</p>
