        <p>Monster.com in Maynard, Mass., the job-search Web site operated by TMP Worldwide, said yesterday that it had narrowed a review for its American account to four finalists. Billings were estimated at $75 million to $90 million.</p>
        <p>Judy Neer, executive vice president at Pile and Company in Boston, which is managing the review, said the finalists were Arnold Communications in Boston, part of Snyder Communications, which is being acquired by Havas Advertising; the New York office of BBDO Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group; Mullen in Wenham, Mass., part of the Lowe Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, the incumbent for two years; and Wieden &amp; Kennedy in Portland, Ore. One unidentified agency was eliminated from the review. A final decision is expected at the end of the month.</p>
