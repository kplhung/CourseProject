        <p>The annualized inflation rate in Ireland last month rose to a 15-year high of 6.2 percent, up from 5.5 percent in June. A 17 percent increase in tobacco prices was the single largest contributor to the growth, followed by housing and transportation. In an attempt to assuage continued agitation from trade unions over the issue, the government said that the increase was not unexpected and that it would consider taking further anti-inflationary measures. The government already has imposed some limits on housing prices to cool the inflation rate, which is the highest in the European Union.</p>
