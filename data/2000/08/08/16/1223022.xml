        <p>Dennis Cook was careful yesterday not to complain about his recent workload. On Monday, after a four-day layoff, Cook became the only Mets reliever this season to allow six runs in a game.

        <p>''As a manager you have to go with the guys that have the hot hand, and I would say Johnny and Rick and Turk and Armando have the hot hand right now,'' Cook said of the relievers John Franco, Rick White, Turk Wendell and Armando Benitez.</p>

        <p>Dennis Cook was careful yesterday not to complain about his recent workload. On Monday, after a four-day layoff, Cook became the only Mets reliever this season to allow six runs in a game. He retired only one of the eight batters he faced and saw his earned run average rise to 6.50. Manager Bobby Valentine said Cook's lack of work probably affected his rhythm and fastball.</p>
        <p>''As a manager you have to go with the guys that have the hot hand, and I would say Johnny and Rick and Turk and Armando have the hot hand right now,'' Cook said of the relievers John Franco, Rick White, Turk Wendell and Armando Benitez.</p>
        <p>Cook faced one batter in the first game of yesterday's doubleheader, retiring Larry Walker on a groundout in the seventh inning. Cook (6-2), who was credited with the victory when the Mets scored four runs in the bottom of the inning, said he still believed Valentine has confidence in him.</p>
        <p>''This is not about making Dennis Cook happy,'' Cook said. ''This is about winning games. I'm going to be the happiest man in the world at the end of the season if I have a seven E.R.A. and we win the World Series. If I'm the guy that has to go down there and mop up for that to happen, then so be it.''</p>
        <p>Valentine was not concerned about Cook's E.R.A, since he argued that the statistic can be deceiving for relief pitchers. Earlier this season, Valentine explained that Cook had been used either too often or not enough, but yesterday Valentine said that that was the nature of a reliever's job. He did concede that Cook's workload has been sporadic since the Mets acquired White on July 27. White, who carried a 0.84 E.R.A. with the Mets into the doubleheader, has joined Wendell in middle relief, a move Cook said he understands.</p>
        <p>''I have the same stuff, but good mechanics come with consistent work, and I would say I'm not where I want to be with my mechanics right now,'' Cook said. ''I've had stretches of being very good but when I've been bad, I've been very bad this year.''</p>
        <p>Cook has been scored upon in 17 of the 51 games he has appeared in this season.</p>
        <p>''If he's pitched 10 times, 6 times have been outstanding, 2 times have been average, and one time had been bad and has been a little less than average,'' Valentine said.</p>
        <p>Plans for Perez</p>
        <p>The Mets are considering promoting center fielder Timoniel Perez from Class AAA Norfolk when rosters expand next month, Jim Duquette, an assistant general manager, said this week.</p>
        <p>Perez, who was born in the Dominican Republic but had been playing in Japan, has been a revelation since another assistant general manager, Omar Minaya, signed him during spring training. He was promoted from Class A St. Lucie to Norfolk to temporarily fill Jason Tyner's roster spot in June, but he kept himself there with his hitting and has worked his way into the Mets' plans.</p>
        <p>Perez was batting .356 with six homers and nine steals before last night's game. Duquette said he would be used as a pinch-runner and defensive replacement, but the Mets would need to find a way to get him onto the 40-man roster.</p>
        <p>Rockies' Helton Impresses</p>
        <p>No one has hit over .400 since Ted Williams batted .406 in 1941, but Bobby Valentine would not be surprised to see another .400 hitter.</p>
        <p>''I think someone will hit .400 before someone hits in 56 straight games,'' Valentine said.</p>
        <p>The Rockies' Todd Helton is batting .396 after going 4 for 8 with three doubles last night.</p>
        <p>''He's got superstar written all over him, not only the way he swings the bat and plays the field but his attitude,'' said Mets outfielder Darryl Hamilton, who played with Helton in Colorado. ''It's not a secret that I wasn't too happy with the attitude in Colorado, but I can honestly say Todd Helton was not one of the guys you can put that on.''</p>
        <p>Hamilton said he was impressed by how Helton, who had a locker next to him, would react to losing as a rookie. Instead of settling for his own statistics, Helton became upset, Hamilton said.</p>
        <p>But the Rockies have followed a fast start this season with a midsummer slump, allowing Helton to concentrate on hitting. He had 29 homers and 102 runs batted in after Game 1.</p>
        <p>''He probably says, 'Hey, I might as well go out and win a batting title now since we can't win,' '' said Lenny Harris, who played for Colorado last season.</p>
