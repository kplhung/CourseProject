        <p>NORTHERN IRELAND: OMAGH REMEMBRANCE -- A ceremony commemorated the second anniversary of 29 deaths in a bombing carried out in Omagh by the Irish Republican Army splinter group the Real I.R.A. Prime Ministers Bertie Ahern of Ireland and Tony Blair of Britain pledged continued support for the investigation into the bombing. In March the Irish police commissioner, Pat Byrne, said the police knew those responsible but lacked evidence to bring charges.</p>

        <p>SPAIN: POLICE DETONATE CAR BOMB -- The police used a robot to blow up a car carrying 220 pounds of explosives, which was found abandoned on a highway near Huesca at the foot of the Pyrenees. Police officials suspected that the car bomb had been prepared by the Basque separatist group E.T.A., four of whose members died last week when explosives blew up in their car.</p>

        <p>ITALY: POPE AND YOUTH -- John Paul II opened a six-day World Youth Festival, one of the largest events of the Roman Catholic Holy Year, by greeting more than 700,000 young believers crammed in front of St. Peter's and the Basilica of St. John Lateran. When the crowd chanted, ''Long live the pope,'' the frail John Paul, buoyed by the exuberance, joked that although he had already been alive 80 years, youth wanted him always to be young. ''What to do?'' he asked.</p>

        <p>COLOMBIA: CHILDREN DIE IN SHOOTOUT -- Four children were killed and seven wounded when their school group was caught in the cross-fire of Marxist rebels fighting the army near the town of Pueblo Rico in Antioquia province. An army officer accused the rebel National Liberation Army of using the children as human shields.</p>

        <p>TAIWAN: CHARGES IN TOXIC-WASTE CASE -- Three chemical company executives and 19 workers were charged with dumping tons of toxic waste into a river that serves as a main source of drinking water in southern Taiwan. Authorities in Kao-hsiung shut down the water supply for four days last month after three men were caught pouring a cancer-causing solvent, dimethyl benzene, into a tributary of the Kaoping River from a tanker.</p>

        <p>CHINA: DISSIDENT RELEASED -- Liu Wensheng, who founded a democratic party and was active in the 1989 student movement, was released last week after serving eight years of a 10-year sentence, Mr. Liu and a Hong Kong-based rights group announced. ''Had there not been outside pressure on my behalf, I would not have been released,'' Mr. Liu said. His name was on a list that American labor groups had submitted to Congress in an effort to deny China permanent normal trade status.</p>
        <p>(Agence France-Presse)</p>
        <p>JAPAN: A NEW WIRETAP LAW -- Japan's first wiretapping law went into effect, allowing authorities to use wiretaps when investigating crimes involving narcotics, guns, gang-related murders and large-scale smuggling of people into the country. Arguing for the law last year, the police had described it as an essential tool in their fight against organized crime. Critics -- mindful of Japan's history as a police state before and during World War II -- had said the wiretapping could be used against political rivals.</p>

        <p>SOUTH KOREA: AMNESTY RECIPIENTS -- Among the 3,586 inmates freed in a general amnesty to mark the anniversary of liberation from Japan's rule, in 1945, were Chung Soo Il, 63, a North Korean spy who had posed as a college professor, and Hong In Kil, an aide to former President Kim Young Sam who was serving a corruption sentence. Almost 24,000 people already released after serving time for minor offenses, regained their civil rights, which means they can run for election and vote. One was Kim Hyun Chul, above, son of former President Kim, who served six months in 1996 on corruption charges.</p>

        <p>INDIA: CHRISTIANS DEMONSTRATE -- Hundreds of Christians, including nuns and schoolchildren, marched in Calcutta to protest a series of church bombings and attacks on Christians over the past year. Some Christian leaders have blamed the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which leads a coalition government, for failing to rein in its hard-line supporters, but party leaders deny involvement.</p>

        <p>SRI LANKA: TAMIL TIGER ATTACK -- The government said Tamil Tiger rebels attacked troops with mortar fire on the Jaffna Peninsula in the north, but the soldiers held on to their defensive positions. The army is bracing itself for a rebel offensive expected before national parliamentary elections to be held by November.</p>

        <p>NIGERIA: 18 DIE IN PIPELINE BLAST -- In the latest in a series of Niger Delta explosions, eighteen people scooping fuel from a leaking pipeline were killed near the southeastern city of Calabar over the weekend. Hundreds have died in recent weeks in similar accidents as a result of black-marketeers' rupturing pipelines to siphon fuel.</p>

        <p>SUDAN: RELIEF IN SIGHT -- The United Nations is to resume aid in Sudan after receiving assurances that flights will not be targets of government bombers. United Nations aid operations there were suspended last week after several bombings on flights in the rebel-controlled south.</p>

        <p>IRAN: BILL ON NEWSPAPERS -- After an order from Iran's supreme leader to drop a debate on press freedom, reformist lawmakers presented a bill that aims to block the hard-line judiciary from closing reformist newspapers. The legislators sought a debate on whether it was legal to close papers under the Security Measures Law, the official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted a lawmaker as saying. ''Several courts have closed the dailies on the basis of this law,'' the legislator, Gholam Heidar Ebrahimbai Salami, said, adding, ''Clarification in this case would remove many ambiguities.''</p>
