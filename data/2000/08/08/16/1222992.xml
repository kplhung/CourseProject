        <p>Robert Shrum, the Gore strategist who has written some of the most eloquent Democratic speeches of his generation, said yesterday that Mr. Gore was ''literally, truly and unquestionably'' the author of the acceptance speech he will give to the Democratic convention tomorrow  night. With no help at all from Mr. Shrum, who wrote much of Senator Edward M. Kennedy's ''dream shall never die'' speech that ignited the 1980 Democratic convention in New York?</p>
        <p>''He is writing his own speech,'' Mr. Shrum repeated by phone from Michigan, where he was traveling with the vice president.

        <p>Robert Shrum, the Gore strategist who has written some of the most eloquent Democratic speeches of his generation, said yesterday that Mr. Gore was ''literally, truly and unquestionably'' the author of the acceptance speech he will give to the Democratic convention tomorrow  night. With no help at all from Mr. Shrum, who wrote much of Senator Edward M. Kennedy's ''dream shall never die'' speech that ignited the 1980 Democratic convention in New York?</p>
        <p>''He is writing his own speech,'' Mr. Shrum repeated by phone from Michigan, where he was traveling with the vice president. Mr. Shrum added that Mr. Gore, a former journalist, was ''an excellent writer --  he's got a very real sense of imaging and the sounds and balance of language.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Shrum did advise Mr. Kennedy on his convention speech last night. Mr. Shrum also said that when he wrote Mr. Kennedy's most famous oratorical line -- ''the dream shall never die'' -- the idea ''basically just came out of the air.''</p>
        <p>So Little Time</p>
        <p>Chaos reigns at Hadassah Lieberman's office at the Biltmore Hotel. Phones keep ringing. Calls are unanswered. An abrupt decision by the Gore campaign asking Mrs. Lieberman to nominate her husband, Joseph, as vice president at the convention has thrown her small staff into turmoil. Interviews are canceled or rearranged. Speechwriters work in the Lieberman suite.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Lieberman's role in the coming campaign is still under discussion by the Gore and Lieberman staffs. But, they say, she will probably move out alone on the campaign trail, without her husband, just like Lynne V. Cheney, the wife of Dick Cheney, the Republican vice-presidential nominee.</p>
        <p>''Hadassah's got a great story to tell, a really compelling story,'' said Dan Gerstein, Mr. Lieberman's spokesman. ''She's the daughter of Holocaust survivors. Her mother was liberated by American G.I.'s at Dachau. The fact that she'll be on the stage at this convention is a powerful testament to the American dream.''</p>
        <p>Almost as soon as Mr. Lieberman was selected, the Gore campaign asked Sally Aman, who had worked more than four years as Tipper Gore's communications director, to serve in a similar role with Mrs. Lieberman. Before this, Mrs. Lieberman had never had a staff of her own.</p>
        <p>Is Mrs. Lieberman, who has not spoken much publicly, nervous about appearing before the convention? ''It's perfectly normal to be nervous, and she is,'' Ms. Aman said. ''But she's talking about a subject she knows very well. Her husband.''</p>
        <p>What'd He Say?</p>
        <p>The coda of President Clinton's speech to the convention on Monday night carried an unscripted -- and unexpected -- phrase that confused some newspapers.</p>
        <p>Departing from his prepared text, as he often does, Mr. Clinton added a sentence in the final paragraph, saying, ''And remember, whenever you think about me, keep putting people first.'' The White House quoted Mr. Clinton as making the comment. And people listening to the speech agreed.</p>
        <p>But others who heard the speech said that was not correct. They said they had heard Mr. Clinton say: ''And remember, whatever you think about me . . . '' The word itself sounded blurry.</p>
        <p>The one-word difference, of course, carries an entirely different meaning. One White House aide said he was fairly certain that Mr. Clinton said ''whatever.'' If so, that would be the only reference in the speech to the Lewinsky scandal.</p>
        <p>The aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said, ''It means  'whether you think well of me or not, what's important is the future of the  country.' It means 'don't get distracted by what you think of me personally.' ''</p>
        <p>Newspapers like The New York Daily News and The St. Louis Post-Dispatch used the phrase ''whatever you think of me.'' The New York Times, in its published transcript of the speech, also had ''whatever.''</p>
        <p>But yesterday the White House issued its official transcript of the remarks, and it said ''whenever.'' A team of New York Times editors listened to a tape of the speech and agreed that the president had said ''whenever.'' Whatever.</p>
        <p>Just Two Pals</p>
        <p>Certain East and West Coast eyebrows were raised when Senator Robert G. Torricelli was spotted walking across the convention floor on Monday night with his onetime close friend Patricia Duff, former wife of the Revlon billionaire Ronald O. Perelman and the former Tristar Pictures chairman Mike Medavoy. There had been numerous tabloid reports of a Torricelli-Duff split.</p>
        <p>Were they back together? Mr. Torricelli would not say. ''There is a bond between all the Democrats who were on the convention floor,'' Mr. Torricelli pleasantly replied, 'but it is something short of marriage.'' Ms. Duff, who has been through an ugly, highly publicized child custody battle with Mr. Perelman, was one of Bill Clinton's first and biggest fund-raisers in Hollywood.</p>
        <p>The First Friend's Report</p>
        <p>Terry McAuliffe, Clinton fund-raiser extraordinaire and close presidential pal, got the first hug after Mr. Clinton finished his convention speech. Holding court with reporters yesterday after speaking to a breakfast meeting of the New York delegation at the Century Plaza Hotel, Mr. McAuliffe said that after Mr. Clinton leaves the presidency, ''he has no interest in making money.'' That remark may be of some interest to Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has worried about the couple's extraordinary legal bills.</p>
        <p>Mr. McAuliffe also said that the retired Mr. Clinton would spend a third of his time with his presidential library in Little Rock, a third traveling and a third in New York. As to whether the Clintons would keep their home in Chappaqua, N.Y. -- the loan for it was temporarily guaranteed by Mr. McAuliffe -- the presidential fund-raiser replied: ''You'll have to talk to the first lady and the president about their plans. They've got their own mortgage now. They don't need me.''</p>
        <p>Stopping Traffic</p>
        <p>The model Christie Brinkley, a member of the New York delegation, caused such a traffic jam of television cameras on the convention floor on Monday night that security guards finally asked her to move into the hallway so they could clear the aisles.</p>
        <p>''I wonder why,'' H. Carl McCall, the state comptroller, dryly observed.</p>
        <p>Eliot Spitzer, the state attorney general, was among a throng of New York delegates and elected officials left in the shadows with the departure of Ms. Brinkley and her klieg lights. ''This shows the proper media understanding of how politics works,'' Mr. Spitzer said.</p>
