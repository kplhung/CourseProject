        <p>Following are excerpts from the platform approved yesterday by the Democratic National Convention.</p>
        <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
        <p>Today, America finds itself in the midst of prosperity, progress and peace. We have arrived at this moment because of the hard work of the American people. This election will be about the big choices we have to make to secure prosperity that is broadly shared and progress that reaches all families in this new American century. In the year 2000, the Democratic Party stands ready to meet that challenge and to build on our achievements. . . .</p>
        <p>If one theme runs through this 2000 Democratic platform, it is this: if America is to secure prosperity, progress, peace and security for all, we cannot afford to go back. We must move forward together and we must not leave anyone behind.</p>
        <p>PROSPERITY</p>
        <p>Democrats believe that to further our prosperity and make sure all Americans are ready to reap the rewards of the new economy we need thinking as innovative as the moment in which we live. First, we must continue the fiscal discipline that has been the hallmark of the past eight years -- that means paying down the debt and offering the right kind of tax cuts. Second, we must use our unprecedented prosperity to secure Social Security and Medicare for future generations. Third, we must invest in the most precious resource we have -- the American people and their skills and ability to innovate. Fourth, we must continue to reinvent government so that it works better and costs less and is in line with the online world. Fifth, we must open new markets to American products at home and around the world. Finally, we must reinforce the basic American bargain of requiring and rewarding hard work and we must provide Americans with the opportunity to participate in key decisions at work and in their communities. . . .</p>
        <p>Retirement Security</p>
        <p>Al Gore is committed to making Social Security safe and secure for more than half a century by using the savings from our current unprecedented prosperity to strengthen the Social Security trust fund in preparation for the retirement of the baby boom generation. We now have an extraordinary opportunity to maintain Social Security. In addition, we can reform it, not the wrong way, with proposals such as raising the retirement age, but the right way, with fiscal discipline and by making it fairer for widows, widowers and mothers.</p>
        <p>Retirement security comes on many fronts. Democrats have successfully passed reforms to simplify the pension process for small businesses, expand pension portability and protect employee pension funds. Democrats believe that workers' pensions should be protected and more portable. We also believe that changes in every American's pension rights should be fully disclosed. This is becoming increasingly important today, as pensions are progressively being shifted from a workers' benefit plan to a workers' contribution plan. We believe these changes need to be carefully examined by independent agencies to make sure they abide by current federal law. Democrats support President Clinton's veto of the Republican tax scheme that would have diminished antidiscrimination protections for middle-class and lower-income workers.</p>
        <p>To build on the success of Social Security, Al Gore has proposed the creation of retirement savings plus -- voluntary, tax-free, personally controlled, privately managed savings accounts with a government match that would help couples build a nest egg of up to $400,000. Separate from Social Security, retirement savings plus accounts would let Americans save and invest on top of the foundation of Social Security's guaranteed benefit. Under this plan, the federal government would match individual contributions with tax credits, with the hardest-pressed working families getting the most assistance.</p>
        <p>Investing in Americans</p>
        <p>We cannot afford -- materially or morally -- to let another generation of American children pass through inadequate schools before we make needed changes that will save them from a lifetime of frustration and limited horizons. The time for action is now.</p>
        <p>By the end of the next presidential term, we should have a fully qualified, well-trained teacher in every classroom in every school in every part of this country -- and every teacher should pass a rigorous test to get there.</p>
        <p>By the end of the next presidential term, every failing school in America should be turned around or shut down and reopened under new public leadership.</p>
        <p>By the end of the next presidential term, we should ensure that no high school student graduates unless they have mastered the basics of reading and math, so that the diploma they receive really means something.</p>
        <p>By the end of the next presidential term, parents across the nation ought to be able to choose the best public school for their children.</p>
        <p>By the end of the next presidential term, every eighth grader in America should be computer literate.</p>
        <p>By the end of the next presidential term, high-quality, affordable preschool should be fully available to every family, for every child, in every community in America.</p>
        <p>By the end of the next presidential term, every child should learn in a safe, modern classroom with the most up-to-date technology.</p>
        <p>By the end of the next presidential term, the achievement gap between students of color and the rest of America's students should be eliminated.</p>
        <p>Consistently bad schools should be shut down. No excuses. No exceptions. . . . Charter schools and other nontraditional public school options can free school leaders, teachers, parents and community leaders to use their creativity and innovation to help all students meet the highest academic standards. The Democratic Party will triple the number of charter schools in the nation. And we will ensure that these charter schools are fully accountable financially and academically to students and the communities they serve, and that they are indeed making progress in maximizing student achievement. All public schools should have the freedom to design their curriculum within high standards, and all public schools should compete for students -- and we should start by bringing universal public school choice and competition to our lowest-performing public schools.</p>
        <p>Let there be no mistake: what America needs are public schools that compete with one another and are held accountable for results, not private school vouchers that drain resources from public schools and hand over the public's hard-earned tax dollars to private schools with no accountability. . . .</p>
        <p>Opening Markets Around the World</p>
        <p>The president should be able to negotiate trade agreements with the nations of the world and should include worker rights, human rights and environmental protections in those agreements, as well as market-opening initiatives. At the same time, Al Gore will challenge American companies to ensure labor protections and worker safety at their overseas operations. And United States representatives at the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank should also seek to advance fair treatment for workers internationally. We should create an environment in which electronic commerce can flourish globally as it has here in America. We are committed to supporting the rights of workers around the world. And we should vigorously monitor trade agreements to make sure other nations are not shirking their responsibilities. . . .</p>
        <p>PROGRESS</p>
        <p>Fighting Crime</p>
        <p>A shocking level of gun violence on our streets and in our schools has shown America the need to keep guns away from those who shouldn't have them in ways that respect the rights of hunters, sportsmen and legitimate gun owners. The Columbine tragedy struck America's heart, but in its wake Republicans have done nothing to keep guns away from those who should not have them.</p>
        <p>Democrats believe that we should fight gun crime on all fronts, with stronger laws and stronger enforcement. That's why Democrats fought and passed the Brady Law and the assault weapons ban. We increased federal, state and local gun crime prosecution by 22 percent since 1992. Now gun crime is down by 35 percent.</p>
        <p>Now we must do even more. We need mandatory child safety locks, to protect our children. We should require a photo license ID, a full background check and a gun safety test to buy a new handgun in America. We support more federal gun prosecutors, A.T.F. agents and inspectors and giving states and communities another 10,000 prosecutors to fight gun crime.</p>
        <p>Good policing demands mutual trust and respect between the community and the police. We shouldn't let the acts of a few rogue officers undermine that trust or the reputation of the outstanding work of the vast majority of our dedicated men and women in blue. That is why we need to end the unjust practice of racial profiling in America -- because it's not only unfair, it is inconsistent with America's community policing success, it is a violation of the basic American principle of innocent until proven guilty, it views Americans as members of groups instead of as individuals, and it is just plain shoddy policing. . . .</p>
        <p>Universal Health Coverage</p>
        <p>We must redouble our efforts to bring the uninsured into coverage step-by-step and as soon as possible. We should guarantee access to affordable health care for every child in America. We should expand coverage to working families, including more Medicaid assistance to help with the transition from welfare to work. And we should also seek to ensure that dislocated workers are provided affordable health care. We should make health care accessible and affordable for small businesses. In addition, Americans aged 55 to 65 -- the fastest growing group of uninsured -- should be allowed to buy into the Medicare program to get the coverage they need. By taking these steps, we can move our nation closer to the goal of providing universal health coverage for all Americans.</p>
        <p>A Real Patients' Bill of Rights</p>
        <p>Medical decisions should be made by patients and their doctors and nurses, not accountants and bureaucrats at the end of a phone line a thousand miles away. It is time we meaningfully addressed concerns about the quality of care and about the decline of patient access, trust and satisfaction. People need to get the health care they need, when they need it, without having to leap endless hurdles. Americans need a real, enforceable patients' bill of rights with the right to see a specialist, the right to appeal decisions to an outside board, guaranteed coverage of emergency room care and the right to sue when they are unfairly denied coverage. . . .</p>
        <p>Protecting and Strengthening Medicare</p>
        <p>It is time we ended the tragedy of elderly Americans being forced to choose between meals and medication. It is time we modernized Medicare with a new prescription drug benefit. This is an essential step in making sure that the best new cures and therapies are available to our seniors and disabled Americans. We cannot afford to permit our seniors to receive only part of the medical care they need.</p>
        <p>Democrats believe Medicare is worth fighting for and worth saving. With the number of Americans on Medicare expected to double in the next 35 years, Al Gore has stepped up and taken responsibility by proposing a Medicare lock box that would ensure Medicare surpluses are used for Medicare -- and not for pork barrel spending or tax giveaways. We should also modernize Medicare by promoting competitive prices and remain vigilant against Medicare fraud.</p>
        <p>Choice</p>
        <p>The Democratic Party stands behind the right of every woman to choose, consistent with Roe v. Wade, and regardless of ability to pay. We believe it is a fundamental constitutional liberty that individual Americans --  not government -- can best take responsibility for making the most difficult and intensely personal decisions regarding reproduction. This year's Supreme Court rulings show to us all that eliminating a woman's right to choose is only one justice away. That's why the stakes in this election are as high as ever.</p>
        <p>Our goal is to make abortion less necessary and more rare, not more difficult and more dangerous. We support contraceptive research, family planning, comprehensive family life education and policies that support healthy childbearing. The abortion rate is dropping. Now we must continue to support efforts to reduce unintended pregnancies, and we call on all Americans to take personal responsibility to meet this important goal.</p>
        <p>The Democratic Party is a party of inclusion. We respect the individual conscience of each American on this difficult issue, and we welcome all our members to participate at every level of our party. This is why we are proud to put into our platform the very words which Republicans refused to let Bob Dole put into their 1996 platform and which they refused to even consider putting in their platform in 2000: ''While the party remains steadfast in its commitment to advancing its historic principles and ideals, we also recognize that members of our party have deeply held and sometimes differing views on issues of personal conscience like abortion and capital punishment. We view this diversity of views as a source of strength, not as a sign of weakness, and we welcome into our ranks all Americans who may hold differing positions on these and other issues. Recognizing that tolerance is a virtue, we are committed to resolving our differences in a spirit of civility, hope and mutual respect.''</p>
        <p>Protecting Our Environment</p>
        <p>Al Gore is committed to restoring the Everglades, protecting the coasts of California and Florida and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge from oil and gas drilling and preserving our untouched forests, including the Tongass, from logging and development. With regard to public lands, Democrats believe that communities, environmental interests and government agencies should work together to protect our public resources, critical habitat areas and wildlands while ensuring the vitality of local economies. We will work together to find land-based alternatives and decontamination technologies that will permanently end the ocean disposal of contaminated dredge spoils. . . .</p>
        <p>We should invest in roads, bridges, light rail systems, cleaner buses, the aviation system, our national passenger railroad, Amtrak, and high-speed trains that would give Americans choices freeing them from traffic, smog-choked cities and being held hostage to foreign oil. We should ensure that urban communities affected by the presence of airports which create increased levels of noise and pollution be provided mitigation support to address these concerns. We must also ensure that we maintain adequate public funding and public administration of publicly operated and delivered transportation services, without gutting collective bargaining agreements or longstanding worker protections. In these and other areas, we will encourage project labor agreements, fostering labor-management cooperation, quality development and efficient use of public monies. Today, technology has advanced to the point that we can drive the kind of cars we like and live in the kind of houses we like -- while being kind to the earth. We should use some of our budget surplus to help Americans take advantage of these new opportunities. With the right investments, these new environmentally friendly technologies can create new jobs for American workers. . . .</p>
        <p>And we must dramatically reduce climate-disrupting and health-threatening pollution in this country, while making sure that all nations of the world participate in this effort. Environmental standards should be raised throughout the world in order to preserve the earth and to prevent a destructive race to the bottom wherein countries compete for production and jobs based on who can do the least to protect the environment. There will be no new bureaucracies, no new agencies, no new organizations. But there will be action and there will be progress. The earth truly is in the balance -- and we are the guardians of that harmony.  . . .</p>
        <p>Renewing Our Democracy and Campaign Finance Reform</p>
        <p>In this year's presidential primaries, it became clear that the Republican establishment is violently opposed to John McCain's call for reforming our democracy. Al Gore supports John McCain's campaign for political reform. In fact, the McCain-Feingold bill is the very first piece of legislation that a President Al Gore will submit to Congress, and he will fight for it until it becomes the law of the land.</p>
        <p>Then he will go even further -- much further. He will insist on tough new lobbying reform, publicly guaranteed TV time for debates and advocacy by candidates and a crackdown on special interest issue ads. Most boldly of all, Al Gore has proposed a public-private, nonpartisan Democracy Endowment which will raise money from Americans and finance Congressional elections, with no other contributions allowed to candidates who accept the funding. This will let our politics be free from the influence of special interests and let Americans believe in their own democracy again. . . .</p>
        <p>PEACE</p>
        <p>Al Gore and the Democratic Party know that we must be able to meet any military challenge from a position of dominance. But Al Gore and the Democratic Party also recognize that there is a new security agenda -- threats that affect the entire world and transcend political borders.</p>
        <p>During the past century, we have learned that if we wish to avoid war, we must be strong enough to deter aggression, but also farsighted enough to invest in peace. Now it is time to apply this lesson to the new global challenges we face, to shape a new strategy of forward engagement to guide our conduct around the world. Forward engagement means addressing problems early in their development before they become crises, addressing them as close to the source of the problem as possible and having the forces and resources to deal with these threats as soon after their emergence as possible. . . .</p>
        <p>Protecting Our Interests and Securing Our Values</p>
        <p>The lessons of the past eight years show that the nation must be prepared to use force when American interests and values are truly at stake. We cannot be the world's policeman, and we must be discriminating in our approach. But where the stakes are high, when we can assure ourselves that nothing short of military engagement can secure our national interest, when we know that we have the military forces available for the task, when we have made our best efforts to join with allies, and when the cost is proportionate to the objective, we must be ready to act. . . .</p>
        <p>Engaging Former Enemies</p>
        <p>Democrats understand that we must engage former enemies. This administration's efforts to design new relationships with the Russian Federation and China have been continuously subjected to every form of harassment and attack by the Republicans, but they have been in America's national interest and they have been the right thing to do.</p>
        <p>We recognize that Russia's historic transition to a market democracy is difficult, all the more reason we must continue to engage Russia. We recognize that Russian democracy is challenged by corruption that deeply penetrates her society, all the more reason to engage Russia on behalf of reform. We recognize that Russia has her own self-interest and concerns that can and do run contrary to ours, all the more reason to search for constructive forms of cooperation. We deeply disagree with what Russia is doing in Chechnya and remain concerned about signs of Russian efforts to intimidate the press, all the more reason to step up our discussions with them on those issues. The Democratic Party is prepared to pursue American objectives as needed even at the cost of friction with Russia. But it is also of tremendous potential benefit to us if we can nurture a sense of common purpose and trust. . . .</p>
        <p>Similarly, we must continue to engage China -- a nation with 1.3 billion people, a nuclear arsenal, and a role in the 21st century that is destined to be one of the basic facts of international life. We must search out ways to cooperate across a broad range of issues, such as the environment and trade, while at the same time insisting on adherence to international standards on human rights, freedom, the persecution of religions, the suppression of Tibet and bellicose threats directed at Taiwan. . . .</p>
        <p>Preventing New Physical Threats</p>
        <p>We reject Republican plans to endanger our security with massive unilateral cuts in our arsenal and to construct an unproven, expensive and ill-conceived missile defense system that would plunge us into a new arms race. Al Gore and the Democratic Party support the development of the technology for a limited national missile defense system that will be able to defend the United States against a missile attack from a state that has acquired weapons of mass destruction despite our efforts to block their proliferation. A decision to deploy such a system should be made based on four criteria: the nature of the threat, the feasibility of the technology, the cost and the overall impact on our national security, including arms control. The Democratic Party places a high value on ensuring that any such system is compatible with the Antiballistic Missile Treaty. We also support continued work in significantly reducing strategic and other nuclear weapons, recognizing that the goal is strategic nuclear stability at progressively lower levels.</p>
