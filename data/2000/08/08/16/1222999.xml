        <p>As if the computer business was not cutthroat enough, Compaq Computer has decided to enter another industry with rabid competition and elusive profits: consumer electronics. Yesterday, Compaq introduced several devices meant to be grown-up toys this holiday season, using a new iPaq brand. There is a $249 sleek silver portable MP3 player, a $599 kitchen-white Internet access terminal, and a $499 round black pod that will run a home network. Compaq hopes the devices will produce revenue beyond their purchase prices. The MP3 player's software directs users to find downloads at CMGI's Icast site, which pays Compaq for new users. And the Internet terminal requires users to sign up for the $21.95-a-month MSN service from Microsoft, which shares revenue with Compaq. One source: an ad box that is permanently located in the bottom right corner of the screen.</p>
