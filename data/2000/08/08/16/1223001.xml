        <p>Jupiter Communications, an Internet research firm, plans to release a report today forecasting that online advertising revenue will reach $16.5 billion by 2005. The report predicts a 30 percent annual growth rate in total online advertising spending, from $3.5 billion in 1999. According to a Jupiter survey, marketers plan to increase spending on Internet advertising at a higher rate than advertising in any other medium, with nearly three-quarters planning increases in the next 12 months, compared with 43 percent who said they would increase their magazine spending and 37 percent who plan to increase their spending on cable television. This anticipated growth could propel the Internet to fourth place as an advertising medium, behind broadcast television, radio and newspapers.</p>
