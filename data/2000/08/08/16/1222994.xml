        <p>Just as Robin Wilson settled into her sofa to watch President Clinton's speech to Democrats on Monday, her telephone rang.</p>
        <p>It was Howard Ellis, an old co-worker, calling so he and Mrs. Wilson, a 67-year-old retired postal employee, could talk about the speech as they watched it.</p>
        <p>''That charisma just shines,'' Mrs. Wilson told her friend as the president spoke about his humble roots and how grateful he was for his time in office. ''It's a shame that he can't run again.''</p>
        <p>''It sure is,'' Mr. Ellis responded.</p>
        <p>In the living rooms of Chicago's western suburbs, even independent voters said the speech made them a bit nostalgic. There was even some new fondness for Hillary Rodham Clinton, who spoke to the convention crowd before her husband.</p>
        <p>But although most of the half-dozen viewers who were interviewed seemed to feel warmth toward the Clintons, they were more subdued about their hopes for the Democrat vying to be his successor, Vice President Al Gore. Some even said the president's performance made Mr. Gore's task more difficult.</p>
        <p>''Oh, I suppose I'll vote for Gore,'' Mrs. Wilson said with a labored sigh that spoke more ambivalence than enthusiasm. ''But my heart's not in it.''</p>
        <p>Even a Republican like David King, though, a 35-year-old computer software worker, sounded like a fan of President Clinton's after the speech.</p>
        <p>''Boy, I was really impressed,''  Mr. King said. ''The way he rebutted every single point at the Republican convention -- saying the good economy was a choice, not a chance -- that was awfully effective.''</p>
        <p>In Mr. King's view, the Democrats can scarcely take credit for all the nation's prosperity in recent years. The ascension of the Internet, he said, probably had more to do with soaring stock prices and dwindling unemployment than any policies directed by the White House.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Clinton's closing argument, as he called it, could make even a skeptical juror think twice.</p>
        <p>''He was just very persuasive,'' Mr. King said. ''That part where he asked people to look at the economy now, and remember it eight years ago, it does make you think.''</p>
        <p>Not every convention viewer was so inspired, of course. Dr. Ann Gose, 62, a cardiovascular surgeon, said she was mostly struck by what she considered the president's profound self-centeredness.</p>
        <p>''He goes on and on about his wife and Gore, but it eventually comes back to himself, like it always does with this guy,'' Dr. Gose said. ''You watch him, and it's like he couldn't let go. He needs all this. I feel sorry for him.''</p>
        <p>And Charles Grimm, an engineering salesman in his 60's, was throwing no bouquets at his television set.</p>
        <p>''Looking at him makes me ill,'' said Mr. Grimm, an ex-marine who said he had detested Mr. Clinton from the start of his presidency and had grown to loathe him even more.</p>
        <p>''He gives a good speech, no doubt about it,'' Mr. Grimm said. ''But it's all sound bites. And I just can't believe anything he says.''</p>
        <p>The speech by Mrs. Clinton, who is running for the United States Senate in New York, did not seem to provoke such visceral reactions, positive or negative, among the Chicago suburbanites. But several said they were a bit surprised to find her likable, especially in light of the portrait her detractors paint of her as conniving, bloodless and power hungry.</p>
        <p>Teri Turek, a 36-year-old insurance clerk, said she was struck by Mrs. Clinton's sense of compassion.  ''I didn't really like her before,'' said Ms. Turek, a political independent. ''But when she talked, she seemed so totally for family, for children. And she was sincere. She looked you in the eye.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Turek added, ''And you've got to respect her for being such a go-getter, considering everything that he's put her through.''</p>
        <p>Even Mr. Grimm had nice things to say about Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>''She came across a little better than I thought she would, strong and sincere,'' Mr. Grimm said. In particular, he gave her high marks for praising Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, who had been critical of Mr. Clinton's sexual relationship with a young White House intern.</p>
        <p>On one point, each viewer agreed: It was a relief that neither the president nor Mrs. Clinton talked about the scandal that nearly drove him from office. None of them wanted any displays of contrition or public appeals, as one put it, ''for some kind of closure.''</p>
        <p>Carrie Addison, 44, who owns a convenience-store franchise, just groaned at the mention of Mr. Clinton's moral lapses. ''We've had enough about that,'' Ms. Addison said, a sentiment that was expressed by every one of the voters. ''It's over and done with.''</p>
        <p>Whether these voters considered Mr. Clinton to be a star or a villain, it was clear that they saw him as the headline attraction, drawing attention from Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Grimm saw it, ''Clinton is going to completely overshadow Gore.''</p>
        <p>And despite the president's repeated mention of Mr. Gore as his full partner in the White House, these voters expressed skepticism that White House policies were much influenced by the second in command.</p>
        <p>''The things that were put through, that was President Clinton,'' Mrs. Wilson said. ''And you get the feeling, that's all over now.''</p>
        <p>Having taped the speech for her grandchildren, she said: ''He was witty, funny, to the point. I like what he said about building one America. And I think he really means that. I feel kind of sad, really.''</p>
