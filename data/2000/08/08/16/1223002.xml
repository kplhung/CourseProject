        <p>A college professor in Ohio has drawn the unwelcome attention of one of Mexico's most powerful families.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for a bank controlled by the family of a Mexican billionaire, Carlos Hank Gonzalez -- a former mayor of Mexico City -- say that Donald E. Schulz leaked a secret Justice Department document last year that described the Hank family as a ''significant criminal threat'' and linked it to large-scale drug trafficking and money laundering.</p>
        <p>A lawsuit, filed late today in federal court in Cleveland, alleges that Mr. Schulz, who is now chairman of the political science department at Cleveland State University, leaked copies of the report to newspapers last year.</p>
        <p>The plaintiffs in that suit are Laredo National Bancshares Inc. of Laredo, Texas, and the bank's president and chief executive officer, Gary G. Jacobs. The bank's chairman and controlling shareholder is Carlos Hank Rhon, the eldest son of Carlos Hank Gonzalez. He is not a plaintiff in the suit, however.</p>
        <p>The suit, which asks for unspecified damages, is an early salvo in what is expected to be a long and coordinated counterattack by the Hank family, one of the wealthiest and most politically influential clans in Mexico, against allegations that it is involved in the illegal drug trade. The family also faces scrutiny by regulators at the Federal Reserve, who are examining Carlos Hank Rhon's ownership of the Laredo bank.</p>
        <p>The report, which was produced by the National Drug Intelligence Center, an agency within the Justice Department, was cited last year in articles in newspapers including The Washington Post and The Dallas Morning News at a time when Congress was debating the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act. The law, which Congress later passed, gives the government the power to freeze bank accounts and other assets of persons it labels significant drug traffickers.</p>
        <p>The report alleged the Hank family was involved in money laundering and drug trafficking, and implied that it was protected because of its strong ties to the Institutional Revolutionary Party, according to the news reports. Known as PRI, the political machine dominated Mexican politics until this year, when the National Action Party's candidate, Vicente Fox, defeated the PRI's candidate in the presidential election.</p>
        <p>After the report was disclosed, the Hank family mobilized to rebut the allegations, hiring high-profile lawyers including Warren Rudman, the former New Hampshire senator.  Earlier this year, Attorney General Janet Reno disavowed the report after Mr. Rudman wrote to her to complain about its dissemination.</p>
        <p>Ms. Reno, in a letter to Mr. Rudman, said that the subject matter in the report was beyond the ''substantive expertise'' of the authors, that the report's characterizations were not adopted as government policy and that the document had never received proper vetting from government officials.</p>
        <p>In the lawsuit filed in Cleveland, lawyers for the bank and Mr. Jacobs allege that an official of the National Drug Intelligence Center gave a copy of the report to Mr. Schulz, who was then a professor at the United States Army War College in Carlisle, Pa., and that Mr. Schulz then leaked the document to reporters. The lawsuit also said that Mr. Schulz has denied to government investigators that he leaked the document. Telephone calls to Mr. Schulz's residence in Cleveland were not returned.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jacobs, in an interview, said he was upset by any allegations of wrongdoing. ''What I am outraged about is that I have always been an honest, law-abiding and compliant banker,'' he said. ''I believe my constitutional rights have been violated. They are doing it with reckless abandon and they should be held accountable for their actions.''</p>
