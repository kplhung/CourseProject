        <p>A cleaning woman who was upset about breaking up with her boyfriend made $6,131 worth of phone calls to psychic hot lines from an employer's home here, the police said. She got plenty of relationship advice, they said, but no warning that she would soon be behind bars.</p>
        <p>''That was the joke around here this week,'' said Detective Gerald Locascio of the Kent Police Department. ''We asked her if the psychics told her we'd catch her, and she said no, but that she had a feeling we would.''</p>
        <p>The woman, Patricia Ann Garofalo, 39, was charged today with two counts of fourth-degree grand larceny in the Town of Kent Justice Court. The police said she used her employer's telephone and credit card numbers to make the calls over the last several months. She is being held in the Putnam County jail in Carmel with bail set at $5,000.</p>
        <p>The employer, Margaret Hutcoe, 52, hired Ms. Garofalo last fall to clean her small two-story house in Carmel, the police said.</p>
        <p>Last month, MCI Worldcom cut off Mrs. Hutcoe's long-distance service, saying she owed about $1,000, mostly from calls made to psychic hot lines. ''I told them I live by myself and I've never called a psychic hot line, nor would I,'' she said today. ''It's just ridiculous. I have three big dogs, and I know they're not calling psychic hot lines.''</p>
        <p>Then she found that more than $4,700 worth of calls had been made over a two-month period on a second phone line that she had had installed in May for her computer but had not yet used. Apparently, Ms. Garofalo had plugged a phone into that line and had been intercepting the phone bill for it, the police said.</p>
        <p>The same day, Mrs. Hutcoe said, her stepmother called saying similar calls had been charged to her credit card number, which Mrs. Hutcoe had recently used and left scribbled on a notepad in the kitchen.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Hutcoe called detectives, who obtained phone and credit card records that showed calls being made from her home during Ms. Garofalo's regular cleaning visits, when Mrs. Hutcoe was at work. Ms. Garofalo was arrested last Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Detective Locascio said that Ms. Garofalo called many hot lines, including Eclipse Psychic, which offers insights from a clairvoyant for $4.59 per minute, and the Voice of Astrology, which offers personal astrology consultations by phone, costing $95 for 30 minutes, and weekly chart readings for $249 per month.</p>
        <p>He said Ms. Garofalo told him she started calling the hot lines after her boyfriend broke up with her.</p>
        <p>''You got to feel bad for her,'' he said. ''She was in rough shape and looking for some guidance. She had just gone through a breakup and was living with clients and friends, in her car and in a tent at the campgrounds. She needed a lot of advice.''</p>
        <p>The detective said he was still investigating whether Ms. Garofalo used other employers' telephones for the calls.</p>
        <p>Leland Prince, a spokeswoman for MCI Worldcom, said decisions about how customers settle fraudulent bills are determined only after investigations.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Hutcoe said she hired Ms. Garofalo last fall after calling a phone book listing for her business, Dust Bunnies. She had had difficulty finding a cleaning woman, Mrs. Hutcoe added. The few she had already interviewed declined after seeing her dogs, two boxers and a pit bull.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Garofalo agreed, and charged $40 per cleaning visit every two weeks. Mrs. Hutcoe said she never checked Ms. Garofalo's references before giving her a house key. They talked regularly, and when Ms. Garofalo was moving recently, Mrs. Hutcoe agreed to let her stay in a guest room for three days, she said, ''but then it became five, six days, and I told her 'That's it.' ''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Hutcoe said she learned an important lesson: ''There's definitely something to be said for cleaning one's own house.''</p>
