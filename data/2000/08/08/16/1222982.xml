        <p>The three-time Pro Bowl player shouted something at the undrafted, unknown rookie as the practice play ended.</p>
        <p>''What is wrong with you, boy,'' Michael Strahan, the Giants' star defensive end, said Monday at training camp. ''Get your hands off me.''</p>
        <p>Adam Young, a tight end from Dartmouth who a year ago was playing in something called the Regional Football League in Jackson, Miss., turned his head toward Strahan.</p>
        <p>In that moment, if it dawned on Young that Strahan would earn $8 million this season while Young may not make the team and could soon be back at his last job -- which was teaching physical education in an elementary school -- Young didn't show it.</p>
        <p>He put up his right hand and shoved hard at Strahan's shoulder.</p>
        <p>Strahan yapped at Young again, which should surely have sent Young scurrying back to the offensive huddle. Protocol matters in a National Football League camp and the rules for a rookie are clear: don't confront veterans, let alone prominent veterans. And definitely don't do it twice.</p>
        <p>But in this sequence Monday afternoon, Young raised his right hand and again shoved Strahan's shoulder pads.</p>
        <p>Then, Young turned and headed to the huddle. Given his status, Strahan did what most of his teammates would have expected. He charged Young, getting the 265-pound tight end in a headlock as he slammed him to the ground.</p>
        <p>There was little else to the tussle as Young and Strahan were soon separated. ''Two points, a clean takedown,'' Giants Coach Jim Fassel said later, joking about the confrontation in the classic boys-will-be-boys manner of football coaches.</p>
        <p>But today, when Fassel was asked about Young, it was clear that the coach had seen something he liked in a rookie who would stand up to a Pro Bowler. Besides, with tight ends Pete Mitchell and Dan Campbell out with injuries, Fassel needs Young, who is currently the Giants' second-string tight end.</p>
        <p>''Adam Young has gumption,'' Fassel said. ''He's a fighter. He's a little overloaded right now with all we've given him to learn and he lacks experience, but I like his competitiveness.''</p>
        <p>Young is a long shot to make the team, or at least to remain with the Giants the whole season. But with Campbell's hamstring strain lingering and Mitchell expected to miss another two or three weeks after knee surgery, Young could be the other tight end in uniform besides Howard Cross when the Giants open the regular season against Arizona Sept. 3.</p>
        <p>He caught two passes for 30 yards in the preseason loss to Jacksonville Friday, and he has been busy catching Kerry Collins's passes in practice this week in Mitchell's former role as the pass-catching tight end.</p>
        <p>''I want those guys to recover quickly, but there's no doubt I feel blessed and privileged to be getting so much playing and practice time,'' Young said.</p>
        <p>Only four months ago, Young was plotting a future without football. He was thinking he had given pro football a decent shot, but obviously it hadn't worked out.</p>
        <p>At Dartmouth, he had hardly played until his senior year, and he had drawn little attention from the N.F.L. It was much the same when he was coming out of high school in New Hampshire. Young, who is 6 feet 4 inches, had gone to Dartmouth for an education -- he majored in earth sciences -- and the school's football team was on the upswing.</p>
        <p>After graduation, he was persuaded to move to Mississippi to play in the fledgling Regional league, though Young said things didn't work out as expected.</p>
        <p>''They didn't draw many fans,'' said Young, who eventually took a job teaching. ''But I was sure I wanted to give football another shot.''</p>
        <p>But when he was sent home from the NFL Europe tryouts, Young was thinking it might be time to make a permanent career change. And then, on April 13, the Giants, who had scouted the NFL Europe camp, called.</p>
        <p>Several weeks and a few injured tight ends later, Young was playing with the Giants' first team and being thrown to the ground by a Pro Bowl player.</p>
        <p>''We just got a little excited,'' Young said today of the Strahan fracas, smiling impishly. ''It's no big deal. Everybody who's played football has got into a situation like that at one time or another.''</p>
        <p>His teammates knew how to react.</p>
        <p>When Young walked into the team dining hall Monday night -- with Strahan also in the room -- they started singing the theme from the movie ''Rocky.''</p>
        <p>''They were just teasing me,'' Young said. ''They do the same thing about playing at Dartmouth. Some of the guys from the bigger football schools say: 'Now who did you play?'</p>
        <p>''But I wouldn't trade my Dartmouth years for anything. It's natural to wonder what would have happened if I had gone to a bigger football school, but I've got no regrets.''</p>
        <p>And apparently, he wasn't intimidated in the first major confrontation of his first N.F.L. preseason camp.</p>
        <p>''No,'' Young said. ''I'm not intimidated. These guys are bigger, stronger and moving faster. But I'm out there too. And while I'm out there, I'm going to give them all the best I've got.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Running back SEAN BENNETT was examined by team doctors in Manhattan Tuesday for what Coach JIM FASSEL called a thigh bruise. Bennett also had an M.R.I. on his leg, and it seems likely he won't play against the Jets Friday. Bennett is another potential tight end candidate currently missing from the mix at that position.</p>
