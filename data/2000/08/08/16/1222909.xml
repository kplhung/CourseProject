        <p>Dr. Charles Brooke Flint Gibbs, a Rochester internist who was the last survivor of the founders of the American Diabetes Association 60 years ago, died on Aug. 4 in Rochester. He was 105.</p>
        <p>Dr. Gibbs was one of 32 founders of the association in 1940. Since then, it has grown to 280,000 members, with a staff of more than 800 and an annual budget of $88 million.</p>
        <p>Charles Gibbs, a native of Black River, near Watertown, N.Y., graduated from Syracuse University College of Medicine. He was its oldest living alumnus.</p>
        <p>His own care of diabetics left an imprint on a number of institutions. He was among the researchers at the University of Rochester who worked to isolate insulin in the 1920's. The university formed its medical school in 1925, and Dr. Gibbs organized the region's first diabetes clinic that year at Rochester General Hospital. He was named head of the first such clinic at Strong Memorial Hospital the next year.</p>
        <p>The medical school named the library of its endocrinology division in honor of Dr. Gibbs several years ago. He was a past president of the Rochester Academy of Medicine and founding president of the Rochester Regional Diabetes Association.</p>
        <p>Dr. Gibbs made house calls almost daily for 59 years, retiring from active practice in 1980. He died in his sleep at a nursing home.</p>
        <p>His wife, Blanche Haynes Gibbs, died in 1998 after 76 years of marriage.</p>
        <p>Dr. Gibbs is survived by two daughters, Molly Gibbs King of Syracuse and Nancy Zaenglein of Penfield, N.Y.; a son, Dr. Carl Gibbs of Santa Fe, N.M.; 12 grandchildren;  and 14 great-grandchildren.</p>
