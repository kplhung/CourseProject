        <p>Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo is back at the Joyce Theater, where it opened on Monday night in the first of two programs. That is the good news. The bad news is that the all-male ballet company, affectionately known as the Trocks, departs from the Joyce on Aug. 27.</p>
        <p>One of the happier conundrums of dance today is how the Trocks have come to such a perfect balance of tribute and sendup. The dancers have gotten very good technically. In ''Grand Pas Classique,'' for example, the ballerina Olga Supphozova knocks off a series of ornamented fouette turns that would be impressive for an actual female ballerina trained from childhood to dance on point. But the edge of witty teasing is never absent.</p>

        <p>Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo is back at the Joyce Theater, where it opened on Monday night in the first of two programs. That is the good news. The bad news is that the all-male ballet company, affectionately known as the Trocks, departs from the Joyce on Aug. 27.</p>
        <p>One of the happier conundrums of dance today is how the Trocks have come to such a perfect balance of tribute and sendup. The dancers have gotten very good technically. In ''Grand Pas Classique,'' for example, the ballerina Olga Supphozova knocks off a series of ornamented fouette turns that would be impressive for an actual female ballerina trained from childhood to dance on point. But the edge of witty teasing is never absent.</p>
        <p>It is no secret that the Trocks are just about the only classical company still dancing the beloved old Russian chestnuts that every balletomane grew up on. The opening program was exclusively Russian -- ballets that send one home humming the music -- with the exception of Peter Anastos's ''Go for Barocco,'' a savvy, affectionate parody of George Balanchine that was danced to nutty, body-tangling perfection by a cast led by that exotic old-world diva Iona Trailer and by Nadia Rombova, a long-stemmed prickly American rose of the sort that inspired Balanchine.</p>
        <p>For old and new balletomanes, an evening spent with the Trocks can be an exercise in heady, wistful nostalgia.</p>
        <p>The ballerinas may have big feet and hairy underarms, but they fill the stage with a theatrical perfume -- a sense of make-believe -- that is almost entirely lost in ''real'' ballet today. The Trocks are stars, creatures of another world in more than one way.</p>
        <p>The dancers no longer identify their actual names with their over-the-top stage names in the program. A few, particularly Mme. Supphozova, even lose themselves in their ballerina identity, recalling the strange beauty and poignancy of such original Trocks as the late, lamented Tamara Karpova and Ekaterina Sobechanskaya. And the Trocks take their ballet seriously enough to offer the audience an arcane but fascinating historical tidbit in their ''Raymonda's Wedding,'' new this season in a staging by Pamela Pribisco and Elena Kunikova.</p>
        <p>That artifact, taken from the libretto for the original 1898 production of ''Raymonda'' by Marius Petipa, is the mysterious White Lady, goofily performed by Aggripina Provoskovna, an Olympia Dukakis look-alike dressed in a costume that does wonderful things with a conelike headpiece and its flowing train. The costumes in general, designed by Mike Gonzales and Ken Busbin, are exquisite and telling. The perky, angling little single pink feathers sprouting from the corps men's caps say all that one needs to know about the Trocks and this production.</p>
        <p>One does not need to know or appreciate ballet history, however, to enjoy the Trocks. The performers' comic timing and controlled abandon are in themselves a show. Everyone will have his favorites. But keep an eye out for Maya Thickenthighya, a little darling whose maddened-flea attack is a highlight of ''Les Sylphides,'' in a fine cast completed by the Fracciesque Margeaux Mundeyn, her soulful partner Vladimir Legupski and Vanya Verikosa of the horsy grin. (How did ''Les Syphides'' ever come to seem so moribund in traditional productions?)</p>
        <p>Fifi Barkova, she of the tragic moue, and her partner, the artist formerly known as Prince Myshkin, form the perfect marriage from hell in the ''Don Quixote Pas de Deux.'' Igor Teupleze lives up to his name as Mme. Supphozova's hapless, childlike partner in ''Grand Pas Classique.''</p>
        <p>One could also not ask for a better cast in this ''Raymonda,'' whose dancers included the majestic Sveltlana Lofatkina in the title role, Mme. Thickenthighya as Magda, Mikolojus Vatisnyem as her hapless count and the solo dancers Sylphia Belchick, Mme. Rombova and Mme. Supphozova. The Trocks' ''Dying Swan'' still looks heavy-handed, however, despite the best efforts of the beaky, molting Ida Nevasayneva.</p>
