        <p>With a bear hug and a slight nudge, President Clinton pushed his understudy, Al Gore, to center stage today, relinquishing the limelight to the man he hopes will succeed him.</p>
        <p>It was a metaphoric ceremony that Vice President Gore has longed for as Mr. Clinton has effortlessly dominated news coverage and captured public attention -- and overshadowed Mr. Gore's efforts to  present himself as a leader in his own right.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton tried today to pass that torch to Mr. Gore here before a crowd of more than 15,000 people, the largest audience Mr. Gore has seen since he officially announced his candidacy more than a year ago.</p>
        <p>''The nominee of the Democratic Party,'' Mr. Clinton said, ''my partner and friend for the last eight years, understands where we are, where we're going and how it will affect ordinary citizens more than any other public figure in this country over the last 20 years.''</p>
        <p>Vouching for Mr. Gore, Mr. Clinton, who was operating on three hours of sleep after delivering his valedictory speech in Los Angeles on Monday, added: ''I hope you'll take my word for this, because I spent most of my adult life studying economics and the development of our country. The things that have happened in the last eight years -- the good things -- are nothing compared to the good things that can happen in the next eight years. Nothing!''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, who had been standing ramrod straight behind the president with Mrs. Clinton and Tipper Gore, Mr. Gore's wife, embraced Mr. Clinton and shed his jacket as he moved to the lectern.</p>
        <p>''I want to thank you, Mr. President, for giving me a chance to serve my country for the last eight years,'' Mr. Gore said, ''by working to help strengthen your hand.''</p>
        <p>He introduced his wife as ''the woman I love,'' and went on to tell the stories of several people whose lives had been improved by Clinton administration programs. He said that Mr. Clinton had built a strong foundation for the nation and that the  election was about whether voters wanted to build on that foundation or allow it to erode. Mr. Gore did not mention his Republican opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, but he did refer to the governor's proposal for an across-the-board tax cut of $1.3 trillion over 10 years. Mr. Gore has proposed tax cuts of about $500 billion.</p>
        <p>''You know, Bill Clinton worked hard to get this economy right,'' Mr. Gore said. ''And I'm pledging to you here today, I am not going to let the other side wreck it and take it away from us. We're going to keep the prosperity going.''</p>
        <p>It was not clear whether this ceremony would usher in for Mr. Gore a transfer of attention -- and an enhancement of his standing with the electorate -- or whether Mr. Clinton would continue to steal the show.</p>
        <p>As it was, Mr. Clinton upstaged Mr. Gore as soon as the symbolic ''passing of the torch'' was over . (No object was actually passed, as producers of television news programs had been led to believe might happen.) As Mr. Gore began speaking, eyes were diverted to Mr. Clinton who was draping his arms around Mrs. Clinton and Mrs. Gore.</p>
        <p>After they left, the Clintons  stopped at a McDonald's, an event that made a huge splash with local residents.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton marked the moment with a crispy chicken sandwich and fries. Whether he was anticipating one of the advantages of being an ordinary citizen or downing some comfort food to soothe his angst over the dimming of the limelight, he seemed cheerful enough.</p>
        <p>''If I'm going to be a citizen again, I'm going to have to start getting used to it,'' the president said as he shrugged and then slipped a $20 tip to the teenage waitresses, telling them to ''go out and have some fun.''</p>
        <p>Monroe, a town of 22,600 people near Lake Erie, was chosen because it represents the challenge ahead for Mr. Gore. It is a swing district that includes both rural and suburban voters, both high-tech and low-tech workers and an equal number of Democrats and Republicans.</p>
        <p>It is a bellwether area of the state, having voted for winners in most presidential elections in modern history. A survey from earlier this month, after Mr. Gore picked Senator Joseph I. Lieberman as his running mate, showed Governor Bush winning the support of 45 percent of those likely to vote and Mr. Gore 37 percent.</p>
        <p>''If Gore can win here, he can win the state'' and the national election, said Ed Sarpolus, a pollster in Lansing. ''This is one of Gore's toughest audiences. His problem is still Bill Clinton, the person.''</p>
