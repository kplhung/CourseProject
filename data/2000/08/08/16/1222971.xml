        <p>Government data released this evening showed that virtually all the recent deaths linked to Firestone tires now being recalled occurred when sport utility vehicles, most of them Ford Explorers, rolled over after the tires failed.</p>
        <p>Federal regulators said tonight that they had received more than 750 complaints about the failure of Firestone tires, involving 62 deaths. That is significantly more complaints and more deaths than previously announced, and more deaths than for any other safety recall involving autos or any kind of auto parts. The only recall of a comparable number of tires, another Firestone recall in 1978, followed far more complaints to regulators -- 14,000 -- but fewer deaths -- 41.</p>

        <p>Government data released this evening showed that virtually all the recent deaths linked to Firestone tires now being recalled occurred when sport utility vehicles, most of them Ford Explorers, rolled over after the tires failed.</p>
        <p>Federal regulators said tonight that they had received more than 750 complaints about the failure of Firestone tires, involving 62 deaths. That is significantly more complaints and more deaths than previously announced, and more deaths than for any other safety recall involving autos or any kind of auto parts. The only recall of a comparable number of tires, another Firestone recall in 1978, followed far more complaints to regulators -- 14,000 -- but fewer deaths -- 41.</p>
        <p>Why have the recent tire failures been unusually deadly? The tires recalled in 1978 were on cars; the tires at issue now are on sport utility vehicles and a few pickup trucks, which are harder to control when a tire fails.</p>
        <p>Safety groups and lawyers representing crash victims are urging automakers to make changes, like redesigning the tires and the suspensions, so that sport utilities will be less likely to go out of control and roll over when a tire fails. But automakers have mostly rejected these ideas as they try to satisfy customers.</p>
        <p>For example, putting nylon coatings inside would help hold the tires together when the tread peels off, as has happened with the Firestone tires. But that produces a bouncier ride, which few drivers choose at showrooms, so automakers seldom request the nylon from tire makers, said Brook Lindbert, the General Motors engineering director for tire and wheel systems.</p>
        <p>Recommending a high inflation pressure for tires, which the Ford Motor Company did not do for the Explorer, reduces the likelihood of a tire failure. But more fully inflated tires produce a bumpier ride, said Tom Baughman, Ford's engineering director for North American trucks. If the recommended pressure is fairly low to begin with, there is less of a safety margin to protect against leaks that may cause tire pressure to fall to dangerously low levels, he acknowledged.</p>
        <p>Most sport utility vehicles still use the stiff suspensions of the pickup trucks on which they were based. These shared suspensions hold down the cost and improve performance on rough terrain, a feature many drivers cherish even if they never leave the asphalt.</p>
        <p>Balancing these often conflicting demands is difficult. The question now in court cases and for regulators is whether too much safety has been compromised, and whether automakers have set a balance too far in the direction of customer desires and too little in the interest of safety.</p>
        <p>Led by Ford, which installed most of the recalled Firestone tires on its Ford Explorer vehicles, automakers say that they have set an appropriate balance between customer satisfaction and safety. Even with the deaths attributed to Firestone tires, Explorers have a 22 percent lower death rate in rollovers than competitors' midsize sport utilities and a 24 percent lower death rate in crashes over all, said Ernie Grush, Ford's manager of safety data analysis.</p>
        <p>While sport utility occupants have high death rates in rollovers, their overall death rates are no higher than for car occupants. This is because sport utilities fare well in collisions with lower-riding cars, he said, adding that, ''Customers should look at and consider the overall accident rate in all types of circumstances.''</p>
        <p>While the deaths now being attributed to tires might seem numerous to Explorer owners and are large for a recall of tires or auto parts, they represent a smaller problem by traffic safety standards.</p>
        <p>The tire-related deaths spread over the last several years are just a tiny part of the much bigger problem of rollovers, which kill 9,500 Americans a year. Rollovers, in turn, are just part of the overall problem of automobile crashes, which claim 41,000 lives annually.</p>
        <p>The high incidence of rollovers in the tire incidents could, however, focus attention on a move by Senate Republicans and the auto industry to block publication by the government of rollover ratings for cars and for light trucks, a category that includes minivans and pickup trucks as well as sport utilities.</p>
        <p>After 27 years of study and numerous objections by the auto industry, federal regulators announced plans on May 25 to begin the ratings this autumn. But after strenuous auto industry lobbying, the Senate inserted a little-noticed provision in the transportation budget this summer barring regulators from issuing the rules and ordering the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a one-year study of the regulators' technique for the ratings. The House version of the transportation budget does not contain this provision, and House and Senate conferees are scheduled to work out the differences in the budgets early next month.</p>
        <p>Michael Stanton, the senior lobbyist for the Washington-based Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, said the regulators' proposed rating system was too imprecise. The system compares a vehicle's width to the height of its center of gravity. The system does not take into account high-technology features like roof-mounted air bags, or the computerized vehicle stability systems that Ford plans to offer.</p>
        <p>But Ricardo Martinez, the administrator until last autumn of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which regulates vehicle safety, said that the rating system was reliable and should be adopted quickly. The system assigns vehicles one to five stars, like government crash test ratings.</p>
        <p>Sport utilities are more prone than cars to roll over if they lose a tire, although rollovers also depend on variables like driver skill, Mr. Lindbert of G.M. said. The higher a vehicle's center of gravity, the more the vehicle and its occupants tend to lean forward during braking, and this makes it important to retain as much traction as possible on the rear tires to keep the back end of the vehicle under control, he said.</p>
        <p>If a rear tire develops problems, Mr. Lindbert said, ''in many regards you have the potential to get sideways on the road,'' which tends to produce rollovers.</p>
        <p>Tonight's government data showed that while front and rear tires are subject to failure, rear tire failures caused all but 2 of the 131 rollovers reported to regulators. Not all rollovers resulted in death. Calculating the frequency of rollovers when tires fail is almost impossible because no one knows for sure how many tire failures there are. The government does not collect the data and tire makers do not share their data on their own brands.</p>
        <p>An analysis of federal data on deaths in tire-related accidents from 1990 to 1997, the most recent year available, shows that 91 percent of the deaths of occupants in Ford Explorers involved rollovers. Only 28 percent of the tire-related deaths in cars involved rollovers, said Leon Robertson, a retired Yale University epidemiologist who analyzed the data and who has also worked for plaintiff lawyers over the years.</p>
        <p>Tonight's government data included public complaints of 52 deaths in Explorers that rolled over after Firestone tires failed, and five more deaths in Explorers for which the complaints did not mention whether rollovers occurred. Only two Explorers did not roll over. The remaining deaths also involved rollovers, notably a Chevrolet Blazer and GMC Suburban. G.M., Nissan and Toyota use Firestone tire sizes that have not been recalled, and DaimlerChrysler does not use Firestone tires.</p>
        <p>Even before the Firestone tire problems, automakers had begun to make changes to their sport utilities. The next generation of Ford Explorers, which will go on sale in January, has a softer, car-like suspension of coiled springs instead of a truck suspension of steel bars that flex when the vehicle goes over bumps.</p>
        <p>With the new suspension will go new tires. Ford decided several years ago that the new Explorers would no longer use 15-inch tires but would have 16-inch tires instead. The 16-inch size has not been recalled -- although some plaintiff lawyers have called for this -- and is already used on the more expensive Explorers now. The tire has a recommended inflation pressure of 30 pounds per square inch, four pounds more than the 15-inch tires being recalled.</p>
        <p>Wes Sherwood, a Ford spokesman, said tonight that even before the current problems, Ford was considering a pressure of more than 30 pounds for the next generation of Explorers, particularly for the rear tires.</p>
        <p>But safety experts caution that the biggest safety gains will come not from tire changes but from motorists' buckling their seat belts. Government statisticians say that halving the frequency of unbuckled motorists, to one-sixth of front-seat occupants from one-third, would save several thousand lives each year.</p>
