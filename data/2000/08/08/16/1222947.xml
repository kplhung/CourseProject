        <p>Henry Silverman, the chief executive of the Cendant Corporation, made a bid yesterday to regain control of Avis Group Holdings, the nation's second-largest rental car company, at a price the market immediately deemed too low.</p>
        <p>The bid is his return to the acquisition trail after two years of accounting problems that grew out of his biggest merger, with CUC International.</p>
        <p>Mr. Silverman offered around $740 million, or $29 a share, a nearly 14 percent premium over Avis's previous-day closing price, but investors bid up the shares of Avis $5, to $30.50, its highest point in more than a year.</p>
        <p>Analysts said it was, in the words of Robert P. Napoli of ABN Amro, a ''ridiculously low'' bid for a leader in an extremely undervalued industry. Before the offer, Mr. Napoli said he expected Avis to be trading at $52 a share in 12 to 18 months; Henry A. Diamond of Credit Suisse First Boston had a target price of $43.</p>
        <p>''The whole sector is under appreciated,'' said David Riedel of Salomon Smith Barney. ''It's trading at 6.5 times next year's earnings compared with 28 times earnings for the S.&amp; P. index as a whole.''</p>
        <p>Avis would not discuss the proposal, but Greg Faulhaber, a spokesman for the Garden City, N.Y., company said the board would be meeting in the ''next day or so to consider it.''</p>
        <p>The proposed deal would bring back control over Avis to Mr. Silverman after a four-year hiatus. Through a predecessor of Cendant, HFS, he took over Avis in 1996, then spun it off as a separate company a year later. But Mr. Silverman's organization retained a stake of 18 percent and the Avis brand for which it receives 4 percent of the rental car company's annual revenue.</p>
        <p>Mr. Silverman's latest overture, Mr. Riedel said, could well serve as a catalyst for higher share prices for the whole car rental business.</p>
        <p>''This is a very misunderstood business,'' said Mr. Diamond of First Boston. ''The market thinks of it as highly cyclical like the airlines and lodging.''</p>
        <p>But analysts say Avis and the other big car rental companies like Hertz, the industry leader, National and the Dollar-Thrifty Group have developed considerable flexibility since the days when many of them were operated as subsidiaries of the big car manufacturers, which should help them through an economic downturn.</p>
        <p>Avis and the others, the analysts said, have deals that permit them to return cars to the manufacturers without penalty when business slows down and they have computer programs, similar to those used by the airlines, that enable them to shift cars and prices to different sites according to demand.</p>
        <p>Over the last three years, Mr. Riedel said annual revenue growth for the industry leaders has averaged 17 percent; net income has been growing at 40 percent and return on equity has jumped to 18 percent from 11 percent.</p>
        <p>''This is a very strong, profitable industry,'' Mr. Riedel said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Silverman has built an empire of well-known franchise companies like Howard Johnson and Century 21 real estate through a series of acquisitions. He joined his company, HFS Inc., with CUC International, an online telephone and shopping services company, to form Cendant in late 1997. A few months later, on April 15, 1998, Cendant announced the discovery of widespread accounting irregularities in CUC units.</p>
        <p>Since then, Cendant has agreed to a $2.8 million settlement with shareholders and three former CUC executives have pleaded guilty to inflating profits to keep share prices high.  Mr. Silverman suggested last month that the worst was past and that he was on the hunt for acquisitions to inject new vigor into Cendant. The Avis bid is his first move.</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 21, 2000, Monday  An article in Business Day on Wednesday about a bid for Avis Group Holdings by Henry Silverman, chief executive of the CendantCorporation, misstated the amount paid by Cendant in 1999 to settle accusations of accounting fraud. It was $2.8 billion, not $2.8 million.</p>
