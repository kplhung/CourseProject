        <p>Israel's main opposition party used a depleted special session of Parliament today to push through a resolution aimed at impeding new peace talks with the Palestinians, but Prime Minister Ehud Barak's government brushed the move aside as political grandstanding.</p>
        <p>Led by Ariel Sharon, the hawkish former general who leads the rightist Likud Party, opponents of the peace negotiations called Parliament into a special session that interrupted the summer recess.</p>
        <p>By a vote of 39 to 1, with only a third of the 120 members present, they approved another special session, tentatively set for Aug. 28, to debate a resolution that would declare any attempts by Mr. Barak to renew the peace talks without new elections illegal.</p>
        <p>The opposition move came during a flurry of new peace maneuvers aimed at bridging the deep differences on Jerusalem that caused negotiations for a final peace treaty at Camp David to collapse last month.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak, who did not attend the parliamentary session, spent part of his day meeting with top aides to discuss talks said to be set for Wednesday between high-ranking Israeli and Palestinian officials.</p>
        <p>An Israeli television report, not confirmed by the government, said the acting foreign minister, Shlomo Ben-Ami, was to meet with two top aides who had accompanied Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, to Camp David.</p>
        <p>The Palestinian officials were identified in the television report as Mohammed Dahlan and Ahmed Qurei, also known as Abu Ala. Mr. Qurei, the speaker of the Palestinian legislature, is regarded as one of the most powerful figures in the Palestine Liberation Organization.</p>
        <p>The talks would be the highest-level contacts the two sides have acknowledged holding since Camp David and seemed likely to focus on Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>Since Camp David, both sides have marked out seemingly irreconcilable positions on the city, with Mr. Arafat demanding that Israel hand over sovereignty over all of East Jerusalem and Mr. Barak and his aides vowing that Israel will go no further than the compromises suggested by President Clinton and tentatively accepted by Mr. Barak at Camp David.</p>
        <p>As outlined by Israeli and Palestinian officials, those compromises would involve a limited Palestinian foothold at the Muslim holy sites in the Old City as well as control of the old Arab quarter and some Arab villages on the city's eastern periphery.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak was also said to have agreed that Mr. Arafat could establish a presidential headquarters for a Palestinian state in East Jerusalem, allowing the Palestinians to declare it their capital.</p>
        <p>At today's parliamentary session, Mr. Sharon sought to stir a public groundswell against Mr. Barak with a highly charged speech that depicted Mr. Barak as a usurper ready to trade Israel's control of Jerusalem for a peace agreement.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sharon contended that Mr. Barak, who lost his parliamentary majority when three parties quit his coalition government immediately before the Camp David talks, had no mandate to govern or to negotiate peace with the Palestinians.</p>
        <p>''Barak does not have the right to give up Jerusalem, which the people received as a legacy,'' Mr. Sharon said.</p>
        <p>Aides to Mr. Barak dismissed the parliamentary vote as largely irrelevant to the peace efforts, saying that Mr. Barak, elected prime minister by a wide margin in the popular vote 15 months ago, had a constitutional and political mandate to continue peace negotiations unless ousted in a new election.</p>
        <p>Besides, they said, Mr. Sharon and his parliamentary allies failed to force early elections only two weeks ago, when a no-confidence motion against Mr. Barak's government fell 3 votes short of the 61 votes needed.</p>
        <p>That vote was followed by another on Aug. 2 in which opposition parties succeeded in mustering 61 votes in favor of dissolving Parliament, which would lead to new elections. But Israel's basic law requires such a vote to be approved afterward by a parliamentary committee, then again by the full Parliament, before becoming law -- a process not likely to be completed, if at all, until Parliament ends its summer recess and resumes on Oct. 29.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Sharon and his aides have been working to win over some members who voted against the no-confidence motion, with a view to trying to topple Mr. Barak during the recess, most Israeli politicians predict that the prime minister will survive at least until the fall session.</p>
        <p>Even if he is defeated then, either in a no-confidence vote or by passage of a law mandating new elections, Mr. Barak will have 90 days before an election to seek a peace accord.</p>
        <p>Israeli political commentators said Mr. Sharon, lacking the numbers for a no-confidence vote, appeared to have settled for the time being on a course intended to undermine public confidence in Mr. Barak.</p>
        <p>In that context, they said, the parliamentary debate later this month seems likely to be largely a forum for more impassioned denunciations of Mr. Barak. All the same, these commentators said, the parliamentary drumbeat against the peace talks is not likely to encourage progress in the negotiations.</p>
