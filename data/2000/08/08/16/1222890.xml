        <p>The Salzburg Festival has long adhered to the historic idea of an arts festival as a place apart from the workaday music world. Here artists collaborate in near-ideal conditions, freed to an amazing degree from the scheduling and budget constraints that during most regular seasons necessitate cutting corners and adjusting expectations.</p>
        <p>Of course, one of the conditions affecting this summer's festival is the political and cultural upheaval caused by the ascension of the right-wing, vociferously nationalistic Freedom Party, now part of Austria's governing coalition. Gerard Mortier, who in eight years as the festival's innovative artistic director turned this former bastion of traditionalism into a hotbed of experimentation, has been appalled by the developments. For next summer, his last, he promises to make the festival a virtual celebration of multiculturalism.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, true to form, this summer's offerings, especially the opera productions, have been stirring debate. One is a fascinating new staging of Gluck's ''Iphigenie en Tauride,'' heard on Saturday night at the Residenzhof, a setting like no other.</p>
        <p>Every summer the festival's wizards of theater technology turn the enormous open courtyard of this grand palace, once the residence of Salzburg's ruling archbishops, into a makeshift opera house with seating for 780. The stage and seats are placed atop a steel-framed structure, like some huge Erector set, with a canvas roof. Only here would patrons dressed in evening finery climb into what is essentially the world's most lavish metal bleachers to attend cutting-edge opera productions. It was an inspired site for the German director Claus Guth's daring production of Gluck's great opera epitomizing the classical ideal.</p>
        <p>Typically, it's difficult for a production to convey the essential prehistory of this mythological story. To assure success in his war against Troy, Agamemnon, the Greek king, has sacrificed his daughter, Iphigenie. But the goddess Diana has rescued her and brought her to Tauris, where she lives under the rule of Thoas, the Scythian king, and serves as a high priestess to Diana.</p>
        <p>Iphigenie's mother, Clytemnestra, has killed her husband in grief over what she believes to be her daughter's death. And Oreste, Iphigenie's younger brother, has killed his mother to avenge his father.</p>
        <p>Mr. Guth conveys this horrific background story through enormous masks that enclose the heads of a group of actors. Like eerie oversize puppets, the actors appear at strategic moments as doubles for the members of antiquity's most murderous dysfunctional family. The puppet-actors trail the singers onstage like doppelgangers who won't go away.</p>
        <p>It's an overtly dramatic and, no doubt for some, a heavy-handed theatrical device. Masks of any kind can dominate a production. But the three leading singers here, all Americans, hold their own: the mezzo-soprano Susan Graham in a fearless performance of the title role, the baritone Thomas Hampson in a riveting performance as Oreste, and the tenor Paul Groves as Oreste's loving Greek friend Pylade.</p>
        <p>The look of the production, with sets and costumes by Christian Schmidt, is vaguely Victorian. The story takes place in a plush salon with huge tilted walls covered in crimson velvet. Yet the effect is timeless. The chorus of priestesses who serve Iphigenie wear flesh-colored masks over their eyes and auburn wigs pulled back in buns, so that they look eerily like their mistress. On their dresses, they even have bloody stains above their hearts, as she does, wounds of sisterly solidarity. Mr. Guth devised highly stylized but compelling and lifelike movements for the priestesses and for the male chorus of Thoas's soldiers.</p>
        <p>The musical performance, with Ivor Bolton conducting the Mozarteum Orchestra of Salzburg, was inspired. The role of Iphigenie is typically sung by a soprano, but Ms. Graham subtly altered the rich mezzo-soprano colorings of her voice, bringing lightness and clarity to her top range, yet singing with emotional abandon. Mr. Hampson's singing was also viscerally intense, yet poignant and elegant. Mr. Groves pushed his light tenor voice somewhat but still delivered a vulnerable and impressive performance. The baritone Philippe Rouillon was a menacing King Thoas.</p>
        <p>Clearly the festival gave the creative team free rein. Of course, having to work within limits can often compel artists to clarify their ideas. In two current stagings of Mozart operas the directors were allowed, it would seem, to indulge themselves. Together these productions suggest that in Mozart's hometown, directors are straining to keep his canonical works interesting, even if gimmickry is the result.</p>
        <p>The director Luca Ronconi's production of ''Don Giovanni,'' heard on Sunday night at the Large Festival Hall, was generally deemed a failure when introduced last year. It's a cumbersome staging with a muddled conception vaguely suggesting 1930's Fascist Italy, with the Don as a dissolute millionaire playboy who seems to have a thing for leather outfits when he attempts rape. There is a grimly serious side to ''Don Giovanni,'' but in this production, with Margherita Palli's charcoal gray and monumentally ugly set, the opera just seems depressing.</p>
        <p>This was sad, for the musical performance was marvelous. Valery Gergiev conducted the Vienna Philharmonic with a keen ear for fresh detail, a vivid sense of drama and some boldly magisterial tempos. In the title role, the resonant bass Ferruccio Furlanetto led a strong cast that included the powerful bass Rene Pape as, surprisingly, a vocally agile Leporello; the exquisite soprano Renee Fleming as a Donna Anna to cherish; and the luminous-voiced soprano Marina Mescheriakova as Donna Elvira.</p>
        <p>Monday night at the Small Festival Hall offered the controversial new production of ''Cosi fan tutte'' by the director Hans Neuenfels, with sets and costumes by Reinhard von der Thannen. The staging is over the top and a mishmash of ideas, but at times intriguing.</p>
        <p>The two pairs of confused and inconstant lovers at the center of this cynical comedy wear matching white jumpsuits, a device that makes the partner-swapping and games of deception all the more unsettling. There are unforgettable images, as in the garden scene, in which the deceiving lovers court one another amid wildly overgrown exotic flowers.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Neuenfels must not trust the opera, for he cannot leave the music alone. Too many arias and ensembles are performed before self-consciously symbolic and often pointless background action from a roster of invented silent characters.</p>
        <p>The worst such intrusion involves a video projected on a large screen during the scene in which the audience first meets the two sisters of the story as they sing in blissful innocence about their boyfriends. On screen a gorgeous young couple enact a modern-day version of the Adam-and-Eve tale, complete with an apple riddled with worms. Standing arm in arm before the screen, the radiant soprano Karita Mattila as Fiordiligi and the dusky-toned mezzo-soprano Vesselina Kasarova sang the duet incomparably. But it was hard not to fixate on this weird movie.</p>
        <p>The entire cast was excellent: the lyric tenor Rainer Trost as Ferrando, the robust baritone Simon Keenlyside as Guglielmo, the stentorian bass Franz Hawlata as Don Alfonso, and the bright-voiced soprano Maria Bayo as Despina. The conductor Lothar Zagrosek's gesticulating baton technique did not elicit the most consistently incisive playing from the Vienna Philharmonic, but the sound, shape and character of the music-making were wondrous.</p>
        <p>The singers were not just vocally strong, but attractive, charismatic and good sports. Would that Mr. Neuenfels had simplified his conception and removed the extraneous clutter, which must have been terribly expensive. What he needed was something not known at the Salzburg Festival, a tough-guy boss, like Joseph Volpe at the Metropolitan Opera, to tell him no once in a while.</p>
