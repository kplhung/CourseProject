        <p>Renting in Crete</p>
        <p>Q. Next spring my family and I would like to rent a house on Crete, but I am having difficulty finding information. Do you have any  suggestions? -- Anne Zachos, Manchester, N.H.</p>
        <p>A. Spring is usually a wonderful time to visit Crete, with fewer crowds and typically glorious weather. You should have no problem finding accommodations, with prices often 20 to 40 percent lower than in high season, according to one agent who rents houses there.</p>

        <p>Renting in Crete</p>
        <p>Q. Next spring my family and I would like to rent a house on Crete, but I am having difficulty finding information. Do you have any  suggestions? -- Anne Zachos, Manchester, N.H.</p>
        <p>A. Spring is usually a wonderful time to visit Crete, with fewer crowds and typically glorious weather. You should have no problem finding accommodations, with prices often 20 to 40 percent lower than in high season, according to one agent who rents houses there.</p>
        <p>David Kendall, director of Villas International in San Rafael, Calif., in business for 21 years, says his company works with three or four local agents on Crete and concentrates on two main areas of the island: Canea, also known as Chania or Hania, at the foot of the White Mountains west of Iraklion, the capital, and Agios Nikolaos, to the east. Accommodations include everything from simple studios to five-  or six-bedroom villas, a few on the water, some with private pools.</p>
        <p>In Canea, a good base for hiking into the Samaria Gorge or relaxing on the sandy beaches stretching to the west, and in the seaside town of Rethimno, 20 miles to the east, two-bedroom houses cost $1,000 to $1,250 a week (prices quoted are rates for next spring). At the high end, and near the resort of Agios Nikolaos at the other end of the island, a three-bedroom house on a cliff overlooking Mirabello Bay with a private cove starts at $3,500 a week, depending on the number of occupants.</p>
        <p>Villas International also has a few properties on the southern and eastern coasts of the island, where there are secluded beaches and small fishing villages. Generally, a minimum  stay of seven days is required.</p>
        <p>For information, contact Villas International, 950 Northgate Drive, Suite 206, San Rafael, Calif. 94903; (800) 221-2260, fax (415) 499-9491; www.villasintl.com; e-mail info@ villasintl.com.</p>
        <p>Another company offering a few rentals (it has more houses for sale) goes by its Web site name, www .a-house-on-crete.com; telephone and fax (30-831) 72668. A new two-bedroom house in Roumeli, near Rethimno, with a pool and garden, a mile from the beach, costs $500 a week (April through October). A 250-year-old restored villa in Hamalevri, a tiny village seven miles east of Rethimno, with three large bedrooms, two baths, a garden and sea and mountain views, costs $800 a week. There is a 10 percent discount for stays of more than two weeks.  Mark Last, the owner, says more houses will be available for rent by next spring.</p>
        <p>The Greek National Tourist Organization in New York suggests you look at the listings of houses, villas and apartments on the Web site of Crete Tournet, at www.crete .tournet.gr. The site includes address, telephone and fax for each property, with descriptions of accommodations and facilities, color photographs, location (distance from the beach and from the nearest town) and last renovation.</p>
        <p>Touring the Baltics</p>
        <p>Q. I am interested in touring the Baltic States (Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia) and parts of Russia next May or June. Are there any tour agencies that arrange these trips? -- L. B., Glen Head, N.Y.</p>
        <p>A. Next year will be a particularly good time to visit the Baltics, as Latvia is celebrating its 800th anniversary. There will be a wide range of competitions, festivals, exhibitions and special events in Riga and  around the country.</p>
        <p>One agency handling Baltic tours, in business for 70 years, is Uniontours, 245 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10016, (212) 683-9500 or (800) 451-9511; www.uniontours.com; e-mail travel@uniontours.com. Exact itineraries and dates have not been set for next spring but should be similar to this year's. Prices would be somewhat higher, said Stephanie Horton, the president, because accommodations will be in Radisson hotels in Vilnius, Riga and Tallinn.</p>
        <p>An eight-night tour of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia that costs around $1,695 this year would include air fare between New York and Vilnius, Lithuania ($599 land only). Two days are spent in Vilnius touring the modern and medieval city, followed by an afternoon exploring the resort town of Trakai, with an excursion to a 14th-century island castle, now an art museum. In Riga, Latvia, visitors are taken to see the magnificent 18th-century Rundale Palace, the Old Town and its churches and cafes and the Art Nouveau district. (If you go in mid-June you will be in time for Riga's Opera Festival, June 8 to 21.)</p>
        <p>In Sigulda, known as the Latvian Switzerland, visitors explore a 13th-century castle and a cave covered by inscriptions dating from the 17th century. The trip includes a drive along the Baltic coast to the Estonian resort town of Parnu, and then on to Tallinn, with its old fortification walls, cobblestone streets and massive 14th-century town hall. The company also offers tours of Moscow and St. Petersburg.</p>
        <p>Another company specializing in the Baltics is Baltic Design Tours,  5650 Yonge Street, North York, Ontario Canada M2M 4G3; (888) 226-3628 or (416) 221-9212, fax (416) 221-6789; www.baltic-design-tours.on.ca.</p>
        <p>Its seven-day Baltic Panorama tour begins and ends in Helsinki and includes Tallinn, Vilnius and Trakai, the former capital Kaunas and its Old Town, Riga and the university town of Tartu; this year the cost is $1,100. (Prices and itineraries are not yet set for next year.) The eight-day Baltic Highlights tour includes two days in St. Petersburg with a visit to the Hermitage ($900 this year). Prices do not include air fare.</p>
        <p>Trains in Tuscany</p>
        <p>Q. I want to use the train as my mode of transportation for a vacation in Tuscany from Sept. 21 to Oct. 12. Do you know how I can buy tickets for travel to several cities (Florence to Siena to Pisa to Lucca to Florence) before I depart the United States? -- L. P., Portland, Ore.</p>
        <p>A. You can buy train tickets through C.I.T. Rail, a division of C.I.T. Tours, at (800) 248-7245. The company will send the tickets by standard two-day Federal Express. Schedules and prices can be found at the company's Web site, cit-tours .com. The cost of the two-hour trip from Florence to Siena is $20 first class, $14 second class; the two-hour trip from Siena to Pisa, with a change at Empoli, is $23 and $16; the half-hour trip between Pisa and Lucca, $12 and $9; and the hour-and-a-half leg from Lucca to Florence, $18 to $12. Trains between each city run frequently, with between 17 and 25 a day.</p>
