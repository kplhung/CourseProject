        <p>What most young women are left with after seeing ''Breakfast at Tiffany's'' is a desire to live in Manhattan and be madcap. It is difficult to say precisely what constitutes a madcap life, except that, as the judge said of pornography, we know it when we see it.</p>
        <p>It is almost easier to say what isn't madcap. For instance, men are not madcap. Married people are not madcap. Women in their 30's are not madcap; Sarah Jessica Parker and her cohorts on ''Sex and the City'' act wild and crazy, they have a rash of good times, but there is something of the infinite sense of promise that is gone.

        <p>What most young women are left with after seeing ''Breakfast at Tiffany's'' is a desire to live in Manhattan and be madcap. It is difficult to say precisely what constitutes a madcap life, except that, as the judge said of pornography, we know it when we see it.</p>
        <p>It is almost easier to say what isn't madcap. For instance, men are not madcap. Married people are not madcap. Women in their 30's are not madcap; Sarah Jessica Parker and her cohorts on ''Sex and the City'' act wild and crazy, they have a rash of good times, but there is something of the infinite sense of promise that is gone. They know the deal. They have seen the end of the affair. They have slipped irrevocably from the insouciance of a Holly Golightly toward the wryness of a Dorothy Parker.</p>
        <p>I argue that the rich cannot be madcap. If you have money, you can affect a madcap existence -- running for taxis in your Blahniks, kissing zillionaires -- but these acts are somehow mitigated by the fact that the cabs are not an indulgence but a necessity, that the zillionaires are your rightful dates and that you never, ever contemplated jerry-rigging a dress from a pair of drapes.</p>
        <p>It helps, too, to come from outside New York -- far outside. That way, a metropolitan sophistication has just dawned on you, and sparkling things, like gold lame and the top of the Chrysler Building, are relatively new.</p>
        <p>But let us say you meet all of the qualifications -- single, female, in your 20's, poor -- as so many of us in Manhattan do. Still, renting ''Breakfast at Tiffany's'' for a second or third go-round, you notice that something is lacking. That something is the icing on the cake. Or, to put it another way, you have the accouterments but not the clothes. In the movie of your life, it will never say, ''Costumes by Hubert de Givenchy.'' The great houses do not come begging to dress you; de la Renta does not send over gowns inspired by you. Instead you scrimp for the Bendel sale, making do with vintage coats and retro trends that put your mother's fur pieces back into circulation.</p>
        <p>Such was my situation when Albert Sakhai came into my life.</p>
        <p>When I met Albert, I was living in a 200-square-foot walk-up in Chelsea. By night I baby-sat for a movie star's teenage son; the rest of the time I tried to write. The setup of the apartment necessitated lots of Sally Bowles-ish lounging in bed, often during the day, for I was a raging insomniac and in that apartment had met my Waterloo. What it lacked in space, it made up for in noise: I lived above the Chelsea Fire Station, Engine 3, Ladder 12.</p>
        <p>Freddy the Fireman might have remained my only friend on the block if I hadn't finally worked up the nerve to enter the atelier of Albert Sakhai, which stood next door to the fire station. I glanced into Albert's shop every time I walked by it; the couture gowns in the window stood out on that otherwise drab block like jewels on a crone's neck. But I was sure I couldn't afford the micro-est mini, and, more than that, I suspected that the scene inside would be much too cool for a new arrival. It was several months before I braved the door.</p>
        <p>It was about this time that friends of mine (who had chosen professions more lucrative than baby-sitting) started inviting me to benefits for the Philharmonic, the Museum of the City of New York and so forth. Occasionally, I would have a date for one of them, or sometimes I would go with the group. The benefits often had themes like ''The Arabian Nights,'' ''Flying Down to Rio'' and ''Plymouth on the Rocks,'' and I would always find myself crashing into Daffy's about half an hour before I was due uptown, or sitting down with scissors in hand to doctor up an eighth-grade Laura Ashley. Then it was the mad dash to the old Barneys to beg the guy at the Chanel counter to do my makeup, shove in some bobby pins and sprint over to Sixth Avenue for a budget-busting cab uptown.</p>
        <p>After a few of these affairs, I had worked my way through my closet -- Grandmother's 1920's Chinese pajamas, Sister's Betsey Johnson from the 1986 Gold and Silver Ball -- and Daffy's was starting to disappoint. So one afternoon I went -- desperate and impulsive -- into Albert Sakhai's shop.</p>
        <p>It was hard to tell at first who was Albert Sakhai. A number of people were hanging out inside -- a languid brunette munching chips, a couple of young men who turned out to be clerks from the gay and lesbian bookstore across the street and, in a Village People-ish twist, an actual uniformed fireman from the station next door. Everyone stopped talking and looked at me when I came in, and I probably would have turned and run, except that at that moment, a man of about 35 in a do-rag stood up from the sewing machine in back and said, in an accent I couldn't identify but somehow found both chic and comforting: ''Yes, hello. I am Albert Sakhai. How can I help you?''</p>
        <p>This time the affair was ''Cabana Night,'' and, feeling a bit ridiculous, I managed to stammer out my need for a costume and a vague description of what I had in mind. The thing with Albert, which I later came to appreciate, is that he's one of those people who actually listen to you, so you end up chattering on and on, expecting him to interrupt you, as anyone else would. When I had finished my awkward little speech, the brunette and the clerks and the fireman resumed their lolling about, and Albert went and dug around in the back. So as not to have to make conversation, I looked over his stuff. There were men's vests made of shearling, little fleece hats, a taffeta ball gown embroidered with aquamarines. Albert came back with some vintage floral-print silk palazzo pants. ''Take these and I'll make you something for the top,'' he said. He then told me to go to Loehmann's and buy yellow sandals. I paid him for the pants, which I loved, muttered something about not wanting anything too wild, and left.</p>
        <p>Upstairs in my apartment it occurred to me that he had not taken my measurements for the top he was going to make and that the whole encounter had not been very official. We hadn't talked money, for instance.</p>
        <p>I waited a day or two and decided to go back and set this guy straight -- tell him he had better get going, the party was a night away. When I came in, Albert, alone now, looked up from wrapping a mannequin in some spongy material: ''Yes, hello, how are you?''</p>
        <p>''Well, I . . .''</p>
        <p>''It's on the rack there,'' he said, and pointed. ''It'' was a chartreuse sleeveless raw silk wrap-top. For the first time I experienced what would become customary: I hadn't even known what I wanted until Albert had created it.</p>
        <p>''But you never took my measurements,'' I wondered aloud.</p>
        <p>Albert laughed at this. ''You think I need measurements?'' He came out to help me try the top on. I went behind the curtains of his dressing stage -- an elevated platform in front of a mirror swathed in bright pink and gold fabrics.</p>
        <p>''What I would wear underneath it?'' I called from behind the curtain.</p>
        <p>''Nothing!'' he answered. I poked my head out. ''You're not one of those bra girls, are you?'' he asked. I said I guessed I wasn't. I tried on the top. It was unbelievably perfect. The one garment evoked the Mediterranean Sea, oversize sun hats and Sophia Loren in ''Houseboat.'' When I came out, Albert fixed the twist tie so it sat properly, above the belly button.</p>
        <p>''Did you buy the yellow shoes?''</p>
        <p>I lied and said I had, making a note to do so immediately.</p>
        <p>''O.K., so you're set.''</p>
        <p>Now came the part that made me red in the face: ''Er, how much -- ?''</p>
        <p>''How much do you have?'' Albert interrupted, clearly on to what was coming.</p>
        <p>''Well . . .'' I stalled. ''Negative 535'' didn't strike me as the best answer.</p>
        <p>''Fifty is good,'' Albert volunteered. Hugely relieved, I forked over the bills and went skipping up to my apartment to try the whole thing on. I had my cabana outfit, and my outfit was a hit.</p>
        <p>At the time I vowed that if I ever went back to Albert, I would do it right. I would go in plenty of time, with plenty of money -- and I wouldn't shy away from discussing price. But like many initial encounters, ours had established a pattern: I would run in at the last minute in need of a shirt, a skirt, a dress that I had to have but knew I couldn't afford.</p>
        <p>''Can you whip something up?'' I'd beg. Soon, when I appeared in the door, Albert would simply say, already picking up his scissors to start cutting, ''I can whip, I can whip.'' Then I would have a different vision from Albert's for an outfit, and he'd have to bring me around to his way of thinking.</p>
        <p>''Black jersey?'' I'd say, dubiously.</p>
        <p>''People are coming from Europe for this! They buy all they can! You can't get it there! Trust me!''</p>
        <p>I'd be skeptical and then, when the thing was made, humbled, repentant and wildly grateful. Each time -- in the black sheath, in the floor-length blue satin, in the Versace-esque mermaid gown -- was a sartorial revelation. Meanwhile, the conversations about money never got easier. In fact, they got more and more awkward, as details about Albert's real business slipped out: custom-made wedding dresses for thousands of dollars that were shipped to South America, clients who came in and bought their whole look, head to toe, from Albert.</p>
        <p>''What would you pay for this at Bergdorf's?'' he would start.</p>
        <p>''But I couldn't find it at Bergdorf's.''</p>
        <p>''So what's good for you? Tell me. I won't be insulted.''</p>
        <p>''No, no -- you tell me and I'll see if I can afford it.''</p>
        <p>''Look, you're a friend of mine. I'd rather you wear it than someone I don't know.''</p>
        <p>''Are you sure you're not just saying that?''</p>
        <p>We'd stumble through to a number, and I'd write a hasty check and flee with the garment, feeling as if I'd stolen it.</p>
        <p>For two years I went to Albert. I went to him for originals and for ''Albertizations'' -- off-the-rack purchases that he would transform into fabulous originals. I went for advice (''This is cute. This material is cute. But you see these straps? These straps are why this isn't cute'') and speculation (If someday I ever had money, what would he make me?). I went sheepishly to ask for alterations, and sometimes I got alterations without asking.</p>
        <p>''Give me that coat; your buttons are falling off -- here, hand it over. I'll fix it for you. You want to look shabby?''</p>
        <p>He got to know me -- You always want the best and you always have no money!'' And I got to know him: his philosophy (why give a gift if it doesn't make you happy?). A little bit of his background (Iranian); his pet peeve (women who wanted to look like Kate Moss).</p>
        <p>Sometimes I would just stop by to say hello after running out for a break from the word processor.</p>
        <p>''Why do you always buy one little soda can? You should buy a pack. Then you would have some.''</p>
        <p>I didn't tell him that if I had some I wouldn't have an excuse to take a break.</p>
        <p>Albert believed in treating yourself well, in enjoying life, in a generosity toward the self. My life was run on the principle of all or nothing: sell the novel or live in squalor; find a man to marry or live the nonstop, frenetic single life; have the best dress at the party or don't go at all.</p>
        <p>A few winters ago, in a vertiginous instance of life imitating art, Albert made me a costume for a ''Breakfast at Tiffany's'' party thrown at a midtown concert hall. The costume evoked rather than copied Holly's look: it was a simple black sheath and black gloves with a two-foot feathered hat that won a prize. I was too vain to wear my glasses (they didn't work with the hat) and I ended up dancing most of the night with a Southern stranger who was the best dancer I have ever met and who managed to heed my warnings of ''Watch the hat!'' while putting Fred Astaire in ''Holiday Inn'' to shame. (All I remember about the guy is that he wasn't particularly tall and that he said he was working on the Jeb Bush campaign.) I went home alone, but at least I was warm: Albert had lent me one of his embroidered wool shawls -- a garment to make you feel like a queen, if ever there was one.</p>
        <p>And then one day Albert defined my style. Handing over a black ribbed taffeta shirt with a gold lame waist, he snatched my glasses, put them on and announced, ''Here I am, I'm Caitlin and I'm geeky-sexy.''</p>
        <p>''Geeky-sexy'' made sense to me, and not just because of my tortoise-shell frames; the truth was that, unlike Holly, but like many female writers, I wanted to be muse and writer both: Audrey Hepburn and George Peppard, Holly Golightly and Capote, too.</p>
        <p>After two years of insomnia and poverty in Chelsea, it was time I turned my life around. In the summer of '98 I moved to Brooklyn. I got a day job at a midtown consulting firm. Then, last May, I finished my novel, and it sold. Several months went by. I didn't buy anything major, like a car or an antique, but I did indulge my wardrobe. I went to London and hit the sales. I bought some Gucci loafers, and I went to see Albert, finally, to tell him about the book and to ask him to make me a dress, now that I had money.</p>
        <p>''You came back,'' he said.</p>
        <p>For the dress he described his vision, and we did our usual back-and-forth about the price -- much more than I had paid in the past, much less than I should have, and he would throw in a jacket to match. This time, though, I was a real client. I signed a contract, on which he had sketched the dress; I paid some money up front (though it was just the cash I had on me); and I showed up for two scheduled fittings. I had no special occasion for the dress in mind; I was just buying it because I wanted another Albert Sakhai in my closet.</p>
        <p>Wandering from the subway through my old neighborhood, I inevitably thought about how much things had changed for me since I had lived there. For one thing, I drink a lot less. Somewhere along the line I lost seven pounds. I have a savings account now, and a boyfriend. Even my fitness program has calmed down: when I lived in Chelsea, I would go to packed, screaming disco-fitness classes taught at the Y.M.C.A.</p>
        <p>Now I'm into yoga. This month I turn 30, and I'm beginning to contemplate the idea of trading in some of the highs and lows of life for something more sustaining. The dress Albert made me is black, one-shoulder and trails the floor. My boyfriend got tickets to a museum party a few weeks ago, and so I wore the dress with the matching three-quarter-length jacket.</p>
        <p>The dress is a classic, the kind of thing you could wear forever. ''No more winky-dinky,'' Albert warned me of my old habit of begging random scraps of material off of him to wear as wraps and bandeaux. ''Your life is different now.''</p>
        <p>But Albert knows how I like to mix it up -- wear a thing 10 different ways and turn a style on its head. So he made me a tunic that goes over the dress and changes the look entirely.</p>
        <p>It's black, too, but it doesn't have a serious bone in its body. For in spite of a certain stability -- and the fact that I can afford cabs -- my off-road adventures aren't entirely over. In a dress by Albert Sakhai, I always see a world of possibilities.</p>
