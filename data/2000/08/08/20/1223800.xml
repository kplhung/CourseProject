        <p>The unions that represent actors in television commercials are on strike. I work at a recording studio, not party to the strike, that has been hired for sessions using nonunion actors. This makes me squeamish, to say the least. I have friends on both sides of the conflict, including many producers from small ad agencies. I could refuse to participate in nonunion sessions, thus alienating my boss. I could call the union and it would picket my studio, but that could imperil the livelihood of my boss and my producer friends. Or I could do nothing. What do you suggest? -- Brian Hallas, Brooklyn</p>
        <p>Considering your convictions, you would do better to join an effort against nonunion actors at all independent recording studios, not just your own. That's the call you should make to the union -- to ask how you can participate. That beats the alternatives you have suggested. Eschewing nonunion sessions would jeopardize your job but benefit no one; you would be replaced, and the sessions would continue. Passivity is no better: it would allow the strike to go on and on, something deleterious to the union actors, the small producers, your employer and your conscience.</p>

        <p>The unions that represent actors in television commercials are on strike. I work at a recording studio, not party to the strike, that has been hired for sessions using nonunion actors. This makes me squeamish, to say the least. I have friends on both sides of the conflict, including many producers from small ad agencies. I could refuse to participate in nonunion sessions, thus alienating my boss. I could call the union and it would picket my studio, but that could imperil the livelihood of my boss and my producer friends. Or I could do nothing. What do you suggest? -- Brian Hallas, Brooklyn</p>
        <p>Considering your convictions, you would do better to join an effort against nonunion actors at all independent recording studios, not just your own. That's the call you should make to the union -- to ask how you can participate. That beats the alternatives you have suggested. Eschewing nonunion sessions would jeopardize your job but benefit no one; you would be replaced, and the sessions would continue. Passivity is no better: it would allow the strike to go on and on, something deleterious to the union actors, the small producers, your employer and your conscience.</p>
        <p>Brice Peyre, a spokesman for the Screen Actors Guild, one of the striking unions (the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists is the other), thinks you should blow the whistle -- softly. ''Quietly tip off SAG and/or Aftra so that their members can arrange to picket the studio in advance and attempt to talk the actor out of scabbing against the union,'' he says.</p>
        <p>I don't agree. Calling in the pickets would be a selective action taken against a single company -- yours. Worse still, you would be using privileged information to harm your own boss. And there is something unseemly in creeping around behind his back. That an action must be undertaken in secret is sometimes a clue to its dubious nature, as we also see in the nonunion actors' desire to remain unidentified.</p>
        <p>Company policy allows me a certain number of vacation weeks per year. My manager, in an effort to be generous (or liked), offered me an extra week -- but I am not to mark it on my time sheet. Do I take his offer, since he indulges in an extra week himself, or follow company policy? -Anonymous</p>
        <p>You ought not accept the extra vacation week unless your manager can offer it without the need for false paperwork. A manager should have the maximum flexibility to reward his employees, but when his reward demands deceit, it's not flexibility; it's fraud. Given your company's policy, an extra week is no more his to give than is that nice Xerox machine down in the copy room.</p>
        <p>Just because your manager takes an extra week himself, deceiving his own boss, does not make the practice more legitimate for you. As my mother always said, If your manager jumped off the roof or engineered some kind of complicated kickback scheme, would you jump off the roof or engineer some kind of complicated kickback scheme? You may well deserve that vacation, but you should not lie on your time sheet to get it.</p>
