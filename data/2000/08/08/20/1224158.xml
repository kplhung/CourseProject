        <p>The freshly minted members of the United States men's Olympic gymnastic team were filtering out of the Celtics' locker room -- a shamrock-clad setting they borrowed during the Olympic trials this weekend -- when John Roethlisberger pulled Jamie Natalie aside tonight.</p>
        <p>Just moments earlier, both were standing on a platform at the conclusion of the trials at the Fleet Center, lined up like pageant contestants waiting for their names to be called. Although the top four members were set by their combined scores from the July nationals and these trials, there was no way to know which two gymnasts the selection committee would pick to join Blaine Wilson, Paul Hamm, Sean Townsend and Stephen McCain on the United States team.</p>
        <p>The committee spent 30 minutes trying to decide before parading the gymnasts back onto the stage to learn their fate in front of everyone. Then, a few seconds after Paul Hamm's 17-year-old twin brother, Morgan, was announced, the 30-year-old Roethlisberger heard his name tumble out of the loudspeaker, too. In an instant, he bent over in tears and staggered forward to take his place among the six-man Olympic team for the third time.</p>
        <p>Then there was the stunned Natalie. Named as the alternate despite finishing ahead of Morgan Hamm and Roethlisberger in the all-around competition, Natalie was trying to manufacture a smile as the rest of the team kicked around falling streamers like kids tromping through leaves.</p>
        <p>''It's hard for Jamie,'' said Roethlisberger, who finished seventh over all. ''I've always been a proponent of going by the score you make and letting that decide things. I've been given an opportunity. For everything I've done over the last few years, I think I deserve it. But I feel for Jamie.''</p>
        <p>That is why Roethlisberger -- known for his role as mentor on the team -- wanted to speak to the 21-year-old Natalie alone after the selection ceremony.</p>
        <p>''We talked for about 10 minutes,'' Roethlisberger said. ''It was just the two of us. I just wanted him to know that he's not an alternate, and that he's just as much a part of the team as anyone else. I told him I never wanted to hear him refer to himself as an alternate after tonight.''</p>
        <p>The conversation seemed to soothe Natalie. When he entered the interview room, he hid any bitter feelings well.</p>
        <p>''We all knew the rules and the procedure when we came here, so I don't have a question in my mind that the committee made the right choice,'' Natalie said. ''There are mixed feelings, but I know Morgan is excellent, and to put John on the team was a no-brainer.''</p>
        <p>Other gymnasts privately questioned it. Natalie was the only member of the team to hit a score as high as 9.9 on the high bar. If the selection committee needed specialists to round out the team, why not Natalie? Roethlisberger's best score on any apparatus tonight was a 9.675 on the rings. Natalie had a 9.625 on two events, the floor exercise and parallel bars, plus his 9.9.</p>
        <p>''We went with the guys we thought could get the job done,'' said the team's coach, Peter Kormann, who was on the selection committee. ''It's not because of brothers like the Hamms or personalities. This was about what was best for the team. This is the team we believe can bring home a medal.''</p>
        <p>There is a human interest element to the team, as well. The Hamm brothers from Waukesha, Wis., are the first twins to compete on a men's Olympic gymnastic team.</p>
        <p>''I was so stunned they called my name,'' said Morgan Hamm, who finished sixth, just behind Natalie. ''I think it's pretty amazing that Paul and I will do this together.''</p>
        <p>They will all follow Wilson's lead. Tattooed and pierced, Wilson is the team's matinee idol and the best hope for an individual gold medal. Wilson was unflappable during the trials, just as he was after winning his fifth national title in July. As rebellious as Wilson is, he is team oriented and was the first to give a warm embrace to the overjoyed Roethlisberger on the platform.</p>
        <p>''It was indescribable, especially after all the ups and downs over the last five years'' said Roethlisberger, who will retire after next month's Olympics. ''On my last event, I wasn't sure if that was it for me.''</p>
        <p>His last apparatus was the rings. If he was anxious, Roethlisberger did not show it. He stuck his landing and then absorbed the applause, not knowing if that was it for him. He did not know if enduring all the injuries and putting in all the extra effort would end at that moment. So he absorbed the applause a little longer than usual. And then he hugged his father and coach, Fred Roethlisberger, a little harder than normal.</p>
        <p>''If that was my last time on the floor, I wanted to enjoy it,'' Roethlisberger said. ''To make this team, it's the sweetest one by far.''</p>
        <p>He wanted one last chance. Although Roethlisberger has already found personal happiness with his marriage to a schoolteacher, he wanted to end his career with one last chance at an Olympic medal. Not only is Roethlisberger a card-toting member of Middle America, but he has also been at the core of the American team's character for 11 years, which has included three national titles for him.</p>
        <p>''I think maybe there will be some hard feeling with Jamie,'' Paul Hamm said. ''But I think everything will be all right. I think everyone knows what John being on the team means.''</p>
