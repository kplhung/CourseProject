        <p>THE Independent is the Jekyll and Hyde of Hamptons restaurants. This split-personality spot opened in 1998 at 2468 Main Street in Bridgehampton (631-537-5110) and drew an instant yawn from restaurant critics who dismissed it as a yuppie meat market, where 20- and 30-somethings met and mingled, rather than a serious eating place. Three years later, it is still trying to walk both paths -- simultaneously catering to patrons of all ages at dinner time and posting a guard out front who keeps the hip youngsters in line and orderly as they wait to enter this often-crowded hot spot later in the evening.</p>
        <p>I too gave it a wide berth because this column is devoted to value dining: restaurants with gifted chefs, modest prices and often marvelous food, not pricey-trendy venues. And the Independent's seafood skewed menu is no bargain. Entrees cost from $23 to $32, pastas $22, a side of sauteed spinach is $8 and appetizers run from $8 to $13.</p>

        <p>THE Independent is the Jekyll and Hyde of Hamptons restaurants. This split-personality spot opened in 1998 at 2468 Main Street in Bridgehampton (631-537-5110) and drew an instant yawn from restaurant critics who dismissed it as a yuppie meat market, where 20- and 30-somethings met and mingled, rather than a serious eating place. Three years later, it is still trying to walk both paths -- simultaneously catering to patrons of all ages at dinner time and posting a guard out front who keeps the hip youngsters in line and orderly as they wait to enter this often-crowded hot spot later in the evening.</p>
        <p>I too gave it a wide berth because this column is devoted to value dining: restaurants with gifted chefs, modest prices and often marvelous food, not pricey-trendy venues. And the Independent's seafood skewed menu is no bargain. Entrees cost from $23 to $32, pastas $22, a side of sauteed spinach is $8 and appetizers run from $8 to $13.</p>
        <p>An ad that appeared in an East End newspaper earlier this summer provided an opportunity to visit the Independent and still maintain the price line. It offered a nightly prix fixe dinner of boiled lobster, smoked baby-back ribs, coleslaw, corn on the cob and ice cream or sorbet for $24.95. Not the buy of the century, but not bad either, especially by Hamptons standards. A call to the restaurant disclosed that two other fixed price dinners -- steak and mussels, each with French fries -- were vailable at that same price.</p>
        <p>The only problem with the Independent's special dinners is finding them. All three are good values and two of those sampled were splendid, straightforward renditions of simple well-prepared dishes, but none are on the menu. Unless someone has prior knowledge of their existence and requests them, they might not even be mentioned. A waitress explained that because they are popular, the restaurant sometimes runs out, therefore the staff members verbally informs customers if they're available and says nothing if they're not. Unfortunately, they don't always remember to. Besides, the restaurant lists choices like soft-shell crabs and local sea bass on the menu even though they do not have an unlimited supply of these items, so why not the prix fixe dinners? In other words, if you've got something good, why hide it?</p>
        <p>And these meals are good. The tender, full-of-beef-flavor hanger steak au poivre, though thin, was done medium rare as ordered, and the velvety, mellow sauce that complemented it had none of the harsh peppercorn bite sometimes experienced in this dish. A clump of soft, succulent sauteed baby spinach and a thatch of slim, crisp, first-rate French fries escort the large steak.</p>
        <p>At least as admirable is a selection that combines hearty and light eating choices: a grilled one-pound lobster and smoked baby-back ribs. The shell-fish was fresh, with a whipped lemon-butter dipping sauce that clung to the sweet morsels of meat, and the meaty, fall-away tender ribs in a wonderfully sticky molasses-laced sauce sported a crusty almost caramelized surface. The meal's supporting players more than held their own: a mound of creamy, wispy coleslaw containing carrots and red and green cabbage and an ear of young, small kenneled melt-in-the-mouth local corn. A heaping portion of Champagne-steamed mussels surround a funnel filled with French fries. The tiny, gritless shellfish arrived in a fine garlicky wine sauce, but alas, they were barely lukewarm.  Nevertheless, we would have sopped up that delicious sauce had not the bread been dry, either because it was a day old or from being warmed once too often.</p>
        <p>Dessert is limited to three scoops of ice cream (vanilla, chocolate and pistachio) or three of sorbet (mango, orange, raspberry). All except the tasteless, overly icy orange passed muster. So did most of the satisfying food sampled at this Hampton's outpost of an au currant TriBeCa restaurant, with its candles, skylights, paper over cloth tables, striking white walls and blonde wood.</p>
        <p>Is it more a nightclub than a destination restaurant? The food we sampled at the Independent held its own.  Yet, the consistency, polish and professionalism, the little touches and niceties that characterize a superior spot, are missing. The young staff displays a nightclub mentality. We did not receive a hello upon entering or a goodbye when departing. The check was presented without a thank you. After waiting in vain for water, we had to ask for it. Dishes were auctioned off at the table (''Who gets the steak?'') and even on a slow Sunday night, we experienced long delays after ordering and between courses.</p>
        <p>Does the Independent serve some commendable food? Yes. Does it offer fine dining? No.</p>
        <p>Openings</p>
        <p>The Wild Goose, a 60-seat restaurant with a French-trained chef-owner, opened in late July at 4805 Depot Lane in Cutchogue (631-734-4145).  Frank Coe, who had been the executive chef at Druids and before that a line chef at Daniel and Le Bernadin in Manhattan, is offering French-influenced dishes, most of which are in the $16 to $19 range. His menu changes every two to three days. Among the recent entrees was warm duck breast salad and seared tuna nicoise. Mr. Cole, who has worked as a chef in England, France, Australia and Singapore, plans to serve game dishes in the fall. His wife, Barbara, runs the dining rooms at this stand-alone spot where the Blue Top, a casual bar and restaurant, had been.</p>
