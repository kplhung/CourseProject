        <p>Q In the sale of a co-op apartment, what is the rationale for the substantial flip tax paid by the seller? . . . Sol Milton, Bayside, N.Y.</p>
        <p>A Stuart M. Saft, a Manhattan lawyer who is also chairman of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums, said that a flip tax is a transfer fee paid to a co-op corporation on the sale of a co-op apartment. The fee is usually calculated as a percentage of the gross sale price. The percentage ranges from 1 to 3 percent, with 2 percent being common. And while the flip tax can be paid by either the buyer or seller, Mr. Saft said, it is typically paid by the seller.</p>

        <p>Q In the sale of a co-op apartment, what is the rationale for the substantial flip tax paid by the seller? . . . Sol Milton, Bayside, N.Y.</p>
        <p>A Stuart M. Saft, a Manhattan lawyer who is also chairman of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums, said that a flip tax is a transfer fee paid to a co-op corporation on the sale of a co-op apartment. The fee is usually calculated as a percentage of the gross sale price. The percentage ranges from 1 to 3 percent, with 2 percent being common. And while the flip tax can be paid by either the buyer or seller, Mr. Saft said, it is typically paid by the seller.</p>
        <p>''During the last few years many apartment corporations have enacted flip taxes to generate additional revenue with which to maintain and upgrade their buildings,'' Mr. Saft said. He added that in most cases, fees derived from flip taxes are added to the building's reserve fund and used for capital improvements rather than operating expenses.</p>
        <p>''The belief is that a building in good condition will produce higher sales prices,'' Mr. Saft said. ''That benefits sellers, who receive a higher price for their apartment, and buyers, who can be comfortable knowing that the cost of future upgrades of the building will be offset by flip-tax fees paid into the fund.'' Mr. Saft said that there is also a common belief that since a building is aging while the seller is living in it, the seller should share in the cost of preserving it.</p>
        <p>He pointed out that under the New York Business Corporation Law, unless the original sponsor included a flip tax in the original offering plan, such a fee can be instituted only by an amendment to the proprietary lease or occupancy agreement. Such amendments must typically be approved by at least a majority of the shareholders. ''A flip tax cannot be imposed by the board,'' Mr. Saft said.</p>
        <p>A Covenant In a Deed</p>
        <p>Q The deed to my house has an old covenant stating that I must make a $300 yearly contribution to the upkeep of the nearby Presbyterian church. Although the church has never made any demand for payment, would such a covenant be enforceable? . . . Coleman Hoite, Bronx, N.Y.</p>
        <p>A John Martin, general counsel for All New York Title Agency in White Plains, said that there are two basic types of covenants: negative covenants and affirmative ones. A negative covenant, Mr. Martin said, prevents or restricts a property owner.  For example, he said, a covenant that prohibits a property from being used for commercial purposes would be a negative covenant.</p>
        <p>Such covenants, he said, are usually binding on those who subsequently acquire title to the land; as a result, they are said to ''run with the land.''</p>
        <p>An affirmative covenant, on the other hand, is usually personal in nature between the buyer and seller and generally does not run with the land to bind future owners.</p>
        <p>''There are, of course, exceptions,'' Mr. Martin said, explaining that affirmative covenants to pay the cost of maintenance of streets, driveways, party walls and beaches in a development have been held to be so connected to the real estate that they must be considered to run with the land.</p>
        <p>In the letter writer's case, Mr. Martin said, it would appear that since a contribution for the upkeep of a nearby church would probably not be considered ''connected to the real estate,'' it is not likely that such a covenant would bind anyone other than the first owner who took title subject to the covenant.</p>
