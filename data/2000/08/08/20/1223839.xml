        <p>SOME 140 years ago, the job might have gone something like this: Word had come that the Union Army was moving north for a fight, up in Pennsylvania somewhere. You would have loaded up the small wagon with glass or iron plates, chemicals, food -- and your best samples, of course, in case the soldiers wanted to see the quality of your work.  You would have set up at the bivouac, near the enlisted men, like all the peddlers, coffin makers, provisioners and hangers-on who move with an army, but you might just have been lucky enough to find space near the officers' tents. You wouldn't have been alone. There might have been a dozen other photographers in camp. But there was work enough for all, taking portraits from dawn till dusk.</p>
        <p>Everyone wanted a likeness to send home.</p>
        <p>For the wet-plate and tintype photographer John Coffer, it is as if the 19th century were today and his contemporaries were not Cindy Sherman and Thomas Struth but Mathew Brady, Timothy O'Sullivan and a host of itinerant portrait makers who plied their trade until the dawn of the modern era. Mr. Coffer, 48, has for more than 20 years been practicing one of the earliest methods of photography and living the life that went with it.  He has crisscrossed the country by horse- and ox-drawn wagon in an 11,000-mile odyssey, making pictures.</p>
        <p>He is now ensconced alone on a farm he bought in 1985 in the Finger Lakes region of New York State, where he lives with his horses and oxen, without heat, light, electricity, telephone or running water. His cabin is his darkroom, and his wagon is parked right out front. Spending time with Mr. Coffer, it's hard to sort out which came first, the lifestyle or the photography. The two seem to go together, inevitably, as methods of simplification in a complex world, or as he calls it, ''purity.''</p>
        <p>''John Coffer is an American original,'' said Mark Osterman, a photographic process historian at the George Eastman House and an accomplished wet-plate photographer himself. ''He was among the first to revive the wet plate process, and no one has been doing it continuously longer or better.''</p>
        <p>Wet plate is the name of the process that displaced the daguerreotype in the 1850's and, for a time, paper photography. It involves coating a glass plate with an ether-based emulsion called collodion, sensitizing it with silver, and exposing it in the camera while the emulsion is still wet. The outcome is a negative image on glass. By one of those paradoxes of light, if it is underexposed and backed by a dark surface, the image reads as a positive -- an ambrotype. Collodion can also be poured onto a japanned iron plate, producing a similar one-of-kind positive. This is the so-called tintype, although it contains no tin.</p>
        <p>Mr. Coffer never considered himself an artist and, like his predecessors, has rarely made a picture he didn't intend to sell on the spot.</p>
        <p>But he came to his hand-made life and hand-made photography out of a single desire for a way of living without gimmicks. ''Photography and food are a lot alike,'' he said. ''You can't really appreciate the flavor of a tomato unless you grow your own. Commercial living and commercial photography have leached out all the diversity, variety and intensity.''</p>
        <p>But commercial recognition, at least, appears to have caught up with him. Mr Coffer's first exhibition of ambrotypes and tintypes is on view at Margaret Bodell's Wall Street Viewing Room through Sept. 21, and he has been invited by the South Street Seaport Museum to photograph the ''old hotel'' memorialized by Joseph Mitchell's stories before its renovation by the museum.  ''Call me an artist if you want to,'' says Mr. Coffer, ''but in the last century, the artist was usually the amateur and the tintypist was the professional.''</p>
        <p>At a rugged 6-foot-3, Mr. Coffer seems fitted for the rigors of life and photography without digital gadgets, but he had to make a long journey toward both. In 1976, the Bicentennial year, he was living in Florida, working for a local photo studio shooting everything from fashion models to graduation portraits and spending his spare time surfing. Something of a history buff, he heard about a Civil War re-enactment taking place in Tennessee and on a whim decided to see what it was like and try out an old camera he had bought.</p>
        <p>What Mr. Coffer found was, in his words, a collection of ''amateur historians and cycle gang members.'' But they were also resourceful people who made their own costumes and regarded the past as alive and important.  And they studied old photographs as attentively as scholars do the Talmud. One re-enactor made the casual comment that ''no Civil War encampment was complete without a horse-drawn photographer,'' and on his way back home, Mr. Coffer found himself suddenly looking at roads differently.</p>
        <p>''The more I thought about it, the more I wanted to try a different way of living,'' he said. ''We're constantly pushed forward at a faster and faster pace. I wanted to know what we were giving up.'' Two years later he had sold his condominium and was in Pennsylvania, learning from the Amish how to drive a horse-drawn wagon.  He left there with $125, a horse named Brownie, a covered wagon, his antique camera, chemicals and a bedroll. He has been traveling the same way ever since.  ''I don't consider myself an eccentric,'' he said. ''I just find a team of oxen more beautiful than a John Deere tractor.''</p>
        <p>Anyone who has seen the film ''The Straight Story,'' about an elderly man who makes a spiritually profound Midwestern journey on a lawnmower, can begin to understand the sense of freedom and expansiveness Mr.  Coffer found on the American road.</p>
        <p>''Every day was an adventure,'' he said. Traveling by back roads and pasturing Brownie in farmers' fields, he discovered a still mostly rural America, by turns generous, amused and suspicious. He has been arrested, shot at, deliberately run off the road, chased out of town under suspicion of being a gypsy and hit by a car. He has also been wined and dined, regaled with innumerable stories around wood stoves, shown children's moth collections and photographed as a celebrity. (His travels were covered by network television, the wire services and People magazine.) He learned how to do his own smithing and shoeing and raised a pair of oxen during a stay in Iowa. He even got married during a stopover in Oregon.</p>
        <p>But most of all, Mr. Coffer found people fascinated by his photography. ''I faced the same challenge as a 19th-century photographer attracting customers,'' he said. ''Wanted!'' Mr. Coffer's handbill says, ''a hundred thousand men, women and children to go to the new gallery and get their pictures made in the same day.'' He set up shop where he could at fairs, in people's yards, next to motels, in back of firehouses, even on main streets in towns with names like Intercourse and Java. He has also documented Civil War re-enactments and taught other photographers how to do it. His images of the 1997 Antietam re-enactment are so meticulous that only an occasional participant's paunch gives away the contemporary setting.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Coffer started out, most ''antique'' commercial photography was actually Polaroid, tinted or covered with brown cellophane to look old. Since collodion is developed on the spot, he, too, could offer near-instant gratification but with more substantial results. He learned to make  beautiful cases and lockets, turning his photos into keepsakes, as they would have been presented originally. Mr. Coffer worked initially with commercially coated ''dry'' plates and tintypes because there was no way to learn the wet-plate formulas and techniques. Seeking information, he once visited the Smithsonian, only to be told, ''Let us know when you find out how it's done.''</p>
        <p>He began to find out in 1980 while wintering in Jacksonville, Ore. He discovered a cache of old photography manuals and equipment in the local museum. He also saw a copy of William Crawford's ''Keepers of the Light,'' the first modern book to document historic photographic processes. ''I realized it was possible to be truly faithful to past practices,'' Mr. Coffer said. Looking at wet-plate images, one can see why the process is so compelling. The collodion emulsion produces images of startling precision. There is complex interplay between background and foreground, detail and blurring. This winter, Mr. Coffer for the first time began to photograph ''as an artist,'' not as a portraitist. The images -- all taken near the cabin he built himself -- combine simplicity and clarity. The bough of an ice-covered pine, for example, is transformed into a still-life of Japanese delicacy. One has the simultaneous sense of things seen and things glimpsed at the edge of visibility.</p>
        <p>Collodion's uncanny quality of presence and absence has attracted a growing number of artists, including Sally Mann, Luis Gonzalez Palma, Mark and France Scully Osterman, who publish ''The Collodion Journal,'' and the filmmaker Stephen Berkman, who took a tutorial with Mr. Coffer and has made what is probably the first modern collodion moving picture. In describing her own photographs, Ms. Mann captured the paradoxical beauty of the process: ''They embrace time and memory, and become the still point at which the two intersect.''</p>
        <p>John Coffer seems to have achieved his own still point where past and present intersect. But his newfound identity as an artist may alter that.</p>
        <p>The demands of the farm, which he bought at his wife's urging (they are now divorced), increasingly conflict with the demands of art. He has written a manual of collodion technique and regularly gives workshops. ''With the growing interest in my work,'' he said, ''I'm free to think about what I want to shoot. But the farm is hard work. The animals have to be tended and I don't make back what it costs to raise them.'' And that makes him think again about hitching up the photographic wagon parked in the front yard.</p>
        <p>''Life on the road taught me how little I need in order to live,'' he said. ''I'm beginning to feel cluttered here.  What's the adage, either the trip serves the thing or the thing serves the trip? Out there in my wagon, I'm not on a trip. I'm home.''</p>
