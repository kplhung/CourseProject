        <p>Peter Meitzler knew he had a fare after making eye contact with two women standing on a corner near the Flatiron Building on a recent Sunday afternoon.</p>
        <p>Mr. Meitzler pulled up and asked, ''Would you like a ride?'' The women said they would. But instead of getting into the back seat of a yellow cab, the women hopped into a carriage attached to the back of a 21-speed bicycle for a ride up Park Avenue to Grand Central Terminal.</p>
        <p>In most other large American cities, bicycle taxis, often called pedicabs, are restricted from downtowns and end up providing joy rides around parks or tourist routes to people who start and finish in the same spot, the way victoria cabs operate in Central Park.</p>
        <p>Manhattan, according to Mr. Meitzler and his friendly competitor, George Bliss, the owner of Pedicabs of New York, is one of the few places you can make money by giving people bicycle rides as a means of getting people where they need to go.</p>
        <p>''On more than one occasion I've gotten someone somewhere in a hurry because nobody else could,'' said Mr. Meitzler, the owner of the Manhattan Rickshaw Company, with three pedicabs.</p>
        <p>''New York could be a role model for the rest of the megacities of the world,'' said Mr. Bliss, who has nine cabs. ''It's a critical time to establish a sustainable model of urban transportation, so that Asia doesn't just follow our unsustainable model, which of course the auto industry is pushing.''</p>
        <p>When they are off from their day jobs, Mr. Meitzler and his 15 part-time drivers can often be found in places packed with pedestrians, like Greenwich Village and Midtown. Rides cost 50 cents a minute per person. A driver can generally make between $20 and $25 a night. The Altoids ads on the sides of the cabs pay for the costs associated with the vehicles, including $1,200 a year in insurance.</p>
        <p>After dropping the women off at Grand Central Terminal, Mr. Meitzler was approached by Irvin Ballester, 19, who was visiting Manhattan from Ansonia, Conn. ''Do you know of any pork-on-a-stick places?'' Mr. Ballester asked.</p>
        <p>Told there might be one at the Port Authority Bus Terminal, Mr. Ballester and his friend, Claire Brandt, 20, agreed to take the ride. Ten minutes and one unconventional ride down 42nd Street later, Mr. Ballester and Ms. Brandt returned to  Grand Central, mission accomplished.</p>
        <p>Perhaps it was the sight of a bicyclist with two passengers, or the jingle of his bell, or perhaps it was the warm spring day. Regardless, as Mr. Meitzler rode through Midtown it was not uncommon for pedestrians on Park Avenue or Broadway to say hello or wave to him or the passengers.</p>
        <p>''It's an automatic icebreaker,'' Mr. Meitzler said of his cab. ''It just totally melts the New York edge.''</p>
