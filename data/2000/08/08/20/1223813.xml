        <p>OLD WETHERSFIELD is a particularly serendipitous setting for an exhibition called ''Lost Gardens of New England and Wethersfield.'' The show can be seen through Sept. 4 at the Wethersfield Museum as well as in a garden across the street, behind the Webb-Deane-Stevens Museum.</p>
        <p>The director of the Webb-Deane-Stevens Museum, Jennifer Eifrig, said the collaboration, supported by the Connecticut Humanities Council, was their first effort to work together as institutions. ''We were inspired by the restoration of the Amy Cogswell Garden,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Brenda Milkofsky, the director of the Wethersfield Historical Society, which operates the Wethersfield Museum, added that ''we all feel that horticulture was such an important part of Wethersfield's past, that the opportunity to call attention to it in the new century is kind of compelling.'' (In the 19th century, when the town's onion trade declined, eight seed companies developed trial gardens in plots that had been onion patches.)</p>
        <p>Outside the Wethersfield Museum recently, the finishing touches were being put on a memorial garden in the round: curved benches placed around a centered sculpture and plantings. Next door, at the Hurlbut-Dunham House, a perennial border in the Colonial Revival style is striking against the colonaded porch.</p>
        <p>Inside the Wethersfield Museum, which is in the Keeney Memorial Cultural Center, the garden theme continues in several ways. The large gallery with shuttered windows exudes a conservatory feeling. A working stone fountain, surrounded by an artificial garden, takes center stage, a corner of the room embellished by a latticed screen of climbing roses and garden tools. They set an appropriate tone for the wall-hung exhibition of more than 40 images of now-vanished New England town, country and suburban gardens dating from 1810 through 1930, borrowed from the collection of the Society for the Preservation of New England antiquities in Boston.</p>
        <p>In addition, representations of Wethersfield gardens are drawn from the archives of the Webb-Deane-Stevens Museum and the Wethersfield Historical Society. Watercolors, photographs, drawings, stereo-view cards, landscape plants, garden supply catalogs, even a mid-19th-century nurseryman's bill illustrate major themes of American landscape history.</p>
        <p>In the middle of the 19th century a distinctly American design emerged, embracing a landscape of natural land forms and native plant materials, introduced by the landscape architects Andrew Jackson Downing (1815-1852) and the Hartford native, Frederick Law Olmsted (1822-1903). Shortly before 1900, New Englanders returned to history for inspiration and came up with revival gardens that re-interpreted Colonial style.</p>
        <p>The exhibition is divided into thematic groupings of urban gardens, family gardens, professionally designed landscapes, Colonial revival gardens and landscape structures like greenhouses. Idyllic spaces range from a series of curvilinear terraces behind lilac hedges, to a park with serpentine river, kitchen gardens, grapery and hothouse, to a Gothic cottage's parterre garden (flower beds framed by boxwood). There is also the re-created Amy Cogswell Colonial revival-style garden set across the street behind the Webb House.</p>
        <p>In 1919, when the Connecticut Society of the Colonial Dames of America purchased the Webb House from the photographer and antiquarian Wallace Nutting, they opened a tea room and installed a garden designed by Amy Cogswell, a graduate of the first school of landscape architecture for women. After World War II, the garden disappeared along with its plans. In 1996 the original plans reappeared, and, last year, a garden maintaining the spirit of the original was installed. Visitors now stroll on walkways among beds of poppies, peonies, lavender, hollyhocks, foxglove and roses.</p>
        <p>The Wethersfield Museum (Keeney Memorial Center, 200 Main Street, Old Wethersfield) is open Tuesday through Saturday, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and Sunday, 1 to 4 p.m. (860-529-7656). The Amy Cogswell Garden, 211 Main Street, is open during Webb-Deane-Stevens Museum hours, Wednesday to Monday, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.</p>
