        <p>Drivers at the Short-Time Motel</p>
        <p>By Eugene Gloria.</p>
        <p>Penguin, paper, $15.95.</p>
        <p>Like so many poets with a split cultural heritage -- in this case, Filipino and American -- Eugene Gloria hears America singing, and its song is not always welcoming. In one poem, he refers to himself as ''anthemless,'' and elsewhere, after placing himself firmly in what he refers to as ''America's brave margins,'' he remarks, almost matter-of-factly, ''We have learned to love / this road, which lies down like pythons, / refuses to forgive our excesses, / refuses to consider us kin.'' Angry about his poor-relation status, Gloria finds a kind of melancholy redemption in stories about his Filipino background. One in particular, about his mother's canny exploitation of her looks during the Japanese occupation, is especially affecting: ''The pretty ones, you said, / were always given more food -- /. . . I remember you in sepia-brown photographs / as a mestiza who equated liberation / with Hershey bars and beige nylons from American GIs -- / and the season of the monsoon as dark as hunger / was not about suffering / but what you knew of beauty.'' Nevertheless, it's resigned anger that sets the tone of ''Drivers at the Short-Time Motel.'' Even the beautiful mother is taken in by the dream she can never fully posses -- in Gloria's words, ''The language of the village withered inside her / when she took up the voice of American movies.'' His poems tend to read more like prose -- they sometimes feel like interesting essays broken into lines -- but Eugene Gloria's vision of life on the cultural sidelines is valuable nonetheless, if only because it is relentless in its pursuit of complicated truths.</p>
