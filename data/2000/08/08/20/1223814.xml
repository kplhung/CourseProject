        <p>IN the early 1950's, when the director Fred Zinnemann read the first draft of the screenplay of ''High Noon,'' he thought it ''nothing short of a masterpiece -- brilliant, exciting and novel in its approach. I could hardly wait to come to grips with it.'' He saw a classic meeting of good and evil, and the focused immediacy of it all happening by a minute or two after noon.

        <p>IN the early 1950's, when the director Fred Zinnemann read the first draft of the screenplay of ''High Noon,'' he thought it ''nothing short of a masterpiece -- brilliant, exciting and novel in its approach. I could hardly wait to come to grips with it.'' He saw a classic meeting of good and evil, and the focused immediacy of it all happening by a minute or two after noon. He knew he had Gary Cooper as Will Kane, the man who has just married and retired as sheriff -- until he hears that an old enemy, Frank Miller, is out of the penitentiary and coming to get him.</p>
        <p>When ''High Noon'' opened, there were those like its screenwriter, Carl Foreman (about to be blacklisted), who said that this simple Western story was a parable of virtue abandoned by old friends in the McCarthy crisis. But most of the world took it as the epitome of heroism on the old frontier, and as a demonstration of the code that Gary Cooper had once shyly explained to another writer, Niven Busch: ''Just make me the hero and everything will be fine.''</p>
        <p>It made for a deeply satisfying contest, and a film full of suspense. Yet it also marks the end of an age when western heroes could be as clear-cut as Cooper. Already in ''Red River'' (1948), John Wayne had been clouded by rage, pride and arrogance, as he would be again in ''The Searchers'' (1956). In the great Anthony Mann westerns of the 1950's (''Winchester 73,''  ''The Far Country,''  ''The Man from Laramie), James Stewart would be a far more ambiguous figure. Even Shane was kept from domesticity by his outlaw nature.</p>
        <p>Nearly 50 years later, a television remake of ''High Noon'' has its premiere tonight on TBS, and it's a harking back to a genre that has few believers. Those drawn into doing ''High Noon'' again feel compelled to find a fresh angle, or a hint of realism, such as had nothing to do with the picture's success in 1952. This new version, written by T. S. Cook (but acknowledging Foreman's original parable) and directed by Ron Hardy, takes the role of the older Mexican woman (Katy Jurado in 1952, Maria Conchita Alonso now) and works out what she means to the town of Hadleyville. That's fine, up to a point: but too much of this particular back story can leave you wondering why Will Kane must stand alone, when the friendly Mrs. Ramirez seems to be running things.</p>
        <p>Hadleyville isn't placed (it was Burbank in 1952; it's near Calgary now). It has no year, no location, no reference to state or territory, no bureaucracy. But now we do have a sense of how the town operates: Helen Ramirez (Alonso), who has ''known'' both Kane and Miller, is the power in the town -- even if Mexican blood and her low-cut gowns keep her from being invited to its big occasions. She owns property. She has white businessmen under her thumb, and she seems central to the deal that the town has to supply the Army.</p>
        <p>A lot of this is new, and it's a gesture toward filling in Zinnemann's stark story. But once money appears as a character, you have to follow its logic. Mrs. Ramirez could buy herself some guns to keep the peace, and look after Will. She could even seek support from the Army. Come to that, is Kane sheriff or marshal? He's called sheriff. But his badge says ''Marshal.'' And it makes a difference, because in many towns there could be a split jurisdiction. That's one reason the Earps found themselves in court after the O.K. Corral. The law took different forms, and sometimes it had wars of its own. So Kane need not have been quite so solitary, unless you reckon that Hadleyville is too small to matter.</p>
        <p>Remaking ''High Noon'' leads us directly into such questions as well as the larger issue of how the western has failed Western history. ''High Noon'' had Cold War resonance (some said it was a Korea analogy), and many read it, as Foreman suggested, as an attack on McCarthyism. But the western died (slowly) because of our rising discontents over its accuracy. The genre built uneasy men into heroes; it ignored women (the wife in both versions of ''High Noon'' is a stiff, not a real point of view); it nearly eliminated American Indians; and it laid down many erroneous ideas about how a new nation evolved west of the Mississippi.</p>
        <p>Still, just because the western has withered doesn't mean the absence of good movies that pursue the history and moods of the West. The classic western was too inflexible to accommodate the actual realities, but there are films that are true to them. I would like to propose a modern tradition that includes ''Chinatown,''  ''The Right Stuff,''  ''Mulholland Falls,''  ''The Shining,''  ''Melvin and Howard,''  ''Bugsy,''  ''Point Blank,''  ''Badlands,''  ''The Last Picture Show'' and  ''Five Easy Pieces,'' plus many of Peckinpah's films. The same issues of liberty and organization, territory and property, integrity and compromise that animated the classic Western are at work. But it begins to be easier to see in these films how Western history advanced by means of compromise, a less famous American imperative than the myth of Manichaean struggle.</p>
        <p>GO back and reconsider ''High Noon,'' and it is instructive to see how often its plot crisis was reworked as the strict western went into decline. Not that many years later, Howard Hawks and John Wayne reacted against the notion that it was a leftist film, with its hero forsaken by the weak townspeople. Quite deliberately, they fashioned a response -- ''Rio Bravo'' (1958) -- in which the sheriff, John T. Chance (Wayne), has a prisoner in his jail, waiting for a circuit judge to come by. But the prisoner's associates are laying siege to the town. For help, he has an old cripple (Walter Brennan), a drunk (Dean Martin) and a kid (Ricky Nelson). ''That's all you've got?'' asks his old friend Ward Bond, anxious to volunteer. ''That's what I've got,'' says Wayne, declining amateurs, do-gooders and sightseers. He wants to keep the task professional. And Hawks and Wayne took the view that lawmen had little time for citizen's arrests -- though Angie Dickinson does get to throw a flower pot in the cause.</p>
        <p>''Rio Bravo'' is far more modern than its cowboy clothes. It's a kind of screwball oater (at least half-aware that the audience was beginning to laugh at the conventions). But no one was as restless with set genres as Hawks. ''Bad Day at Black Rock'' (1954) looks modern -- a 20th-century train drops Spencer Tracy off in the small Nevada town, and he wears today's clothes -- but it's closer to an authentic western. And in the course of its story, the quiet investigator, Tracy, rallies the courage and reasserts law in a demoralized community, as he takes on (with just one arm) one of the screen's most menacing trios (Lee Marvin, Ernest Borgnine and Robert Ryan). All in the name of a Nisei war hero and his father, who was killed by the town.</p>
        <p>In Robert Altman's ''McCabe and Mrs. Miller'' (1971), McCabe (Warren Beatty) is too much the loner to know how to ask for help. He has run afoul of the local syndicate up in the God-forsaken town of Presbyterian Church, and he is going to be hunted down by three very nasty regulators. It's true to McCabe's lonesome self-dramatizing, Mrs. Miller's drugged view of fate and Altman's abiding irony that the hapless McCabe actually kills all three opponents in the falling snow -- without anyone seeing, or realizing, his heroism.</p>
        <p>''High Plains Drifter'' (1972) shows what a canny eye Clint Eastwood has always had for the Gary Cooper legend, and ways to replay it. He is the Stranger come to the wretched town of Lago, where once the sheriff was whipped and killed by three hoodlums while the town stood idly by. This Stranger is an angel of death and retribution who tells the citizens to paint their town red and call it Hell. Written by Ernest Tidyman, ''High Plains Drifter'' employs the poker-faced humor in Eastwood, just as it bows to his Italian master, Sergio Leone. Don't forget that Leone's ''Once Upon a Time in the West'' (1968) begins with a prolonged parody of gunmen waiting at the depot for some Frank Miller to arrive (one of them is Lee Van Cleef, who was there in ''High Noon,'' too). They are tortured by buzzing flies, dripping spouts and the treacle creak of waiting. But then Charles Bronson gets off the train and blows them away.</p>
        <p>I can think of other intriguing variants -- ''Man of the West'' (1958), where Cooper is an ex-outlaw, a diligent townsman now, setting out to hire a schoolteacher for his new community. But he's drawn back into his own past, and he must become virtual sheriff of a ghost town as he destroys his old family. (It's a fine, neglected film, but seen again now, it cries out for a real schoolteacher with a new, unanswerable challenge for the Cooper hero: why he can't read, perhaps.)</p>
        <p>But in those late 50's and early 60's, the western was going through agonies. Even John Ford tried to separate the legend of the gun from its facts in ''The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance'' (1962). But Ford could never thoroughly disown the legend or the pretty way of seeing it. And there are plenty of up-to-date Americans who don't sleep easy without the emotional solace of a six-shooter beneath the pillow.</p>
        <p>Maybe the last variant of the one-against-three shootout from ''High Noon'' (it's one against six in the remake -- inflation!) is that oddity, ''The Shootist'' (1976), in which Wayne plays the dying John Books, a figure known because of his gun. But the legend has cancer and he reckons to make some amends at last (as well as find some diversion) by going up against three bad guys (they are, notably, TV western actors -- Richard Boone, Hugh O'Brian and Bill McKinney). All of this to clean up Carson City, Nev. -- which would become the seat of government for some of the West's most remarkable manipulations of old-fashioned law and decency (but that's the modern story).</p>
        <p>Alas, we are still short on those stories that show how in states like Nevada gamblers, gunmen and broken men remade themselves as part of a self-consciously progressive 20th century. The real reworking of ''High Noon'' should be about Mrs. Ramirez and how the shootout is turned into a tourist attraction. But filmmakers prefer to sentimentalize the bitter sheriff. After all, isn't he the very forefather of Lt. Harry Callahan, ''Dirty Harry'' (1971), the guy who throws away his badge once he's found the very American freedom of going one-on-one with the serial killer -- and leave Miranda rights out of this?</p>
