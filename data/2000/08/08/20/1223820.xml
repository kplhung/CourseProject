        <p>THIS is very much Messiaen's year -- as most years now tend to be. Barely was there time to draw breath after the Brooklyn Philharmonic's presentation of three scenes from ''St. Francois d'Assise'' than the Lincoln Center Festival offered four big pieces in quick succession. And now comes a thoroughly spectacular recording of his greatest solo piano work, the ''Vingt Regards sur l'Enfant-Jesus,'' played by Pierre-Laurent Aimard (Teldec 26868-2).</p>
        <p>As Mr. Aimard points out in an interesting note -- more interesting than the program note proper-- ''this vast fresco brings together everything that made up the composer's world at that time: his spiritual, cultural, musical and technical world.'' Indeed so. These ''Twenty Gazes on the Child Jesus'' are religious illustrations, but made by an artist for whom religious subjects did not imply a limitation. Messiaen saw no reason  that everything he could imagine musically could not be brought into his scenes of veneration and praise: crashing dissonances as well as the sweetest harmony, hectic dances as well as gentle meditations, and a huge range of sounds, some of them weird, some bewildering.</p>

        <p>THIS is very much Messiaen's year -- as most years now tend to be. Barely was there time to draw breath after the Brooklyn Philharmonic's presentation of three scenes from ''St. Francois d'Assise'' than the Lincoln Center Festival offered four big pieces in quick succession. And now comes a thoroughly spectacular recording of his greatest solo piano work, the ''Vingt Regards sur l'Enfant-Jesus,'' played by Pierre-Laurent Aimard (Teldec 26868-2).</p>
        <p>As Mr. Aimard points out in an interesting note -- more interesting than the program note proper-- ''this vast fresco brings together everything that made up the composer's world at that time: his spiritual, cultural, musical and technical world.'' Indeed so. These ''Twenty Gazes on the Child Jesus'' are religious illustrations, but made by an artist for whom religious subjects did not imply a limitation. Messiaen saw no reason  that everything he could imagine musically could not be brought into his scenes of veneration and praise: crashing dissonances as well as the sweetest harmony, hectic dances as well as gentle meditations, and a huge range of sounds, some of them weird, some bewildering.</p>
        <p>All of this is magnificently present in Mr. Aimard's playing. Indeed, there is more than he knows, for he follows the composer in declaring that the one thing omitted from the ''Vingt Regards'' is human love -- despite the fact that his own performance, time and again, reveals that the work is an immense love song. It is the ''Turangalila Symphony'' of the piano, with joyous movements of love music, bounding or still, punctuated by sequences that are more abstract or bizarre.</p>
        <p>With Messiaen's music, it is not possible to separate sacred and secular love; they were as close as the two sides of the heart. Composed in 1944, ''Vingt Regards'' was one of the first works he wrote after meeting the pianist Yvonne Loriod, later his wife, who recorded it, and the music is as much a personal as a professional paean. It is furiously virtuosic, conceived for a musician whose hands could skid and slam and tremble to produce an enormous variety of colors. But it is also, on the composer's part, like the mating display of a colossal bird.</p>
        <p>Mr. Aimard has the full measure of its vigor and its brilliance -- though it is not easy to know what is most impressive here: the vividness of so many different piano sounds or the exemplary directness with which they are executed, the explicitness that matches the music's.</p>
        <p>Messiaen wrote large. The new piano vocabulary he was building up in this work was also an old one, drawn from the most exhibitionist music of Liszt and his successors, like Ravel and Albeniz. But the self-projecting rhetoric of the virtuoso is eliminated. This is not the music of a pianist addressing an audience but that of a composer addressing God -- and addressing, too, as a fellow child of God, the woman he imagined at the keyboard.</p>
        <p>An odd kind of self-effacement is therefore required from the performer -- and splendidly supplied by Mr. Aimard. In one of the most demanding pieces, ''Par Lui Tout a Ete Fait'' (''By Him Was Everything Made''), he brings on a formidable repertory of big effects. He greets the arrival of the ''theme of God'' at the main climax with thunder and lightning, tearing down into the bass with force, weight and resonant power, then throwing off quick, luminous festoons in the upper treble, then doing both at once.</p>
        <p>This is superb, even awe-inspiring, and all the more so because Mr. Aimard puts us in the presence of the music, not of himself. It is not that he performs objectively. Where a lot of French Messiaen playing is thin and mechanical, however glittering, Mr. Aimard is strong and imbues the music with strength. There is a person here. But that person is not asking for applause.</p>
        <p>Rhythm and accentuation are crucial. Mr. Aimard does not curve and shape the music so that it fits his hands and thereby shows off what they can do. Rather, he fits his hands to the music, even if this means going a little against what comes naturally. There are points in ''Par Lui'' that sound awkward and alien. But they sound as if they have to be that way.</p>
        <p>Also impressive in this movement is the way Mr. Aimard alters color, balance and phrasing as he rotates through a figure again and again, so that there is nothing automatic in the repetition. These small but telling changes seem like signs of a motive force that is making the repetition necessary.</p>
        <p>Right through the two-hour cycle there is no relaxation of musical thinking and acting. Where there is mercurial birdsong figuration, Mr. Aimard treats it not just as decorative but finds in it real musical sense. Where the music is slow and long, it is still active, as if in demonstration of the line from the Song of Songs that Messiaen took as the title for one of these pieces: ''I Sleep but my Heart Waketh.''</p>
        <p>MR. AIMARD'S wakefulness in another of the big slow movements, ''Le Baiser de l'Enfant-Jesus'' (''Child Jesus' Kiss''), has extraordinary results. Messiaen's daring recipe for intimacy here was to withdraw into the world of the lounge pianist, with song phrases, soupy harmonies and arpeggios at every opportunity. Often the movement sounds just vulgar, and one has to accept its vulgarity as part of Messiaen's sublime frankness.</p>
        <p>Not on this recording, though. Mr. Aimard shows that the music transcends its sources. It is calm. It is graceful. It breathes freely. Again, the effect comes partly from not jumping to immediate conclusions about style and treatment but, instead, finding what is particular in the detail. Mr. Aimard's approach also brings him the means to build toward a fearsome culmination in this movement, where the music becomes hard as nails. Jesus's kiss is not soppy: it stings.</p>
        <p>Mr. Aimard is a musician who takes his time. His solo recordings are few; this is his first since his wonderful contributions to Sony's Ligeti series. And in this case he has been working on the music for more than three decades, since he learned it as a pupil of Ms. Loriod. The wait was worthwhile.</p>
