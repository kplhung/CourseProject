      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The Jewish Center of Princeton turns 50 this year, and it seemed appropriate to mark the anniversary by looking at the history of the Jewish community in Princeton, which goes back at least five times that long. ''Old Traditions, New Beginnings'' can be seen at both the Jewish Center (to early October, 435 Nassau Street, open Modays through Thursdays 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Fridays 9 to 3) and the Historical Society of Princeton (through March 2001, 158 Nassau Street, Tuesdays through Sundays, noon to 4). The society's section, focuses on early arrivals, family life, social organizations, work and business pursuits, religious traditions and anti-Semitism. The earliest item is an account book dated 1737-1769. A section at the Jewish Center focuses on the growth of the religious community after World War II, including services at Princeton's first synagogue, B'nai Zion (a 1911 photo of the founders, Isador and Sarah Braverman is seen here) to construction of the center.</p>
