        <p>Q: You have just agreed to pay $12 million in back taxes to the Italian government, which claimed that your Monte Carlo residence was merely a tax shelter. Your response has been that people don't understand what it's like to live as you do. What, specifically, don't they understand?</p>
        <p>I am an artist who is working around the world. So I pay the taxes wherever I am. If I sing in Italy, I pay in Italy. If I sing in New York, I pay in New York. I think it's very logical, and I think soon we will have laws like that. But the newspapers were really questioning my honesty, so I said, I will stop fighting and pay, even though I think I have a perfect right. It's a lot of money, eh? I hope you agree with me. Anyhow, I have lost money, but I gained my reputation, and that is exactly what I wanted.</p>

        <p>Q: You have just agreed to pay $12 million in back taxes to the Italian government, which claimed that your Monte Carlo residence was merely a tax shelter. Your response has been that people don't understand what it's like to live as you do. What, specifically, don't they understand?</p>
        <p>I am an artist who is working around the world. So I pay the taxes wherever I am. If I sing in Italy, I pay in Italy. If I sing in New York, I pay in New York. I think it's very logical, and I think soon we will have laws like that. But the newspapers were really questioning my honesty, so I said, I will stop fighting and pay, even though I think I have a perfect right. It's a lot of money, eh? I hope you agree with me. Anyhow, I have lost money, but I gained my reputation, and that is exactly what I wanted.</p>
        <p>Just a few years ago, you were the subject of another controversy when you ended your marriage of 35 years and became involved with Nicoletta Mantovani, who is 35 years your junior. There was a move to keep you from performing for the pope, from taking communion.</p>
        <p>I really don't understand that. In Italy many people are divorced, so many people don't go to church. There are a lot of divorced people, and they are very nice, very sweet people. And there are lots of people who are not divorced, and they are delinquents. I don't know.</p>
        <p>Physically, you have had a very rough few years. You have wrestled with your weight -- you have even had trouble falling to the ground in ''Tosca'' when your character was shot -- and you had a hip and a knee replaced. How important is the body for opera singers?</p>
        <p>Well, the body must move on the stage. Of course, I am big and chubby, I don't move like a guy of 200 pounds or less. But my friend, the last 15 years were the most incredible suffering you can imagine. Bone sickness you cannot describe. You are always in pain -- in bed, out, onstage. But since the operation, that's gone.</p>
        <p>All these controversies, all this suffering -- why does opera seem to attract such operatic personalities, who live lives of such high drama?</p>
        <p>I don't agree. I think it's one of the most boring things in the world. You sing, you study music. Tell me a name of an opera star whose life has been extremely tumultuous.</p>
        <p>Maria Callas.</p>
        <p>Maria Callas's life was more of a star's life. She was married to a man, and all of a sudden she falls in love with another, that is all. That's normal life. But because it's Maria Callas, everything is related to melodrama. I think this is the result of a very beautiful, artistic career, and sometimes a very particular one. Like me, for example. I am very chubby. I make a competition for very young singers. If someone comes out who is chubby like me, he must sing like a god.</p>
        <p>You're about to have a big concert in Madison Square Garden. This is a traditional performance, but in recent years you have become well known for the Three Tenors, the pop duets. You know there are purists and critics who feel that by popularizing opera you have corrupted it.</p>
        <p>So what? Probably if I was a critic, I would try to do the same thing, in order to be important. If they don't want to see us do this, let them go see Domingo now at the Met or me in January, where I will sing an opera. I am an opera fanatic and I am a tenor fanatic. My father is a tenor -- he would change the radio station until he found a tenor, and we would listen. So going onstage to hear two people like Placido and Jose, share the stage with them and at the end of that to get paid! It's the best thing that could happen to you.</p>
        <p>You have recorded with Ricky Martin, B.B. King, Mariah Carey. Are Lil' Kim and Kid Rock next? Or are there popular musicians you wouldn't record with?</p>
        <p>There are many. Most! I have sung with all the best. It was a great honor for me. But there are certainly singers with whom I will not sing -- because my voice will not mix very well with the voice of the other person, or the personality either. That is logical.</p>
        <p>This winter you will be performing ''Aida'' at the Met. Have you heard about the Broadway version -- with music by Elton John and so on? Do you think these classics need to be updated in this way?</p>
        <p>I have heard of it, but I haven't seen it. If opera is brought to pop in the way ''Boh me'' was brought to ''Rent,'' in the most beautiful, sensational way, welcome. I saw the show twice in New York, and I participated in the adaptation into Italian, which Nicoletta staged. Of course, I will not sing in it.</p>
        <p>You will not sing in ''Rent''? We could give you a little head mike and put you in a secondhand sweater.</p>
        <p>I am a chubby one, so . . . I don't dare. No, thank you very much. I'm just a tenor. I hope a good one.</p>
