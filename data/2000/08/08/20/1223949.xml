        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I must object to the article ''Builders May Be Forced to Tear Down Four Houses'' on July 30. It is one-sided and contains several incorrect statements.</p>
        <p>It gives a great deal of space to William and Edward Baker and their feeling that they are being persecuted by their neighbors. There were a great many legal and procedural problems with the way their building permits, now annulled, were obtained. The judge's decision gives all the specifics, but the article failed to mention them.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I must object to the article ''Builders May Be Forced to Tear Down Four Houses'' on July 30. It is one-sided and contains several incorrect statements.</p>
        <p>It gives a great deal of space to William and Edward Baker and their feeling that they are being persecuted by their neighbors. There were a great many legal and procedural problems with the way their building permits, now annulled, were obtained. The judge's decision gives all the specifics, but the article failed to mention them.</p>
        <p>As for the money they say they will lose if the houses are not allowed to stand, they have no one to blame but themselves. They tried to play a shell game with building lots and got caught. They were warned they were building at their own risk when the suit was filed. Their response was to build faster. They also hoped that the mere fact that houses were standing would influence a judge to allow them to remain.</p>
        <p>They have stormed out of meetings with the residents (called by the residents) after insulting those present.</p>
        <p>As for other misstatements, the houses are identical prefab homes. There is nothing varied about them. The wooded area they cleared in violation of town ordinances was a beautiful one, not a dump site. If they really wonder what they did wrong, they should try reading the judge's decision.</p>
