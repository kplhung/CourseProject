        <p>ONE night last month in this town in Northern Italy, a small group of American college students entered a whitewashed barn in the middle of a Tuscan field.

The students sat on folding chairs in the bare white room, the highly polished wood floor gleaming in the bright light.</p>
        <p>A moment later, six men and a woman entered from a door behind the seats. As they walked toward the center of the room, they sang what sounded like a very old and long-forgotten song, rooted in an Afro-Caribbean tradition.

        <p>ONE night last month in this town in Northern Italy, a small group of American college students entered a whitewashed barn in the middle of a Tuscan field. It was late, about 10:30, and the strong heat of the day had finally dissipated. The students sat on folding chairs in the bare white room, the highly polished wood floor gleaming in the bright light.</p>
        <p>A moment later, six men and a woman entered from a door behind the seats. As they walked toward the center of the room, they sang what sounded like a very old and long-forgotten song, rooted in an Afro-Caribbean tradition. The men wore long-sleeved white shirts and black pants, the woman, a short-sleeved red blouse and long red skirt.</p>
        <p>The seven people did not seem to pay attention to those watching and continued to sing intensely to one another while moving in a series of intricate patterns that depicted the cycle of human life and death. Except that the cycle went backward, as if a film were rewinding. One of the men emerged from under the skirt of the woman, but rather than as an infant, he was born as an old man holding a cane. As the students watched, listening to the intense singing, the man grew younger, moving with greater and greater ease, until it seemed he had become a child.</p>
        <p>The work lasted little more than an hour. At the end, the performers suddenly stopped singing and abruptly left the room the way they had entered. In the ringing silence, nobody moved.</p>
        <p>Later that night, on the nearly three-hour drive south to the town of Orvieto, where they were staying, the students -- from the Fordham University Orvieto Theater Institute -- were quiet. They seemed absorbed in thought about what they had just experienced.</p>
        <p>What they had seen was ''Action'' at the Workcenter in Pontedera, founded in 1986 by the renowned Polish theater director and theorist Jerzy Grotowski, who died last year. His successor, who had taken the role of the old man, is Thomas Richards, a 38-year-old American.</p>
        <p>Mr. Richards has directed ''Action'' since 1994. I have seen it three times in the last five years, and each time the work seems to deepen in meaning. When I saw it with my students last month I began to think of it as an example of the sacred art of spiritual transmission, a living experience of theater that contains the DNA code for theater's essence.</p>
        <p>What ''Action'' does is make palpable the pure performance energy of those who are enacting it -- the doers. The effect on those watching is direct and unambiguous: the observers become witnesses to the energy, which allows them to reach a more explicit, even vibratory, level of physical self-awareness themselves.</p>
        <p>While the movements and singing are private acts for the doers and not presented as if ''Action'' were a typical performance, the effect for those watching the deep connection that the doers experience with their inner selves is like being in the presence of people who are unconditionally generous. This seeking of inner transformation, rooted in the vibrations of sound and corporeal awareness, raises the level of self-awareness -- of being in the body -- both for those observing and those being observed. The result is the pure transmission of theater as the essence of life.</p>
        <p>''Action'' itself is based on ancient songs, archaic forms of movement and fragments of a Coptic text about life, death and transformation. The linguistic content of the songs is not the focus. Instead, the songs are used to reveal what Grotowski referred to as a vibratory language. Through work on the melody, rhythm and pronunciation of the songs, sonic resonance becomes a tool for an increased awareness by the singers of the body's inner energy.</p>
        <p>More than 1,000 people have made the trip to the Tuscan barn to experience ''Action,'' including theater companies and individuals who have written asking to see the work. There is no charge. Usually about 8 to 12 people watch at any one time. It has also been a part of residency programs by the Workcenter in Sao Paulo, Brazil; Marseille, France, and Wroclaw, Poland, among other places.</p>
        <p>The Fordham Orvieto program is a four-week summer theater school that concentrates on what Grotowski and Konstantin Stanislavsky called physical actions: how an actor creates precise movements with the body as a way to communicate character, story and the actor's intentions. After morning classes, for example, on the day they went to Pontedera, the students had had a session with a Japanese Butoh movement teacher. That night, after seeing ''Action'' at the Workcenter, the students met briefly with Mr. Richards and his main collaborator of 13 years, Mario Biagini, 35, who is also in the piece.</p>
        <p>Mr. Richards, who worked with Grotowski for 14 years, is the son of Lloyd Richards, the American theater director and former dean of the Yale School of Drama. The younger Mr. Richards and Mr. Biagini receive a salary from the Fondazione Pontedera Teatro, a theater in Pontedera supported by the Italian government. The Fondazione, in turn, sponsors the Workcenter, which is a separate research organization and since 1996 has been formally called the Workcenter of Jerzy Grotowski and Thomas Richards.</p>
        <p>Since the Workcenter does not have the means to pay any other company members, those who are selected (usually for a year) must support themselves during their stay. Some get government grants or scholarships from their countries and often find a way to remain for more than 12 months. This year, four of the other five participants in ''Action'' are European; the fifth is Algerian. Auditions take place about every year and are normally attended by candidates from around the world.</p>
        <p>My Fordham students take days to process the emotional impact of seeing ''Action,'' saying they could still feel the sound vibrating in their bodies. The following week, Mr. Richards and Mr. Biagini lead a five-hour seminar in Orvieto with the Workcenter company and the students. They discuss what can block an actor from being fully engaged in a performance and how to make deep inner concentration a goal for students who will ultimately be performing before a general audience in a public theater. Mr. Richards, who has lived in Italy for 14 years and is fluent in Italian, exhibits the occasional hesitations of an expatriate whose everyday language is no longer English.</p>
        <p>The students are given an assignment for their last week of training that will involve working with the company. There is a sense of history in the room as Mr. Richards, the heir to Grotowski, continues a theatrical tradition of study that began with the research Stanislavsky conducted at the end of his life and that evolved with Grotowski's own research.</p>
        <p>During the time that I spent with Grotowski in the 10 years before he died, I saw in him the generous nature of a teacher who was continually developing through his work. Conversations would last through the night about, for example, the great work of Stanislavsky. When Grotowski visited the Moscow Art Theater, his hosts sat him down in a small room in front of a large painting of Stanislavsky. The artistic directors then sighed with pleasure and said they felt they now had Stanislavsky with them again.</p>
        <p>Stanislavsky, the founder of the Moscow Art Theater, is considered to have created the vocabulary of modern Western acting. But his research during the five years before he died in 1938 on actors' work with physical actions has not been widely disseminated. Because he needed money, Stanislavsky rushed his books into print in the West. The result was that some of the terms were mistranslated, and the legacy was never fully absorbed in the West.</p>
        <p>Toward the end of his life, Stanislavsky worked at home on his writings, and in his large ballroom he focused with his actors on physical actions. The term was accepted in the Soviet Union at the time because it contained the word physical. Under materialistic Communist ideology, anything psychological or even remotely spiritual was not acceptable.</p>
        <p>As Stanislavsky's work evolved, he grew distant from his earlier emphasis on emotional recall (still prevalent in much American training) because he discovered that in acting, emotions cannot be controlled directly by the will. Instead, he found that creating a physical pattern of various movements -- which he called a score -- is a truer path for actors, allowing them to be spontaneous, to exist in the moment and to unlock a living process onstage.</p>
        <p>Stanislavsky wrote: ''Altogether our art is the art of action. The word 'act' comes from the Latin word 'actus,' which means 'action'; the word 'drama' is of ancient Greek origin also meaning 'action.' ''</p>
        <p>Stanislavsky, in his own way, was also interested in the possibilities of yoga. Sharon M. Carnicke, in her book ''Stanislavsky in Focus,'' quotes from Stanislavsky's writings: ''Having worked wonders in the realms of sub-  and superconsciousness, yogis give much practical advice in these realms. They also approach the unconscious through conscious, preparatory devices, from body to soul, from the real to the unreal, from naturalism to abstraction. And we actors must do the same. A thousand years ago, the Hindus sought exactly the same things we are seeking.''</p>
        <p>Grotowski studied Stanislavsky's work with physical actions when he was a student in Moscow in 1955. And when his Polish Laboratory Theater toured from 1959 to 1969, work was produced that in many people's opinion reached a depth unseen in Western theater.</p>
        <p>This 10-year period established Grotowski, along with Stanislavsky and Vsevolod Meyerhold, as one of the three great theater directors in the last century who also created an acting technique. Grotowski began an investigation into ancient traditional sources that included yoga, Haitian songs and the Bauls -- singer-performers who still survive in Bengal, India, and whose work with vibratory songs of tradition is related to the evolution of an inner life.</p>
        <p>To create a modern theater by understanding and incorporating in a practical way the art of ancient cultures is to operate under a unique set of intentions. And clearly, a theater that intends to impart sacred knowledge differs from one whose aim is to sell tickets. It can thus become difficult to use the term theater as a common reference point when there are such different goals and intentions.</p>
        <p>The phrase ''art as vehicle'' was used by Peter Brook to define the last phase of Grotowski's research. Since the goal of this work is the personal transformation of the individual through the work, Grotowski called the participants ''doers.''</p>
        <p>Both Stanislavsky and Grotowski were true teachers, engaged in the art of theater as a lifelong process of discovery and development. There is a lineage of continuity in the work of a real teacher. The work of an ego-driven guru attracts followers to the guru's personality and charisma and usually a rigidified technique or formula to emulate appears. A teacher guides students to develop their own essential power and creativity. Stanislavsky's work with physical actions is acknowledged by Mr. Richards as being critical to the creation of ''Action.''</p>
        <p>The Workcenter research, like Stanislavsky's, is as important for those who work in the theater as great productions are for a general audience. Each is enriching in its own way. The Greek ideal of maintaining the balance of society through myth, ritual and drama that affect the individual's inner life should always be a goal.</p>
