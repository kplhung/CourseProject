        <p>The 128-member Cadets of Bergen County Drum and Bugle Corps marched onto the field in College Park, Md., last weekend as one of the top 12 corps in the world and marched off as world champions.</p>
        <p>The Cadets, who are based in Bergenfield but draw members from all over the United States and abroad, tied with the Cavaliers of Rosemont, Ill., for the gold medal with scores of 97.65 out of a possible perfect score of 100, said Matt Rosine, a resident of England who is a former Cadet and maintains a Web site for the corps.</p>
        <p>The competition, held in Byrd Stadium in a suburb of Washington, attracted 25,000 people and was the culmination of 45 contests held by the Drum Corps International since June. The Cadets were among 90 junior drum and bugle corps that compete every summer for the top honors. Junior drum corps members have to be 21 or younger. Senior drum corps are made up of marchers over the age of 21.</p>
        <p>Being a member of a drum corps, which includes horns, drums, gongs, xylophones, timpani, chimes and triangles and a color guard of saber spinners, dancers and flag wavers, is a nearly all-consuming occupation. High school and college students who are members gather on weekends to practice starting in November through May with rehearsals often lasting from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. Then they hit the road in June, traveling by bus from contest to contest until the final competition is held to pick the world champion in mid-August.</p>
        <p>A good drum corps, like the Cadets, which have won the championship six other times, will draw members from all over the world to fill out the ranks of the 128 marchers, Mr. Rosine said.</p>
