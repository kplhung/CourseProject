        <p>Peter Decker, the Los Angeles police lieutenant and family man who has always been the soul of calm, compassionate humanity in Faye Kellerman's crime novels, blows his stack in STALKER (Morrow, $25) when his daughter, a rookie on the force, privately takes on one of his investigations and nearly gets herself killed. A colleague's assessment of Cindy Decker -- She's young, she's female, she's smart, and she has a big mouth'' -- doesn't begin to describe the career problems of this imprudent rebel, who alienates half the cops in her department and foolishly keeps it a secret when some unknown enemy starts stalking her.</p>
        <p>As a cop, Cindy should be thrown off the force for stupidity as well as insubordination, but as a literary device, she offers a fresh direction for this long-running series. Besides giving her overprotective father a chance to show some spirit, she injects an unpredictable element into a well-told and complicated story that starts with a wave of daylight carjackings. No sooner does the senior Decker spot a pattern to the thefts, which concern distracted mothers with young children and family-friendly Volvos, than he is stymied by another wave of carjackings involving a red Ferrari, a red Corniche and a red BMW. Although Cindy gets the inside track on these upscale heists, her reckless procedures leave a lot to be desired.</p>

        <p>Loren D. Estleman's 14th Amos Walker mystery, A SMILE ON THE FACE OF THE TIGER (Mysterious Press/Warner, $24.95), is another bravura performance from a master of the hard-shelled private-eye novel, as well as an author's fond tribute to the forgotten heroes of his genre. Estleman's Detroit gumshoe, a serious drinker-thinker who lives by a tough-guy code that went out of fashion with the Edsel, is sick of hearing that he looks as if he just slouched out of a 1950's paperback novel. But when a publisher hires him to find Eugene Booth, a has-been pulp legend who skipped out on a lucrative contract</p>
        <p>to reissue his best book, Walker finds himself staring at a streaky mirror image of himself -- if he lives so long.</p>
        <p>This memorable meeting between Walker and Booth takes place in Cabin 4 of the rustic fishing lodge where the cynical author of pulp classics like ''Tough Town'' and ''Bullets Are My Business'' has fled to write a more honest, and dangerous, book. Before the menacing figure in Cabin 5 makes his inevitable move, these kindred souls offer their boozy respects to the low language and high style of their good old genre. ''We're just two guys talking in the dark,'' Booth says; but in their remarkable exchange, Estleman pays handsome homage to Goodis and Woolrich and all the other ''paper tigers'' to whom he dedicates this wonderful book.</p>
        <p>Clouded thoughts and heavy atmospheric pressures hang over Henning Mankell's international police procedurals, which feature a sternly pensive Swedish detective named Kurt Wallander, who works in Ystad, a southern city on the Baltic Sea where it seems to rain all the time. The bleak climate couldn't be more suitable for THE FIFTH WOMAN (New Press, $24.95), a chilling account of how a civilized nation can unwittingly breed a strain of brutality in its population.</p>
        <p>Wallander is no stranger to murder. But when a harmless bird-watcher and an inoffensive orchid collector are tortured to death, the sheer savagery of the crimes has him flailing for moral ballast. ''The Sweden that was his, the country he had grown up in, that was built after the war, was not as rock-solid as they had thought,'' Mankell writes, in the sober idiom of Steven T. Murray's translation. Unnerved by a growing citizen militia movement and appalled by the role played by Swedish mercenaries in his cases, Wallander immerses himself in this detailed investigation as if the future of his country depended on it. In a way it does, because he takes a global view of crime. If the murder of an old man who wrote poems to birds can be traced to a long-ago political massacre a continent away, then the weight of the world is truly on his back.</p>
        <p>At last, Jane Austen is right where we want her -- in Derbyshire. In JANE AND THE STILLROOM MAID (Bantam, $22.95), Stephanie Barron places her historical heroine at what would become the setting for ''Pride and Prejudice,'' where, as might be expected, her alert mind and quickened sensibilities spring to life. After spending the 1806 social season in stultifying Bath, the lively narrator finally alights in surroundings that take her ladylike breath away -- without diminishing her pretty wit and sharp tongue. Before she can take in the scenic beauty of limestone crags and winding waters, she finds the mutilated corpse of a young maid employed by a local family of aristocrats. Although rumors of witchcraft fly, Jane's acute powers of observation win out over blind superstition, and passion is cooled by reason. For her reward, Jane is privileged to dine at the great ducal seat of Chatsworth, where she feasts on tongue and smugglers' claret and craftily stores away her memories for a later day.</p>
        <p>Bill Pronzini's private detective may be nameless, but he's not rootless. After 25 novels and almost 60 years of life experience, this ''dinosaur,'' as he thinks of himself, has left his big footprints all over the Northern California landscape. In CRAZYBONE (Carroll &amp; Graf, $23), he lumbers down the San Francisco Peninsula to a private enclave of wooded estates and walled country clubs to find out why a grieving widow has refused a $50,000 insurance settlement for the accidental death of her husband. The look of ''raw terror'' on the woman's face when he confronts her -- plus the fact that she immediately bolts town with her 10-year-old daughter -- suggests that she might have something to hide, and the nameless hero does a good job of ferreting out her secret. But the real fun comes from watching the old war horse plod through a hostile social environment, observing the swells at their selfish pursuits and making them regret every condescending sneer they threw in his face.</p>
