        <p>Ulysses S. Grant could have ended up a nobody, but he didn't. A West Point graduate, he served with distinction in the Mexican War but quit the Army in 1854 -- or was drummed out for drunkenness, depending on whom you believe. Afterward, he failed spectacularly as a farmer, as a businessman and as a bill collector. When South Carolina became the first state to secede in 1860, the future general and president was a 38-year-old clerk in his father's leather-goods store in Galena, Ill. In other words, he was a ruined man. And then he led the Union to victory.</p>
        <p>Or so goes the upbeat version of Grant's life. During his lifetime and ever since, critics have cited the carnage at Shiloh in 1862 and pronounced the general a butcher; they've argued that it was almost inevitable that the industrialized North would defeat the sparsely populated South, no matter who was in charge of the Army; and they've viewed Grant's presidency and subsequent financial troubles as evidence of incompetence and navete.</p>
        <p>But a backlash against the backlash is well under way. Recent biographies have shown Grant in a more flattering light. Last year, the Modern Library published a new edition of the ''Personal Memoirs'' Grant wrote near the end of his life to save his wife from penury. There's even a recent business book -- Cigars, Whiskey &amp; Winning: Leadership Lessons from Ulysses S. Grant'' -- that praises his management skills. And now three novels have arrived that depict Grant as an exemplar of timeless values like honor, commitment and diligence.</p>
        <p>Three novels about Ulysses S. Grant? Why the sudden fuss? Well, it may simply be that the public's interest in the Civil War is once again on the rise, to judge from the resurgent debate on the use of the Confederate battle flag. What's more, Grant's presidency bears a passing resemblance to Bill Clinton's; like Clinton, Grant endured a series of scandals during his two terms. And perhaps at the turn of the millennium it's only natural to reflect on a leader whose career spanned an era that was, in some ways, more tumultuous than our own.</p>
        <p>The simplest of these novels is ''That Fateful Lightning,'' a dramatization of Grant's progress in the field during the Civil War and, later, his struggle to complete his memoirs as his throat cancer worsened. Richard Parry does a credible job of depicting the complex tactical decisions that confronted the general, and here and there you sense the anguish that the historical Grant must have felt about what he put his family through. As Grant fights his cancer, he asks his wife, ''Where did our life go, Julia? I seem to have frittered it away.'' But that's about as poignant as it gets. Parry has also written three novels about Wyatt Earp, and perhaps his style wears better in a western; most of the dialogue here sounds stilted, and the characters are cardboard. Parry has obviously done his research for this novel, and too much of it shows. Little factoids about Grant pop up at all the wrong times.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Ev Ehrlich gives himself more room to tinker with the facts, to clown around. His ''Grant Speaks'' pretends to be a first draft of Grant's memoirs, and it does follow the basic outlines of the historical record. There's one big gimmick, however. In reality, the general was born Hiram Ulysses Grant and acquired the nickname ''Useless''; he became Ulysses Simpson Grant (Simpson was his mother's maiden name) through a bureaucratic error. In his novel, Ehrlich stirs things up by inventing a real Ulysses Grant, nicknamed ''Useful,'' who lives in the same Ohio town as the awkward Hiram.</p>
        <p>Polished and privileged, Useful wins a spot at West Point but runs away after losing his memory in an accident. So Hiram takes over where the amnesiac leaves off. As a young soldier in Mexico, Grant comes face to face with destiny while tripped out on peyote. A robed horseman named Mescalito appears and prophesies, ''Ulysses Grant will lead great masses of men in the glorious cause of their human redemption.'' But Grant spends the rest of his life wondering whom Mescalito meant, because Useful, who never regains his memory, keeps showing up to remind Useless of his shortcomings. Grant's Civil War victories reassure him that Mescalito's prophecy was meant for him, but the economic crises and corruption scandals that plagued his presidency only amplify his doubts. Ehrlich is an economist by training, and he spent four years as undersecretary of commerce in the Clinton administration. But there's nothing bureaucratic about his populist streak or his prose style, which is breezy and almost effortless. Ehrlich writes about his subject with affection and admiration, and he gives his imagination free rein.</p>
        <p>Max Byrd's ''Grant,'' by contrast, is a much more serious, intricate novel. Apart from the numerous flashbacks to the Civil War, nearly all the action happens in the 1880's, when the effects of the war are finally starting to come into focus. ''There was a great story waiting for someone to tell it,'' Byrd writes, ''not about the war, but about the reborn nation, on the other side of the war.''</p>
        <p>Byrd tells that story not through Grant's eyes but through those of Sylvanus Cadwallader, an actual friend of Grant's during the Civil War, and those of an invented journalist named Nicholas Trist, a Union veteran who lost an arm while fighting under Grant's command. (Trist has returned from France to cover Grant's campaign for a third presidential term.) These days, it's hard to conceive of a party convention where the final result is uncertain, but Byrd offers a gripping account of one where it was. In the end, Grant's old slogans -- He hails from Appomattox'' -- turn out not to work anymore, and he can't get enough delegates to secure the Republican nomination. For the first half of the novel Byrd leaves the impression that Grant's best days are long past. But naturally, the general turns out to have some fight left in him. His investment firm goes bankrupt because of a partner's treachery, and his fortune disappears with it. So Grant begins writing to earn a living for his family. He secures a book contract for his memoirs with Mark Twain's publishing company. And even as his health deteriorates, Grant will not be dissuaded from his work. ''I mean you shall have this book,'' Grant tells Twain. The general is earnest and determined to the end.</p>
        <p>Of course, novels usually turn on impulses that are far more baroque than these, and Byrd adroitly deploys a small ensemble of Washington socialites, journalists and politicians to provide the sins and petty cruelties that push ''Grant'' along. Henry Adams, who in real life viewed Grant as ''pre-intellectual'' and ''simple-minded,'' appears here as ''a little engine of patrician self-amusement'' who is all but blind to his wife's artistic talents. Byrd builds his characters with a remarkable accretion of details -- down to the speed of Clover Adams's hands as they sweep along crowded bookshelves, the quality of her handwriting, the white tissue paper she uses to wrap each of her photographs. The author of novels about Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson, Byrd is an expert at linking the products of his own imagination with historical facts. The fictitious Trist has an affair with a real Pennsylvania senator's wife who was known to get around. All these machinations produce a couple of different results: They make an appealing tale about love and death in late 19th-century America, and they flatter the sturdy, homely general by comparison.</p>
        <p>For somebody who grew up with the nickname ''Useless,'' Grant was astonishingly successful. In Byrd's book, the Twain character holds Grant up as an example of ''what he called the 'self-invented' man, that strange American ability to be two completely different people in one lifetime.'' Twain adds that ''in the fiery crucible of battle Grant had actually created a whole new self -- a second nature.'' In an author's note, Ehrlich describes his novel as an attempt to understand ''what it means to have a destiny and to be an American.'' What it means, these three books suggest, is that you can remake and redeem yourself again and again. As you read these novels, you can't help marveling at how a single life can accommodate such extremes of accomplishment and failure -- and how suddenly one turns into the other.</p>
