        <p>An article last Sunday about the career paths of former executives of Drexel Burnham Lambert referred incorrectly to the Milken Institute, where Michael R. Milken, former head of Drexel's junk-bond unit in Los Angeles, is chairman. The institute is an economic research organization; it is not involved in charities. The Milken Family Foundation, which had Mr. Milken as a co-founder in 1982, is a private charitable organization that supports education and medical research; Cap Cure, founded by him in 1993, is a public charity that supports prostate cancer research.</p>
