        <p>SPORTY coupes come and go, but BMW's 3-Series reigns supreme, deftly deflecting all challengers to its throne. Now Acura has stepped up, drawn a bull's-eye on the Bimmer and taken aim.</p>
        <p>Acura's 3.2 CL, once a slightly fancier, more eccentrically styled version of the Honda Accord coupe, has been redone for 2001 with more style, size and substance. More important, it now has enough of a sporty edge, especially the Type S version, to make a direct challenge to two-door models in BMW's 3-Series.</p>
        <p>My Type S test car had a 3.2-liter V-6 specially tuned to deliver 260 horsepower -- 67 more than the 2000-model BMW 328Ci and 35 more than its 2001-model replacement, the 330Ci. Peak torque of the front-drive Acura is 232 foot-pounds, compared with 214 foot-pounds for the '01 BMW. (The regular 3.2 CL, with a milder version of the same engine, has 225 horsepower.)</p>
        <p>The second-generation CL is longer, wider, taller and heavier than the 3-Series. Compared with the BMW, it has 5 more cubic feet of cabin space, plus 4 more cubic feet in the trunk.</p>
        <p>At the racetrack, the two cars run about even, at just under 7 seconds in 0-to-60 acceleration tests by enthusiast magazines. But the 328Ci -- with rear-wheel drive and a perfect front-to-rear balance of weight -- performed better in handling tests.</p>
        <p>In the battle of the window stickers, Acura has the edge. The '02 330Ci starts at $35,560, including the delivery charge and standard features like antilock brakes, traction and stability control, four air bags and an inflatable head-protection pillow. But that is just the beginning. For $2,900, a premium package includes leather upholstery, power sunroof and other items. Add $1,275 for an automatic transmission, $475 for metallic paint, $500 for heated front seats, $500 for xenon headlamps and $675 for an upgraded Harman-Kardon stereo. Cars at dealerships often wear pricetags of $40,000 or more.</p>
        <p>Compare that with Acura's simplified pricing: $28,460 for the base model and $30,810 for the Type S. A $2,000 navigation system is the only option. Everything else is standard: the traction and stability systems; a five-speed automatic transmission that can be shifted manually; heated power seats with leather trim; xenon headlamps; power sunroof; high-performance tires; and sensors that adjust the air bags' deployment based on the speed of a crash and whether occupants are wearing safety belts.</p>
        <p>Acura's navigation system, already one of the best, now has a six-inch color touch-screen and a DVD data base that maps the entire country on one disk, with more than 3.7 million suggestions for restaurants, gas stations and points of interest.</p>
        <p>The numbers tell only part of the story, of course. No matter how quickly the Acura accelerates or how sporty it feels, purists will object to its front-drive design and lack of a stick shift.</p>
        <p>While the CL does not outshine the BMW on a racetrack, it handles curves on real roads swiftly and confidently. It moves quickly but smoothly away from stoplights and excels at high-speed cruising. Gear changes are nearly imperceptible. The steering is quick -- so quick that it reminded me of the lightning-fast reflexes of Honda's S2000 sports car.</p>
        <p>While the CL's rigid chassis keeps interior noise low, the growl of the engine can still be heard. With its firm suspension settings, the Type S may ride too harshly for Americans accustomed to luxury cars; my companion wanted to feel more isolated from the road. But I found the ride comfortable, and I liked the messages I got through the wheel from the pavement. The CL strikes a nice balance between luxury ride and high-performance handling, especially on Michigan's rough roads.</p>
        <p>The CL's styling evolved from a sharply creased design study, though the look has been toned down for the production car. The test model, in a shade of orange that Acura calls Sundance gold, certainly stood out.</p>
        <p>Inside, the Type S was dressed in tasteful black and gray with elegant gathered leather upholstery on the seats and doors. The interior had its quirks, too; instead of wood, the test car had black and gray plastic trim that looked like slate. I'm still not sure if I liked it.</p>
        <p>There are many nice touches. The controls are laid out logically, as they always are in cars from the Honda family. The front seats move forward automatically for entry to the rear, which is roomier than most coupes'. I found the seats to be extremely comfortable, by far the best ever from Honda. Thick side bolsters hold you in place on hard turns.</p>
        <p>The Ohio-built 3.2 CL is not a Bimmer, and it won't win over BMW's hard-core loyalists. But it is a far better car, in every respect, than the first-generation CL. And judged on its own merits, it is an impressive package at a fair price, a Japanese David with a powerful slingshot and a pretty good bead on Goliath.</p>
