        <p>The federal government has come forward with a way to enable schoolteachers to buy a house at a bargain price -- if it's in the right place.</p>
        <p>The place has to a neighborhood that the government defines as economically distressed. The Department of Housing and Urban Development has no shortage of houses that it has acquired in those areas through mortgage defaults. Through its Teacher Next Door program, it is now offering them to teachers through a bidding process at 50 percent of the appraised value.</p>
        <p>If the buyer chooses to obtain financing through HUD, only $100 in cash is needed for the down payment, and closing costs are paid through the mortgage. Teachers normally have to work in the school district where the house is purchased, but New York City is an exception. Under the program it is considered one school district.</p>
        <p>The HUD regional office said that there are 53 qualifying areas in New York City, and about 50 in surrounding counties. The sales in these communities came to about 45 houses over the last eight months.</p>
        <p>The program is similar to another called Officer Next Door, which does for police officers what HUD is now trying to do for teachers.</p>
        <p>For more information, call (800) 217-6970, or go to the Web sites www.hud.gov/teacher or www.firstpreston.com, where information about the houses is available.</p>
