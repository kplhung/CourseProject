        <p>I SPENT some time last week saying goodbye to the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden at the Museum of Modern Art, at 11 West 53rd Street. One hot, sticky afternoon, I set my chair near the jets in the rectangular pool, to catch the breeze coming off the water, and to commune with my favorite sculpture there: Maillol's ''River,'' the Olympian-size nude  lying by the water's edge, head almost touching its surface.</p>
        <p>The next evening, I sat at a table on the balcony of Sette, the restaurant that overlooks the garden, watching birds flying in and out of the arching branches of the weeping beeches. Wisps of clouds floated over the mansard roofs on 54th Street, their patterns uncannily mimicked by the white swirls in the marbled floor below.</p>

        <p>I SPENT some time last week saying goodbye to the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden at the Museum of Modern Art, at 11 West 53rd Street. One hot, sticky afternoon, I set my chair near the jets in the rectangular pool, to catch the breeze coming off the water, and to commune with my favorite sculpture there: Maillol's ''River,'' the Olympian-size nude  lying by the water's edge, head almost touching its surface.</p>
        <p>The next evening, I sat at a table on the balcony of Sette, the restaurant that overlooks the garden, watching birds flying in and out of the arching branches of the weeping beeches. Wisps of clouds floated over the mansard roofs on 54th Street, their patterns uncannily mimicked by the white swirls in the marbled floor below.</p>
        <p>The next day, it rained, and the beeches looked somber through the glass wall of the museum lobby. Mysterious, like women bending thick heads of hair to the ground.</p>
        <p>This garden has as many moments as the weather, and the sculptures that continuously rotate through its fluid spaces. One day Giacometti's ''Spoon Woman,'' another, Alfred Munkenbeck's walls of woven steel. And each one changes the space.</p>
        <p>But it wasn't just a gallery, it was a stage for live shows: speeches, juggling, jazz and 20th-century chamber music. Sonny Rollins, the Supremes, Jefferson Airplane performed here. John Gielgud declaimed Shakespeare under Buckminster Fuller's dome. Salvador Dali recreated his  ''Rainy Taxi,'' complete with mannequins and snails.</p>
        <p>One of New York's most exquisite spaces will close tomorrow and remain so for more than four years. Or as long as it takes to complete the museum's $650 million expansion and renovation, by the architect Yoshio Taniguchi.</p>
        <p>The garden will become a staging area for construction, and it too will be renovated.</p>
        <p>''The garden needs a full restoration,'' said Glenn D. Lowry, the museum director. ''The pavers are broken and chipped, and the garden was never put down on a proper foundation. It was put on the rubble of the buildings that were here before it.''</p>
        <p>David Rockefeller recalled: ''We gave the house on 53rd Street to the museum, and the land on 54th Street. I grew up in that house, and we used to ice-skate back there in the winter, when it was flooded.''</p>
        <p>His father, John D. Rockefeller Jr., had first leased the house to the museum in 1932, three years after it was founded by his wife, Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, and others to promote modern art. In 1937, when a new building was constructed on the site, she asked that a sculpture garden be included.</p>
        <p>The first garden, designed by Alfred H. Barr, the museum's founding director, and its curator of architecture, John McAndrew, reflected the minimalist approach and asymmetrical composition of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. It was as sharp a departure from the treatment of outdoor sculpture as the museum was from the status quo of the art world. Philip Johnson's redesign in 1953 made the garden a kind of dance with shifting planes, walls, water, glass and marble.</p>
        <p>''Both gardens were truly radical innovations in the display of modern sculpture,'' said Mirka Benes, an associate professor of the history of landscape architecture at Harvard University. European curators of modern art had proposed displaying modern sculpture outdoors. ''But what made the MOMA gardens so unique is that they were designed as configurations of walls, pavements, sculptures, in which vertical and horizontal elements and free-standing sculptures all played crucial parts in the balance of the overall composition: move something, and the configuration of the whole changes.''</p>
        <p>These gardens were designed for changing exhibitions in the same outdoor space, ''rather than simply placing sculpture outside in a fairground or a temporary lot,'' Ms. Benes said.</p>
        <p>''MOMA's gardens thus truly invented a genre,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Like the courtyard in Philip Johnson's first glass house in Cambridge, built while he was a student at Harvard, the garden is seen from the ''living room'' of the museum lobby, through a floor-to-ceiling glass wall.</p>
        <p>In the 1953 redesign, accomplished with the landscape architect James Fanning, ''What I wanted was to get a sense of being in the city but still being far, far, away in different parts of the garden,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''That line waved in and out, depending on where you were. And trees were a very great part of the grammar.''</p>
        <p>Originally, tall Japanese cedars formed the irregular, dark green screen that separated one viewing area from another, tempting visitors to see what lay on the other side. When the cedars declined, they were replaced by two weeping beeches, now  so inseparable from this composition of marble and water. It wasn't their fault, but the beeches grew too big to be art.</p>
        <p>Now those trees, along with the graceful birches, the overgrown London planes and the fat linden trees that have long shaded the western terrace, will be moved to nurseries and other gardens. And younger trees will be planted.</p>
        <p>''It's healthy every 30 or 40 years to renew the planting,'' Mr. Lowry said. ''Philip Johnson designed the garden to not be so densely foliated.''</p>
        <p>Peter Reed, associate curator of the department of architecture and design, said, ''It really is an outdoor room, where the ceiling is the sky.'' As a student, visiting from Philadelphia, he loved the Matisse ''Backs'' -- four bronze sculptures, increasingly abstract, of a woman's back -- which for years were attached to the north wall.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reed noted the grand procession of installations over the years, from the Japanese house in 1954-55 -- which illustrated, by its very rocks and water, its simple geometry, the roots of modern architecture -- to the car shows, to Piotr Uklanski's illuminated dance floor and to Shigeru Ban's cardboard arch, installed this spring.</p>
        <p>It's easy to forget that the garden's architecture has also changed. Remember the  wide second-story terrace on the east side of the garden, where one could see more sculpture, and view the garden below?</p>
        <p>''It had a grand Venetian stairway,'' Mr. Reed said. ''I liked how Philip treated stairs,  and the path. Turning the corner and seeing a sculpture, like 'The River.' He was great about that. The drama.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Reed is going to miss going up the escalator and looking down on a mass of red tulips. But in a few years, he said, the views will be even better. The escalator will be gone, freeing up that great glass wall once again to light and greenery. Another glass wall, seven stories high, with an entrance to the garden, will face its west side. So that inside-outside feel will be even more palpable than when the garden opened in 1939.</p>
        <p>And where will people go to make their own art, to dream, to fall in love?</p>
        <p>''Cassavetes's first film, 'Shadows,' was shot there,'' said Laurence Kardish, the museum's curator of film and video.  ''Woody Allen always had a fondness for our garden. And the avant-garde filmmaker Ken Jacobs said that before he met his present wife, this is where he would go to see beautiful women. But he tried to avoid the garden, because it distracted him from the art in the building.''</p>
