        <p>JUDGING by recent restaurant openings in the state, 2000 may be morphing into a year of celebrating Spanish cuisine. The newest arrival is Mecca in Norwalk. While the name evokes Arabia, most of Mecca's dishes are Spanish with a Mediterranean accent. The Ecuador ean owner and chef, Jaime Lopez, was formerly a chef at Meson Galicia (just around the corner) and at the Mediterranean Grill in Wilton. Several dishes on the short menu, in fact, seem borrowed from the Me son/Med Grill repertory.</p>
        <p>Oxtail croquettes, four well-browned breaded pillows, aromatic with oxtail, carrots and other vegetables in a demi-glaze, resonated familiarity. They were as robustly delicious here as in those other locales.</p>

        <p>JUDGING by recent restaurant openings in the state, 2000 may be morphing into a year of celebrating Spanish cuisine. The newest arrival is Mecca in Norwalk. While the name evokes Arabia, most of Mecca's dishes are Spanish with a Mediterranean accent. The Ecuador ean owner and chef, Jaime Lopez, was formerly a chef at Meson Galicia (just around the corner) and at the Mediterranean Grill in Wilton. Several dishes on the short menu, in fact, seem borrowed from the Me son/Med Grill repertory.</p>
        <p>Oxtail croquettes, four well-browned breaded pillows, aromatic with oxtail, carrots and other vegetables in a demi-glaze, resonated familiarity. They were as robustly delicious here as in those other locales.</p>
        <p>Mecca's octopus tarrina was probably the very best rendering of this cephalopod we have ever enjoyed. Tenderized in extra-virgin olive oil and sprinkled with paprika and sea salt, the little creatures were sauteed with potato and eggplant, making a felicitous and memorable combination.</p>
        <p>Several other starters also pleased us. Stuffed marinated salmon with a goat cheese mousse and carrot-cider vinaigrette was as original as it was prettily served. Farm-raised mussels, sauteed in olive oil with garlic, tomato and basil, provided a sauce delectable enough to mop up with bits of the very good rolls served. Peppers escabeche -- sweet red pi quillo Spanish peppers stuffed with marinated salmon and seabass, served at room temperature -- had a subtly satisfying pickly pucker.</p>
        <p>If pressed to cite a favorite among more than a few standout entrees, we would probably say the sauteed sweetbreads, buffed to a golden brown, resting on spinach atop a bed of buttery rice, with a smidgen of fresh coulis of chopped tomatoes and basil.</p>
        <p>Seafood risotto looked like a food magazine photo shoot: herb-infused Arborio rice, studded with shrimp and squid and a few bay scallops, was framed by a border that alternated mussels and cockles in their shells. Eye appeal was only the beginning. The various sea creatures were fresh and juicy and the rice expertly seasoned, moist but not mushy.</p>
        <p>Marinated loin of pork was roasted to a delicate pink stage, then served in a sun-dried cherry sauce that was sweetly piquant, but not overbearing. Delicious pureed sweet potatoes and spinach punctuated the dish.</p>
        <p>Roasted free-range chicken, another high point, wore crisp, well-burnished skin over moist, tender, well-seasoned thigh and breast meat. It was further enhanced by a generous helping of sauteed Arborio rice stippled with wild mushrooms and a savory herb garlic sauce.</p>
        <p>Only ragout of baby leg of lamb, supposedly with Moroccan spices, almonds and yogurt, failed to live up to our expectations, as most of the tempting accessories were absent. What we were served was a piping hot earthenware casserole full of pieces of lamb in a top-heavy curry sauce, more reminiscent of India than of Morocco. The lamb was palatable enough, but it was not what we anticipated.</p>
        <p>Desserts rarely trump a good Spanish meal, but Mecca's flan was exquisite, smooth and custardy with candied zest on top and enveloped in the light caramel sauce. Rum cake with vanilla cream layers and a dollop of creme anglaise was sweet- tooth rewarding, but not exceptional. A lighter, more pleasing choice was lemon pie, with a buttery graham cracker crust and thin blanket of Italian meringue. Creme brulee was creamily rich, but the blowtorch caramelizing of the sugar seal made it ultra thick and overly sweet.</p>
        <p>Dinner for two, three courses apiece, came to $63, before tax, tip and drinks. Considering the quality of the food and its careful, pretty but not flashy presentation, this represented good value. The brief, mostly Spanish, wine list begins at $19.75. A light Albarino, a little-known Galician white wine, for example, married well with seafood offerings.</p>
