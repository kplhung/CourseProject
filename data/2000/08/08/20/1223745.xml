        <p>More than anything else, Joseph La Rose believed in women's shoes. For nearly 70 years, he devoted his life to pumps and wedges, flats and sandals.

Dresses and coats and even handbags were interesting only insofar as they mirrored and complemented the greatness of a La Rose shoe.

        <p>More than anything else, Joseph La Rose believed in women's shoes. For nearly 70 years, he devoted his life to pumps and wedges, flats and sandals. La Rose's brain translated anything beautiful -- a stained-glass window, the view from a plane, a flowering jacaranda tree -- into shoes. Dresses and coats and even handbags were interesting only insofar as they mirrored and complemented the greatness of a La Rose shoe. His eye was focused on footwear, and when he died of cancer at 88 last December, he was survived by his wife, Trudy, and more than 100,000 pairs of shoes, which were stockpiled at his store in Jacksonville, Fla.</p>
        <p>''Joe never believed in sales,'' recalled Trudy, whose La Rose-designed shoe, the Trudi, has a big orange patent-leather camellia on the front and a round brass heel that is fluted like an Ionic column. ''Customers would ask, 'When will the sale be?' But there were no sales. Joe thought his shoes were too beautiful to be sold at a discount. He wouldn't even sell shoes to a customer if he didn't think it was right. He'd say, 'These shoes don't suit your personality.' And he wouldn't budge.''</p>
        <p>Although Joseph La Rose is not well known outside the South, he once had five stores in Florida and catered to an elite clientele. ''His shoes were expensive,'' explained Radford Brown, who with Cesar Padilla owns Cherry, a vintage store in Manhattan, and bought the La Rose shoe kingdom. Brown grew up in Jacksonville, and his mother and sisters dreamed of buying La Rose shoes. ''There were no great shoe stores between Miami and Atlanta, and a lot of women would do their shopping in Jacksonville,'' Brown recalled. ''A La Rose shoe wasn't like a regular shoe. A La Rose shoe was, somehow, a fantasy.''</p>
        <p>The shoes always had that certain something extra: a bow, some rhinestones, a cameo. A La Rose was meant to conjure up visions of a more exotic, more intoxicating world, and he named the shoes accordingly: the Cara, a blue sandal covered in charms that speaks of midnight dances; the da Vinci, a pump with tiny pieces of snakeskin stitched together for seduction; the Miami, a studded orange and green sandal that screams sunny days; the Texas, an ornately jeweled slip-on perfect for a barbecue by the pool. It's hard not to look at the Gigi (a paisley-print sling-back) or the Villager (a red, white and blue patent loafer) and not envision an accompanying life. Even with a simple outfit, La Rose shoes create an irresistible mood.</p>
        <p>During his heyday in the 1960's and early 70's, La Rose regularly sold shoes to such disparate types as Abigail Van Buren (''Dear Abby''), Joan Crawford and Jayne Mansfield, who was wearing a pair of La Rose boots when she was killed in an automobile accident in 1967. ''Shoes are like theater, and I try to give my customers a good show,'' La Rose once said, explaining why his shoes appealed to movie stars. Crawford, in particular, was a devoted, if prickly, customer. According to her correspondence with La Rose, she seemed to favor gold and black shoes, and she once drew a rather clumsy outline of her feet, complaining, ''I don't understand why the shoes can't be made, using the pattern as a sample.''</p>
        <p>''The story goes that Jackie Kennedy once came into La Rose,'' said Padilla, sitting in what was La Rose's store, a fascinating hodgepodge of modernism and kitsch. There are shoes displayed in rococo fountains, shoes on the keys of a player piano, shoes perched in gold frames, shoes on racks, shoes on top of shoes. The store is a time warp: a Day-Glo 70's platform is side by side with a Shantung silk Sabrina pump from the late 50's.</p>
        <p>''John Kennedy was speaking in Hemming Plaza,'' Padilla continued, ''and that was near one of the La Rose stores, and Jackie came by. It isn't clear whether she bought anything, but La Rose sent her shoes in the White House. He also sent shoes to Caroline.'' Padilla picked up a clunky late-60's shoe, made of black and green patent leather covered with small metal spikes that jutted out at strange angles. ''These are my favorite shoes in the whole store,'' Padilla said. ''I wonder if he sent these to Jackie.''</p>
        <p>It's unlikely. Even as a child, La Rose was an astute shoe matchmaker. His family arrived from Sicily when he was 10 and settled in the Midwest. ''Joe joined a kind of burlesque show,'' recalled Trudy, who met her husband in Rockford, Ill. ''He was in shoes by the time we met. I became his shoe model. He always wanted to work in shoes.''</p>
        <p>La Rose took jobs working in a series of shoe departments in specialty stores, winding up in a high-end Jacksonville shop called Purcells. In 1949, at 38, he opened his first store, in Jacksonville, which was an immediate success. His most popular shoe was an elfin-looking flat with an ankle strap, which he named the Yippy Skippy. In one year, La Rose sold 5,000 pairs of the Yippy Skippy in 23 colors of velvet, leather or suede. ''It was a steady seller for years,'' Trudy said. ''And you could put a jewel on it and fall in love with the shoe all over again.''</p>
        <p>The Yippy Skippy now resides, neatly boxed, in a multitude of sizes and shades, at the top of a rickety staircase high above the La Rose boutique. When his stores closed, one by one, La Rose moved all his stock there. By 1981, he'd filled the 7,000 square feet with an enormous collection of decade-spanning shoes -- 12 small rooms all organized by color, with shoes stacked 50 deep.</p>
        <p>Up in the La Rose shoe attic, it's like catacombs, with shoe boxes as crypts. One room is filled with silver sequin shoes, the next with gold lame. One room is all purple, and then, behind a door, are boxes upon boxes of Kelly green and blue suede two-tone spectators with every sort of heel, from fat to thin. There's a brocade section and an entire room devoted to florals. Stuck in one closet is a cache of a hundred matching purses, including some classic, never-used bags that Bonnie Cashin designed for Coach in the mid-60's. It's overwhelming.</p>
        <p>Brown, who was on a stepladder searching for a particular pink ostrich pump, held up a shoe that was covered in iridescent feathers. ''The ad copy for this one read, 'We want you to feel you're on an African safari and La Rose is the guide,''' he said. ''It's so beautiful.''</p>
        <p>Padilla and Brown have been selling off some of the La Rose stock to locals in Jacksonville, and many prominent American designers, from Donna Karan to Marc Jacobs, have sent a representative down south to have a look. Jacobs was entranced by a suede flat with a large safety pin stuck through the front, and Karan bought a wide range of shoes. At the end of the year, Sotheby's is planning to auction off 100 lots of La Rose shoes, complete with matching handbags and original design sketches by La Rose. ''I'm not certain what we're going to do with the rest of the stock,'' Padilla said. ''We might have to open another store just for the shoes.''</p>
        <p>That would have pleased La Rose. Near the end of his life, he and his wife let their employees go, and they worked in the store alone. ''It got to the point where no one could find anything,'' Trudy explained. ''But we knew where everything was. Joe would take 10 or 15 minutes to find something, but he always made the perfect choice. He loved the store. He never wanted to go home. We never took vacations; how could we? We had to run the store. We would even have our holidays there. Thanksgiving with the shoes.''</p>
        <p>Trudy, who is petite and pretty and now lives in an assisted-care home, has not been back to the store since her husband's death. She looked lost, as if her identity had been stripped. ''We were very happy as we were,'' she said. ''We had a house, but the store was like our home.'' She smiled. ''I loved shoes, until the end. Then I got very sick of shoes. But not Joe. Joe always loved the shoes.'' She looked down at her feet. She was wearing white tennis shoes. ''Joe would hate these shoes,'' she said, shaking her head. ''He'd want to put a flower on them.''</p>
