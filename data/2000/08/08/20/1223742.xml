        <p>Artist Helen Marden has furnished living room of her Manhattan town house with artifacts of her extensive travels; photo (special section, Fashions of The Times) (part 2 of 2-part section) (S)</p>

        <p>For some people, home is where the heart is. For Helen Marden, home is where the heart has been. Marden, a painter, mother of two and the wife of the artist Brice Marden, has been hitting the road regularly since she made a trip to Morocco after college. ''Traveling alone is one of the great pleasures in life,'' said Marden, who has also traveled extensively with her family. And the living room of the Mardens' Manhattan town house -- she calls it ''my cave'' -- has become a richly illustrated album of those journeys. Though the room contains furniture ranging from early American to Eames, and art by Franz Kline, Richard Tuttle and Marden herself, it mostly reflects Marden's longtime fascination with India. ''I could go there every year, and I'd be happy,'' she said. ''It's so ancient and it's so sensual.'' So it would seem, from the room's profusion of sinuously sculptured deities, sexually explicit Tantric paintings and ritual phallic symbols. But what is really seductive about the room is its evocation of a life well lived.</p>
