        <p>VICE presidential candidates, like the Perseid meteor shower, briefly light up midsummer skies. Usually, that's as long as they matter because people vote for presidents, not vice presidents.</p>
        <p>With the election 79 days away, Dick Cheney, a former congressman and defense secretary, and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut have already  done just about everything running mates can do for their tickets, from reflecting well on the presidential candidates who chose them to providing a lift for their national conventions.</p>
        <p>But those contributions have been significant. Mr. Cheney and Mr. Lieberman were serious choices, men voters can imagine as president, and displayed Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Vice President Al Gore in a ''presidential'' manner, making a critical big decision in a serious way.</p>
        <p>Neither man was a crassly political choice, someone selected simply to carry a big state, as Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania would have been for Mr. Bush, or Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois for Mr. Gore. Wyoming's three electoral votes were safe for Mr. Bush before he picked its former congressman; Connecticut's eight were almost as solidly secure for Mr. Gore before he chose its junior senator.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's choice of his father's secretary of defense for a running mate was ''safe and responsible,'' said Stephen Wayne, a Georgetown University political scientist. ''It basically gave us an indication that if George W. Bush is elected, he will be a president who uses advisers in making decisions.'' Or, as a more caustic academic student of presidential elections, Nelson W. Polsby of the University of California at Berkeley, put it, ''Cheney was picked to indemnify Bush against the charge that he was ignorant.''</p>
        <p>The selection of Senator Lieberman, the first Jew on a national ticket, was more dramatic. As Professor Wayne put it, ''the choice was unexpected and courageous'' -- words not usually associated with Mr. Gore. Bob Shrum, a key Gore strategist, said, ''People began taking a fresh look at Al Gore through his choice of Joe Lieberman.'' And he brought something else through his aura of incorruptibility and moral outrage against President Clinton's dalliance with a White House intern. As Professor Polsby observed, ''Lieberman was picked to indemnify Gore against the charge that he was sleazy.''</p>
        <p>And each fulfilled the other main duty of a vice presidential choice. Each dominated public attention for several days, keeping the other side out of the news and presumably out of voter's minds.</p>
        <p>That was especially important for Mr. Gore, whose staff leaked the Lieberman choice on the Monday after the Republican convention -- stopping Mr. Bush's momentum cold. ''The Gore campaign had been in the doldrums,'' Professor Wayne said. ''If Gore wins the election, we'll say this was the beginning, the jump start.''</p>
        <p>The publicity for Mr. Cheney was overwhelmingly positive, but included some negative recollections of his voting record, including his votes against banning ''cop killer'' bullets that penetrate policemen's Kevlar vests. Mr. Cheney also voted against a resolution urging freedom for Nelson Mandela, who was then imprisoned.</p>
        <p>The attention focused on Mr. Lieberman was even more upbeat. No one attacked him -- perhaps for fear of sounding anti-Semitic -- except for a few blacks who were largely silenced by reminders from Representative John Lewis and the Rev. Jesse Jackson that Mr. Lieberman had marched with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Some of his more conservative votes, like experiments with school vouchers, were instantly and publicly forgiven on the assurance that Mr. Gore, not Mr. Lieberman, would make policy.</p>
        <p>Of course, it is not a certainty that Mr. Cheney or Mr. Lieberman will have no continuing influence on this election. But take the most obvious possibility -- Mr. Lieberman's religion. Jews already vote heavily, and heavily Democratic. So Mr. Lieberman is not likely to change their direct impact on the vote the way John F. Kennedy brought Catholics back to their Democratic roots. He might cost his ticket votes because of his religion or gain votes from people who concluded that opposition to him was unworthy.</p>
        <p>But neither effect is likely to be large.</p>
        <p>That was not always true. Geographic balance meant more when the country's regions were more distinct, and plainly Lyndon B. Johnson carried Texas for John F. Kennedy in 1960. Mr. Shrum thinks Bill Clinton's choice of Mr. Gore in 1992 had a lasting effect, helping eke out some narrow victories in Southern states and reinforcing a message of youth and change.</p>
        <p>Sometimes vice presidential nominations were necessary investments just to get a nomination. Franklin D. Roosevelt won over Texas delegates in 1932 with a promise to make John Nance Garner his vice president.</p>
        <p>AND sometimes vice presidential candidates hurt a ticket by creating a distraction or embarrassment. It is hard to imagine this year's buttoned-down, dare-to-be-cautious vice presidential duo committing a gaffe like Henry Cabot Lodge's 1960 promise that as president, Richard M. Nixon would appoint a black to the Cabinet, an offer that could have cost votes in the South.</p>
        <p>More often the distractions have developed from a disclosure of hitherto unexamined parts of the candidate's past, like the secret sources of Mr. Nixon's finances in 1952, Thomas Eagleton's electroshock therapy in 1972, Geraldine Ferraro's husband's murky business ties in 1984 and Dan Quayle's avoidance of the draft in 1988. And none of those embarrassments were decisive in those elections.</p>
        <p>Indeed, in most elections, vice presidential nominees embody the enduring truth of the following observation by Thomas Marshall, Woodrow Wilson's vice president: ''Once there were two brothers: one ran away to sea, the other was elected vice president -- and nothing was ever heard from either of them again.''</p>
