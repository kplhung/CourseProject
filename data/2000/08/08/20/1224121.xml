        <p>One major title was won here Friday night at the American Contract Bridge League's Summer Nationals, but another remained to be decided.</p>
        <p>An experienced group consisting of Kathie Wei-Sender of Nashville; Betty Ann Kennedy of Shreveport, La.; Juanita Chambers of Walpole, Mass.; Jill Levin of Riverdale, N.Y.; Janice Seamon-Molson of Miami; and Tobi Sokolow of Austin, Tex., won the Women's Knockout Team Championship. They began strongly in the final and held on to win by 44 imps against a Texas team that will represent the United States in Maastricht, the Netherlands, in a week. In the quarterfinal stage of the prestigious Spingold Knockout Teams on Friday, a giant-killing group continued strongly. Roy Welland and Brad Moss, both of Manhattan, Marc Jacobus of Las Vegas, Fred Gitelman of Toronto, and Magnus Lindkvist and Peter Fredin of Sweden won by 74 against a team headed by Richard Schwartz of East Elmhurst, N.Y.</p>

        <p>Another match was also one-sided. George Jacobs of Hinsdale, Ill., with a team including four Italian stars, won by 112 against Grant Baze of La Jolla, Calif., and his squad.</p>
        <p>The other two matches were in doubt until the end. Rose Meltzer of Los Gatos, Calif., and her team trailed by 15 with two deals remaining, but snatched a victory by 5 against Rita Shugart of Pebble Beach, Calif., and her foursome. Steve Robinson of Arlington, Va., and his team won by 7 against the group led by James Cayne of Manhattan.</p>
