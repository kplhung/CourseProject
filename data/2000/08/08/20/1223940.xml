        <p>Yonkers lost its claim to the region's best-tasting water, sharing third place in the annual contest held on the steps of the Museum of Natural History in Manhattan. First and second places went to the Dix Hills Water District in Suffolk County and New York City, respectively. The other participants were the village of Maybrook in Orange County and the Bethpage Water District in Nassau County. The judges were about 100 pedestrians who were walking by. ''I really can't say why we didn't win,'' said Mary Anne Wyatt-Dolan, chief chemist for the Yonkers water system. Yonkers won last year and has won six times in the 1990's. One factor may have been the use of surface water, which can take on a grassy or fishy taste in summer from algae growing in reservoirs, she said. Suffolk uses ground water. But that would not explain the loss to New York City, which relies on the same water supply as Yonkers.</p>
