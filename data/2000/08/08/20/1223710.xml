        <p>AT END OF DAY</p>
        <p>By George V. Higgins.</p>
        <p>383 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Harcourt. $24.</p>
        <p>Arthur McKeach and Nick Cistaro are the brains behind much of the loan sharking, extortion, hijacking, illegal gambling, union corruption and drug dealing in Greater Boston, gangland kingpins still fit enough, after 40 years on the streets, to do their own strong-arm work.</p>
        <p>George V. Higgins lets readers in on all this right off, but by Page 45 of ''At End of Day,'' he figures it's time to fill us in on how they rose to the top of their profession. So he has two state cops who have been chasing them for years commiserate in a coffee shop. Be nice, says one, if they could bypass the niceties of evidence, which they don't have anyway, and just tell a judge the whole rotten story.</p>
        <p>Just go into court and say, ''All right, Your Honor . . . here's the deal,'' the cop says, and then proceeds to recite in great detail to his partner -who already knows all this -- for nine tedious pages. Among the reasons this conversation would never take place: (1) the cop doing the talking would never spend all that time telling his partner what he already knows; (2) the cop doing the listening is armed.</p>
        <p>The trouble with ''At End of Day,'' Higgins's 27th novel, finished just before his death in November, is the trouble with so much of his work. He wrote strong, sometimes brilliant dialogue. But that's about all he did. Dialogue was a substitute for action. Dialogue was a substitute for narrative. Sometimes it was a substitute for a coherent plot. When it worked, it was an amazing feat, like great juggling. And it worked spectacularly in his first three books, in part because they were short, each around 200 pages. But as Higgins's later books crept to double that length, the trick turned tiresome, like watching hour upon hour of juggling. And not even Higgins could keep all the balls in the air that long.</p>
        <p>Turns out McKeach and Cistaro have a sweet deal that has kept them out of jail for years: they regularly rat out their rivals, the Italian mob from Boston's North End, to the Boston office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation; and the bureau looks the other way when McKeach and Cistaro break the law and even gives them a heads-up when the local or state cops start poking around.</p>
        <p>But there's a new agent in town, fresh from a desk job in Washington, here to take over the Organized Crime Unit. Will he go along with the immoral, illegal arrangement? McKeach and Cistaro are not sure. Neither is the corrupt agent who has been their main contact. So they arrange a meeting to feel out the new guy. He asks for some background on what's been going on. What does McKeach do? He tells him, and in the process, he implicates himself in felonies deserving of several life sentences.</p>
        <p>The plot of ''At End of Day'' was inspired by a real scandal in which F.B.I. agents got too cozy with one of Boston's mob factions. Whitey Bulger, the close-mouthed real-life mobster on whom McKeach is loosely based, would never have spilled so much to an unfamiliar agent. This should not limit Higgins, who is free to have McKeach be as un-Bulgerlike as he wishes. But McKeach, otherwise portrayed as a sharp guy, would never do anything like that either. No gangster capable of something that stupid could have dodged the law for 40 years. Higgins, stubbornly devoted to his art of telling all through dialogue, forgot that this stuff has to make sense.</p>
        <p>A hard-boiled crime writer by trade, Higgins sometimes dismissed the genre in which he worked. He saw himself not as a crime writer but as a literary figure, a novelist whose characters happened to be people who sometimes commit crimes. In ''At End of Day,'' he strains so hard to commit an act of literature that you worry he's about to pull a muscle. A writer with a strong cult following, Higgins has been lionized as the first to write dialogue that sounds the way lowlifes really talk -- praise that requires one to overlook the likes of James M. Cain, David Goodis and Jim Thompson. But no one ever did it better than Higgins when he was at his best.</p>
        <p>In ''At End of Day,'' as with nearly all of Higgins's novels, the characters gradually reveal their stories as they speak, and often lie, to one another, most of the action happening offstage. As usual, there is no trace of Carl Hiaasen-style snickering or Elmore Leonard-style winking at the coolness of it all. Instead, there is the grim moral tone of a writer who finds nothing amusing about the banal evil men who work on either side of the law.</p>
        <p>But the dialogue here is not as sharp as usual. For one thing, McKeach, who grew up in Boston's Irish enclave of Southie, should not sound like Cistaro, from an Italian neighborhood, but you can't tell them apart without the authorial attributions. It's enough to make you wonder what those years of dining at Locke-Ober and sailing on Nantucket Sound did to the ear of a writer who cut his teeth covering the New England mob for The Providence Journal and The Associated Press.</p>
        <p>Occasionally there are flashes of the old brilliance -- particularly in a taut scene in which two state cops interrogate a couple of drug dealers. But ''At End of Day'' falls far short of a return to form for Higgins. The phrase itself is revealing, a reminder of the promise of the first three books, ''The Friends of Eddie Coyle'' (1972), ''The Digger's Game'' (1973) and ''Cogan's Trade'' (1974). The self-inflicted misfortune of George V. Higgins, dead too young at the age of 59, is that he exhausted the possibilities of his innovation with dialogue and monologue in those early books. Sometimes, as with ''The Rat on Fire'' (1981) and ''Kennedy for the Defense'' (1980), he would approach but never equal his early brilliance.</p>
        <p>In the end, however, he should be judged an important figure whose experimentation inspired writers as different as David Mamet and Elmore Leonard, to name two who have cited Higgins as a major influence. A true story that has been often repeated: Leonard, once asked to name the 10 greatest crime novels of all time, would name only one, ''The Friends of Eddie Coyle.'' And that is a fine legacy after all.</p>
