        <p>JESSE BRADFORD was born into the acting world. ''My Mom was working a lot in commercials and doing voice-overs -- even when she was pregnant -- and the New York casting people were waiting for me to pop out,'' said the 21-year-old Mr. Bradford, whose father is also an actor. His first commercial was done at the age of 8 months for Q-Tips, and he has been in front of a camera ever since.</p>
        <p>This week, Mr. Bradford's latest film, a black comedy about teenagers entitled ''Bring It On,'' will be released by Universal Pictures. He plays the male lead, a 17-year-old named Cliff. His co-star is Kirsten Dunst, who plays the part of Torrence, a cheerleader vying for a spot on the high school squad. Mr. Bradford's character, who is a handsome new student, has a crush on Torrence.</p>
        <p>''It's very funny, I'm really happy and proud to say,'' he said. ''It's about cheerleading, and I had fears it was going to be cheesy. But it relishes its cheesiness! It totally works.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bradford got the part last summer while out in Los Angeles looking for work. ''On the third to last day out there, I met the director, Peyton Reed -- I didn't even read for him -- and heard one week later. Then it was two months in San Diego with cheerleaders: like, hey!'' he said, flashing a smile.</p>
        <p>When he is not making films, Mr. Bradford is a student at Columbia University, majoring in film studies. Occasionally, his acting jobs have overlapped with classes, something that also used to happen in the Norwalk public school system.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, he said, ''it's just too much.''</p>
        <p>''One of the hardest things I've ever done was when I had a 10-page paper due and I was in Paris for a month shooting 'A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries,' '' he said. ''Between shots I'd go back to my trailer and do my homework. I'd get off work and I'd want to sleep.''</p>
        <p>But he did it, and promised himself that if a film conflicted with school again, he would take that semester off. He said he would rather concentrate on one thing at a time, not wanting to compromise the quality of his work, school or film. ''I only have two semesters left before I graduate,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bradford graduated from Brien McMahon High School, resisting his parents' offer of a private school. ''McMahon is really diverse,'' he said. ''I have friendships that transcend wealth, race, status. I still hang out with 99 percent of my high school buds. Last night I saw several kids I've known since sixth grade.''</p>
        <p>When he is not working, Mr. Bradford plays guitar. His cousin Jonathan Svec, who is lead guitarist for the rock group Splender, gave him lessons eight years ago, and he was hooked.</p>
        <p>''I wake up every day and I want to play guitar,'' Mr. Bradford said. ''I've been in a couple of bands. Right now I want to get a jazz/blues band together.''</p>
        <p>In ''Bring It On,'' Mr. Bradford has a scene in which his character is playing electric guitar and has no idea his crush, Torrence, is watching. When it was shot, he was really playing, but, because of editing, another guitar was dubbed in, much to his chagrin. Because of his love for the guitar, he would like to play the role of Stevie Ray Vaughan, the Texas blues guitarist who died in a helicopter crash. ''To me, he's the closest thing there's ever been to Hendrix,'' Mr. Bradford said.</p>
        <p>With both parents working actors, Mr. Bradford learned the trade by osmosis. ''My parents taught me how to act,'' he said. ''I'd go on auditions with them, I'd watched them act. They taught me through examples.</p>
        <p>''My approach is different from a lot of people,'' he continued. ''I try to be natural, I try to focus on feeling.'' He has never had acting, singing or dancing lessons.</p>
        <p>His career has included roles in ''Presumed Innocent,'' in which he played Harrison Ford's son; in ''Romeo and Juliet'' with Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes; and in ''Hackers'' opposite Jonny Lee Miller and Angelina Jolie. He first came to the attention of the movie-going public in ''King of the Hill'' with Spalding Gray and directed by Steven Soderbergh.</p>
        <p>At the end of a lunchtime interview at a Rowayton restaurant, the young actor declined dessert, after having consumed a healthy fish entree. He was thinking about his next project, which was taking him to Los Angeles in a few days.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to be on MTV's show 'Hot Zone' and I'm sure I won't be wearing much,'' he said. ''Your product is yourself. You've got to be a prime cut of meat. My motto is not to take this business seriously: it's a ridiculous crap shoot half the time, the other half is amazing.''</p>
