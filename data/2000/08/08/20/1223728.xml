        <p>THE MAGNIFICENT ACTIVIST</p>
        <p>The Writings of Thomas Wentworth Higginson (1823-1911).</p>

        <p>It is difficult to name a radical cause that Thomas Wentworth Higginson, the+agitator and man of letters, was not involved in. As demonstrated in ''The Magnificent Activist,'' a deftly edited anthology drawn from his speeches, lectures, letters, essays and books,+Higginson, the son of an eminent New England family, was an early, often pugnacious+activist in causes like women's rights,+the labor movement, child labor, freedom of religion, civil service reform and public ownership of natural resources. He first became notorious, though, as an abolitionist.+And he did not restrict himself to words: he led a crowd in Boston that attempted to free a fugitive slave about to be returned to his former owner.+He helped finance John Brown's attack on Harpers Ferry. After Brown's capture, Higginson planned to lead an armed troop to rescue him.+(Brown dissuaded him.)+During the Civil War he served as the commanding officer of the+South Carolina Volunteers, the first black regiment to join the Union Army.+Army Life in a Black Regiment''+(excerpted here) offered a frank portrait of the war and of the courage and professionalism of his troops. After the war Higginson gained a reputation as a literary essayist and critic. He became a confidant of Emily Dickinson and was instrumental in the publication of her poetry. His radicalism+never dimmed;+in 1906, at the age of 83, he joined with Jack London and Upton Sinclair to form the Intercollegiate Socialist Society. Whether arguing against+literal interpretation of the Bible or for+profit sharing between factory owners+and their employees, Higginson wrote with vigor and clarity.+Howard N. Meyer, author of a biography of Higginson, has done an admirable job of tracking down Higginson's widely scattered work and has+provided+a carefully researched commentary on his career, setting the writings in the context of their turbulent times.</p>
