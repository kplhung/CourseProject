        <p>To some, the tinkling bell evokes childhood memories of cool, creamy treats on dusky summer evenings. To others, it is a menace, a repetitive electronic jangle that tests the sanity of city dwellers.</p>
        <p>Whatever your feelings about the Mister Softee song, if you grew up in New York or any of the other cities along the nation's Softee Belt, mainly on the East Coast, it's in your bones.</p>
        <p>''It's catchy,'' said Jonathan Waldman, an Upper East Side native who stood in line recently at a Mister Softee ice cream truck near Union Square. ''When I hear the song, it kind of puts a spring in my step and makes me want to have ice cream.''</p>
        <p>Keila Tennent, another customer who knows the song from her childhood in the Bronx, was less enthusiastic.</p>
        <p>''It's annoying,'' she said, ''but it does the trick.''</p>
        <p>The song, ''Here Comes Mister Softee,'' was written in 1959 for radio and television advertisements by a Philadelphia firm, Grey Advertising. With lyrics like ''The creamiest, dreamiest soft ice cream/You get from Mister Softee,'' it has weathered four decades of music fads and fashions.</p>
        <p>It has never been revised or updated, said James Conway, vice president of Mr. Softee, citing two reasons.</p>
        <p>''No. 1,'' he said, ''it's an easily remembered tune. No. 2, after 41 years, it's extraordinarily recognizable.''</p>
        <p>Roman Vasquez, who has operated a truck at Union Square for five years, said most of his customers loved the song.</p>
        <p>''People say, 'Oh, I heard this song 10, 20 years ago,'' he said. ''They say: 'Just for one minute, I want to hear it. Please put it on.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Vasquez said he, too, liked the song, which is good, since he hears it daily from March through October. But he said he must dole it out in small quantities. A woman living nearby has called the police several times to complain about the music.</p>
        <p>Mr. Conway said such problems can arise if drivers play the song while they are parked.</p>
        <p>''Drivers become numb to it,'' he said. ''But not all people want to hear that go on for any length of time.''</p>
        <p>Customers have even called to suggest alternate songs. But, Mr. Conway said, ''We say to them, 'If you heard another song, would you know who it is?' ''</p>
