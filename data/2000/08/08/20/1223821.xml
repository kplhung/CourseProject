        <p>During his visit last month to the Workcenter of Jerzy Grotowski and Thomas Richards in Pontedera, Italy, a town on the road between Pisa and Florence, Lawrence Sacharow talked with Mr. Richards about Grotowski's theatrical legacy. Here are excerpts from their conversation.</p>
        <p>LAWRENCE SACHAROW. As an undergraduate at Yale, studying theater from a traditional point of view, what touched you about wanting to study with Grotowski?  THOMAS RICHARDS. The first bridge to Grotowski was through Ryszard Cieslak, who worked in Grotowski's Polish Laboratory Theater. He came to work with us at Yale and it was a remarkable experience, like meeting a quality of human being you don't often encounter in everyday life.</p>

        <p>During his visit last month to the Workcenter of Jerzy Grotowski and Thomas Richards in Pontedera, Italy, a town on the road between Pisa and Florence, Lawrence Sacharow talked with Mr. Richards about Grotowski's theatrical legacy. Here are excerpts from their conversation.</p>
        <p>LAWRENCE SACHAROW. As an undergraduate at Yale, studying theater from a traditional point of view, what touched you about wanting to study with Grotowski?  THOMAS RICHARDS. The first bridge to Grotowski was through Ryszard Cieslak, who worked in Grotowski's Polish Laboratory Theater. He came to work with us at Yale and it was a remarkable experience, like meeting a quality of human being you don't often encounter in everyday life.</p>
        <p>Through the way that he engaged us, I felt that we were working on something that was not uniquely theater but rather some kind of questioning, of challenging yourself. If you made a mistake, you would not be met with easy criticism but with warmth for what you had tried to accomplish.</p>
        <p>At the end of the workshop, when he was leaving, it was not like when a teacher is normally leaving a class. You had a feeling of a human loss. Someone had penetrated into your life and you had a real contact. I knew that what Cieslak had reached as an actor had to a great extent come through Grotowski. I was aware that if I wanted to touch something of a similar quality, it might be through Grotowski.  SACHAROW. You were selected by Grotowski to join a group of students in Irvine, Calif., in 1984 and work with people of different theater traditions. What was the process of work with these practitioners?  RICHARDS. In that first seminar, the practitioners were from Haiti, Korea and Bali. They led the songs we were working on at the moment. The first step was to learn the melodies precisely. We would sing for hours. Already as students we were facing an enormous test. Can you simply sit on the floor and keep your spine straight and have the mobilized impulse to sing for three or four hours? It was not just a test of endurance, however. I began to sense that something unknown was starting to happen through the repetition of the song. The melody was staying the same but the sonic resonance was changing.</p>
        <p>I remember sitting next to a woman who was leading the song and feeling the song was doing something in her. I thought, ''Ah, we're singing, but it's not just singing that's happening here.'' It was as if something else was present in her. In such a moment, faced with something unrecognized in one's own inner life, questions can arise. For example, is something missing in me?  SACHAROW. How did you come to work with Grotowski in Pontedera?  RICHARDS. In 1985, Grotowski agreed that I join the team in Irvine. I had quite a tough time in the beginning. I think I was on the lowest level in terms of craft. But then something changed. Grotowski came to see us working one day, and he saw us doing a fragment in which I was just walking. He said there was something in what I had done, the seeds of something organic. For me it was strange. I thought what I had been doing was absolutely nothing. It was from this simple walk that my working relationship with him began.</p>
        <p>He worked with me individually and everything took off. At the end of that year, he was going to move the work to Italy, and he asked me if I would be one of three assistants.  SACHAROW. Did you have any doubts?  RICHARDS. The doubts came after. I was 23 years old, so it was a very big adventure to go to another country and be the assistant of Grotowski. When I got here -- I found out what that meant.</p>
        <p>He threw me into a position of leadership and I had an enormous crisis. He asked me to conduct many aspects of the selection process. I had to lead the participants in the songs, teach them the different related movements, analyze their acting pieces. I was quite angry and said, ''You're throwing me into a situation which is beyond my capacities.'' It was really very funny, I was truly angry. I thought, ''I should be in New York, looking to start a career. What am I doing here?''  SACHAROW. Why did you stay?  RICHARDS. In my individual work with Grotowski something for me became so strong and essential, I began to understand that along with that would go a certain amount of responsibility. With the roses come the thorns.  SACHAROW. One thinks the traditional route for an actor may be easier, but in fact it's also an enormously difficult journey for a true actor, especially young actors searching for their path of work. What would you say to a young actor today?  RICHARDS. To a young actor who might be thinking along the lines of commercial versus not commercial and looking for the ''right way,'' I would say there is no unique right way. Whether you are paid for what you do or not, whether what you do is seen by 1,000 people or by 10, whether it's avant-garde or not, it seems to me that's not fundamentally the point.</p>
        <p>Yes, we've all got to eat, but what else? What comes next? There is a whole other sphere of questions related to you and what you are doing. What effect does what you do have on you? What in you does it nourish really?  SACHAROW. There seems to be a big misunderstanding in the theater community in the United States about the fact that at Pontedera the work is not performed for a public audience. Some people are critical that it is done in private.</p>
        <p>RICHARDS. Well, our work is actually not as isolated as one might suppose. It's true that people from Europe, simply because of proximity, have had more of an opportunity to encounter our research. Actually, people do see ''Action'' rather often, so we can't say that it is just private. Over the last years, many people have seen it -- both in Pontedera and when we have done projects abroad -- people belonging to theater, from other arts, from religion, anthropology, and also simply people who have written asking to see the work.</p>
        <p>So while many people have seen the work, it is not that we are doing our work for a public. What is essential here is not the quantity of people who see the work, or even that witnesses are present; ''Action'' is done many, many times with no one watching. What is important is what is being done, the relationship between us and the song, between us and the actions that are supporting the song. What happens to the human being while singing is what is important.</p>
        <p>SACHAROW. When I'm directing a play, when the audience comes, we learn more about the play from the audience. There is a give and take because you see the work in a way that you haven't seen it before, especially for the playwright.  RICHARDS. Yes, it's like when you invite someone into your home. Just from the simple fact that they will arrive, you start to see the house differently. You see places which have not been well swept or see again places of forgotten beauty. In theater arts, which are based to a certain extent on communication with an audience, the reaction of the people to whom you are trying to communicate is an important creative element.</p>
        <p>In our work there is some kind of simple distance with the people who witness, since we are not trying to communicate a message to them. It is a form of art in which the communication is between the person who is doing and what he is doing. The work on the songs is like a research into oneself. It is between the person and his own questions, between the person, the song and the technique. At the same time, there is no wall in that space when people come to see our work. The work is not hermetically sealed. A witness sitting there can perceive something.  SACHAROW. In your two books, ''At Work With Grotowski on Physical Actions'' and ''The Edge-Point of Performance,'' you describe the process of transmission -- and you are clearly continuing the work in Pontedera now that Grotowski is dead. What was the evolution that brought you to this point?  RICHARDS. He always felt the necessity that I feel freedom of choice. I can only be here and continue from inner necessity. His disappearing was not a shock. From the beginning, he told me that we would start a work that we might not have time to accomplish [Grotowski died in 1999 at 65 of leukemia]. He asked me, ''Do you want to try?'' And I said, ''Yes.'' Through his effort and conscious dealing with his health problems, he stretched a short time into 14 years, much longer than we had originally expected.</p>
        <p>People tended to see his isolation over the last years as some sort of rejection of the world. It was not. It was the practical decision of a man facing his circumstances and what he had set for himself as a task. He conserved his force for the work. I would work with the group and he would not be in the workroom. Then he would come and see the work. Be there, not be there. He was disappearing gradually as our competence grew. He was preparing us so that we might have the independence and knowledge to discover what the trajectory of the work might be in the future.</p>
        <p>He was always clear. ''Don't identify with the teacher, the work is the teacher.'' He meant that it is through practical knowledge that a tradition can move forward in a living way.</p>
