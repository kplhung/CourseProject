        <p>As political races go, this one barely registers on the radar.</p>
        <p>This summer, four candidates are running for Civil Court judge in Lower Manhattan, an area so heavily liberal that a Democratic primary win ensures a November victory.</p>
        <p>But in Greenwich Village, where local politics is a full-time hobby, the campaign  has realigned blocs and threatened to squelch the area's old-school political clubs.</p>
        <p>For years, the neighborhood's two clubhouses, the Village Independent Democrats and the Village Reform Democratic Club, have wrestled each other for the liberal mantle. More often than not, clashes centered on personalities (including a former member of both, Edward I. Koch) rather than ideology (both support sweeping gay rights, abortion rights and gun control).</p>
        <p>''It was open warfare,'' said Sean Sweeney, president of the Downtown Independent Democrats, a political club centered in SoHo.</p>
        <p>But this year the clubs have united behind one judicial candidate: a local lawyer, Joan Kenney, who works for the State Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>By combining forces, the clubs seek to embarrass a splinter group formed in January by three neighborhood power brokers: State Senator Thomas K. Duane, Councilwoman Christine C. Quinn and a Democratic district leader, Arthur Z. Schwartz. Some point to last year's bruising City Council race between Ms. Quinn and a Village Independent Democrats member as a catalyst for the departure.</p>
        <p>In the judicial race, members of the group, the Lower Manhattan Alliance for Political Action, support Ira Cure, a labor lawyer who shares a practice with Mr. Schwartz.</p>
        <p>''To political junkies and insiders, these candidates can be viewed as pawns of these various clubs,'' said Jane Sweeney, a Village Independent Democrat member who is running Ms. Kenney's campaign. ''Whoever wins will crow about being the strongest political power in Greenwich Village.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schwartz, the alliance member, said, ''If those clubs can't defeat a fairly amorphous group, it shows they are not the political forces they once were.''</p>
        <p>Hal Friedman, the Village Independent president, replied: ''It's a power grab. When Arthur Schwartz realized he couldn't take over V.I.D., he formed his own group.''</p>
        <p>The race, which also includes as candidates Barbara Jaffe, a law clerk in State Supreme Court, and Phyllis Mingione, a lawyer in private practice, promises to be costly. Spending is likely to exceed $400,000, a huge sum given that Civil Court is the lowest rung in the city's judicial ladder and that 7,000 voters or fewer are expected to turn out Sept. 12.</p>
