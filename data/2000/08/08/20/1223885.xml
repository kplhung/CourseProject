        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Salsa, popular as it is, has never reached the mass appeal that might have made the music business label it as ''pop.'' But like pop, salsa producers, beginning in the late 1980's, gambled on marketing singers as the music's stars. The creative crisis as described by Peter Watrous [''Much of Latin Pop, Aging and Sterile, Isn't Keeping Pace,'' Aug. 6] is partly due to the marketeers' having forgotten the musicians who have traditionally helped spark innovations while keeping a close ear to the music's rich heritage. (For instance, improvisation is hardly practiced by today's crooners.)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Salsa, popular as it is, has never reached the mass appeal that might have made the music business label it as ''pop.'' But like pop, salsa producers, beginning in the late 1980's, gambled on marketing singers as the music's stars. The creative crisis as described by Peter Watrous [''Much of Latin Pop, Aging and Sterile, Isn't Keeping Pace,'' Aug. 6] is partly due to the marketeers' having forgotten the musicians who have traditionally helped spark innovations while keeping a close ear to the music's rich heritage. (For instance, improvisation is hardly practiced by today's crooners.)</p>
        <p>If experience is any indication, the second-generation teenagers who cannot identify any Latin musicians will very likely soon discover the music of their parents and grandparents and realize the kinetic vitality, stylistic diversity and ''hipness'' of this ''aging'' music. In the end, the strained relation between tradition and innovation cannot be traced along an uninterrupted line of development, as Mr. Watrous does; its turns might be best conceived of as a spiral. The current crisis, for all we know, is momentary; the solution resides in the ability of listeners to open their ears.</p>
