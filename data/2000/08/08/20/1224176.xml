        <p>The Russian Navy said on Saturday that all 118 members of the crew of the wrecked nuclear-powered submarine Kursk were now probably dead and that in the frantic initial hours trapped in the sunken vessel, survivors had signaled their comrades on the surface to send down air because their sealed compartments were filling with water.</p>
        <p>Some of the men may have tried what would have been a suicidal exit through a rear hatch, a senior admiral suggested, thinking that they could swim to safety and causing one of the last dry compartments to flood.</p>
        <p>Vice Adm. Mikhail Motsak, chief of staff of Russia's Northern Fleet, said most of the sailors died in the first minutes after a still-unexplained explosion sent the Kursk crashing to the seabed a week ago. He reported his preliminary findings in a grimly dramatic statement broadcast on state television from the Northern Fleet headquarters at Severomorsk.</p>
        <p>At 7:30 this morning, Norwegian divers with video equipment began a descent to assess damage to the Russian submarine. Norwegian and British teams arrived at the site early today along with a British rescue submarine.</p>
        <p>The Kursk disappeared on Aug. 12 during maneuvers in the Barents Sea. Western intelligence sensors and seismic monitoring stations in Norway detected two underwater explosions in the area of the submarine, with the second and more powerful blast registering the yield of one to two tons of high explosive.</p>
        <p>Admiral Motsak, speaking from his desk without any prepared text, said the accident ''was the worst catastrophe that I personally have known, and the worst in the history of the submarine fleet.''</p>
        <p>He said the navy was now investigating three possible causes of the blast: a collision with another vessel or a World War II mine, or some unknown internal accident that set off the explosion that ripped through the submarine.</p>
        <p>Most of the crew died in the first minutes of the disaster, he said, just after the explosion destroyed the forward section of the submarine.</p>
        <p>Admiral Motsak interspersed his factual presentation with descriptions of the drama that has gripped Russia since Monday morning, when the navy first reported the sinking. The rescue flotilla located the battered attack submarine with twin nuclear reactors at 4:55 a.m. Sunday lying on the seabed in 350 feet of water, the admiral said. Russian surface ships soon afterward detected noises from the bottom.</p>
        <p>''We heard noises by crew members acting in accordance with the rules of organization of communication with sunken submarines,'' he said. ''Analysis of the noises from the tail sections showed that the crew members were telling us that water was coming into the sections -- it was infiltrating -- and they asked us to supply air.''</p>
        <p>On Saturday night in a separate news conference, the admiral acknowledged that rescuers had been unable to supply the air to the sailors. ''That's a possible construction defect, on which we'll have to work in future submarines,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Some crew members, desperate to escape the flooding, he said, may have tried to open the rear hatch of the Kursk, causing sea water to flood in and kill them. ''The systems responsible for a tight seal in that compartment broke down,'' the admiral said, perhaps because ''some submariners tried to leave the sub from more than 100 meters depth, which is not envisioned.''</p>
        <p>Only deep-sea divers, he said, can verify whether the hatch seal was  broken. If it was, he said, that would explain why navy rescue vehicles that have managed to dock on the hatch have not been able to evacuate water from the airtight corridor that must be established for rescue to occur.</p>
        <p>On Saturday a navy spokesman said a Russian rescue submarine made a third dive of the day on the Kursk around 8 p.m. in an attempt to lock onto the hatch and open it.</p>
        <p>Admiral Motsak said extensive flooding may have reached all of the submarine's nine compartments. That would mean that any sailors who survived the initial explosion had to endure conditions including icy water that further compressed any breathable air in the submarine to what he called lethal ''high-pressure pockets.''</p>
        <p>Naval experts in the United States and Russia said a buildup of air pressure inside any flooded compartments could have killed crew members within a few days of the sinking. Any accident in which high-pressure piping is ruptured is considered the most dangerous, said Adm. Eduard Baltin, former commander of the Soviet submarine fleet in the Pacific.</p>
        <p>Saturday night, Admiral Motsak and Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov both said at a joint news conference that after the Kursk had first been disabled by explosion or collision at periscope depth, it then lost ''longitudinal balance'' and fell into a steep dive. It hit the bottom with such force that it might have detonated a torpedo in one of the forward tubes, whose explosive equivalent is roughly equal to the blast measured by Western seismic monitors.</p>
        <p>The explosion probably ruptured high-pressure pipes in the compartments, thus increasing air pressure, Admiral Baltin said. In addition, the Russian and American experts said, intruding sea water, itself under high pressure at a depth of 350 feet, compresses the air in the closed spaces and can reach the lethal state of 10 times normal atmospheric pressure.</p>
        <p>''Slow flooding in the tail sections was taking place, which inevitably shortened the time for the crew to survive there and shortened the maximum time of sustaining life that we could count on,'' Admiral Motsak said. ''It is possible that pressure in the compartments is very high. There are air pockets there, but in fact we crossed that critical line for the sustaining of life which is envisioned in all the guiding documents. This line, in fact, was being crossed yesterday, today and maybe tomorrow.''</p>
        <p>The absence of any crew noises from the boat since Monday led the navy command to conclude ''that the critical state of the personnel has come,'' he said, adding, ''No matter how hard it is to say this, it is quite likely that we will have to admit the worst expectations.''</p>
        <p>The admiral's sober report was issued a day after President Vladimir V. Putin returned to Moscow and cut short a vacation amid criticism that he had neglected the stricken families and delayed too long on a decision for foreign assistance in the rescue.</p>
        <p>Officials in Murmansk said there were still no plans for Mr. Putin to travel to the area, where relatives again on Saturday were shown on television mourning what now appears to be the certain loss of their loved ones.</p>
        <p>Rescue crews have reported that when they twice docked on the rear hatch and then tried to pump water out of the docking corridor, water just kept flooding in. At first, navy officials believed that deformed deck plates around the hatch were preventing a tight lock. Now, Admiral Motsak said, they also believe that the rear compartment under the hatch may have been flooded and so water was rushing into the docking corridor from inside the submarine.</p>
        <p>The causes of the explosion that proved fatal to the ship and crew are still unknown, the admiral said. But a new possibility, he said, was that the 14,000-ton submarine hit a World War II mine. He said that between 1992 and 1999, six such mines have been discovered in the Barents Sea, the most recent last September.</p>
        <p>The admiral said it was difficult to pronounce the crew beyond hope ''because I have known the submarine's commander,'' Capt. Gennadi Lyachin, ''for many years.''</p>
        <p>He said the rescue operation would now move to the ''second stage,'' to concentrate on penetrating the hull of the 490-foot submarine to begin evacuation of bodies.</p>
        <p>Admiral Motsak said that the navy would eventually raise the submarine to remove its weapons and nuclear reactors from the seabed, but that ''it may take time.''</p>
