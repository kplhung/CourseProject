        <p>BARBETTA  ++  (212) 246-9171; 321 West 46th Street, between Eighth and Ninth Avenues; $$$$; smoking at the bar; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>Barbetta is the oldest restaurant garden in the city. It has been owned by the Maioglio family for more than 90 years. The menu is so old it almost seems new. Appetizers include terrine of beef or of vegetables in aspic; Parma prosciutto imported from Italy, with seasonal fruits; and seafood crepes containing lobster, crab, scallops and mushrooms. Main dishes include risotto with wild mushrooms; roast rack of lamb with braising greens; breast of free-range organic chicken with zucchini in carpione and baby rucola; and aged Angus steak, Florentine style. (Diner's Journal: 6/3/94; article: 9/19/ 97)</p>
        <p>ESCA  **  [Rating: Two Stars]  (212) 564-7272; 402 West 43rd Street, at Ninth Avenue; $$$; no smoking; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>Fish is the main thing at Esca, whose name means bait, and whose menu changes daily, depending on what comes out of the sea. Starters include lightly marinated cucumber soup; mussels and three types of clams -- mahogany, Manila and butter -- in a spicy tomato broth; and marinated red mullet with fennel four ways. Entrees include shrimp and sorrel ravioli with nettle butter; grilled lobster with roasted local corn and oven-dried tomatoes; whole roasted pompano with olives and caper berries; and roasted wild striped bass with artichoke ragu and basil puree. (Review: 6/28/00)</p>
        <p>LA LOCANDA  +  (212) 258-2900; 737 Ninth Avenue, at West 50th Street; $$; no smoking; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>This bright little storefront restaurant that opened a few months ago serves pasta and meat dishes that stand out for their simplicity and flavor, and also offers an enticing and unusually arranged wine list. Appetizers include bread crostini with assorted toppings; thinly sliced raw beef with parmesan cheese, arugula and sauteed mushrooms; and golden mushroom heads stuffed with chicken liver pate with greens and homemade mayonnaise. Entrees include linguine with baby clams, white wine, garlic, bread crumb and fresh herbs; fettuccine with sea scallops, red peppers and chives; seared tuna steak with capers and garlic sauce; and oven-roasted halibut fillet with cherry tomatoes and fresh arugula. ($25 and Under: 7/19/00)</p>
        <p>RENE PUJOL  +++  (212) 246-3023; 321 West 51st Street, between Eighth and Ninth Avenues; $$$$; no smoking; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>This classic French restaurant has been feeding the theater district for a long time and it's still going strong. Appetizers include endive-arugula salad with Roquefort and smoke duck breast; warm garlic sausage on diced potato with a shallot vinaigrette; and lobster raviolis with shiitake mushroom and lobster jus. Entrees include Dover sole, sauteed or grilled; pan-seared beef mignonettes with a mild peppery sauce; grilled semiboneless quails with rosemary-shiitake risotto and roasted shallot jus; and peppered tuna steak with red onion, green lentils and balsamic vinegar jus.

        <p>ZANZIBAR  ++  (212) 957-9197; 645 Ninth Avenue, at 45th Street; $$; smoking permitted; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>This popular restaurant and lounge serves a Gauguin canvas of a menu with African, Portuguese, Italian and Spanish touches. Starters include crispy shrimp in phyllo dough with vegetables and red vinegar; and mussel soup with garlic, diced tomato, chickpeas, white wine and cilantro. Main courses include tuna and ginger ravioli in a fresh tomato and tarragon sauce; medallions of pork tendorloin with maple syrup and pink pepper sauce with potato cake and sauteed red beets; and black lobster tortelloni with cherry tomatoes, asparagus and saffron.
