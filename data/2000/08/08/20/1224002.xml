        <p>WHEN Malik Shabazz Ducard and Althea Allison Beaton met as undergraduates at Columbia University in the early 1990's, all they had in common was a class on African politics.

        <p>After Columbia, they ended up in neighboring offices at Young &amp; Rubicam, the advertising agency.

        <p>WHEN Malik Shabazz Ducard and Althea Allison Beaton met as undergraduates at Columbia University in the early 1990's, all they had in common was a class on African politics. ''We were in completely different circles,'' Ms. Beaton said. ''I was in the sorority circle. He was one of the militant students who 'took over buildings.' ''</p>
        <p>After Columbia, they ended up in neighboring offices at Young &amp; Rubicam, the advertising agency. They became office pals, going out for drinks after work, discussing their love lives and setting each other up on blind dates. ''Althea always saw him as a good catch for someone else,'' said Audrey Grant, her sister.</p>
        <p>Finally, three years ago, after she had found him yet another blind date, he asked, ''Why not you?''</p>
        <p>Ms. Beaton, 29, had been wondering the same thing, though she is not a person who blurts out her feelings. She is so elegant and careful, that it is hard to imagine her with even a run in her stockings. Growing up in Brooklyn, she won penmanship prizes in school. She has eyelashes as long as a giraffe's, a waist as thin as Barbie's, a deep laugh and a hard-working, ambitious temperament.</p>
        <p>''From the time she was a baby, we could see she was going somewhere in life,'' Ms. Grant said. ''She used to take her Pampers boxes and stand on them and make speeches.''</p>
        <p>In her teens, she won a scholarship to attend Miss Porter's School, a private boarding school in Farmington, Conn., from A Better Chance, an organization that places and guides minority children in private schools. ''She's a Miss Porter's girl through and through,'' said Joane Amay, a friend. ''She's always courteous, prepared, poised. She can take a burlap sack and make it look like Oscar de la Renta.'' Mr. Ducard, who grew up in the Bronx, also received a scholarship from A Better Chance, and attended the Pomfret School.</p>
        <p>Almost as soon as he asked her ''Why not you?'' Mr. Ducard and Ms. Beaton segued from buddy and buddy to girlfriend and boyfriend. ''We would walk down the streets kissing,'' she remembered. ''We were in our own world.''</p>
        <p>In July 1998, they moved to Los Angeles, so Mr. Ducard could attend the business school at the University of California campus there. She got a job as a marketing and product development manager at Mattel, working on Barbie doll products. They pooled their savings to buy a used car. Within days, it was stolen from the parking lot of a fast-food restaurant.</p>
        <p>''I chased after it, and Althea panicked, because here was her man running after a stolen car in the new land,'' remembered Mr. Ducard, who is now 27 and a director of financial and strategic planning at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios. ''But after a few minutes, we were laughing about the whole situation. The police took us home. We got free refills on our Cokes.''</p>
        <p>That was a pivotal moment for Mr. Ducard, a lighthearted man who said that any woman who can laugh minutes after her car is stolen is the woman for him. She said she wanted to marry him, partly because he fitted so well into her family.</p>
        <p>''The men in my family had humble beginnings,'' she said. ''They worked hard, studied hard and reached a level of success, and Malik is cut from that same cloth.''</p>
        <p>On Aug. 12, they were married in Montclair, N.J., at the interdenominational Christ Church, a Romanesque-style building with painted ceilings and lavender and mossy-colored stained-glass windows. Outside, it was raining. Some of the female guests arrived in sleeveless gowns, raindrops still dotting their shoulders.</p>
        <p>A few days after the wedding, the bridegroom reflected on their passage from office mates to soul mates. ''It was a fast leap, an easy transition,'' he said. ''We knew everything about one another. I knew her secrets. She knew my secrets. I'm just lucky we didn't fall into the 'I don't want to ruin our friendship' trap.''</p>
        <p>WEDDINGS: VOWS  Correction:  September 10, 2000, Sunday  The Vows column on Aug. 20, about the marriage of Althea Allison Beaton and Malik Shabazz Ducard, referred incompletely to A Better Chance, a nonprofit educational organization that awarded them scholarships to private schools.
