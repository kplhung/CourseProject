        <p>FASCINATING though they may be, sometimes you just can't bring yourself to watch yet another interview with Madonna (about her New Age), Jennifer Aniston (about her new husband) or even Hillary Clinton (about her New York).

        <p>FASCINATING though they may be, sometimes you just can't bring yourself to watch yet another interview with Madonna (about her New Age), Jennifer Aniston (about her new husband) or even Hillary Clinton (about her New York). For these times, ''Cool Women,'' on the Romance Classics network, could be the antidote to celebrity burnout.</p>
        <p>The new series, which has its premiere on Friday at 8 p.m., includes profiles of women like Adrienne Dellas, a former ballerina who teaches children to dance while caring for her husband, disabled after a stroke; Cynthia Barbee, a Los Angeles County fire captain; and Lisa Schulte, who created an industry out of neon signs.</p>
        <p>The subjects vary widely in age, race and achievements, from a woman working to keep female prison inmates in touch with their children to the director of a camp for children with AIDS, from a 9-year-old owner of an Internet company that registers lost pets to an 80-year-old freedom fighter.</p>
        <p>''I was so moved by these strong, very interesting women,'' said Debbie Allen, the dancer, actress and singer who is the show's director and exeucitve producer. Her own mother, Vivian (''a firecracker, a Renaissance woman''), could well qualify for a profile, she said, ''but that's too self-serving.'' (Her sister, Phylicia Rashad of ''Cosby'' fame, however, does some narration on the show.)</p>
        <p>Ms. Allen, who produced the film ''Amistad'' wit Steven Spielberg and Colin Wilson and has written children's books (''Dancing in the Wings,'' ''Brothers of the Knight''), was approached about doing the series by Jeff Einsenberg, vice president for production and programming at Romance Classics, which along with Bravo and American Movie Classics is owned by Clablevision.</p>
        <p>''For the last two years, we've conducted research analyzing what women want from television,'' Mr. Eisenberg said. ''One of the things we found was that they wanted inspiring programming about women just like them.''</p>
        <p>Though the series focuses on little-known women, it is not entirely celebrity-free. ''A cool woman knows how to break the rules,'' says Camryn Manheim of ''The Practice'' in a quick close-up. Even the occasional man makes an appearance: ''A cool woman is a strong woman,'' offers Gen. Colin Powell.</p>
        <p>''The point of the series is to entertain while inspriring,'' said Mr. Eisenberg, who also noted that Romance Classics, which was begun in 1997 and reaches 34 million homes nationwide, is up for a change. ''In the beginning we were very niche oriented, offering only romantic films and specials and series that focused on romance,'' he said.</p>
        <p>For the premiere of the ''Cool Women'' series there will be a week of films based on real-life inspirational women, including ''Reds,'' with Diane Keaton as the feminist writer Louise Bryant, tonight at 9; ''Cross Creek,'' with Mary Steenbrugen as the author Marjorie Kinnam Rawlings, on Tuesday; and ''Norma Rae,'' with Sally Field as the Alabama union organizer, on Friday.</p>
        <p>Other new series this month include ''Style World,'' on Monday evenings at 8, with Rachel Hunter (model, occasional actress and Rod Stewart's ex-wife); ''Wine Express'' (Tuesdays at 8 p.m.), with Stefanie Powers (''Hart to Hart''); and ''Tea With Fi,'' a series of British dramas on weekdays at 5 p.m., with Fiona Hutchinson (''Guiding Light'' and ''One Life to Live'') as the host.</p>
        <p>''The network's target audience is women, mainly 18 to 54, but we invite men as well,'' Mr. Eisenberg said.</p>
        <p>Where women go, men often follow, Ms. Allen noted, invoking the block-buster weepfest ''Titanic.'' ''But I might be daydreaming,'' she admitted. ''Somebody's got to be the optimist!''</p>
        <p>Thirteen more episodes of ''Cool Women'' have been ordered for next season, Ms. Allen said, but no matter how many more episodes are to come, ''We'll never run out of women.''</p>
