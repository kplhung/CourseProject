        <p>LIEF-Nina R. The staff and board members of the Center for Comprehensive Health Practice (CCHP) mourn the death of Dr. Lief, our friend and colleague of 33 years. She was an American pioneer in teaching both parents and professionals about the role of parent-child interactions in the emotional and social development of young children. In addition to many journal articles and conference presentations, her innovative approach to parenting education is most fully documented in a popular three volume series on the first three years of life. Her career as a dedicated physician spanned seven decades. Dr. Lief was a diplomate of three American medical boards: pediatrics, psychiatry and child psychiatry. She was appointed to the faculty of New York Medical College when she joined our staff in 1967. The Early Childhood Development Center, which she initiated and directed, is a vital part of CCHP. We extend our condolences to Dr. Lief's family, and, on behalf of the thousands of families who have already benefited from her work, celebrate her life of vision and caring for children. Dr. Richard Brotman, Chief Executive Officer David Hutson, Operations Director Center for Comprehensive Health Practice</p>
