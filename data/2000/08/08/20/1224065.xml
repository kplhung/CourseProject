        <p>IN Vice President Al Gore's campaign to change his robotic image, nothing may have helped more than the big smooch. Mr. Gore stepped on stage at the Democratic Convention on Thursday and greeted his wife, Tipper, with a quick embrace and a kiss on the lips. But instead of letting go, as nice politicians are supposed to, he wrapped her tighter in his arms, closed his eyes and gave her a full-mouthed kiss that lasted a exceptionally long time. (Actually three seconds; we have tapes; we've counted.)</p>

        <p>IN Vice President Al Gore's campaign to change his robotic image, nothing may have helped more than the big smooch. Mr. Gore stepped on stage at the Democratic Convention on Thursday and greeted his wife, Tipper, with a quick embrace and a kiss on the lips. But instead of letting go, as nice politicians are supposed to, he wrapped her tighter in his arms, closed his eyes and gave her a full-mouthed kiss that lasted a exceptionally long time. (Actually three seconds; we have tapes; we've counted.)</p>
        <p>When he remembered where he was -- on national television about to accept his party's nomination for president -- he backed away and went on with his business.</p>
        <p>Of course, he could not really have forgotten the cameras for a second, and soon commentators were speculating about how calculated the kiss was. Mrs. Gore had spent days on the talk show circuit trying to humanize her husband's image, after all. And here was the living proof of his humanity, and a photograph the papers couldn't resist.</p>
        <p>The next day MSNBC had two people on the case. Chip Reid reported that he had interviewed the Gores' daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, who told him that kind of kissing goes on around the house all the time. He did not report whether the Gore children had spent much of their youth saying, ''Yuck! Mom! Dad!''</p>
        <p>More substantively, Claire Shipman of NBC speculated to Don Imus that the kiss sent a message. It signaled that Al Gore (unlike some presidents we know) is a faithful husband. Excellent point; imagine what would have happened if the Clintons had dared such a scene. Though some viewers were charmed by the Gore kiss and others squirmed, no one doubted that it was based on reality. There you have what really makes it seem odd. The kiss struck everyone as a political gesture based on truth, and nothing is rarer than that.</p>
        <p>In itself, the kiss had an old-fashioned, romantic innocence. It resembled the moment at a wedding when the groom is asked to kiss the bride and the guests can only wonder: will he give her a chaste little peck or go for it? In an earlier era, the full-mouthed bridal kiss said, ''We can have sex now, we're married.'' Among the list of promises Mr. Gore made in his speech, the ultimate promise may have been the one he sent with body language: to restore All-American marital sex to the White House.</p>
