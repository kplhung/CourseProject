        <p>MOLLYSUE WEDDING loves listening to people talk, so it was logical for her to start a business like Tall Tales, recording and producing people's stories.</p>
        <p>''I found that people always share their stories with me,'' she said, sitting in front of a wall of audio equipment in her home here. Indeed, Ms. Wedding, 43, has spent two decades working as a sound technician for television and conducting interviews for documentaries.</p>
        <p>Now people hire her to record their memories, their advice to future generations or anything else they want to pass on in the form of a compact disc.</p>
        <p>''Couples come and ask me to record their parents,'' she said. ''People read their journals or letters. Older women want to give advice to young girls.''</p>
        <p>In her cottage, several hundred feet above the Croton River, computers and digital editing equipment fill part of the house. This is where Ms. Wedding takes hours of interviews and edits out the ''ums,'' and empty space and puts memories, sometimes very old ones, into chronological order.</p>
        <p>''When you get older and forget,'' she said, smiling, ''you start to embellish.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Wedding began her business in 1998 after using her audio equipment to interview her family and friends. She enjoyed making the interviews into stories for her family, so she started advertising in Scarsdale, Bedford and Hastings-on-Hudson.</p>
        <p>At first she was hired by one or two people a week. She now handles eight clients at a time and says she has recorded hundreds of stories for people, including repeat clients who ask her to record other members of their families.</p>
        <p>Creating a CD of 30 to 60 minutes takes from one to three months and generally costs about $1,000. After recording and editing the stories, the final product is presented to the client for approval.</p>
        <p>''That takes forever,'' she said, explaining that people are never satisfied with their own voice on tape. ''I say to people, 'Don't be the final judge yourself, let someone else do it.' ''</p>
        <p>To produce coherent and truthful stories, Ms. Wedding uses her experience interviewing for documentaries to help jog memories and make people feel comfortable.</p>
        <p>When an elderly woman and her niece hired her, Ms. Wedding interviewed the aunt in the car as they drove around the town in the Catskills where she had grown up. ''We went to the cemetery and recorded her talking about her relatives,'' she said. ''It helps stimulate the memory.''</p>
        <p>Drawing coherent stories out of grandparents isn't always easy. Not only do people recount stories in bits and pieces but sometimes they also have a hard time telling them at all.</p>
        <p>''A lot of it's tough, and it needs to be told,'' she said, referring to the traumatic stories she coaxes from clients. ''Some old people say, 'Why does anyone want to hear about me?' ''</p>
        <p>Perhaps Ms. Wedding's greatest talent is her ability to ask the right questions. Aside from recollections of weddings, children being born and other major events in everyone's life, she asks about the life and times of people's families: questions like ''How did you get around?'' which gets people to recall a different way of life.</p>
        <p>''I interview people all the time who tell me about the time before telephones,'' she said, adding that most people over 85 remember having to get around before cars were so common as they are today.</p>
        <p>''Just to find out that stuff and pass it on to the next generation is important,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Wedding happily recalls one such instance. ''I asked a woman, 'Do you remember your phone number?' and she told me four numbers,'' she said. She asked the woman whether one only had to dial four numbers back then, to which the woman responded, ''Dial?''</p>
        <p>Born outside Cincinnati and raised outside Philadelphia, Ms. Wedding acted during and after college, eventually doing sound for productions. She has spent two decades doing documentaries, television and radio from Australia to Eastern Europe.</p>
        <p>When she returned from an interviewing stint in Cyprus two years ago she had a lot of expensive equipment lying around, so she decided to interview her mother. ''I came back here, and I couldn't continue doing talk shows and sports,'' she said. Those subjects no longer interested her.</p>
        <p>In the background the voice of her mother, recounting the birth of Ms. Wedding's aunt, gently punctuated the silence.</p>
        <p>Every nuance of the voice was distinguishable, and every now and then Ms. Wedding moved her computer mouse and erased a stutter or a lengthy pause.</p>
        <p>''She's my favorite storyteller,'' Ms. Wedding said. ''She told great stories, and I didn't want to lose that.''</p>
        <p>Recalling the Birth of a Sister</p>
        <p>Here are excerpts from a recording of Marie Wedding Greene, Mollysue Wedding's mother:</p>
        <p>We had a family friend who had a birthday the same day as my older brother Haskel. She was really nice. We lived next door to them in Adison, Ky. Mr. Mack worked at the dam that was in the Ohio River.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mack liked to play with us. One day he came home early, and the first thing he said was: ''Hey, Haskel, guess what I saw at your house? You have something there. Something you'd really like.'' And he said, ''I'm not going to tell you till you guess, and Marie, you guess too!''</p>
        <p>We guessed kitty cats, dogs, just anything. A bag of candy or a new dress. Haskel thought he had new shoes or something like that. He said, ''Nope, none of that, you have a new baby sister.''</p>
        <p>And with that Haskel took off down this dirt road, which was nothing but dust, and he ran two miles, and I followed him. We ran in the house, and there was mother sitting up in the bed. No one told us we were going to have a baby sister. They didn't tell you in those days. So it was just a complete shock to us.</p>
        <p>I can see the doctor. He had a little old-time-looking bag, and it was up on the bed. He sat it on the floor and picked me up and sat me on the bed so I could see. I peeped down into the blanket. Mom was holding Mildred.</p>
        <p>Oh, Lord, we just had spasms. I don't know what you call them, but we were so tickled to have a sister. But we didn't even know she was pregnant. We were too small to think about momma having a big tummy. It was mommy. She let us sit there and watch Mildred nurse. It was like getting a new bicycle for Christmas.</p>
