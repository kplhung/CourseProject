        <p>After pleading guilty to hazing violations that led to the death in December of another student, seven former members of an underground fraternity at Iona College were sentenced to 30 hours each of community service. As part of the District Attorney's Clear Choices program, a drug and alcohol prevention effort, the seven will speak to other teenagers about substance abuse. The students were charged after the death of Kevin Lawless, 18, who had a 0.34 percent blood-alcohol level on Dec. 13, the final night of a 30-day pledge period for Sigma Tau Omega, a fraternity that had been banned from the Iona campus in the 1980's because of hazing and alcohol abuse. The students were also fined $125 each and given a one-year conditional discharge.</p>
