        <p>LOST, delayed or mishandled luggage is one of the vexations associated with flying. Passengers who responded to a survey on the Web site www.frequentflyer.oag.com last month cited lost luggage as their second biggest aggravation -- behind being bumped from an overbooked flight, but ahead of missing a flight or having one canceled. While a certain amount of luggage seems always destined to be lost or delayed, several services in effect or in the pipeline will either help track bags in transit or offer the convenience of having bags picked up or delivered at a traveler's home or hotel.</p>
        <p>One is offered by Certified Airline Passenger Services of Las Vegas. Passengers can check luggage for $6 a bag at any of eight participating Las Vegas hotels (including Bally's, the Las Vegas Hilton and the Flamingo Hilton), and it will be taken to the proper airline (America West, Delta, Southwest and Sun Country). The service does not yet transport luggage from the airline to the hotel, but passengers can get seat assignments and boarding passes at the hotel.</p>

        <p>LOST, delayed or mishandled luggage is one of the vexations associated with flying. Passengers who responded to a survey on the Web site www.frequentflyer.oag.com last month cited lost luggage as their second biggest aggravation -- behind being bumped from an overbooked flight, but ahead of missing a flight or having one canceled. While a certain amount of luggage seems always destined to be lost or delayed, several services in effect or in the pipeline will either help track bags in transit or offer the convenience of having bags picked up or delivered at a traveler's home or hotel.</p>
        <p>One is offered by Certified Airline Passenger Services of Las Vegas. Passengers can check luggage for $6 a bag at any of eight participating Las Vegas hotels (including Bally's, the Las Vegas Hilton and the Flamingo Hilton), and it will be taken to the proper airline (America West, Delta, Southwest and Sun Country). The service does not yet transport luggage from the airline to the hotel, but passengers can get seat assignments and boarding passes at the hotel.</p>
        <p>By this fall, according to Marty Moore, a company spokesman, the technology will be in place to track the bags from hotel to check-in. Certified has contracts pending with American, Continental and Virgin Atlantic, and is formulating plans to expand the service to other major cities, he said.</p>
        <p>TIE Aviation Services, based at Kennedy International Airport in New York, said that next month it would start picking up luggage at passengers' homes, offices or hotels and transporting it directly to Kennedy. TIE will photograph passenger ID's and airline tickets when it picks up the luggage, and the bags will pass through TIE security (which has been approved by the Federal Aviation Administration) then be deposited in the proper airline luggage room.</p>
        <p>TIE generally collects bags four hours before a flight, and prefers 24 hours' notice. The service initially will be available in New York City only, but Zeesy Schnur, a spokeswoman for the company, said that it planned to expand the service in a few months and to deliver baggage to La Guardia and Newark airports as well as to J.F.K. The cost is $25 a bag, or $18 each for two or more.</p>
        <p>Last month, the British Airport Authority rolled out Baggage Direct, which it guarantees will deliver bags of passengers arriving at Heathrow airport to a home, hotel or office within three hours, via the Heathrow Express train and Lynx Express delivery service. Electronically tagged when they leave the owner's hands, the bags can be traced on the Baggage Direct Web site, and the passengers can arrange to be notified of their arrival by a text message on a mobile phone. The cost is about $39 a bag, at $1.50 to the pound.</p>
        <p>Contrary to widespread impression, most luggage arrives safely and on time. Department of Transportation statistics show that 4.8 of every 1,000 domestic airline passengers this past May, the latest month for which figures are available, reported that their luggage had been delayed or lost.  Statistically, that amounts to less than one-half of 1 percent. But that isn't likely to be much consolation to the 216,000 passengers whose luggage was lost or otherwise mishandled in May.</p>
