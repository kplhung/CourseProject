        <p>WHEN Judge Edmund Fitzgerald of Yonkers City Court found two Yonkers civil rights advocates guilty of disorderly conduct on Aug. 10 and sentenced them to 90 hours of community service, Jamila Crawford wept in the courthouse hallway.</p>
        <p>Concerned that Judge Fitzgerald's verdict could reverse the gains made by earlier civil rights leaders, Ms. Crawford, 23, said: ''I'm afraid they're trying to rewrite history here in Yonkers -- just when I thought I don't have to bother anymore about the things that worried my grandmother, like what schools we go to or what restaurants we can eat in.''</p>
        <p>Judge Fitzgerald sentenced the Rev. Darryl George, pastor of Messiah Baptist Church, to 50 hours of community service, and Leonard Buddington, a lawyer and the president of the Yonkers chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, to 40 hours for protesting the dismissal of Superintendent Andre J. Hornsby, the school district's first black superintendent, at a June 16 school board meeting.</p>
        <p>During the meeting, five protesters, including Mr. George and Mr. Buddington, took over the stage and knelt in silent prayer. They were arrested, handcuffed and taken to jail, and the school board meeting continued. Additional arrests occurred at a protest outside City Hall on June 21.</p>
        <p>Mr. George and Mr. Buddington faced up to 15 days in jail and $250 fines on charges of disorderly conduct.</p>
        <p>''I hope this doesn't set a precedent,'' Ms. Crawford said, ''and make it even more difficult for the next person who wants to come forward peacefully and make a change.''</p>
        <p>But neither Mr. George nor Mr. Buddington considered the verdict a setback.</p>
        <p>Nor did Randolph Scott-McLaughlin, the director of the Social Justice Center of Pace University School of Law and the lawyer representing them. If anything, Professor Scott-McLaughlin said, the actions of the group, known as the Yonkers 13, would likely embolden others who sought to carry on the 1960's civil rights traditions.</p>
        <p>(Two deacons of the Messiah Baptist Church were acquitted of all charges; four other members of the group accepted prosecutors' offers to dismiss charges if they avoid arrest for the next six months, and five more members of the civil rights group will be tried in October.)</p>
        <p>''I understand the feeling of young people today and the concerns of some activists,'' the professor said, ''but from my 20-year perspective as a civil rights lawyer, this verdict will not stop people from engaging in acts of civil disobedience.''</p>
        <p>On the contrary, he said, this will be a case for law students to chew on for years.</p>
        <p>''These are the kinds of cases I went to law school for,'' he said. ''And I will teach about this case on the first day of school in September because it says a lot about how the defendants took personal and professional risks to stand up for what they believe in. It's important for young people to know about that.''</p>
        <p>Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, also saw the actions of the Yonkers 13 -- specifically praying at the school board meeting -- as a natural extension of the ''peaceful protest activity that has been employed by civil rights groups from time immemorial.'' He observed, however, that peaceful prayer during a school meeting is generally not protected by the First Amendment and that a judge by law could deem it disruptive.</p>
        <p>''It sounds like what happened at the meeting was in the finest tradition of Martin Luther King Jr. and the Southern civil rights movement,'' Mr. Siegel said. ''Dr. King would probably be very proud. As a tactic, that kind of protest has been and continues to be a viable vehicle to garner public attention to alleged injustice.''</p>
        <p>No one in Yonkers disagrees more with such evaluations of the June 16 incident than Mayor John D. Spencer, who called the activists' actions at the school board meeting outrageous.</p>
        <p>''Their antagonistic style won't help minority students,'' he said. ''They're making fools out of themselves.''</p>
        <p>Behind the firing of Dr. Hornsby lies the long-simmering Yonkers desegregation case, dating back to 1986 when a federal district court in Manhattan ruled that the Yonkers schools were segregated. Although the school system has 75 percent minority students today, compared with 35 percent 14 years ago -- the city has been trying to convince the courts that it is providing enough resources to minority students.</p>
        <p>And while it was Dr. Hornsby's contention that minority students continued to be shortchanged and the state should also be held partly responsible, school board members and Mr. Spencer have taken a different tack. Rather than go through the courts to force the state to pay its share of remedying the vestiges of segregation, Mr. Spencer and the school board chose to negotiate with the state for aid that would help the schools.</p>
        <p>While the N.A.A.C.P. lauded the superintendent for raising district test scores and narrowing the achievement gap between minority and nonminority students and supported his continuing efforts, in the end the Mayor and his appointees on the school board ousted him.</p>
        <p>''The Hornsby case has had a dramatic impact on people who were afraid to voice their indignation before,'' Mr. George said. ''In my 15 years in Yonkers, I've never seen the N.A.A.C.P. more involved in recruiting and solidifying its base. This case represents a zenith for us.''</p>
