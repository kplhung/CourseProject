        <p>AMERICA REBORN</p>
        <p>A Twentieth-Century Narrative</p>
        <p>in Twenty-six Lives.</p>
        <p>By Martin Walker.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 393 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Alfred A. Knopf. $29.95.</p>
        <p>Historians, who write about the past, and journalists, who write about the present, are usually completely different species. But not so in Britain. John Keegan, perhaps the greatest military historian alive, is also defense editor of The Daily Telegraph. Jan (formerly James) Morris spent years reporting for The Guardian and still writes travel pieces, but is also the author of a three-volume history of the British Empire. Even without going as far as Morris, who changed genders as well as genres, few Americans feel at home on the pages of both history book and newspaper. Most American newspapers prefer to hire someone with a graduate degree in journalism rather than history, and our press is the poorer for it.</p>
        <p>Martin Walker is in the tradition of literate Britons who didn't stop thinking about history when they took up daily journalism. A former bureau chief for The Guardian in Washington, he has written books on the cold war, Bill Clinton and other subjects. His new book, ''America Reborn: A Twentieth-Century Narrative in Twenty-six Lives,'' reviews 100 years of American history by way of essays on some of the era's key figures, from Frank Lloyd Wright and Duke Ellington to Woodrow Wilson and George Marshall.</p>
        <p>Walker's 26 chapters are only in part capsule biographies; they also use someone's life as a springboard to comment on a larger trend or idea. The chapter on Albert Einstein, for example, talks less about him than about the tremendous boost to American intellectual life given by refugees from Nazism -- not just by scientists, but by the Frankfurt school sociologists, the Bauhaus architects and film directors like Fritz Lang and Billy Wilder. The chapter on ''Winston Churchill and the American Diaspora'' takes a man about whom one would think it impossible to say anything new and points out that he was a product of a late 19th- and early 20th-century fashion: marriages between American robber-baron wealth and British titles. There were over 100 of these alliances, including one between Consuelo Vanderbilt and the Duke of Marlborough, whose final price tag came to $20 million and financed the rebuilding of Blenheim Palace. Walker uses these marriages to reflect on how 20th-century superpower status shifted from Britain to the United States.</p>
        <p>A very different kind of archetype is found in Walker's appreciative essay on Emma Goldman. ''She became the model for the emerging complicity between the state and the media, which demonstrated the American ability to demonize and thus marginalize its more dangerous dissidents. The judicial authorities named her as a witness, or as a suspect, or as a conspirator in various cases, and the popular press then made her into a symbol of menace to the American way of life. Once the media had made her sufficiently infamous, with her politics and her free love and her defiance of laws against promoting birth control combining into a heady stew of Red lust, further judicial action was made both easier and inevitable. . . . The pattern was to be repeated throughout the 20th century, against militant labor leaders, against Communists and their sympathizers, against civil rights activists and against the antiwar protesters of the Vietnam era.'' Ironically, it made no difference to Goldman's persecutor, F.B.I. director J. Edgar Hoover, that radicals hated her outspoken, prescient denunciations of Soviet Russia.</p>
        <p>Walker looks at his other subjects with a similar eye for the larger pattern -- and for the British comparison. He sees Henry Ford, for example, not as an auto manufacturer but as a systems engineer who refined into a more compact, modern form the first great manufacturing system, the ''18th-century British Royal Navy, with its mass-produced ships and cannon, its factories for ropes and sails and barrels.'' Walker sees the automobile itself as affecting far more than roads and the oil industry: ''The automobile transformed the face of the American countryside, making the horse redundant and forcing farmers to grow new crops to replace the hay the horses used to eat. It force-fed a financial revolution to provide the decentralized credit system that allowed customers to buy them.'' And, as he points out in a later chapter on Katharine Hepburn and Hollywood, Ford's vertical control of manufacturing provided the model for the big studios, which controlled the movie industry assembly line from stars to theaters.</p>
        <p>There is no grand theme to this book, which some readers may consider a flaw. But there is a shrewd eye for the significance of people and events we otherwise take for granted, and a consistent undertone of gentle demythologizing. In his chapter on William Boeing, for example, Walker shows that the most important advances in American aviation came not from the lone pioneering inventors celebrated on postage stamps, but from massive government spending during World War II and the cold war. In his chapter on Betty Friedan, he points out that ''the real sexual revolution'' of the 1960's and 70's was not the erotic one the news media fixated on, but the steady movement of women into the workplace. And writing of Martin Luther King Jr., he shows that King in his last years spoke forcefully against the war in Vietnam and for economic justice, only to be posthumously sanctified by those who represented everything he had fought against. He fell victim, Walker writes, to America's ''sublime selectiveness of memory.''</p>
        <p>Walker's last essay is on Bill Clinton. The 42nd president will be remembered, he says, not for Monica Lewinsky or impeachment, but for his single-minded pursuit of free trade. True enough, although it's a pity the book did not go to press late enough for Walker to comment on the wide discrepancy in recent months between Clinton's public statements about environmental and human rights safeguards, and his private lobbying for trade deals that largely ignore these.</p>
        <p>Something else missing from Walker's book is any serious consideration of television and the Internet, which these days are surely as important as arms and diplomacy, if not more so, in spreading American influence abroad. Walker has two generals but no computer industry person, five presidents but no television mogul. But, these quibbles aside, ''America Reborn'' is a quirky, readable and thoughtful look at the American century by an outsider who knows us very well indeed.</p>
        <p>Adam Hochschild's most recent book is ''King Leopold's Ghost: A Story of Greed, Terror, and Heroism in Colonial Africa.''</p>
