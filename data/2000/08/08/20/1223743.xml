        <p>As one among the 960 passengers on the Crystal Harmony, I've also done well. But my good fortune came in the form of a phone call from an editor asking if I would like to tag along on a fashion shoot aboard a cruise set for Alaska and chronicle its pampering lifestyle. Was I available? If need be, I'd have rescheduled a kidney transplant to become available. His search for a writer was over.</p>
        <p>DAY 1: Departure, Victoria,  British Columbia</p>
        <p>The first hint that I was out of my element came on the docks. The weathered green duffel that has carried my stuff for years stood out from the rows of gleaming, sturdy Louis Vuittons. I have seen many rolling suitcases before, but none with rack-and-pinion steering. Of all the people boarding this ship, I was the only one who looked like someone dropping off laundry.</p>
        <p>Within minutes of crossing the gangway, it was plain to see that the passenger population consisted principally of two groups: senior citizens and their parents. Evidently I had arrived on this cruise three decades too soon. The bell captain pretended not to be surprised when I gave him my room number, 1028, on the exclusive penthouse deck, where spacious cabins come equipped with Jacuzzis and verandas (a fortuitous upgrade when someone called to cancel). Here among the venerable well-to-do, this punk and his plebian luggage were doing better than most.</p>
        <p>Before I could unzip my duffel, I heard a gentle knock on the cabin door. I opened it to reveal a neatly groomed, bespectacled man standing before me in a tuxedo with tails. ''Good day, my name is Cetin, and I am your butler,'' he said. A moment of silence passed that suggested he was completely serious. In his distinctive Turkish accent, Cetin (pronounced CHET-in) enumerated the many kinds of valet services and personal assistance that constituted his job. A little disconcerted, I talked him out of unpacking my clothes.</p>
        <p>My butler excused, my attention turned to an abundant platter of fruit he'd left behind. I examined it with specific interest in the bananas on top. It just so happens that I love bananas. I love them pulled from the bunch, sliced onto cereal, made into pies, puddings, ice cream and tarts. Yet I've stopped buying bananas -- at least at the supermarket -- because I've become frustrated at how quickly they turn brown. When I want a banana, I take a special trip to the fruit stand on my block and select the prima banana, the largest, yellowest specimen at the very peak of freshness. Bananas exactly like these gorgeous three my butler had brought for me this day.</p>
        <p>I had yet to peel open my prize before Cetin returned. With him he had a platter of glistening, oversize shrimp decoratively arranged in a coconut shell and accompanied by a side of cocktail sauce. I quickly forgot about the stupid bananas.</p>
        <p>DAY 2: The Inside Passage</p>
        <p>In the first, groggy minutes of the day, I pulled back the curtain not a foot from my pillow to reveal a Kodak moment: a gliding vista of inlet waters embanked by densely green forests, set off by snowcapped mountains against a clear blue sky. This view was to become very familiar during the next 16 hours of daylight as we powered up the Inside Passage on our way to Alaska.</p>
        <p>The Crystal Harmony is a floating juxtaposition. Against a backdrop of untamed wilderness, passengers enjoy the refined civility of fluffy egg-white omelets for breakfast, musty port wines after dinner, aromatherapy by day and Cole Porter revues by night. Then they return to their cabins, unwrap the truffle on their pillows and slip between their 500-thread-count sheets. After one full day of this routine, I was forced to confront my longstanding discomfort with assiduous service.</p>
        <p>Maybe it's self-reliance -- or a streak of egalitarianism -- but I've always preferred my own lackadaisical domestic efforts to the determined attentions of others. But here, resistance was futile. In addition to a butler, I had been assigned a team of stewardesses. With every return to my cabin, I would find wet hanging towels replaced with new ones clean and folded, strewn clothes returned to the (walk-in) closet and the torn toilet tissue left hanging off the dispenser neatly cornered once again. But in my mind each act registered an unspoken rebuke. ''See how easy it is to put the toothpaste cap back on the tube?'' ''Is it really so hard to hang up a shirt?'' ''The toilet is flushed after each and every use! What kind of animal are you?''</p>
        <p>Activities on board seem to fall into two categories: eating and killing time between meals. One of the most popular time-killing techniques is snacking. Among my snacks this day were the marvelously perfect bananas back in my room. I ate only one but carefully inspected the others. Though still bright yellow, I could sense their fragile ripeness approaching the precipice. Curious about their fate, I pulled a pen from my pocket and gave each an innocuous marking just below the stem, tagging them like rare birds in the wild.</p>
        <p>DAY 3: Ketchikan, Alaska</p>
        <p>I leapt from bed to begin the day that was to bring us into the port of Ketchikan. As I tightened the laces of my snazzy Nike hiking shoes, an eyelet on the left shoe popped, rendering the lace only partly useful. Suddenly things had taken a turn for the worse, and my anger turned to Kathie Lee Gifford and the shoddy workmanship of her minions. (I know that's not entirely fair. Kathie Lee is the spokesperson for an entirely different cruise line.) I had begun to search my cabin for makeshift tools to repair the shoe when I suddenly remembered: I am a guy with a butler! I picked up the phone; in short order Cetin was standing before me. The shoe was repaired before we pulled into port.</p>
        <p>On a seaplane ride over mystic fjords and a rolling green landscape of glacier-carved valleys, I oohed and aahed alongside a friendly couple. Patrick, the man's name, was the ship's guest chef, who had prepared the meal served the night before in the main dining room, a meal I had missed because the fashion team had booked a table at the ship's Italian restaurant instead. Patrick recited his menu, from appetizer, salad and entree to, most memorably, dessert: a banana cheesecake draped in a chocolate caramel sauce. Excuse me, did you say ''banana''?</p>
        <p>Upon return to the ship, I summoned Cetin once again. I had two topics to discuss with him. First, I told him that somewhere on this ship there might be a few precious slices of banana cheesecake, and I challenged him to track them down.</p>
        <p>Second, there was the issue of the fruit. Having checked in on my covert banana experiment, I found three perfect bananas on the tray, none with my telltale mark. I asked Cetin for an explanation. He pulled a notepad from his pocket and gave this answer: ''Mr. Mark, I notice that you had eaten from the plate one banana and many red grapes. So today I bring you more like this -- plus green grapes, which I thought you might like.'' The bananas I had marked, he told me, might turn up again sliced into a fruit salad or pureed into a smoothie. At this point, no one could know for sure.</p>
        <p>I was very impressed with him at that moment, but my esteem climbed even higher when he returned 10 minutes later with the banana cheesecake. Between cobbling my shoes and hunting for yesterday's dessert, my butler had saved the same day twice.</p>
        <p>DAY 4: Glacier Bay</p>
        <p>One of the services Cetin seemed especially eager to provide was preparing a party, should I wish to give one. On this day, our ship was to take us through the spectacular glacier bays to a reliable whale-watching site by late afternoon. I told Cetin to plan for a dozen guests -- my fashion-shoot colleagues and a few nice people I'd met by the pool -- at a time that would coincide with prime whale-watching hours. To ascertain when that would be, I found my way to the captain's bridge and explained my query to the ship's navigation officer, Takeshi. Compass in hand, Takeshi leaned over his maps and charts and crunched a few numbers. ''Tell your guests optimal time for arrival is 4:45,'' he instructed. Listening in on our conversation was another uniformed gentleman, Deputy Captain Seiji. He approached to review Takeshi's charts and offered his own estimation: 4:35. Upon further questioning, it turned out Seiji concurred completely with Takeshi's calculation but, in his experience, guests usually arrived 10 minutes late.</p>
        <p>Later that afternoon, at exactly 4:53, 20 guests marveling at a family of humpback whales swimming and spewing just 100 feet from my deck raised a glass or a crab claw to toast the excellent work of Officer Takeshi, Deputy Captain Seiji and Butler Cetin.</p>
        <p>EPILOGUE: Continental Airlines Flight From Seattle to Newark</p>
        <p>Crammed into a middle seat on an overbooked red-eye back to New York, my odyssey to indulgence was officially over. While I suffered from culture shock, at least my luggage could enjoy more familiar surroundings. Following nearly a week of unyielding service and fine food, my dearest wish was that a stewardess would remove my half-eaten Salisbury steak so I might reach for a pillow to cover my ears to mute the shrill of infants crying. Yet the irony of my situation failed to bring a smile to my face.</p>
        <p>All I could do was lament my immediate circumstance and wonder how my life had suddenly gone so terribly, terribly wrong.</p>
