        <p>The Great Auditorium in Ocean Grove will reverberate with the sounds of Irish music and dance next Saturday as three Irish ensemble groups celebrate the Celtic tradition.</p>
        <p>The Irish Rovers, who had their first hit with ''The Unicorn'' in 1967, have been touring and making records for more than three decades. Three of the original Rovers, George Miller, Joe Millar and Wilcil McDowell, will be joined by John Reynolds, Sean O'Driscoll and Kevin McKeown. In addition to their tours and recordings, such as ''Wasn't That a Party?'' written by Tom Paxton, the Rovers, based in Toronto, had a hit weekly variety show on Canadian television in the 1970's.</p>

        <p>The Great Auditorium in Ocean Grove will reverberate with the sounds of Irish music and dance next Saturday as three Irish ensemble groups celebrate the Celtic tradition.</p>
        <p>The Irish Rovers, who had their first hit with ''The Unicorn'' in 1967, have been touring and making records for more than three decades. Three of the original Rovers, George Miller, Joe Millar and Wilcil McDowell, will be joined by John Reynolds, Sean O'Driscoll and Kevin McKeown. In addition to their tours and recordings, such as ''Wasn't That a Party?'' written by Tom Paxton, the Rovers, based in Toronto, had a hit weekly variety show on Canadian television in the 1970's.</p>
        <p>The all-women vocal ensemble Cherish the Ladies, which has been cited by the Library of Congress for its outstanding traditional Irish music recordings, also will perform. Cherish the Ladies, named for a popular Irish jig, collaborated with the Boston Pops on a Grammy-nominated Celtic album and recently recorded another album, ''Threads of Time.''</p>
        <p>The six women in the group perform both traditional and contemporary Irish songs and play a number of instruments including the Irish whistle, the mandolin and banjo.</p>
        <p>The Donny Golden Champion Dancers will round out the evening with a performance of Irish dances. Donny Golden, a regular performer with the Chieftans, has taught award-winning Irish dancers, including Jean Butler of Riverdance.</p>
        <p>The performance will start at 8 p.m. Tickets are available at (732) 988-0645 or (800) 773-0097.</p>
