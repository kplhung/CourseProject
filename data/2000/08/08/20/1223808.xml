        <p>I WAS relieved not long ago when Riccardo Muti withdrew his candidacy for the conducting job at the New York Philharmonic. Mr. Muti is a very good musician and has a lot of the qualities this peculiar post requires. In his brief visits during the last couple of years, he won the approval of players, and these are a tough, experienced bunch not known for starry eyes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Muti also has a world cachet and, as music director of the Philadelphia Orchestra for 12 years, a lot of experience in this country. Both assets are important. The New York job is exposed as few others, operating as it does in what might be called the communications capital of the world. A larger-than-life city tends to devour the shy and retiring regardless of their skills. Mr. Muti, by virtue of his Philadelphia experiences, knows all about the glad-handing and schmoozing that accompany the American orchestra's constant effort to raise money from individuals, foundations and corporations.</p>

        <p>I WAS relieved not long ago when Riccardo Muti withdrew his candidacy for the conducting job at the New York Philharmonic. Mr. Muti is a very good musician and has a lot of the qualities this peculiar post requires. In his brief visits during the last couple of years, he won the approval of players, and these are a tough, experienced bunch not known for starry eyes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Muti also has a world cachet and, as music director of the Philadelphia Orchestra for 12 years, a lot of experience in this country. Both assets are important. The New York job is exposed as few others, operating as it does in what might be called the communications capital of the world. A larger-than-life city tends to devour the shy and retiring regardless of their skills. Mr. Muti, by virtue of his Philadelphia experiences, knows all about the glad-handing and schmoozing that accompany the American orchestra's constant effort to raise money from individuals, foundations and corporations.</p>
        <p>He also admires the Philharmonic musicians, and like most European maestros he is hypnotized by the remarkable skills and adaptability of American orchestra players. This is a level of playing Mr. Muti can find on certain evenings at La Scala Opera in Milan, where he is music director, but orchestra quality in most of Italy ranges from mediocre to bad. A young American conductor invited to oversee a production in one of the country's high-end opera houses told me how amazed he had been when he was given 12 orchestra rehearsals instead of the 3 or 4 he was accustomed to. Amazed, that is, until he got there. He needed every one, and more.</p>
        <p>Mr. Muti must also have been soothed by the relative smoothness and good-sense pragmatism of musical administrations in this country. Where musicians gather, there will always be intrigue and bad feeling, but here the backbiting is minimal compared with the lunacy and chaos that seem to go on behind the office doors of La Scala.</p>
        <p>Yet throughout the recent negotiations, at least as they were relayed to the public, Mr. Muti's body language told us he did not want the job. The demands were extravagant. I have heard terms that would have required his presence as little as eight weeks a season and involved a salary as high as $2 million.</p>
        <p>My brief personal encounters with the man and the interviews I have read indicate to me someone who doesn't really like this country very much. The manner is imperious if not downright arrogant. Being an upwardly mobile southern Italian of humble origins operating in Milan, the seat of northern Italian aristocracy, has not been easy for him, and perhaps the casual egalitarianism of the American personality is something he would like to forget.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Muti is not hurting for work; he is the darling of the Vienna Philharmonic and does many of its concerts and tours. At the Vienna, he is a good fit. His repertory, like the orchestra's, is small and conservative. He is also, like the Vienna's personnel, a tremendously sound musician, though I don't think anyone would ever accuse this conductor of having transcendent visions. In a Muti performance, everything works. The moving parts and the speeds at which they move are perfectly gauged. Mr. Muti is concrete and literal, but at the same time he is not boring or cold. I don't think he has a mystical bone in his body.</p>
        <p>If the Vienna is unmatched in its cozy repertory of standards, the New York Philharmonic is versatility itself: a band of extraordinary virtuosos who can switch from Haydn to Berio on a dime, provided they have the right conductor. Mr. Muti, who labored long and unsuccessfully to transform the Philadelphia from an awesome luxury item into the bright, shiny Italian orchestra he never found in his own country, would have exploited only a corner of the New York's potential. His ventures into the present tend to be safely established 20th-century classics or works by second-rate Italian composers.</p>
        <p>The Philharmonic has suffered underutilization since the exits of Leonard Bernstein and Pierre Boulez as music director. Zubin Mehta exploited its virtuosity in the cause of flash and shallowness. Kurt Masur has been a stern corrective during the last seasons, and we should be grateful to him. But Mr. Masur's sober repertory and tense musicianship barely touch this orchestra's potential.</p>
        <p>Who is right for the job? Simon Rattle, but he doesn't want it. Otherwise, only God knows. No one who takes the job could do it in eight weeks a season. Twice or three times that much, but not eight. We should ask ourselves why the city's other major ensemble, the Met Orchestra, has come to be so extravagantly admired both in concert and in the pit of the Metropolitan Opera.</p>
        <p>My colleague Patrick J. Smith at Opera News summed it up not long ago: first, 25 years with one superior and sympathetic conductor, James Levine; Mr. Levine spends months, not weeks, with these players every year, and he need only raise an eyebrow on the podium to tell them what he wants. The Levine method, Mr. Smith points out, has been systematic, with a new component to be perfected each season: one year, intonation; the next, ensemble; the next, balance. Think of what the New York Philharmonic could be with long-term leadership like that. Eight weeks wouldn't do. Neither would Riccardo Muti.</p>
