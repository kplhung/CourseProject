        <p>Toymax International Inc. of Plainview (Nasdaq: TMAX) reported record first-quarter sales of $25.1 million, attributing the growth mainly to its acquisition of several businesses earlier this year.</p>
        <p>The company increased operating income to show a profit of $67,000, compared to a loss in last year's comparable quarter of $701,000. Net loss fell to 2 cents a share, from 3 cents a year earlier.</p>

        <p>Toymax International Inc. of Plainview (Nasdaq: TMAX) reported record first-quarter sales of $25.1 million, attributing the growth mainly to its acquisition of several businesses earlier this year.</p>
        <p>The company increased operating income to show a profit of $67,000, compared to a loss in last year's comparable quarter of $701,000. Net loss fell to 2 cents a share, from 3 cents a year earlier.</p>
        <p>The rise in sales came largely from the acquisition of Monogram International and the Funnoodle product line. These gains were partly offset by a decline in the promotional toy business.</p>
        <p>The net loss was attributed in part to a joint venture with Yaboom Ltd., which makes entertainment-based toys and electronics.</p>
