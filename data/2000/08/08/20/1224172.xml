        <p>Teresa Weatherspoon will watch videotapes of tigers today to tap her ferocity. Tari Phillips will watch game videos of her own mistakes to make her angry.</p>
        <p>And Tamika Whitmore will shadowbox to gospel music this morning to become fierce for the Liberty's must-win W.N.B.A. playoff game against the Cleveland Rockers this afternoon at Madison Square Garden.</p>
        <p>''Tomorrow I don't think anybody's going to realize who I am,'' Whitmore said sweetly while standing outside after the Liberty's practice yesterday at the Brearley School in Manhattan. ''I'll be a totally different person. Just get out of my way. Nobody is going to get their way but us.'' And with that, she stepped on a bumblebee.</p>
        <p>The Liberty players have no choice but to assert themselves, having returned to New York after a  56-43 loss in Game 1 of the W.N.B.A.'s two-of-three-game Eastern Conference finals. One more loss in this series and the Liberty begins its off-season.</p>
        <p>''We need to be the aggressor,'' Phillips said. ''We need to come out and take it to them like they did to us.''</p>
        <p>For two days since Thursday's loss, the Liberty players have been reviewing game films and practicing with abandon. Yesterday, Coach Richie Adubato cut practice 20 minutes short because the scrimmage between teammates wearing black and white turned more into black and blue.</p>
        <p>He does not need injuries now -- Weatherspoon emerged with a bleeding cut on her right cheek -- but was very encouraged nonetheless.</p>
        <p>''I've seen a lot of signs of change already,'' Adubato said. ''They had very good focus, and I know we're ready to play this game.''</p>
        <p>The Liberty had a closed-door meeting right after the loss in Cleveland, and the players have since viewed that loss only as instruction. ''It's over and we're past it; we can't hold on to it,'' Sue Wicks said. ''In practice today, we made sure things happened. If we needed a steal, there was no way we would let the ball go anywhere. We had to make everything go our way.''</p>
        <p>In Game 1, the Rockers outrebounded the Liberty by 12 and disrupted the flow of the Liberty's offense. Cleveland's emotional small forward, Mery Andrade, is as physically strong a defender as she is a brilliant actor, say the Liberty. Taking an unintentional touch to the chest from Phillips, Andrade flopped backward, clasped her chest and earned an official's call.</p>
        <p>''It's all about anticipation,'' Andrade said, smiling a bit whimsically. ''You know, Tari Phillips does a great job, too. She took some charges from Chasity Melvin, and I couldn't do any better.''</p>
        <p>That's high praise. ''Tell her I'll be the one to present her the Academy Award,'' Phillips responded.</p>
        <p>In Thursday's game, Andrade even jumped early when Whitmore was shooting foul shots, putting a hand in her face before she released the ball. ''What she gets away with is incredible,'' said Adubato, who left messages with league officials to alert them to her tactics.</p>
        <p>Wicks just shrugged. ''You don't like what she does, but then you think: 'I love that girl. I want to play like that,' '' Wicks said.</p>
        <p>Andrade, the midseason replacement starter when the team's leading scorer, Eva Nemcova, was lost for the season with a knee injury, empowers her team with toughness.</p>
        <p>''Especially now in the playoffs, the strong will survive,'' Andrade said, but she admitted the Rockers, after a 7-25 season last year, were surprised to be just one game away from the W.N.B.A. finals. ''We set goals from the beginning. If I said our first goal was to get to the finals, I would be lying.''</p>
        <p>Cleveland Coach Dan Hughes thought his team might not be able to play any tougher defensively. And since the Rockers will be playing at the Garden, where they have lost both games this year, they must find a way to neutralize the Liberty's intensity. ''We've got to have some balanced scoring inside and off the transition,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Last year, the Liberty faced the same situation, losing to the Charlotte Sting in Game 1 and then rallying to win the next two games to capture the Eastern Conference championship. ''I don't feel like we're in trouble,'' Whitmore said. ''It's just a matter of us playing the way we know how.''</p>
        <p>The Liberty players promise that their game will return now that they are back at the Garden, where they have won 11 straight games.</p>
        <p>''You want to keep the same mentality that you had all year, just that you're down one game,'' Weatherspoon said. ''One thing you have to be is totally intense from the time you enter the arena. My mission needs to be accomplished. We go game by game, we win this game, it's in the air.''</p>
