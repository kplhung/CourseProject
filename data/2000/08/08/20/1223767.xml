        <p>HIDDEN in a grove of pines on a finger of land overlooking Lake George in the foothills of the Adirondacks is a shrine to a remarkable woman. Her lovely musical name was Marcella Sembrich, and though virtually forgotten today, this Polish-born soprano was once one of the glories of the operatic stage.</p>
        <p>During a career that spanned half a century, she sang all the big roles, performed with the greats of her day, and won nothing but raves. Critics and fans adored her. At the 1909 gala at the Met that marked her retirement from opera performances shortly before she turned 51, ''an audience of monstrous size packed the house to suffocation,'' a critic for The New York Sun noted. Gustav Mahler led the orchestra in the march from ''Figaro'' that evening as Sembrich was escorted to a throne and showered with gifts and rose petals. The event was Page 1 news in The New York Times.</p>
        <p>The shrine in question is a doll-sized studio of pink stucco where Sembrich embarked on a second career as a voice teacher. She made her summer home in the tiny village of Bolton Landing in 1922, opened the studio in 1924 and taught there until shortly before her death in 1935. Two years later, the studio was converted into a small house museum, and although Sembrich and her acolytes are long gone, this trove of operatic memorabilia offers a haunting picture of an extraordinary era.</p>
        <p>Outwardly, Bolton Landing appears to be your typical lakeside tourist center, pleasantly sleepy in comparison with Lake George village, its slightly raucous neighbor to the south. But the Sembrich Museum  recalls the hamlet's heyday at the turn of the century. Along with Lake George village, it was a summer haven for New York's moneyed class, a place where gilded age Knickerbockers built imposing mansions on pine-scented lakefront, thereby savoring both incomparable views and the lush comforts of home.</p>
        <p>Nearly all the fine buildings that once lined the lake are gone, replaced by far less glamorous newcomers. Typical of the upstarts is the Melody Manor Resort, which sits on property once occupied by the grandly named Marie Antoinette Villa. Its past occupants included the millionaire Harry K. Thaw, forever remembered as the husband of Evelyn Nesbit -- the ''Girl in the Red Velvet Swing'' -- and the man who fatally shot her lover, the architect Stanford White. All that's left of the place is a stone gatehouse, its original function long forgotten.</p>
        <p>Of the few historic structures still standing, the bulk are in private hands and off  limits to visitors. For the most part, the self-directed driving and walking tours suggested by the Town of Bolton Bicentennial Committee (the town celebrated its 200th birthday last year) take a visitor past sprawling lawns and insistently modern structures. With only an occasional granite wall or rusting wrought-iron gate to suggest what stood long ago, it's a frustrating but tantalizing, and unexpectedly moving, journey.</p>
        <p>From books, photographs and the occasional survivor that has escaped the wrecking ball, it's possible to piece together a vivid picture of what life must have been like in what was one of the most desirable enclaves in the Adirondacks.</p>
        <p>The best guide to the area is ''The Great and the Gracious on Millionaires' Row: Lake George in Its Glory'' by Kathryn E. O'Brien (North Country Books, 1978), a delightfully anecdotal study of the families who summered along the 10-mile strip between Bolton Landing and Lake George Village.</p>
        <p>As I learned from reading this lavishly illustrated book and by doing a little discreet trespassing on my own, one of the surviving splendid buildings is the William K. Bixby mansion on Mohican Point, just south of the center of town. A spanking white Colonial-style structure, it was built at the turn of the century and is still a summer home to descendants of the original family.</p>
        <p>The family made its money in railroads, and money was no object when it came to outfitting its lakefront quarters. Period documents reveal that a veritable fleet of different types of boats once departed from its dock, and a corps of gardeners tended its plantings. With its pillars, gables and forest of chimneys, the Bixby mansion still stands tall, visible from both the road and the water.</p>
        <p>The Bixby family may be best known because Harold Bixby, a son of William K., provided both the main financial backing and, in a tip of his hat to his old hometown, the name for Charles Lindbergh's Spirit of St. Louis. Even more interesting, at least to local schoolchildren who get to make shivery visits to the site, is the stuff about the ghost.</p>
        <p>Long before the first Bixby set foot on the property, an Indian maiden was said to have been burned at the stake near one of the mansion's locust trees. As the flames shot up, an apparition swooped down to rescue her, and the blood-red markings on a stone that sits beneath that same locust is regarded as proof of this event.</p>
        <p>The Sagamore resort lacks a ghost, but has its own stories to tell. It opened on Green Island, just north of the village center, in 1883, a great wedding cake ringed with porches. Like virtually all the lakefront hostelries, it commanded a spectacular view, and its decorative accents -- massive beams, terra-cotta fireplaces, gleaming dark woodwork -- did a good deal to conjure up 16th-century England.</p>
        <p>But bad luck seemed part of its fate. In 1893 the Sagamore was destroyed by fire, and though a year later an even more lavish hotel rose on the site, the year 1914 brought a second fire, as devastating as the first. By 1930 a third hotel had been built, the huge white palace that sits on the island today.</p>
        <p>Despite the Sagamore's checkered history, a sense of its original grandeur lingers. One afternoon I spent a few hours wandering through its spacious, high-ceilinged public rooms and wide, quiet corridors, pretending to be a refugee from an Edith Wharton novel. It wasn't hard. The crystal chandeliers, the slow-moving ceiling fans, the plump sofas and wicker chairs, the potted plants and swags of drapery made me feel as if I were back in another time. The gentle color scheme of rose and tea and celadon had a lulling effect.</p>
        <p>My favorite stroll took me along a flower-fringed pathway that led from the back of the hotel down a sloping greensward, at the foot of which a protected beach has been set up for children. It's possible to sit off to one side and watch Lake George's signature steamboats chug across the water as they have since the mid-19th century.</p>
        <p>THE Sembrich Museum, Bolton Landing's other notable survivor, is outwardly less imposing than the Sagamore but even more evocative of the past, for crammed into this modest cottage is a veritable history of opera during its golden age. And understandably, for Sembrich's career spanned some of the richest years of opera.</p>
        <p>The singer, whose story is told in an affectionate book called ''A Recollection of Marcella Sembrich'' by H. Goddard Owen (Coneco Litho Graphics, 1995), was born in 1858 in a hamlet near Lemberg. She studied piano and violin as a little girl and enjoyed a stellar early career singing in Europe.</p>
        <p>In 1877 she married her piano teacher, a man 13 years her senior with whom she remained through his entire life. (Miss Sembrich, who had no children, took her mother's name as her professional name). In 1883 she came to New York and made her American debut in ''Lucia di Lammermoor'' on the second night of the Met's first season.</p>
        <p>Photographs of Sembrich -- a seemingly endless number of them can be seen in the museum that bears her name -- reveal that she was adorable, with a mass of dark curls, huge, soulful eyes, and a winsome smile that kept her looking girlish well beyond her youth. By all accounts, she was also a world-class charmer. Henry Krehbiel, music critic for The New York Tribune, made special mention of her ''pretty witcheries, graceful coquetries'' and ''captivating ingenuousness.''</p>
        <p>But it was the heavenly quality of her voice and her ability to capture the intellectual and emotional nuances of the music that lay at the heart of her gift. It was said that Franz Liszt once instructed the young Sembrich: ''Sing, sing for the world, for you have the voice of an angel.'' Her dear friend Brahms added: ''Sembrich has a mind, a heart and a soul.''</p>
        <p>Even for someone who is not an opera aficionado, the collection of memorabilia crammed into her museum offers a fascinating window into a personality and an era. Though modest in size, the place opens with a bang, with a sumptuous display of Sembrich's costumes in the little foyer. (As was typical of divas of the day, Sembrich provided her own wardrobe and routinely traveled with 20 or 30 trunks.)</p>
        <p>Among the outfits on view is the gray cloak she wore as Mimi in ''La Boheme,'' a delicious-looking cherry velvet bolero jacket, her Queen of the Night tiara with moon and stars set against dark blue velvet from ''The Magic Flute,'' an assortment of fetching bonnets, fans dripping with feathers and sequins, and a great deal of ermine, lace and embroidery.</p>
        <p>The main room, with its beamed ceiling, heavy dark furniture, Steinway grand piano and Oriental carpets, looks much as it did when Sembrich instructed her pupils in proper breathing and intonation. Virtually every inch is crammed with mementos, for there were few stars of the turn-of-the-century operatic world whose lives did not touch Sembrich's.</p>
        <p>There is no end of tributes. From Rachmaninoff, ''I weave daisies into the crown of Marcella Sembrich.'' From Edmond Rostand: ''To the nightingale, to the thrush, to all who excel in song.'' From the conductor Bruno Walter, ''In thankful remembrance of the most glorious impressions of my young manhood.'' From Puccini: ''You are the Mimi.''</p>
        <p>There is also a profusion of scores, letters, telegraphs, portraits, autographed scores and photographs and programs -- from Brahms, Liszt, Verdi, Mahler, Toscanini, both Strausses -- the list is long. And there is a marble bust of the young Beethoven, tribute wreaths of oak and laurel leaves exquisitely wrought in silver, a replica of Chopin's death mask, an ostrich fan with a diamond-studded monogram from the Rothschild family, a loving cup from Caruso, with whom she performed in ''Rigoletto'' at his Met debut in 1903, and a miniature model of the Met stage. A few oddities reveal that she had a life off the operatic stage, among them a letter from Mark Twain inviting her to his ''doe'' luncheon. (She declined.)</p>
        <p>In the sunroom, a bay window offers yet another sweeping view of the lake, along with a glimpse of the path that winds deeper into the pines along which Sembrich must have taken many a restorative walk. In summer, concerts are held in the studio.</p>
        <p>Presiding over this little kingdom is a gentle, soft-spoken man named Richard Wargo, the resident curator and composer in residence. As I was strolling through the rooms, alone on a warm Sunday morning, he played a recording of Sembrich singing the  waltz from ''The Merry Widow.'' With his flick of a switch -- CD, not Victrola, for Sembrich has been remastered for the modern age -- the room was flooded with scratchy but deeply suggestive sound. Any visitor would have paused to savor this eerie, wonderful moment.</p>
        <p>If you go to Bolton Landing</p>
        <p>Getting There</p>
        <p>Bolton Landing is 200 miles north of New York City, a four-hour drive on the New York State Thruway and Interstate 87. Take Exit 22 off I-87 and head north on Route 9N (Lakeshore Drive).</p>
        <p>Accommodations</p>
        <p>The Sagamore, on Lake George at Bolton Landing, (800) 358-3585, has 100 rooms, including 46 suites, plus 240 rooms in lakeside lodges, half with fireplaces and terraces. Prices range from $135 for a single in the winter to $465 for a suite in the summer. The inn has a golf course, a spa, conference facilities and a range of dining options, from informal to formal.</p>
        <p>Hilltop Cottage Bed and Breakfast, 4825 Lakeshore Drive, (518) 644-2492, is a converted farmhouse operated by Anita Richards, administrative director of the Sembrich museum, and her husband, Charlie. Two rooms and a cabin, ranging from $70 to $85 for a double. The price covers a hearty breakfast on the front porch; the menu includes such German specialties as apple pancakes. Open May 15 to Oct. 31.</p>
        <p>Dining</p>
        <p>Bolton Landing's main street is lined with a number of friendly, informal restaurants, many featuring local seafood. Typical is Frederick's, 4970 Lakeshore Drive, (518) 644-3484, a favorite among local camp counselors, who congregate there for late-night suppers. The wraparound porch, which affords a good view of the main street, is especially pleasant on summer evenings. A dinner for two that included grilled salmon, linguine marinara, ahuge platter of nachos, a couple of pina coladas and dessert came to $60, including tip.</p>
