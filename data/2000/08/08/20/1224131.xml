        <p>Long Island has long had a deeply uneasy and sometimes bizarrely suspicious relationship with the scientific enterprises that have taken root on its shores.</p>
        <p>A deadly disease was sure to escape from the Plum Island Animal Disease Center -- a mile off the eastern end of Long Island here. The genetics research at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory was sure to develop altered foods that would ruin people's health and the environment alike. If Brookhaven National Laboratory did not completely radiate Suffolk County, it was sure to cause a black hole that would pull everyone from Alec Baldwin to Amy Fisher in for good.</p>
        <p>Of course, the institutions themselves are partly to blame. Although it was confined to Plum Island, there was an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease there in 1978. Cold Spring, for its part, was a leader of the shadowy eugenics movement during the first half of the 20th century, propounding racist pseudoscientific human breeding theories. And a byproduct of Brookhaven's Nobel Prize-winning research was enough pollution in the area to make the federal government name the lab a Superfund site; the government also found that the lab should have done more to prevent, or at least detect, a leak of radioactive water that was discovered in 1996.</p>
        <p>It has become one of the great enduring battles of Long Island: finding an acceptable balance between the scientific institutions and a highly divergent population that mixes commuters and celebrities, baymen with moguls, pensioners and new homeowners. The arguments take on a special vehemence here, where conservatives and liberals are united by a radical environmentalism and a whole generation has cut its political teeth keeping the Shoreham nuclear power plant from opening after it was built at a cost of $5.5 billion.</p>
        <p>As a result, some laboratories now find themselves fighting against their own pasts. For institutions like Plum Island and Brookhaven, which are run by the federal government, it is more than a question of good neighborliness. If they fail to win support from the community, and the politicians who represent their areas, they will lose government financing and programs.</p>
        <p>Take Plum Island. Some neighbors like to paint it a latter-day island of Dr. Moreau, and they trade outlandish yarns about 50-foot chickens who scratch and peck there. Others have more carefully reasoned concerns about safety precautions at the lab, and its occasional requests to transport viruses or infected animals on and off the island. Recently, when the government proposed giving Plum Island the ability to study animal viruses that can be passed on to humans, those concerns boiled over. The plan was scuttled, for now.</p>
        <p>So David Huxsoll, the new director of Plum Island, which is run by the Department of Agriculture, said the relationship with the public would be a large part of his job description. And he has a radical plan to win community support: he wants to open up the long-isolated island to guided tours.</p>
        <p>The proposal has met with, well, mixed reactions. ''Visit Toxic World -- A New Day of Fun Dawns at the Plum Island Animal Disease Center,'' was the headline of one mocking article in Dan's Papers, a weekly Hamptons institution.</p>
        <p>A similar ''see for yourself'' approach is employed farther west, in Upton, at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. Its director, John H. Marburger 3rd, is also trying to make up some of the goodwill that was lost before his watch began. To that end, he has invited more local civic groups -- including critics -- onto panels about the lab, has briefed more community organizations and has continued to hold open houses about research projects.</p>
        <p>Given the lab's past, it can still be a very hard sell, and one that some scientists worry is undermined by a fear or distrust of science itself.</p>
        <p>''The public has never been more dependent on science, and yet the public has never been more distrustful of science,'' said Dr. Robert P. Crease, an associate professor of philosophy at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, who is working on the second volume of a history of Brookhaven National Laboratory.</p>
        <p>In some cases the fear originates  with fringe groups that spread odd conspiracy theories worthy of ''The X-Files,'' like a book called ''The Montauk Project'' that is cited by people who insist that the Army experimented with space aliens in Montauk during World War II.</p>
        <p>But the fear also manifests itself in groups closer to the mainstream that are worried about the environment and children's health and concerned by what they consider a cavalier and sometimes misleading attitude on the part of scientists in the past.</p>
        <p>This is not just found on Long Island. A report on the topic released recently by the British House of Lords warned that ''public unease, mistrust and occasional outright hostility are breeding a climate of deep anxiety among scientists.''</p>
        <p>Some scientists warn that this view is too simplistic. As Dr. Marburger, the director of Brookhaven, said, ''Parents still want their children to learn about science, and they are not unhappy if their children become scientists or engineers.''</p>
        <p>But for institutions that are dependent on public financing, any loss  of confidence is a dangerous thing. Brookhaven is a case in point.</p>
        <p>The 5,300-acre laboratory, which employs 3,200 people, is less famous these days for its groundbreaking research and its Nobel Prize winners than for its recent environmental problems. Built in 1947 on what was then a fairly remote stretch of the Island, the laboratory conducted its research for many years unchecked by environmental laws. By the end of the cold war, the site was so polluted with industrial solvents, pesticides and radioactive waste that it was declared a federal Superfund site.</p>
        <p>Its recent troubles began in late 1996, when laboratory officials announced that they had discovered a plume of radioactive tritium leaking from its High Flux Beam Reactor. The leak, and the discovery of official inaction that had prevented it from being detected earlier, led the government to dismiss the organization that had run the lab for 50 years. The lab also shut down the reactor -- temporarily, officials thought.</p>
        <p>News of the leaking tritium -- a radioactive isotope of hydrogen --  galvanized civic groups in Suffolk County. Organizations like Standing for Truth About Radiation, an East Hampton antinuclear group which  features celebrities like Mr. Baldwin and the model Christie Brinkley on its board, mobilized to shut the reactor down. Some advocacy groups claimed, without hard evidence, that the lab was spreading cancer.</p>
        <p>Soon the cause was taken up by politicians. Representative Michael P. Forbes, who represents the area, and Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato joined forces to keep federal dollars from being used to restart the reactor. It was a significant break from the past, when elected officials deferred to scientists when making policy decisions about the lab and took pride in sending money for new projects home to their districts.</p>
        <p>Scientists, meanwhile, grumbled that the elected officials were bowing to the will of uninformed lay people and Hamptons celebrities to earn political mileage.</p>
        <p>Representative Forbes said in an interview that he lobbied to shut down the reactor for the good of the neighbors and the laboratory. ''I was concerned that an effort would be launched to shut down the lab completely if the problem wasn't addressed,'' he said. ''This was like a tourniquet -- close the reactor, stop the bleeding, save the laboratory.''</p>
        <p>The reactor was shut down permanently in November 1999 by the Department of Energy, which oversees the lab. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said the decision was made for economic reasons, not environmental ones.</p>
        <p>Dr. Steven Shapiro, who used the reactor for his physics research for 30 years, said that he felt betrayed.</p>
        <p>''It is partly science's fault,'' he said. ''Scientists probably haven't done a very good job of outreach to the public. And celebrities naturally have an audience -- they're beautiful people, they have an aura that scientists definitely don't have. They're much better looking than me. But what's disturbing is that they're being taken as authorities.''</p>
        <p>Concerns about the lab's nuclear reactor paled in comparison with the next accusation that was hurled at Brookhaven: that it was creating a doomsday machine.</p>
        <p>This accusation surfaced in 1999 in an article in The Sunday Times of London, which suggested that the lab's crowning new glory -- its Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, which smashes together the nuclei of very heavy atoms at nearly the speed of light -- could destroy the world.</p>
        <p>Then an article in Scientific American magazine raised the possibility that the collider could create a black hole. Once again groups protested, and a lawsuit was filed to keep it from opening. Once again the lab was deluged with e-mail messages and phone calls. But it managed to collide two beams of gold ions.</p>
        <p>''The world did not end,'' said Thomas Ludlam, a scientist who works on the collider.</p>
        <p>If Brookhaven has long been a flashpoint, Cold Spring, by contrast, has enjoyed rather low-key relations with its neighbors.</p>
        <p>Then, this summer, a cornfield was vandalized -- the very field where the late Barbara McClintock did her Nobel Prize-winning research on corn to learn about genes. A militant environmental group claimed responsibility, saying it was taking a strike against genetically modified foods. (The lab, clearly shaken, responded that the corn was naturally bred, not genetically altered, but said little else for fear of encouraging copycat crimes.)</p>
        <p>It is in this highly charged atmosphere that Dr. Huxsoll, the new director of Plum Island, now finds himself. To try to convince his neighbors of the benefit of the work the lab does, he said, he hopes to open a visitors center on Orient Point where people can watch video displays about the importance of studying foot-and-mouth disease, and the economic ravages that would be caused if there was an outbreak of it.</p>
        <p>But there have already been bumps in the road. A plan to bring in the carcasses of several hundred sheep that are believed to be infected with a variant of mad cow disease ran into significant local opposition. And many neighbors are still angry over the way the government tried to upgrade the laboratory to Biosafety Level Four in 1999, giving it the ability to study diseases that animals can give to humans, without seeking community reaction.</p>
        <p>Representative Forbes successfully lobbied the Clinton administration to remove the financing for the upgrade from the budget. But the Agriculture Department still wants to upgrade Plum Island.</p>
        <p>Dr. Huxsoll said he still hoped to win the community over.</p>
