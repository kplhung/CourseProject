        <p>The field made its run at Tiger Woods today, and for once, he did not run away.</p>
        <p>The course record was set, and Woods didn't do it. When Woods built a three-shot lead, he couldn't hold it. And as the P.G.A. Championship headed toward the final round, at least 10 players had a legitimate chance to win it.</p>
        <p>Shooting a two-under-par 70, his worst round of the tournament, Woods held a one-stroke lead at 13 under par (203) over Scott Dunlap and Bob May after today's unpredictable third round at Valhalla Golf Club. J. P. Hayes, who shot a 68, was two strokes off the lead at 11 under par, while Greg Chalmers was at 10 under par. Jose Maria Olazabal, who set the course record with a 63, was tied at nine under par with Stuart Appleby and Thomas Bjorn.</p>
        <p>All those players, and even some further behind, will enter Sunday with a chance to win the year's final major. And today's unexpected story was Woods's inability to take command in his quest to become the first player since Ben Hogan in 1953 to win three consecutive major championships. Valhalla was ripe for the taking, and while many players took advantage, Woods struggled. However, if you had told Woods on Thursday that he would have a one-stroke lead Saturday night, he would have been happy. So he looked forward to Sunday.</p>
        <p>''To shoot a 70 as poorly as I struck it and as badly as I played, I'll take it,'' said Woods, who hopes to become the first back-to-back P.G.A. winner since Denny Shute in 1936 and '37. ''Tomorrow is going to be quite a challenge, but I hope to come out and play well. It's going to be exciting for me, as well as the other guys in contention.''</p>
        <p>All over the course today, players had a birdie feast, and P.G.A. Championship records were set for most under-par rounds (53) and the lowest single-round scoring average (71.0). Roars rang out around the course, as one putt after another dropped into the cup, and one approach shot after another flirted with the flagstick. But Woods's putting was inconsistent, as were his approach shots. And with each missed chance that Woods squandered, the field drew closer.</p>
        <p>Who expected Woods's closest competition to come from three players who have never won on tour -- Dunlap, May and Chalmers -- and Hayes, who has one Tour victory? When Woods has a three-shot lead at a major, he usually steps on the opposition's throats. But when Woods went for the jugular today, he slipped.</p>
        <p>''I think he's close enough to be netted,'' Appleby said. ''Hopefully, all the boys can gather together and maybe put some heat on him, and someone can jump out of the pack.''</p>
        <p>May will be paired in Sunday's final group with Woods, a situation that Dunlap handled well today. Will May do the same?</p>
        <p>''It's going to be a great learning experience, but there is not a whole bunch of pressure on me,'' said May, who made seven birdies and just one bogey today. ''I am not supposed to win tomorrow. He is. At least that is the way everyone looks at it. That is fine with me.''</p>
        <p>Woods's erratic play left the door open for many others. He made a rare and costly double-bogey at No. 12, three-putting from 15 feet, including a missed second putt from less than 2 feet. Suddenly, the three-shot lead that he took to the 12th tee was gone, because Dunlap then birdied at No. 12 to tie Woods.</p>
        <p>Dunlap, who shot a 70, refused to fold even when he fell three strokes behind. He ended the day with a brilliant bunker shot at 18 to within 3 feet of the cup that led to a birdie.</p>
        <p>''There's going to be pressure on everyone tomorrow,'' Dunlap said. ''Tiger's pressure is going for a place in the record book. The pressure on Bob and myself will be the pressure of getting a first win on tour, let alone a major.''</p>
        <p>The day's most shocking moment came at No. 12, when Woods double-bogeyed. He doesn't make many double-bogeys in majors anymore. He never made one at this year's United States Open or British Open.</p>
        <p>But today, the momentum changed swiftly at No. 12. Woods hit a poor tee shot into the left rough, then his second shot landed short of the green. After Woods chipped to 15 feet, the gallery was shocked to see him miss not only his first putt, which slid 2 feet past the hole, but his second putt, which darted past the right edge of the cup.</p>
        <p>Dunlap capitalized by making an 8-foot birdie putt that pulled him even with Woods. Even after Dunlap bogeyed the par-3 No. 14 to give Woods a one-stroke lead again, Woods continued to struggle, bogeying No. 15 to fall back into a tie. Woods's approach shot at No. 15 sailed over the green into heavy rough, and though he hit a brilliant chip out of heavy grass to 10 feet, he followed by missing the putt for par.</p>
        <p>Dunlap made another bogey at No. 17, missing a 15-foot putt for par after missing the green on his second shot, but both Woods and Dunlap birdied the par-5 finishing hole. Woods two-putted after reaching the green in two shots, while Dunlap hit a superb bunker shot on his third shot at 18 that stopped 3 feet from the cup.</p>
        <p>Woods looked to be in prime position midway through the round, when Dunlap started to look shaky with his putter. Dunlap could have tied Woods at No. 8 but missed a 3-foot putt for birdie. At No. 9, Woods made a 15-foot putt for birdie, then Dunlap missed a 10-foot putt for birdie to fall two strokes behind. And at No. 10, Woods made a 4-footer for birdie to go three strokes ahead after Dunlap missed an 8-footer for birdie.</p>
        <p>At that point, you could hear people thinking that Woods was about to pull away, but it did not happen.</p>
        <p>Woods is still the man to beat, though. He had to grind to win last year's P.G.A. Championship, holding off Sergio Garcia to win by a stoke. Perhaps Sunday someone will rise up from the pack to beat the world's No. 1 player, or perhaps Woods will do what he usually does -- play his best when the pressure is greatest.</p>
        <p>''There's a lot of players out there, which is going to make it even more fun to go out and have a challenge like that,'' Woods said. ''I'm going to have a good time tomorrow.''</p>
