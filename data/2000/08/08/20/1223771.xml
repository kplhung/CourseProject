        <p>ON a standing-room-only Amtrak train from New England to New York, I recently found myself nose to chest with a fellow passenger wearing a Hosteling International card on a lanyard around his neck. The lavaliere reminded me that youth migrations are upon us, as students flock back to college.</p>
        <p>Like senior citizens, students are a group that transportation companies want to attract, hoping that they will fill seats at times that business travelers do not: Saturdays, for example, or Tuesday mornings. AirTran, a discount airline with a hip conversational Web page for youth standby travel, www.airtran.com/deals, delineates the week with its Best Days to Fly Standby chart. Its message:</p>
        <p>Sunday: No Way</p>
        <p>Monday: Way</p>
        <p>Tuesday: Most Excellent</p>
        <p>Wednesday Most Excellent</p>
        <p>Thursday: Not Quite Excellent</p>
        <p>Friday: No Way</p>
        <p>Saturday: Somewhat Excellent</p>
        <p>AirTran serves 31 cities using DC-9 and 737 jets. Most of its service is  east of the Mississippi. The standby plan, in operation two years, is simple. Anyone age 18 to 22, student or not, can fly standby for $47 a segment -- a flight with one takeoff and one landing -- whenever there are seats, but never on Friday, Sunday or holidays, including Labor Day weekend and Thanksgiving. Tax and airport charges of up to $5.50 are extra.  A driver's license or similar official  photo ID must be presented, and  payment may be made by cash or credit card. AirTran's current program expires Dec. 14; if it follows last year's pattern, it will resume in January, a system that avoids what would be a long blackout, according to Sarah Duffin, a spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>There are two drawbacks: Almost all AirTran flights go through Atlanta, so getting from New York to Chicago is going to take two segments and quite a while. In addition, standbys cannot check luggage, so everything must be carried on. AirTran: (800) 247-8726.</p>
        <p>Trans World Airlines also has a basic plan, although not for standbys. It requires putting money up ahead of time. It sells Travel Pak coupons to students age 14 to 24 that are similar to senior books. A book, which costs $548, has four coupons, each good for a one-way flight in the lower 48 states, or from there to certain Caribbean and Canadian cities; most trips go through St. Louis. Segment taxes and airport charges are not included in the price. Two coupons are needed each way for  Hawaii or Alaska. The coupons are good for a year but not after the holder's 25th birthday; student identification and proof of age are required at the time of travel. T.W.A.: (800) 221-2000; www.twa.com.</p>
        <p>The Delta Shuttle sells travelers 12 to 24 years old (as well as those over 62) packs of four coupons for the heavily collegiate Boston-New York-Washington corridor. The hours of use are restricted: Travel is permitted only between 10:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. or 7:30 to 9:30 p.m. Monday to Friday, or anytime on Saturday and Sunday. Coupons for the short trips (Logan-La Guardia or La Guardia-Reagan) cost $232 for four or $413 for eight. For Logan-Reagan, the cost is $353 for four, $598 for eight. The prices do not include segment taxes and airport charges. Coupon books are valid for a year. They may be ordered on the phone, but must be picked up in person, with proof of age. Delta: (800) 221-1212.</p>
        <p>Membership programs involve discounts, but are full of wrinkles and caveats. American Express offers two types of cards to students: credit cards, which have no annual fee but require interest payments on unpaid balances, or charge cards, which cost $55 a year, on which the balance must be paid in full each month. American Express has linked up with Continental Airlines to offer student cardholders four domestic flights a year at prices starting at $119 for a weekday round trip to a destination up to 1,000 miles away and rising to $279 for a weekend trip of 4,000aux:dupe miles or more. An offer of discounts of $100 to $250 on 10 round-trip tickets a year to international destinations is also included; the year begins Sept. 6 and runs until Sept. 5, 2001. These fares require Saturday-night stays and involve blackout dates, and the tickets must be charged to the card. American Express: (800) 942-2639; on www .americanexpress.com, go to Visit Our Cards Center, then American Express Student Cards.</p>
        <p>Citibank has linked with American Airlines for its Citibank Platinum Select Card for College Students, a no-fee credit card. In the first year of membership, a student gets four certificates to buy domestic round-trip tickets that range from $139 to $299, depending on distance, plus one companion certificate. There are also three certificates for discounts for travel elsewhere, a discount of $100 to $250 on a ticket to Europe, for example. The process is slow. It takes three weeks to get a card; information on getting certificates comes four weeks later, and it take two to three weeks for certificates to be delivered. Saturday-night stays may be involved, as well as blackouts.</p>
        <p>The answers to frequently asked questions on Citibank's Web site (www.citibank.com) are quite clear, explaining, for example, what the prime rate is and how it is linked to interest on unpaid balances. Citibank: (800) 248-4226.</p>
        <p>United Airlines has a college-student frequent flier program, United College Plus, that has been sending its members coupons good for 15 percent off certain tickets. The program is in revision, according to marketing officials. A Web site for discounted fares has been folded into the frequent flier site. The program is linked to a college Visa credit card that earns one mile for every $2 spent. The minimum age is 18; www.collegeplus.com.</p>
        <p>Discount Card</p>
        <p>Student Advantage, a Boston company, sells a card for $20 a year, plus $2.50 shipping and handling, that provides a 15 percent discount on Amtrak and Greyhound walk-up bus fares. College and high school students, part-time or full-time graduate students and faculty members are eligible; Mark A. Egan, a spokesman, said that age was not a qualifier, only enrollment as a student. The card is sold on campuses, in college bookstores and through a lot of the merchants it is linked to, including Amtrak and Greyhound.</p>
        <p>The Amtrak Student Advantage discount applies to most national trains. In the Northeast Corridor, it may be used on Acela Regional trains, but Stephen Taubenkibel, an Amtrak spokesman, said the line had not decided if it would apply to the Acela Expresses, when they finally start operating. Some Metroliner trains are also excluded. There are blackout periods; advance ticketing or reservations may be required.</p>
        <p>At Greyhound, the 15 percent applies to walk-up fares, which are full fares. Different reductions may be available for buying in advance or for long circuits on the road, but the 15 percent does not apply to these. Student Advantage: 280 Summer Street, Boston, Mass. 02210; (877) 256-4672 or www.studentadvantage .com. Greyhound: (800) 231-2222; www.greyhound.com. Amtrak: (800) 962-6872; www.amtrak.com.</p>
        <p>For collegians packing all those belongings, Greyhound has a Student Advantage wrinkle worth a look: 50 percent off package shipping.</p>
