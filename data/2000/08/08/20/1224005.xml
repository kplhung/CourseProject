        <p>THERE isn't any construction going on at the New York Hall of Science, but you might be fooled into thinking so, given the bulky tool cart and orange flags roping off the Great Hall lobby. It's the Con Edison Millennium Manhole Cover Exhibition, through Sept. 3.</p>
        <p>In 1884 the city required all electrical wires and cables to be placed underground. As a result, gas and electric companies produced their own manhole cover designs, and many original covers are still in place. The Millennium Manhole exhibition includes a rubbing station where you can create your own cover designs, view the work of eight artists who competed in a millennium manhole cover competition and see the winning design, ''Global Energy'' by Karim Rashid.</p>
