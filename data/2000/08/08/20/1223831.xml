        <p>To the Editor: Regarding the article about in-flight heart emergencies ''Defibrillators: Airline Update'' (July 30): Before trying to send EKG's via satellite using seat-back phones, I suggest that the industry first make sure the phones are working and everyone is clear on how to make a call.</p>
        <p>On a recent American Airlines flight I needed to call home. There were no instructions on the phone instrument. The flight attendant told me that the instuctions were in the back of the in-flight magazine. After several minutes we jointly found the instructions, which ask the user to first push the ''on'' button. There was no button marked ''on,'' and the balance of the instructions were of little help. After enlisting the help of two other flight attendants, we concluded that the phone in my row probably did not work, but we were unable to verify this on other phones because  of poor labeling and operating instructions. This all took about 20 minutes. Sure glad it was not an emergency call.</p>
        <p>ROGER NEWELL  San Diego</p>
        <p>John Hotard of American Airlines responds: We are sorry Mr. Newell had trouble with the phone. There are two systems on our fleet at the moment and thus two sets of instructions. The instructions in American Way magazine, which he followed, were for the other type of phone. There is also a notation with those instructions that for certain other types of aircraft, the instructions are in the Entertainment Guide, also in the seatback pocket. While this is confusing at times, we found it more confusing to combine two sets of instructions.</p>
