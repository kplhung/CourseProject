        <p>ART might be made in solitude, but its purpose isn't really fulfilled until it is seen by others. Getting one's work shown has always been difficult or a matter of luck: being in the right place at the right time.</p>
        <p>No clear guidelines exist on how to get a curator to consider one's work. In an effort to let a little light in on the selection process,  the curators of contemporary art at five Connecticut institutions were asked how they go about making choices.</p>
        <p>''Everything we do is about Connecticut,'' said the curator Ann Smith of the Mattatuck Museum in Waterbury. ''This goes for historical as well as contemporary art. The museum has shown contemporary art for 25 years, but the 6 to 8 solo shows that used to be the norm have given way to 2 to 3 shows lasting longer and featuring several artists around a theme.''</p>
        <p>A recent show, ''Mysteries of the Earth,'' presented four printmakers whose subject was elemental nature. Ms. Smith said that the next such show, which is in the process of being selected, has to do with the city. ''I don't necessarily mean depictions of the city,'' she said. '' Artists and the City'' will include artists who might have internalized the city as well.''</p>
        <p>To help her find work that fits, Ms. Smith is aided by a a committee that includes artists. She also frequently judges competitions and makes mental notes of what she comes across. ''Geography,'' she said, ''which part of the state an artist comes from, is considered, but I also like to see artists at the beginning of promising careers.''</p>
        <p>She is acutely aware of the problems that artists face in exhibiting. ''There is so much art that deserves to be seen, and in Waterbury there is so much space, in the form of empty buildings. I can imagine bringing them together and giving Waterbury a few different kinds of alternative art spaces.''</p>
        <p>The plum of contemporary art spaces has to be Matrix at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford. Matrix is 25 years old and many important and influential artists have participated in it. Its curator, Nicholas Baume, said he was looking for ''artists who are at a point in their career at which a Matrix show will take them to the next highest level.''</p>
        <p>''Therefore,'' he added, ''we're not age-specific, and a long career record isn't a requirement. In the beginning, any curator in the museum could do a show and there was even one featuring the German Expressionist Ernst Kirchner who died in 1938. In those days Matrix might show more than one person at a time as long as each artist occupied one room of the Matrix gallery by himself. Over the years the program evolved into mostly one-person shows by living artists.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Baume has been at his post for a year and a half, after moving from his native Australia. He observed that ''20 years ago a Matrix artist would simply show his most recent work; that has changed.''</p>
        <p>''One thing I look for in selecting artists is what the Atheneum, which has historically presented avant-garde art, can do better than anyone else,'' he added. ''For example, our current show, 'Autobody,' has the support of the local Yellow Cab Company. The photographed torsos of a couple of cabbies are wrapped around a couple of taxis. The idea is that it's an extension of the body of the driver, which is usually isolated.''</p>
        <p>''Our next show,'' Mr. Baume said, ''incorporates Hartford, too. Christian Jankowski, who I discovered at the Venice Biennale, had never heard of Matrix, but he's doing a project based on the 25 years of Matrix's history. His first idea was to do something with the insurance industry. His theory was that insurance is about avoiding risks, while artists take risks.''</p>
        <p>''The project he's actually doing, called 'The Matrix Effect,' will be a videotape. Questions have been put to Andrea Miller-Keller who was Matrix curator for most of its history, and to many of the artists who have been in the program, and responses are coming in by e-mail and other ways. But in the video local children from 8 to 10 years old will play all the artists. They'll answer the questions. Jankowski's idea is that avant-garde art keeps people young.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Baume said that his exhibition proposals are presented to his colleagues and discussed. ''Collegial is the way I'd describe the process,'' he said. ''I also find that there is financial support for our programs, even though government help is shrinking. There seems to be this idea in America, that if it's a brilliant new idea, we'll support it.''</p>
        <p>Finally, he said, ''We pay our artists a fee. The main reason for this is that the work in their project isn't usually saleable. There's a trend in museums that if an expensive work, such as a video costing tens of thousands of dollars, gets sold, the artist reimburses the sponsoring museum what they paid him, but we haven't encountered that situation yet.''</p>
        <p>Sending in a sheet of slides is an obvious way to try to get a curator's attention, but most curators say they get such a flood of slides that they're impossible to deal with. An exception is Paul Clabby, who directs the John Slade Ely House in New Haven. ''We will accept from 10 to 20 slides from anybody,'' he said. ''A really big help to me has been a committee, which has several artist members. We project the slides on a regular basis and discuss them.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clabby said that he is quite good at retaining an image in his head. ''Slides have been known to sit for 15 years before they're chosen for a show,'' he said. ''My recent show that had the house as its theme is a specific example that comes to mind. Frank Gardner's work based on the different textures of items commonly found around the house was work I first saw 10 years ago. We do a lot of theme shows; often the idea for a show comes first and then we choose art to fit the idea.'' ''Increasingly, artists are chosen by word of mouth, or by being in a group show where someone sees their work,'' Mr. Clabby added.</p>
        <p>He said that he prefers to put on ''cutting edge shows'' and one reason for this might be to make a contrast with Ely House's other programs. Half the exhibition schedule is given to New Haven organizations that specialize in more traditional art, such as the Paint and Clay Club, which has held an annual exhibition since 196l, the Eli House's first year of operations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clabby is going to observe the anniversary with a show next year that will commemorate the Ely House's 40th anniversary. ''I have just made the decision to focus only on the last 15 years,'' he said. ''When I was researching, a lot of the work from earlier years didn't impress me. The artists who will be in my show can submit old and new pieces.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clabby is warming to the Internet as a way to find art. ''Now that we have a D.S.L. connection,'' he said, ''I can see using the Internet a lot.''</p>
        <p>Ken Marchione, who is the art curator at the Stamford Museum and Nature Center, is an artist himself.  His own experience doubtless helps him know what to look for when choosing shows for Art-X, the museum's gallery devoted in solo shows by living artists from the region, which includes Westchester County as well as southern Connecticut.</p>
        <p>He operates by having an idea of what the gallery should show next, in order to vary the shows. ''For example,'' Mr. Marchione said, ''right now an artist who uses thick paint, Ann Low, is going to be followed by Ralph Loomin, a photographer of industrial sites. I look for an artist who is in a groove and showing consistency. But at the same time when I decide on a show I often try to show how much diversity there is in one phase of an artist's work.</p>
        <p>''I have a long list of potential artists, about half of it is on the computer and half in my head. If I have an idea about what I want to show, but lack the artist, I will frequently bring it up in casual conversation with other artists, mainly. Within two or three days I usually have an answer. But unsolicited material, such as a sheet of slides, usually receives a only a nice letter in return.''</p>
        <p>Finally, Mr. Marchione said, ''I go to shows in New York, mainly to see that what I'm showing isn't too out of line with what's current. I also make studio visits. Artists don't have any idea how revealing such a visit is. Most important to me is that I can see if they're making a breakthrough. I might use the Internet more if we had a faster connection. But it takes so long to download an image from an artist's Web site.'' He added that it was good, however, for communicating with artists when planning a show.</p>
        <p>''Choosing contemporary art is perhaps more complex for us than for other institutions,'' said Nancy Hall-Duncan of the Bruce Museum in Greenwich. ''Those places that show it regularly have already passed the first level of decision making,'' she said. ''We have to decide whether or when to show contemporary art, because the Bruce's mission is to create a good mix.'' Perhaps 10 percent of the Bruce's schedule, which can include as many as 16 art exhibitions a year, has been devoted to contemporary art.</p>
        <p>In the summer of 1998, the Bruce showed photographs by Shirin Neshat, an Iranian-American. ''She was suggested by a board member because her art is powerful, both visually and conceptually,'' Ms. Hall-Duncan said. ''It is about both Iran itself, and the position of women in Iran. I read the little that had been written on her at that point'' -- she was one of the major artists at the Whitney Biennial this year -- ''and then I went to her studio in New York. We were in a lot of contact after that.'' ''There's a treasure hunt aspect to putting together a show,'' Ms. Hall-Duncan said. ''It's not linear. For example, doing this show, 'The Women of Allah,' involved writing a grant proposal to the N.E.A.''</p>
        <p>This spring the Bruce showed the paintings of Kathryn Myers, who has a studio in New York and who teaches at the University of Connecticut at Storrs. Ms. Hall-Duncan described Ms. Myers as a realist painter ''with a lot of intrigue.''</p>
        <p>''We go way back,'' Ms. Hall-Duncan said, adding that Ms. Myers was in the Connecticut biennial the Bruce did in 1991. Ms. Hall-Duncan noted that the Internet is good for research, but, she said, ''I make studio visits when I'm trying to develop a particular idea. I learn a lot by seeing original work, and by talking to artists to find out how they feel and think -- what their reasons are for making art.''</p>
