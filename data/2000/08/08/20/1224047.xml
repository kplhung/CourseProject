        <p>ALTHOUGH still under the shadows of a government investigation into its billing practices, HCA-The Healthcare Corporation, the nation's largest hospital chain, made a successful foray into the debt markets on Friday.</p>
        <p>Strong investor demand allowed  HCA, formerly called the Columbia/ HCA Healthcare Corporation, to increase the size of its issue by 50 percent, to $750 million.</p>
        <p>The debt offering was a key test of whether HCA had regained the trust of investors, and apparently it had:  they placed more than $2 billion in orders for the 10-year notes. It was also a test of whether the for-profit health care industry was recovering after years in critical care.</p>
        <p>The reception that investors gave the HCA issue added to evidence from the stock market that it is. Shares of publicly traded hospital companies have soared this year, even as the overall stock market has stumbled on concerns about rising interest rates and slowing corporate growth.</p>
        <p>Kathleen F. Lamb, a high-yield health care analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, called the market hot for hospital credit issues. ''Issuers not taking advantage of this are asleep at the wheel,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Through underwriters led by Chase Securities and Goldman, Sachs, HCA priced 10-year senior unsecured notes at 99.53 to yield 8.821 percent, or about 305 basis points  more than a 10-year Treasury note with a comparable maturity. (A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.) Price talk ahead of the sale was of a spread over Treasuries of 312.5 to 325 basis points. The notes, which were given an 8.75 percent coupon, have a maturity date of Sept. 1, 2010.</p>
        <p>HCA, based in Nashville, is considered a bellwether in the hospital industry. It initially planned to issue two maturities but settled on one. Moody's Investors Services rated the 10-year note Ba-2, its second-highest junk grade. The Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation gave it a low investment grade, BB+.</p>
        <p>Stephen Carter, senior market analyst at MCM CorporateWatch, a research firm, said the deal included a make-whole call provision. ''In effect what this means is that the issue is essentially noncallable because the price is so high and will only be called if Treasury yields move significantly lower and it makes economic sense to do so,'' he said. ''This is a regular feature on many investment grade and upper-level-rated high-yield bond issues.''</p>
        <p>HCA said the proceeds from the financing would be used for general corporate purposes including repayment of bank debt. In May, the company agreed to pay $745 million in civil penalties to settle part of a broad government inquiry into whether its success was achieved in part by cheating federal health programs.</p>
        <p>Still, criminal and other civil investigations that have long been at the heart of the case remain unresolved. They concern whether the company's hospitals fraudulently overstated expenses to increase reimbursement from Medicare and other federal health programs and engaged in illegal financial relationships with doctors. Under the terms of the partial settlement, both Columbia and the government are under pressure to resolve the entire case before the end of this year.</p>
        <p>THE debt sale last week represented the company's first trip to the bond market since 1997, when government agents raided the company's offices and hospitals in seven states, seizing documents. Last year, under the old corporate name, HCA tried to sell $250 million of shorter-maturity securities, but withdrew before they could sell, citing market conditions.</p>
        <p>Amid the government's investigation, the hospital chain has changed its name and installed a strong new management team to the delight of some portfolio managers. It has also improved its balance sheet by shedding 140 hospitals from a peak of 340 in 1997 and reduced its debt by about $2.4 billion, to just a little less than $7 billion, trimmed costs and bargained for better terms with private insurers who pay patient bills.</p>
        <p>In addition to HCA, a large number of other companies issued debt last week, selling over $12 billion in investment grade securities, according to MCM CorporateWatch.</p>
