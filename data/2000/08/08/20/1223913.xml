        <p>MARGARET FULLER, manager of profit sharing at 7-Eleven Inc., is proud that three-quarters of the company's nearly 15,000 eligible employees now participate in its 401(k) retirement savings plan. Three years ago, only half had signed up.</p>
        <p>The big increase wasn't caused by a surge in the company's matching contribution or a change in the plan's investment offerings. All it took was a bow to human nature.</p>
        <p>Instead of leaving it up to employees to complete enrollment forms and return them -- and having many of them procrastinate or shy away --  7-Eleven started enrolling employees automatically on the first anniversary of their hiring; only those who want to opt out of participation needed to lift a finger.</p>
        <p>The company, based in Dallas, is  one of about 50 large corporations that have begun automatic enrollment in recent years, as many other employers waited for the federal government to take a stand on the practice. Last month, however, regulators in two federal departments gave it a solid go-ahead, and the Internal Revenue Service announced several rulings clarifying the automatic-enrollment ground rules for businesses, nonprofit organizations and school systems.</p>
        <p>In a joint statement, Labor Secretary Alexis M. Herman and Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers said they saw automatic enrollment as a ''promising method of encouraging participation by those who disproportionately have been missing the benefits of a regular, disciplined  approach to retirement saving,'' meaning the many younger and lower-paid workers who put off saving for retirement because they feel they cannot spare any of their pay.</p>
        <p>In fact, experts say, most people cannot afford not to contribute to the plans. Even if the current Social Security system is maintained indefinitely, the dwindling of traditional, defined-benefit pension plans means that few workers can count on a financially secure retirement without putting aside money of their own.</p>
        <p>Hewitt Associates, a benefits research firm in Lincolnshire, Ill., estimates that three-fourths of eligible American workers are enrolled in 401(k) plans. But that still leaves millions of Americans without any retirement savings program.</p>
        <p>David Wray, president of the Profit Sharing/401(k) Council of America in Chicago, said he expected the number of companies using automatic enrollment to double annually for the next five years, and that more than half of all plans would use the method by 2005. In addition, the new I.R.S. rulings make it possible to automatically enroll all workers, not just new hires, in 401(k) plans and their close cousins, 403(b)'s (for public schools and charities) and 457(b)'s (for state and local government workers).</p>
        <p>In automatic enrollment, the initial percentage of pay to be set aside  is left to the employer's discretion. (7-Eleven's plan sets aside 3 percent of gross pay, a typical rate, and the company matches employee contributions at 36 cents on the dollar.)</p>
        <p>Employers also decide how the money will initially be invested. According to Mark Iwry, the benefits tax counsel for the Treasury Department, employers are encouraged to put savings of automatic enrollees into a balanced fund, rather than a more risky stock fund or a low-return money market fund. ''The plans are typically very careful in the investments they select for employees,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Once enrolled, employees are generally free to select different rates and investment vehicles according to plan rules.</p>
        <p>The experience of 7-Eleven shows that automatic sign-up can go a long way toward closing the enrollment gap for lower-paid employees -- an important issue for all participants, because federal rules sharply restrict benefits for top earners if too few of their lower-paid co-workers take part.</p>
        <p>Still, some critics wonder whether herding uninterested workers into the plans accomplishes much in the long run. ''The government is leading the horse to water, but they haven't focused on teaching them to want to drink,'' said Ric Edelman, an author and financial planner in Fairfax, Va. He cited Hewitt statistics  showing that fewer than one-third of people who leave jobs with 401(k)'s roll over the money into individual retirement accounts; the remainder simply pocket -- and pay taxes on -- the cash payout from the plans.</p>
        <p>Other analysts worry that automatic enrollees will be too passive as savers. In a study of one company's workers, the National Bureau of Economic Research in Cambridge, Mass., found that most left their starting contribution rates unchanged and never moved out of the low-yielding money market fund in which the company put them.</p>
        <p>But Leslie Kramerich, an acting assistant labor secretary, said it was most important that the workers become savers in the first place. ''Once they get started, then we can tackle whether they're too conservative or too cautious,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Getting more workers involved in 401(k)'s makes the plans more effective as morale builders, employers say. Ben Goldstein, director of strategic human resource planning for Primex Technologies, an aerospace company in St. Petersburg, Fla., said that when his company's workers receive their quarterly 401(k) statements and see the 50 percent matching contribution from the company, they are more motivated to stay on. ''It's like free money,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, before Primex started using automatic enrollment, about 35 percent of workers took part in the plan; now four-fifths do, Mr. Goldstein said.</p>
        <p>STILL, some workers who are automatically enrolled in 401(k) plans ought to opt out, because even plans with generous matching rates are not the best choice for everyone, experts say.  Lower-paid people in their 20's and 30's may be better off putting their limited resources toward a down payment on a first home or paying off debts like college loans, said Robert Clark, professor of business and economics at North Carolina State University. And union officials say that however advantageous the plans might be, some of their members genuinely cannot spare the money.</p>
        <p>If workers decide to leave automatic-enrollment plans after the deductions have already begun from their paychecks, they face the same early-withdrawal penalties that other 401(k) members do: 10 percent of the balance, plus income tax. But Ms. Fuller of 7-Eleven said few workers had complained about being unwittingly swept into the company's plan. ''When they get the statement at the end of the quarter,'' she said, ''they're usually very happy.''</p>
