        <p>Renaissance Cruises, after an inquiry by the New York State attorney general, has changed its cancellation penalties to bring them into line with those of other cruise companies.</p>
        <p>Renaissance formerly required full payment for a cruise 120 days before sailing and kept the whole amount if the passenger canceled even 119 days in advance. Starting with bookings made last Tuesday, the line changed its policy to allow cancellation with no penalty up to 76 days before sailing; it now exacts a 100 percent penalty only for cancellation 14 days ahead.</p>

        <p>Renaissance Cruises, after an inquiry by the New York State attorney general, has changed its cancellation penalties to bring them into line with those of other cruise companies.</p>
        <p>Renaissance formerly required full payment for a cruise 120 days before sailing and kept the whole amount if the passenger canceled even 119 days in advance. Starting with bookings made last Tuesday, the line changed its policy to allow cancellation with no penalty up to 76 days before sailing; it now exacts a 100 percent penalty only for cancellation 14 days ahead.</p>
        <p>In a consent decree signed by Renaissance on Aug. 3, Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer of New York said that it appeared that under the old policy, a consumer who canceled a cruise sustained a loss that ''may not reasonably reflect Renaissance's actual damages and consequently, may violate the consumer protection laws of this state.'' In the decree, Renaissance disputed this, and acknowledged no wrongdoing.</p>
        <p>The earlier cancellation penalties caused major travel insurance companies -- Access America, CSA Travel Protection, Travel Guard, Travel Insurance Services and Travelex -- to stop covering passengers who bought Renaissance cruises. Renaissance's position had been was that its high volume of passengers kept prices low and it therefore had to have strict policies.</p>
        <p>Under another change, effective Sept. 4, the line will require full payment 90 days in advance, rather than 120 days. This is fully refundable up to 76 days before sailing. From 75 days to 45 days, the line keeps 25 percent of the fare; from 44 to 15 days, 50 percent, and after 14 days, the whole amount.</p>
        <p>The insurance companies appear ready to resume insuring Renaissance, and the line has announced that agents offering its cruises will be able to sell cancellation  coverage through the Berkely Group.</p>
