        <p>CARL JOHNSON is a master carver. He carves dragons, acanthus leaves, relief sculptures, even gnomes and trolls. The retired engineer from Colts Neck has spent years perfecting the craft of Scandinavian carving, each draw of his blade a tribute to his Swedish -- and his wife's Norwegian -- ancestry.</p>
        <p>Come the Sunday of Labor Day weekend, Mr. Johnson will take his knives and latest carvings to Stanhope for the 16th annual Scandinavian Fest. There, among others of similar heritage, he'll show off his work, stopping occasionally to regale fans with a bit of folklore about his most popular items. ''The gnomes are the good guys,'' he said. ''The trolls are the bad guys with ugly long noses and tails. The gnomes, if you treat them nice, give them milk and cookies, they'll come out at night and make everything nice for you.''</p>
        <p>The Randlane dancers of Lakewood are also getting ready for the big day. Once a week, 21 men, women and children have been meeting to practice the high-stepping routines that characterize the folk dances of Estonia, the small Nordic nation near the Baltic Sea that shares a linguistic heritage with Finland. The residents of Lakewood, an Ocean County haven for Estonian immigrants since before World War II, are also spiffing up the clothes they'll wear: colorful tunics, nine-foot-long hand-woven belts, pleated skirts and exquisite jewelry. And they're practicing their tricky footwork to perform tail dances, contra dances, waltzes, mazurkas and polkas. ''The object is mostly to get airborne,'' said Karin Lichter, 57, a librarian and local historian whose parents were Estonian. ''You want to get off the ground.''</p>
        <p>ScanFest, as it is also called, celebrates the customs of the world's six Nordic countries: Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. Budd Lake had been the site of the festival for a decade; increasing crowds forced a shift six years ago to Waterloo Village.</p>
        <p>Fairgoers come for all the reasons people go to summer fairs: for T-shirts, arts and crafts, an endless melody of music and an equally inexhaustible supply of snacks.</p>
        <p>What sets this festival apart from so many summer events is its truly international stature. Performers and vendors from several nations make a showing, catch up with old friends and forge important business ties. And yet it is still largely a New Jersey event. Fully 80 percent of the organizers' mailing list, or about 8,000 people, live in New Jersey. But whether they've driven from Morristown, or hopped a plane from Oslo to Newark, fairgoers come to connect with something that is their own. ''Everyone is looking for their roots,'' said Jette Bjerg, a Danish cook who runs Scandia Foods, a successful mail-order and catering business in Dover. ''We all come from somewhere, this is such a young country.''</p>
        <p>Most Americans know Scandinavians settled much of the Midwestern and Plains states in the 19th century, a migration celebrated in the works of Willa Cather. But Swedes settled the Delaware Valley as early as 1638, in what is now Wilmington, Del. They formed the first European government in North America, only to be defeated by the Dutch and British in 1651. ''That's why you and I speak English and not Swedish,'' said Leif Biderman, a ScanFest organizer, importer, and amateur historian based in Philadelphia. The defeated Swedes spread to New Jersey.</p>
        <p>One defeated group built a fort near what is now Salem, but didn't stay long. ''They were defeated not by the English or Dutch but by the mosquitoes,'' said Mr. Biderman. Numerous Garden State towns -- like the obvious Swedesboro -- owe their history to these settlers.</p>
        <p>This year's event is doubly significant because the year 2000 marks the 1,000th anniversary of Leif Ericsson's landing at L'Anse aux Meadows, Newfoundland. The Vikings were the common ancestor of the Nordic peoples. In fact, festival organizers today use Old Norse alphabet characters, or runes, on all their literature. Throughout the year, Nordic peoples are celebrating the Viking landfall. In the United States, the Smithsonian is sponsoring an exhibition including a catalog, Web site, television documentary and educational programming to explore the origins and impact of this moment in history.</p>
        <p>Eight people from the Baltimore area are traveling to Stanhope this year to recreate a Viking encampment on the grounds of Waterloo. And though the waters of the Musconetcong River, which flow through Waterloo, are not exactly navigable by large ships, they will play host to the 20-foot long Gyrfalcon, a reproduction of the smallest of the ninth-century ships. Looking like ''a rowboat with a thyroid problem,'' as one re-enactor put it, the Gyrfalcon will ply the waters outfitted with an 80-square-foot sail and a five-man crew.</p>
        <p>''We want people to come away with an understanding of this culture and to know that they didn't look like Hagar,'' said Judy Mitchell, a 40-year-old massage therapist who at festival time dons Viking dress and weaves baskets. ''They were very sophisticated for their time. Women could inherit property. They permitted divorce, and there were laws against spouse beating.''</p>
        <p>In order to get through all this -- the Vikings and carvers, the dancers, musicians and singers performing on five different stages, Susan Keenan's Danish bobbin lacing and Lavinia Trimmer's Hardanger embroidery demonstrations -- one must eat, and eat well.</p>
        <p>And eat Scandinavian. Sure, you'll be able to get a pizza and cheese fries, but why would you? Not when there are lingonberries, limpa (a crisp bread), lefse (potato pastry) and lapskaus (a stew). One entertainer last year noted, ''I never enjoyed so much good food I couldn't pronounce.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Bjerg of Dover worked in a deli in Denmark as a young girl and emigrated to New Jersey in 1967, she said, with one mission: ''To show Americans what a real deli should be like.'' In her booth, she'll be serving fiskekaker, Norwegian fish cakes with a brown sauce, and Swedish rullepolse, or cold cuts. But the big draw will be frikadeller, Danish meat patties. ''You know what a meatball and meatloaf taste like?'' she said. ''This is much better -- fried, then baked with a little sauce.''</p>
        <p>No Scandinavian festival would be complete without a smorgasbord. The fair equivalent is set out by the Swedish Women's Educational Association: limpa bread, cheese, herring, hard-boiled eggs, boiled potatoes, meatballs and lingonberries. Breakfast will be a Swedish braid, a sweet and doughy almond bread. ''Last year it rained and everyone stood so nicely and patiently in the rain and we sold out,'' recalled Anita Rhodes, a Swedish-born association member who now lives in Chester. ''Selling out in the rain was the ultimate compliment.''</p>
        <p>The mind behind all this food is Mr. Biderman, a Swedish businessman and importer who came to the United States 15 years ago. Each year he lives for the dining choices at the ScanFest, making do otherwise with snacks at a Philadelphia-area Ikea, where he teaches a Swedish class once a week.</p>
        <p>Seeking authenticity in cuisine, he has worked to persuade even the most American vendors to go native. A pizza maker, for example, was talked into selling quattro stagione pizza, a favorite in Sweden (where it is made with tomato, cheese, ham, mushrooms, shrimp and mussels). A funnel cake merchant was let in on the secrets of Swedish funnel cakes, and so on.</p>
        <p>Mr. Biderman waxed gastronomic, recalling herrings in marinades, salmon patties, Danish cheeses, chocolate balls and an old fair standard: Norwegian krumkake, a waffle made with special irons topped with creams and berries.</p>
        <p>EACH year the Swedish pancakes concession, run by Viking Lodge No. 745 Vasa Order of America, attracts a winding line of visitors who wait for their treat, something between the thickness of an American pancake and a French crepe, topped with lingonberries. There are Swedish crackers, rye crisps called knckebrd topped with herring, meatballs and yes, lingonberries. ''Is it good?'' asked Mr. Biderman. ''You're talking to a Swede -- of course!''</p>
        <p>This year, for the first time, a Finnish-Estonian woman is setting up shop to sell porilainen, a sliced bologna-like sausage served in a bun. Alas, there will be no aquavit, no vodka, only wine and beer. But that should be enough.</p>
        <p>''It's sort of my job before things open to go around and taste everything,'' said Mr. Biderman. ''That's the good part of it. By the end of the day walking around and eating, you're pretty tired.''</p>
        <p>Hard as it is to believe, each year at the end of the day, fair organizers gather to celebrate at a local restaurant to congratulate themselves and talk over the day -- what worked, what didn't. ''You go,'' Mr. Biderman said, ''and you hope you don't fall asleep.''</p>
        <p>Bon appetit. Or, as they say in Sweden, smaklig mltid!</p>
