        <p>It still surprises Dr. Steven J. Mondre that his dental patients have started arriving for appointments half an hour early and staying half an hour late. With a gleaming grin, he welcomes them to his cozy 16th-floor office at 57th Street and Lexington Avenue, but he knows they are not eager for a $95 teeth cleaning. They want the golf.</p>
        <p>A few months ago, Dr. Mondre covered the L-shaped terrace around his office in AstroTurf. Then a few weeks ago, he added a couple of holes, set out a putter and told patients they were welcome to take a swing.</p>
        <p>The terrain is uneven (it slopes to the east) and the fairway tricky (6 feet wide and 40 feet long). The view beyond the green is breathtaking, though not for those afraid of heights. Buildings tower overhead, including the smoky-mirrored International Netherlands Group across the street and the copper-turreted Central Synagogue down the block. It is always breezy, and after lunch the terrace sits in shadow.</p>
        <p>But patients like David C. Gerli, 89, say they love the view and the happy distraction.</p>
        <p>''Not only is it amusing, but where else can you putt while you wait?'' Mr. Gerli asked. ''You can also look at the nice buildings all around and sit in the fresh air. It's great.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Mondre, 45, took up golf three years ago, but said he did not create the course to get in extra putting practice. He just wanted to make good use of the extra space and find a way to relax the 60 to 80 patients he sees each week before and after treatment.</p>
        <p>''One thing patients usually want to do is get in and get out,'' he said, lounging in one of the terrace's green plastic chairs. ''But we try to make it a pleasant experience, and this takes the pleasantness level up a few notches.''</p>
        <p>So, what's next, a clown and a windmill?</p>
        <p>''Yeah, for the less serious golfer,'' he said, laughing. ''No, I think next summer, I'll add a vegetable garden. The garden for some, the golf for others.''</p>
