        <p>TO its proponents, it is the next unsung academic frontier.</p>
        <p>''There isn't an aspect of social policy or experience that isn't deeply caught up in disability issues,'' said Susan Schweik, an associate professor of English at the University of California at Berkeley, who teaches a course on disability and literature. ''It's one of the great issues, like race, class and gender.''</p>
        <p>Disability has spread from the more familiar precincts of the law, medicine and public policy into the humanities -- from Richard III to labor history to discussions on whether the tippy-toed Barbie doll is technically disabled. In Berkeley, which is the birthplace of activism among disabled people, an oral history archive of the Independent Living Movement is scheduled to open this fall at the university. Professor Schweik is developing an undergraduate liberal arts degree in disability studies (the University of Illinois at Chicago and Syracuse University offer doctorates). At San Francisco State University, a diverse group including philosophers, literature professors, theater scholars, historians and others, fewer than half with disabilities themselves, recently completed a summer institute financed by the National Endowment for the Humanities aimed at creating disability studies in the humanities. And this fall the first international conference on disability studies will be held in Washington.</p>
        <p>''The liberal arts are supposed to pose fundamental questions like, what makes a person human, and what is justice?'' said Catherine J. Kudlick, a historian at the University of California at Davis, who studies the blind historical experience and who is legally blind. ''Disability studies provide new ways of approaching these questions.''</p>
        <p>The field is potentially vast. A literature course might, for example, examine Captain Ahab or Benjy, William Faulkner's cognitively disabled (as he would now be called) character in ''The Sound and the Fury.'' ''Disability has always been used as a literary metaphor,'' said Rosemarie Garland-Thomson, an English professor at Howard University and co-director of Berkeley's institute. ''It's a highly culturally charged situation that lends itself to deep and complicated meanings.''</p>
        <p>The blossoming culture of disability might be seen as the second wave. The academic aspect emerged in the 1980's in  political science and sociology, which focused mainly on research for reforming public policies. Its scholarly emergence paralleled the political activity that culminated in the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, which made equal access for the disabled a civil rights issue.</p>
        <p>This new culture encompasses the arts, from performance art to life writing (as expressed by insiders); sporting events; and the influence policies have had on the dominant culture, whether reflected in the Washington subway system or the extra-wide toilet stalls beloved by luggage toters and nursing mothers.</p>
        <p>''We're finally seeing a breakdown of the tragic but brave model,'' said Paul K. Longmore, the San Francisco State historian who organized the institute and who gets about in a wheelchair. Professor Longmore, co-editor of ''The New Disability History: American Perspectives,'' to be published later this year by New York University Press, says research is becoming increasingly sophisticated.</p>
        <p>History has been an especially rich vein.  ''Disability is everywhere in history, once you begin looking for it, but conspicuously absent in the histories we write,'' said Douglas Baynton, a University of Iowa historian.</p>
        <p>New scholarship is rapidly changing that, unearthing attitudes behind laws like 19th-century Chicago's ''unsightly beggar ordinances,'' which barred from public view any person ''who is diseased, maimed, mutilated or in any way deformed so as to be an unsightly or disgusting object.''</p>
        <p>The historians in this field are using these newly uncovered primary sources, studying 19th-century periodicals like the Locomotive Engineers Monthly Journal, which ran passionate philosophical debates on how to deal with frequent accidents among railroad engineers, including how disability might affect their manhood and whether they should be given alternative jobs in railway stations.</p>
        <p>Critics of the trend see it as yet another example of the political correctness and identity politics ravaging academia. ''The past 20 years has seen the humanities getting narrower and narrower,'' said John M. Ellis, a retired professor of German literature at the University of California Santa Cruz and author of ''Literature Lost: Social Agendas and the Corruption of the Humanities'' (Yale University Press, 1999). ''Like the focus on race, class and gender, this sounds to be like the usual victimology of the humanities spinning out of control.''</p>
        <p>But Professor Longmore and his colleagues argue that disability studies enrich many disciplines. ''We're doing critical analysis, not political advocacy,'' Professor Longmore said.</p>
        <p>HE does acknowledge, however, that there is an unavoidable aspect of heritage hunting from past to the present. It has caused some to reexamine figures like Milton, Beethoven and Franklin D. Roosevelt.</p>
        <p>''It's understandable that any previously marginalized group would want to find models in history,'' Professor Longmore said. ''But we need to dig deeper to analyze group experiences, public policies and cultural values. Heroes are not enough.''</p>
        <p>Though it seems specialized, disability studies -- the corporal dimension of the human experience and its consequences -- could wind up being one of the most inclusive academic fields of all. As Professor Longmore points out, ''It's a social group that all people will join if they live long enough.''</p>
