      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Called a ''gentle manifesto'' by its authors, ARCHITECTURE INSIDE OUT (Wiley, paper, $49.95), seeks for architecture to appeal to all the senses, not just the visual. Karen A. Franck, who teaches subjects like ''the erotics of architecture'' at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, and</p>
        <p>R. Bianca Lepori, an Italian architect known for designing birthing rooms, write, ''The visual presentation of architecture in magazines, monographs and books depicts few people and few, if any, indications of real, ongoing life.'' Their thesis that architecture needs to be grounded in the experience of the body, based on the actual use of the building and responsive to the site, is well illustrated; the book's photographs show the best contemporary design, from Itsuko Hasegawa's soothingly minimalist psychiatric hospital with a harbor view in Omuta, Japan, to Steven Holl's sensuously curved Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Art in Helsinki. Some points, for example the tactile significance of materials, seem to be a gloss on the classic ''Experiencing Architecture,'' by Steen Eiler Rasmussen, who does not even get a footnote. Internationalist-style architects are rightly criticized for disdaining a building's use (the firm of Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo omitted a ticket booth for its Museum of Jewish Heritage in lower Manhattan), but the role of Internationalism in liberating architecture from the weight of the past is too patly dismissed. However, the central theme -- that buildings must accommodate the human body and not vice versa -- is vital and is not heard often enough.</p>
