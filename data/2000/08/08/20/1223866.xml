        <p>LOOKING more like a prehistoric reptile than machinery, an excavator is hard at work on the arid slopes of a former sand mine here on the northern service road of the Long Island Expressway, gouging out the sand and loading it into dump trucks.</p>
        <p>It will take about three more months of earth moving to complete preparations for a 370-home project called the Hamlet on Olde Oyster Bay, which the Holiday Organization is building in a joint venture with the Roslyn Savings Bank. The 55-acre site is just west of Round Swamp Road.</p>
        <p>The sand-mining operation left behind a crater 60 feet deep spreading over 24 acres. About 1.8 million cubic yards of sand on the site will be redistributed to provide a compact and level surface for new construction, said Elliot Monter, Holiday's president.</p>
        <p>The Hamlet is one of three developments  under way that are taking barren wastelands left behind by sand-mining operations and reclaiming them for housing, among other uses. The two others are in Smithtown and in Port Washington.</p>
        <p>Lush grass, flowering plants and young trees surrounding a sales office at the entrance of the Hamlet property hint at what could be accomplished once $5 million worth of earth moving and landscaping is completed. The housing -- clusters of attached town-house-style buildings as well as detached single-family houses on their own lots -- sold out within three weeks of the opening of sales late in June, with buyers making their decisions based only on renderings and a scale model of a heavily treed site with a lake at its center.</p>
        <p>The Plainview property was formerly owned by the Town of Oyster Bay, which had intended to use it for a municipal landfill, meanwhile leasing it out for sand mining. In 1997, after New York State outlawed any additional landfills on Long Island, the town decided to sell the property and to use the money to make up for a two-year budget shortfall.</p>
        <p>In Smithtown, 88 acres of land that formerly contained a sand mine and a cement plant are being redeveloped for housing and commercial space. The parcel, on Terry Road, was assembled in 1983 by the DiCanio Organization of Smithtown, which received town approvals for a mix of detached and attached houses, rental apartments, stores and offices. The project, called the Galleria, is being built in five phases, two of which, including the commercial portion, have been completed.</p>
        <p>In Port Washington, lush grass and wetlands already cover most of what was once a scarred valley that had been mined for its sand for almost a hundred years. The 460-acre property, on West Shore Road, was also municipally owned. The Town of North Hempstead, which bought the tract in 1988 for $33.1 million, intended to build a solid waste incinerator.</p>
        <p>But in 1994, a new town board, headed by May W. Newburger, who is still the town supervisor, decided to eliminate both an eyesore and a mounting debt by building a recreation complex that would include two golf courses, with income from fees to be used to pay for some of the $30 million construction cost. The town also sold off a 42-acre portion of the property for housing, receiving $28.3 million for the parcel.</p>
        <p>The golf courses covering 230 acres are completed, and home construction is expected to start in the fall.</p>
        <p>Aside from the extra earth moving that is involved, building on former sand mines poses no particular construction problems, said Larry Gargano, whose Greenview Properties development company in Bay Shore is building 187 town houses on the Smithtown site in a joint venture with DiCanio. ''You have three possible scenarios on Long Island,'' he said. ''You have sand, which is good because it has good drainage; clay, which is bad; and bog, which is even worse. So sand is what you hope to build on.''</p>
        <p>Good drainage is also critical to bringing these barren wastelands back to life, said Richard B. Ignatow of Huntington, the landscape architect for the Galleria project.</p>
        <p>Slopes left behind by sand mining can be stabilized by the planting of seedlings or by spraying with a mixture of grass seed, water and fertilizer. Flat areas are also sprayed with the mixture, which is applied over topsoil. ''It takes money and a lot of topsoil, but these properties can be restored,'' Mr. Ignatow said.</p>
        <p>AT the Hamlet at Olde Oyster Bay, Holiday is using the deepest point of the  crater left behind by the sand-mining operation to create a 4.5-acre lake. ''Rather than look at the hole as a negative, our approach was, it exists, so how do we use it in a positive manner and to our advantage,'' Mr. Monter, the president of Holiday, said.</p>
        <p>The lake will be the focal point of the development, not only providing a visual amenity but also collecting rainwater runoff so that it can filter back into the ground.</p>
        <p>Wayne Villavaso of West Palm Beach, Fla., the landscape architect, said the theme of the Hamlet development was to recreate the look of a typical waterfront village in Oyster Bay, so he also incorporated a series of small village greens into his design to help mitigate the density of the housing.  Several of the attached buildings will also back up to wooded areas with walking paths.</p>
        <p>The entrance to the development will  have a nautical theme, with a gatehouse designed to look like a lighthouse overlooking ponds, fountains and waterfalls.</p>
        <p>House prices at the Hamlet started at $275,000 for a two-bedroom, 1,500-square-foot first-floor condominium apartment in a two-story town house and ranged up to $600,000 for a 3,900-square-foot 5-bedroom detached house on a 50-foot-by-115-foot lot. The first residents will move in by spring.</p>
        <p>At the Galleria in Smithtown, almost half of the 88-acre site is in its original barren state because construction is still under way on 33 acres where the 187 town houses are being built. That phase of the development is called Windcrest.</p>
        <p>However, a 312-unit apartment complex, Avalon Commons, that is owned and operated by AvalonBay Communities of Alexandria, Va., was completed in 1996, and sod, shrubs and flowers flourish on what used to be bare sand covering 21 acres.</p>
        <p>The first lawns are also taking root in front of 29 detached houses that are being completed on a 11.5-acre portion of the site by the DiCanio and Greenview partnership.  That phase, called Coventry Village, is sold out. Prices of the 72 town houses still available at Windcrest range from $229,000 for a 1,500-square-foot two-bedroom dwelling to $319,000 for one with three bedrooms and 2,100 square feet. Also not yet completed is another section of detached houses. These 13 four-bedroom dwellings, six of which are sold, are being built on a high point of the former sand mine by Mountain Brook Homes of Huntington, which bought 10 acres from DiCanio in February 1999. Prices range from $380,000 to $460,000.</p>
        <p>Construction of the first houses at the Port Washington site is expected to start by  October. The site's 42 acres, occupying a high point of the former sand mine, were originally bought by Harbor Ridge Associates of Manhattan, but the company subsequently sold off 33 acres to Bernard Janowitz Construction, a Roslyn Heights developer, whose financial partner is Westbrook Partners of Manhattan.</p>
        <p>On its remaining nine acres, Harbor Ridge will be building a six-story building with 324 co-op apartments for people 62 and over who want to live independently but who also want the assurance that they can receive long-term care in the same building if needed. A wing of the apartment building containing 76 additional residences has been set aside for a section that can provide assisted living and skilled nursing care.</p>
        <p>Long-term care insurance is included in the monthly maintenance residents pay, which ranges from $2,700 on a 750-square-foot one-bedroom apartment selling for $270,000, to $5,000 monthly for 2,500-square-foot penthouse selling for $1.2 million.</p>
        <p>The life care component of the project was approved by New York State in March, said David A. Pearson, the president of Harbor Ridge. At least half of the units must be under contract before construction can start ''and we are approaching that number at a nice pace,'' he said, adding that he hoped to start building before the end of the year.</p>
        <p>The remaining 33 acres of the former sand mine will be developed as a mix of housing ranging from condominium apartments to single-family detached homes. Bernard M. Janowitz, the developer, said he could not discuss prices until an offering plan had been accepted for filing by the state attorney general other than to say it would be ''luxury housing.'' Age restrictions require one family member to be at least 55. Mr. Janowitz said. He said he hoped to start both sales and construction by October.</p>
        <p>The former sand mine is otherwise flourishing. On a recent sunny afternoon, the fairways of the two golf courses were crowded with players. Osprey, tern and blue heron have been spotted in the wetland areas, said Mrs. Newburger, the North Hempstead town supervisor.</p>
        <p>''We have done two things,'' she said. ''We have diminished a huge debt and we have transformed a desolate useless desert area into a self-sustaining wonderful garden-like environment that gives our residents a place of enjoyment.''</p>
