        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I was thrilled to read Debra Nussbaum's ''For 25 Years, a Point of Light,'' (July 30) focusing on a most unusual woman, Sister Mary Vincent. Ms. Nussbaum, however, omitted the years between Sister Mary's Fordham University assignment and her first year (1975) in Camden. Sister Mary spent several of those years as the coordinator of Casa del Carmen, a Catholic agency providing services to Philadelphia's poor Spanish-speaking families. I volunteered at Casa del Carmen for more than three years and worked with Sister Mary, who taught me the true meaning of charity.</p>

        <p>I was thrilled to read Debra Nussbaum's ''For 25 Years, a Point of Light,'' (July 30) focusing on a most unusual woman, Sister Mary Vincent. Ms. Nussbaum, however, omitted the years between Sister Mary's Fordham University assignment and her first year (1975) in Camden. Sister Mary spent several of those years as the coordinator of Casa del Carmen, a Catholic agency providing services to Philadelphia's poor Spanish-speaking families. I volunteered at Casa del Carmen for more than three years and worked with Sister Mary, who taught me the true meaning of charity.</p>
        <p>Several of my friends and I (all young professionals serving in a Philadelphia-based Army Reserve unit in the early 1970's) opted to spend our monthly military commitment assisting Sister Mary at Casa del Carmen. Among our many tasks were tutoring students in English and other school subjects, collecting and distributing food, clothing and furniture to Casa del Carmen constituents, painting and doing assorted odd jobs. What I remember most vividly and am most grateful to have experienced, is Sister Mary Vincent at work. The people and families in her community, their needs and best interests, came first. She taught us how to be charitable while being compassionate, thoughtful, considerate and most important, respectful of those brave enough to ask for help.  Sister Mary Vincent really is a pioneer, and for those of us lucky enough to have done so, volunteering to assist her was truly a blessing for us.</p>
