        <p>Following last month's fatal crash near Paris, Britain and France formally grounded the Concorde after investigators determined that a problem with its tires made the world's only commercial supersonic airliner unsafe. Investigators found that the crash, which killed 113, originated in a tire blowout that caused chunks of rubber to rupture a fuel tank. The Concorde will fly again only when its manufacturers devise safeguards against a repetition, aviation authorities said.</p>
