        <p>UNTIL I went to Rome this summer, the word pilgrim usually conjured up images of the dour early arrivals on American shores. I certainly couldn't conceive of myself as a pilgrim, the kind who makes a journey to a holy place for religious purposes. I'm a lifelong Catholic, but I don't have the kind of faith that I associate with people who go to great lengths to visit the four major basilicas of Rome for Holy Year indulgences.</p>
        <p>Yet Rome overflows with both the sacred and the profane, and there are plenty of reasons to visit the city. And so when my wife, Eileen, had an opportunity to take a graduate education course at the Jesuit Curia, the order's headquarters, a block from St. Peter's Square, we jumped at the chance to finally visit Rome. We decided to ignore the warnings about how crowded the city would be for this Roman Catholic Jubilee year.</p>

        <p>UNTIL I went to Rome this summer, the word pilgrim usually conjured up images of the dour early arrivals on American shores. I certainly couldn't conceive of myself as a pilgrim, the kind who makes a journey to a holy place for religious purposes. I'm a lifelong Catholic, but I don't have the kind of faith that I associate with people who go to great lengths to visit the four major basilicas of Rome for Holy Year indulgences.</p>
        <p>Yet Rome overflows with both the sacred and the profane, and there are plenty of reasons to visit the city. And so when my wife, Eileen, had an opportunity to take a graduate education course at the Jesuit Curia, the order's headquarters, a block from St. Peter's Square, we jumped at the chance to finally visit Rome. We decided to ignore the warnings about how crowded the city would be for this Roman Catholic Jubilee year.</p>
        <p>As it turned out, we more than mingled with those crowds of special visitors: the trip, organized by Fordham University mainly for teachers and administrators in Catholic schools, included tours to all the big basilicas and a papal Mass. Not only would I get a first-hand look at all those pilgrims but I would also become one.</p>
        <p>The experience began with our accommodations. An 18-room guest house, the Fraterna Domus, is run by sisters of the Volunteers of Christian Social Service. It was spotless, quiet and spartan. Our small,  L-shaped, marble-tiled room had three twin beds (the alcove with the third bed actually gave us more room than most of the other guests had), a desk, a small, low table and a closet. Our compact private bathroom somehow included a sink, a toilet, a bidet and a shower -- but no shower curtain.</p>
        <p>The price was right, though -- $45 apiece a night, including a minimal breakfast. Do pilgrims need television or wake-up calls?</p>
        <p>While friendly and helpful, the sisters  were serious about the 11 p.m. curfew. When they gave the key to our group's leader, Dr. Gerald Cattaro, so some of our companions could try to find some night life, two who returned separately (in fact, earlier than the others) knew they had received a scolding from the sister who let them in, even without understanding a word of Italian.</p>
        <p>The Fraterna, though, is just a five-minute walk to the spellbinding Piazza Navona (plenty of nightly entertainment, and free), and about 10 minutes to the Spanish Steps, the Piazza del Popolo, the Pantheon and Castel Sant'Angelo. So the secular tourist in me would have been satisfied even without the group bus tours to other classic sights: the Colosseum, the Forum and the Sistine Chapel.</p>
        <p>Yet as Dr. Cattaro kept saying, we were on a pilgrimage, and the program quickly made us feel it. On guided tours, we eventually passed through all four Holy Doors, at the basilicas of St. Peter's, St. Mary Major, St. John Lateran and St. Paul's Outside the Walls. Cardinal Giovanni Cheli, a friend of Dr. Cattaro's who is a former representative of the Vatican to the United Nations, said Mass for us at the Basilica of SS.  Cosmos and Damian, next to the Forum. I'd never heard of this church, but it has a colorful mosaic ceiling so brilliant that it didn't seem possible that it was almost 1,500 years old.</p>
        <p>We also attended a special, intimate Mass in the former living quarters of St. Ignatius Loyola, founder of the Jesuits. The 35 in our group sat and stood in an unadorned whitewashed room with a timbered ceiling, next to Ignatius's former bedroom, where his desk and chest of drawers are displayed. It was a casual, warm liturgy, without pomp. I imagined that it was similar to the gatherings of the early Christians in the catacombs and the area uncovered in the fascinating excavations leading to St. Peter's grave under St. Peter's Basilica (begun in 1939, secretly, out of fear the Nazis would find out), which we later visited.</p>
        <p>At just about every stop, we saw other pilgrims. In fact, a group had lunch at the Fraterna on our first day -- the sisters offer one of the best bargains in town: $10 for a home-cooked, four-course meal, as long as you make reservations before noon and don't mind a set menu (wine or soft drinks are a little extra). The diners, Italians but not Romans, wore matching, distinctive kerchiefs around their necks, like Boy Scouts, and talked and smiled and laughed nonstop.</p>
        <p>Sometimes we heard groups break into prayer or song, as a cadre of about 30 did in St. John Lateran. It served to remind me, surrounded by tourists, that we were in a church, after all, not a museum.</p>
        <p>Without a doubt, however, it was at the evening papal Mass in St. Peter's Square for the Feast of St. Peter that we were immersed in pilgrim spirit. The excitement of the crowd, which filled about three-fourths of the 35,000 seats in the vast space, was almost frightening. Some had shoved us out of their way to get through the metal detectors under Bernini's magnificent colonnade in a rush for the closest seats.</p>
        <p>We were so early that we found space in about the 10th row, and a young American couple sat down next to us. They quickly left, though, after we told them that Mass was still a couple of hours away and would probably last that long again.</p>
        <p>But their seats were quickly taken and, at one point, the 90-degree heat and crowding had me thinking that perhaps the couple had made the right decision. But since we were near the front, shadows from the facade that almost inexplicably hid Michelangelo's great dome brought us some relief from the blazing sun. That was around the time the Swiss Guards took up their positions -- they would not budge for hours -- and formally attired men ushered in families of the honored guests. These included the church's newest archbishops, among them New York's Edward M. Egan, who were to receive their palliums, stoles that signify their ecclesiastical rank.</p>
        <p>As we waited, the atmosphere was laid back, with people chattering as they cowered from the sun under umbrellas or stood in hope of a breeze. Three rows ahead, a man held a radio to his ear listening to the play by play of the European soccer championships semifinal between Italy and the Netherlands. Homage was being paid to both of Italy's national religions.</p>
        <p>At 6:29 it became clear why the crowd was there. The tiny, hunched-over, red-clad form of John Paul II appeared through the great door behind the outdoor altar. Applause began, and as the pope, looking extremely frail, slowly moved toward the altar, the clapping swept backward in waves across the square.</p>
        <p>The two dozen archbishops, also in red, huge bunches of red roses on the steps, and the red-draped altar canopy framed the pontiff. As we sat for the chanting of the Kyrie (Lord, have mercy), the people just to our right started waving tiny Polish flags and red-and-white scarves, trying to get the pope's attention. Smiling, they half rose in their chairs to see if they would elicit a glance, a wave, any kind of notice from the altar. Eileen and I looked at each other, stunned by what seemed behavior from a football game or concert.</p>
        <p>But it happened again -- just after the gospel. And again -- after the archbishops received their palliums. And again -- at the end of the Mass. The Poles were not alone: a young nun in full habit waved Peru's flag when the Peruvian archbishop was called up, and the Croatian archbishop was cheered lustily by a flag-waving group of about 50 of his compatriots.</p>
        <p>And throughout the liturgy, there were muffled sounds of the soccer match on the radio. Just as Mass ended at sunset, about 8:40, with the pope getting into a jeeplike vehicle to ride among the crowd that surged to barriers to get close to him, car horns started blaring in the distance. Italy had won!</p>
        <p>This holy, and worldly, city was ready for another celebration.</p>
