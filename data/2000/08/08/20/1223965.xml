        <p>Creed has enjoyed quite a career, especially considering its short three-year duration. The group came seemingly out of nowhere, scoring one hit after another with four No. 1 singles from its debut, ''My Own Prison.''</p>
        <p>Creed's current song ''Higher,'' from the best-selling ''Human Clay,'' recently soared into the Top 10 as well.</p>
        <p>While the band mixes the influences of the hard-driving clamorous rock of Stone Temple Pilots and Alice in Chains along with a slew of 1970's metal, there's an inherent melodiousness to what they do. Much of that has to do with the frontman Scott Stapp and his soaring baritone.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stapp, who also co-writes the band's songs, didn't listen to rock until his late teens because of his strict Pentecostal upbringing, and he still brings a spiritual foundation to the band's hard-edged, arena-ready songs.</p>
        <p>For a band that spent $6,000 on its best-selling debut album, performing two nights at the Blockbuster Sony Entertainment Center (Harbour Boulevard, Camden), isn't half bad. They will appear there Aug. 25 and 26 at 7:30 p.m.; (609) 365-1300.</p>
        <p>Brian Marshall, founding member and bassist, announced last week he will be leaving the band. His replacement is Bret Hestla.</p>
