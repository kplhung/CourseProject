        <p>Storm-tossed, soaked and seasick, Larry Ellison watched as his hired posse of professional sailors scrambled to repair yet another piece of broken equipment aboard his 80-foot maxi-yacht Sayonara. It was the final days of December 1998, and Ellison and his 22-man crew were battling fierce weather off the coast of Australia in the 54th running of the annual Sydney-Hobart Race.</p>
        <p>Ellison, the chief executive officer of Oracle Corporation, was far removed from the Silicon Valley boardrooms where he has become a multibillionaire. In the now infamous Hobart race, sailing with as good a crew as money could buy, Sayonara overcame a litany of gear failures to win line honors as the first boat to finish. Far astern, six sailors perished in the storm.</p>
        <p>After dabbling in the sport in the 70's, Ellison took a long hiatus before commissioning Sayonara in 1995. In the intervening years, he has campaigned the boat vigorously. But Ellison's commitment to yacht racing escalated to new, rarefied heights last week when he announced his challenge for the America's Cup in New Zealand in 2003, an effort that will cost $80 million or more.</p>
        <p>Traveling in Europe, Ellison was not on hand for the announcement, leaving that duty to his chief operating officer, Bill Erkelens, and his campaign manager, Paul Cayard. And Ellison also declined an interview request for this article.</p>
        <p>In the aftermath of the disastrous Hobart race, however, in early 1999 Ellison spoke about his experiences in a rare talk at San Francisco's St. Francis Yacht Club, which will most likely represent his cup challenge. During the speech, Ellison described how one crewman broke an ankle, another a thumb, and a third cracked his ribs. He strongly intimated that he was finished with offshore ocean racing.</p>
        <p>But closed-course, around-the-buoys, America's Cup-style match racing appears to be a different matter. And the next cup competition has enticed several other billionaires to enter the fray for the first time, including the Seattle businessman Craig McCaw and the Swiss pharmaceutical heir Ernesto Bertarelli.</p>
        <p>As the former captain and project manager for Sayonara, Erkelens was at Ellison's side during the Hobart race. So too was the Kiwi skipper Chris Dickson, who will reprise that role with the Oracle Racing challenge, and the former Team New Zealand America's Cup sailor Robbie Naismith, who has also joined the team. In fact, Erkelens said Ellison's interest in the cup was piqued when he learned that the New Zealand crewmen who sailed aboard Sayonara might be available for his campaign.</p>
        <p>''He likes the team aspect of Sayonara, and the people,'' Erkelens said.  ''Being able to relax with a group of people completely outside of work seems to be a major draw to him.''</p>
        <p>To bolster the core group of Sayonara sailors with other experienced cup players, Ellison hired Cayard, the skipper who headed the America One challenge in the last cup, as well as several of that program's key personnel, including the operations manager, Bob Billingham. Ellison also purchased all of America One's assets, which became available when Cayard decided that the billionaires had essentially priced him out of the competition.</p>
        <p>''The cap on our old fund-raising model for America One, which was based on corporate sponsorship and raising money from private donations, seems be around 30 or 40 million dollars,'' Cayard said. ''That's less than half of what you're going to need to be competitive now.''</p>
        <p>But money is not an issue for Ellison, who also purchased the two Aloha Racing cup boats sailed by John Kolius's Hawaii-based challenge earlier this year. Ellison also owns two mega-powerboats, the 192-foot Izanami and the 244-foot Katana.</p>
        <p>It is difficult to conjure a scenario in which Ellison will be outspent, but it is also hard to lay odds on the success of a Dickson-Cayard collaboration. Both are known for being fiercely competitive, and neither suffers from a lack of self-esteem. But Cayard is coming off a fresh, tough cup challenge, while Dickson sat out the last event.</p>
        <p>Cayard said that he planned to be aboard Ellison's cup racer, but in what position remains uncertain. ''Dickson has a long relationship with Larry as Sayonara's skipper, so he's the incumbent skipper,'' Cayard said. ''I think we just have to wait and see how things go. In two-and-a-half years, anything's possible.''</p>
        <p>Even though Cayard is known as a team player, it will be interesting to see how comfortable he will be if not unequivocally in command. And if Cayard finds himself unhappy in a limited role in a Dickson afterguard, Ellison may find himself with a quarterback controversy not seen in the Bay area since Joe Montana and Steve Young were both wearing the uniform of Cayard's beloved 49ers.</p>
        <p>How close Ellison will be to the day-to-day operation remains to be seen. In the Hobart race, between bouts of nausea, Ellison took a regular turn at the wheel, and he is said to be a good helmsman. ''Larry would like to be involved as much as his schedule allows,'' Erkelens said. ''But he doesn't want to be on board unless he has spent enough time training to participate at the level required.''</p>
        <p>A lasting image of Sayonara's Sydney-Hobart ordeal is an aerial photograph of the boat in the final miles, with Ellison slumped over the lifelines, visibly drained. Now, in a manner of speaking, he is again at sea. Only time will tell if the voyage is triumphant, or plagued by that old, queasy feeling.</p>
