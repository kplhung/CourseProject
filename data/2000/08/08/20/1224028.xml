        <p>WHEN I stayed at the St. Regis Hotel a few years ago, I opened the door to a young woman dressed in white tie and tails who identified herself as the butler. Since I had no idea what to do with her, I sent her on her way. A female butler. What a funny idea.</p>
        <p>During my fifth hour of butler training last week, I was no longer amused. Maybe it was having to wear the white tie and tails in 80-degree heat. Or maybe it was that the butlers who were training me had a quality -- a stillness, a patience, an obedience of sorts -- that I will never have in this lifetime. If I could have gotten my hands on the guest who left her underwear piled in the bathtub and her shirt draped over a bedroom lamp, she would not be alive today.</p>

        <p>WHEN I stayed at the St. Regis Hotel a few years ago, I opened the door to a young woman dressed in white tie and tails who identified herself as the butler. Since I had no idea what to do with her, I sent her on her way. A female butler. What a funny idea.</p>
        <p>During my fifth hour of butler training last week, I was no longer amused. Maybe it was having to wear the white tie and tails in 80-degree heat. Or maybe it was that the butlers who were training me had a quality -- a stillness, a patience, an obedience of sorts -- that I will never have in this lifetime. If I could have gotten my hands on the guest who left her underwear piled in the bathtub and her shirt draped over a bedroom lamp, she would not be alive today.</p>
        <p>Though I was clearly a bust at butling, St. Regis Hotels and Resorts  has had no trouble finding more appropriate candidates since it started the training program in 1991. While initially, most guests were as puzzled as I was by the notion of a butler, in the last two years the service has taken off, increasing occupancy rates and customer loyalty. Other luxury hotels have started imitating it, especially as the economy booms and people have more money than time.</p>
        <p>Richard Cotter, a vice president and managing director of St. Regis, said that before joining the hotel he worked at the Waldorf-Astoria and New York Palace, where ''we put butlers in the towers of both hotels in imitation of the St. Regis.'' Under his watch, the St. Regis has recently expanded its butler services to its hotels in Houston and Washington. This winter, ski butlers will arrive at the St. Regis in Aspen, ''which will extend our service right to the slopes, so no one has to worry about their gear,'' Mr. Cotter said.</p>
        <p>Off the slopes, the St. Regis butlers -- there is one on each floor -- are considered the primary contact for guests, who can channel all requests through them, without ever calling the concierge or housekeeping. ''We live at such a frantic pace, and having the butler, someone whom you trust, is important,'' Sharon Telesca, the director of sales and marketing for the St. Regis New York, said. ''Sixty-five percent of our business is repeat, and these people have come to consider the butler their personal assistant at the hotel.''</p>
        <p>Wendy Reisman, director of public relations for the Ritz Carlton in Philadelphia, which uses the term ''club concierge'' for many of the tasks that fall under the butler's purview at the St. Regis, said: ''The term butler, in America, anyway, gives the connotation of luxury and a higher level of service, even though that service has always been available by another name.''</p>
        <p>Yet, Ritz-Carlton has recently added a technology butler, who fixes computers, beepers and cell phones, and a bath butler, who will draw a guest's bath from a menu of options.</p>
        <p>Ms. Telesca conceded, ''People have said it's a marketing gimmick, and it is, but it is also a service people are looking for.''</p>
        <p>Some guests like the service so much, they have hired the butlers away for their very own. The St. Regis recruits graduates from butler and hotel schools, but unlike the loyal family retainer in England who will carry the tray forever, here the butler is on a management track. In addition to providing guest services, each butler manages the 20 rooms on each floor and deals with all the other departments in the hotel. One former St. Regis butler now manages the Carlyle Hotel; another manages a chain of hotels in Holland.</p>
        <p>Benjamin Lau, also a former butler, is now the training manager for the program at all St. Regis properties, including the branch that is to open in Los Angeles next month, and the St. Regis Club, 105 rooms that will be managed by St. Regis at the Essex House in New York, also opening next month.</p>
        <p>''Our first generation of butlers were trained by Ivor Spencer,'' Mr. Lau said, referring to the premier butler trainer in England. ''We took the master skills from a private house and used them in a hotel setting for our guests, who are C.E.O.'s, celebrities and royalty. The butler is the nerve center of the hotel for the guest.''</p>
        <p>The usual training period for a St. Regis butler is 30 days, during which time trainees trail a butler, learning everything from cutting a cigar to opening a bottle of Champagne. Mr. Lau said trainees also ''do a lot of role-playing, trying to anticipate the guest's needs.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lau showed me to the presidential suite, where the nightly fee is $11,500. As we settled at the dining room table, he surveyed it sideways. ''This needs polishing,'' he noted. He also had the unsettling habit of running his hands along the walls or on moldings in the hallways, checking for dust, and more than once, he bent over to remove a small speck of something from the floor or a table, tucking it into his pocket.</p>
        <p>''You're trained to pay attention to detail,'' he said, enumerating the butler's myriad duties, including my personal favorite, packing and unpacking. Do people really want a stranger going through their things?</p>
        <p>Mr. Lau nodded. ''We never unpack toiletries unless requested,'' he said, ''but guests often send their luggage ahead and have the butler unpack, using his or her judgment about what needs to be pressed.</p>
        <p>''We are often asked to hang the clothes by color, which is how some people organize their closets,'' he continued. ''But if you don't like us to unpack, we will include it in your guest history and won't offer the service again. A lot of people love it.''</p>
        <p>He told of one guest who travels with an enormous assortment of vitamins; the butler must arrange them from Vitamin A onward, but never on a surface where the guest has to bend down.</p>
        <p>He's kidding, right? Mr. Lau shook his head seriously. ''When I was a butler, I found this to be very interesting about other people's lifestyles,'' he said. ''It's something for your life library.''</p>
        <p>Other selections might include the night that the guest in the presidential suite requested Mr. Lau and two other butlers to stand along the wall like movie extras, while a party of 10 was served dinner. Then, there was the morning a C.E.O.'s shined shoes  disappeared; it seemed another guest found the sight of them in the hallway aesthetically unpleasing and threw them away. The hotel, needless to say, replaced them. Did they kick out that guest?</p>
        <p>Mr. Lau looked surprised. ''No,'' he said. ''He comes back often, and when he does, we are very careful to keep all the shined shoes in the pantry until the wake-up calls.''</p>
        <p>With these kinds of considerations, don't the butlers ever feel like slaves? ''No,'' Mr. Lau said firmly. ''They are managing the lifestyle of the guest. And it is a stepping stone for their careers.''</p>
        <p>It certainly is for Keiley Rea, the 16th-floor butler to whom I was assigned. A 24-year-old native of Northampton, England, she has been at the St. Regis for five months and is already, Mr. Lau said, quite promising.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rea familiarized me with the large board in the butler's pantry, where the status of every room and its guests is updated hourly -- vacant or occupied, clean or dirty, inspected or not. When she brings anything to a room, she does not use a cart, since the hotel's idea of the butler is to remind a guest of home. Or the home  they wished they lived in.</p>
        <p>I looked through some guest histories. One ''loves Grgich Hills white wine as amenity upon arrival,'' and another ''waited too long for breakfast'' in March of 1998. That incident remains listed as a reminder not to do it again.</p>
        <p>I accompanied Ms. Rea on inspections of cleaned rooms, and Mr. Lau came along, to check on his charge. She put on one white glove to check dust on the moldings and the headboard, then got down on her hands and knees behind the desk. She opened each drawer and swept her hand underneath the paper liners. She looked beneath the sofa cushions for crumbs and arranged the chocolates, so that all the St. Regis logos faced up. She held the bar glasses up to the light to see if they were clean and double-checked the expiration dates on items in the mini bar.</p>
        <p>In the bathroom, she ran her gloveless hand over the insides of the bathtub, checking for stray hairs (yuck!), and when she checked the bathrobes, she rearranged a satin hanger, so its bow faced forward.</p>
        <p>The entire process took 15 minutes. Mr. Lau then pointed out that one bathroom sconce had a light bulb with the wrong wattage. Except for the tips of her ears turning red, she remained composed. ''Yes, thank you,'' she said evenly. I would have smacked him.</p>
        <p>As we moved on to the occupied rooms, she was distressed to find an ash in an ashtray, but went into the bathroom and emerged, relieved. ''The guest has been back,'' she said. ''There is a used washcloth as well.'' She put it on her silver tray and made a note to have it replaced. She also refolded the toilet paper.</p>
        <p>''It's nice for the guest to see that the butler's been in,'' she said comfortably, heading back to the pantry for the umpteenth time. I nodded. And I couldn't help but think that it was ever so much nicer to have a butler, than to be one.</p>
