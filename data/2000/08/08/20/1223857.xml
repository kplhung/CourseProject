        <p>When Edward Beltrami and Philip E. Palmedo brought out the first edition of ''The Wines of Long Island'' in 1993, their book signaled its principal theme with the subtitle ''Birth of a Region.''</p>
        <p>In the second edition, just published, the authors drop the subtitle, evidently implying that the region has matured; they shift their central focus to an overview of its current scene.</p>
        <p>The emphasis reflects seven years' accelerating growth during which the North and South Forks have emerged as the East's most exciting wine region.</p>
        <p>Written in a homey style, the book, nearly a coffee-table-size edition, contains sensitive photos by Sara Matthews, whose artistic eye seems to be in demand everywhere in winedom.</p>
        <p>Mr. Beltrami, a specialist in Italian wines who writes for wine magazines, is a Setauket resident and a mathematician on the faculty of the State University of New York at Stony Brook. Mr. Palmedo, of St. James, heads Palmedo Associates in East Setauket, consultants specializing in high-tech start-ups.</p>
        <p>Some weeks, even daily journalism has to gallop to keep up with fast-paced major and minor wine developments on the East End. A book that aspires to timeliness invites risk, of course; indeed, the chapter on Gristina Vineyards, which was recently purchased for a record $5.2 million by Vincent Galluccio and is becoming Galluccio Estate Vineyards, is already outdated.</p>
        <p>Still, after examining the climate, soil, grapes and wine of Long Island, and recounting the history of its grape growing and winemaking, ''Wines of Long Island'' is a helpful guidebook for weekenders and other consumers who want to visit the wineries and buy their wines.</p>
        <p>Its short profiles of estates include newcomers, of which there have been more than a few since 1993: Channing Daughters, Corey Creek, Duck Walk (formerly Le Reve), Dzugas, Lieb, Macari, Osprey's Dominion, Raphael, Schneider, Ternhaven, Wolffer/Sagpond. Oddly, the authors have shortchanged the promising Martha Clara and well-bankrolled Laurel Lake by relegating them to a mention of a paragraph apiece.</p>
        <p>Although bottles of older vintages (especially the outstanding 1988's) are hard to come by, consumers will appreciate a summary of vintages from 1993 through 1999, which is otherwise difficult, if not impossible, to find elsewhere.</p>
        <p>''The Wines of Long Island'' (134 pages, $24.95) is available from Amereon House, Post Office Box 1200, Mattituck, N.Y., 11952, and at local wineries.</p>
