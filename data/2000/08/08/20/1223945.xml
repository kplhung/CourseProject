        <p>A bulletin issued Aug. 9 said Mayor John D. Spencer was set to announce ''the biggest investment in Yonkers since the turn of the century.'' This week, the news emerged that Qwest Communications International has leased the old Saks Fifth Avenue distribution center, at 555 Tuckahoe Road, and will spend $100 million to set up the center.</p>
        <p>Jane Morrissey, a Qwest spokeswoman, said the Denver-based broad band Internet communications company would convert the 500,000 square foot facility into one of 42 so-called cybercenters it plans to build around the nation. For reasons of security and competition she would not comment on why Yonkers was chosen or when the firm would move in.</p>

        <p>'''It is great news for us,' said Phil Amicone, Yonkers deputy mayor. ''It is a quality company that will be a magnet for other quality companies in a city that is ready and waiting and open to brining in good business.''</p>
