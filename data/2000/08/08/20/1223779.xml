      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Rick Lazio is a candidate who's a nice guy. He votes his conscience, takes his time doing it and doesn't strictly follow any party line (James Traub, July 30). As a registered Democrat living on Long Island, I voted for Lazio every time. Even if I disagreed with some of his positions, at least I was voting for someone who did his best to represent and live his values.</p>
        <p>Let's lose the cynicism and accept Lazio at face value. Some people actually are in it for the public service.</p>
