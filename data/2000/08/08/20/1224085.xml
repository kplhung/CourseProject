        <p>When Jodi Richard, the wife of Dwight Merriman, chief technology officer and co-founder of DoubleClick, was providing swim therapy for Sara Muirhead's arthritic Rottweiler, Berin,  last fall, Ms. Richard's vision of building a holistic health center for animals took on a new twist. Ms. Muirhead owns Naturally Raw, a New York producer of animal food that is billed as natural and especially nutritious.</p>
        <p>Why not offer animal medicine, rehabilitation and natural food at one location, Ms. Richard asked herself. ''As I was treating Sara's dog and buying her dog food, I began to think that I would need someone like Sara,'' Ms. Richard said. She would also need a holistic veterinarian, whom she found in Marcie Fallek, who  treated Ms. Muirhead's Rottweiler for lupus and is an animal acupuncturist.</p>

        <p>Early next month, the three will open Bonnie's K9 Corporation, named after one of Ms. Richard's dogs, in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. The center, financed by Mr. Merriman, will feature natural foods prepared in-house and a 10-by-15-foot tiled swimming pool for rehabilitation.</p>
