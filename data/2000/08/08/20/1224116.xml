        <p>After nine months of blistering criticism from doctors, patients and consumer groups, the Clinton administration says it has decided to beef up protections for the privacy of medical records, beyond what it proposed last year.</p>
        <p>But administration officials said the new rules, to be issued before the Nov. 7 election, would not give patients full control of their medical records, as many advocates of privacy rights had recommended.</p>
        <p>The rules would, for the first time, set comprehensive federal standards requiring doctors, hospitals, pharmacists and insurance companies to limit the disclosure of medical information about individual patients.</p>
        <p>The health care industry and insurance companies must comply with the new rules within two years. The rules, issued under a 1996 statute, would have the force of law; no further action by Congress is required.</p>
        <p>The far-reaching, complex rules will touch almost every aspect of the health care system. They will come at a time when large amounts of medical data, including genetic information about a patient's risk of developing specific diseases, can be stored electronically and sent across the country or around the world with the click of a computer mouse.</p>
        <p>Administration officials said they saw publication of the rules as a significant achievement that could help Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic candidate for president. Mr. Gore has called for an ''electronic bill of rights'' to protect people against the misuse of computerized personal information of all types.</p>
        <p>Chris Jennings, the health policy coordinator at the White House, said President Clinton was committed to issuing the rules on medical privacy by late summer or early fall. ''That's a very high priority,'' Mr. Jennings said.</p>
        <p>Public opinion polls show that Americans are increasingly concerned about privacy in general and want greater protection for medical records, in particular. Some people say they shun testing for cancer, H.I.V. infection and other conditions because they fear discrimination in insurance or employment.</p>
        <p>The Republican Party platform promises new rules to protect the privacy of medical information, but gives no details. If Gov. George W. Bush of Texas wins the presidential election, his advisers said, he would probably want to re-examine the rules, rather than rely on the policy judgments of the Clinton administration.</p>
        <p>The White House published the proposed rules in the Federal Register on Nov. 3, 1999. After reviewing thousands of public comments, federal officials said, they expect to make these changes:</p>
        <p>*The rules, as originally proposed, would have applied mainly to information transmitted electronically or stored in computers. The final rules will also apply to many paper records. This is an important change because most medical records are still kept on paper.</p>
        <p>*Under the proposed rules, health care providers and insurance companies were supposed to advise patients of their rights and tell them how personal medical information might be used or disclosed. The new rules are likely to go further, stipulating that doctors should get patients to sign forms acknowledging that they have actually received such notices.</p>
        <p>*The proposed rules would have permitted the use and disclosure of medical information without a patient's consent for treatment, payment and a wide range of loosely defined ''health care operations.''  They would also have prohibited doctors from asking patients to sign a consent form unless it was required by state law. The new standards will allow doctors to seek the patient's consent, and many doctors said they had an ethical obligation to do so.</p>
        <p>Under current practice, doctors often ask patients to sign forms authorizing the use and disclosure of medical information for various purposes.</p>
        <p>The American Civil Liberties Union said, ''The proposed regulations are a step backward from current practice because they require only notice and not consent.''</p>
        <p>Administration officials said the new rules would limit disclosure of medical information to the ''minimum necessary'' and give patients a right to see their medical records. In addition, the rules would pre-empt weaker state laws.</p>
        <p>A person who discloses health information in violation of the rules could be fined $50,000 and imprisoned for one year. If the offense is committed for commercial advantage or personal gain, the rules allow tougher penalties: a $250,000 fine and 10 years in prison.</p>
        <p>The 1996 law directed the administration to issue rules on medical privacy if Congress failed to pass legislation by Aug. 21, 1999. Lawmakers  missed that self-imposed deadline. Congress could alter any of the new standards, but has been at an impasse, under pressure from scores of lobbyists with conflicting interests on the issue of medical privacy.</p>
        <p>Robert M. Gellman, an expert on privacy and information policy, said the administration was ''taking a real gamble'' in issuing the rules before the election because they might be criticized as not going far enough to protect privacy.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, the Health Insurance Association of America and the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association said the proposed rules went too far, exceeded the government's legal authority, were unworkable and would impose new costs on patients and employers, who pay for much of the nation's health care.</p>
        <p>When the rules were proposed last year, they were praised at first, but then criticized by the American Medical Association, the American Civil Liberties Union and experts like Janlori Goldman, director of the Health Privacy Project at Georgetown University.</p>
        <p>After reading the fine print, critics said the proposals were a license to disclose sensitive medical information, rather than a fence restricting access.</p>
        <p>In a typical comment, the American Cancer Society said it was concerned that the proposed rules would allow ''the total free-flow of information'' without input from patients.</p>
        <p>''We believe that the individual should retain the ultimate right to decide to whom, and under what circumstances, individually identifiable health information will be disclosed, even in cases of treatment, payment or health care operations,'' the cancer society said.</p>
        <p>Likewise, the American Medical Association said, ''Valid consent should be obtained before personally identifiable health information is used for any purpose.''</p>
