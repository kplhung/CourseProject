        <p>The idea, honestly, was modest. That the modest idea became a genuine odyssey -- a trip that changed everyone's idea of scale (as Julian Schnabel predicted it would), altered their aesthetics (as Miuccia Prada said it did hers) and boggled their concept of Egyptian grandeur itself (as Sandy Pittman went on and on about in an e-mail) -- was a fortunate accident. But all anyone wanted, at the outset, was one glamorous photo in front of the Pyramids, the kind you associate with another era of fashion.

        <p>Certainly, ancient Egypt was the first place to take fashion edicts from the 5,000-year-old equivalent of Nicole Kidman: copies of the royals' makeup holders and hand mirrors were found in the laborers' quarters, and the ancient knock-off version of her Academy Awards dress.

Just a model, a dress and a monument made five millennia ago. Why, we wondered, don't we see more of that in fashion?</p>
        <p>Certainly, ancient Egypt was the first place to take fashion edicts from the 5,000-year-old equivalent of Nicole Kidman: copies of the royals' makeup holders and hand mirrors were found in the laborers' quarters, and the ancient knock-off version of her Academy Awards dress. The ancients routinely wore sheer, see-through linens -- proof of the wearers' wealth -- racier than anything worn today. Isis is depicted in Nefertari's tomb in the original Rudi Gernreich. And the first known eye makeup was used there: Kohl ground with malachite for green eye shadow, and galena for gray. There's a reason why Las Vegas, land of ersatz glamour, named its hotels the Sahara, the Sands, the Luxor. A trip down the Nile is the definition of an odyssey. Odysseus himself ventured to the Nile in the voyage that gave such voyages their name. It's a trip that imprints itself for life on every person who takes it. The Nile, and its source, has been an obsession of pharaohs, Phoenicians, Greeks, Romans, Muhammad Ali, Ibrahim Pasha and -- until the 1960's, when it seems to have disappeared from their photos -- fashion editors.</p>
        <p>So the inspiration for the trip was, in part, the cargo-laden missions for Vogue that Anne Christensen, The New York Times Magazine's fashion director, used to take when she worked with the legendary Grace Coddington. The photographer, Dana Menussi, was chosen for her style -- she's part of a school that makes location photos mannered and surreally lit, like Hollywood movie stills pretending to be real. But Menussi, who grew up in Israel, had another film vocabulary in mind.</p>
        <p>''When I was a kid, I was addicted to those kitschy Egyptian movies they played every Friday: melodrama, with lots of tears and belly-dancing -- if there was a wedding, there was belly-dancing,'' she says. ''The feel of it was very exaggerated, the colors were intense. I didn't want to photograph some Western model in front of the Pyramids. I thought we should get an Egyptian model and do something like those movies.'' So the photos would capture Egyptian beauty: the beauty of the ancient artifacts, and the beauty of the people who live among them today. Our itinerary: two days in Cairo, one day in Aswan and one day in Luxor, which could net us not only the Sahara and the Pyramids, but also Ramses II or III, an obelisk, several temples and a colossus or two.</p>
        <p>The Part of the Odyssey When We Seek Out a Model</p>
        <p>In New York, casting for a major fashion shoot can bring out hundreds of girls, all of whom bring a card to leave behind and a book of their published photos with samples of how they look in different model moods: pouty, stern, manic. There isn't a market for overpriced imported designer clothes in Egypt, so it follows that there isn't really an industry to support nubile young models posing in them. In Cairo, there were no cards. There were videotapes.</p>
        <p>''Modeling isn't a respected profession here,'' Menussi explained. Ghada Shafik, who was one of four girls sent tor a casting session, said that her regular job, as a secretary, is much more important. It was difficult to explain to Shafik that after 9 p.m. in New York, models are so revered they can chop off a man's finger with a cigar trimmer and get away with it. It all sounded very uncivilized once articulated.</p>
        <p>For a still larger casting, Menussi and Dan Sharp, the hairstylist, went to one of Cairo's biggest modeling agencies, on the seventh floor of a walk-up in a shady part of town. Models' tapes were kept in a file cabinet marked ''72-74 female'' or ''63 to 65 males.'' It wasn't clear whether those were the years the people had modeled, or the age of the models in the file. ''The VCR kept screwing up,'' recalls Sharp, ''and the young lady who was the head of the modeling agency was a model herself. So every time we waited for the VCR to be fixed, she'd bring out snapshots of herself.''</p>
        <p>They hired Shafik.</p>
        <p>The Part of the Odyssey When the Gold Clothes Fail to Impress the Authorities</p>
        <p>It is the nature of fashion photography to show the clothes of the season, usually around a certain theme. ''Gold,'' a big trend for fall, seemed to have the kind of Egyptian flair that transcends cultural differences. We were given instructions on blending in. Blending in is not something people on fashion shoots do well, even in the most familiar of surroundings. So when the Egyptian producer of the shoot suggested we just bring the clothes in as if they were our own, Christensen and her assistant, Johnna Davis, felt that unless they were wearing a substantial bit of gold on the 12-hour flight, customs officials would never believe that 30 gilded outfits were just for their holiday. Not to mention the fact that it was 80 degrees in Egypt and the clothes were all for winter.</p>
        <p>Needless to say, the gold chain around their flashy felt fedoras, the gold scarves and the gold lame jeans did not permit blending in (1). Customs officials, not being fashion victims, didn't much care that the clothing the fashion editrixes were wearing was color-coordinated with what was in their bags. They were detained for many hours, looking very, very chic. Much baksheesh, the local word for ''gratuities,'' changed hands.</p>
        <p>The Part of the Odyssey When We Get the First Shot</p>
        <p>What we came to think of as the Egyptian head shake informed us that we couldn't shoot anywhere in Egypt until all the necessary ''permissions'' had been granted. The novel ''Death on the Nile'' may have been devoted to the glamour of Egypt, but the country today is far more Graham Greene than Agatha Christie. Which left us in the El Gezirah Sheraton Hotel basement disco for the first photo. No Pyramids for us!</p>
        <p>The time warp at the Pyramids has nothing on the time warp at an Egyptian disco. When the crew couldn't get into their rooms at the Nile Hilton until 4 in the morning, they passed the hours dancing at the in-house disco, Jackie's (which requires fancy dress), in borrowed gold heels -- including one of the guys, who had only packed Birkenstocks (2).</p>
        <p>Mahamed Magdy Deif, the resident foreign press manager, kindly agreed to let us shoot the Pyramids, but only with a ''minder,'' Adel Mohamed Ahmed, present at all times.</p>
        <p>Ahmed was quiet and serious, despite a pink shirt that said otherwise, and he had strict orders: only the Pyramids. We were also given a stamped letter in Arabic from the office explaining our mission, which didn't seem to impress anyone anywhere we showed it. Baksheesh impressed people more.</p>
        <p>Our crew piled into three Jeep Cherokees, which we'd been told were the only way to get the crew and equipment across the hilly desert. Menussi had chosen a location at the back of the Pyramids at sunset for her shot. She wanted to see all nine pyramids at Giza, and the best perspective isn't from where the tourists go, but from where the men who supply horses and camels to tourists keep their animals.</p>
        <p>Cairo itself is like extreme New York. Stoplights, optimistically installed in the 1980's, seem to only goad drivers on, so much so that signs have been added, cheerfully prodding ''Respecting the Traffic Light ... Is a Progress and Civilized Aspect.'' As we veered right to go to the Pyramids, when a sign clearly indicated that they were to the left, the driver said, ''Don't believe every sign you see in Cairo.''</p>
        <p>The Jeeps were supposed to be better than camels to go the two miles into the sands. That was the first time we made the camels laugh.</p>
        <p>After the Jeeps got stuck (3), the crew climbed out. Too much weight. In smaller groups, the drivers began ferrying crew and equipment up the hill, depositing them as the sun declined behind the breathtaking pyramids.</p>
        <p>In Gamal Abdel Nasser Street, you can come up behind them and take them by surprise. You can almost convince yourself that you've stumbled upon them, or that it's 2600 B.C. and you've come to your pharaoh's tomb to pray. If you turn full circle, and the air is clear, there are 12 pyramids visible from where these photos were taken.</p>
        <p>We'd been told that having an Israeli photographer might raise some eyebrows. So when our minder, Ahmed, asked for the second time to meet the photographer, there was some concern about how high eyebrows might go. But by the time the crew in their Jeep Cherokees had shown up, Ahmed had found Menussi and they were making animated conversation. ''I'm a big fan of her father's,'' Ahmed explained. Menussi's father is a pro-Palestinian Israeli journalist, Didi Menussi, who writes commentary, satirical poems about politics and humor and travel books, some of which her mother, Cyla, illustrates. ''He came once to Cairo to give a lecture to Cairo University, and Adel was there,'' Menussi said. ''He owned one of my father's books. When I told my father he has a friend in Egypt, he was so happy. It's never enough friends for him.''</p>
        <p>Shafik emerged in the heat, a heavily made-up heroine, her sleek coiffured hair part Maria Callas, part Jackie O. Erez Laor, the makeup artist, dubbed it ''pharaoh glam.'' For Menussi, who left Israel at 22, this was the peak of her odyssey. ''After all the stress,'' she says, ''the first Polaroid I took of Shafik in front of the Pyramids meant so much to me. Because of the problems and the peace process, I never imagined myself being there and shooting in front of the Pyramids for an American publication. It was a weird circle. As an Israeli I was close to Egypt for many years, but I had to go through the United States to get there.''</p>
        <p>The Part of the Odyssey When We Get Off the Desert</p>
        <p>The necessary permissions to shoot on the Nile still hadn't arrived. Press passes and our trusty fax were continually failing to make an impact. Meanwhile, out in the desert, a sandstorm was rising. Everyone couldn't fit into the Jeeps and make it down the mountain before it started in full force. Our camel master, Mahmaud Fouad, gave Sharp the black horse used in the shoot (4) to ride down, and the rest of us each got a camel. The nightly sound and light show, starring a booming cornball narrator channeling the Sphinx, had begun on the other side of the Pyramids, and the Sphinx glowed purple from over the hills in front of us: ''I am the Sphinx!'' sounded across the desert. It was a long trek back, and Fouad was amused, both by Sharp's great riding and our rhythmic lurching, one camel tethered with ropes tied with pom-poms behind the next.</p>
        <p>It's a joke in Egypt that riding a camel teaches you to belly-dance. Suzanne Somers would go hungry trying to sell belly busters and thigh masters to camel owners. ''Lean back on your camel when you go downhill,'' Fouad said. ''Unless you want to ride on the camel's neck -- leaning forward is the best way to get there.'' Fouad, bored by our slow descent (while our egos were beating a hasty descent), offered us a choice: ''Do you want to cha-cha-cha or la-la-la?'' We thought both choices sounded just frivolous enough to be somehow damaging to our reproductive organs. ''Neither.'' ''If you cha-cha-cha, you'll ha-ha-ha.'' ''Pass.'' He pulled up near the camel's ear. ''Cha-cha-cha!'' he commanded. Cha-cha-cha left us certain, even if we did ha-ha-ha, that we didn't want to la-la-la. Cha-cha-cha is a gallop, hooves digging into the sand, but the back stays level, knees bobbing below. Fouad wanted to race Sharp down the hill. There was some discussion of a bet. But when Sharp started down, it quickly became clear that the horse only listened to one person. And that person wasn't Sharp. Since it was Sharp's birthday, Fouad was happy to let him win. But the horse, it turns out, was not.</p>
        <p>The Part of the Odyssey When We Can't Float Down the Nile</p>
        <p>For security reasons, small boats like the picturesque feluccas are not allowed to make the trip between Aswan and Luxor with tourists on board. Only large boats sleeping at least 40, like the Triton, which Sandy Pittman recently took, are permitted. Thanks to the flashy gold clothes we were photographing, we were definitely in the tourist class, not the journalistic one.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, we were also in the fantasy class, so we were allowed a little poetic license. To evoke an intimate Nile trip, we flew to Aswan, which is farthest south, then to Luxor, and hired a boat in each place.</p>
        <p>There can't be more glamorous commercial-plane interiors than those on EgyptAir: the wallpaper has scarabs and ankhs printed on it. To pass the time on flights, Sharp was trying to remember the words to Steve Martin's ''King Tut,'' convinced that all the lyrics were in the tomb of his brains: ''Now if I'd known/They'd line up just to see him/ I'd've taken all my money/And bought me a museum.''</p>
        <p>But strains of the whole history of Egypt seem hidden away in there, too. Between Hollywood and the Bible and rudimentary history, the pharaohs who built here 46 centuries ago are perhaps the world's first celebrities. All the lessons of Percy Bysshe Shelley's ''Ozymandias'' still apply, but less so than he might have hoped. When we arrived in Aswan, two Jeeps of armed guards were awaiting some dignitaries or renegades. They followed our bus as it left the airport. The dignitaries or renegades turned out to be us.</p>
        <p>For centuries, voyagers have started their trip up the river (the Nile flows north) at the Sofitel Old Cataract Hotel. Agatha Christie's passenger cruise in ''Death on the Nile'' began amid the Moorish rooms and tin stars that glow from atop the cavernous dining room. We ran into Miuccia Prada and her husband, Patrizio Bertelli, there. They had brought their children to see Abu Simbel, an amazing temple built by Ramses II between 1290 and 1224 B.C. ''I'm a big fan of Egypt,'' Prada said over drinks on the terrace overlooking the Nile, citing its influence in her collections: ''nothing directly, but, in general, everything.'' Winston Churchill, Fran--&gt;ois Mitterand, Margaret Thatcher and Jimmy Carter are a few of the heads of state who reputedly have stayed in the room we shot from, overlooking a Nubian village, the Nile, Roman ruins, Egyptian ruins and the feluccas coasting by (5).</p>
        <p>The Part of the Odyssey When We Go to Luxor by Train</p>
        <p>We were told the train was full; that foreigners couldn't buy tickets at the window; that only second-class tickets were available; and that there was no train to Luxor, so we had to buy a ticket to Giza. None of that was true, or at least baksheesh made none of it true. There were three people in our first-class cabin. The train ambled to Luxor, rattling like poker chips, through sugar cane fields and tiny towns with students in crowds of 20 heading off to school in uniforms.</p>
        <p>We end up photographing at Luxor Temple, in front of one of the giant statues of Ramses II and one of what were once two obelisks standing guard in front. There is only one, because the other now stands in the Place de la Concorde, in Paris, leaving a gaping hole like a lost tooth in one of the most beautiful temples in Egypt. It was the heartfelt feeling of the crew that France should give the obelisk of the Luxor Temple back and put something French in its place. Like a couture designer. When the crew arrived to shoot at Luxor Temple, it was told the fee for the location would be 1,000 Egyptian pounds. Once the temple guard saw the gold Vivienne Tam coat to be photographed, he added 300 more (6).</p>
        <p>Odyssey Over: Back to Cairo</p>
        <p>The flight was hours late, so everyone played Concentration at the airport with King Tut cards (7). We decided that since we took one photograph in Luxor at King Farouk's winter palace (now a luxury hotel), it was only fitting to photograph the place where the plot to overthrow him was hatched in 1952. Cafe Riche is the Deux Magots of Cairo, a cafe that claims it was the site of the organization of two revolutions, the one in 1919 (the printing press for the anti-British leaflets is in a glass case) and the one that did in King Farouk. It's been closed for ten years for renovation, and will reopen soon, with small black and white beauty shots of 40 intellectuals, actors, artists and poets who gathered here, and a large color portrait of a Nobel Prize winner in literature, Naguib Mahfouz, who hasn't written since his right hand was paralyzed in an extremist attack in 1994. A customer, Fahmi Nashed, explained: ''This place is an inheritance and a heritage. All of those people are crowned with the nobility of the culture and the only one still living is Naguib Mahfouz.''</p>
        <p>The cafe is considered such a treasure that its restoration was said to be overseen by the same man who supervised the restoration of the Sphinx.</p>
        <p>To celebrate the end of the odyssey, everyone wore galabiyyas -- caftans Egyptian men wear -- to dinner in the chic rooftop restaurant of the Nassar-era Nile Hilton (Frank Sinatra and Jane Russell attended the hotel's opening in 1959). But it was a celebrity from another era that came to mind: Queen Hatshepsut, one of the few female pharaohs, depicted on her temple's walls dressed as a man, in a pharaoh's kilt and pointed beard, a 3,500-year-old lesson in the power of a fashion statement. On the walls of her temple in the Theban Hills, her great odyssey to Punt is rendered, in which she brought back myrrh trees for temple incense.</p>
        <p>Our loot from Egypt -- the photos -- were as ephemeral as her myrrh, even if we can't record our odyssey in stone. But like her, we were really out to bring back beauty from another place, and even from another time. And to build a bridge from one culture to another.</p>
