        <p>THE low-slung hat that hides much of Dwight Yoakam's face gives the impression he is the strong, silent type who keeps his thoughts to himself.</p>
        <p>It is true that Mr. Yoakam reveals little of himself in interviews or through his publicity people. Luckily, his singing, guitar playing, song writing and acting talents make up for his reluctance to get personal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yoakam's reticence may date back to his beginnings in country music when he found himself in hot water after criticizing his peers for  sounding too pop-oriented. His own inspirations hark back to the hardcore country talents of Buck Owens  and Merle Hagard, with a little Roy Orbison country rock thrown in.</p>
        <p>The ever-present hat has become a trademark for the 42-year-old star, who has had a total of 14 albums since breaking into the country music scene in the 1980's with ''Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc., Etc.'' He will be supporting the most recent one -- dwightyoakamacoustic.net -- with a tour that will make two stops in New Jersey next month.</p>
        <p>The album, on Reprise Records, is available on the Internet either through the address that is the album's name or through dwight yoakam.net or www.bakersfield biscuits.com, the Dwight Yoakam home pages, as well as through more traditional outlets.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yoakam is right at home on the Internet. He has been the host of Internet chats and has made clips of his latest album available on the album Internet site. He also released iSong CD-Rom last November, interactive software for guitar students.</p>
        <p>The newest release is an all-acoustic version of some of his more famous songs.</p>
        <p>''We thought it would be more of a communication between myself and my core audience, but it has had a lot of good response,'' said Mr. Yoakam, who sits alone on stage for part of each of his concerts, accompanying himself on the guitar.</p>
        <p>The current tour, which draws from the acoustic material, from  past work and from another album that will be released in October, will stop at the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City on Sept. 2 and at the Washington Township Center for the Performing Arts on Sept. 11.</p>
        <p>The Performing Arts Center is one of the few concert halls in the country, and the only one in the state, operated by a school district, according to Rebecca Keith, its manager. When the Washington Township Board of Education was building a new high school, it decided to design an auditorium suitable for professional concerts, making it a commercial venture, Ms. Keith said.</p>
        <p>The 2,500-seat auditorium, opened two years ago, is reserved for school functions 100 days a year and used for professional concerts the rest of the time. Natalie Merchant, Trisha Yearwood and Weird Al Yankovich are among the other artists who have, or are going to, appear there.</p>
        <p>The title of Mr. Yoakam's studio album that is due out in October, ''Tomorrow's Sounds Today,'' in a way sums up all his music, which is old-style country with an electrified modern twist that builds on the bluegrass, hillbilly roots that made the Grand Ole Opry famous in the 1950's. It is an updated version of the traditional country sound and won't be heard on crossover radio stations, as much of today's country is. .</p>
        <p>Born in Pikeville, Ky., and raised in Ohio, Mr. Yoakam is now based in Los Angeles, after a short and relatively unproductive stay in Nashville. According to one of the many fan Internet sites, Mr. Yoakam played guitar and appeared in school plays while growing up. He still devotes almost as much of his time to movies and videos as he does to the  music that has won him two Grammy awards and 15 nominations.</p>
        <p>In his latest movie, ''South of Heaven, West of Hell,'' Mr. Yoakam is not only the star but also the writer and director. He also directed all of his own videos.</p>
        <p>''Acting is a natural extension of music,'' Mr. Yoakam said. ''I decided to tell my stories as a film director. It is part of the expression of a performer. I don't think those two things are far removed from each other.''</p>
        <p>During his days on the video or movie set, he keeps a tape recorder handy for any musical thoughts that cross his mind. He usually comes up with the melodies first but he is always jotting down lyrical thoughts or ideas. Whether the lyrics can be considered poetry is not a judgment Mr. Yoakam is willing to make.</p>
        <p>''I'll let someone else be the judge of that,'' he said. ''I am articulating an emotion; I'll leave the interpretation to others.''</p>
        <p>DWIGHT YOAKAM  Trump Taj Mahal, 1000 Boardwalk, at Virginia Avenue  Sept. 2, 9 p.m.  (609) 449-5150.</p>
        <p>Washington Township Center for the Performing Arts  529 Hurffville-Cross Keys Road, Sewell  Sept, 11, 8 P.M.  (856) 589-8500, extension 7645</p>
