        <p>The United States Forest Service drew some derision last year when it  told the Appalachian Mountain Club to make sure a hut the group was rebuilding in New Hampshire's White Mountains was wheelchair accessible according to federal rules. The Galehead hut is perched 2,000 feet up a boulder-strewn trail, doubters pointed out; a wheelchair would never make it.</p>
        <p>Never say never.</p>
        <p>Last week, three hikers in wheelchairs engineered for rough terrain and two hikers on crutches made it up the 4.6-mile trail in about 12 hours, under their own steam but with plenty of help from friends, family members and volunteers. They conquered the mountain, they said, to show that their determination should not be underestimated -- and for a fun hike in the woods.</p>
        <p>Their Galehead trek and the hubbub over the hut highlight a tricky question: Just how accessible must the naturally not-very-accessible wilderness become?</p>
        <p>Forest Service officials say they have no plans to pave trails, but when it comes to new buildings, however remote, the answer is: very accessible.</p>
