        <p>AT the Renaissance Faire in Tuxedo, N.Y., there is the fair Maid Marian joining in a hand-to-hand brawl between the forces of Robin Hood and the Sheriff of Nottingham.</p>
        <p>A few steps farther into Sterling Forest, Queen Elizabeth I and her courtiers greet Her Majesty's 21st-century subjects. Not far off, two slightly crazed creatures, Thomas of Bedlam and the Faerie Trapper, show visitors the unpredictable nature of humors in disharmony.</p>
        <p>Who are these performers dedicated to ushering their patrons to this 16th-century hamlet of escapism? Why are they willing, for unprincely pay, to spend their summer weekends in hot and heavy period costume, improvising under the blistering sun or pouring rain, from 10:30 a.m. to 7 p.m.?</p>
        <p>''As a performer it's the greatest challenge imaginable,'' said Ann Alford of Brooklyn, who plays Queen Elizabeth. ''Being onstage with a written script is a cakewalk in comparison.''</p>
        <p>Kelly Kilcoyne of Hawthorne, N.J., who plays Maid Marian, agreed, saying that the fair, which opened Aug. 5, was an opportunity to grow as a performer. (Her husband, Don Kil coyne, is Tom of Bedlam.) ''You also learn period language, dialects, have the opportunity to learn stage combat, traditional songs, period dance,'' said Ms. Kilcoyne, who grew up in New Milford. ''Yes, the costumes are often heavy and hot, but it is the ultimate game of dress up.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Alford and the Kilcoynes are trained actors with experience ranging from community to professional theater. Ms. Alford earned a Master of Fine Arts degree from the University of Virginia and studied in London before moving to New York to pursue an acting career. For nine years the Renaissance Faire has provided Ms. Alford with steady employment without forcing her to give up her job at an investment company in Greenwich, where she is a payroll and pension supervisor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kilcoyne, a 10-year veteran at Sterling Forest and member of Actors Equity Association, works as a creative director for a Manhattan marketing company while Ms. Kil coyne, a five-year veteran, works in a Hawthorne bookstore.</p>
        <p>The Faire also offers the performers a very close-knit second family. After a long Saturday of being in character, the actors camp out in Sterling Forest, where they may pop a beer, grill a bite to eat and generally hobnob.</p>
        <p>''Ren Faire people, present and past, are definitely my closest friends,'' Ms. Alford said. ''I initially auditioned back in 1992 because the stage manager that year was the best man at my wedding.''</p>
        <p>The Kilcoynes said that in the past three years they have attended seven weddings of people they met at the Faire. The Kilcoynes themselves tied the knot at the Faire five years ago. Mr. Kilcoyne, who was playing a pirate that summer, kidnapped Ms. Kilcoyne and absconded with her to the Kissing Bridge, where he proposed to her -- in verse. Ms. Kilcoyne consented through her tears.</p>
        <p>''I didn't realize that the stage manager heard me instruct the other pirates about the plan,'' Mr. Kilcoyne said. ''So when I was proposing, she told everybody on the headset. When we returned from the Kissing Bridge, everybody was cheering us.''</p>
        <p>Christine Wells, of Danbury, first went to Sterling Forest 10 years ago with her family. She enjoyed herself so much that this year she has joined the ensemble as Heather Willow, a Cockney Faerie Trapper.</p>
        <p>''When I became an avid reader of Shakespeare, my mother suggested I try out for it,'' said Ms. Wells, who will be a senior at Danbury High School in a few weeks. ''I get to set my inner lunatic free.'' Ms. Wells, who has no previous acting experience, became versed in the craft of improvisation during the rigorous rehearsal period that starts in June in Manhattan. The actors attend workshops where they learn stage combat, improvisation and matters pertaining to the Elizabethan world.</p>
        <p>''The workshops are structured toward building a character with a history and a reason for being at this fair on this particular day,'' Ms. Al ford said. ''The language workshops, some of which I teach, aim to get people use to speaking in a 16th-century way so that it becomes second nature and doesn't get in the way of improvising.''</p>
        <p>In July, the rehearsals intensified on site, Mr. Kilcoyne said. ''Kelly, as Marian, has had a heavy fighting rehearsal schedule, including work with the joust horses, because Maid Marian will be seeing a lot of combat this year,'' he said. ''She's also got a lot of scene work, and rehearsals with the Singing Wenches.</p>
        <p>''I had a lot more improvisational work,'' he said, ''since my role will mostly entail theater sports-style improvisational comedy. I'm also rehearsing for the role of Petruchio in 'The Taming of the Shrew,' '' an hourlong production in the fair.</p>
        <p>Now that the show has opened, Ms. Wells said, her routine, at least on weekends, has not relented. ''On Saturday I'm up at 6:30 a.m., on the road by 7:30 a.m.,'' she said, adding that her father drives her in because she is just learning to drive herself. ''Then I scramble into my costume to be ready for the 9:45 company meeting, after which we all head out to assigned areas on the grounds to wait for the first patrons that pour in. I have three shows a day with Luna Bloom, the Faerie Godmother, called Faerie Lore, where we tell a fairy tale and talk about the nature of fairies. I take a half-hour break for lunch, I dance the maypole once or twice a day and cheer at the royal joust, and then try to meet as many people as I can before they leave the shire.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Alford said that, hard work notwithstanding, there was relatively little turnover in the cast. Nonetheless, she said, ''There's always attrition,'' adding, ''We lose actors for many reasons including injuries, other job offers, or sometimes, I believe, panic.''</p>
        <p>Of the four actors, Mr. Kilcoyne is the only one to miss a performance thus far. He missed one day his first year to attend his father's funeral.</p>
        <p>''Of course, it never occurred to me to go back to work the next day, until my mom woke me up early in the morning and said, 'You've got to get to the Faire,' '' he said. '' 'Mom,' I said, 'we just buried Dad yesterday'.  'Yes,' she said, 'and that's why you have to go; today's the only day he'll be able to see you perform.' ''</p>
        <p>Each of the actors plans to return next year and, perhaps, the year after. They show no signs of wearying or returning to the 21st century for any foreseeable weekends.</p>
        <p>''Every once in a while we think 'beach house,' '' Mr. Kilcoyne said. ''We could be sitting in a beach house right now. But the audience is still here, and the shore will be there for a long time. It'll wait for us.''</p>
        <p>The New York Renaissance Faire runs Saturdays and Sundays, 10:30 a.m. to 7 p.m., through Sept. 20. Sterling Forest is in Tuxedo, N.Y., Route 17A, just off Route 17 (11 miles south of Woodbury Common Factory Outlets). Admission is $15.75, $6 for children 3 to 12. Parking costs $5, and there is shuttle service to the gates. The number to call for more information is (914) 351-5174, or visit the event's Web site, www.renfair.com.</p>
