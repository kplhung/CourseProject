        <p>A special Polish court last week cleared the popular president, the former Communist Aleksander Kwasniewski, and a former president, the Solidarity hero Lech Walesa, of charges that they spied for the Communist secret police.</p>
        <p>But behind that bizarre and embarrassing drama, Poles believe, are the desperate straits of Solidarity's current leader, the ambitious Marian Krzaklewski, whose own candidacy for the presidency is floundering badly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Krzaklewski's Solidarity coalition, running Poland with a minority government, is widely unpopular and is expected to lose parliamentary elections, probably next spring, to Mr. Kwasniewski's reformed Communists.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Kwasniewski himself, now that he has been cleared, is almost guaranteed re-election as Poland's president. The only question is whether he will win an absolute majority in the Oct. 8 first round against about 18 opponents, or whether he will be forced into a runoff against the second-place finisher.</p>
        <p>There's the rub for Mr. Krzaklewski, 50, widely considered the brains and puppet master behind the government. He is acknowledged by Western diplomats in Warsaw as a shrewd politician, but they say he failed to come into the open and actually run the government, and now seems likely to pay the price.</p>
        <p>Should he fail to force Mr. Kwasniewski into a second round -- or even worse, run third and not make the cut -- his political career could be in ruins, and the party's showing in the parliamentary elections would suffer further.</p>
        <p>At the moment in the polls, Mr. Krzaklewski is running third, with only 6 percent of the vote. Mr. Kwasniewski has a whopping 62 percent, former Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski is a distant second with 10 percent, and Mr. Walesa, the Solidarity labor hero of the Communist era who persists in running against his own Solidarity inheritor, is fourth with 4 percent.</p>
        <p>So Mr. Krzaklewski needs Mr. Walesa's votes. Anything that reduced support for Mr. Kwasniewski or Mr. Walesa, or forced them to withdraw from the race, would be beneficial.</p>
        <p>Therefore, many Poles and Western diplomats believe, Mr. Krzaklewski turned to a 1997 law that requires those seeking high office to declare whether they collaborated with the universally despised Communist secret police.</p>
        <p>The idea behind the trials, this theory goes, was to embarrass Mr. Kwasniewski and force Mr. Walesa out of the running. If so, the maneuver appears to have failed, clearing the former Communist president of suspicion and generating sympathy for Mr. Walesa.</p>
        <p>Mr. Walesa originally said that the accusations against him -- that in the early 1970's, before he became a national figure, he was an agent known as ''Bolek'' and informed the secret police about his friends and colleagues -- were the result of a vendetta by former Communists.</p>
        <p>But after the closed court cleared him, Mr. Walesa suggested that former allies in Solidarity, who control the government, were to blame.</p>
        <p>''It looks like they wanted to humiliate Walesa,'' said Jacek Kucharczyk, deputy director of the Institute for Public Affairs, an independent research organization here. ''It appears that Krzaklewski's people sent papers to the court to incriminate him, and then sent papers at the last minute to get him off the hook,'' he said. ''Solidarity seems pretty desperate about its standing in the polls and they decided to play hardball.'' Now Mr. Walesa may benefit from a sympathy vote, Mr. Kucharczyk said.</p>
        <p>Spokesmen for Mr. Krzaklewski and the government denied any attempt to manipulate the legal process. But Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz, the previous prime minister and himself a reformed Communist, said he had no doubt that the accusations against Mr. Kwasniewski and Mr. Walesa -- and the timing and manner of their trials -- were part of a political game by Mr. Krzaklewski and his allies.</p>
        <p>''We thought Solidarity had strong proof against Kwasniewski, especially when Krzaklewski decided to run'' for the presidency, Mr. Cimoszewicz said. ''But it's important to kill your target, and now he's getting killed. Solidarity wanted to destroy Kwasniewski, but he's now immunized against attack.''</p>
        <p>The 1997 legislation, based on a Czech law, imposes no legal penalty for confessing to collaboration with the old secret police, so long as the person declares it -- as Mr. Olechowski did, apparently with no great harm to his popularity. But anyone found to be lying, through an investigation by the secret police and the finding of this secret screening court, is banned from politics for 10 years.</p>
        <p>So all presidential candidates were bound to be screened in any case. The evidence against Mr. Kwasniewski, a member of the Communist Party, was thin. But Mr. Walesa had a harder problem, given his own admission that he signed some awkward documents in late 1970, when he was 26, just after he participated in workers' strikes at the Gdansk shipyards. And clearly he had a big file with the secret services, which had faked some documents in the early 1980's, trying to deny him the Nobel Peace Prize he won for leading the Solidarity trade union.</p>
        <p>While Poles do not want the mercurial, unsophisticated Mr. Walesa to return as their president, they do not want him humiliated, nor to think of him as a collaborator.</p>
        <p>Part of Mr. Krzaklewski's problem was his decision in 1997 to be the back-room boss of the government, ordering around his former professor, Jerzy Buzek, whom he made prime minister. Mr. Krzaklewski managed to undermine Mr. Buzek while not avoiding blame for the government's growing unpopularity.</p>
        <p>Mr. Krzaklewski, recognizing that he must at least run second to Mr. Kwasniewski, or watch his control of a panicked party disintegrate, is sounding an increasingly populist and nationalist note on the hustings, especially about the problems presented by Poland's application to join the European Union. And Mr. Kwasniewski, 45, who has gotten plump in office, is on a weight-loss regimen to renew his magnetism for Poland's less substantive voters, trying to spare the electorate the bother of a second round.</p>
