        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>My family of four recently vacationed on Long Beach Island. On one of our first days at the beach, I found myself sitting alone at our spot near the lifeguards. I was approached by a beach badge checker. Prepared for the transaction, I promptly paid the obligatory fees. Cathy, my wife, later recounted an exchange that she had with my 9-year-old daughter, Beth, while they stood at the shoreline watching our 5-year-old son, Greg, play tag with the waves:</p>
        <p>Daughter: ''Mom, don't look now, but there is a pretty woman flirting with Daddy.''</p>
        <p>Mother: ''Don't worry, honey, Daddy isn't that lucky. It's just a beach badge checker. Look, she's giving him change.''</p>
        <p>Daughter: ''Oh, too bad for Daddy.''</p>
        <p>Gene Patten</p>
        <p>Our family was sitting on the boardwalk in Spring Lake eating our lunch when directly in front of us, a large, fully dressed woman started screaming in the face of a small man, also fully dressed. He hung his head as she raved. Apparently, he had forgotten to pack their swimsuits. She continued yelling for at least 10 minutes, then she threw everything she was carrying down on the boardwalk and stamped off. The man got down on his knees and picked up every item and repacked and went running after her. My young daughter turned to me and said, ''That was sadder than watching Old Yeller get shot.''</p>
        <p>Betsy Regan</p>
        <p>While waiting in line at J. Crew in the Garden State Plaza, I observed a young woman foraging through a mountain of sale-priced sweaters.  She finally settled on a brown wool V-neck and a beige wool blend, and reluctantly threw back a maroon crew-neck.</p>
        <p>In justifying her purchases to her speculative significant other, she noted that the sweaters were perfect for skiing. In addition, she said, they would look great over leggings, and most of all, they would keep her warm on those cold winter nights.</p>
        <p>Her partner nudged her and said, ''I thought that was my job.''</p>
        <p>''Yes,'' she replied, ''but you're not on sale.''</p>
        <p>Deidre Flanagan Ward</p>
        <p>Conversation between a pair of 20something men outside a Starbucks in Morristown:</p>
        <p>First Man: ''I ran into Jim and Lisa at a party on Saturday night. Do you think he'll every marry her?''</p>
        <p>Second Man: ''He already did, last summer.''</p>
        <p>First Man: ''No kidding. They acted too much in love to be married.''</p>
        <p>Audrey Corn</p>
        <p>NICE DAYS FINISH LAST</p>
        <p>It's far and away</p>
        <p>The dumbest cliche</p>
        <p>But what can I say --</p>
        <p>Don't have a nice day? Edmund Conti</p>
        <p>My 5-year-old Israeli granddaughter was visiting our home in Little Silver. I realized how little she knew of the local culture on a visit to the local supermarket.</p>
        <p>I had earlier asked, ''Would you like to go with me to the A&amp;P?'' Then, after we had finished shopping there, she asked ''When do we go to the P?''</p>
