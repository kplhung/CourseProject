        <p>Four men from Pennsylvania involved in a shootout with a New Jersey police officer on Friday were charged yesterday in the case, the police said. Another police officer fatally shot a fifth man.</p>
        <p>The four surviving suspects were charged with unlawful possession of a weapon, the Hunterdon County prosecutor's office said. One of the men, Andre O. Warren, 22, was also charged with attempted murder of a police officer, cocaine possession and being a fugitive from justice. All of them were from Allentown, Pa., and they were in custody last night.</p>
        <p>The police said the dead man, Oneil T. McKoy, 21, was killed during the shootout in Clinton, N.J., after he fired a handgun at Steven Sexton, an officer from the State Department of Human Services. Officer Sexton had encountered Mr. McKoy in a thicket around 6:30 a.m. Friday near the Hunterdon Developmental Center, the police said. Officer Sexton ordered Mr. McKoy to freeze, police officials said, but the man opened fire. When the officer returned fire, he struck and killed Mr. McKoy, the police said.</p>
        <p>Earlier, Officer Sexton had been part of a manhunt for the five men after they were involved in another shootout with another police officer, the police said. The incident began about 3:30 a.m. when Patrolman Cory Kubinak of the Clinton police made a routine stop of the men's car  in Union Township. Patrolman Kubinak asked the driver, Mr. Warren, to step out of the vehicle after he could not produce any identification.</p>
        <p>After several shots were fired, all the men escaped into the surrounding woods. Four were captured later during a manhunt that involved search dogs and helicopters.</p>
