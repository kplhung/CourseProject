        <p>Rudy Franchi letter on Phillip Lopate's August 13 article notes that Marshall Lewis was program director of Bleecker Street Cinema during early 1960's (S)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Phillip Lopate's article ''When Foreign Movies Mattered'' [Aug. 13] was of particular interest because I, along with Marshall Lewis, was program director of the Bleecker Street Cinema during the early 60's. The foreign film series at the Film Forum sounds like one of the world cinema surveys we annually offered.</p>
        <p>The reason for this similarity: these were the films we had available to show at the time, and thus they were the films that got written about and formed the sensibilities of a generation of film buffs. It could well have been 20 or so other titles being screened by the Film Forum.</p>
        <p>To even unearth this group of films was sometimes difficult. Ownership of the rights was a quagmire, and getting screenable prints required scouring film exchanges and closed theaters as well as holding long and garbled trans-Atlantic telephone calls with foreign producers, distributors and filmmakers. Sometimes we would discover a print but have no lead on the rights. At that point we would screen the film, subscribing to the creed: it is easier to beg forgiveness than get permission.</p>

        <p>All this might be hard to understand in an age of instant access, but the late 50's were a dark age for old movies. Many of them were disappearing because of neglect. Along with the heroic efforts of film preservationists were those of theater operators like the Lewis's at the Thalia and Dan Talbot at the New Yorker who felt strongly that seeing every kind of film was a way to save all films.</p>
