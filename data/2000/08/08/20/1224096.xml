        <p>Wall Street is expecting the gray heads at the Federal Reserve to leave interest rates alone when they meet on Tuesday - leaving analysts looking at a slow summer week.</p>
        <p>Inflation has continued to poke along, showing only glints of price pressures in the fine-print numbers. However, there were signs of an unexpected economic turnabout from a few months ago, when a bona fide slowdown seemed to be taking shape.</p>
        <p>It looks like we had a period where the economy was softening, said F. Ward McCarthy, managing director of Stone &amp; McCarthy Research Associates. Have the latest data been a statistical bounce? Or a more pronounced rebound? One month can't tell you.</p>
        <p>However, Mr. McCarthy said that the Fed would continue to filter economic data through the lens of productivity gains, as it has in the past. With advances in productivity holding, inflation will be mitigated even if growth is strong.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones industrial average ended the week up just a smidgen, 0.17 percent, to 11,046.48 points, while the Nasdaq rose 3.7 percent to 3,930.34, and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 advanced 1.35 percent to 1,491.72.</p>
