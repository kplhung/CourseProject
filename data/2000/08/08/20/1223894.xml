        <p>SO much for Dr. Marjorie Castro's summer vacation. For Dr. Castro, the Croton-on-Hudson school district superintendent, summer hasn't been a day at the beach, or at the mountains, a lake or anywhere else.</p>
        <p>Instead, like many of her counterparts, this summer has been a relentless search for teachers to staff her classrooms come Sept. 6. As of mid-August, Dr. Castro still had openings for English, math and social studies at the secondary school level.</p>

        <p>SO much for Dr. Marjorie Castro's summer vacation. For Dr. Castro, the Croton-on-Hudson school district superintendent, summer hasn't been a day at the beach, or at the mountains, a lake or anywhere else.</p>
        <p>Instead, like many of her counterparts, this summer has been a relentless search for teachers to staff her classrooms come Sept. 6. As of mid-August, Dr. Castro still had openings for English, math and social studies at the secondary school level.</p>
        <p>''For the first time in my career, I'm not going to have a vacation,'' Dr. Castro said, adding that she conducted three searches to find one fifth-grade teacher. ''I've never seen a summer like this. Usually we place one or two ads. This is the worst I've seen. We've had to place six ads.</p>
        <p>''There have always been leaves and retirements, but it's different now. Fewer people are choosing education as a career. Other districts are coming in and making contact with our teachers. It's like corporate raiding. Our teachers aren't looking, but they got calls. We're losing people to Mamaroneck, Chappaqua and Scarsdale.''</p>
        <p>Nor is Dr. Castro alone.</p>
        <p>In some districts, there is a kind of musical chairs at play: if an administrator leaves Bronxville for Chappaqua, or a science teacher hops from Ardsley-on-Hudson to Hastings-on-Hudson, vacancies come up that leave other districts scrambling.</p>
        <p>''We had planned to be finished June 15,'' said Dr. Judith Fox, Byram Hills district superintendent, who was preparing for interviews with prospective candidates in early August for positions in music, languages and physics. ''The tight market is affecting everyone. There are a great many more moves from district to district. It's so easy for good teachers to get jobs that they're not worrying about getting tenure.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Edward Shine, district superintendent for the Rye public schools, returned from his vacation to find that an art teacher had resigned. ''I'm hoping that's the end of it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>It's not supposed to be like this. For most of the county's districts, hiring for the next school year usually starts in late spring and is completed well before graduation.</p>
        <p>Instead, this year superintendents and district administrators have been recruiting well into the summer.</p>
        <p>In late July, positions were available for an advanced placement social studies teacher in Harrison, a math teacher in Dobbs Ferry and a music teacher in Peekskill. As of last Tuesday, administrators were running advertisements seeking a part-time special education teacher in Somers, a fifth-grade leave replacement in Bronxville, a math teacher in Irvington and Spanish, math, physical education and science teachers in the Lakeland Central school district.</p>
        <p>While it is not unusual for large urban districts like Yonkers or Mount Vernon to  seek staff members into August, it is surprising that this year districts like Byram Hills, Dobbs Ferry, Hastings, Harrison, Bronxville, Croton-on-Hudson, Katonah-Lewisboro and Yorktown are still looking for teachers.</p>
        <p>''It has been getting progressively worse,'' said Stacy Holmes, superintendent of the Southern Westchester Board of Cooperative Educational Services. ''This summer feels not just tougher, but as if we're lurched into a tighter place. I'm hearing people talk about long searches, difficult searches, with a shallower pool. It's been an earlier hiring season that's running longer. I'd be surprised if any superintendent is far from his or her phone.''</p>
        <p>What makes this hiring season different, many superintendents suggested, is a confluence of factors that has made recruitment and retention particularly challenging. There are fewer young teachers coming through the pipeline, especially in fields like math, science and foreign languages. Thanks in part to state incentives, more experienced teachers have chosen to take retirement packages -- which some districts encourage because they can hire less experienced teachers at lower salaries.</p>
        <p>And increasingly, teachers see themselves as free agents in sports, jumping from district to district, depending on the financial packages and benefits.</p>
        <p>''It's more like business, with people changing jobs for money, better benefits or easier commutes,'' said Dr. Karen Benedict, assistant superintendent for the Katonah-Lewisboro school district.</p>
        <p>Those were among the attractions for Ivona Veresova, who was one of 900 applicants last week interviewing for 200-plus positions in Yonkers.</p>
        <p>''I've heard great things about Yonkers,'' said Ms. Veresova, who has been a teacher in New York City for nine years. ''There's a lot more support for teachers here and better salaries. I live in Tarrytown and it would be a better commute.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Barnett Sturm, superintendent of the Lakeland district, said, ''We're losing teachers to better-paying districts in the county. Money seems to be the driving force.''</p>
        <p>Teachers who move to higher paying districts may earn up to $10,000 more, said Dr. Charles Coletti, district superintendent in Port Chester. ''Middle-year teachers, who've worked for five to seven years in the district, could earn between $8,000 and $10,000 more if they go to a district like Rye, Harrison or Bedford,'' he said.</p>
        <p>What also seems to be happening is that as teachers move to more prestigious districts, districts with lesser status take teachers from other urban districts, which in turn siphon off teachers from New York City.</p>
        <p>''We had a successful retirement incentive, and 5 percent of our experienced teachers left,'' Dr. Coletti said. ''It's a more competitive marketplace, and it's harder and harder to hold on to staff.''</p>
        <p>In this climate, having a candidate accept an offer doesn't necessarily mean that the district has a new hire. ''The other day, I got a call from a young woman I had hired who said that she changed her mind,'' Dr. Castro said. ''We're starting to get a little paranoid.''</p>
        <p>No one is saying that there won't be teachers in classrooms next month, but as Mr. Holmes observed, ''I'm sure there will be some situations where there will be a less experienced person, or someone whose training is not as close a match as would have been hoped for.''</p>
        <p>Still, as Dr. Fox said: ''I know we're doing everything possible. When school starts in September, there will be people in the classroom.''</p>
