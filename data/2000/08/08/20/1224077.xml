        <p>It may be novel for the White Mountains National Forest to play host to wheelchair hikers, but wheelchair users' desire to use wilderness areas is not rare or new (''For These Trailblazers, Wheelchairs Matter,'' front page, Aug. 17).

        <p>It may be novel for the White Mountains National Forest to play host to wheelchair hikers, but wheelchair users' desire to use wilderness areas is not rare or new (''For These Trailblazers, Wheelchairs Matter,'' front page, Aug. 17). People with all types of disabilities have been involved in outdoor recreation for at least two decades. I have been mobility-impaired since birth, yet I have made several wilderness trips.</p>
        <p>At the time of my first trip I had never had any experience in outdoor recreation, but others were veteran outdoors people both before and after acquiring their disabilities.  My fellow travelers have included those with many types of physical, emotional and medical conditions: natural and physical barriers are opportunities for creative improvisation. In all instances, we follow ''minimum impact'' practices to respect the integrity of the environment.</p>
