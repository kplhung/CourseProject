        <p>Three weeks ago, Parks Department officials said they could repair the wooden pilings beneath the Cromwell Recreation Center without closing down the building. Now they are not so sure.</p>
        <p>Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern said the center would close altogether if engineers determine this week that emergency repairs could not be made to the pilings, which have been undermined by borer worms in the harbor. He said the cost of a more thorough repair of the pier, estimated at $11 million to $15 million, might even lead the department to close the center permanently and build a new one on dry land.</p>
        <p>If emergency repairs cannot be made, Mr. Stern said, classes and other programs at the Cromwell Center will be moved to buildings in Parks Department playgrounds in the area. He added that the basketball program would be shifted to courts at local schools, and that dance, aerobics and tai chi classes would move to the Snug Harbor Cultural Center.</p>
        <p>He added that any repairs must be completed before December, when  harsh weather sets in. If not, the department will close the center for safety reasons. Mr. Stern said center members would receive a letter detailing any new changes.</p>
        <p>If the pier needs a thorough renovation, the commissioner is not sure that it would be worth it. ''There are serious questions about whether you would get more recreation center for your money if you didn't have to fight the water every six years,'' he said, referring to a $5.5 million Cromwell renovation in 1994. ''Would it be more sensible to build a state-of-the-art recreation center on dry land?''</p>
