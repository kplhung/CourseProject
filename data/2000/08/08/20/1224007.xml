        <p>LOWER MANHATTAN  Puppet Theater From Vietnam</p>
        <p>Multicolored swans, jumping fish, plumed peacocks, fairies (shown below) and pirouetting dragons that breathe real fire and spout water bring folk stories from Vietnam to life at the Saigon Water Puppet Theater at the Hudson River Festival.</p>
        <p>A colorful temple serves as a backdrop to the hand-crafted puppets as they dance and dart across the bright pool of water, moving to traditional Vietnamese music.</p>
        <p>The puppets are manipulated to tell both mythological tales and tales of daily life from the farming villages of Vietnam by a crew of 15 puppeteers. They hide behind a wooden screen while wading waist deep in the 7,500-gallon pool to manipulate the puppets with underwater rods and wires.</p>
        <p>Saigon Water Puppet Theater at the Hudson River Festival; today, 3 p.m.; World Financial Center Plaza, Liberty Street and Hudson River; free; (212) 528-2733.</p>
        <p>QUEENS  A Singer Who Makes Libraries Lively</p>
        <p>Dispelling the common notion that libraries are places for quiet time, Joe McDermott (pictured at right),  whose performances are anything but quiet, will sing and play guitar for families throughout the week at eight branches of the Queens Borough Library.</p>
        <p>Mr. McDermott won a 1998 Parents' Choice Award for his most recent recording, titled ''I Am Baby.'' The former Montessori teacher, who lives in Austin, Tex., has worked with Stan and Jan Berenstain, the creators of the Berenstain Bears, and has written music for software and video games, including ''Freddie Fish.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McDermott is currently collaborating on a video and compact disc project called ''All Strapped In,'' which involves movements young children can do while in their car seats.</p>
        <p>Joe McDermott; tomorrow  through Thursday at various times and locations of the Queens Borough Library; all events free; full schedule at (718) 990-0778.</p>
