        <p>From hemisphere to hemisphere and around the globe comes news about meat, and it's enough to put you off your feed.</p>
        <p>Take, for instance, the report from Britain, where thousands of pigs have been slaughtered because of an outbreak of swine fever. ''People are at their wits' end,'' lamented James Black, vice chairman of the National Pig Association.</p>
        <p>Last week, the United States joined several European countries in banning imports of live pigs, pig semen and related products from Britain, which is still struggling with huge economic losses from an outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, commonly known as mad cow disease, that began several years ago.</p>
        <p>Swine fever, like mad cow disease, is usually controlled only by the destruction of infected animals. Outbreaks decimated herds in the Netherlands and Germany in recent years.</p>
        <p>But unlike mad cow disease, swine fever is not thought to be a threat to humans. About 50 people in Britain have died from Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, which has been linked to mad cow disease.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, a federal judge ordered two flocks of sheep belonging to a Vermont couple to be destroyed out of concern that they had a version of mad cow disease.</p>
        <p>In Malaysia, about 100 people died last year and a million pigs were slaughtered because of the spread of the newly discovered Nipah virus, which is in the same class of viruses as ebola and AIDS. Researchers recently confirmed a chain of infection from fruit bats to pigs and then to humans.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, an outbreak of hoof-and-mouth disease in Argentina prompted the announcement last week of a temporary halt in beef exports to the United States.</p>
        <p>Bon appetit.</p>
