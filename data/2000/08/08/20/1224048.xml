        <p>Two questions come to mind. If it was clear that as a legislator, Al Gore was ''playing at a very high level of the game'' on arms control, why was there such a dearth of arms reduction deals during this active vice president's eight-year tenure?</p>

        <p>Re ''In Congress, Gore Selected Issues Ready for Prime Time'' (front page, Aug. 13):</p>
        <p>Two questions come to mind. If it was clear that as a legislator, Al Gore was ''playing at a very high level of the game'' on arms control, why was there such a dearth of arms reduction deals during this active vice president's eight-year tenure?</p>
        <p>If Mr. Gore is true to his quote about the message of his Congressional career -- ''I will not hesitate to take on any special interest that is operating to the disadvantage of the American people'' -- one wonders how he squares this with the fact that he used to grow tobacco and supported the tobacco industry through much of his Congressional career.</p>
