        <p>Editors' Note on article in Aug 20 Arts &amp; Leisure by Irini Shostakovich, widow of Dmitri Shostakovich, reflecting on his life; The Times would have acknowledged that article appeared earlier in several Russian publications if it had learned about them in time</p>

        <p>An article on Page 27 of Arts &amp; Leisure today by Irina Shostakovich, widow of the Russian composer Dmitri Shostakovich, reflects on his life and reputation 25 years after his death. The writer made the article available through friends.</p>
        <p>After the section went to press, The Times learned that the article had also been published in Moscow, in slightly abridged versions.</p>
        <p>On Aug. 8, while The Times was preparing its translation, the article appeared in the Russian-language newspaper Moskovskiye Novosti; the next day it was printed by the paper's English-language affiliate, Moscow News, in that paper's own translation. The Times would have acknowledged those versions in the introduction if it had learned about them in time.</p>
