        <p>Following their 27-24 defeat of the Giants on Friday, the Jets are in the unusual position of having two weeks to prepare for the regular-season opener, a scheduling quirk that affords them the chance to get several critical players healthy and to review reams of film.</p>
        <p>Coach Al Groh said yesterday that he had already delved into the rolls of tape that chronicle every defensive play of the preseason -- all 313 of them. He will undoubtedly wince at some of the things he sees. The Jets gave up 1,503 yards, 992 of them on passes.</p>

        <p>Following their 27-24 defeat of the Giants on Friday, the Jets are in the unusual position of having two weeks to prepare for the regular-season opener, a scheduling quirk that affords them the chance to get several critical players healthy and to review reams of film.</p>
        <p>Coach Al Groh said yesterday that he had already delved into the rolls of tape that chronicle every defensive play of the preseason -- all 313 of them. He will undoubtedly wince at some of the things he sees. The Jets gave up 1,503 yards, 992 of them on passes.</p>
        <p>Even more disconcerting is the preponderance of long pass completions. At Green Bay, cornerback Marcus Coleman was beaten by Charles Lee, a rookie from Central Florida, for a 31-yard touchdown reception from the backup quarterback Matt Hasselbeck. Against Baltimore, the Ravens picked up a blitz by Kevin Williams, and Qadry Ismail made a catch over the middle and ran away from Coleman and Victor Green for a 57-yard reception. And Omar Stoutmire, the probable opening-day starter at free safety, was late getting over on Amani Toomer's 73-yard touchdown reception for the Giants. Stoutmire had a particularly tough night. He was involved in all three of the Giants' touchdown catches.</p>
        <p>The free safety spot was one of the big questions entering camp, and Groh had hoped to unearth a clear winner for the position from among Stoutmire, Williams and Scott Frost over the course of four games. No such luck.</p>
        <p>''I don't think it's quite solidified itself the way I hoped it would,'' Groh said. He said that while he had not announced his decision, he had an idea who his starting free safety would be. Since nobody did anything to unseat him, Stoutmire, who was penciled in as the starter, will most likely get the job. But Groh did not exactly praise Stoutmire's work on Friday.</p>
        <p>''He was one of a couple of players in the secondary who I'm sure would have liked to have played a little sharper,'' Groh said.</p>
        <p>The secondary should get a boost because Groh expects the left cornerback, Aaron Glenn, who missed the last two preseason games with a sprained left ankle, to practice this week.</p>
        <p>Groh would not talk at all about his starting lineup, including whether the rookie Shaun Ellis would be the starter at left end when the Jets meet Green Bay on Sept. 3.</p>
        <p>Groh did indicate that Vincent Brisby, who has been with the team all of five days, has already become the Jets' third receiver, largely because he and the starters, Wayne Chrebet and Dedric Ward, have the most experience of the receivers on the roster. That means the brief Jets career of receiver Yatil Green will most likely end soon, because the Jets have to trim 6 of their 71 players to get to the mandated 65-man roster by Tuesday. Groh said he expected to make some cuts today.</p>
        <p>Green, whom the Jets signed days before camp began in hopes that he would fill their need for a big receiver, started slowly, and Groh seemed cool to him after Green talked openly about his history of knee injuries. Green, who did not play in two preseason games, never got a chance to play with the first-team offense, despite having several impressive practices later in camp.</p>
        <p>Against the Giants, Brisby leapfrogged Green -- and the rookie Laveranues Coles, who played at the spot in the preceding three games -- into the role of third receiver.</p>
        <p>Speculation is already rampant that Brisby, who is 6 feet 3 inches and 200 pounds, may soon unseat the 5-9 Ward as the second receiver opposite the entrenched Chrebet.</p>
        <p>Brisby, who joined the team Wednesday, came in on the Jets' second play of the game Friday and had two catches for 30 yards, including an 18-yard reception on third-and-10 in which he waited for the pass on the right sideline as Ray Lucas made the throw under pressure.</p>
        <p>Why did Brisby get the nod over Green, who did not have a catch in the preseason?</p>
        <p>''Because he's a proven pro football player as opposed to a guy who has been in eight games,'' Groh said.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Quarterback VINNY TESTAVERDE had swelling in his left big toe after Wednesday's practice, and the swelling did not subside enough by Friday to allow him to play. But Coach AL GROH said that had Testaverde's toe been in good shape, he would have played him. ''As it was, given what had occurred in Vinny's week, I thought it had been a successful week,'' Groh said. ''He got a lot more work than he had been expected to be able to do.'' . . . Running back BERNIE PARMALEE (foot), who did not play at all in the preseason, is expected to return to practice this week. The Jets continue to be on the lookout for running backs to back up CURTIS MARTIN, although Groh says the Jets are not involved in any serious trade talks.</p>
