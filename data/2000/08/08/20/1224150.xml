        <p>When President Clinton crisscrossed Africa on a six-country visit in March 1998, his plane overflew Nigeria in a pointed snub at the generals leading it. Ground down by misrule and miscreants, Nigeria, the continent's most populous nation, was an ailing giant perilously close to collapse.</p>
        <p>On his second trip to Africa next weekend, Mr. Clinton's main destination will be Nigeria, which under the elected civilian government of Olusegun Obasanjo, who took power just 15 months ago, has undergone one of Africa's most stunning and convulsive political transformations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton rhapsodized about a renaissance on his last visit to Africa. Nowadays, no one mentions the leaders he heralded then as beacons of Africa's rebirth: only months after his trip, the leaders of Uganda, Rwanda, Ethiopia and Eritrea all went to war, against one another, from the Horn of Africa to Congo.</p>
        <p>The hopes of Washington, and the West, now rest largely with Mr. Obasanjo and Nigeria. As he tries to restore freedom and bring some measure of Nigeria's immense wealth to its overwhelmingly poor people, Mr. Obasanjo must contend with secessionist tendencies, the spreading imposition of Muslim law in the north, rampant corruption and decades of neglect of the infrastructure that should hold his country together.</p>
        <p>Mr. Obasanjo's performance has been mixed. Faced with the declaration of Shariah, the Islamic legal code, in eight northern states, he has reacted cautiously and called for a political solution to the challenge of Islamic extremism. Yet he ordered soldiers to destroy a town in the oil-producing Niger Delta. His initial crackdown on corruption went far and wide, but his own aides have engaged in old-style influence peddling.</p>
        <p>He has called himself a true believer in democracy and appears to have reined in the military, but he has surrounded himself with weak ministers and has little regard for the National Assembly.</p>
        <p>As daunting as his problems are his potential assets: 113 million people above ground and billions of barrels of crude oil underground. On the continent with the world's richest natural resources and poorest people, Nigeria has so much oil that it may eventually rank second only to Saudi Arabia, but its inhabitants have one of the lowest standards of living. On a continent riven by cleavages among ethnic groups, Nigeria has the most, perhaps as many as 400.</p>
        <p>Nigeria is home to Lagos, a reeling, clogged metropolis that is yet Africa's most thrilling city. It is a country that has given birth to some of Africa's most resonant music and literature, yet it is also a place where only 1 in 270 people has a telephone. The National Electric Power Authority -- whose initials are also said to stand for Never Expect Power Anytime -- is so unreliable that several nationwide blackouts have occurred in recent months. Long lines at gas stations -- the iconic image of a country of corrupt leaders and suffering masses -- have recently reappeared.</p>
        <p>There is little sense here -- even less than elsewhere in Africa -- that politicians can improve the lives of ordinary Africans. The politicians, said Uti Akpan, 30, a textiles trader in Lagos, ''have abandoned the schools because their children do not go to schools here.''</p>
        <p>''We are hungry, but they carry our money and go and invest outside,'' he said. ''If there's democracy here, we don't know.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Obasanjo, a retired general who is the West's new darling in Africa, seems resolved to try to improve the lives of Nigerians, even if he may find it as hard as previous leaders have to look beyond the big gated villa that is Abuja, Nigeria's spanking new capital, to the sprawling diversity and violent strife that lie beyond.</p>
        <p>In tranquil Abuja, planted in the sparsely populated heart of the country as a neutral zone, the troubles of the nation that has long represented both Africa's highest hopes and deepest despair seem unimaginable.</p>
        <p>Drive two hours north to Kaduna, however, and the despair is on stark display. In a city that once had a cosmopolitan tone and religious integration, where the political and military elite used to spend their weekends playing polo, riots killed thousands of residents this year, and neighborhoods reduced to rubble have become segregated between Muslims and Christians. ''If we want to get proper peace in Kaduna, we have to divide the state into two,'' Simeon Achi, 61, a Christian community leader, said inside his house there. ''Let them go to the north and let our people go to the south.''</p>
        <p>To the northwest, in Zamfara, the first state to adopt Shariah this year, motorcycle taxi drivers have been whipped or caned for carrying women. A cow thief's hand was chopped off.</p>
        <p>''Sure,'' said Mahmud Aliyu Shinkafi, the state's deputy governor, when asked whether his government would continue cutting off hands. ''It's a deterrent.'' Just outside his office, workers were building a mosque in this officially secular country.</p>
        <p>At the other extreme of this vast country, in the mangrove swamps of the Niger Delta, people are threatening to take up arms to form their own republic -- so that all the country's oil would become theirs.</p>
        <p>''Every ethnic nationality in this country now has a focus on where it wants to go if the nation disintegrates,'' said Bello Orubebe, a lawyer in the oil city of Warri.</p>
        <p>A Convert to Democracy</p>
        <p>For most of the 1990's, under the dictator Gen. Sani Abacha, Nigeria was an international pariah. But for its oil, the West would most likely have forgotten it altogether.</p>
        <p>Then, in June 1998, General Abacha mysteriously died. His successor, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, surprisingly decided to restore civilian rule. And in May 1999 power passed to Mr. Obasanjo, a man much admired abroad for having relinquished power in 1979 after three years as a military ruler and viewed at home as a possible unifier of this almost impossible country.</p>
        <p>He is a Christian from the south in a country traditionally dominated by Muslims from the north, yet has the respect of that northern elite; he is a former absolute ruler who, in the three years he spent in jail under General Abacha's rule, is said to have become both a convinced democrat and a born-again Christian.</p>
        <p>The shaky democracy over which Mr. Obasanjo presides has been tested severely despite the new openness. Still, the center has held so far -- although in so fragile a fashion that President Clinton will spend his two days in Nigeria only in Abuja, for security reasons.</p>
        <p>''Nigeria and the transition there is of huge importance,'' said a Clinton administration official in Washington. ''Given its size and its potential role in stabilizing and democratizing Africa, Nigeria represents a huge opportunity for our own interests in Africa and also a huge challenge to us.''</p>
        <p>In the last two years, Nigeria has risen from receiving nearly nothing in American aid to being at the top in sub-Saharan Africa: $109 million for general aid -- still less than $1 for every Nigerian -- as well as $10 million to reform its military and about $50 million to train and equip its soldiers for peacekeeping operations in West Africa.</p>
        <p>The United States wants Nigeria to play an increasing security role and to help America resist calls to intervene in places like Sierra Leone. And so within this short period Nigeria has gone from untouchable to being, along with South Africa, one of Washington's two most important partners in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
        <p>Much of the West's hope for Nigeria lies in its leader, Mr. Obasanjo.</p>
        <p>Although his earlier presidency was marred by widespread corruption and human rights abuses, he relinquished power voluntarily in 1979, becoming the first general to do so and earning the lasting respect of Western leaders like President Carter. What is more, when the newly oil-rich Nigeria saw itself in the 1970's as Africa's leader, General Obasanjo was one of the leaders of pan-Africanism.</p>
        <p>Under General Abacha, Mr. Obasanjo was jailed in 1995 on a trumped-up charge of attempting a coup. After the general's sudden death, Mr. Obasanjo was released and soon declared his candidacy for president.</p>
        <p>The Hausa-speaking Muslim military elite, who have controlled Nigeria for most of its 40 years of independence, trusted Mr. Obasanjo even though he was a Christian Yoruba. The southwestern Yoruba and the northern Hausa are two of the country's three main ethnic groups; the third is the southeastern Ibo. The military elite bankrolled his campaign to an easy, if not altogether transparent, victory in February 1999. As Mr. Obasanjo prepared to take over in May 1999, he remained a giant question mark. Would he be a stooge of the north or his own man? Would he be a democrat his second time in power?</p>
        <p>Onukaba Adinoyi-Ojo, who was appointed managing director of The Daily Times, a  state-owned newspaper, by Mr. Obasanjo last year, said the president was converted to civilian rule after his first term.</p>
        <p>''He's not a reluctant democrat,'' said Mr. Adinoyi-Ojo, who has been a protege of Mr. Obasanjo since the early 1980's. ''Over the years he interacted with a lot of world leaders and saw that democracy was more beneficial. When he was imprisoned by Abacha, he never thought that could happen to him after having attained his position in Nigeria. He saw that only democracy could protect everyone's rights.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, immediately after taking over, Mr. Obasanjo flushed the military of its politically ambitious senior officers, set up investigations into corruption and human rights abuses and, describing himself as a ''detribalized politician,'' appointed officials from diverse ethnicities in the military, ministries and his cabinet. The north, used to a monopoly on power, felt betrayed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Obasanjo's decision to become a born-again Christian ''has made him approach government with a messianic attitude,'' Mr. Adinoyi-Ojo said. ''He sees his second coming as a call from God as if he were a Messiah come to save this country. That's made him impatient. He's domineering. There's almost an I-know-it-all kind of attitude. Some feel he doesn't consult widely. I think he's aware of that fact.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Obasanjo's failings have been overlooked by foreign governments. Restive Nigerians tend to swing to the other extreme nowadays, giving Mr. Obasanjo credit for little and seemingly forgetting the genuine strides during his administration.</p>
        <p>''The mere fact that Obasanjo has been able to hold this country together is praiseworthy,'' said Hakeem B. Harunah, a historian at the University of Lagos.</p>
        <p>Lagos, the political capital until two decades ago and the focal point of the opposition to the military, had felt the army's clamps more than any other corner of Nigeria.</p>
        <p>Grinding Poverty the Norm</p>
        <p>''There's a kind of freedom that we now enjoy,'' said Soji Omotunde, 45, a publicist who was browsing recently in a bookstore in the neighborhood of Ikeja. ''In spite of the political upheavals which are the product of a lack of democracy, we are on a path to survival.''</p>
        <p>And yet, having grown used to the idea of greater freedom, most Nigerians now mention it as an afterthought. Instead, they focus on how their daily lives have otherwise not changed: despite the billions of dollars this country earns each year from oil, most Nigerians live in grinding poverty.</p>
        <p>Lagos reels daily, dragged down by the weight of its estimated eight million inhabitants, collapsing roads and an undercurrent of violence. Only the great Nigerian spirit -- of ''suffering and smiling'' at the same time, as the late Afrobeat musician Fela Anikulapo-Kuti described it -- lifts up Lagos's squalid slums and gaudy mansions into what is perhaps Africa's most vibrant city.</p>
        <p>Persuading Nigerians that a democracy can keep improving their lives remains a race against time for Mr. Obasanjo. Generals have long used the public's lack of confidence in politicians as an excuse to seize and keep power. Nigeria's last experiment with civilian rule, which began in 1979,  ended in 1983 because politicians proved altogether corrupt and incompetent.</p>
        <p>Some worry that the continuing shambles in Abuja will produce a repeat of the past. National Assembly members have exerted most of their energies in the last year on matters like obtaining allowances to buy furniture for their state-furnished private homes. In the end, senators who had been granted $35,000 to buy furniture awarded themselves $50,000 -- in cash. This month the Senate president, Chuba Okadigbo, No. 3 in government, was impeached after an internal investigation found that he had awarded himself $370,000 for furniture and $220,000 as a Christmas bonus.</p>
        <p>Nigeria now has its third Senate president in a year. The first had to resign after lying about his age and academic record; the first House speaker, No. 4 in the government, suffered a similar fate for the same reasons. Both allies of Mr. Obasanjo, they had been elected to their positions after his aides handed out bags of money to lawmakers to secure their votes, congressmen and senators acknowledge privately.</p>
        <p>The practice has come to be known as ''Ghana-must-go'' politics -- after the huge multicolored bags that illegal Ghanaian immigrants used when they were expelled from Nigeria in the early 1980's. In the National Assembly, the bags were needed to carry the bricks of notes of the local currency, the naira, of which the largest denomination until recently was worth only 50 cents.</p>
        <p>''What baffled me is that even the money recovered from Abacha has been stolen,'' said Mr. Akpan, the Lagos textiles trader. ''If you recover money from a thief and you go back and steal the money, it means you are worse than the thief.''</p>
        <p>A small part of the $5 billion estimated to have been stolen by General Abacha has been recovered from overseas accounts, but the amount has been loosely controlled once back in Nigeria.</p>
        <p>The economy remains stagnant, partly because of the government's failure to privatize important sectors like the telephone industry. Nigeria's economy, like those of most African nations, still remains tightly controlled by the state.</p>
        <p>''Everyone is still trying to live off government patronage,'' said Kenneth Enahoro, 47, a businessman and the son of a prominent politician, Anthony Enahoro. ''The economy was destroyed by the long years of irresponsible military rule. It's going to take honest work to try and resuscitate the economy and give food to the man on the street, without relying on government handouts.''</p>
        <p>The Ever-Present Nightmare</p>
        <p>After its vigorous start, the Obasanjo administration became bogged down by the various forces fueling the country's anger. Certain things have remained constant since British colonialists created it in 1914: a breakup has always been a nightmare, one that came close in 1967 when the Ibo tried to secede in the war of Biafra. A million Nigerians died.</p>
        <p>With the military out of power, the country's sectarian and separatist forces have hit Mr. Obasanjo with full might. Out of favor, powerful northerners have challenged him by encouraging the spread of Shariah. In Kaduna, the possibility that it would be enforced led to deadly clashes between Christians and Muslims.</p>
        <p>''You cannot have a country that is ruled by one law and, once you travel one hour away, by a different law,'' said Yohanna Madaki, a Christian lawyer, retired colonel and former military governor. With soldiers off the streets, ethnic-based vigilante groups have mushroomed.</p>
        <p>''People don't feel that they can rely on the government for protection, so they are going outside the system,'' said Ozonnia Ojielo, a lawyer at the Center for Conflict Resolution and Peace Advocacy, a private organization in Lagos. ''The result is that all these vigilante groups have created a sense of lawlessness.''</p>
        <p>This sense of looming anarchy resurrected the military ruler in Mr. Obasanjo late last year. When clashes occurred in Lagos involving a Yoruba extremist group he ordered that its members be ''shot on sight.''</p>
        <p>Around the same time, 12 police officers were killed in the Niger Delta by inhabitants of a town called Odi. Hundreds of troops sent by Mr. Obasanjo flattened Odi and killed countless innocent people. The president later expressed regret, but the good will he had earned by visiting the delta soon after his inauguration evaporated.</p>
        <p>''We thought a civilian regime would bring us succor,'' said Mr. Orubebe, the lawyer in Warri, perhaps the most unlivable city in West Africa. Its streets are forever choked with cars and motorcycles and a thick bluish haze hangs in the air. Mountains of garbage, dumped helter-skelter, had grown so high recently that several streets were blocked off.</p>
        <p>Mr. Orubebe spoke at dusk. After night fell, Warri reached its full surreal power. Surrounded by towering oil company gas flares that lit the sky, the city itself, lacking electricity, sank into darkness. Candles flickered along narrow streets in the center of town, where the shadows of thousands of people darted in and out of traffic and engine fumes mingled with the smoke from roadside cooking fires and burning garbage.</p>
        <p>The obverse of Warri is Abuja, a city of new villas and wide traffic-free streets, where the building cranes in the sky point to the destination of the delta's oil money. Leaders from Sierra Leone to Congo to Angola have plundered Africa's riches, stashing the money away in Switzerland and erecting sprawling gated villas, where they live guarded by armed men. Nigeria has perhaps Africa's biggest villas.</p>
        <p>Whether its new leaders will really look beyond the villa gates remains unclear.</p>
        <p>At a forum this week to foster better relations between the executive and legislative branches, Mr. Obasanjo castigated lawmakers, accusing them of neglecting their duties and focusing on obtaining government contracts. The lawmakers shot back that they had rooted out corruption by removing the Senate leadership.</p>
        <p>Lynda Chuba Ikpeazu, 34, a congresswoman, accused Mr. Obasanjo of continually undermining the legislature so that he could enjoy a ''civilian dictatorship.''</p>
        <p>Still, in these quarrels, Ms. Ikpeazu saw the noisy workings of a young democracy. In the halls of the new National Assembly building here and in Lagos's flourishing media, Nigerians are arguing, clamoring, challenging. ''One year can't do much,'' Ms. Ikpeazu said. ''The important thing is that we have laid the foundation.''</p>
