        <p>For years now, it has become almost routine to blame whatever is going wrong with the Giants on the offense. But in the 2000 season, as promised, these are the new-look Giants.</p>
        <p>After Friday night's shabby performance in a 27-24 loss to the Jets, that means there's a fresh place to look when placing blame after a debacle.</p>
        <p>The offense had its share of problems -- the unit committed 11 of the preposterous 16 Giants penalties in the game. But it moved the football, scoring three touchdowns. The offense was 13 yards short of accumulating 500 yards in offense.</p>
        <p>It was the Giants' once-proud defense that appeared particularly in disarray. From front line to back line, there not only wasn't cohesion, there was confusion.</p>
        <p>It is only the preseason, but Michael Strahan has half a sack after three games, and there has been too little pressure applied on the quarterback from his linemates. Linebacker Jessie Armstead is playing ably but not dominating. His new soul mate in the middle, Mike Barrow, made his debut for the Giants Friday and was trapped out of the play repeatedly on draws up the middle. The secondary played a step behind the Jets' smaller, quicker receivers and disregarded their coverage assignments, too.</p>
        <p>Again, it is only the preseason, but the Jets, led by their backup quarterback, Ray Lucas, ran just 57 plays Friday night and still gained 446 yards. That's an average of 7.8 yards per play -- 10 yards per pass play and 5.7 per rushing play.</p>
        <p>And while the Giants, who are without a victory in the preseason, pointed to the team's reserves for their troubles before Friday's game, it was the starters who gave up nearly 80 percent of the yardage and the scoring against the Jets.</p>
        <p>The Giants' defensive players are still a confident lot, and they were somewhat defiant after the game, insisting they are still a top defense in the National Football League.</p>
        <p>''I'm not going to push the panic button,'' defensive tackle Keith Hamilton said. ''I still feel good about the defense. It doesn't change anything.''</p>
        <p>But the Giants look a long way from their form in 1997, when they were the third-best N.F.L. defense against the run and opposing offenses averaged 3.4 yards per rushing carry and 4.7 yards per play.</p>
        <p>Since defensive end is one of the most pivotal positions on the field, it is hard not to wonder what has happened to Strahan, who had 29 sacks in 1997 and 1998, but 5.5 last season. So far this year, he has not displayed a return to his old form.</p>
        <p>Strahan has not been particularly forthcoming about the drop. After Friday's game he told reporters: ''Don't be coming over here with those questions. You're just trying to tick me off.''</p>
        <p>But Strahan, who had four tackles and a fumble recovery Friday, acknowledged there is a different feel about this defense than the one that seemed on the rise in 1997. ''We're definitely not as comfortable a defense as we were back in '97,'' he said. ''But we're learning to play together. We're going to be fine -- I hope. Let's be lucky it didn't count.''</p>
        <p>Coach Jim Fassel wasn't taking the situation with the same aplomb.</p>
        <p>''I don't think we've gotten a pass rush all preseason,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Fassel said he may look at more unconventional ways to improve the pass run, which means more blitzing. But when teams blitz, they leave receivers in single coverage and the Giants' secondary hardly looks ready to handle that.</p>
        <p>Right cornerback Jason Sehorn made one mistake that gave the Jets a touchdown, though he played solidly after that. The left cornerback, Dave Thomas, was picked on repeatedly by Lucas, who frequently started looking to that side of the field from the moment he started dropping back in the pocket.</p>
        <p>This could easily be the strategy used by Giants opponents for the rest of the year, which means Thomas may need help from the safeties. But free safety Shaun Williams hasn't played yet because of a sprained toe, and strong safety Sam Garnes was fooled just as Thomas was on the run fake part of a flea-flicker that became the second Jets touchdown.</p>
        <p>This, too, could be a recurring problem for the Giants because both Garnes and Thomas are strong against the run and less skilled in pass coverage.</p>
        <p>Barrow's middling play could be chalked up to his unfamiliarity with his new teammates. Armstead, however, is counted on for his stellar play. If he does not excel once the regular season begins, there will be new questions about the health of Armstead's right knee, which troubled him last season.</p>
        <p>It is just one preseason game, but it gave the Giants evidence there is plenty to fix -- on the defensive side of the ball, for a change.</p>
        <p>''It's very frustrating to look at the talent and potential we have on defense and to see us play that way,'' Sehorn said. ''When you see all those breakdowns you say, 'What were we practicing all that other stuff for?' We've got a lot of work to do to prove ourselves again.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>JIM FASSEL said free safety SHAUN WILLIAMS (sprained toe) will not play in the Giants' final preseason game Friday against Baltimore, meaning Williams will have missed the entire preseason schedule. Williams has never started an N.F.L. game at free safety, a position where instinct and familiarity with teammates is essential. . . . The special-teams coverage units improved Friday. The rookie RON DIXON had a 51-yard kickoff return and TIKI BARBER a 15-yard punt return that he was one broken tackle away from turning into a 95-yard touchdown.</p>
