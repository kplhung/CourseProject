        <p>Once upon a cold war, presidential candidates competed to see who could be trusted not to blink, sitting across the table from a determined Soviet leader.</p>
        <p>Post Clinton, presidential candidates compete to see who can be trusted not to blink, standing across the desk from a determined White House intern.</p>
        <p>Watching both conventions, it is obvious that the threat is not missiles. The threat is missies. The man we elect to occupy the Oval Office must have steady nerves and steely resolve in case he faces a ''Fail Safe'' moment -- not a thermonuclear crisis but a thong crisis.</p>
        <p>That is why convention stages have turned into lovers' lanes. In Philadelphia and L.A., the nominees were determined to prove their uxoriousness.</p>
        <p>So the candidates and their wives cooed, cuddled and smooched. Yuck!</p>
        <p>They showed videos of themselves canoodling and getting connubial. Ick!</p>
        <p>And they had a lot of lovey-dovey talk in the speeches. Gross!</p>
        <p>The weighty platform sessions of yore have been superseded by prime-time podium make-out sessions.</p>
        <p>In the good old days of Mamie and Jackie and Nancy, wives waved and smiled silently. Now wives have major convention roles, delivering gooey paeans to their husbands, about how lovable and trustworthy they are.</p>
        <p>In Philadelphia, W. was the anti-Clinton, missing no chance to convey his faithfulness as a husband and father. Laura Bush, a.k.a. the Best Decision He Ever Made, opened the convention with a speech stuffed with allusions to her happy marriage and W.'s homebody ways.</p>
        <p>The R.N.C. showed a gauzy video of W. and Laura. Its emotional apogee was a fetching photo of W., reformed scamp, cradling his infant daughters with a radiant smile.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Bush signaled he'd restore ''dignity and honor'' to the White House, the closed captioning could have read: ''You won't catch me messin' with a filly in the Oval Office.''</p>
        <p>After Philadelphia's ''Scenes From a Marriage,'' Al Gore felt compelled to one-up his rival with ''Love Story, the Convention.'' The vice president, who once claimed he and Tipper were the models for the Erich Segal novel, even brought in Tommy Lee Jones, his old Harvard roommate who appeared in the 1970 movie of ''Love Story,'' to reprise his role as a pal who hangs out with the besotted lovers.</p>
        <p>The craggy actor offered this testimonial about Al and Tipper: ''To this day, when they come to our house, they sit in each other's lap, hold hands, and even smooch occasionally, like the kids they've always been.''</p>
        <p>Introducing her husband, Tipper called him ''the man I love'' and gurgled: ''And listen, did I mention I have loved him for more than 30 years? And from first sight?''</p>
        <p>Tipper's family photo album included many of her own intime shots of Al lathered up and shaving and bare-chested. There was picture after picture of the handsome young couple,  one in bikini and bathing trunks. The montage had an important political message: Al and I have always been hot for each other and we still are, so don't worry about any Monicas.</p>
        <p>When Al joined Tipper on stage, he grabbed her for a long, intense kiss more suited to a third date than the fourth night of a convention, which caused a chain reaction with Joe and Hadassah starting to lip-lock.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's acceptance speech began with an ode to marital devotion.  He then rhapsodized about his parents' close marriage, offering marital fidelity as part of his genetic coding.</p>
        <p>When he promised ''I will never let you down,'' the closed captioning should have read: ''No pizza gals in my Oval Office.''</p>
        <p>We knew the Republicans would make the leitmotif of the election a  promise to remove the stain of tawdry sex from the White House.</p>
        <p>We knew the Democrats were worried that the election would be a referendum on Bill Clinton's revelry. Their worst fears seemed to come true Thursday, when word spread through the hall that Robert Ray, the independent counsel who replaced Kenneth Starr, was inanely reconvening the Starr chamber on whether Mr. Clinton had lied about his dalliance.</p>
        <p>But we did not know how profoundly this would shape the race, from Mr. Gore's choice of Joe Lieberman, who had excoriated Mr. Clinton as ''immoral,'' to the kissy-face conventions.</p>
        <p>It was a measure of how exhibitionist the race had become when the tabloid TV show ''Extra'' did a segment on The Kiss, calling it ''Al's Big Mouth Move,'' and advising the Gores to ''Get a Room!''</p>
