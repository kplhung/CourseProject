        <p>IT started a year ago.</p>
        <p>''We lost in the state tournament then, finishing fourth,'' said Bill Pesature, manager of the Brewster Little League girls' softball team. ''Our girls were mostly 11, against 12-year-olds. For this season, our quest was to win the state championship.''</p>

        <p>IT started a year ago.</p>
        <p>''We lost in the state tournament then, finishing fourth,'' said Bill Pesature, manager of the Brewster Little League girls' softball team. ''Our girls were mostly 11, against 12-year-olds. For this season, our quest was to win the state championship.''</p>
        <p>Quest accomplished, and surpassed. After winning the district, sectional and state tournaments, the Brewster girls stormed though the Eastern Regionals in Delaware, finishing with a do-or-die finals victory over Pennsylvania nine days ago.</p>
        <p>They competed last week in the Little League Softball World Series in Portland, Ore. They lost to the favored South squad the first night, then rebounded with back-to-back victories to ensure that they would be playing into the weekend.</p>
        <p>''The whole experience has been a wonderful thing,'' said Ann Schramek, whose daughter Kiersten is a pitcher.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pesature said: ''They're a special group. They have a unique love for the game. Last year they were a baby team, and they knew they could do better this time, and they worked at it.''</p>
        <p>Did they ever.</p>
        <p>''We practice almost every day,'' Mr. Pesature said. ''And just before the state tournament, I offered them a day off. They had been practicing or playing every day for weeks. I said, 'Girls, you've worked hard, you've earned a day off.' But the team met and they said they wanted to practice.''</p>
        <p>Of all softball's skills, defense is the one most improved by constant practice. ''Our defense is outstanding, the best of any team we've seen,'' Mr. Pasture said.</p>
        <p>''Against Maine in the regionals, we pulled three double plays -- three in six innings, which is what the games are,'' he said. ''That takes a lot of starch out of budding rallies.</p>
        <p>''Different players pick us up. It's been that way all season. Courtney Campbell had a lot of big hits in Delaware. With good defense, timely hitting and good pitching, you're competitive in every game.''</p>
        <p>''Having fun was important,'' said Mr. Pesature. ''One day we went to the beach. I told them to bring their gloves and have a catch. That would count as practice.''</p>
        <p>Kiersten Schramek, with an elaborate motion and a blazing underhand fastball, anchored the pitching, contributing two no-hitters and many low-hit victories.</p>
        <p>Kayla Goff, who pitched at the nationals despite a hip injury, has made important strides as a pitcher. ''She's moved up a couple of notches,'' Mr. Pesature said. ''That's probably the biggest improvement in this team from last year.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, early in the regionals, Kiersten and Kayla threw back-to-back one-hitters. As the coach, Russ Goff, Kayla's father, said, ''Having two very good pitchers kind of separates us from other teams.''</p>
        <p>So perhaps does the dedication of the coaching staff. With a break during the Delaware competition, the team came home for two days. On his one full free day, Mr. Pesature, instead of relaxing, spent time warming up his No. 3 pitcher so she would not get rusty. Gina Dolce ended up the winning pitcher in the semifinal game.</p>
        <p>The girls are not imposing in stature.</p>
        <p>''We're always the smallest team at a tournament,'' Kiersten said. She is 5-foot-2 and 110 pounds -- ''Scrawny,'' she said. Her batterymate, Katie Pesature, has her by perhaps half an inch and a pound. And Kayla is 4-foot-11 and 75 pounds.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pesature said: ''They're not big, but they're a very tight-knit group. They're all friends, and they all go to Henry Wells Middle School together.''</p>
        <p>They play together, they hang out together and they dance together. Cherylann Sangalli said: ''We do a victory dance in a circle after each victory, the banana dance. Kristen Gallipani taught us. She got the idea last year, when we only made it to the states.''</p>
        <p>Practice, success and togetherness have forged a confidence rare in 12-year-olds.</p>
        <p>Katie said: ''Nervous? Nope. Not even in the nationals. I don't get nervous.''</p>
        <p>Kayla said: ''Pressure? This all seems cool.''</p>
        <p>Kiersten said: ''I like to be the one to pick the team up.''</p>
        <p>Their confidence was severely tested twice in the regional. First in the semifinals, Maryland scored six runs in the top of the sixth to take a 9-to-7 lead. The Brewster girls responded with three runs in their last at-bat for a 10-to-9 victory, Samantha Chin driving in the final two runners with a line drive over the left fielder's head.</p>
        <p>Then in the final, the Brewster girls lost to Pennsylvania, 7 to 1, their first defeat of the tournament. This set up a playoff game 45 minutes later; Brewster won, 14 to 4, getting 12 runs in its last three at-bats.</p>
        <p>Courtney Campbell, with two doubles that drove in five runs in those last three innings, earned the most valuable player award in Delaware. Kristen Gallipani and Jillian Piacquadio also had seven hits each in the regional.</p>
        <p>Tiffany Storms, a left fielder, is one of two 11-year-olds on the team. She was not with the squad last year and thus can offer a newcomer's perspective.</p>
        <p>''I was really impressed with how much skill the girls have,'' she said. ''And how well they work together. Basically, they are a family.''</p>
        <p>A family that travels in a caravan of players, coaches, parents, siblings and relatives to tournaments. A family that took over a block of rooms at a budget motel in Millsboro, Del., for the regionals and had pizza parties when not playing or practicing. A family that has invited beaten competitors to their post-game socials and laughed together. A family in which girls have grown into confident athletes.</p>
        <p>Perhaps Mr. Goff put it best. ''Two years ago we started with caterpillars,'' he said. ''Now we have butterflies.''</p>
