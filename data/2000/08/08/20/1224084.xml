        <p>Neil Matthews is an old pro at helping companies out of sticky situations. Growing up in Bristol, England, he worked for a company that scraped chewing gum off the floor of a disco.</p>
        <p>After spending 10 years with Jani-King, a commercial cleaner in the United States, Mr. Matthews, 45, has come full circle as chief operating officer of GumBusters North America, based in Falls Church, Va., and selling franchises since June.</p>
        <p>In Europe, Gumbusters, a subsidiary of InnoConcepts Group, a publicly held company based in Amsterdam, has been dislodging discarded chewing gum for five years. It is now looking to clean up America.</p>
        <p>Clients include Cedar Point Amusement  Parks, in Sandusky, Ohio; Georgetown University and the National Aquarium in Baltimore, where the facilities director, Bonnie Howell, saw workers show up in white suits splattered with the company's logo.</p>
        <p>Mr. Matthews said the technology has come a long way since 1971, when he used a knife. ''It took forever and all you got were big blisters on your hands,'' he said. Using a combination of steam and chemicals, he said, GumBusters can do the job in five seconds.</p>
