        <p>WHEN Robert F. Juliano arrived at the Connecticut Department of Transportation, Bradley Airport in Windsor Locks was a single terminal surrounded by tobacco fields. There were no security fences or checkpoints and only a few domestic carriers servicing the field, which is about 20 minutes north of Hartford.</p>
        <p>''At that time, we were hoping to get up to a million and a half passengers,'' said Mr. Juliano, who is now the chief of the department's Bureau of Aviation and Ports. ''Now, we're probably going to break seven million this year.'' In June, almost 646,000 passengers arrived at or departed from Bradley, up 26.5 percent from a year earlier.</p>

        <p>WHEN Robert F. Juliano arrived at the Connecticut Department of Transportation, Bradley Airport in Windsor Locks was a single terminal surrounded by tobacco fields. There were no security fences or checkpoints and only a few domestic carriers servicing the field, which is about 20 minutes north of Hartford.</p>
        <p>''At that time, we were hoping to get up to a million and a half passengers,'' said Mr. Juliano, who is now the chief of the department's Bureau of Aviation and Ports. ''Now, we're probably going to break seven million this year.'' In June, almost 646,000 passengers arrived at or departed from Bradley, up 26.5 percent from a year earlier.</p>
        <p>Airport and business officials hope that a $200 million expansion under way that will add a terminal, concourse and parking garage will not only accommodate the airport's double-digit growth but also make Bradley International Airport, as it is now known, a portal to more international destinations. The airport now has regular flights to Canada and charters to the Caribbean.</p>
        <p>''If Bradley could draw the same percentage of international travel as it does domestic travel in its market area, it would have 600,000 passengers a year going to Europe; that would be enough for four flights a day,'' said Dean B. Hill, executive vice president of Campbell Hill Aviation Group in Alexandria, Va., a consulting firm. ''Bradley's share of domestic flights is already growing far beyond national average. That shows Bradley is attractive when the services are there. We'll use that when we talk to international carriers.''</p>
        <p>Local officials, meanwhile, say that Bradley has become the driver of the economy in the former farming communities that surround it and they are hopeful that the expansion will bring more development.</p>
        <p>Edward A. Ferrari, a Windsor Locks first selectman, said that since the 1960's the airport had attracted chain restaurants, hotels, parking services, gas stations and other services. But two years ago, Federal Express opened a large operation there, and the town is talking with a large trucking company that wants to put in a terminal and a developer who has proposed a conference center.</p>
        <p>''It's going to have a gigantic spinoff effect for the town,'' Mr. Ferrari said.  ''We're constantly looking and talking. Those are the kind of projects that we're trying to woo into town.''</p>
        <p>Peter M. Gioia, an economist with the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, said that the economic impact from Bradley's expansion reached throughout Connecticut. One study, by the University of Connecticut Center for Economic Analysis, found that for every million passengers, Bradley generated $100 million in economic activity for the state and created 2,500 jobs.</p>
        <p>''If I were to create a list of things that have a significant potential economic upside for Connecticut, Bradley is going to be right at the top,'' Mr. Gioia said.</p>
        <p>Bradley, which opened during World War II as a military airfield, is named for Lt. Eugene Morris Bradley, who died in a training accident there on Aug. 21, 1941. The first commercial flight was in 1947, and the airport came under state control in 1948.</p>
        <p>The last major modernization project was in 1982, when the state spent $100 million to add a new terminal and concourse and other improvements. Since then, airport use has grown considerably -- to five million passengers in 1995 and this year's expected seven million.</p>
        <p>MUCH of that has been due to what the Federal Aviation Administration has called the Southwest effect. Southwest Airlines began offering service from Bradley last October, bringing its no-hassle low-fare philosophy to a market that was previously known for high prices. Since then, the airport estimates that the average unrestricted air fare has dropped 32 percent, as other carriers have scrambled to compete.</p>
        <p>''Hartford has met all of our projections and is growing,'' said Whitney Brewer, a Southwest spokeswoman. Southwest is now operating 12 daily nonstop flights to Baltimore, Chicago, Nashville and Orlando.</p>
        <p>A new terminal complex will be 521,000 square feet with 34 gates, compared with 24 gates in slightly less than 446,000 square feet of terminal space now. There will also be a dedicated two-gate international section. Most of the new and renovated space will be completed in 2002, Mr. Juliano said.</p>
        <p>A new garage will provide 3,453 new parking spaces, with 1,655 spaces set for completion next May and the rest a year later.</p>
        <p>Mr. Juliano said the expansion was needed just to accommodate the growth that has already taken place. Since 1995, 8 new carriers have come into Bradley, and the number of nonstop destinations has increased to 41 from 27 -- more than 300 nonstop flights a day leave Bradley now. Seasonal slowdowns have disappeared: passenger traffic has grown for 27 straight months.</p>
        <p>''People talk about Bradley getting to the next level,'' Mr. Juliano said. ''Well, it is at the next level. You have just about every domestic service you can ask for, and the frequency of flights has gone up dramatically.''</p>
        <p>When the project is completed, Bradley will be able to handle 12 million passengers a year. Andre J. Libert, director of marketing for the airport, said he expected the expanded and improved airport to draw from as far as mid-Vermont to the north and to make inroads even into New York City.</p>
        <p>''We're seeing Westchester County traffic in numbers we've never seen before, Stamford and Greenwich in numbers that we have never seen before,'' Mr. Libert said.</p>
        <p>A decade ago, Fairfield County travelers represented about 2.5 percent of the business at Bradley. ''It's now pushing 10 percent, and growing very quickly,'' Mr. Libert said. ''We don't know where it might cap out at.''</p>
        <p>But Bradley intends to push it along, with a major marketing drive in Fairfield County on billboards, in newspapers, on radio and cable television.</p>
        <p>Joseph McGee, vice president for public policy and programs at the Southwest Area Commerce and Industry Association in Stamford, said Bradley could capture more of the southwestern Connecticut business and leisure travel market.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gioia of the Connecticut Business and Industry Association said that with the airport promotional campaign, and some growth that will likely come from other sources, Bradley might soon outgrow its expanded quarters.</p>
        <p>Both Logan Airport to the north and Kennedy International Airport to the south are getting more crowded, and crowded highways make them difficult to reach during business hours, he said. And Connecticut is seeing significant growth in high-technology companies and exporters, two industries that rely heavily on air travel.</p>
        <p>W E'RE seeing double-digit growth rates in both transportation of individuals and transport of cargo, and that hasn't even taken into account that there may be a lot more overflow from Logan or Kennedy that could be coming down the line, and the growth in industries that are going to put a lot more pressure on our transportation resources,'' Mr. Gioia said. ''I think everyone realizes the expansion that's going on at Bradley right now is only stopgap.''</p>
        <p>But there are some concerns that the management structure at Bradley might limit its development. It is one of only four major airports that is owned by a state government and by statute must be self-sustaining. That means certain limits on its rate of growth and in the kind of risks it might take. The Legislature's Programs Review and Investigations Committee is reviewing the management situation at Bradley to determine whether changes are needed.</p>
        <p>''The department has been very competent and effective over the years at managing Bradley, but their mission has been very limited, which is to do the maintenance and don't spend too much money,'' Mr. Gioia said. ''That doesn't leave them much room to be innovative. I think it's time for them to get some new instructions.</p>
        <p>Daniel J. Carstens, who owns CargoZone-BDL, a Bradley-based cargo operation, and the publisher of Airport News, which covers Bradley, said Baltimore-Washington International Airport in Maryland had a marketing staff of 14 people and an annual budget of $3 million; Bradley has a marketing staff of three, and a budget of less than $500,000, which must also cover five smaller state airports, two ferries and a state port operation.</p>
        <p>''I think they've done a very good job marketing, as evidenced by their growth,'' Mr. Carstens said. But that comparison raises questions about whether Bradley is reaching its full potential, he said.</p>
        <p>''On the other hand, you don't want to overexpand -- can you imagine the outcry if they built twice what they needed, and five years from now people are asking why we built such a big airport if no one is using it?'' Mr. Carstens asked.</p>
