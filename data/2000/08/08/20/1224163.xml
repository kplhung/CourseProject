        <p>AS Tiger Woods strode onto the 13th tee yesterday at Valhalla Golf Club after his first double-bogey in a major tournament since the Masters, his caddie, Steve Williams, simply offered a reminder.</p>
        <p>''The wind,'' he said, ''is coming off the left.''</p>
        <p>That's all. No looking back. No reference to that double-bogey at the 12th hole, which dropped Woods into a temporary tie for the lead in the 82nd Professional Golfers Association Championship before he would take a one-stroke lead over Scott Dunlap and Bob May into today's final round. Just look ahead to the next hole.</p>
        <p>''Stevie is always positive,'' Woods would say later.</p>
        <p>In Woods's quest to add a second consecutive P.G.A. title to his United States Open and British Open championships, the 36-year-old Williams is always out there with him.</p>
        <p>When Williams is not lugging that big red-white-and-black golf bag around on his sturdy shoulders, he is conferring with Woods, 24, on the distance to the flagstick and on which club to hit, or he is helping to read the line of a putt.</p>
        <p>But Williams is the caddie who only Tiger Woods knows. He doesn't give interviews or sign autographs. In many ways, he is virtually invisible. But not unappreciated.</p>
        <p>''Stevie has been a big part of my success,'' said Woods, who was the leader in the P.G.A. by one stroke, at 13 under par, after shooting a 70 in yesterday's third round. ''He's there not only to motivate me when things are going bad, but he has the gall to tell me what he thinks when I'm feeling uneasy about a club. He's not afraid to get in my face about it, and that is nice.</p>
        <p>''He's got a lot of confidence in his ability as a caddie, and that is very reassuring as a player.''</p>
        <p>Woods remembered getting ready to hit his second shot on the 15th hole at Pebble Beach in the United States Open in June when Williams noticed a man in the gallery pulling a disposable camera out of his pocket. Nothing disrupts a golfer more than an unexpected click of a camera, especially during a swing.</p>
        <p>''Stevie called me off the shot,'' Woods said. ''He said: 'Tiger, get off the shot. There's a guy with a camera.' He went after the guy with the camera. Not too many caddies would actually do that in the U.S. Open and to say 'get off the shot' when I'm over the ball, that takes a lot of guts, but he did it. Then I put it up there on the green, made par and walked on.''</p>
        <p>During the British Open at the Old Course at St. Andrews, Scotland, last month, Woods mentioned how he and Williams had formed a strong friendship.</p>
        <p>''He's gotten to know me really well, how I like to play, what my thought process is,'' Woods said. ''He can read me, to the point where he knows when to say something, when not to say something. And we genuinely like being around each other. I think that makes for a wonderful partnership, especially one that lasts a long time.''</p>
        <p>Every so often here at Valhalla Golf Club, Woods and Williams have shared a laugh or a smile, as they do at every tournament.</p>
        <p>''Stevie's so positive out there, he keeps me upbeat; I get on him, he gets on me,'' Woods said. ''We have a good time out there. If I'm playing good or bad, it doesn't matter, we're going to enjoy each other's company.''</p>
        <p>Woods also likes the way Williams will remind him that there may be another way to play a particular shot.</p>
        <p>''On a couple of tee shots at St. Andrews,'' Woods said, ''he got in my head a little bit and said: 'Look at this option. Consider this.' I think that's what he's so good at. And he doesn't force it on you. If I want to go with my thinking, I go with it. I'm holding the club. But he has the guts to tell me what he's thinking.''</p>
        <p>Many tour caddies play golf at every opportunity, but Williams does not. He occasionally drives racing cars in his native New Zealand.</p>
        <p>''I race cars, mate; golf's not my game,'' he has said. ''I've probably played only about 10 18-hole rounds of golf in the last year.''</p>
        <p>Williams doesn't talk to the news media about his life as Woods's caddie, a life that reportedly earned him at least $600,000 last year and might earn him even more this year.</p>
        <p>But many of those in Woods's inner circle, like his girlfriend, Joanna Jagoda, don't give interviews. ''It's their life and their choice,'' Woods said. ''If they want to do interviews, fine, but it's up to them. I can say, 'I don't think it's good for you to do that because if you do it once, you're going to have to do it twice, then a third time, a fourth time, then so forth and so on.' ''</p>
        <p>Williams, who had caddied for Raymond Floyd and Greg Norman, has been on Woods's bag since early last year after Woods lost confidence in Fluff Cowan, his first tour caddie. Woods's swing guru, Butch Harmon, had asked Floyd's permission to hire Williams.</p>
        <p>''I've known Steve a long time,'' said Harmon, who was once Norman's guru. ''The mix with Tiger is perfect. I didn't think he'd get caught up in the hoopla that surrounds Tiger, and he hasn't. He's good under pressure.</p>
        <p>''If he feels the wind change, he'll stop and tell Tiger. He knows when to say the right thing and when not to say anything. He knows when to be aggressive and when not to be.''</p>
        <p>Williams had caddied 11 years for Floyd, the winner of the 1986 United States Open, the 1976 Masters and two P.G.A. Championships.</p>
        <p>''Steve's very quiet,'' Floyd said. ''He's not looking for publicity. He's a good companion out there. He knows when to pat you on the back, and he knows when to bark at you. He was like another son to me.''</p>
        <p>But now Steve Williams is almost like a big brother to Tiger Woods. He walks with him, laughs with him, listens to him, and knows what to say to him and how to say it.</p>
