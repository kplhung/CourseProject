        <p>Up and down the California coast, thousands of oak trees are dying of a fast-spreading new disease called sudden oak death syndrome. In just five years, it has spread from one to three species of oak and across 350 miles of coastline. Scientists fear it may move outside the state and afflict other species of trees, and the Department of Agriculture says it will discuss its options in fighting the disease next week. It appears to be caused by a species of funguslike organism closely related to the pest that caused Irish potato blight.</p>
