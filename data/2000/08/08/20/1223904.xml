        <p>Ballet Company's 50th Year</p>
        <p>Beth Fritz-Logrea arrived in Ossining by way of Tennessee, Austria and Romania -- a circuitous route of the type common to performing artists. Ms. Fritz-Logrea, a ballet dancer raised in Memphis, broadened her repertory in Europe and met her husband, Jean Logrea, a Romanian dancer, while both were dancing with an opera company in Austria.</p>

        <p>Ballet Company's 50th Year</p>
        <p>Beth Fritz-Logrea arrived in Ossining by way of Tennessee, Austria and Romania -- a circuitous route of the type common to performing artists. Ms. Fritz-Logrea, a ballet dancer raised in Memphis, broadened her repertory in Europe and met her husband, Jean Logrea, a Romanian dancer, while both were dancing with an opera company in Austria.</p>
        <p>When the Westchester Ballet Company in Ossining began to struggle, the couple were recruited to resuscitate it.</p>
        <p>''The company fell on hard times and was going to disband,'' Ms. Fritz-Logrea said of the venture she and her husband undertook in 1988. Instead of going under, however, the group, which was founded in 1950 by Iris Merrick, is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year, with the couple as artistic co-directors.</p>
        <p>''Jean was the first one to say we should do it,'' Ms. Fritz-Logrea said, recalling her own hesitation to take on the project. From the age of 16 through 22 she danced with the Metropolitan Opera ballet company under a scholarship awarded to her by the legendary Dame Alicia Markova. Then came a decade of dancing at home and abroad, followed by the birth of a son in 1985. ''I wasn't ready to stop dancing,'' Ms. Fritz-Logrea said. She didn't stop -- she and her husband danced together in the Westchester Ballet's annual ''Nutcracker'' until she retired from dancing in 1991 to focus on teaching and directing. (Mr. Logrea still performs with the company, as does 14-year-old Nicholas Logrea.)</p>
        <p>The Logrea Dance Academy in Ossining, which the couple runs, has awarded more than $66,000 in scholarships to 220 dancers since 1988. This year's scholarship auditions will take place on Sept. 9, while auditions for the company, which will give five performances of ''The Nutcracker'' at the Westchester County Center in December, will take place on Sept. 17, both at the school. The number to call for information about obtaining tickets is (914) 941-4532.</p>
        <p>A Fledgling Spreads Its Wings</p>
        <p>Dance is sprouting wings in lower Westchester, too. Another couple, Diana White, formerly a soloist with the New York City Ballet, and her husband, Christian Claessens, a former member of the Dutch National Ballet, have started a company with Valentina Kozlova, formerly of the Boshoi Ballet and the New York City Ballet. Auditions for a concert on Nov. 11 and 12 will take place Sept. 5 through 9 from 10 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. at the their Scarsdale Ballet Studio. The company -- as yet unnamed -- made its debut last spring.</p>
        <p>Auditions can be arranged by calling (914) 725-8754.</p>
        <p>A Thumbs-Up for the Neuberger</p>
        <p>How do museum directors spend their days? Pondering great works of art is half the answer. But if you're aiming at accreditation -- something only a small fraction of museums do -- you also inspect boiler rooms, check for dust in print rooms and generally poke your nose all over the place. When Dr. Lucinda Gedeon and the staff of the Neuberger Museum of Art in Purchase came up for air recently after a yearlong internal review, they received a thumbs-up from a committee of their peers at the American Association of Museums. Of the 8,000 museums in the country, only 750 are accredited. The Neuberger is now an accredited member of the group, although the only change will be a new logo on the museum's letterhead.</p>
        <p>''It's an award and an honor and a distinction,'' Dr. Gedeon said of the accreditation. ''You sometimes get a year to fix something up, but we flew right through.''</p>
        <p>Benefits on 'Dark' Mondays</p>
        <p>Sometimes it takes a name to get a project rolling. ''Mondays in the Dark With George'' is such a case, with no apologies so far to Stephen Sondheim. The George in question is George Puello, artistic director and associate producer of Westchester Broadway Theater in Elmsford, who has found a way to brighten the theater on traditionally ''dark'' Monday nights. ''It's my pet project, my passion,'' he said of his decision to hold fund-raisers at the theater once a month. ''The artists donate their time -- they're also off on Mondays,'' he said. ''We have light and sound, and it's a lot cheaper than if we rented space somewhere else. The theater donates a lot but not all.''</p>
        <p>On Sept. 18, Robert Evan, who starred in the original Broadway cast of ''Jekyll &amp; Hyde,'' will perform on behalf of the Lord's Pantry in White Plains and the Agape Fund in Valhalla, groups devoted to people living with AIDS. On Oct. 16, Joel Martin, a pianist from White Plains, will perform in a benefit for Bran Pace, an actor with a spinal cord injury.</p>
        <p>Why is Mr. Puello doing this? ''Five years ago, I lost my life partner to AIDS,'' he said, ''and we raised money for the Lord's Pantry in his honor.'' There were other tragedies in his backyard, until ''I realized there are so many not-for-profit organizations we could do things for,'' he said.</p>
