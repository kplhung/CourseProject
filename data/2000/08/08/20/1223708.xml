        <p>AN INVISIBLE SIGN OF MY OWN</p>
        <p>By Aimee Bender.</p>
        <p>242 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Doubleday. $22.95.</p>
        <p>IN her first novel, as in ''The Girl in the Flammable Skirt'' (1998), her debut collection of stories, Aimee Bender seems at home in a world of oddities. In ''An Invisible Sign of My Own,'' the characters are known by their anomalies -- the chemical burns on a science teacher's arms or the numbers worn by the owner of a hardware store to signify his mood. The isolated, quirky quality of the landscape -- the only multistoried building in town is a hospital made entirely of blue glass -- brings to mind experimental communities built under plastic domes.</p>
        <p>A subtle sense of equilibrium is required to prevent this world from being little else than odd, and to allow the emergence of universal truths that stand in welcome relief. Luckily, Bender has such a sense: she employs the most exacting of logics, mathematics, to add a thematic cohesiveness to her novel, and one of the most universal of human emotions, the fear of losing someone you love, to give the book emotional weight.</p>
        <p>Fittingly, the novel opens with a fairy tale: in a kingdom where the inhabitants live forever, the king asks for a volunteer from each family to die to ease overcrowding. One family, unable to choose, decides to offer a part of each person, thereby making up one body. But the townspeople can never grow accustomed to their newly hobbled neighbors, and the family is forced to move away. The novel's narrator, Mona Gray, hears the story from her father on her 10th birthday. This year also marks the onset of her father's mysterious illness; he appears suddenly ''with death perched on his shoulder as high and pleased as an organ grinder's monkey.'' Like the family of the kingdom, Mona responds to her father's slow death with a sacrifice of her own: she quits everything that brings her pleasure -- running, dessert, sex. The only thing she won't, or can't, quit is math.</p>
        <p>Math, along with an obsessive habit of knocking on wood, provides Mona with a shaky hold on her sanity in the face of her father's decline. Bender writes: ''Mix up some numbers and signs, and you get an equation for the way the wind shifts or an axiom for the movement of water. . . . You can account for softness. You can explain everything.'' But when Mona begins teaching math at the local elementary school and develops a romantic relationship with Benjamin Smith, a science teacher, and a kinship with Lisa Venus, a second grader whose mother is dying of cancer, even her private safeguards are no match for the messiness of love and connection.</p>
        <p>In fits and false starts, Benjamin and Lisa persuade Mona to give up the acts of self-denial. Much of the novel's pleasure is found in the scenes in which Mona recalls the things that make a person feel alive. Here she's in bed with Benjamin: ''His hands are on my face and we're wrapped around each other then and it's slow and silent and intent, nothing fancy, nothing new; if people were watching in the movie theater they'd file out to the box office, demanding their money back, bored. What's going on with those two, they'd say, they are just taking their own sweet time, aren't they.''</p>
        <p>Bender's affection for numbers -- I can imagine her doodling equations in the margins of her manuscript -- suffuses ''An Invisible Sign of My Own'' with the authority of a novelist who has found her turf. Less convincing is the feeling between Mona and her father that led her to alter her life so dramatically. Their connection never becomes more specific than the general axiom that parents and kids must love each other. More palpable is Mona's grief over her father's condition, although it is delivered mostly secondhand, through her identification with Lisa and her sick mother.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, ''An Invisible Sign of My Own'' has much to recommend it. The integrity of the skewed universe Bender evokes reveals a lively, disciplined mind. The freshness and lucidity of her prose suggest a novelist who knows her own voice. Now Bender needs to follow Mona's example and trade in some of the neatness of her mathematical conceit for more of the muck and mire of emotion.</p>
