        <p>A proposal by a Swiss and Swedish company to give the Bronx its first electrical generating plant is dividing community leaders in the South Bronx. Some fear it may create more pollution without providing benefits for residents, while others, noting that the city's electrical capacity is stretched and that Con Edison's rates are rising, favor a new plant.</p>
        <p>The plant, if approved, would be built at the Oak Point Yards at a cost of about $950 million. It would generate 1,075 megawatts of electricity a day, making it the biggest plant among the dozen or so new ones proposed for the city, company officials said.</p>

        <p>A proposal by a Swiss and Swedish company to give the Bronx its first electrical generating plant is dividing community leaders in the South Bronx. Some fear it may create more pollution without providing benefits for residents, while others, noting that the city's electrical capacity is stretched and that Con Edison's rates are rising, favor a new plant.</p>
        <p>The plant, if approved, would be built at the Oak Point Yards at a cost of about $950 million. It would generate 1,075 megawatts of electricity a day, making it the biggest plant among the dozen or so new ones proposed for the city, company officials said.</p>
        <p>Steve Smith, vice president of North American operations for ABB Energy Ventures, the company making the proposal, said the plant would sell its energy to a wholesale distributor in the city, who would then sell it to energy providers, like Con Edison. Completion of the project is scheduled for early 2004.</p>
        <p>Selling the energy to a wholesaler would not guarantee that it would be distributed in the Bronx. But, Mr. Smith said, the creation of distribution systems for that energy in the borough would drive down costs there for all electricity, wherever generated. Distribution systems would be built along with the plant, he explained.</p>
        <p>ABB, whose American headquarters are in Norwalk, Conn., has a three-year exclusive purchase option on the Oak Point yards, which is owned by Bright Start Homes, a real estate company.</p>
        <p>A preliminary assessment of the project is being examined by the state Department of Environmental Conservation. A public review process is expected to begin early next month, company officials said.</p>
        <p>Some community leaders, however, are wary of another large plant in a neighborhood that already has numerous industries.</p>
        <p>''Our jury is still open on this,'' said Paul Lipson, executive director of the Point, a community group. ''It's really not clear that the electricity will be sold in the Bronx, so we may not benefit from lower rates. And we're still concerned what it would do on an environmental front.''</p>
        <p>The size of other benefits, such as new jobs, are also an issue, he said, adding, ''We're coming at this with a skeptical eye.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith said the plant would create about 40 full-time jobs, all of which would be filled from the Bronx.</p>
        <p>But some local leaders like the idea of a new plant. ''The Bronx gets all of its electricity from Queens and Westchester,'' said John Roberts, district manager of Community Board 2. ''If this plant were to lower electricity rates in the Bronx, like ABB says it will, then that would be a good thing.''</p>
