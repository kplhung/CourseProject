        <p>In New York City, where two-thirds of the registered voters are Democrats, vigorous primaries between Republicans are few and far between. But there is such a contest being waged between two Republicans who are seeking a State Senate seat in a district that includes parts of Brooklyn and Staten Island.</p>
        <p>The race, in the 23rd Senate District, features former State Senator Robert J. DiCarlo, who held the seat for four years until his defeat in 1996. He is facing Charles Capetanakis, a lawyer who recently stepped down as president of the local school board to run. The winner of the primary will face the incumbent, Vincent Gentile, a Democrat, in the general election in November.</p>

        <p>In New York City, where two-thirds of the registered voters are Democrats, vigorous primaries between Republicans are few and far between. But there is such a contest being waged between two Republicans who are seeking a State Senate seat in a district that includes parts of Brooklyn and Staten Island.</p>
        <p>The race, in the 23rd Senate District, features former State Senator Robert J. DiCarlo, who held the seat for four years until his defeat in 1996. He is facing Charles Capetanakis, a lawyer who recently stepped down as president of the local school board to run. The winner of the primary will face the incumbent, Vincent Gentile, a Democrat, in the general election in November.</p>
        <p>In the district, which is anchored in the Bay Ridge and Dyker Heights sections of Brooklyn, the race is notable because it will determine whether Mr. DiCarlo returns to the seat that once placed him in the center of Republican politics in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>The son of an assemblyman, Mr. DiCarlo was the lone Republican elected official from the borough and served as the party's chairman in Brooklyn. But deep-set fissures within the party led other Republican leaders to oppose him in 1996, and he lost both the party's primary and the general election, in which he ran on the Conservative line.</p>
        <p>In discussing his candidacy with voters, Mr. DiCarlo, 43, says that his four years in the Senate have afforded him the experience to be far more effective than Mr. Capetanakis, whom he portrays as a political novice.</p>
        <p>''I think most people in this district realize that I was a good senator,'' Mr. DiCarlo said. ''I passed 62 laws when I was there. I was the chairman of the aging committee and passed a lot of legislation to help seniors. I produced record amounts of money for the people of this district.''</p>
        <p>Furthermore, Mr. DiCarlo says, he would be a stronger candidate in the general election against Senator Gentile. ''I don't think there is any political person around who would argue that Charlie Capetanakis has a better chance of beating Gentile than I do,'' he said. ''I have a record to compare with Gentile's and Charlie doesn't.''</p>
        <p>But despite the years since his incumbency, Mr. DiCarlo remains a controversial figure in Brooklyn politics. And many officials say that he has established a reputation for frequent battles with others in the Republican Party. Several years ago, the leaders of the party accused him of a string of misdeeds, including the mishandling of party money when he was county leader. Mr. DiCarlo denies the accusations.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Capetanakis, 38, this is his first campaign for elective office other than races for school board positions. And he takes great pains to praise his history as a nonpolitician. ''I'm a lawyer and a certified public accountant,'' he said. ''The major difference between me and Robert DiCarlo is the fact that I don't need this job. I want this job. I want to serve the public.''</p>
        <p>About his opponent, Mr. Capetanakis said: ''He wants to serve himself. DiCarlo has always had a state job and has always lived off the fat of the state.''</p>
        <p>He said that his priorities in the Senate would be legislation to reduce the state's taxes and to create a charter school district within the neighborhoods he would represent.</p>
        <p>The district also includes the Stapleton and Midland Beach sections of Staten Island, which is connected to the Brooklyn side of the district by the Verrazano Bridge. It has a large population of Italian-Americans, with non-Hispanic, white residents making up about 75 percent of the district and Hispanic residents making up 10 percent.</p>
        <p>While Democrats have a slight edge among the district's registered voters, it is an area where Republican candidates have done well. Both the Brooklyn and Staten Island parts are represented by Republican city councilmen and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani won overwhelmingly in the area.</p>
        <p>Despite the rarity of Republican primaries in New York City, they are not unusual in the 23rd Senate District. Mr. Gentile won the seat for the Democrats after a fractious primary between Mr. DiCarlo and the eventual Republican nominee, John M. Gangemi. And two years ago, Mr. Gangemi lost an attempt to become the Republican nominee to Christopher J. Mega, who preceded Mr. DiCarlo in the Senate and stepped down as the presiding judge of New York State's Court of Claims to run. He also lost to Senator Gentile.</p>
        <p>Republican officials and strategists say it is difficult to tell which party has the advantage.</p>
        <p>Mr. Capetanakis has been endorsed by many of the Republican Party officials on Staten Island and by City Councilman Martin Golden, who represents Brooklyn. Mr. Capetanakis is also outspending Mr. DiCarlo, having raised about $150,000, twice the amount raised by the DiCarlo campaign. Mr. DiCarlo has been endorsed by some of Brooklyn's Republican district leaders, three Republican clubs and Arnaldo A. Ferraro, a former assemblyman who was once a DiCarlo detractor.</p>
        <p>Watching all of this on the sidelines is Mr. Gentile, the incumbent, who predicted that he would likely be the beneficiary of a bruising battle between Republicans. ''It can't hurt,'' he said of the Republican primary. ''But it won't change my strategy. I still have to gear up for November.''</p>
