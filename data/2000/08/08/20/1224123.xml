        <p>The main event may have been in the big arena, but for Representative Joseph M. Hoeffel of Pennsylvania and dozens of other Democratic candidates from around the country, the action was all in a small cluster of television studios to the side.</p>
        <p>Virtually around the clock on each of the four days of the Democratic National Convention, Mr. Hoeffel and his colleagues filed into the headquarters of the party-run Democratic News Service to submit to interviews with television and radio stations back home.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hoeffel, locked in a tight re-election fight in his suburban Philadelphia district, had been through the doors several times to participate in Internet chat rooms, talk with Pennsylvania radio personalities and appear by satellite on as many television stations as he could, from Channel 6 in Philadelphia to Channel 69 in Allentown.</p>
        <p>''It's great outreach,'' he said, as the bustling news service became so filled with political faces it began to resemble the Senate cloakroom. ''The media like being able to do a live feed.''</p>
        <p>The candidates do not mind, either, no matter what the hour.</p>
        <p>Unlike the Republicans, who used their four days of media exposure in Philadelphia as an unabashed promotional vehicle with a single focus, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Democrats chose to fragment their television moment into a thousand points of spotlight.</p>
        <p>The party gave dozens of lower-tier candidates across the country easy access to the production facilities of the Democrats' news service -- whose staff of 400 employees and volunteers made it one of the largest news-gathering outfits at the convention -- as well as coveted speaking slots on the convention stage.</p>
        <p>What this meant for broadcasters at home was not only a local face to put on the air, but also more of a reason for doing so.</p>
        <p>''People were saying, 'What an incoherent convention,' but they misunderstand that half this convention was designed for local news consumption,'' said Dr. Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p>The idea Vice President Al Gore's campaign latched onto, she said, was to keep local officials and candidates happy by giving them the exposure they craved, and perhaps even creating a reverse coattail effect in the process. ''You take care of everyone who's running, because you want everyone who votes for that person to not split their ticket,'' Dr. Jamieson said.</p>
        <p>As a result, local broadcasters found themselves being catered to by the national party as if every rural set of call letters produced a ''Today'' show.</p>
        <p>Arthur Steadman, news director of WEVV in Evansville, Ind., and Owensboro, Ky. -- the 98th-largest media market in the nation -- did not send a single staff member to the convention. But he had to do little more than snap his fingers to book the Democratic governor of Kentucky, Paul E. Patton, on the air with his 6 and 10 p.m. anchor, Kelly Sutton.</p>
        <p>''They called us and offered us the lieutenant governor, and I said no,'' Mr. Steadman said. ''And then they wanted to give us the state party chair, who happens to be the governor's daughter. I said, 'If you're going to go through all that trouble, how about giving us the governor?' ''</p>
        <p>A governor sought, a governor delivered. ''When people start talking about issues, they're going to love this Gore-Lieberman team'' is the message Mr. Patton gave Ms. Sutton across the microwaves in the news service's Studio 2 on Thursday afternoon. ''We represent working-class Kentuckians, and that's going to come across very strongly in the next 10 weeks.''</p>
        <p>National party officials, convinced that the election will be decided in swing states like Kentucky -- which has voted for the winner in every presidential race since 1960 -- are hoping that what came across last week was an impression of Mr. Gore as his own man, and as the more able manager of the budget surplus.</p>
        <p>It was through outlets like WEVV, the party believed, that its message could be conveyed most cleanly. Local stations devote only a few minutes each day to politics, and most of the time only the most easy-to-digest themes of the campaign filter through.</p>
        <p>''Our media strategy is based on local television,'' said Joe Andrew, chairman of the Democratic National Committee. ''Four out of five people get the news about the convention from their local paper, local television, local radio.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, the Republicans concentrated almost obsessively on Mr. Bush. On the nights he could not be in the First Union Center, his image was beamed onto three jumbo screens that dominated the podium, and the ''talking points'' memorandums given to the delegates summarizing his proposals were nine pages long. Mr. Gore, in contrast, was barely a presence at the Staples Center until the convention's third night, when he walked onstage to give his daughter a hug, and the talking points left on delegates' seats were a mere page.</p>
        <p>If the Democrats were indeed relying more heavily than the Republicans did on local news organizations to tell their story, it may have been a trickier task to pull off.</p>
        <p>An examination of newspaper, radio and television coverage last week in seven cities -- Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Denver, Houston, Memphis and Miami -- indicated that while news organizations often delved into the basic points the Democrats wanted emphasized, the convention was treated more like a civics lesson than as must-see TV.</p>
        <p>On television, the convention was rarely the lead story: in Memphis, which is in Mr. Gore's home state, and in Houston, which is in Mr. Bush's, the weather, in the form of heat and hurricanes, tended to get better play. Even on the night of Mr. Gore's speech, WCVB in Boston led its 11 p.m. newscast with a report about the impending murder trial of Michael Skakel, nephew of Ethel Kennedy.</p>
        <p>Nationally, in fact, while the ratings were slightly higher than they had been for the Republican convention -- a trend that has remained consistent for the last five presidential election cycles -- the average number of homes reached each night, 15.3 million, was the lowest for the Democratic Party since 1972, according to Nielsen Media Research.</p>
        <p>In Atlanta, for instance, the top-rated radio station, WSB, carried only one live speech, Mr. Gore's. ''We did not play up this convention,'' said Chris Camp, the station's news director. ''Basically it comes down to the fact that conventions are more scripted. There was no suspense, no mystery; everybody knew who the nominee was going to be.''</p>
        <p>Even for Tennessee reporters, attendance was apparently not mandatory. Only one of the four stations in Memphis, the Fox affiliate, assigned a reporter to Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>''We considered briefly whether we should send somebody to cover the convention and spend $30,000 to $40,000 on a story that maybe about 15 to 20 percent of our viewers truly appreciated,'' said Peggy Phillip, news director of WMC, the NBC affiliate there. ''The story that everybody is talking about this week is 118 Russians under the sea.''</p>
        <p>Still, some of the stations that did spend the money provided the requisite breathless reports.</p>
        <p>''Everyone here is extremely jazzed,'' Phil Keating, a reporter for WSVN, the Fox affiliate in Denver, observed from the Staples Center after Mr. Gore spoke. ''He set himself apart, he didn't seem stiff and he came across as a well-connecting speaker tonight.''</p>
        <p>It would be hard, however, to match the enthusiasm for the ticket felt by a candidate like Representative Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, who is in a close race with the incumbent, Spencer Abraham, for a United States Senate seat. She spent so much time at the Democratic News Service last week that she could have had a control room named for her.</p>
        <p>''If you look at the press we got back in Michigan, it's absolutely fabulous,'' said Robert Gibbs, Ms. Stabenow's communications director. ''We could move our message directly from L.A. using their satellites, right into the homes of millions of Michigan voters.''</p>
