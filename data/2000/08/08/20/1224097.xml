        <p>Stun guns and electronic anklets may add a high-tech sheen to corrections work, but its underlying pursuit is an age-old struggle, Thomas McCarthy says.</p>
        <p>''It's the forces of the wall versus the anti-wall,'' Mr. McCarthy said, referring to those bent on incarceration and those intent on rehabilitation. ''This struggle has been the history of corrections since the beginning.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McCarthy has a good perspective on the topic. As an officer with the city's Department of Correction, he has seen the system from the inside. He is also a part-time historian of corrections and, more recently, a founder of the first official historical society in the state devoted to prisons.</p>
        <p>With the help of colleagues and scholars from both sides of the debate, he started the group, the New York Correction History Society, last year to document the 375 years of prisons in the city and state. (The first prison, he said, was built in Fort Amsterdam in 1625, at the southern tip of Manhattan.)</p>
        <p>The society also has a Web site to promote the study of prisons, to foster communication among prison buffs and even to plumb deep questions.</p>
        <p>''From a sociological standpoint, the history of corrections tells you a lot about the nature of society,'' said Mr. McCarthy, who was recently appointed the first director of historical services for the city's Correction Department. ''It's a reflection of how society views the deserving versus the undeserving.''</p>
        <p>WHAT YOU SEE -- Four keys link visitors to the site's major areas. One examines historical milestones and includes, for example, a biography of Katherine Bement Davis, who in 1914 became the first woman to head the city's Correction Department. Other areas cover prison history from 1625 to 1896, offer virtual tours of the museum of the State Corrections Department and the like, and explains the society's activities.</p>
        <p>The site also provides an overview of the city's prison system and a time line of prison officers killed in the line of duty. There is also a collection of articles about Hart Island, a former penal colony at the western edge of Long Island Sound that serves as the city's potter's field. (One of the island's old jails is shown above.)</p>
        <p>LINKS -- To a bountiful collection of prison-related sites, including ones run by government agencies (the city's Department of Correction), advocacy groups (the Fortune Society) and educational institutions (the John Jay College of Criminal Justice). There are also links to the American Local History Network, an aggregate of independent sites devoted to regional history.</p>
        <p>WHAT YOU GET -- A historical look at New York's corrections system from behind the prison wall.</p>
