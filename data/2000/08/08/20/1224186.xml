        <p>Somalis inaugurated their first national assembly since the nation's central government fell in 1991. The next step will be selecting executive positions, which will be divided along clan lines, much like the assembly seats. More crucial will be the transfer of  government back to Somalia from the neighboring country of Djibouti, where peace talks have been taking place since March.</p>
