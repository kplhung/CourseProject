        <p>Leon Vannais and Lee Vannais, Belgrade Lakes, Me., July 1, 2000</p>
        <p>Leon Vannais (seated): ''We've been going to Belgrade Lakes for 30 years. Our kids grew up there. Lee, my grandson, grew up there. It's a family thing. That day, we were getting ready for our annual lobster feast. It's a tradition, and once it's been established you've got to have it. You put your feet in the water and scrub the clams. We fire up the wood-burning stove, put a kettle on, steam them. We cook the lobsters. We put newspaper down on the tables and then dive in. That's what makes for a family -- sitting at a table and talking for two and a half hours. I didn't make a lot of money in my life and my wife didn't either, but at least we can leave the kids some land. And the way they look at things and accept things.''</p>

        <p>Lee Vannais (standing): ''I'm in the environmental sciences. Both my sisters are, too. It all really started there at my grandparents' cabin. It affected us all more than we ever expected. The place hasn't changed since I was a kid. No TV. God forbid, cable. I had to fight with them to get new stairs when they were falling apart. They don't want to lose any memories, and they have a picture in their mind's eye of particular stairs, of watching the campfire from them. Time stands still there. But not still enough. Every year, I say I should really spend more time with my grandparents. We are all a little worried about the future and bad health. The thing they're going to leave is memories of being together.''</p>
