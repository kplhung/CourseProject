        <p>HERE is a concept for a reality TV show that is sure to knock 'em dead: ''Who Wants to Be a Failure?''</p>
        <p>It would work like this: Put a dozen young entrepreneurs on a perilous island -- say, Manhattan -- and equip them only with millions of dollars in venture capital. Set up Webcams to watch their offices around the clock and tell them to start dot-com companies. Over two years, America gets to witness their trials and tribulations: the caffeine-fueled all-night brainstorming sessions, the aching trauma of wooing investors, the bare-knuckled struggle to make sure each employee gets his own nap area.</p>

        <p>HERE is a concept for a reality TV show that is sure to knock 'em dead: ''Who Wants to Be a Failure?''</p>
        <p>It would work like this: Put a dozen young entrepreneurs on a perilous island -- say, Manhattan -- and equip them only with millions of dollars in venture capital. Set up Webcams to watch their offices around the clock and tell them to start dot-com companies. Over two years, America gets to witness their trials and tribulations: the caffeine-fueled all-night brainstorming sessions, the aching trauma of wooing investors, the bare-knuckled struggle to make sure each employee gets his own nap area.</p>
        <p>The contestant who tanks his company first wins, yes, $1 million, plus a zippy new motorized scooter and a copy of the play-at-home game.</p>
        <p>Yes, failure has come to mean triumph. These days, it seems, the way to prove that you're a real pioneer is to sink somebody else's $125 million into a half-baked online venture, attract huge attention and only then discover that, oops, you're in a little over your head. Cratering is a sign that you're in the core of the culture, that you're clicking on the brass mouse.</p>
        <p>It was not always so, of course. Failure used to connote repo men and leaving town in the dead of night to escape the disapproving stares of neighbors. Today, it's a rite of passage.</p>
        <p>''Failure is the price of being on the bleeding edge, on the forefront of something you take pride in,'' said Gretchen Rubin, author of ''Power, Money, Fame, Sex'' (Pocket Books). ''In the past, you would have never wanted to be branded a failure, but now it shows you're creative, a risk taker. Entrepreneurship is the greatest virtue these days -- it's what everybody praises.''</p>
        <p>Naturally, it is much easier to rebound from failure in these boom times than it would be during a recession. Jobtrak.com, which monitors job postings at colleges, reported that the number of openings for new college graduates rose by 40.8 percent this year. So who cares if your job evaporates? Another is always just around the corner.</p>
        <p>Failure chic has spawned a cottage industry of failurenalia. Academics are writing books about failing. The VH-1 and E! Entertainment cable channels have shown programs about it. An Internet marketing firm called Thehiredguns.com sponsors pink-slip parties where casualties can get together and ''dot-commiserate.''</p>
        <p>How better to capitalize on the trend than with a Web site? A flock of pages have appeared, from  failuremag.com and dotcomfailures.com (motto: ''Kick 'em when they're down!'') to a few with unprintable names.</p>
        <p>''Our purpose is to take the stigma away from failing,'' said Nicholas Hall, 30, the chief executive of Startupfailures.com, a three-month-old online community for people in the throes of dot-com angst.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hall ought to know. He ran no fewer than three companies into the ground before starting his latest site. Rather than sit around lamenting,  he published an inspirational book for peers in need of a pick-me-up and hit the lecture circuit to  share his insights on going bust. ''What people call failure,'' he said, ''I choose to call an experiment.''</p>
        <p>Justin Sewell, chief executive of Despair Inc., which runs despair.com and sells ''demotivational'' products like ''Failure!'' T-shirts, says young people, especially, are no longer ashamed of failing. ''It has been properly recognized as a natural and understandable consequence of taking risks -- in business, in research, in relationships,'' he said. ''The biggest risks most often end in the biggest failures. But I think our culture admires a risk taker who fails more than a coward who never succeeds.''</p>
        <p>Or better still, a risk taker who fails and then succeeds -- like Mr. Sewell, who followed a ''frustrating and demoralizing'' experience at an Internet service provider by starting his current venture, which he said will gross $1 million in online sales this year.</p>
        <p>HERE, then, are some failure do's and don'ts. First, be sure to fail big. ''It makes you more important in the world,'' Ms. Rubin said.</p>
        <p>But do not remain a failure for long. You must work and rework your magic to show the world that your last setback was simply the fault of bad timing, bad forecasts or bad luck, not any flaw in you.</p>
        <p>Above all else, never, ever disappear. Invisibility is a fate worse than failure -- which is precisely what I won't do once my TV show does. After the Letterman appearances dwindle and the magazines stop hailing me as a visionary, I'll pen a motivational book full of my insights and experiences. I'll call it ''You'll Never Eat Lunch Online Again.'' I'm sure it will sell in the millions.</p>
