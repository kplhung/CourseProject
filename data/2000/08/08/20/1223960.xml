        <p>IN the summer there are certain pasta dishes I like to serve over and over again and I don't tire of them. One is spaghetti tossed in a sauce made with lemon juice, olive oil and Parmesan, mixed so that it forms an emulsion. But it has no cream, and at the end, lemon peel and basil are stirred in. It's rich but not heavy, and friends constantly ask me for the recipe, which is based on one I came across in ''The River Cafe Cookbook'' by Ruth Rogers and Rose Gray (Random House).</p>
        <p>Another of my favorite sauces is made from plum tomatoes roasted in the oven, which concentrates their flavor and gives them a smokey taste. Plum tomatoes have less juice than other varieties, and a high flesh content, which makes the sauce is thick, not watery. (Roasted plum tomatoes also make a good soup, when put through a food mill and served chilled, with mint, basil or chives).</p>

It's rich but not heavy, and friends constantly ask me for the recipe, which is based on one I came across in ''The River Cafe Cookbook'' by Ruth Rogers and Rose Gray (Random House).</p>
        <p>Another of my favorite sauces is made from plum tomatoes roasted in the oven, which concentrates their flavor and gives them a smokey taste. Plum tomatoes have less juice than other varieties, and a high flesh content, which makes the sauce is thick, not watery. (Roasted plum tomatoes also make a good soup, when put through a food mill and served chilled, with mint, basil or chives).</p>
        <p>Asparagus, fava beans or haricots verts with pesto are another great combination on pasta in the summer. Jeremy Gresham, the chef at Guastavino's, Terence Conran's new restaurant under the 59th Street Bridge in Manhattan, makes use of just about every herb in the garden for his pesto sauce, which he serves on fusilli with asparagus, fava beans and olives, topping each serving with a dollop of ricotta or mascarpone cheese and toasted almonds.</p>
        <p>The following dishes are great for lunch, or as a first course before grilled meat or fish.</p>
        <p>Spaghetti al Limone  Total time: 30 minutes</p>
        <p>1 pound spaghetti  Juice of 3 to 4 lemons  1 cup extra-virgin olive oil  1 cup freshly grated Parmesan  1 teaspoon grated lemon peel  Coarse sea salt and freshly ground pepper to taste  1 cup basil leaves, snipped.</p>
        <p>1. Bring eight quarts salted water to boil and cook the spaghetti.</p>
        <p>2. Meanwhile, combine the lemon juice and the olive oil in a small bowl. Stir in the Parmesan and lemon peel. Mix until sauce is thick and creamy. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>3. Drain the spaghetti and empty it into a warm serving bowl. Add sauce and toss pasta so that the strands are thoroughly coated. Stir in the basil, correct seasoning and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 to 6 servings.</p>
        <p>Plum Tomato Sauce With Penne  Total time: 1 hour</p>
        <p>4 pounds plum tomatoes</p>
        <p>1/2 cup olive oil  1 head garlic  1 cup basil leaves, snipped  Coarse sea salt and freshly ground pepper to taste  1 pound penne  Freshly grated Parmesan.</p>
        <p>1. Prepare the sauce for the pasta. (This is something that can be done in advance.) Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Put the tomatoes, whole and unpeeled, in two oiled baking pans large enough to hold them in one layer.</p>
        <p>2. Separate the head of garlic into cloves and put them around the tomatoes. Sprinkle them with a little of the olive oil and roast in the oven for about 45 minutes, or until the tomatoes are charred and the garlic is soft.</p>
        <p>3. Peel the garlic cloves and mash them with the remaining oil into a puree. Peel the tomatoes and put them in a bowl. Mash the garlic into the tomatoes so you have a thick puree. Then add the basil and season to taste with salt and pepper. You should have about five cups of the sauce.</p>
        <p>4. Meanwhile, cook the penne in boiling salted water. Put in a heated bowl and coat with three cups sauce (the remainder can be frozen). Toss and serve, passing the cheese separately.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 to 6 servings.</p>
        <p>Fusilli With Herb Pesto, Asparagus and Fava Beans  Total time: 40 minutes</p>
        <p>For the herb pesto:  1 cup parsley</p>
        <p>1/4 cup cilantro</p>
        <p>1/4 cup tarragon</p>
        <p>1/4 cup basil  2 tablespoon thyme  1 tablespoon rosemary  6 cloves garlic, peeled and sliced (green part removed)</p>
        <p>3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil  Sea salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</p>
        <p>For the pasta:  1 pound fusilli  8 asparagus spears, blanched and cut on the bias  2 cups cooked fava beans</p>
        <p>1/4 cup unsalted butter, cut into small pieces</p>
        <p>1/2 cup cured black olives, pitted</p>
        <p>1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</p>
        <p>1/2 cup ricotta cheese or mascarpone</p>
        <p>1/4 cup toasted almonds, sliced.</p>
        <p>1. Make the pesto. Blanch the herbs in lightly salted water. Drain and shock them in ice water so they cool fast. Squeeze out the water and chop the herbs coarsely with a sharp knife. Put them in a blender with the garlic, olive oil and salt and pepper to taste and puree.</p>
        <p>2. Boil the pasta in six quarts salted water with a little olive oil added to prevent it from sticking. When it is al dente, add the asparagus and fava beans so they heat through and drain, reserving half a cup of the cooking water in the pot. Return the fusilli to the pot with the asparagus and fava beans. Add the pesto, butter, olives and season to taste with salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>3. Divide the pasta among four dishes. Top with grated Parmesan, a dollop of ricotta or mascarpone and the toasted almonds. Serve at once.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
