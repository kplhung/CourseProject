        <p>ON the Japanese art scene, as in real estate, finance and employment, the baburu (economic bubble) burst long ago. Today, the friends and contacts a Western visitor encounters here are sure to recollect, with incredulity and undisguised embarrassment, the heady days of the 1980's, when Japanese corporations spent tens of millions of dollars on Impressionist paintings at overseas auctions, and when new museums, public and private, seemed to pop up every month.</p>
        <p>At the start of the 90's, Japan's overheated real estate market collapsed, which in turn affected other sectors of the economy. Art sales slumped. Some commercial galleries closed. Companies that had bought artworks primarily as investments but had rarely, or never, displayed them saw their values plummet. (It did not help that many of those works were lesser Marie Laurencins or Maurice Utrillos of the old School of Paris calendar-art variety.)</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, against a backdrop of lingering art-world doldrums, the new, city-financed Taro Okamoto Museum opened late last year in Kawasaki, not far to the southwest of central Tokyo. Housed in a typically monumental new building in a wooded public park, it honors one of Japan's most influential modern artists. And with some 100,000 visitors already, it has quickly become a hit.</p>
        <p>Okamoto, who died just shy of his 85th birthday in 1996, was also a photographer, an ethnographer and a prolific author. In his later years, he became known as an eccentric television personality who turned up in commercials declaring, ''Art is explosion!'' In Japan, he was also one of the few household-names in art of his generation. Okamoto was born in Kawasaki in 1911. His father, Ippei, was a well-known cartoonist for Asahi Shimbun, a leading national newspaper. His mother, Kanoko, was a poet and novelist known for artistic and personal style. Taro was the Okamotos' only child; in 1929, the family traveled to Europe, where Ippei had been sent on an assignment.</p>
        <p>Before they left Japan, Taro had begun studying at the Tokyo School of Fine Arts. He resumed his studies in Paris, where he learned to speak French and came of age as a serious young artist. Okamoto lived there for 12 years, during which he befriended Alberto Giacometti and Jean Arp, took part in the Abstraction-Creation group and later showed his work with the surrealists. In Abstraction-Creation's 1934 almanac, Okamoto held his own in a climate of passionate polemics and manifestoes about art, offering bons mots like: ''We must create form that is not form and color that is not color.''</p>
        <p>In Paris, Okamoto was moved by the folk and tribal arts on view at the Trocadero Museum of Ethnography (which later became the Museum of Man). He absorbed the ideas of the sociologist and anthropologist Marcel Mauss (1872-1950), who examined the role of gift giving and magic in society and propounded a theory of ''totality''; that is, of examining the actions of a total human existence rather than a fragmented one. Okamoto also became associated with Georges Bataille's College of Sociology.</p>
        <p>During Okamoto's long Paris sojourn, his paintings featured abstract, biomorphic forms set against empty backgrounds with a surrealist air. Forced to head back to Japan in 1940 as the war in Europe spread, Okamoto was stationed in China with the Japanese army for five years. Returning home, to the politically charged atmosphere of American-occupied Japan, Okamoto created some of his most memorable images.</p>
        <p>These included the large oil paintings ''Heavy Industry'' (1949) and ''Law of the Jungle'' (1950). Produced at a time of social unrest, when Japanese railway workers were being laid off, ''Heavy Industry'' was an indictment of reckless capitalism. In ''Law of the Jungle,'' a huge, mysterious animal with a zipper mouth lunges forward menacingly as smaller creatures scurry out of its way, and a trio of hear-no-evil, see-no-evil, speak-no-evil monkeys huddles in a corner. Okamoto called the picture's central monster a symbol of fascism.</p>
        <p>''Based on what he had learned in Europe and experienced back in Japan, Okamoto developed the idea of 'polarism' that he tried to express in his art,'' said Keinosuke Murata, the director of the Taro Okamoto Museum. Mr. Murato spoke recently in his office, which is situated at the tapered end of a wing of an oddly laid-out building that he refers to with amusement as ''a fortress.''</p>
        <p>He explained that polarism allowed Okamoto to address both abstract and surrealist values at the same time within a single work. It offered him a way to grapple simultaneously with avant-garde art values and the complicated social reality he saw emerging amid the physical destruction and spiritual void of postwar Japan. Okamoto, who once asserted that ''content has priority over form,'' recalled in 1959 that he had been interested in how his art ''would have an effect on society, not only as something aesthetic, but also as a cry or movement in everyday life.''</p>
        <p>The Japanese art critic Ichiro Hariu has described Okamoto's polarism as ''a philosophy that called for venturing into the depths of contradictions without trying to bring them together with easy solutions or compromises.'' It lay at the heart of Okamoto's art-making and his outlook on life.</p>
        <p>For younger Japanese artists like Ushio Shinohara, who was born in 1932, Okamoto's attitude was especially inspiring. Mr. Shinohara helped found the Neo Dada Organizers, a short-lived anti-establishment group, in 1960 and has been based in New York since 1969. Hiswork has evolved from found-object, junk-assemblage pieces to exuberant, crosscultural paintings in a rollicking pop-art mode. ''Okamoto's energy was like Picasso's,'' Mr. Shinohara said. ''It was big and infectious, and it liberated us.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Shinohara recently showed a mural-size painting in an ''Homage to Taro Okamoto'' exhibition at the Kawasaki museum. A riot of writhing, cartoonish figures, it was entitled ''Taro Okamoto Working Outdoors, From Arizona Sunrise to Bermuda Sunset.''</p>
        <p>Okamoto published books on traditional and modern art. He did extensive research on the pottery of the Jomon era, dating back more than two millenniums; experts regard the era as one of the most important sources of Japan's indigenous culture. Okamoto admired hand-shaped Jomon pots for the crude beauty of their ropelike designs, seeing in them the confrontation of aesthetic values that so intrigued him. He also traveled south to Okinawa, photographing folk festivals, ceramics and local costumes along the way. Carp-shaped banners fluttering above working-class neighborhoods, a baby asleep in a handmade basket, a shaman absorbed in her candlelit incantations: his pictures make a record of Japanese folk life as vivid as any of Japan's black-and-white movie classics of the postwar period. The Okamoto museum now holds thousands of these photographs.</p>
        <p>In the late 1950's, Okamoto began making sculpture, and it is in his vast outpouring of three-dimensional works that his main themes and interests probably assumed their most engaging forms. Evoking the flicker of a sorcerer's ceremonial flame, tribal totem poles and the streamlining principles of classic modernism, he created the imposing ''Tower of the Sun'' for the Expo '70 world's fair in Osaka. He also made bronze temple bells, lighting fixtures, molded-plastic sofas and cocktail glasses etched with masklike face designs. (Okamoto served as artistic director of Expo '70. An exhibition focusing on his ''Tower of the Sun'' and related designs for the fair will be on view at the Kawasaki museum from Oct. 28 through Jan. 28, 2001.)</p>
        <p>Life-affirming bright red, a symbol of good fortune in much of East Asia, was Okamoto's favorite color. The entrance to the permanent collection of his work in Kawasaki is a futuristic tunnel-corridor painted hot red and bathed in red light. Multilevel galleries display paintings, drawings and objects of various sizes and materials; each room is part stage set, part design showroom, where spindly tentacles and bulbous growths sprout from Okamoto's nature-inspired sculptures. Visitors are even encouraged to sit on some of the artist's flower- or hand-shaped chairs. Mr. Murata, a former senior administrator at the National Museum of Art in Osaka, said: ''Until recently, most Japanese museums have not tried to be aesthetic experiences in themselves. But this one definitely has.''</p>
        <p>Although Okamoto took part in a number of the Japanese modern-artists' associations that emerged during the postwar years, he was in spirit something of a loner. He never married. He was well-liked and more gregarious than flamboyant. Still, he was no Salvador Dali. In some ways, his works, especially his political-allegorical paintings, have become dated souvenirs of a Japan that now seems as remote as the ancient Jomon age, even though it existed only half a century ago. Still, even to Japanese artists who have come of age since the death of Emperor Hirohito in 1989, Okamoto often remains a role model for his lifelong, unbridled display of what used to be called spunk.</p>
        <p>Yasumasa Morimura, for example, who has become world-famous for photo-collage re-creations of classic paintings by Western modernists in which he himself appears, has stated that Okamoto ''is very attractive as a performer.'' Mr. Morimura believes audiences feel compelled to go ''meet'' Okamoto's work, not to go ''see'' it in a conventional sense.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shinohara, who recently visited Barcelona and is now working, he says, on a large painting in which ''Pokemon meets Gaudi's organic-architectural shapes,'' echoed that assessment. ''Okamoto's greatest contribution was his powerful, emotional style,'' he said. Today, while many Japanese both within and outside the art world are still smarting from the economic blues, a whiff of that effusive energy alone may be worth the price of admission to a museum that celebrates its enduring appeal.</p>
        <p>The Diminishing Corporate Presence</p>
        <p>In Japan, large corporations have long played an important public role in art and culture. National newspapers have underwritten museum exhibitions; from 1949 to 1963, the annual Yomiuri Independent, held at the Tokyo Metropolitan Museum, offered a popular showcase for artists unaffiliated with the ''official'' salon shows of various art societies.</p>
        <p>Many of Japan's department store chains like Seibu, Mitzukoshi and Takashimaya are well known for mounting art shows in their own galleries. For some, the tradition dates back to the 19th century.</p>
        <p>In recent decades, high-tech companies have inaugurated art spaces that have often focused on works made with video, audio or computer components.</p>
        <p>Such art sponsors have always sought a public relations pay-off for their efforts, but some corporate-supported venues also have helped emerging artists in ways familiar to audiences of alternative spaces in the United States. As recently as 1997, for example, NTT, the Japanese telecommunications giant, opened its InterCommunication Center in Tokyo. It houses galleries, an auditorium, an electronic library and room-size environmental works made with arsenals of digital gadgetry.</p>
        <p>The ICC recently featured a show by the artist-programmer Toshio Iwai. In it, each of Mr. Iwai's glass-covered ''specimen boxes'' contained a media-related device, like a camera, keypad or music box. A visitor could brush a hand gently across the top of each box to activate forces that shot into the air sprays of letter forms or musical notes, complete with tinkling sounds. One box magically generated images of the visitor himself, having them emerge and dissolve on a scrap of empty filmstrip like fleeting visual haiku. ''I consider the writing of each program to be as artistic as the other parts that make up each piece,'' Mr. Iwai said.</p>
        <p>But even a wealthy company like NTT is cutting back. Kenji Nakamura, the art center's deputy director and chief curator, said the center would close from October through March while NTT remodels one of the galleries as a corporate showroom. He said he planned to step down from his post early next year.</p>
        <p>It is now a year and a half since Seibu closed its famed Sezon Museum of Art in Tokyo's Ikebukuro district, and many public museums have been wrestling with cuts in government support. Not surprisingly, both public and private art museums routinely play it safe, putting on noncontroversial exhibitions. Even a traveling Andy Warhol show that recently turned up at the Hiroshima City Museum of Contemporary Art looked tame.</p>
        <p>Rand Castile, a former director of the Japan Society Gallery in New York and of the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco, said that generally ''the new Japanese museums have no endowments to speak of and no assured government support.''</p>
        <p>''And they're in communities that are not accustomed to giving for arts enterprises,'' he said. ''When they were built, no one thought hard times would come.''</p>
        <p>Still, various corporations are pledging support to two ambitious international art festivals. One is the Echigo-Tsumari Art Triennial 2000, which opened on July 20 and will run through Sept. 10 in the six-city region in Niigata, a prefecture north of Tokyo. Another is the Yokohama Triennale 2001, scheduled for September through November of next year.</p>
        <p>Yokohama, the port city south of Tokyo, will expand an already large convention hall and renovate a historic warehouse for the event. The Japan Broadcasting Corporation and Asahi Shimbun are among its organizing sponsors.</p>
