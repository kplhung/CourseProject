        <p>Kerry Sanders, a man with a history of mental health problems, served more than two years in a New York State prison because he shares a last name and a birth date with a violent criminal.

        <p>Kerry Sanders, a man with a history of mental health problems, served more than two years in a New York State prison because he shares a last name and a birth date with a violent criminal. Despite repeated protests from Kerry Sanders that he was not Robert Sanders, the escaped convict whom police were really after, no one at any stage of the criminal justice system took even the minimal steps needed to learn that the wrong man was in prison. Now the New York State Department of Correctional Services is refusing to own up to the negligence of its actions.</p>
        <p>The bare facts, chronicled by Benjamin Weiser in the Aug. 6 New York Times Magazine, are not in dispute. Mr. Sanders was arrested in Los Angeles in October 1993 after spending a night on a public bench. The arresting officer and public defender say Mr. Sanders acknowledged being Robert Sanders from New York, an escaped felon, though he signed documents as Kerry Sanders.</p>
        <p>Incredibly, neither in California nor in New York were Kerry Sanders's fingerprints or photograph compared to those of Robert Sanders. Nor did anyone on Kerry Sanders's mental health team at Green Haven prison in Stormville, N.Y., raise questions about how a prisoner with no previous record of mental health problems (Robert Sanders) had become schizophrenic, and why a New Yorker kept talking about his hometown as Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>The real Robert Sanders was arrested in a drug bust in October 1995, and it was then that the State of New York realized there was a man sitting in Green Haven who had not been convicted of a crime. Kerry Sanders was returned to his mother in Los Angeles carrying $48, a pack of cigarettes, a soda, some medications and deeper mental troubles.</p>
        <p>The family hired a lawyer, who has settled with Los Angeles County for its role in this wrongful imprisonment. But in New York, the case is headed for trial in federal court. That is an outrage given the scandalous negligence and incompetence shown by the state in failing to identify its prisoner properly. The state should negotiate a settlement with Mr. Sanders that would acknowledge its negligence, fairly compensate him for two lost years and provide him with top-notch psychiatric care for the rest of his life.</p>
        <p>On a heartening note, New York's attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, has indicated to this page that he is open to the possibility of settling the case. He said that a settlement would not amount to a dangerous precedent for the state because the facts in the case are ''so unique.'' One would hope so.</p>
