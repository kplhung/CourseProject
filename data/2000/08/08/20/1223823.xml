        <p>LONG ago, when I lived on the Upper West Side, I thought flowers came from the Korean store, communing with nature was a day in Riverside Park and the best way to know if it was raining was to turn on the radio.</p>
        <p>A postcard headlined ''The Four Seasons in New York'' hung on my refrigerator door: A checkerboard of black-and-white photographs, labeled summer, fall, winter and spring, but all the same weather-less street scene.

        <p>LONG ago, when I lived on the Upper West Side, I thought flowers came from the Korean store, communing with nature was a day in Riverside Park and the best way to know if it was raining was to turn on the radio.</p>
        <p>A postcard headlined ''The Four Seasons in New York'' hung on my refrigerator door: A checkerboard of black-and-white photographs, labeled summer, fall, winter and spring, but all the same weather-less street scene. Typical New York bashing, I thought, by jealous bumpkins not tough enough to live in the city of George Steinbrenner and Rudy Giuliani.</p>
        <p>Then my job took me to California, first the Bay area and later Los Angeles. There nature ruled, sometimes with tooth and claw, but more often with nourishing beauty: the scent of jasmine outside the kitchen window, the hummingbirds nosing into the trumpet vines, the ribbons of fog advancing and retreating through the Golden Gate Bridge, the tropical stillness of the Pacific Ocean off Coronado Island and its dark poundings against the cliffs of Big Sur.</p>
        <p>I planted a garden, with professional help, that wound up featured in Sunset magazine, a running joke among my East Coast friends. I was the one, after all, who once bore the humiliation of a correction when I wrote of ''the scent of new forsythia'' in a story about a February false spring. Forsythia has no smell, a botanist was quick to inform the newspaper of record.</p>
        <p>So when work brought me back to the metropolitan area, I went looking for light, air, vistas, flowers and found them a mere half-hour from Midtown. I also found the four seasons, not the monochromatic city version of my old postcard or the subtle passages in California, like the winter rain in San Francisco or the June gloom in L.A.</p>
        <p>Here, there are hurricanes that swell the brook that crosses my property. Thunderstorms that crack the sky with lightning and leave behind a sulfureous smell. Sweet spring evenings when the sun drops behind the Palisades, the Hudson River sparkles and fireflies dance. Dewey summer mornings when I read on the covered porch, shaded by clematis vines.</p>
        <p>I water the garden in summer, salt the driveway in winter, alternate the storms and screens. In winter, I bring in firewood. In spring, I dust off the lawn furniture. In summer, I plug in the bug zapper and fire up the grill. In autumn, I drag my feet through leaves just to hear the rattle and crunch.</p>
        <p>With the seasons come anticipation and heartache. For months I await the sea of daffodils, nearly 2,000 in all. Too quickly they are gone, and it is time to braid their tatty foliage, a task as soothing as weeding after a hard rain. A succession of flowers follows, bringing a rush of excitement when they bloom and a lurch of disappointment when they fade. The last are the hydrangea, deepening in color as summer ends.</p>
        <p>I dream of the roses and bougainvillea that bloom all year in California, never ending but always the same. Seasons mean less there. People vacation throughout the year, thus the world does not stop spinning in August. No one is traumatized by the annual exodus, simultaneously, of every therapist and hairdresser in town. There is no magical day when a convertible appears on the highway for the first time in a year.  No switching wardrobes on Labor Day.</p>
        <p>This disquisition on the seasons is prompted by the approaching end of summer, all 93 days of it, such a vast expanse in childhood and now over almost as soon as it's begun. The lap-swimmers are counting down the days at the village pool. Soon, it will be too dark to ride a bicycle after work.  At the yoga studio, with its wall of windows facing the Hudson, the light fades by the end of early evening classes.</p>
        <p>I envy the children. Color War is over, and the camp buses have returned. While mothers unpack trunks and do load upon load of laundry, their youngsters are relentlessly singing the marches and alma maters that make no sense in the context of home. But soon, they will be distracted by new school clothes, freshly sharpened No. 2 pencils and the annual chance to invent themselves anew.</p>
        <p>For adults, the transition to fall is more wistful than promising. Manhattanites with fat wallets are filling their datebooks with new plays, operas, films. I will cut and dry the hydrangea, to bring nature inside when the windows go dark by 5. On Madison Avenue, florists sell bouquets of dried hydrangea for $20. It makes me feel smug.</p>
