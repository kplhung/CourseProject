        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''The Law's Spirit, Over Its Letter'' (Aug. 6), which looked at how David Link is establishing a faith-based law school at St. Thomas University in Minneapolis:</p>
        <p>In discussing Mr. Link's days at a Chicago firm, the article described how he once persuaded a client to increase its acquisition bid for a company that he found had undervalued its inventory. Certainly, it was correct, and ethical, for him to advise his client of the error. But the client also behaved in an ethical manner by raising its bid.</p>
        <p>Many business people would have problems, however, with a lawyer who, faced with a similar situation, disclosed the error to the target company before advising his client.  Lawyers must remember that they are counsels, not the decision makers in complex business transactions.</p>
        <p>Say a lawyer discloses such an error to his client, but finds that his client won't raise its bid. He should withdraw from the case. But if that lawyer discloses the error before talking to his client, he should be terminated and reported to the bar association.</p>
