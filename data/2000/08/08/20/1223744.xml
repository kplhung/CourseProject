        <p>''Let me tell you a story,'' the designer Emanuel Ungaro said the night I went to see him. It was the beginning of summer, and half of Paris was in a hurry to get out of town for the weekend. Ungaro wasn't going anywhere. He had come home from work and gone straight to bed with a cold. When he finally entered the room where I was waiting, his face looked as puffy as a French roll. His voice was warm. ''It's a true story,'' he said. ''A woman who is a client orders a dress, and when she wears it, her husband says, 'Your dress is so chic, but you look so bad in it.'''</p>
        <p>I laughed but it wasn't a funny story. It was the kind that sets your mind working with what someone once called ''the belated eloquence of the inarticulate.'' I had just finished telling Ungaro about my first experience ordering an haute couture suit -- Chanel, black faille, vaguely hourglass in shape -- throwing in for drama my doubts about having entered such a perilously chic world.</p>
        <p>Now I realized I had stepped on a plank -- and Monsieur was about to chop it off.</p>
        <p>''A lot of women,'' he said, ''lie to themselves. They lie.''</p>
        <p>Bang.</p>
        <p>Of course, some of this thrusting was due to the fact that I had chosen one couture house over the others, and, Paris fashion being not much sweeter than Commodus's den, I was bound to see my choice carved up into bits. Yet, I think, Ungaro had a point. Haute couture is not for the faint of heart any more than it is for the cheap of purse. A woman who thinks of herself as smart, who reads the magazines and wears the latest fashion, can go into a couture fitting room -- where four or five people, including men, are standing around staring at her in her pathetic silk underwear (so pretty that morning) -- and suddenly realize she knows nothing about herself. She's an outsider, a marauder. ''Just let me ... slip ... out ... the door.... ''</p>
        <p>As it is, there are not more than a thousand women in the world who have what it takes to play this game on a regular basis. For a while last spring, I was one of them.</p>
        <p>Haute couture is the only provenance of fashion that concerns itself with the individual -- the client. Sure, the semiannual shows attract thousands of journalists who crank out tons of copy, but they, for reasons of money and lifestyle, do not wear the clothes themselves. They are, in a sense, out of the game. A reporter can interview one of the regular clients, like Anne Bass, Deeda Blair or Nan Kempner, who's been buying couture for 50 years, or one of the newcomers, like France Goldman or Suzanne Saperstein, who bring along their husbands (and occasionally their bodyguards). But there will always be a gulf between what these women experience in the fitting room and what they are able to articulate about it. It's like asking a Formula One driver how he makes his car go so fast.</p>
        <p>Much of the allure of going to Paris and having clothes made on your body is, frankly, erotic, though clients rarely put it that way. ''Today everything can be brought to you, and you don't have to see or meet anyone,'' said Jean Paul Gaultier, who's had such a big success in couture since he started doing it three years ago. ''So I think that couture, because you have to go for the fittings, see people and let them touch you, is like a sexual thing. It's something very human.''</p>
        <p>A client I know who has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on couture told me: ''There's something nice about going every season to Paris -- the rituals. You go to the Ritz. Your room is filled with flowers from friends and designers. Does that happen in America?'' She laughed and said, ''It's a story, really, of seduction.''</p>
        <p>With something less than seduction in mind, I went to Paris in April to visit the workrooms of Christian Dior, Yves Saint Laurent and Chanel. I could have picked a dress from any house, yet I chose Chanel. I felt that since this was my first foray as a client (and unless my ship comes in, probably my last), I ought to play it safe. And I liked Karl Lagerfeld's ultrafeminine spring suits, with their small shoulders and flaring skirts.</p>
        <p>But as I was to discover, there is nothing safe about ordering a couture suit, and the only way to appreciate what's happening is to accept that one is a total amateur. Of course, your confidence will be blown -- that's the first thing that goes in a couture fitting. The other is what you think you know about yourself in clothes.</p>
        <p>Suffice it to say that The New York Times paid for the suit, not at full price, but at a figure closer to what a client might pay for the sample, or what a house might charge if the customer were a young girl that it wanted to keep -- a ''jeune fille price.'' So there's flexibility, though relative, as suits cost between $15,000 and $25,000, and evening clothes much more. Some clients are not above summoning a tear if they think it will lower the price. Kempner told me she once sobbed in the salon at Dior. Did that work? I asked her. ''It worked,'' she said.</p>
        <p>So I arrived at Chanel on the appointed morning and went to the top of the stairs, where Joy Henderiks, the salon director, was waiting. Though I had seen the show in January, it now hit me that from this point forward, until my suit arrived six weeks later, all my decisions would be personal rather than professional. Henderiks, sensing my panic, suggested we get down to business. Having rehearsed this moment in my mind, I flung off my pique dress and stood there in my black high heels, black underpants and Wonderbra. This last was my idea of perky joie de vivre. Boy, was I bush league.</p>
        <p>It's hard not to feel self-conscious in a fitting room, harder still when the clothes seem intended for a doll. I could barely get an arm into the samples, and had to resort, like most clients, to holding them up, paper-doll style, as I assessed myself in the mirror and pretended to be loving the whole thing. I knew what Hel ne de Ludinghausen, the salon director at Saint Laurent, meant when she said, ''A woman comes for a dream, but suddenly she's looking at herself in the mirror and that is not her dream.''</p>
        <p>Lagerfeld tells a story that says a great deal about how to face this. He was fitting Marlene Dietrich for a suit when she told him: ''I know all my defects. My neck is too short. My hands are not beautiful. The ankles are O.K., and the rest is not so great. Who cares if you know?'' Exactly.</p>
        <p>Once I had struggled into a black faille suit with a long jacket and full skirt, there was a murmur of consensus, with many c'est bon's. By then, a small crowd had gathered, including Madame Jacqueline and Madame Christianne, who head the two Chanel ateliers. Later, I would meet the premiers at the other houses -- Jean-Pierre, who has been with Saint Laurent for 35 years, and Raphael, the good-looking chief tailor at Dior.</p>
        <p>The thing you sense right away about these people is that they each have an incredible eye. They know what looks right, and you'd be a fool not to trust them. There was a moment, in fact, when I almost wished I had gone to Dior for a suit. I was surprised by the way John Galliano's tramp collection had been cleaned up, and how busy the workrooms were filling orders, including one for a ruby taffeta dress bought by a prominent New York lady nobody would ever guess was shopping at Dior after all the show's negative press. But in the end that's not what tempted me. It was Raphael. I was curious how this young guy would see me.</p>
        <p>There are three fittings in couture, and a few days later I returned to be fitted in a muslin version of the suit. People had warned me about the muslin -- it exaggerates everything. And from what I could see, I had Dietrich beat in the defect department.</p>
        <p>It would be nice to say that I immediately grasped the suit's sophistication and its effect on my eye. But the initial fitting grants few such epiphanies, and even though I write critically about clothes, I was hardly prepared to give a bright opinion when the fitter asked, tugging at my jacket, ''How does it feel?'' Relative to what -- an Armani jacket? A Gap T-shirt? Let me just say the fit in couture is so exact, so close to the body (five different measurements were taken of my back alone) that I couldn't see myself even lifting an arm to hail a taxi. Yet miraculously, within an hour of my first wearing the finished suit, not only could I move my arms freely, I could imagine twisting myself into one of those Dovima-among-the-elephants poses. That's how incredibly comfortable the suit felt.</p>
        <p>But as I say, this wasn't my first thought as I stood in the glaring white muslin. It was: Great, here stands Betty Boop. (Lagerfeld, I ought to point out, could be of no help at this stage; like most designers, he avoids client fittings. ''It's not in my contract,'' he said glibly. ''I speak to the press, but they are working class like me.'')</p>
        <p>Haute couture is an institution both degenerate and profound. No house makes money; the loss is obviated by the tremendous publicity the shows generate. Today, largely because of shows and liberal employee benefits, a couture suit costs 10 times what it did in the 60's, when Balenciaga was king and a single workroom could be kept busy just filling the orders of Bunny Mellon or Mona Bismarck, who even had clothes made for gardening. Indeed, there exists in every house stories of clients whose whims Paris coddled like new eggs. De Ludinghausen told me about a princess who wore only black and white, arriving alternately at Saint Laurent in a white or black Rolls. Another client wouldn't step into the fitting room until a sheet had been laid down, and Lagerfeld told me of a lady who brought her maid with her, just so she'd have a place to hang her pearls.</p>
        <p>Today, of course, the private jet has replaced the ladies' maid -- and to the old guard, like de Ludinghausen, things aren't as much fun. ''The people who come now, they don't know anyone,'' she said. ''They stay at the Ritz, they go to a few shows, they hope to be photographed by Women's Wear Daily, and that's it. In the past, you had to learn the game if you wanted to be in it. Now you can be a billionaire and still not be in the group.''</p>
        <p>Yet, it's also true that since the end of World War II society has grown more democratic, and even if one appreciates the quality of couture, nobody needs it the same way women did before the advent of deluxe ready-to-wear. As it is now, some clients don't even bother going to Paris -- the fitters are sent to them. Not surprisingly, very little of the new tech wealth has reached couture. As Sidney Toledano, the president of Dior, explained: ''The new generation is very quick. They are flexible.'' And couture is very slow and traditionbound. It takes 100 hours or more to make a suit, and every stitch is done by hand. There's no way to change that, but to executives like Toledano, it's also clear you can't snare new money with old hooks. ''We have to find a better way of communicating,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In June, I returned to Paris for the last fittings, and it was during these 45-minute sessions with Jacqueline that my suit was transformed -- literally molded on my body. With pins, she narrowed the sleeves, adjusted the neckline and agreed with Henderiks that the proportion would be better if the jacket were longer. At one point I noticed Jacqueline frowning at my bosom, and I looked down. Where in the toile fitting there had been two ample mounds, there were now, in the faille, two sorry foxholes. I guess my Wonderbra, which I had worn only for the first fitting, had worked, except it meant that Jacqueline had to open seams and bring the jacket (and me) back to reality. That's how precise the fit is.</p>
        <p>Of course, when the finished suit arrived in New York, packed in tissue in a large white box printed in heavy face with ''Chanel 31, rue Cambon-Paris,'' it was perfect, and I marveled that something that had taken so many hours to make, and was obviously exceptional, could feel like nothing when it's on. I understood why couture is made by hand. A machine could not have imparted the same feeling of ease and lightness.</p>
        <p>But this is not the beauty of my suit. Outwardly, to an unsophisticated eye, it may resemble a very good suit of a certain, if vague, French style.</p>
        <p>But inwardly it tells a more complex story, one based on illusion and hidden seams and the way one feels rather than looks, an emotional quality -- do I dare say chic? -- that is, in an age of knowingness, almost a secret thing.</p>
