        <p>Rivellino Jones of the misspelled name was refereeing a soccer game in Manhattan last week, a moral victory for Coach Marty Jacobson. Perhaps those other embattled friends of thelipsite@aol.com, Linda Bensel-Meyers and Billy Bean, could take heart from Jake, although hang in there is almost always the hardest advice to follow.</p>
        <p>Bensel-Meyers, the whistle-blower at the University of Tennessee, is facing the start of a football season in which she has been portrayed as the Volunteers' most dangerous opponent. The team has just started practicing and Bensel-Meyers has already informed the National Collegiate Athletic Association of three freshman players who turned in remarkably similar compositions. She calls it institutional plagiarism and blames it on the mores of the university rather than on the athletes or tutors.</p>
        <p>Most people in Knoxville call it harassing the program. The N.C.A.A. might not even find it in violation of whatever it is that concerns that trade organization.</p>
        <p>Bensel-Meyers has been decrying, for some time now, what she sees as the exploitation of athletes and the subversion of the humanistic values of the academy. A professor of Renaissance literature and drama, she is also in charge of the first-year composition program. She is only recently being heard beyond the world of the Orange.</p>
        <p>In what I found the most cynical and clear-eyed approach to the issue, Frank Cagle, the managing editor of The Knoxville News-Sentinel, simply brushed it off. He wrote that the ''fate of the football team has a deep impact on the morale, the business and the general economy of East Tennessee'' and that what might be construed as corruption in college sports was a ''national scandal, not a local one. And it requires a national solution.'' In other words, keeping our boys eligible by any means necessary is a priority not to be tampered with unless every other school goes honest, too.</p>
        <p>Bensel-Meyers is idealistic and fuzzy-minded; she sees universities using a bottom-line corporate model in which athletes are resources. Even the coaches and athletic administrators end up being victimized, especially if they don't win.</p>
        <p>''My immediate problem is how do I avoid being cast as a harridan because I harp on the issue,'' she said last week. ''The administration's problem is that you can't put the peel back on the orange once you see what's underneath.''</p>
        <p>Bean, an outfielder whose six major league seasons on three teams were haunted by the secret of his homosexuality, has decided he wants to be back in baseball, the binding thread of his life since childhood. Since he used his sports background to build functioning teams in two restaurants, he thinks he can use his business background in a front office. He would offer a rare combination of experience and skills, as well as a test of sports' institutional homophobia.</p>
        <p>His open, often moving description of life in a major league closet last year in a front-page story in The New York Times led to a number of speaking engagements and television appearances. In talking about baseball, he realized he had not resolved that critical part of his life; he had left before his career was over. Even now, at 35, he tries to stay in playing shape and appear regularly on talk radio; he is still gripping the ball.</p>
        <p>Bean is in the process of selling his current Miami Beach restaurant, Mayya, and writing to baseball club executives. He said last week that he understands that a team would have to be ''courageous'' to hire him.</p>
        <p>Coach Jake's message has always been simple: don't quit. A recovering drug abuser long clean, a soccer coach in a basketball culture, an advocate for kids among clock-watching bureaucrats, Jacobson's saga has been struggle.</p>
        <p>Since 1996, when his Martin Luther King Jr. High School team won the first of its three straight city championships, mostly with recent immigrants from the West Indies and West Africa, Jake has been controversial in and out of his school. He was suspended from coaching for 11 months last year when rival coaches accused several of his players of being ineligible. He was reinstated and vindicated, although his team lost in last year's championship final.</p>
        <p>Like Bensel-Meyers, he is self-righteous and insistent on putting the needs of the individual student ahead of the institution. Like Bean, his charm masks a willingness to work harder than most. And like them both, he has a larger vision. Jake thinks the future of American soccer will rise from the cities.</p>
        <p>To that end, the New York City Parks Department's inspired partnership with the Parmalat milk company finished its six-week Summer of Soccer 2000 yesterday. On weekday nights in Riverside Park in Manhattan and Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in Queens, youngsters played six-on-six games under the supervision of parkies and soccer coaches and college players like Rivellino Jones. Jacobson ran the Manhattan program, which included washing the mesh scrimmage vests.</p>
        <p>''Look at that passion,'' he crowed last week as teenagers from Senegal and Brazil and Trinidad stormed up and down the turf with bursts of heart-stopping athleticism. ''This is going to be the urban game. These kids are going to be our future.''</p>
        <p>Rivellino Jones, 22, named for Roberto Rivelino, the Brazilian star, is a symbol of that future. As a 16-year-old Trinidadian overwhelmed by homesickness and a huge, chaotic high school, Jones found his new roots at midfield on the King varsity. He was on Jake's first title team and expects to graduate from Medgar Evers College this year. He says he wants to be a public school guidance counselor and coach. Like Jake.</p>
