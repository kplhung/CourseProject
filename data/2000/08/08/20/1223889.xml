        <p>Kenneth H Brown letter opposes Carol Rocamora's August 6 article on embellishing and modernizing Chekhov's plays (S)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Chekhov's plays are portraits of life in late-19th-century Russia and have nothing to do with Texas, ''The African Queen'' or songs like ''The Yellow Rose of Texas'' or ''Beyond the Blue Horizon,'' as described by Carol Rocamora in her article ''Sad Yet Elated, a Prague Troupe Lives Chekhov'' [Aug. 6].</p>
        <p>These ridiculous embellishments are akin to adding an SST to the background in the ''Mona Lisa,'' or putting a cell phone in Rembrandt's hand in one of his self portraits. Why is it that no one would think of adding to or subtracting from a great painting, but everyone in the theater, it seems, feels free to alter the texture and environment of a great play?</p>

        <p>Ms. Rocamora says that Chekhov would have loved these flights of fancy. As a playwright, I suggest that he would have considered them detestable corruptions of his work by irresponsible parasites. I'm afraid that tinkering with great plays in the public domain is yet one more example of the cultural wasteland in which we live.</p>
