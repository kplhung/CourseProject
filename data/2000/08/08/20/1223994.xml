        <p>Beth Ellen Zasloff, a daughter of Tela and Joseph Zasloff of Pittsburgh, is to be married today to Joshua Steckel, a son of Barbara and Steve Steckel of Sharon, Mass. Rabbi Sharon Cohen Anisfeld will officiate at the Pine Cobble School in Williamstown, Mass.</p>
        <p>Ms. Zasloff, 27, will keep her name. In September, she is to begin teaching introductory expository writing on the adjunct faculty at the Gallatin School for Individualized Study at New York University. She graduated from Yale University and received a master's degree in fiction writing from Johns Hopkins University. Her father is a professor of political science at the University of Pittsburgh. Her mother is the author of ''Saigon Dreaming: Recollections of Indochina Days'' (St. Martin's Press, 1990).</p>
        <p>Next month, Mr. Steckel, 25, is to begin teaching high-school biology, history and English at the Birch Wathen Lenox School in New York. He graduated from Duke University and received a master's degree in English from Johns Hopkins. His mother, a literacy specialist, consults for the Boston Plan for Excellence, a nonprofit organization seeking to improve public schools. His father is a medical scientist in Boston at Ligand Pharmaceuticals, where he is a liaison to oncologists using the company's cancer-fighting drugs.</p>
        <p>The couple met in August 1998 in Baltimore, when Ms. Zasloff, who was about to begin her master's program, was looking for an apartment and furniture to put in it. A mutual friend introduced them at a bar, where Mr. Steckel and several others from the Johns Hopkins English department were relaxing after a departmental softball game. Learning of her need for furniture, Mr. Steckel pressed her to take his couch, which had been stranded in his old apartment because it wouldn't fit through the front door of his new apartment.</p>
        <p>''It was extremely big and heavy and very hard to maneuver,'' Mr. Steckel said. But it had belonged to his late grandfather, who lived in Brooklyn, and the bridegroom had slept on it during family visits.</p>
        <p>Ms. Zasloff said she would be happy to adopt the couch, and over the next few weeks, the logistics of getting it to her new apartment gave them an excuse to talk repeatedly. After school started, he asked her out to dinner and their romance began.</p>
        <p>''I had fantasies about our grandchildren sleeping on that couch,'' Ms. Zasloff said.</p>
        <p>But when the couple decided in January to move into Mr. Steckel's apartment together, they were faced once more with moving the couch. In late May, the day before the lease on Ms. Zasloff's apartment was to expire, they cleared the bride's remaining belongings. That night, they found themselves too exhausted to move the couch to his apartment with the rest of their things and decided to put the job off for a day.</p>
        <p>''We left it in an alley thinking it was too heavy for anyone to steal,'' the bride said. ''We came back later and found that it was gone.''</p>
