        <p>Bone marrow cells that would normally turn into tendon, cartilage, bone, muscle and fat can also turn into nerve cells, scientists report. All that is needed is to add a simple mixture of chemicals to a broth that nourishes the marrow cells in the laboratory. While cautioning that the work is in its earliest stages, researchers say it may eventually offer a new source of nerve cells to treat spinal cord injuries or diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.</p>
