        <p>Quotes from some political jokes by Indonesian leader and quipster Abdurrahaman Wahid; photo (S)</p>

        <p>THERE is no such thing as a political movement based on jokes, President Abdurrahman Wahid once wrote. But Mr. Wahid himself may be the evidence to the contrary.  He jokes to relieve tension, to instruct, to make a point. In fact, his address to parliament last week sounded a bit like a nightclub act.</p>
        <p>One joke, suggesting the need for cross-cultural understanding, involved a non-Muslim bus driver who was knocked unconscious in an accident. As he lay dying, a Muslim urged him to save his soul by calling out the name of Allah.</p>

        <p>THERE is no such thing as a political movement based on jokes, President Abdurrahman Wahid once wrote. But Mr. Wahid himself may be the evidence to the contrary.  He jokes to relieve tension, to instruct, to make a point. In fact, his address to parliament last week sounded a bit like a nightclub act.</p>
        <p>One joke, suggesting the need for cross-cultural understanding, involved a non-Muslim bus driver who was knocked unconscious in an accident. As he lay dying, a Muslim urged him to save his soul by calling out the name of Allah.</p>
        <p>''Say the name! Say the name!'' the man insisted.</p>
        <p>The bus driver opened his eyes briefly and murmured, ''Grogol,'' the name of the next stop on the line.</p>
        <p>Here are a few more.</p>
        <p>* Why in the tough times of former President Suharto did so many Indonesians go to Singapore for dental work? Were dentists in Indonesia so inferior?</p>
        <p>No, it was not that. It was just that nobody in Indonesia was allowed to open his mouth.</p>
        <p>* One day Suharto was caught in a flood and rescued by a farmer.</p>
        <p>''Do you know who I am?'' he said. ''I'm the president of Indonesia. As thanks, I'll give you anything you want.''</p>
        <p>''I just want one thing,'' said the farmer. ''Please don't tell anybody I rescued you.''</p>
        <p>* When Mr. Wahid, who is virtually blind, was elected last October he named his taciturn rival, Megawati Sukarnoputri, as vice president.</p>
        <p>''This is an ideal team,'' he said. ''The president can't see and the vice president can't talk.''</p>
        <p>* An undertaker was unable to fold the hands of a corpse. The body was stiff and one arm remained outstretched.</p>
        <p>''What can I do?'' he asked the local religious leader.</p>
        <p>''What was the man's profession?''</p>
        <p>''He was a policeman.''</p>
        <p>''In that case,'' said the religious leader, ''just put 10,000 rupiah in his other hand and he'll bring his arm down.''</p>
        <p>* Mr. Wahid was reported to have told this anecdote to President Clinton:</p>
        <p>Winston Churchill was taking a walk with Clement Atlee, the Labor prime minister at the end of World War II. Churchill said he needed to relieve himself and asked for some privacy.</p>
        <p>''Why?'' Mr. Atlee asked.</p>
        <p>''Because,'' said Churchill, ''whenever you see something big you want to nationalize it.''</p>
