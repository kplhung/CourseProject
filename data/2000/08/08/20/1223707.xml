        <p>YEARS ago, when I left the law to try my hand at another kind of fiction -- specifically, serious novels -- many of my barrister colleagues argued forcefully that I was making a mistake.

        <p>YEARS ago, when I left the law to try my hand at another kind of fiction -- specifically, serious novels -- many of my barrister colleagues argued forcefully that I was making a mistake. What they feared was not so much that I wouldn't succeed (failure was a given), it was that I would be set adrift and flounder away unanchored -- the kind of shaky situation that drives lawyers nuts. Several books later, I'm not unaware of the extent to which the lawyers' perspective is different from that of the people who are their clients, spouses, lovers and friends.</p>
        <p>Recently I took part in a symposium on law, literature and culture sponsored by the Center for the Humanities at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. I was asked to participate not as an academic (I'm a law professor as well as a fiction writer now, teaching human rights and a course in law and literature) but as an insider, a witness to the life of a lawyer and the art of a novelist.</p>
        <p>Exhibit A, if you will. People sometimes wonder about the intersection between the literary and the legal because, today anyway, the two professions can't seem to get enough of each other. Writers want to be lawyers, if you take as a measure the sheer quantity of fiction turned out in which lawyers are alluringly depicted, humanized so that they come across like sympathetic common men. And lawyers, particularly former prosecutors, often turn up as the authors of courtroom thrillers or books on the trials of the day, with all their lurid and confessional dissection of private lives.</p>
        <p>The fact is, literature has always been in love with law. Well, more like love-hate. Most novelists, thank goodness, haven't pursued law degrees, for all the stories they've set within the law and among lawyers. If Dickens, Dostoyevsky, Melville and Shakespeare had had a lawyer's training or perspective, they wouldn't have written what are among the true masterpieces of the form -- novels and plays in which legal structures crush the spirits and take the lives of some of the most victimized protagonists in all literature. Most lawyers see the world through a much narrower lens than writers do, one that has no aperture for the emotions. Some of this has to do with training. The rest, I suspect, can be attributed to personality traits that draw many people to study law in the first place.</p>
        <p>Yet for all literature's interest in law as a subject, the connections between literature and law, or among novelists and lawyers and judges, for that matter, are not immediately and plainly clear. Lawyers, after all, aren't known for a particularly artistic personal style. And with their ''wherefore,'' ''whereas'' and ''pass the said salt'' clauses, they are rarely thought of as elegant writers. (Of course, anyone who has ever read one of Cardozo's opinions knows that had he written fiction, we might have ended up reading him in English departments as often as we do in law schools.)</p>
        <p>But both the literary and the popular cultures have a curious fascination with the moral lessons that emanate from trials. Perhaps injustice is best revealed in a public encounter, even when the day of reckoning doesn't actually produce a just result. And confessions are obviously more dramatic when voiced in a witness box than in a private confessional. When fixed in the gaze of the law and caught within its gears, the accused is forever transformed. And so are we. Like highway rubberneckers, we find the spectacle of accusation and judgment too irresistible for us to avert our eyes.</p>
        <p>Examples abound, in high art and low, in children's stories and in airport novels, in the Bible's commandments, transgressions, judgments and unredeemable punishments, in ancient Greece, with Sophocles' ''Oedipus Rex'' and in Shakespeare's imaginings of moneylenders in Venice. Dostoyevsky sought to understand the moral conscience of the human soul through a murder in St. Petersburg. Camus uses his exploration of an existential crisis in Algeria as a way to reflect how clueless and heartless the law can be; Richard Wright exposed a similar judicial indifference toward racism in Chicago. In ''The Book of Daniel,'' E. L. Doctorow reminds readers that during times of political paranoia, fairness and due process are replaced by accusation and betrayal. And Dickens showed how bleak a house can become if it allows itself to be consumed by a lawsuit.</p>
        <p>In the end, though, the common bond between the professions shouldn't really come as much of a surprise. Literature and law, after all, are nothing without the written word. Language is the common art form. How else could novelists and attorneys tell their respective stories? For both the lawyer and the novelist, it's all in the narration, how they choose to tell it and who is listening. But that's where the similarity ends, and why lawyers, for the most part, have confined themselves to writing legal thrillers or courtroom dramas. The real stuff of literature is what happens outside the courtroom, even in novels where the law is both a character and a plot device. It is precisely where the novelist routinely travels that lawyers and judges fear to tread.</p>
        <p>When clients visit attorneys, what they want to do is cry, but lawyers know only how to sue. The novelist is a practitioner who specializes in crying. The lawyer comprehends the world in terms of formal complaints. The novelist realizes that when human beings feel hurt and violated, a primal scream is just another way of articulating a grievance. What they want most is a chance to grieve; they just don't have a name for it. And so while novelists and attorneys both rely on the power and persuasion of words, they are essentially speaking different languages.</p>
        <p>The lawyer thinks in terms of legal authority, clarity and precision, where there is no room for ambiguity. The novelist is ruled by an authority invested in the emotions. And as everyone knows, with emotions nuance is everything, nothing is clear and turmoil is guaranteed. Novelists are much more interested in the inner life of human beings -- what they feel, how they experience and express pain, the insults and indignities that drive some people to exact a pound-of-flesh vengeance. When faced with such a situation, the law limits its inquiry to matters of equitable carving: where to make the incision without shedding too much blood.</p>
        <p>The lawyer occupies a narrow sphere of existence, as if life can be reduced to a clinical exercise. Human conduct is measured only in terms of what a reasonable person would do under similar circumstances. And with its emphasis on evidentiary rules, settlement negotiations and privileged communications, the law continually seeks to limit the scope of a story.</p>
        <p>But in literature, the writer-reader privilege requires full disclosure. The vistas and landscapes of life are endless; it's all a matter of what gets revealed and when. The pain of injustice doesn't go away, it simply comes back as pathology. More than anything else, the novelist wants to know what the irrational man has to say. For many, the law is something to latch on to. It provides structure, an institution that seems safe and dependable, where there are resolutions and remedies to all of life's varied conflicts. In literature, such misplaced faith is seen as the ultimate fiction. Shylock may ''crave the law''; Portia knows the mistake in such blind reverence. The novelist inhabits a world of messy irresolution. In art, even after the final chapter, there is no closure, no final judgment.</p>
        <p>It's not merely that lawyers are tainted by the numbness and routine of the system, the interior world of mazes that Kafka -- yes, he was a lawyer -- terrifyingly conjured up in ''The Trial.'' It's that the imperative to keep one's distance from emotional upheaval cuts lawyers off from the essence of human experience.</p>
        <p>Is it any wonder that in legal thrillers in which lawyers are the protagonists, they are often presented as solo practitioners, misfits, loners and drunks, people in desperate need of a redemptive second chance? That's when lawyers' lives make for interesting fiction, when they are as emotionally open, vulnerable and disordered as the clients they serve.</p>
