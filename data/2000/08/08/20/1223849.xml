        <p>Over the past few years, blazing star (Liatris), a native North American plant, has emerged as a standout in sunny cottage gardens, formal planting schemes and inspired flower arrangements. The spicata species has tall (3 to 5 feet) spiked flower heads that appear bristly or wooly from a distance. Liatris ligulistylis is shorter, with more open flower spikes. The purple varieties of liatris are the most popular, although if you have an all-white garden, you can sometimes obtain white blazing star (Liatris spicata 'Alba') for the back of the border.</p>

        <p>Liatris can be used in almost every situation, except a shady one. It is drought resistant, non-invasive, native and a big hit with butterflies and birds. It also dries well for winter arrangements. The only thing it doesn't seem to do is repel deer, so include it in protected beds.</p>
