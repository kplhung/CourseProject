        <p>In  golf, 63 is a magic number  the low score in the history of all four major tournaments. And with Jose Maria Olazabal of Spain shooting a nine-under-par 63 today in the P.G.A. Championship at Valhalla, it has now happened 19 times, including twice by Greg Norman.</p>
        <p>But Olazabal, four strokes behind the leader, Tiger Woods, going into Sunday's final round, figured he would need another 63 to win.</p>
        <p>''I think 18 under has a chance,'' Olazabal, a two-time Masters winner, said with a smile. ''But it is not certain, that is for sure.''</p>
        <p>Of all the golfers who shot 63 in a major, only four went on to win that particular tournament: Johnny Miller in the 1973 United States Open at Oakmont, Jack Nicklaus in the 1980 United States Open at Baltusrol, Raymond Floyd in the 1982 P.G.A. at Southern Hills, and Norman in the 1986 British Open at Turnberry.</p>
        <p>Norman also shot 63 in the opening round of the 1996 Masters, which he lost to Nick Faldo in a final-round collapse.</p>
        <p>Olazabal's low round in competition is a 61. He shot that in winning the 1990 World Series of Golf at Firestone in Akron, Ohio.</p>
        <p>''I think this one is as good as that one,'' he said, alluding to the Firestone round. ''I would take both rounds as the best I have ever played. I wish I had played the first day like I did yesterday and today.''</p>
        <p>Olazabal opened with a 76 on Thursday, then shot 68 in Friday's second round. In last week's Buick Open at Grand Blanc, Mich., he had an 81.</p>
        <p>''I didn't feel my game was all that bad even though I shot 81,'' he said. ''Sometimes when we shoot a 66, we didn't play all that well. This is just the opposite. When I started, I was just looking to find more or less the same game I had yesterday. And after I birdied No. 10, I started thinking I had a chance for a low score.''</p>
        <p>Off the tee, Olazabal missed only the second fairway, but he birdied that 535-yard par-5 with a wedge to within a foot of the hole. He also birdied the fourth from 3 feet, the fifth from 12 feet, the ninth from 5 feet, the 10th from 3 feet, the 12th from 3 feet, the 13th from 4 feet, the 15th from 15 feet and the 16th from 12 feet.</p>
        <p>''On 18, I couldn't go for the green in two; I'm not as long as Tiger is off the tee,'' he said of the 542-yard final hole, where a birdie would have given him a record 62 in a major. ''On my third shot, I went for the flag and just hit it a couple of yards to the right. From there, just to make two putts, it was good enough.''</p>
        <p>Asked if the heavy rain early Friday had softened the greens and made Valhalla more vulnerable, Olazabal preferred to credit his colleagues.</p>
        <p>''Tiger is making us work harder,  and we have to improve our games so we can have some chance of beating him,'' he said. ''That is the reason why. We know we have to attack the golf course. We have to attack the flags. We have to go for a low number to have a chance.</p>
        <p>''But I want to say that it is not discouraging to see Tiger scoring so low. I think we are seeing a player that is playing extremely well. It is up to us to improve our game. It will take hard work and hopefully we will be able to get closer and closer to him.''</p>
        <p>Olazabal, who won once on the European tour this year, missed the 36-hole cut at the Masters, finished in a tie for 12th in the United States Open and in a tie for 31st in the British Open.</p>
        <p>In last year's Ryder Cup match, the 34-year-old Spaniard's failure to hold a 4-up lead on Justin Leonard in the Sunday singles enabled the United States team to complete the biggest comeback in Ryder Cup history. Asked how long it took him to get over that loss, Olazabal smiled.</p>
        <p>''About two or three hours,'' he said.</p>
