        <p>Re ''One Drug Store Too Many, One Grocery Too Few?'' (July 16): The statement by the CVS spokesman that ''we consider ourselves to be good corporate neighbors'' could not be farther from the truth.</p>
        <p>We have the misfortune to live behind their store at 96th Street and  Amsterdam Avenue, and are subjected to noise from their air-conditioning system almost 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The system is regulated by computer from CVS headquarters in Rhode Island. Complaints lodged with them and their local managers fell on deaf ears.</p>
        <p>We finally had to call in the Department of Environmental Protection, which cited them for ''unnecessary noise.'' Thus far, no action has been taken. Another CVS is the last thing our neighborhood needs.</p>
