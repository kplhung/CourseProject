        <p>Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and George Tenet, director of central intelligence, are at odds over the extent to which the United States should release documentation of its involvement with repressive Latin American regimes in decades past.</p>
        <p>During a visit to South America this week, Dr. Albright pledged to push for the ''fullest possible declassification'' of files related to the coup that toppled Chile's elected Socialist government and the 17-year military dictatorship that followed.</p>
        <p>She also promised to start reviewing for release documents about Argentina's ''disappeared'' and their children, victims of state-sanctioned kidnappings during successive regimes between 1976 and 1983.</p>
        <p>''This has been something that the president and I have not only supported but have been instrumental in making sure it happens,'' Dr. Albright said in Chile on Thursday. She added: ''The whole enormity of the project reflects our commitment to clarify the historic record of a highly controversial period in our bilateral relations.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Tenet recently notified members of Congress that he had decided to withhold an unspecified number of documents about Chile on the grounds they would disclose too much about how his agency conducts its business.</p>
        <p>''These materials present a pattern of activity that had the effect of revealing intelligence methods that have been employed worldwide,'' Mr. Tenet said in an August 11 letter to lawmakers.</p>
        <p>The documents had already been cleared by the C.I.A.'s own declassification experts as part of the last and largest release of interagency files related to Chile, which is scheduled for September 14.</p>
        <p>President Clinton last year ordered the national security agencies to ''retrieve and review for declassification documents that shed light on human rights abuses, terrorism and other acts of political violence in Chile'' between 1968 and 1990.</p>
        <p>''I think you're entitled to know what happened back then, and how it happened,'' Mr. Clinton said at the time, referring to covert American actions that aided the rise of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, who led the junta that overthrew Chile's Socialist president, Salvador Allende Gossens.</p>
        <p>The president's initiative, which began after the arrest of General Pinochet in London at the request of a Spanish judge, has yielded about 7,500 documents so far, most of them from the State Department. Archivists who have reviewed the redacted documents say none of them reveals the C.I.A. role in destabilizing the Allende government.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tenet said he would submit the withheld documents for a final interagency review, and insisted, ''We are in no way trying to withhold information embarrassing to the United States government.''</p>
        <p>But advocates of a broader declassification of documents voice concerns that Mr. Tenet is doing just that: withholding details of American complicity in the overthrow of a democratic government and, by extension, in the repressive regime that followed. They accuse the C.I.A. director of flouting the spirit of Mr. Clinton's order.</p>
        <p>''I think we're witnessing an internal division within the administration,'' said Daniel Weiss, a spokesman for Representative George Miller, a California Democrat. ''We believe the president genuinely wants to see the full story on Chile and the United States told publicly.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Weiss said the C.I.A. chief apparently wants to withhold information ''that would speak unfavorably of the United States. But that's the historical process. That's the integrity we're trying to establish, to understand fully what took place in Chile.''</p>
        <p>The outlines of C.I.A. operations in Chile have been in the public domain for a quarter century.</p>
        <p>American records related to recent repression in Argentina are not expected to provide as rich a historical trove. That country's first military coup, in 1976, coincided with the election of President Carter, whose human rights campaign strained ties with the architects of a ''dirty war'' that eventually killed more than 15,000 people. But the United States was well apprised of Operation Condor, a plan by South American regimes to arrest dissidents in one another's countries.</p>
        <p>The White House declined to say whether President Clinton would back up the openness of his top diplomat or ratify the caution of his spymaster. David Stockwell, a spokesman, said the matter is still under review.</p>
        <p>''We want to ensure that the American public has access to as much information as possible about human rights abuses, terrorism and other acts of political violence during and prior to the Pinochet era in Chile,'' Mr. Stockwell said. ''Of course,'' he added, ''the president has confidence in George Tenet.''</p>
