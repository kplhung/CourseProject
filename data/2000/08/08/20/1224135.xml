        <p>The water bikes that glide along the river here invariably attract a good amount of attention. Office workers, people chatting on cell phones, tourists -- they all hang over the side of bridges to stare, take pictures and ask where they, too, can rent the curious contraptions.</p>

        <p>The water bikes that glide along the river here invariably attract a good amount of attention. Office workers, people chatting on cell phones, tourists -- they all hang over the side of bridges to stare, take pictures and ask where they, too, can rent the curious contraptions.</p>
        <p>And this is before they've even laid eyes on the Venetian-style gondola, complete with the warbling faux Italian gondolier, which conveys mostly romance-seeking couples up and down the river for evening tours of the skyline.</p>
        <p>The once indifferent residents can hardly be faulted for their newfound sense of enchantment,  since barges and clunky commuter boats are what they're used to seeing along the waters of the Chicago River.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the bikes, the gondola, the open-air cafes and the planters bursting with purple pansies are just the beginning of a multimillion-dollar construction plan, inspired by the city's mayor, Richard M. Daley, to turn what has long been a polluted industrial waterway into a gleaming tourist attraction. Among other things, the plan calls for a continuous, grassy pathway along the river, dozens of new cafes, canoe rental stands and more docks offering access to the river.</p>
        <p>The city has already spent $15 million building a river walk and adding an art gallery at the base of one of the river's bridges. Officials say that over the next three years they plan to spend $50 million more to widen the river banks to make way for more commercial development.</p>
        <p>''The river hadn't been much to look at for a long time, and now, it doesn't even smell bad anymore,'' said Gene Arbetter, a lifelong Chicagoan who rents out his river bikes from the serene dock he shares with Old World Gondoliers.</p>
        <p>''Just the other day, I came right up on a blue heron just around this bend,'' said Mr. Arbetter, pointing to a wooden piling that was sprouting what looked like a miniature herb garden. Just overhead, taxi cabs and buses rushed over a bridge and an elevated train rumbled past.</p>
        <p>Jeff Hutson, the owner of Old World Gondoliers (and a gondolier himself), is even more rapturous about the river's new incarnation.</p>
        <p>''The romance is back,'' said Mr. Hutson, who uses the stage name Goffredo when rowing and  singing to his customers in Italian. ''These people get dressed up, bring wine or Champagne -- it's really quite breathtaking.''</p>
        <p>Although the Chicago River's branches and tributaries stretch for 150 miles, the new revitalization effort focuses on the main stem of the river, which runs through the heart of downtown Chicago.</p>
        <p>Many say the river has become a symbol of how the city has changed from a gritty meat-packing town to a vibrant, clean city of art museums, neighborhood festivals and outdoor restaurants.</p>
        <p>''What we're seeing is an industrial city changing into one of the fastest-growing office sectors in the world,'' said Laurene von Klan, executive director of the Friends of the Chicago River, a group that tends to the river's overall health. ''To some extent, the old image of us being the slaughterhouse to the world is giving way to a new city, where tourism is the main industry.''</p>
        <p>Some developers are recognizing the shift. In the past, many buildings effectively turned their backs on the river. But that has changed, and now the river is a hot residential market, with real estate advertisements boasting of river views and builders making town houses with huge front porches facing the water.</p>
        <p>''For the most part, the river has been an unrealized asset until now,'' said Patti Gallagher, the city's deputy commissioner of strategic planning. It wasn't until about three years ago that Mayor Daley got hold of some rough plans that had languished in Ms. Gallagher's department for a new and improved riverfront, at which point the renaissance began.</p>
        <p>But selling the river to Chicago residents, many of whom still see it as less than pristine, might still be tough.</p>
        <p>''It's still an unhealthy green color,'' said Jason Ur, a graduate student in archaeology at the University of Chicago. ''You can see quite a bit of garbage floating in it.''</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Ur was somewhat won over on a recent river outing, during which he and a group of friends paddled up the river in kayaks.</p>
        <p>''I wasn't so much interested in being in the water as I was in the views of the skyline,'' Mr. Ur said.</p>
        <p>Although Ms. von Klan maintained that the health of the river's water has improved, she admitted she would not swim in it.</p>
        <p>''A group of us is talking about doing it -- one day.''</p>
