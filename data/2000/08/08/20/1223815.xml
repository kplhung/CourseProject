        <p>THE whole world is watching!'' chanted demonstrators outside the First Union Center in Philadelphia during the Republican National Convention this month. Many had not yet been born when that cry first sounded on the streets of Chicago, in 1968, as the police clubbed protesters during the tumultuous Democratic convention. This time the words were unwittingly ironic: most of the world passed up the opportunity to watch on television, whether because the convention itself was designed to be noncontroversial or because today's dissidents have not yet gained the fearsome reputation of their elders. The police had evidently declined the role of on-camera head-bashers. But the scene was yet another tribute to the enduring power of the 60's in the national imagination.</p>
        <p>So is ''Steal This Movie,'' Robert Greenwald's biographical movie about Abbie Hoffman, that charismatic exemplar of 60's cultural radicalism, a defendant in the conspiracy trial of the Chicago Seven -- the leaders of the Chicago protest -- and the author of ''Steal This Book,'' among other provocations. According to publicity for the film, which opened on Friday, Mr. Greenwald (who had met Hoffman years ago) was inspired to undertake the project by a conversation with his teenage daughters, who were attracted to the decade's aura of rebellion, as well as its music and fashions, but knew little about it.</p>
        <p>The slogans, sounds and iconic images of the 60's are constantly evoked. They are romanticized, reviled, embraced by fledgling movements as their legacy or appropriated for television commercials (steal this era).</p>
        <p>Yet for all their familiarity, the experience that produced the artifacts eludes replication, in ways that go beyond the usual problems associated with transmuting lived events into the historical and cultural record.</p>
        <p>The 60's produced such a rush of events that the distinction between news and daily life seemed to blur. Besides the Chicago protest, 1968 saw the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy (the latter knocking the shooting of Andy Warhol off the front page), the Columbia University student strike, the student-worker uprising in Paris, ''Prague Spring'' and the ensuing Soviet invasion, and the launching of women's liberation with a demonstration against the Miss America pageant. There is also the difficulty of conveying the spirit of the 60's revolt at a time when many of its attitudes -- sexual permissiveness, hostility to politicians, a preference for rawly expressive music -- have been assimilated into mainstream culture, while the utopian passion that once pervaded them has vanished.</p>
        <p>But the greatest obstacle to representing the 60's in more than cartoonish fashion is that it was thoroughly mythologized even as it was happening. Mass-mediated images of rock stars, hippies and new leftists spread the counterculture and anti-war movement from the East and West coasts to every provincial town in the country. These images inspired events, like Woodstock or the Chicago demonstrations, that were not only recorded and mythified but often designed -- whether by spontaneous improvisation or by deliberate playing to the press -- to act the images out.</p>
        <p>Woodstock, perhaps the most famous 60's event-cum-myth of all, began as a commercial effort to capitalize on the publicity generated by Monterey Pop, the euphoric free festival that had introduced Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, flower children and San Francisco psychedelic lovespeak to a national audience in 1967. Clearly, the promoters didn't count on the image of Monterey being so potent that, two years later, it would attract nearly half a million kids with no intention of buying tickets. But they came, determined to live out the countercultural fantasy despite uncooperative weather and crisis-level shortages of food, water and toilets. ''Woodstock,'' the movie, documented a real experience, but one that was in crucial respects a performance -- even before the filmmakers added their own layer of editing.</p>
        <p>Chicago, on the other hand, was always conceived by its organizers -- especially Abbie Hoffman and his partner in mischief Jerry Rubin -- as an opportunity to show new left political theater on national television. Everything Hoffman and Rubin did, from nominating a live pig for president to representing their small contingent of ''cultural revolutionaries'' as typical of a crowd that was mostly far less militant (and less colorful), was aimed at drawing the media's attention. Of course, the collaboration of a paranoid Mayor Richard J. Daley was essential; but perhaps he, too, took rhetoric for reality.</p>
        <p>The most effective renderings of the 60's have been works of ''new journalism,'' like Tom Wolfe's ''Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test'' and Norman Mailer's ''Armies of the Night,'' that explore, with aesthetic and philosophical sophistication, dissolving boundaries between experience and performance, reality and image, reporting and mythmaking. The only novel I can think of that comes close to capturing the 60's imagination is Marge Piercy's ''Dance the Eagle to Sleep,'' the 1970 tale of a band of underground revolutionaries. It works because the characters come across as more mythic, or allegorical, than ''real''; still, I have the feeling that Mr. Greenwald's daughters would find it puzzling. As for film, whether documentary or fictional, it would seem that endless replays of demonstrators versus cops, hippies frolicking naked in the mud, joints passing around a circle, freaked out Vietnam vets and so on, have had such a numbing effect as to suggest that a fresh image of the 60's is an oxymoron.</p>
        <p>Yet when I heard about Mr. Greenwald's film, it occurred to me that a movie about one of the decade's chief image-makers might find a way out of this bind. Abbie Hoffman self-consciously sought to bring together the largely separate and sometimes antagonistic cohorts of bohemia and the organized new left. In his own person he merged the two central -- if not always compatible -- myths of the 60's rebels: the myth of cultural liberation through libidinal ecstasy and fabulous excess, and the myth of a morally righteous generation rising up against war, racism and materialism perpetrated by its elders. He was, in short, a primary author of the 60's narrative that, in its various bowdlerized and canned forms, is now ubiquitous in our popular culture. And he pulled this off precisely by his keen understanding of the power of media not merely to record reality but to create it.</p>
        <p>Stunts like scattering dollar bills on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, where startled minions of capital scrambled to pick them up, not only condensed a world view into one arresting image, but brilliantly satirized the opposition. Hoffman used this technique to even greater effect during the Chicago Seven trial, in which he wore a judicial robe to court, insisted he lived in Woodstock Nation -- in the state of mind of his brothers and sisters -- and otherwise turned the proceedings into an epic baiting of the judge unlucky enough to share his surname.</p>
        <p>There are rich possibilities here for avoiding the standard 60's banalities -- or restoring the power of now-tired images -- by focusing on the process of their creation. ''Steal This Movie'' adopts a promising strategy for highlighting that process: Vincent D'Onofrio as Hoffman, having gone underground after his 1973 arrest for selling cocaine, calls from his hiding place to hector a young reporter, David Glenn (Alan Van Sprang), into writing his story; the reporter's interviews with Abbie's wife Anita (played by Janeane Garofalo), his lawyer Gerry Lefcourt (Kevin Pollak) and others become, as in ''Citizen Kane,'' the framework for the unfolding of his life.</p>
        <p>That life is portrayed as a creative self-invention in which the gap between public and private disappears, only to reopen with a vengeance when Hoffman becomes a fugitive in 1974. While hiding one's identity is inherently stressful, for Hoffman it signifies total obliteration. Even in absentia, he can't resist trying to commandeer the press; but then he hates Glenn's story. He emerges from a near breakdown only by taking the risk of adopting a new public persona as an environmental activist, Barry Freed, in upstate New York, and even that doesn't quite work. In the 80's, after turning himself in and being paroled, he is portrayed as reintegrating his past with his present, inspiring a new generation of activists. But his 1989 suicide, which is only mentioned in the epilogue, seems to tell another story. While the movie duly records Hoffman's diagnosis of bipolar disorder and his treatment with lithium, the thrust of its narrative suggests that mental illness is never purely organic.</p>
        <p>The best scenes in ''Steal This Movie'' focus on Abbie as media artist. His hilarious demolition of Judge Julius J. Hoffman's court, which made his testimony a showcase for the triumph of an echt-American freedom-loving bad boy over a humorless authoritarian state, loses none of its resonance in the retelling. His wedding to Anita -- featuring an ''intimate'' gathering of hundreds of people and the press, photographs of the happy couple naked with bags over their heads, and wedding announcements with joints enclosed mailed to random strangers -- is a lighter but equally witty sendup of another established institution.</p>
        <p>On the whole, though, the movie fails to make the 60's live. For one thing, its basically conventional dramatic form undercuts the irreverent content. Except for its title and the obligatory television footage, both real and fake, ''Steal This Movie'' does not reflect on its own status as a mass-mediated object; perhaps the reporter who frames the story should have been made a television producer, allowing an offstage ''Abbie'' or a real-life Anita to comment on the action and the actors. Mr. D'Onofrio plays his role straight, aiming to be a realistic Abbie Hoffman with the right accent and mannerisms, with the result that he often conveys an un-Abbie-like air of trying too hard. He might have done better to concentrate on getting across his character's antic spirit, as Jim Carrey did in playing Andy Kaufman.</p>
        <p>It doesn't help that the center of the drama becomes the unmasking of Cointelpro, the F.B.I. program that subjected the new left in general, and Abbie Hoffman in particular, to illegal surveillance and harassment. For most of the movie, Glenn dismisses as paranoid Hoffman's insistence that such a project exists; but in the end he comes around and helps Gerry Lefcourt nail down the evidence. In making this theme so important, Mr. Greenwald -- no doubt taking his cue from his lengthy interviews with Anita Hoffman (who died last year of breast cancer) -- allows his film to imply that F.B.I. machinations were responsible for the collapse of 60's radicalism, as well as for Abbie's travails. As a result, the movie is ultimately recast in the well-worn mold of a muckraking flick: 60's myth meets post-Watergate cliche. In fact, the 60's revolt succumbed as much to its activists' hubris on the one hand, and their fatigue and confusion on the other, as to anything the government did. For that matter, the government's most effective weapon against the movement turned out to be the abolition of the draft. Cointelpro, however vicious, was a sideshow.</p>
        <p>Nor was Hoffman himself simply a victim of the state. Police entrapment or no -- the truth remains unclear -- Abbie sold cocaine, an outrageous risk for someone in his position. ''Steal This Movie'' glosses over this discomfiting fact. Marty Jezer's sympathetic 1992 biography ''Abbie Hoffman: American Rebel,'' on which the movie is largely based, is more forthcoming about Abbie's dark side: the egomania, foolhardy machismo and increasing attraction to the violent sectarian left.</p>
        <p>Two kinds of voices dominate the present conversation about the 60's: those who condemn the utopianism of the time as a totalitarian delusion, and those who sentimentally endow it with a moral purity unknown to today's era of rampant materialism and cynicism about politics. What's missing from both accounts is the 60's as emotional experience: the desire to live intensely, the hope that people could have more than Freud's ordinary unhappiness. For my generation, the pursuit of happiness was not a slogan; it turned our guts inside out and left us with a bone-deep sense of loss. ''Steal This Movie'' makes a stab at expressing this dimension, but in the end it sentimentalizes.</p>
        <p>To my mind, the movie that gets closest to the heart of the matter isn't about the 60's at all: it's ''Thelma and Louise.'' Two female outlaws are transformed by unspeakable hopes for freedom, for a wholly different way of being. They can't go back no matter what. As they leap to their deaths, for one last defiant (and mythic) moment, they are complete. I imagine Abbie would have loved it.</p>
