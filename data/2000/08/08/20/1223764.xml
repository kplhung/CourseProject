        <p>THERE are many places to eat on Fire Island, but only a few at which to dine. The Bay Leaf in Cherry Grove, a newcomer this summer, is one of them.</p>
        <p>It replaces the Monster and, like its predecessor, is an elegant oasis in this casual, laid-back seaside community. The understated, candlelit dining room is decorated with a beige and cream leaf motif on chair cushions, tabletops and wallpaper. An equally pleasing upstairs room has a brick fireplace as a focal point. Adjoining it is an outside bar/deck with water views.</p>

        <p>THERE are many places to eat on Fire Island, but only a few at which to dine. The Bay Leaf in Cherry Grove, a newcomer this summer, is one of them.</p>
        <p>It replaces the Monster and, like its predecessor, is an elegant oasis in this casual, laid-back seaside community. The understated, candlelit dining room is decorated with a beige and cream leaf motif on chair cushions, tabletops and wallpaper. An equally pleasing upstairs room has a brick fireplace as a focal point. Adjoining it is an outside bar/deck with water views.</p>
        <p>Service is Fire Island all the way. Our waiter was nice, funny and theatrical. When we asked if a duck special was good he replied: ''Don't take my word for it. Ask Bill over there.'' We all turned to a fellow diner at a nearby table happily chomping down on the duck and quite willing to give a testimonial.</p>
        <p>Dishes arrive with dispatch and the busboy does a good job of keeping water glasses full, but no one knows who ordered what. A request for ketchup was immediately forgotten, and a missing ear of corn promised with a lobster special brought a response of ''I wonder what happened to it'' from our server. But, hey, this is Fire Island and no one expects precision service. The Bay Leaf is probably as formal as it gets there.</p>
        <p>Service may be quintessential Fire Island, but the food is not. A few of the dishes are ordinary, but the vast majority are of sit-up-and-take-notice quality. The best entree sampled was a pork chop special that falls into the best-ever category. The boneless double chop (about three to four inches thick) was tender and juicy, and was made even better by a creamy wild-mushroom risotto.</p>
        <p>The duck, touted by our neighbor, was nothing special. The meat was succulent but the skin flabby. Better choices are the flavorful linguine with white clam sauce sparked by garlic and fresh thyme, the moist salmon rolled with spinach and baked in puff pastry, the cooked-to-order steak with thin, crisp French fries and a special filet mignon stuffed with roasted garlic and fontina.</p>
        <p>A surprise hit one night was the lobster Newburg pot pie. A Newburg is usually in a sherry-spiked cream sauce. This one was mahogany colored but was very flavorful and loaded with seafood.</p>
        <p>Miz Ruby's ribs were also lip-smacking, but not as fall-away-tender as the classics. This dish, along with a delicious gumbo bursting with chicken, fish and andouille sausage, point to the sous chef's experience in the kitchen of Commander's Palace in New Orleans.</p>
        <p>That gumbo is listed with the entrees but was also the soup of the day on two occasions. Worthy, too, are a trio of salad openers: mesclun with goat cheese and walnuts, field greens with roasted balsamic onions, pine nuts and Gorgonzola and a non-traditional Caesar (a half head of romaine and a cheese-laced vinaigrette) that was nevertheless pleasing. Only a dry portobello mushroom over a bed of undressed mesclun failed to deliver.</p>
        <p>The shrimp cocktail, six firm fellows, stars a spicy tomato-chili sauce called sangrita. It was not available when we ordered the dish, but the cocktail sauce that arrived was delicious and plenty peppy. Tender fried calamari were above average, as were baked clams (four huge shells filled with a tasty, minced clam mixture). A special crab cake takes top appetizer honors: two no-filler patties placed over a pool of cilantro-mint vinaigrette.</p>
        <p>Desserts are delicious homemade treats that make appearing in a bikini the next day an iffy proposition. The apple tart glazed with caramel and garnished with whipped cream and fresh berries is the premier pick. Chocolate lovers will go for the flourless chocolate torte, which has the consistency of fudge. The white chocolate cheese cake was creamy perfection. Gelati and sorbets from Ciao Bella are also offered. Flavors like cosmopolitan (pink-hued, citrus-flavored sorbet), blackberry cabernet and white chocolate-raspberry swirl got thumbs up at our table. As did Bay Leaf itself.</p>
