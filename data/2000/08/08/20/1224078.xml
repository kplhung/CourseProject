        <p>I am outraged, but not surprised, that the country's biggest law firms are cutting back on pro bono work (front page, Aug. 17).

        <p>There is a more basic factor at work here: greed. Associates have been under pressure to produce more billable hours for years. When I graduated from law school in 1994, the industry was in recession, and many firms were going under. But today business is booming. It is absurd for a law firm raking in millions of dollars, and employing hundreds of lawyers at six-figure salaries, to say it cannot afford to have its lawyers comply with rules of professional ethics and donate 50 hours a year to help society's least fortunate members.</p>
