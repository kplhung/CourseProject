        <p>To the Editor: Regarding ''Crime Takes a Vacation (Yours)'' (July 16): We visited Paris during the French Open a couple of months ago. The city was crowded with tourists and the lines were long and tiresome: in short, a paradise for pickpockets.</p>
        <p>My turn came on one of the busiest subway lines in the direction of the Arc de Triomphe. It was standing room only and I was surrounded by three kids, aged maybe 8 to 14. They communicated by eye contact and did not utter a word. They had already established that I did not carry my wallet in my rear pocket but in the right front pocket. As the doors opened, the youngest already had his hands in my pocket.</p>

        <p>I did not feel a thing, but my wife, having found a seat, observed it all. She gave me such a big jerk that the young thief was startled and had to leave the station empty-handed. I was very fortunate.</p>
