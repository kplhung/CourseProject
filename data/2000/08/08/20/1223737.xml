        <p>(Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)</p>
        <p>A PLACE IN THE COUNTRY, by Laura Shaine Cunningham. (Riverhead, $24.95.) Years of fruitless wishing for the great good place finally paid off for the author with a gracious old house upstate; her wisdom is shown by acknowledging that snakes and bad neighbors go with the territory just as flowers and moonbeams do.</p>
        <p>BEN, IN THE WORLD: The Sequel to ''The Fifth Child,'' by Doris Lessing. (HarperCollins, $23.) This spectacularly disturbing story, about a monster born to a happy, middle-class family in England, adopts the monster's point of view; 18 and looking 40, he becomes a drug courier, an experimental subject in a nasty research institute and a disturbing relative of humans who read books.</p>
        <p>MILLIONAIRE: The Philanderer, Gambler, and Duelist Who Invented Modern Finance, by Janet Gleeson. (Simon &amp; Schuster, $24.) A life of John Law, the 18th-century playboy who showed Frenchmen that a piece of paper entitling its bearer to money was itself money, and who organized a speculative corporation that collapsed grandly.</p>
        <p>A RUM AFFAIR: A True Story of Botanical Fraud, by Karl Sabbagh. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $24.) A grave and witty account of a British amateur botanist who in the late 1940's caught a professor faking evidence to suit his theory about the last ice age and the Hebridean island of Rum, then sealed his report of the fraud in his college library (it leaked anyhow).</p>
        <p>MOUNTAIN CITY, by Gregory Martin. (North Point/Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $21.) This memoir of summers spent with the author's grandparents in the desert of northern Nevada deals with the graces of courage and humor, battered by repeated failure in a terrain that virtually forbids success.</p>
        <p>THE QUESTION OF BRUNO, by Aleksandar Hemon. (Nan A. Talese/Doubleday, $22.95.) Mostly fictional (but who can say for sure?) stories and a novella, invoking both the terrible facts of Bosnia and Yugoslavia and the years of the author's childhood, when there was yet hope for both.</p>
        <p>THE GENTLEMAN FROM NEW YORK. Daniel Patrick Moynihan: A Biography, by Godfrey Hodgson. (Houghton Mifflin, $38.) A life of the right's favorite liberal, or the left's favorite neocon, always intelligent, usually correct and at peace with his impending retirement; by a British journalist and longtime friend.</p>
        <p>DRIVING MR. ALBERT: A Trip Across America With Einstein's Brain, by Michael Paterniti. (Dial, $18.95.) A journalist and the pathologist who acquired Einstein's brain in 1955 take off with it, but with no clear idea what to do with it; then they keep going for quite a while.</p>
        <p>LITTLE SAINT, by Hannah Green. (Random House, $25.95.) An evocation of place and time that is also a spiritual biography, about the author and her husband's discovery of Conques in France on the Santiago pilgrimage route and of her growing acquaintance with St. Foy, the girl, martyred in 303, whose amazing reliquary survived the revolution.</p>
