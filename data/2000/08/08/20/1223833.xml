        <p>To the Editor: I am nearing 85, and in the 45 years since I lodged at Lake O'Hara (''Yoho Trails Have Little Traffic,'' July 16), I have never met anyone who knew of the place. I am delighted to learn that it still exists and is not yet approached by a superhighway or defiled by electronic clutter.</p>
        <p>In 1955 the Canadian Pacific dropped me at trackside in the wilderness where there was nothing but a horse barn. One other passenger got off, identifying herself as a summer worker at the lodge. We walked down a grassy bank to the barn, where a young man helped us saddle two horses, and turned over one loaded pack horse for each of us to lead. He pointed across the railroad track and onto the eight-mile trail that provided the only access to Lake O'Hara Lodge.</p>

        <p>Lodge guests were counseled on the proprieties of sharing the habitat with bears, but I never saw one. There were occasional moose, one of which liked to peer through the kitchen window. On hikes through the forest, on scrambles over rocky outcroppings, on visual feasts of lake and glacier I never saw another human being. And I well remember reading my book on perhaps that same quiet porch shown in your photo.</p>
