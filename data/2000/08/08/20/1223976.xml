        <p>With fitted suits, pumps and pearls, this is a season of Park Avenue chic, and the handbag is its centerpiece. The new crop comes in ultraclassic shapes and sizes, from doctor bags to whisper-thin clutches, in luxe crocodile, pampered-prep tweeds and the two-tone shades of a vintage Rolls-Royce. The X factor is quiet opulence.</p>
        <p>THINK BIG, NOT SLOPPY  The most oversize bags will stand up by themselves. Prada's canvas-leather doctor bag ($820), Coach's book tote in purple and fuchsia wool ($248) and J. P. Todd's Penelope bag ($950) hold all. Two-tone patterns keep things neat. ''They're functional, yet romantic,'' said Julie Gilhart, vice president for fashion merchandising at Barneys New York. ''You want to imagine a chic woman stepping on a train -- only now, it's a jet.''</p>
