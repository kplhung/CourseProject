        <p>With fitted suits, pumps and pearls, this is a season of Park Avenue chic, and the handbag is its centerpiece. The new crop comes in ultraclassic shapes and sizes, from doctor bags to whisper-thin clutches, in luxe crocodile, pampered-prep tweeds and the two-tone shades of a vintage Rolls-Royce. The X factor is quiet opulence.</p>
        <p>TWEED IS GOOD  Cut from the same cloth as suits for fall and English manor riding coats, pocketbooks are sporting patterns in elegantly subdued wools. At right is Kate Spade's neatly tailored Madison bag in brown herringbone ($325). At left, Coach's Girlie Donegal bag in brown tweed with patent leather trim ($168). How best to describe the effect? ''Very uptown,'' said Michelle Kessler, accessories director at Vogue.</p>
