        <p>Juliet Suzanne Sorensen, the daughter of Gillian Martin Sorensen and Theodore C. Sorensen of New York, was married yesterday to Benjamin Felt Jones, a son of Barbara W. Jones of Falmouth, Mass., and the late Michael E. Jones. The Rev. Dr. Forrest Church, a Unitarian minister, performed the ceremony at the weekend home of the bride's parents in Pound Ridge, N.Y</p>
        <p>The couple graduated from Princeton University, the bride cum laude and the bridegroom summa cum laude.</p>
        <p>The bride, 27, will continue to use her name professionally. She is to become a law clerk in September for Judge George A. O'Toole Jr. of the Federal District Court in Boston. She received a law degree from Columbia University and was a Peace Corps volunteer in Tinzouline, Morocco, from 1995 to 1997, working on maternal and child health-care issues.</p>
        <p>The bride's father is the senior counsel at the New York law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison and the author of ''Why I Am a Democrat'' (Henry Holt, 1996). He was the special counsel and a speechwriter for President John F. Kennedy; his biography of the late president, ''Kennedy,'' was published in 1965. The bride's mother is the assistant secretary general for external relations at the United Nations.</p>
        <p>The bridegroom, 28, is a candidate for a Ph.D. in economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was a Rhodes scholar at Oxford University, where he received a master's degree in economics, and later was a special assistant in Washington to Lawrence Summers, then the deputy secretary of the Treasury. His mother is an architectural designer and home builder in Falmouth, as was his father.</p>
