        <p>In February of this year, the Public Broadcasting Service showed a new film by the acclaimed documentarian Frederick Wiseman titled, simply, ''Belfast, Maine.'' Its subject, beyond the small coastal town of that name an hour south of Bar Harbor, might be termed ''the other Maine.'' Wiseman's cinema verite captured the largely unseen social reality of the majority of the inhabitants of ''Vacationland,'' its images scattered among, in fact far outweighing, those of the picture-postcard harbor, the wide fields with their autumn rolls of hay, the flower-basket classes, reading groups and amateur chorales that make Maine one of the most popular retirement destinations. Repetitive work in small factories and in service industries, multigenerational legacies of alcohol abuse and poor education, poverty and unemployment constitute life for many native-born Mainers.</p>
        <p>In '' 'I Was Content and Not Content': The Story of Linda Lord and the Closing of Penobscot Poultry,'' Cedric N. Chatterley, a photographer, Alicia J. Rouverol, a folklorist at the Southern Oral History Program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, with Stephen A. Cole, a staff member of Coastal Enterprises, a community development corporation based in Wiscasset, Me., probe in depth the story of one working woman in Belfast. By extension, their book lays out the human costs of downsizing and globalization.</p>
        <p>Linda Lord began working for Penobscot Poultry, a small processing plant in Belfast, shortly after graduating from high school in the late 1960's. Her father had also worked for the company. Lord worked her way up through a series of gruesome jobs, from hanging defeathered poultry on the assembly line to putting birds on a shackle for evisceration to cutting the veins by the birds' jawbones after they had been stunned in the ''blood tunnel'' where she spent most of her years with the company (she called it ''the hell hole,'' because there was so much blood): ''The machine got, oh, maybe 65 to 70 percent of the birds, and the rest I had to do.'' She stayed with it because ''that was top pay. I mean I got the same as the trailer-truck drivers did.'' When the factory closed in 1988, Lord was making $5.69 an hour, ''more than what the people were getting on the line. Maybe 5, 10, 15 or 20 cents more.''</p>
        <p>In the narrative of her 20 years with Penobscot Poultry, elicited in interviews conducted over six years, Lord describes in detail the small indignities of life at the plant -- indignities particular to the poultry industry, but similar to those of any factory job: blood poisoning, rashes and warts from handling raw birds, tendinitis from repetitive hand movements. ''You had to be out over three days to draw on workmen's comp,'' Lord says. ''If you were out maybe one or two days, you just couldn't get anything -- you lost a couple days' work. So a lot of people just kept going.''</p>
        <p>There were more serious dangers at the plant as well. A hose on the poultry foot-cutter let go, and Lord hit her head on the machinery, ''a freak accident,'' she calls it, that cost her the sight in her right eye. The company took three years to settle fully: ''They did play some awful things on people to try and get out of paying.''</p>
        <p>Lord's philosophical acceptance of working conditions at the plant makes them seem more terrible: ''When I first went to work there, my hands were awful sore. They would swell up. You'd go home and you'd soak them and try to get so you could move them. And about when you got up in the morning so you could move your hands, you were back in there and you had to go through it again. Oh, it might take two or three months, and finally your hands get used to it. But it was a job. It was a fairly good paying job for around this area at that time. So, in some ways, I was content and not content.''</p>
        <p>Penobscot Poultry had for years been the largest employer in Waldo County (population 31,000); the plant closing cost 400 workers their jobs and affected the livelihood of some 400 more in related industries. Competition with the South, mismanagement and the high costs of shipping grain to Maine were some of the direct causes of the shutdown. But the closing also reflects the larger trend of consolidation and deindustrialization in Maine and in the nation, a trend that has left hundreds of thousands of workers like those who people Wiseman's documentary with years of service but little education, and little in savings, behind. Lord herself ''defied the statistics,'' Rouverol reports in a chapter on the closing of Penobscot Poultry; ''within six months of losing her job she found work at a local ropemaking factory employing 30-35 workers.'' Her medical coverage for this piecework job is good, though she has no retirement benefits. Still, as Lord puts it, ''Well, I tell you, looking at 10 miles of rope goes a lot faster than watching chickens go by on a line.''</p>
        <p>RouveroL asks, ''Under what conditions does our economic system undermine our efforts to create healthy and stable communities?'' Rather than attempting to draw new industry, or focusing on retraining workers like Lord for competitive jobs in the new economy, those in power in the town and in the state have generally concentrated instead on setting up programs to shelter companies like MBNA America Bank, the credit-card giant, and its information mills; to protect land for the upper-class retirees, which in turn raises property values and taxes, pricing out the natives; and to attract tourist dollars.</p>
        <p>The story of Belfast, as related in this compassionate and sorely needed book, suggests that in the pull and tug between capital and community, capital is coming out ahead.</p>
