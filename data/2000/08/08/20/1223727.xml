        <p>Appearances are often deceptive. On the face of it, nothing was achieved at the recent meeting between Ehud Barak, Yasir Arafat and Bill Clinton at Camp David. Yet everything has changed. For the first time, serious negotiations took place on the volatile issues of Jerusalem and refugees. Jerusalem is no longer a sacred symbol but the subject of hard bargaining. The right of return of the Palestinian refugees is no longer just a slogan but a problem in need of a practical solution.</p>
        <p>The Camp David meeting was one more station on the long and winding road to peace that started at Oslo. The accord between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, signed on the White House lawn on Sept. 13, 1993, and sealed with the hesitant handshake between Yitzhak Rabin and Arafat, represented a dramatic reversal of Zionist strategy in the Middle East conflict. Zionist leaders, before and after 1948, sought to bypass the local Arabs and to reach an understanding with the rulers of the neighboring Arab states. Oslo marked a historic breakthrough because it was the first formal agreement between the two principal parties to the conflict: Israel and the P.L.O.</p>
        <p>The main architect of this revolution in Israel's foreign policy was a 45-year-old deputy foreign minister named Yossi Beilin. Beilin had worked as a journalist and as a lecturer in political science before going into politics in the mid-80's. He quickly established himself in the Labor Party's Young Guard as a militant moderate and as an advocate of equal rights for Israel's Arab minority and reconciliation with the Palestinians -- positions that led some of his colleagues to grumble about his ''Palestinian obsession.'' The Labor Party had been wedded ever since the war of 1967 to the so-called Jordanian option, which saw King Hussein of Jordan, rather than the Palestinians, as Israel's partner in a peace settlement. Beilin denied that there was a Jordanian option, and insisted on tackling the root cause of the conflict. For two decades he consistently maintained that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict could only be settled on the basis of mutual recognition. He also argued that talking to the P.L.O. was an essential condition for an agreement with the Palestinians.</p>
        <p>In ''Touching Peace,'' his introspective and revealing memoir, Beilin gives a fascinating account of the secret talks that culminated in the Oslo accords. Two Israeli academics, Yair Hirschfeld and Ron Pundak, conducted the exploratory talks in the Norwegian capital with representatives of the P.L.O. But it was the junior minister who took upon himself the awesome responsibility for opening dialogue with the enemy without the authorization of his superiors. Beilin did not tell Shimon Peres, Rabin's foreign minister, of the back channel until the negotiators had drafted a declaration of principles for Palestinian self-government.</p>
        <p>Peres immediately grasped the potential in this unconventional diplomatic venture. He persuaded Rabin to give Beilin a green light, albeit a flickering one, and together Rabin and Peres steered the negotiations to their successful conclusion. Beilin pays a handsome tribute to all the members of the ''Oslo club,'' but it is he who deserves the lion's share of the credit for the breakthrough on the Palestinian track.</p>
        <p>If the Oslo accords of 1993 were the turning point, the subsequent discussions in Stockholm reached the heart of the dispute: Jerusalem, the rights of the Palestinian refugees, the future of the Jewish settlements on the West Bank, and the borders of the Palestinian state. The secret talks in Stockholm on these issues were conducted by Hirschfeld and Pundak under the direction of Beilin, and two Palestinian academics under the direction of Arafat's deputy, Abu Mazen. At a meeting in Tel Aviv on the last day of October 1995, the academics presented the fruits of their labors. Abu Mazen was overcome with emotion; when they embraced, Beilin saw tears in his eyes. In their hands they held a document comprising a nearly comprehensive solution to the conflict.</p>
        <p>The Beilin-Abu Mazen plan envisaged an independent but demilitarized Palestinian state covering 90 to 95 percent of the West Bank and Gaza with a capital in Abu Dis, just outside the municipal boundary of Jerusalem as defined by Israel. Israel would annex a strip of land along the 1967 border where the great majority of the settlers reside. Palestinian refugees dispersed throughout the Arab world could settle in the Palestinian state if they chose to do so, but would not be admitted to Israeli sovereign territory. An international commission would either resettle or compensate the refugees, with Israel making a financial contribution to the commission's work.</p>
        <p>The Beilin-Abu Mazen plan met the basic Palestinian demand for independence and statehood. One of the Palestinian negotiators described the plan as ''the deal of the century.'' Beilin had every reason to believe that Rabin would accept it, but on Nov. 4, 1995, the prime minister fell victim to an assassin's bullet. Peres, Rabin's successor, rejected the plan and proceeded to lose the elections of May 1996 to Benjamin Netanyahu, who spent his three years in power trying to subvert the Oslo accords, only to discover that they were irreversible.</p>
        <p>Since the election of Ehud Barak the Oslo process has been back on track, and Yossi Beilin, now minister of justice, is playing a characteristically creative part in pushing it forward. At a meeting of the inner cabinet on June 21, Beilin unveiled for the first time the details of the understanding that he and Abu Mazen reached in 1995. In the subsequent discussion, according to press reports, a consensus emerged in favor of handing over around 90 percent of the West Bank and Gaza to the nascent Palestinian state; even Ehud Barak was said to support the idea. In fact, some of the bolder proposals that Barak put forward at the ill-starred meeting at Camp David were inspired by the five-year-old plan. By placing these proposals on the negotiating table, Barak shifted the Israeli-Palestinian dispute from the realm of symbols and dreams to the realm of reality. The Beilin-Abu Mazen plan has yet to be implemented, but, despite the failure at Camp David, it remains the only game in town.</p>
