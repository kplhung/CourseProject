        <p>THOSE doomsayers who have been forecasting the death of musicals are in a New York state of mind. All they have to do is get out of town. The myth of Broadway as the center of theater persists because myths are needed, more so by tourists from distant lands and the status-starved who are nearer, moneyed or just pretending.</p>
        <p>At Goodspeed Opera's developmental theater, the Norma Terris in Chester, a musical adaptation of the popular movie ''Summer of '42'' is running through Sept. 10, while the East Haddam home theater goes on bringing back oldies, currently ''George M!''. Even the Westport Country Playhouse is to present a musical premiere, the 12th-century French fable ''Nicolette and Aucassin'' starting tomorrow.</p>
        <p>At the National Music Theater Conference of the O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, which ended last Sunday, the search for and development of new musicals has been going on for 23 years. And it was Paulette Haupt, the conference's artistic director, who paired Wally Harper and Sherman Yellin for a new collaboration, ''Say Yes!'',  which opened Wednesday at the Berkshire Theater Festival in Stockbridge, Mass.</p>
        <p>In the Berkshires, new spins on old and new (but not so new) musicals have been thriving this summer. A beguiling example of that second category, ''No Way to Treat a Lady,'' with book, music and lyrics by Douglas J. Cohen, is resurfacing at Barrington Stage Company in Sheffield.</p>
        <p>Here is a musical (first a novel by William Goldman) that has been around since 1987 Off Off Broadway. And the musical version of the 1968 movie (with Lee Remick, Eileen Heckart, Rod Steiger and George Segal) was briefly seen Off Broadway nine years later. Audiences at Coconut Grove in Florida, in London and in Germany, saw it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen's score is a reassuring fusion, a mastery of traditional musical comedy style adorning and informing an offbeat story. The songs, merrily and provocatively, take on a romantic lilt when the subject is pathological and macabre. Sample: An ostensibly grown-up son, never allowed the space to please his abusive mother, sings to her, for approval and repentance, now that she is dead. But she will never be successfully dead. In the song (''What Shall I Sing for You?'') the son sings of Shakespeare and Shaw, of Porter and Gershwin.</p>
        <p>The son is named Kit, an actor and the musical's serial killer who phones in reports of his conquests (read corpses) to Moe, a detective who is really just a cop, his horrid mother laughingly reminds him.</p>
        <p>Both Kit and Moe have very severe mother fixations, which enables Moe's actual inamorata to say that she is jealous of a killer, not just because Moe obsesses about catching the creep. It is eerily clear that the killer is playing disapproving mother to the cop, calling him a middle-aged mama's boy, demanding his gratitude for the fame this front-page case is affording him.</p>
        <p>Well, what else is an unemployed actor to do but act out -- and kill? The quest for celebrity, in whatever form, is just one of the themes of a musical that is to be taken seriously, if only because it does not take itself seriously.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen (whose very good musical, ''The Gig,'' evolved from Waterford to Chester, then to regional theaters) is not concerned about stretching the boundaries of musicals through reinvention and all those other trendy terms. Nor is he formulaic or derivative, no matter the familiar echoes.</p>
        <p>The dread meeting between inamorata and horrid mother, Sarah and Flora, is transformed into a funny song (''So Much in Common'') and it all begins with each man's plea: ''I Need a Life.''</p>
        <p>The ingenuity of the musical's staging by Rob Ruggiero, associate artistic director of Theater Works in Hartford, takes multiple casting to an audience-astonishing level. ''No Way to Treat a Lady'' is to be the Hartford theater's first musical production next year.</p>
        <p>In addition to Karen Murphy taking on five roles, unrecognizably and disparately, Bradley Dean as Kit kills suavely and scarily in such guises as the kindly Father Fitzgerald; a flamenco dancer named Ramon and Tony, who bakes ''the pizza you die for.''</p>
        <p>Sandy Binion as Sarah, ''one of the beautiful people,'' gives a performance that really travels. She is lonely. She is assertive. She is funny. She is level-headed and she is hot-headed. And she scores a home run with every song.</p>
        <p>Which leaves Adam Heller, a fine schlumpy and touching Moe, and now you can count the actors, but not the roles.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen's homicidal musical comedy keeps going around, and he keeps writing more.</p>
        <p>''No Way to Treat a Lady,'' Barrington Stage Company, Consolati Performing Arts Center, Sheffield, Mass. (413) 528-8888. Performances through next Sunday.</p>
