        <p>AS if man's inhumanity to man were not enough, human treachery has now extended to the realm of machinery at Mount Sinai Medical Center where a small, innocent robot named Lil Jeff is regularly hazed by fellow employees.</p>
        <p>Jeff, a staff member in the hospital's sterile processing department, rolls approximately eight miles each day delivering specialized surgical instruments to more than 24 operating rooms in Mount Sinai's Guggenheim Pavilion. Although most surgical instruments are prepared and laid out in operating rooms well before surgery, Jeff's mission is to deliver instruments that surgeons unexpectedly need.</p>
        <p>Armed with large circular lights and sensors in front, a double grip handle on top and an electronic screen that would intimidate even the haughtiest of plasma monitors, Jeff stoically serves day after day, year after year, saving lives and lifting a burden from fellow hospital workers who, without him, would have to walk those same miles in their own shoes.</p>
        <p>And what does he get in return?</p>
        <p>''Practical jokes,'' said Patricia Jenkins, the department supervisor and Jeff's boss. ''They try to confuse him. Sometimes someone is standing in front of him, and so he tries to go around them. But when he turns in the other direction, they step in front of him that way.</p>
        <p>''People also cover his sensors with plastic coffee cup covers,'' she added. ''It doesn't hurt him. But he can't get around again until we take them off.''</p>
        <p>Jeff arrived at Mount Sinai eight years ago as part of an effort to free the department's human workforce from the often daylong task of delivering instruments and other sterile supplies to the operating rooms. A cross between R2-D2 and a hairless Cousin It, Jeff is a rolling metal box. Officially named the Helpmate Robot, he stands 4 feet 7 inches high and carries his parcels in an internal storage compartment that looks like a small bread oven. For navigating, he is equipped with a computerized floor map as well as his sensors and lights and is programmed to say 15 English language expressions like ''Thank you,'' ''Please stand clear'' and: ''I am trapped. Please call the operator.''</p>
        <p>Jeff, manufactured by Pyxis Corporation of San Diego, costs $160,000. Mount Sinai rents him for $700 per month. The hospital also uses another model robot in its pharmacy. (Other city hospitals that use the Helpmate robot include St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan and Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx.)</p>
        <p>Ms. Jenkins said Jeff carried the workload of at least one employee, a bargain at the $5 an hour it costs to use him. Jeff has also allowed her staff, as well as the operating room nurses, to concentrate on more intricate tasks than walking up and down halls.</p>
        <p>So why the pranks? Those who work directly with Jeff regard and protect him as they would a child. The pranks tend to be perpetrated by those just outside his inner circle. Ms. Jenkins's theory is that those who seek to trip him up are merely extending the usual dubious honors they would to any co-worker with a unique personal style.</p>
        <p>''People think of him as human,'' she said. ''So I guess they treat him that way.''</p>
        <p>To prove her point, she called out to a passing X-ray technician, ''What do you think of Jeff?''</p>
        <p>''I love him,'' the technician replied. ''I try to bump him whenever I can.''</p>
        <p>''See what I mean?'' Ms. Jenkins said with a shrug.</p>
        <p>Still, the usually even-tempered robot is not without a healthy spirit of retaliation.</p>
        <p>''He gets attitude at times,'' said Dennis Sanchez, a member of the department, as he scrubbed down surgical instruments. ''He says: 'My way is blocked. Please move the obstacle.' If people don't do it, he doesn't move.''</p>
        <p>But to Tamara Vishnyakova, another departmental worker, Jeff is the perfect colleague. He never complains, never refuses work and has no personality conflicts, at least none that he generates.</p>
        <p>''He's our baby,'' Ms. Vishnyakova said.  ''When he's not working, we don't say he's out of order. We say baby's sick. Sometimes we put little things like a hat on his top and gloves on his handles when it's cold. And he never goes to the bathroom. He never calls in sick. And he's always there for overtime.</p>
        <p>''My boss from my old job -- I was at Beth Israel -- called me and wanted to give me a job again,'' she added. ''He said he would give me a promotion and whatever I want. I asked him if he had a robot. He said no. I said: 'No robot? I'm not coming back.' ''</p>
