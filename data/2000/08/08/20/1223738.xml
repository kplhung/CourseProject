        <p>TWENTY miles southeast of Vienna, vineyards sweep down from a line of low, wooded hills to a shallow lake, and Eastern Europe begins. Austria's present-day frontiers with Hungary and Slovakia may be a few miles farther on, but the shift from central, Alpine Europe is sudden, dramatic and unmistakable.</p>
        <p>This magical landscape is undersung. The reedbeds and wetland of the Neusiedler See stretch to a skyline that vanishes in the haze. Cherries, walnuts and almonds flourish; storks nest on the rooftops; spoonbills and great white egrets gather to breed. The wines are delicious. You sleep well under wide skies.</p>
        <p>The tranquillity is deceptive. The dangers and ironies of history abound. Until a referendum in 1921, this was not part of Austria at all, but western Hungary. Citizens of Sopron, handsome capital of the region, voted to remain in Hungary, but the village of Raiding, birthplace of Franz Liszt, Hungary's most famous composer, became Austrian. The Austrians called their new province Burgenland; to the Romans it was part of Pannonia. It has always been border country, and until 1700 was regularly raided and occupied by Ottoman Turks. Eleven years ago, when the Hungarians cut the barbed wire near Morbisch to let East Germans into the West, they did so on a site sacred to Mithras, the Roman god of light who battled against darkness. Where the Romans have been, their spirit never quite goes away, and this is where the end of Communist Europe began.</p>
        <p>Last summer I wanted to see if Pannonia retained any common identity, a quest that went out of the window as soon as I discovered how enormous the region had been. Instead, my friend Howard and I devised a more local, ragged oblong route of our own -- out of, and back to, the Vienna airport. Four nights near the Neusiedler See in Austria were followed by four in Hungary, and a final one back in Austria. We took our time, and drove fewer than 500 miles.</p>
        <p>The mysterious Neusiedler See -- Lake Ferto to Hungarians -- is roughly 18 miles long and 4 miles wide. It is the only steppe lake in Western Europe, rarely more than seven feet deep, and fed by underground streams. It has been known to evaporate completely. On the western shore, we stayed at Kloster am Spitz in Purbach, halfway between the village and the hills. This is like a French vineyard-restaurant with rooms -- but properly Austrian, and seasonal in its cooking. No fewer than six dishes on one menu honored the high summer rites of the Eierschwammerl, the delicious wild mushroom of Central Europe, a cross between porcini and chanterelles. The Eierschwammerl came terrined, roasted, souped, sauced for pork medallions, sauced for beef, and as a vegetarian goulash with tiny marjoram dumplings.</p>
        <p>With the scents of thyme and sage on the air, and crimson oleanders in tubs, Purbach  begins to feel Mediterranean. Each evening we walked down the hill after dinner, with planes winking in to land far above and fireflies round our feet. Ahead, a great silence settled over the lake.</p>
        <p>We were also traveling in the steps of two Pannonian prodigies who changed the course of Western music: Josef Haydn, last and greatest of composers to write most of his music as the contracted servant of one patron; and Franz Liszt, first modern superstar, forever on the road. There are two delightful small Haydn houses in Austria, at Rohrau and Eisenstadt, while fabled Eszterhaza, Prince Nicholas Esterhazy's ''little Versailles,'' where Haydn transformed the classical symphony and invented the string quartet, still stands, on the Hungarian  side. For 40 years, the Iron Curtain severed the roads of duty taken by Haydn between the palaces of his master, and the link between Raiding and Sopron, where Adam Liszt presented his son in public for the first time. The phenomenal boy was 9, the acclaim tumultuous.</p>
        <p>It is hard to lose the Esterhazys for long in this corner of Europe; they were its little kings. Managing to be both Hungarian patriots and loyal to the Hapsburgs, they were twice offered the crown of Hungary by enemies of Austria, and twice turned it down. Eisenstadt, miniature capital of the kingdom, and 30 minutes' drive from Purbach, sits sweetly among vineyards in a bowl of wooded hills. The main street of this small town has been anesthetized by prosperity -- the retail shops could be anywhere -- but just beyond it are a prince's palace, a composer's home, a merchant's synagogue, two Jewish cemeteries and the plump little Baroque church, which shook joyfully  through the 1790's with the faith and passion of new Haydn Masses.</p>
        <p>For nearly three centuries, the Ester hazys protected ''their'' Jews in seven specific ghetto communities, of which this was one, safely within view of their own sumptuous palace, inspired by the Villa Farnese in Rome. Hidden from the street on the first floor of the merchant Samson Wertheimer's house, an early 18th-century synagogue survived both Kristallnacht and the community's destruction, becoming an intimate and tender Jewish museum -- Austria's first -- in 1978. After visiting the synagogue, we went up the road to its Christian contemporary, the delectably compact Bergkirche, where Haydn is buried. Attached to the church is the Baroque Kalvarienberg whose architect built a staircase past life-size Stations of the Cross inside a kind of honeycombed teapot. When you emerge on the lid, or roof, you are met by white limestone angels and look over folds of russet tiling to glorious countryside beyond. Despite the grim tableaus within, this is one of my favorite buildings anywhere.</p>
        <p>The eastern and southern shores of the Neusiedler See are largely now part of an Austro-Hungarian national park, and most of the lakeshore is inaccessible by car. You can walk, bike or ride on causeways through the reeds to the water's edge. We stayed at the faintly preposterous Vila Vita and Holiday Resort Pannonia near Pamhagen, where every building in the compound was a weirdly perfect imitation of some Pannonian archetype outside. But Vila Vita is only a 15-minute bike ride from a spectacular bird reserve. Surrounded by wind-swept, silvery grassland, with old water pumps and observation shelters dotted round the rim, the Lange Lacke is a large pond, where I saw one of the most beautiful birds I have ever seen. Over three feet tall, dazzling white, with a lemon yellow beak and long, slim neck, the great egret posed against a stand of reeds like a figure on a folding screen.</p>
        <p>Nearer the Hungarian border is a modest Hapsburg palace by the great architect of the Belvedere in Vienna, Lucas von Hildebrandt. Schloss Halbturn stands poised between two worlds: at the top of the vineyard by the gates you look west and see the faint blue line of the Alps; in the park below the house is a delightful neo-Classical church that would be at home in Tolstoy's ''War and Peace.'' The morning we were there, swallows and martins were diving low over the vines, and cherries had stained the road to the border a disturbingly dark red.</p>
        <p>On the Hungarian side, we could see a flag, an abandoned shed, a pole-barrier collapsed on the ground; in Austria, a wheatfield grown to the line was surveyed by a saint on a stone pillar and three soldiers, armed. This pattern was repeated everywhere: the Austrians were still watching, the Hungarians were not. It would have been easy to walk out of the European Union, harder to get back in.</p>
        <p>The transition between the two countries is a real one. For all its beautiful brochures, Hungarian tourism is only reluctantly geared to its principal client, the German-speaking market. Hungarians do not enjoy speaking German, and are often unwilling to hazard their English. So it is not as easy to move around as it is in Austria.</p>
        <p>That said, I retain great affection for  Sopron (pronounced SHOP-ron), a walkable and remarkably well-preserved city of 60,000 people where the sidewalks gleam in the rain like Venice and the shop with the little elephant statue on the corner still sells bottled peas. On the second evening, after a long storm, it became dry enough to explore the layered, ancient structures behind Sopron's little courts and doorways. These include the intact shells of two medieval synagogues, one of them identified only in the 1950's. One of Europe's sleeping beauties, Sopron is also the best base for visiting Eszterhaza, the apricot-colored palace that brought cutting-edge music to a marsh at the end of the world.</p>
        <p>This was my fourth visit to Eszterhaza in 17 years. It exerts a deep spell, yet its neglect by Hungarian governments before and after 1989 is a disgrace.</p>
        <p>True, they have fixed the wiring, the water supply and the roof; there are concerts in Haydn's frescoed music room, and a festival every July. But the air of a management that does not know what it is dealing with, and would rather not deal with it at all, remains overwhelming. The gardens are shabby, the park overgrown. There is no imagination and no love.</p>
        <p>Visitors to the Rococo palace still take the guided trudge round two dozen or so underfurnished rooms in felt slippers that are falling apart. Minimal information (''On the Baroque table are a clock and two candlesticks from France'') is still delivered with an indifference bordering on revulsion. No one is encouraged to enjoy the Haydn exhibition, which, new in 1982, has now faded to lifeless sepia; as you go around, there is no music at all. And yet, I return because I love the music of Haydn, who made a revolution here, and because, even with mass tourism now virtually at the gates, the elegiac spell survives.</p>
        <p>There is no shortage of love and imagination a few miles down the road in the whitewashed manor house of Nagycenk. What a difference! This was the home of Count Szechenyi, Hungarian radical patriot and conservative rival of Kossuth, who built the Chain Bridge between Buda and Pest, transformed the waterways of Hungary, and went mad after the failed revolution of 1848. The rooms are full of interest, and the story is movingly told on English-language headphones.</p>
        <p>Driving deeper into Hungary, we reached Sarvar, halfway between Sopron and Lake Balaton, where we stayed in a spa hotel -- the best for miles around -- almost entirely occupied by gentle seniors of Austria, Germany and Switzerland who consumed fiercely prescriptive, calorie-counted meals.</p>
        <p>Nearer Balaton, at the ruined fortress of Sumeg around which battles between Christianity and Islam swirled for half a millennium, history is now privatized, replayed as kitsch, and served by a new village of tawdry shops and holiday homes.</p>
        <p>The real village of Sumeg is half a mile round the corner, and miraculously intact. The bishop's palace and garden, combining Turkish wooden balconies and a Chekhovian terrace with the sassy ease of Hungarian baroque, is being brought back to life.</p>
        <p>Back in Austria, Schlaining was the first of four massive former Hungarian fortresses that we saw in a fizzy last 24 hours. Bernstein, home of the aviator and Arabist Count Almasy (the hero of ''The English Patient'') and now partly a hotel, was the most patrician of the four, overgrown but cherished, with the family still around. We stayed in a third,  Lockenhaus, a few miles away, where we slept in a Gothic bedroom with the wind literally moaning under the door.</p>
        <p>A glorious new road, the S31, sped us north 20 miles across the hills of central Burgenland on our last morning. The fourth and last fortress was Forchtenstein, where the Esterhazys display priceless family treasures and memorabilia that ring with the Hapsburg, Hungarian and Ottoman histories of this borderland: a Turkish officer's tent, paper-thin ivory vessels, a heron's feather from a magnate's hat. Plus walls full of male Esterhazys portrayed with massive gun dogs swooning loyally at their feet.</p>
        <p>Before this, we had stopped in Raiding at the cottage, embellished by scarlet geraniums, roses and vines, where Liszt was born. White chairs were grouped round a little stage in the garden, for a recital that evening. We longed to stay. The house was given to Austria by the Esterhazys on Liszt's birthday in 1971. It has only two rooms, but they were filled -- to bursting --with great recorded performances of his music.</p>
        <p>In a land of composers and castles</p>
        <p>Getting There</p>
        <p>We rented an Opel Astra automatic from Avis at the Vienna airport, total cost $763 for 10 days. There are several taxes included, among them an airport surcharge of $61, and it probably would be cheaper to arrange a rental in the United States. Prices are calculated with a dollar valued at 15.45 Austrian schillings or 293 Hungarian forints.</p>
        <p>Accommodations</p>
        <p>AUSTRIA: On the Neusiedler See we stayed at the family-run Kloster am Spitz in Purbach, telephone (43-2683) 5519, fax (43-2683) 5519 20, for the excellent food; our room was simple, spacious and quiet with private bathroom and shower. Doubles: $27.75 a person, with full breakfast.</p>
        <p>At the Vila Vita near Pamhagen, (43-2175) 21800, fax (43-2175) 2180 444, www.vilavitahotels.com, a basic, modern double room is $64 a person with breakfast, and a range of sports and leisure facilities.</p>
        <p>A comfortable Gothic bedroom with genuine moaning wind at Lockenhaus Castle, Gunserstrasse 5, Lockenhaus, cost $70 for two, breakfast included. The rooms have private bath, phone and cable TV; (43-2616) 23 94, fax (43-2616) 27 66.</p>
        <p>HUNGARY: In Sopron, we were disappointed by the Palatinus. Best Western's Pannonia Med on Varkerulet 75 looked like a good bet, although we didn't stay there. A double with private bath is $55.40; (36-99) 312180 or 312181, fax (36-99) 340 766.</p>
        <p>About 10 miles out of town, I liked the Hotel Kastely, Nagycenk, where we had lunch. In this comfortable wing of the Szechenyi family mansion, a double room with bath is $44.60 a person; telephone and fax (36 99) 360-061.</p>
        <p>In Sarvar, the Danubius Thermal Hotel, (36-95) 323 999, fax (36-95) 320 406, on the Web www.danubiusgroup  .com/danubius/sarvar.html, is 80's-modern, with rooms in back overlooking an arboretum. Service is fairly efficient but impersonal. Our double room was $102 including breakfast for two, thermal baths and spa facilities. Treatments are extra.</p>
        <p>Restaurants</p>
        <p>Food is still seasonal and celebratory in Austria. May and June is Spargelzeit (asparagus time), June the season for Eierschwammerl.</p>
        <p>In Purbach we also dined at the posh Nicholauszeche, Bodenzeile 3, in the village, part of the Romantik chain. It was good, and cost only about $44 a person; (43-2683) 5514.</p>
        <p>Our last -- and excellent -- lunch was at Johann Reisner in Forchtenstein, Hauptstrasse 141, (43-2626) 63 139, where I took the $15.85 menu, and had Eierschwammerl soup, rabbit and a fantastic coffee-flavored  pot de creme with sour cherries.</p>
        <p>Our best meals in Hungary were at the Hotel Kastely, Nagycenk, and the HBH restaurant in Sarvar. At the hotel, I went Hungarian with bean soup and veal paprika, followed by cherry, cottage cheese, raisin and poppy-seed strudel ($4.90). The HBH is the restaurant of a revived private brewery with historic Bavarian links, and, as the singer swung into ''Blueberry Hill'' while we tucked into inexpensive, tasty platefuls of tender, lean meat and vegetables, we might never have left Munich.</p>
        <p>Maps</p>
        <p>Map aficionados like me will be tempted by the Austrian government's meticulous 1:50,000 series, which covers the Neusiedler See in four sheets, virtually recording every path, reedbed and ditch. You need No. 78 for Rust and Neusiedl, 108 for Deutschkreutz (including Sopron) and 109 for Pamhagen. They cost $2 to $5 each in bookstores.</p>
