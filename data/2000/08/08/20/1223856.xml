        <p>FIRST careers are made by chance, second careers by choice. At least that's the way it worked out for Sam Albert, a former I.B.M. executive turned radio broadcaster.</p>
        <p>For the last six years, Mr. Albert has been heard on the AM radio station 1010 WINS giving advice to the computer illiterate on topics like ''How to Keep a System Secure'' and ''What to Look for Before Buying a Computer.'' His segment, which he  writes and produces, is called CompuTips and is broadcast on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 7:55 a.m. and on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 5:25 p.m.</p>

        <p>FIRST careers are made by chance, second careers by choice. At least that's the way it worked out for Sam Albert, a former I.B.M. executive turned radio broadcaster.</p>
        <p>For the last six years, Mr. Albert has been heard on the AM radio station 1010 WINS giving advice to the computer illiterate on topics like ''How to Keep a System Secure'' and ''What to Look for Before Buying a Computer.'' His segment, which he  writes and produces, is called CompuTips and is broadcast on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 7:55 a.m. and on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 5:25 p.m.</p>
        <p>''I'm having a great time broadcasting,'' Mr. Albert, 67, said. ''I was recognized by a cab driver the other day. I got a kick out of that. When he heard my voice, he pulled over and asked me for my autograph.''</p>
        <p>During his 30-year career at International Business Machines, Mr. Albert was recognized for his marketing abilities. He devised an early version of the company's business partner program, involving outside software companies, lawyers, accountants and consultants in the computer services industry.</p>
        <p>Yet in 1989 when I.B.M. started cutting its work force and began offering some of its top executives a handsome severance package, Mr. Albert said he felt obliged to take it.</p>
        <p>''I never wanted to retire,'' he said. ''I'm a workaholic. I had trepidations, but frankly, the package, which included two years' salary, was too good to turn down.''</p>
        <p>But breaking the routine of 30 years caused him some anxiety.</p>
        <p>''It was a big adjustment,'' he said. ''I was too young and energetic to retire, which is a word I hate. So I set up a home office in my house in Scarsdale and like some of my former colleagues became a technology consultant. I work on a per diem basis for large companies, many of them Fortune 500.''</p>
        <p>One of the things he likes about consulting, compared with his former full-time job, is that he has the freedom to do what he longed to do for 50 years.</p>
        <p>''Go into radio,'' he said. ''I always wanted to be an announcer, but my folks didn't think much of my ambition, so I majored in math at American University in Washington, my hometown, but never really lost my ambitions. Walter Cronkite was my role model.''</p>
        <p>Along with classmates, Mr. Albert started the school's radio station, WAMU, and was the host of several campus radio shows. But after graduation he entered law school.</p>
        <p>Mr. Albert's law school career was interrupted by Army service.</p>
        <p>''I was drafted and sent to El Paso, Tex., where the Army had me analyzing the effects of atomic weapons,'' he said. ''To do the job, I was trained to use a huge vacuum tube I.B.M. computer as big as a room. So I learned computers. It was pure chance I had that experience. It landed me a job and a great career with I.B.M. I never went back to law school.''</p>
        <p>He looks back on his days at I.B.M. as the greatest training ground anywhere. ''I couldn't be successful now without my 30 years at I.B.M.''</p>
        <p>If Mr. Albert's melodious voice sounds familiar, it should be mentioned that he was the host of a radio show, giving tennis tips, on WFAS-AM (1230) and WFAS-FM (103.9) in the 70's but gave that up when the demands of his primary job increased.</p>
