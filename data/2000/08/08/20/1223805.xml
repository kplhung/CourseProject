        <p>THE PRASADA, at 65th Street and Central Park West, was built in 1907 as Central Park West was flowering as an apartment-house boulevard. Construction tarps have covered its curious, bare-looking top floor for months, and its expansive lobby was completely renovated last year, marking new chapters in the history of this unusual building.</p>
        <p>Just after 1900 the character of Central Park West was established as a street of apartment buildings rather than private houses. Against predictions, only a few row-house groups sprinkled the landscape -- millionaires had chosen Fifth Avenue and in a few cases Riverside Drive for their spreading mansions. In 1904 plans were filed for three tall apartment houses: the St. Urban at 89th Street, the Langham at 73rd Street and the Prasada at 65th Street.</p>
        <p>The developer Samuel B. Haines retained the architect Charles Romeyn, who designed the 12-story Prasada with typical turn-of-the-century ebullience, with Beaux-Arts detailing capped by a two-story-high mansard roof. (The origin of the name Prasada is not clear.) The four banded columns at the entrance make an impressive statement, but overall the result is tepid.</p>
        <p>On the inside the Prasada is organized around a central open court, illuminating three broad stained-glass skylights over the lobby -- designated the ''Palm Room'' on an early plan -- originally with a fountain facing the front doorway. The typical floors were divided into three apartments each of eight to 12 rooms, renting from $190 to $300 a month. They showed the typical quirks of apartment planning of the time. None of the bedrooms had private bathrooms, and many rooms had sinks set inside closets, presumably to reduce the load on sanitary facilities.</p>
        <p>Each apartment had a long hall -- visitors generally made a substantial trek past kitchens and bedrooms until they got to the entertaining rooms.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, the stair hall had three large windows giving natural air and light, and the layouts often introduced 45-degree angles and odd-shaped rooms that give an interest and charm which the later, more efficient planning of the 1920's could not rival.</p>
        <p>It is often said that the early apartment buildings primarily lured families away from the bother of private houses, but this is not consistent with a random sample of the Prasada's early tenants. Moses Stroock, founding partner of the law firm Stroock &amp; Stroock &amp; Lavan, moved to the Prasada from the small apartment building still standing at the southwest corner of 95th Street and Madison Avenue. Oscar J. Gude, often credited with introducing the first electric advertising signs in New York, moved from an apartment building on 55th Street near Broadway. Charles Fowles, an art dealer, moved to the Prasada from an 1880's apartment house at 63rd and Park.  Henry B. Harris, a prominent theater producer who owned the Hudson Theater on 44th Street near Broadway, moved with his wife, Irene, from a fairly new apartment building at 69th and Central Park West.</p>
        <p>In 1912, Harris was returning to the Prasada from Europe, traveling on the Titanic.  According to his wife's obituary in The New York Times in 1969, he died after persuading her to step in the last lifeboat to get off.  She took over her husband's responsibilities, becoming, according to the obituary, the first woman theatrical producer in New York. She died in 1969, and had been living at the Spencer Arms, at 69th and Broadway. She must have passed the Prasada many times over the years.</p>
        <p>Only three years after the Titanic disaster, Fowles was lost on the Lusitania -- he had moved to Harperley Hall, next door to the Prasada, in 1914, the year the Prasada was sold in foreclosure.</p>
        <p>In 1919 two investors, Walter Russell and Penrhyn Stanlaws, bought the Prasada.  They had been involved in developing the artists' studio buildings on West 67th Street, including the Hotel des Artistes, finished in 1917. They announced that they were going to gut the Prasada -- eliminating the long halls and other anachronisms, adding a swimming pool, gym and dining room and full housekeeping services -- and convert the building to a cooperative.</p>
        <p>Their architects, Starrett &amp; Van Vleck, replaced the elaborate two-story mansard with plain brick, but their interior work was much more limited: to judge from a later rental plan, they squeezed in more bathrooms and ripped out the sink-closets but made few other substantial changes.</p>
        <p>THE building was probably vacated anyway -- only a few of the tenants listed in directories before the renovation appear afterward. One new tenant was the writer Edna Ferber. She had been living in the old Majestic apartment hotel at 72nd Street and Central Park West, and said she was sick of the semitransient atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Julie Gilbert, Ferber's great-niece, wrote about her great-aunt in the 1978 book ''Ferber: Edna Ferber and Her Circle.'' Ms. Gilbert quoted one of Ferber's essays about moving to the Prasada: ''I'm never going to give up this wonderful place. Never. They'll have to wheel old 'Gamma Ferber' out when they tear the building down. The very nicest thing, though, is to have a mattress that you know no one else has ever slept on.''</p>
        <p>The high-strung Ferber had started as a reporter in Wisconsin, but emerged as a writing talent in the 1910's, usually with stories about independent women. While she was at the Prasada, she received the Pulitzer Prize for her 1924 novel, ''So Big,'' and wrote ''Showboat,'' which was produced on Broadway in 1927.</p>
        <p>Despite her prediction about staying until the Prasada was demolished, she moved in 1929 to the Lombardy, at 111 East 56th Street. It was another apartment hotel, although one where tenants supplied their own furniture.</p>
        <p>Sometime before the 1940's, the iron railings at each apartment window and the masonry balustrades at the fourth and 10th floors were stripped off, emphasizing the bare appearance of the facade.</p>
        <p>The exterior still looks dour, but last year the co-op renovated its lobby, which, with its semicircular loggia, looks impressive. Most of the original lobby -- including the fountain -- is gone, but the original stained-glass panels light a new Beaux-Arts-style mix of columns and cornices, and the new elevators have glass doors, as the originals did.  The new lobby was designed by the architects Ehrenkrantz Eckstut &amp; Kuhn.</p>
        <p>An engineering firm, JMA Consultants, is repairing the roof. Eugene Ferrera, the owner, says that the roof work includes a complete reconstruction of the parapet. But it's not because the parapet is a later alteration, done on the cheap -- between the 1907 building and the 1919 addition, Mr. Ferrara said, ''you can't see any difference.''</p>
