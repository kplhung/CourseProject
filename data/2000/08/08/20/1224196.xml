        <p>It's not the South or even South Jersey, but a tangy Southern pulled pork or pulled chicken barbecue sandwich can be found at a tiny storefront on Ocean Avenue in Belmar, across the street from the boardwalk. The pork or chicken for the sandwiches is aged for several hours in a barbecue sauce that tastes of smoke. The secret to the sandwiches, and to the tender barbecue ribs, is the touch of vinegar in the Carolina-style sauce, said owner Lou Bottone, who opened Island Wraps, Seafood and BBQ in Belmar and Wanna Eat on the Bradley Beach boardwalk this past spring. He aimed the luncheonette-style stores at beachgoers who want to pop off the sand and find good food at a reasonable price. And a barbecue sandwich or ribs with a side order of waffle fries for a total of $6 is just that. For those not into meat, grilled yellowfin tuna sandwiches or platters and salads are available, as are turkey and roast beef in tortilla wraps, and fried shrimp and shrimp cocktails, and a few desserts. For less than $10, a patron can get more than enough to eat and wash it down with a bottle of water. On weekends, Mr. Bottone also makes beef brisket, which takes about six hours to prepare; it's available in a sandwich or on a platter.</p>
        <p>KAREN DEMASTERS</p>
        <p>The stores, at 1203 Ocean Avenue in Belmar, (732) 681-8760, and at 211 Ocean Avenue in Bradley Beach (732) 988-1883, have limited seating at outside tables and sell food to take out. The stores are open daily from early March through October, from 9 a.m. until the customers stop coming, which is often 4 a.m. on weekends.</p>
