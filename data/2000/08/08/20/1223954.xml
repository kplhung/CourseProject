        <p>Grand Union Company, one of the largest food retailers in the Northeast, has laid off 170 people, most from its Wayne headquarters, in an effort to cut expenses associated with the 200-store supermarket chain. In the headquarters office, 100 of the 400 employees were laid off, said Sue Marsh, a company spokeswoman. Another 20 of the 70 administrative, maintenance and construction employees at the offices in Clifton Park, N.Y., were laid off as were 50 nonunion employees at the stores, where 13,000 people are employed. The struggling supermarket chain, which has stores in five Northeastern states, is working with financial advisors to devise a new financial plan. The layoffs, completed last week, are expected to save the company $8 million to $12 million a year. Sales were down 4.2 percent for the chain in the first fiscal quarter ending July 22, but showed some improvement in June and July, the company announced at the annual stockholders meeting Thursday.</p>
