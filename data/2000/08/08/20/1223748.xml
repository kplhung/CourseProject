        <p>This fall I want a new scent. The bright, clean fragrances, so fresh a few years ago, now feel thin, too pure. A new age of decadence has dawned and I want to be part of it. Don't speak to me about a signature scent -- wearing the same perfume my whole life. Let me dance to the music of time. And yet fragrance, more intimate than lingerie, must also express my inner core, awaken forgotten memories, call up a submerged aspect of self. How do I reconcile these apparently conflicting needs?</p>
        <p>First I consult the oracles at the Quest International Fragrances Company in Manhattan: the perfumers Calice Becker and Rodrigo Flores-Roux, and Paul Austin, the vice president of marketing and new-business development. To be right in the moment, Paul says, wear a big designer floral like J'adore from Dior. It's feminine but not heavy-handed. Calice, who created J'adore, says it is bright ''like a bell,'' yet sensual and tactile. Or choose Fragile, from Gaultier, suggests Paul. It's exuberant, with tuberose. If I want to be a little ahead of the trend, I can venture into some of the innovative, sensual blends of chypre (mossy, woody) and Oriental (rich, vanillalike), like Gucci Rush, Python from Trussardi or Mania from Armani.</p>

        <p>This fall I want a new scent. The bright, clean fragrances, so fresh a few years ago, now feel thin, too pure. A new age of decadence has dawned and I want to be part of it. Don't speak to me about a signature scent -- wearing the same perfume my whole life. Let me dance to the music of time. And yet fragrance, more intimate than lingerie, must also express my inner core, awaken forgotten memories, call up a submerged aspect of self. How do I reconcile these apparently conflicting needs?</p>
        <p>First I consult the oracles at the Quest International Fragrances Company in Manhattan: the perfumers Calice Becker and Rodrigo Flores-Roux, and Paul Austin, the vice president of marketing and new-business development. To be right in the moment, Paul says, wear a big designer floral like J'adore from Dior. It's feminine but not heavy-handed. Calice, who created J'adore, says it is bright ''like a bell,'' yet sensual and tactile. Or choose Fragile, from Gaultier, suggests Paul. It's exuberant, with tuberose. If I want to be a little ahead of the trend, I can venture into some of the innovative, sensual blends of chypre (mossy, woody) and Oriental (rich, vanillalike), like Gucci Rush, Python from Trussardi or Mania from Armani.</p>
        <p>Now, Paul brings out his chest of futuristic aromas: bread crust for comfort, and paint gallery to make one feel artistic. That reminds me of a daring new trend called layering, in which anyone can be the perfumer by mixing scents directly on the body. ''We hate that!'' cries Calice. ''That's like throwing bricks in the air and hoping they will come down as a house.'' Or, says Rodrigo, riffing on the thought of wearing Shalimar with Tommy Girl, ''like listening to Schubert and Guns n' Roses at the same time.'' Paul, ever the diplomat, says that layering can work when parts of one fragrance are applied separately, which can be done with Calvin Klein's new Truth.</p>
        <p>Whenever I go into Calvin Klein on Madison Avenue, I am instantly converted to Klein's minimalist aesthetic. Yet the clothes are displayed so immaculately that I'm afraid to touch them, let alone try them on. Truth, however, is not at all austere. It is a combination of two accords, or blends: lush, which is clean and green, and sensual, which is warm and woody. Also available are five separate essences of Truth: Bamboo, Citrus, Sapling, Lilac and Vanilla, to wear alone or in combination. I like the warmth that lingers after the fresh green burst. But what kind of seeker settles on the first truth she comes upon?</p>
        <p>I slip into the new Dior boutique around the corner on East 57th Street. Instantly I am reminded of all that is lighthearted and gay. I want to carry a little poodle named Fifi and kiss my friends on both cheeks. Shouldn't I have J'adore for when I'm dressing up for big events, or when I want to shock? J'adore on Saturday morning would be like wearing high heels with jeans.</p>
        <p>Lunch is next, beside the serene waters of the Four Seasons Restaurant, to discuss Shiseido's Zen -- a new scent, coming out in October -- with Debbie Diamond, the company's vice president of public relations. Debbie hands me a tester. Lighter than Truth Calvin Klein or J'adore, Shiseido's Zen smells of rose and bergamot. Underlying the florals are moss and bamboo, components of a Zen garden, as well as kyara wood, used as a calming incense in Japan and said by Shiseido researchers to promote alpha waves in the brain. Meditation also induces alpha waves, but I can never bring myself to sit still long enough. Maybe I need a bottle of Zen for days when I want to achieve inner peace.</p>
        <p>After lunch I feel a need to talk about layering with Jo Malone, who makes her own line of scents, to be worn together or alone. She receives me in a suite at the Carlyle Hotel. Jo, who is British, has golden hair and the dewy complexion that is compensation for living in a sun-deprived climate. She says she favors timeless scents over trendy ones and would never want a fragrance that entered a room before her or lingered after she left. She always wears more than one of her perfumes. As a base she has her personal blend, a clean sandalwood and cedar wood, coming to stores within a year. In summer she adds a spray of Grapefruit, or, for evening, Tuberose. For winter she warms her fragrance with Amber &amp; Lavender. Then she confesses: ''I usually end up wearing whatever I'm working on. All last year I wore room sprays. Now I'm experimenting with rosemaries and bitter coffee.'' Jo makes it sound so artful yet easy to layer fragrance that I hurry off to Bergdorf Goodman and come out with her Verbenas of Provence, French Lime Blossom and Vetyver.</p>
        <p>At this point the voice of reason is arguing for a turn toward home, but I still yearn for some note, some reminder of my childhood, like the musty basement smell from my grandparents' house in upstate New York. I hop the train to Astor Place and walk to Demeter Fragrances on Second Avenue, the home of antifragrance, where I find the two founding Christophers. Christopher Brosius, in a long blue military coat with silver buttons and silver sateen trousers, his hair pulled back in a ponytail, has the luminous countenance of a visionary. Christopher Gable, in a red cut-velvet jacket and blue velvet pinstriped pants, looks like a grown-up Tintin without the curl.</p>
        <p>Their small shop is lined with hundreds of fragrance choices found nowhere else. There is Tomato Seeds (perfect for getting rid of doggy odors in a room, they say), as well as ''attitude adjustment'' lotions called Never Happy, Jilted and Crabby.</p>
        <p>The Christophers ply me with Honeysuckle, Dust and Mildew, hoping to spark a Proustian recall. (There's also Madeleine, but Graham Cracker is closer to my childhood.) We can't find my grandparents' basement, but I leave with Funeral Home -- white flowers and wet Oriental carpet,'' Christopher Gable says -- not to wear but to sniff as a memento mori.</p>
        <p>At the MAC store in SoHo are three potions. Something in the one called Synthetic Nirvana speaks to me. It is wood, from a resinous, long-dead Southeast Asian tree, sold in the souks of Morocco as incense to commemorate births, marriages and deaths. It is spicy with a hint of turpentine. Here is the warmth I have been seeking, along with the trace of a memory that has vanished, leaving only its smell.</p>
        <p>Now, it truly is time to pack my plunder and head home. I have found not one fragrance, but many, and even layers I can add or subtract. It turns out that fashion and the inner me are not in opposition but in accord. The only note I have failed to find is that evocative combination of old cement, mold and strawberry-jam jars sealed with paraffin. Perhaps it waits in a scent of the future.</p>
