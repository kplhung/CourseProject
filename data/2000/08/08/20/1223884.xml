        <p>ALMOST any non-Orthodox Jew in the Five Towns can tell you about the boycott threats that their Orthodox brethren have made to shopkeepers who dare to open on the Sabbath.</p>
        <p>Some say the threats started 20 years ago with the initial growth of the modern Orthodox community, which observes the Sabbath closely but which also mixes freely with the modern world. Others say the intimidation of business owners didn't start until about five years ago, with the influx of more strictly Orthodox families who are a little more insular.</p>
        <p>But trying to find a shopkeeper who has actually been pressured to close on Saturdays by the Orthodox is like trying to find the alligator that swims in New York City's sewer system. Everyone's heard about it, but the evidence is lacking.</p>
        <p>''The stories about boycotts and threats are all apocryphal,'' said Jay Todtman, owner of Toddy's Appetizers, a deli that has been in the heart of Cedarhurst's downtown since 1946. ''Everyone wants to paint the Orthodox as this evil cancer that's infesting the Five Towns, but I've found nothing of the sort.''</p>
        <p>Toddy's began closing on Saturdays and came under strict kosher supervision back in 1987, but Mr. Todtman insists the decision had nothing to do with the Orthodox community. Instead, he said, it was because many of the non-Orthodox synagogues that Toddy's catered to had started using kosher caterers. ''We did it not to go after the Orthodox community, but we got it anyway,'' he said. Go figure.</p>
        <p>Still, the fact that the rumors have persisted is a clear sign of the misperceptions and mistrust that exists in the Five Towns, an area that has been a stronghold of Jewish suburbia for generations and that has more recently become an Orthodox destination of choice.</p>
        <p>A more tangible source of tension between the Orthodox and their more secular neighbors is the growing number of shtiebels, private houses that serve as synagogues. As the congregations grow and seek building permits to expand, the complaints about zoning and parking violations mount.</p>
        <p>For many of these Orthodox congregations, zoning appeals boards and the Nassau County Supreme Court have become familiar battlegrounds. The Orthodox go to these sites to fight for their constitutional right to worship. Their neighbors go to enforce the zoning ordinances underpinning a tranquil suburban life where the streets seem immune to large crowds and parking problems.</p>
        <p>In many cases, compromises have been made and congregations have continued to worship in their converted homes. But there are at least three active lawsuits connected to Orthodox synagogues or shtiebels, one in Cedarhurst and two in Lawrence.</p>
        <p>The Orthodox have, in many ways, come to define the Five Towns even though they only make up about 30 percent of the total population. Certain neighborhoods, particularly in Woodmere, Cedarhurst and Lawrence, have become almost exclusively Orthodox. Even though some neighbors might believe otherwise, the Orthodox have moved into these areas in large numbers not with any intent to conquer, but out of religious necessity, because they must be able to walk to a synagogue on the Sabbath. And the non-Orthodox families they have replaced haven't so much fled the Orthodox, who tend to be young professionals with large families, as they have aged out of their empty-nest homes.</p>
        <p>Many business owners say that while the growing Orthodox community has changed the complexion of Central Avenue, the shopping street that runs through Cedarhurst and Lawrence, it has also helped revive a once-sagging retail district. But there are those who long for the days when Central Avenue was not home to quite so many kosher food stores and Judaica shops and was more like the Rodeo Drive of Long Island, overflowing with boutiques and fancy dress shops.</p>
        <p>For years, the Orthodox of the Five Towns coexisted easily with the non-Orthodox because they were predominantly modern Orthodox Jews. Like Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, the Democratic vice presidential candidate, they studiously observed the Sabbath and kept kosher, but the men did not always wear yarmulkes and the women did not always cover their hair.</p>
        <p>But as more observant Orthodox families started moving in about 10 years ago, unease that sprouted from their different rituals began to surface, according to William B. Helmreich, a professor of sociology and Judaic studies at the City College of New York. ''The arrival in the Five Towns of so many Jews who are more right-wing Orthodox has exacerbated tensions,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The practices of the more observant Orthodox fall somewhere between those of modern Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox groups. They don't wear the characteristic long black coats and beards of the ultra-Orthodox, but the women tend to wear wigs and dress conservatively and the men always wear hats or skullcaps. Parts of Lawrence are known as ''black hat'' neighborhoods, Dr. Helmreich said.</p>
        <p>''In many ways, the stricter Orthodox are more allied with the Hasidim than with the modern Orthodox,'' he said. ''They believe in compromising with outside society only when necessary, whereas the modern Orthodox believe in compromising whenever possible.''</p>
        <p>Many non-Orthodox feel as though the very public practices of the Orthodox are an open rebuke of their choice not to be as religious. For example, if clusters of Orthodox leaving a Sabbath service happen to linger around the driveway of a non-Orthodox resident to chat, the non-Orthodox person may think he is being given a message not to drive, Dr. Helmreich said.</p>
        <p>Orthodox leaders, for their part, don't see what the fuss is all about.</p>
        <p>''Some of our traditions may be different,'' said Jacob Mordechai, president of the Sephardic Congregation of the Five Towns in Cedarhurst. ''But that doesn't mean better or worse, just different. If anything, we see one of the most beautiful coexistence of all levels of Orthodox, whether more or less Orthodox, we can visit one another's synagogues and feel very close to one another.''</p>
        <p>Many of the stricter Orthodox families moved to the Five Towns from neighborhoods in Brooklyn where kosher food stores and yeshivas were plentiful. And over the years, the same infrastructure has developed in the Five Towns.</p>
        <p>They have a choice of kosher supermarkets and delis, as well as kosher restaurants, pizza parlors and a kosher Dunkin' Donuts. Both the Hebrew Academy of Long Beach and the Hebrew Academy of the Five Towns and Rockaway have recently built new schools. The first Orthodox university in the area, Sh'or Yoshuv, is under construction in Lawrence. The Postal Service has even expanded its hours to accommodate the Orthodox, keeping its Lawrence office open on Sundays.</p>
        <p>Jerry Cohen, the owner of Trees Accessories and Handbags shop, which his father opened in Cedarhurst in 1946, said the downtown area had gone through booms and busts over the years. The five-block area, encompassing about 250 stores, rode high in the 1960's and 70's when it attracted shoppers from far and wide. But the advent of malls and shopping centers sent the downtown, like so many others across Long Island, into decline.</p>
        <p>The 1990's have seen a revival, with the opening of at least 12 major chain stores, including the Gap, Victoria's Secret and, most recently, an Omaha Steaks -- a non-kosher business that felt the Five Towns would be a strong market despite the heavy Orthodox influence.</p>
        <p>''The Orthodox community is one of the best things that has happened to us since we've been in business,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''It's given us a whole new audience, and the bonus for us is, it's one of the most affluent Orthodox communities in the country.''</p>
        <p>Ivan Greenberg, who runs the Davey Shop, a lingerie shop that has been in his family since 1946, said he became frustrated when people complain that the business district has changed. ''I say to them, 'Look in the mirror, haven't you changed?' '' he said. ''Why shouldn't the town change?''</p>
        <p>On Saturday the downtown may not bustle as much as it once did, because about a third of the stores are closed either in deference to the Orthodox or because they are owned by Orthodox, but Sundays often more than make up for that, Mr. Greenberg said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Cohen said the perception that the Five Towns have become predominantly Orthodox has hurt business. ''A lot of people just assume we're closed on Saturdays and they don't come out,'' he said. ''But there are a lot of misperceptions out there.''</p>
        <p>Mimi Bernstein, the owner of Mieka Ltd., a women's clothing shop that has been a staple along Central Avenue for 18 years, rankles a little at the talk that the Orthodox have forced stores to close on the Sabbath. ''That's a myth, an old wive's tale,'' she said. ''I'm open seven days a week and if anything, the Orthodox walk by on Saturdays and we smile and say 'Good Sabbath.' ''</p>
        <p>Relationships in residential neighborhoods are sometimes a little less cordial. Neighbors complain that even though the Orthodox do not drive on the Sabbath, parking problems arise when members drive to the synagogues for weekday services or when they drive to the synagogue before sundown on Friday and then leave the car parked on the street until after sundown on Saturday.</p>
        <p>In the Lawrence Bay Park subdivision, where neighbors tried unsuccessfully to stop Congregation Bais Medrash from building an extension on a home that had been converted to a synagogue, many of the neighbors say they feel intimidated by the Orthodox congregation.</p>
        <p>One homeowner who asked that she not be identified said that on one Sabbath, four Orthodox couples were walking side by side in the street as she drove toward home. ''Instead of walking behind one another when they saw me or moving to the curb, they stayed right in the middle of the street,'' she said. ''And they yelled at me when I finally honked at them. They didn't want me to drive, but you don't have to have this arrogance.''</p>
        <p>Despite the neighbors' opposition, Lawrence officials approved Bais Medrash's expansion plan, and an extension big enough to seat 122 members was completed in early 1999. The neighbors sued in state Supreme Court and a judge ruled in their favor last June, annulling the village's approval of the extension. But the congregation and village officials appealed, and are awaiting the higher court's opinion.</p>
        <p>Thomas Pantelis, the attorney for the synagogue, said the neighbors' negative perceptions of the congregation were based in misunderstanding. He said he is hopeful that Bais Medrash's right to worship where it wants ultimately will be upheld by the appeals court.</p>
        <p>''There's no reason why we can't strike a balance between the right of religious exercise versus the concerns of neighbors with respect to parking, traffic and quality of life issues,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In the case of Congregation Bais Yakov, which is also in Lawrence, a neighbor, Howard Legum, has sued the village for allowing the synagogue, which seats 105, to operate with only four parking spaces. Steven Legum, who represents his parents in the case, said that parking is not a problem on the Sabbath, but up to 20 cars are routinely parked along the streets near the synagogue each morning during daily services.</p>
        <p>''This is not a religious issue,'' Mr. Legum said, noting that his family has long been part of Congregation Beth Shalom, one of the oldest modern Orthodox synagogues in the Five Towns. ''We have had commercial operations closed down in the area for similar reasons.''</p>
        <p>He said he was appalled that the village would allow someone to build an addition on a personal residence to create a synagogue and then take the structure off of the tax rolls even though it is also still being used as a home. ''My personal opinion is that village officials are pandering to certain parts of the community when they let this kind of thing go on,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mayor Lawrence A. Blatte took exception to that charge. ''Pandering is an unattractive word and it's extremely unfair,'' he said. ''To the extent we have a large and growing Orthodox community with needs, we're trying to accommodate their needs.''</p>
        <p>Lawrence, like the other Five Towns, has gone through demographic changes, Mayor Blatte said, moving from a largely gentile population to a more Jewish one and now to Orthodox Jewish. ''We have always invited people to come into the community and we have always been successful in managing the change,'' he said. ''That's been the source of renewal for the village, and that won't change.''</p>
        <p>Cedarhurst, on the other hand, has been accused of the opposite, of unfairly trying to keep Orthodox shtiebels and synagogues out.</p>
        <p>The Sephardic Congregation of the Five Towns has sued the village, claiming that an ordinance that would require the synagogue to pay the village $180,000 to waive parking requirements is unconstitutional. The local law requires one parking spot for every four occupants and requires a fee of $5,000 for each waived parking spot to help the village create or improve public parking nearby. The 176-seat synagogue has provided a plan for 8 parking spots, but is required to have 44.</p>
        <p>''They call it a tax on religion, but we charge it to any commercial applicant,'' said Jerry Levenberg, village attorney for Cedarhurst. ''Like any community, the Orthodox are in most ways a positive element in the village, but some groups are more cooperative when it comes to opening these facilities than others and are more attuned to what secular law requires.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Levenberg said he understands the religious imperative that has prompted the growing number of shtiebels -- officials estimate about 10 have opened throughout the Five Towns in the last few years.</p>
        <p>''As a resident, what I don't understand is people have moved out here because of the aesthetics of the suburban village and yet they're bringing these very urban type of practices here,'' he said. ''Nobody is saying we don't want you here, we just want something reasonable for everyone.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mordechai, the synagogue's president, said the congregation had already modified its plans to meet the concerns of its neighbors. He maintained that the parking fee was unfair because parking is an issue only on rare occasions because the congregation is Orthodox and because the synagogue is a nonprofit organization.</p>
        <p>Samuel G. Freedman, a journalism professor at Columbia University whose book ''Jew vs. Jew'' will be published this month, said the shtiebel conflicts were ''a classic example of the culture of orthodoxy running headlong into suburban zoning laws.''</p>
        <p>Shtiebels have a long history in America, going back to prayer groups that met in Lower East Side tenement apartments at the turn of the century. ''In cities they existed without running afoul of zoning and building-code violations,'' Mr. Freedman said. ''But in the suburbs the sanctity of private property is a major part of life, so naturally they are an irritant.''</p>
        <p>But even as these individual cases work their way through the system, the Orthodox community in the Five Towns continues to grow and thrive. And that, Mr. Freedman said, in many ways defines the American experience of Jewry.</p>
        <p>''It's a sign that the modern Orthodox have made it economically in America, just like the non-Orthodox did a few generations before them,'' he said. ''That's really a barometer of American Jewry at large because the feeling a generation ago was that the Orthodox would wither away or they would just be the poor economic relations. Hardly any experts foresaw 25 years ago that they would make it to suburbia.''</p>
