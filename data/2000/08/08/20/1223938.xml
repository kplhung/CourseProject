        <p>IT may be difficult to imagine that any decade in American stock market history saw the magnitude or number of violent swings witnessed in the 1990's.</p>
        <p>Believe it or not, however, the market volatility of the last 10 years was no higher than the average of the last seven decades.

        <p>IT may be difficult to imagine that any decade in American stock market history saw the magnitude or number of violent swings witnessed in the 1990's.</p>
        <p>Believe it or not, however, the market volatility of the last 10 years was no higher than the average of the last seven decades. In fact, there was less volatility in the 1990's than in either of the two previous decades -- 21 percent less than the 1970's and 31 percent less than the 1980's.</p>
        <p>Those are among the more startling conclusions of a new stock volatility study by  Prof. John Campbell of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Martin Lettau, senior economist at the New York Federal Reserve Bank; Prof. Burton Malkiel of Princeton; and Prof. Yexiao Xu of the University of Texas at Dallas.</p>
        <p>Why, then, do the recent gyrations seem so severe? One possible explanation is in another of the researchers' findings: that even though the overall market may be no more volatile than in the past, the average stock is much more so. In fact, the volatility of the typical stock in the 1990's was about twice as high as in the early 1960's. That is because the correlation between individual stocks' gyrations has fallen -- in other words, more stocks are rising sharply at the same time that other stocks plunge.</p>
        <p>So on a day when an Internet retailer misses earnings expectations and immediately sheds a third of its market value, the stock of another company is skyrocketing because it has just reported unexpectedly good news. The extent of the volatility for any given company is indeed a modern phenomenon. But across the entire stock market of more than 7,000 companies, these gyrations largely cancel one another out, leaving the overall market no more volatile than it was in previous decades.</p>
        <p>This combination of higher volatility and reduced correlation has profound implications for how many stocks an investor needs in a portfolio in order to achieve adequate diversification. For years, statisticians have argued that a portfolio of about 20 stocks, in a variety of industries, is large enough to diversify away 90 percent of the volatility associated with owning a single stock. According to the new study, however, given that the average stock's volatility is twice as high as it was during the 1960's and 1970's, the number of stocks needed to achieve such diversification is now closer to 50.</p>
        <p>If your portfolio does not have that many stocks, chances are that you will have more sleepless nights and yet no greater returns to show for it, than you would with a larger portfolio. Your greater suffering will be in vain.</p>
        <p>That melancholy conclusion comes from the market's structure. In a stock market as efficient as ours, investors are for the most part rewarded only for taking unavoidable risks. But the volatility and risk associated with smaller portfolios are entirely avoidable -- and thus you shouldn't expect higher returns for incurring them.</p>
        <p>What accounts for the average stock's much-increased volatility? Answering with any certainty will require additional research, but the authors of the new study point to two contributing factors. The first is the trend over the last decade away from conglomerates and toward companies whose businesses are more focused. In a conglomerate, poor earnings from a single division have a relatively small impact on the price of the company's stock. If that division is spun off and becomes publicly traded on its own, a similarly poor earnings report will have a much greater impact.</p>
        <p>A RELATED factor is that a greater number of younger and smaller companies are publicly traded today. Because investors feel far less certain about the long-term prospects of these companies, their stock prices are much more sensitive to good or bad news than are those of larger, more established concerns.</p>
        <p>Regardless of the reasons, the wider gyrations of individual stocks teach a broad lesson: Diversification, which has always been an important way to gain immunity from volatility, is now more crucial than ever.</p>
