        <p>A Connecticut juvenile court judge ruled that Michael Skakel, a nephew of Ethel Kennedy, should stand trial for the 1975 killing of Martha Moxley, who was his 15-year-old next-door neighbor in Greenwich's gated Belle Haven enclave. The judge has yet to decide whether Mr. Skakel, who is now 39, should be tried as a juvenile or as an adult. Conviction by a judge in juvenile court could mean a sentence of less than four years; conviction by a jury in Superior Court could bring a life term.</p>
