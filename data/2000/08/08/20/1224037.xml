        <p>WHAT is it about the young indie actress Chloe Sevigny that has turned the fashion world into a pack of dogs howling about her as if she were a full moon, or a lamb chop? Is it that she's alternative? Not quite pretty? Is it that she wears vintage prairie dresses one day and Yves Saint Laurent the next and that at the same time she seems to care and not care about it? Could it be the odd dress by Alber Elbaz she wore to a New York City Ballet benefit last spring, or the fact that she pretended not to know who designed it when approached by a supplicating Andre Leon Talley, editor at large of Vogue?</p>
        <p>Are people clamoring for Chloe because she eschews being on magazine covers (why bother when The New Yorker already had Jay McInerney profile her as '' super-cool girl'' six years ago)? Is it because Gwyneth's too pretty and Courtney's too mean? Is it that the name Chloe Sevigny is exotic, or that until recently, as was well known, she lived with her mother in Darien, Conn., even as she took Downtown by storm?</p>

        <p>WHAT is it about the young indie actress Chloe Sevigny that has turned the fashion world into a pack of dogs howling about her as if she were a full moon, or a lamb chop? Is it that she's alternative? Not quite pretty? Is it that she wears vintage prairie dresses one day and Yves Saint Laurent the next and that at the same time she seems to care and not care about it? Could it be the odd dress by Alber Elbaz she wore to a New York City Ballet benefit last spring, or the fact that she pretended not to know who designed it when approached by a supplicating Andre Leon Talley, editor at large of Vogue?</p>
        <p>Are people clamoring for Chloe because she eschews being on magazine covers (why bother when The New Yorker already had Jay McInerney profile her as '' super-cool girl'' six years ago)? Is it because Gwyneth's too pretty and Courtney's too mean? Is it that the name Chloe Sevigny is exotic, or that until recently, as was well known, she lived with her mother in Darien, Conn., even as she took Downtown by storm?</p>
        <p>Is it because, after giving off nothing in ''Kids,'' her first movie, and in later ones like ''The Last Days of Disco,'' she surprisingly turned out to be a talented actress in ''Boys Don't Cry,'' as the backwoods girlfriend of a cross-dressing woman? Or is it because she has the nerve to say that she detests seeing her face on H&amp;M department store ads around town, but would rather make money that way than in bad movies?</p>
        <p>For whatever reason, the banquettes are alive with the sound of Chloe, recently labeled by Vogue as ''the New Postmodern Grunge Audrey Hepburn.'' Of course, fashion people are always fussing over this one or that one. It justifies using exclamation points for something other than shades of mascara. In 1964, it was Baby Jane Holzer, a mod young Park Avenue wife who acted in Andy Warhol movies and who did the Swim and was called ''the most contemporary girl I know'' by Diana Vreeland. Ten years later, according to Vanity Fair's new '' 'It' Parade'' issue, it was Ali McGraw, among others. Now, and despite the fact that Vanity Fair did not include Ms. Sevigny on its '' 'It' Parade'' list, she's It, the anti-actress, unfashionably fashionable, fresh, raw, unreachable. Being so adamantly anti-It only makes her It-ier, it seems. ''Born Free!'' sings the cover line next to her face from the latest issue of Interview. ''She refuses to be a puppet for the media,'' proclaims Ingrid Sischy, the editor in chief, in her introduction, adding that Ms. Sevigny and Harmony Korine, the writer of ''Kids'' (about teenage punks and a seducer with H.I.V.) and ''Gummo'' (about cat killers, among other things) are the Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton of our time.</p>
        <p>Everyone has something to say about her, it seems. ''She's like this skater kid who just fell into the right shoes and an Yves Saint Laurent dress,'' said Stefan Campbell, a stylist, who found Ms. Sevigny cute when she had the gumption to show up uninvited for a Vibe magazine skateboarding fashion shoot years ago. ''Designers and photographers love her because plain girls can make clothes come alive,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Anne Fahey, a publicist at Chanel  who's a fan, said: ''She was in the store a while ago to look at clothes for the Oscars and she had on this Hello Kitty-like underwear and I just thought that was so cool.'' Jorge Ramon, senior fashion editor of Teen People, added, ''She's an anticheerleader, which I love, and she makes wearing a beret look fresh.''</p>
        <p>A New York novelist I know calls her ''ugly-beautiful'' and extols her for escaping the unifying hands of stylists. An on-line editor, who said she can't decide if Ms. Sevigny is bright or not, but thinks she's a really nice person even though she has never met her, declared that we have a moral imperative to support her because of ''Boys Don't Cry,'' which earned her an Oscar nomination as best supporting actress. Another person admires her for sticking by the collections of Mr. Elbaz, the low-key designer who was deposed last spring by the hotshot Tom Ford at Yves Saint Laurent. Yet another lauded her virtue for understanding vintage fashion and for pushing Imitation of Christ, a friend's new clothing line. Michael Kors, meanwhile, has declared her a major muse and Nicolas Ghesquiere, another designer, who is revitalizing Balenciaga, calls her ''sophisticated and negligent and emblematic of the new generation of actresses.''</p>
        <p>And that's just a short list.</p>
        <p>''Once it was power that created high style,'' Tom Wolfe wrote about Baby Jane Holzer, who has moved on to become a bona fide has-been. ''But now high styles come from low places, from people who have no power, who slink away from it, in fact, who are marginal, who carve out worlds for themselves in nether depths, in tainted undergrounds.''</p>
        <p>From a skate-rat girl who worked in a vintage clothing store to an icon who allows the fashion world to congratulate itself for lining up behind someone who treats it with indifference, things haven't changed much in 35 years, it seems. At a moment when everything, no matter how contrived, is supposed to seem effortless, Chloe Sevigny's ''accidental'' rise to just-under-the-radar prominence is a lesson in how naive some ambitious people can be about actresses who seem to be without ambition.</p>
        <p>Those who have witnessed her climb more closely have a more nuanced view. ''There's something very natural about her,'' said Clifford Streit, a producer who worked with her in ''American Psycho,'' her latest film. ''But it's not an accident. She knows how to project an image on the public and make it appear effortless.''</p>
        <p>Lauren Zalaznick, the producer who cast Ms. Sevigny in ''Kids'' in 1994, observed: ''It's basically a full-time job making it into the world she's in. And no matter what she wants you to think, she's definitely working it hard.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Sevigny, who got her start in the business by working on the costumes for ''Kids,'' declined to be interviewed. Her publicist said she would like to disassociate from fashion right now.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Vogue and VH1 are planning their joint fashion awards show for October. Who do we think is on the top of every Vogue editor's list for the best personal style? ''Her aura has been hanging over every single meeting,'' said Ms. Zalaznick, who is the show's executive producer. ''It's this fascination with unfabulous fabulousness, and it's a little ridiculous. I mean, if it's about fashion why not just obsess over a model? Does it make these Vogue people feel more beautiful themselves for thinking she's so beautiful?''</p>
        <p>It's hard to say. All I know is that these days the Chloe watch never stops.</p>
        <p>The week before last, for instance, the possibility of her appearance either enhanced or sucked the air out of two parties, depending on your point of view. One, at the Rainbow Room for the director Whit Stillman's novel ''The Last Days of Disco, With Cocktails at Petrossian Afterwards'' was Chloe-free because she had Polish lessons for a new part. The other, a singles bash in Chelsea, featured Paul Sevigny, Chloe's commodities-trader-turned-celebrity-D.J. brother spinning CD's. Despite his rapid rise, not everybody loves his taste. ''Just for the hope of seeing his sister,'' said one disgruntled celebrity guest, ''we had to put up with his music.''</p>
        <p>All this will end one day. In the meantime, all hail the new dis-ingenue.</p>
