        <p>THE other day, a wild-eyed woman with a Doberman accosted me on a Brooklyn street.</p>
        <p>''Please! Do you have a spare Baggie?'' she asked breathlessly, as the thigh-high Doberman panted and slobbered.</p>
        <p>As a New Yorker, I've become hardened over the years to the sometimes whimsical requests of strangers. I've perfected that oblivious gaze into the middle distance that says, ''Nope, don't hear you.'' I've learned that innocent questions often mask malevolent intent.</p>
        <p>In spite of myself, this desperate woman moved me. It wasn't only the sincerity of her panic. The fact was, I'd been there: up a street without a Baggie. And the other inescapable truth was, I did have an extra one.</p>
        <p>Spare Baggies -- actually, I'm a Glad sandwich bag man myself -- are to dog owners what secondary chutes are to sky divers. As the designated walker of my daughter's year-and-a-half-old Maltese, Lucky, whom I affectionately refer to as ''the four-legged toilet,'' I am forever aware of the huge chasm between the possession of one Baggie and none. And so, by the way, are the supers of all the buildings in my neighborhood, who eye me as if I were a vandal when Lucky stops to sniff their stoop. Their challenging gazes relax at one gesture only: the producing of the Baggie.</p>
        <p>Curbside cleanup was never an attraction for me. In fact, I remember making a solemn promise to myself that among the myriad potential hardships of city life, I would never submit to the rigors of poop patrol. On this point, I call on the wisdom of Jerry Seinfeld, who once observed: If an alien race visited Earth and found that one species cleaned up the fecal matter of another's, which would they conclude was in charge?</p>
        <p>But then again, who knew from heartbreaking surrender to a daughter's dearest wish? Lucky arrived, and it was my world that was rocked. Suddenly I was thrown into a subculture I had only barely had to acknowledge, a kind of parallel universe of pet owners,  with its own rituals, its own rules of the road.</p>
        <p>I learned quickly that the city is divided into two camps when it comes to fraternization on the street. There are those who avoid eye contact at any cost. And then there are dogs. When you have a dog in New York, every day is Meet the Neighbors. You are required to have a personality at the peak hours of unsociability. Unshaven at 7 a.m., exhausted at midnight, you drag yourself, hair matted, cranky with morning mouth, along the pavement. Does the dog care? The dog couldn't care less. No, he's got to have his quality time with the Shetland collie around the corner that spins on its leash like a dervish every time you approach.</p>
        <p>''What's wrong with the dog?'' you ask the owner. ''He seems kind of, um, unhinged.''</p>
        <p>''It's a she. This is how she plays.''</p>
        <p>Uh huh. You tend to have lots of these sorts of conversations with people attached to poodles and Pomeranians who would otherwise melt into the faceless armies of extras of New York life. Instead, you stand there making kennel talk while your Maltese and his schnauzer work their way through the greeting ritual.</p>
        <p>''I had a schnauzer like him when I was growing up,'' you say. ''What's his name?''</p>
        <p>''It's a she.''</p>
        <p>Day in, day out, rain, wind, hail, humidity, there's no escaping outdoor bathroom duty. (We tried indoor wee-wee pads, but the dog was confused. One problem, we later learned, was that we had been placing the absorbent pads wrong side up.)</p>
        <p>Snooty, antisocial, keep-to-yourself walking proved too stigmatizing. Early on, I made the mistake of rebuffing the treat offered to Lucky by a woman with a great big hairy dog. I mumbled about dietary restrictions. She took great offense, and now when she sees Lucky and me, she theatrically tugs the big hairy thing's leash and drags him (her?) across the street.</p>
        <p>Other things I've learned as an urban canine sanitary worker:</p>
        <p>1. Do not be a middle-aged man walking a little white dog with a pink leash. Pink may be your daughter's favorite color, but trust me, there is more dignity in navy blue. After the third occasion in which a group of teenagers broke out into derisive giggles, an emergency trip to Petco was arranged.</p>
        <p>2. Do not encourage the predilection of humans of all sizes to squeal and stick their hands directly in a  dog's face. Why people do this is a mystery. What would be your reaction if a person unknown to you wiggled his fingers in front of your nose? Me, I'd probably bite him. I constantly warn strangers that Lucky does not distinguish between forefingers and chew toys.</p>
        <p>3. Do not be surprised at the things you do for love. Even pace the streets at ungodly hours, hands sheathed in Glad sandwich bags.</p>
