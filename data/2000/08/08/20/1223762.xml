        <p>AMERICANS who postponed vacations this summer hoping that airlines would announce major fare sales have had good reason to be disappointed: there haven't been any, at least nothing comparable to those a few years ago. And while most analysts attribute the paucity of summer discounts to continued high demand for flights, they note that the carriers' growing sophistication in knowing when to lower or raise fares on everything from individual flights to entire routes could spell the end to the periodic fire sales of years past.</p>
        <p>That forecasting ability was made possible by the computer application called yield management. Because of it, ''the airlines' skill at filling seats with targeted sales makes it unnecessary to offer across-the-board fare sales,'' said Terry Trippler, the air-fares expert at onetravel.com, a Web site for travel bargains. Besides, he added, Wall Street doesn't like such wholesale giveaways, which can result in lower revenues and depressed stock prices.</p>
        <p>Summarizing the airline industry's performance in the first quarter of this year, Raymond Neidl, director of equity research at Ing Barings, the investment bank, recently observed that ''the positive thing is that the ticket price increases seem to not have dampened travel.''</p>
        <p>That is also true of the second quarter of this year, as well as of last month. ''With most airlines reporting a much higher demand than last year, there is less incentive for the typical summer fare sales we usually see,'' said Sandra Hughes, vice president for travel-related services for the AAA.</p>
        <p>In fact, leisure air fares -- that is, discount fares that usually require advance purchases, off-peak flights and a Saturday night stay-over -- jumped almost 16 percent in June, according to the AAA monthly leisure travel index. While fares decreased 5 percent last month they were still almost 10 percent higher than in July 1999.</p>
        <p>Demand for flights is still so strong, that the three fare increases this year did little if anything to discourage Americans from flying. Most airlines carried record numbers of passengers in recent months, including Delta, which carried an all-time company record 32 million passengers in the three months ended June 30. In June, Northwest achieved a company record 82.8 percent load factor -- the percentage of available seats occupied by paying passengers -- and Continental's 80.4 percent load factor last month was its highest ever -- 0.4 percent higher than the record set this June and 2.6 points higher than July 1999.</p>
        <p>In fact, industrywide load factors, which have been in the high 70's most of this year and 80.2 percent in June, may eclipse the post-World War II record annual load factor of 70.1 percent set last year. (Between 1942 and 1945, when civilian flights were few, load factors ranged from 72.7 to 88 percent.)</p>
        <p>In Hawaii, where arrivals rose each month from February through May this year and the state appears headed for a record number of visitors, round-trip air fares have averaged $600 to $700 for seven-day-advance-purchase tickets between the West Coast and Honolulu, almost double the $300 to $400 in previous years.</p>
        <p>''Usually by this time you could figure on at least one or two fare sales,'' said Kana Leong, the owner of Pacific Island Travel, an agency that handles both corporate and individual travel, in Honolulu. ''But we haven't had any sales this year, because the planes are coming in and going out loaded.''</p>
        <p>The same is true on the mainland, where flights to popular tourist destinations are full and fare bargains rare. And even when there have been sales, they have been limited: on Aug. 1, T.W.A. announced a sale good for travel through Dec. 15 that included $398 round trips from New York to Los Angeles or San Francisco, but tickets had to be bought by Aug. 4.</p>
        <p>To be sure, there has been no shortage of other advertised fare sales this summer -- sales to call attention to new routes or additional flights on the same route, sales to stimulate traffic on routes, sales to off-season destinations and sales offering discounts of up to 10 percent for booking online. But most of these discounts were modest and followed fare hikes as well as the $30 surtax to cover increased fuel costs. Even heavily advertised ''discounted'' fares on one airline are often 25 percent or more higher than the regular fare on competing airlines flying the same route.</p>
        <p>As skilled as the airlines are at yield management, they seem to have had trouble figuring out the seasons this year -- at least summer, which most of the travel industry, including the nonprofit Travel Industry Association of America and the AAA, considers to be June, July, August and possibly the  few days until Labor Day.</p>
        <p>For example, while ''summer sales'' to such off-season destinations as the Caribbean advertised discounts of about 25 percent, most such sales were announced in mid-July and required a 14-day-advance purchase, thus greatly shortening summer. Delta's ''early summer sale'' to certain cities in Asia, Europe and Latin America was valid for travel only through June 15, meaning it ended before summer started.</p>
        <p>At another extreme, AirTran's mid-July ''Beat the Heat'' fare sale is good for travel through Dec. 15, because, the airline said, ''our customers don't want summer to end.''</p>
        <p>With crowded planes and higher fares it would be easy to conclude that passengers aren't interested in discounts. But as the Department of Transportation recently noted, after Sun Country Airlines started twice-daily discount service between Milwaukee and Minneapolis-St. Paul a year ago, fares on that route, dominated by Northwest, fell 55.4 percent (from $240 to $107) while passenger traffic rose 76.7 percent.</p>
