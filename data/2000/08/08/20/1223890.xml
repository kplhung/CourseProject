        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>While I applaud Gerald Marzorati's clear-eyed view of the ill-fated Altamont concert in December 1969 as not being the big-bang end of the Woodstock Nation [''Altamont: End, and Beginning,'' Aug. 13], I must take serious issue with his main contention: that the age of the rock spectacle was begun by the Rolling Stones. On the contrary, the Who had been blasting audiences aurally and visually for years and, in contrast to the Stones, had played at Monterey Pop and Woodstock, both before Altamont. In addition, they had been performing ''Tommy'' in concert halls.</p>
