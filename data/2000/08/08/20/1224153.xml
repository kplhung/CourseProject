        <p>After an auspicious start seven years ago, a program meant to help vocational students find jobs after graduation has fallen into complete disarray, according to an audit by the city comptroller.</p>
        <p>The program, called Project Pathways, was started in 1993 by the School Construction Authority as a way to funnel qualified students from the city's vocational high schools into apprenticeship programs in the construction trades. In its first years it was very successful, placing 98 percent of the students in apprenticeships within two years of graduation.</p>

        <p>After an auspicious start seven years ago, a program meant to help vocational students find jobs after graduation has fallen into complete disarray, according to an audit by the city comptroller.</p>
        <p>The program, called Project Pathways, was started in 1993 by the School Construction Authority as a way to funnel qualified students from the city's vocational high schools into apprenticeship programs in the construction trades. In its first years it was very successful, placing 98 percent of the students in apprenticeships within two years of graduation.</p>
        <p>But according to the report from Alan G. Hevesi, the city comptroller, the program was quickly derailed by mismanagement and lack of oversight by the construction authority, the agency in charge of building schools in the city. In 1998, only 38 percent of the students were placed in apprenticeship training after completing Project Pathways, and by early this year, only 3 percent of the students who graduated in 1999 had entered the apprenticeship training.</p>
        <p>''As a result of poor administration, a lack of monitoring, and the failure to ensure that all parties were adhering to their obligations, a program with a successful record for providing valuable opportunities for the students in the city's vocational high schools is being allowed to fail,'' said the report, which was completed on June 28.  ''This does a disservice to all the parties involved with the program, especially to the students who, in good faith, did what was expected of them in the program and expected help with placements in union apprenticeship programs.''</p>
        <p>The construction authority, which is one of several agencies involved in the program and has the primary responsibility for administering it, issued a statement Friday praising the program. The response disputed Mr. Hevesi's conclusions and said auditors had not fairly measured the success of the program, in part because they focused on the placement rate for graduates rather than on the number of students who eventually entered apprenticeship programs. The authority also said a moratorium on new apprenticeship programs issued by the State Labor Department reduced the number of placements, but the auditors said the decline had begun years before the moratorium.</p>
        <p>The scathing audit comes at a time of declining enrollment in the city's vocational high schools, even though construction industry representatives have loudly and repeatedly complained of shortages of trained workers.</p>
        <p>''Right now, the Board of Education is caught up in the move to higher academic standards, which is very important, but the trap is they forget about or neglect everything else,'' said Frank Carucci, vice president of the United Federation of Teachers for vocational and technical high schools.</p>
        <p>Board officials said the city schools intended to focus on vocational training, and said Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy had scheduled a meeting with construction industry representatives next month to discuss expanding the program.</p>
        <p>David Klasfeld, the deputy chancellor for operations, said Friday that the board intended to maintain a route to ''the industries in the city and to give kids the opportunity to get into these long-term, high-paying jobs.''</p>
        <p>Project Pathways has been only a small part of the vocational education program, and each year only a few hundred of the 25,000 students in the system were involved. Acceptance into the senior-year program, offered at 10 of the city's 18 vocational high schools, is based on grades, attendance and interest in the program. Students take a nine-week course to introduce them to the construction trades, and when they graduate are given an opportunity to enter an apprenticeship program.</p>
        <p>''Many students view the Project Pathways program as a door-opening opportunity for a career right out of high school that they might not otherwise have had,'' the audit said.</p>
        <p>According to the audit, principals complained about a lack of information for available positions and about long waiting lists for those available. One union official said the program started failing to work well after the first three years, the audit said. Another said he called the construction authority ''several times when he needed apprentices, and no one returned his calls,'' according to the audit.</p>
        <p>The audit specifically criticized the construction authority's record- keeping and its inability to match graduates with available apprenticeship slots. Auditors also reported long delays when they asked the authority to supply records for their review of the program.</p>
        <p>Project Pathways may soon be replaced. The authority and groups representing city builders and construction unions are working on a plan for a new program run by a nonprofit organization, Construction Skills 2000.</p>
        <p>Debra Perry, a spokeswoman for the construction authority, said the details of the new organization were being worked out by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the construction authority and the industry and union groups.</p>
        <p>Louis J. Coletti, chairman of the Building Trades Employers' Association, said the groups thought that a training program could be run more effectively by a nonprofit group than by the construction authority. Mr. Coletti said the original program lost its focus as the construction authority gave increasing emphasis to its primary task, building and repairing the city's schools. He gave the authority credit for pioneering the training effort, but said greater reliance on private industry could produce a better system.</p>
