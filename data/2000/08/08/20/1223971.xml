        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Peter Applebome's column on his hesitation to ask a black man to turn down his loud, X-rated rap music reminded me of a story. I was taking  tennis lessons, with a group of other white women and one black woman,  here in Maplewood. The tennis courts are next to the basketball courts, which are heavily used by older teenagers from Newark and Irvington. As we were lobbing tennis balls, they were lobbing obscenities to one another. They sounded and looked quite threatening. We white  women were trying to pretend this was not happening but the black woman was becoming more and more upset, particularly because her young son was sitting courtside.</p>
        <p>After a while, the African-American woman said, ''This has got to stop.'' She walked over to the basketball courts and said something very softly to the players indicating her son was sitting in earshot. Amazingly, these seemingly menacing guys were immediately extremely apologetic. They seemed completely unaware of how they sounded and after that never again uttered a profanity  the entire time we were there.</p>

        <p>As it turned out, the woman was a high school teacher in my daughter's very elite and predominantly white private school who soon became the dean of students there. While it may seem as though she was able to stop this behavior because of her color, I often have reflected on the incident and wondered if it wasn't more because she was a skilled teacher, didn't see these kids as threatening and knew how to speak to them in a way that wasn't confrontational.</p>
