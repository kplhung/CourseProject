        <p>Visitors to some of New Mexico's major tourist destinations can expect delays from highway construction.</p>
        <p>Work has begun on a two-year project to rebuild the intersection of Interstates 25 and 40 in Albuquerque. There will be lane closures and total shutdowns of the intersection at various times of day and night. The heaviest traffic is generally expected from 6 to 7 a.m. and 3 to 6 p.m.</p>
        <p>Visitors headed north, as from the Albuquerque airport to Santa Fe and Taos, can use city streets to bypass the construction zone and reach Interstate 25. Leaving the airport at Yale Boulevard, turn right on Gibson Boulevard and go to Carlisle Boulevard. Turn left onto Carlisle and go about four and a half miles. At Comanche Boulevard, turn left and follow it about a mile to I-25.</p>
        <p>To go west on I-40 from the airport, take Yale to Central Avenue, turn left, then right onto Rio Grande Boulevard.</p>
        <p>To check on specific conditions, call (877) 843-2444 or check the project's Web site at www.thebigi.com.</p>
        <p>Visitors going to Chaco Culture National Historical Park, northwest of Albuquerque, will encounter construction delays of 20 minutes to an hour on nearly 100 miles of State Road 44-550, between San Ysidro and the turnoff into Chaco Canyon at Nageezi. Construction continues for another 25 miles beyond the turnoff to communities where accommodations are available. For up-to-date information on these conditions, call the Route 44 Project's information number, (800) 543-4085.</p>
