        <p>COMMERCIAL enterprise springs from almost every tragedy, and the West Nile virus is no exception. Some of these ventures, however, seem a bit more dubious than others.</p>
        <p>The virus, which killed seven people last year and has sickened scores of others in the New York metropolitan region, is transmitted by mosquitoes, so it stands to reason that those who make a living killing them have benefited somewhat from the outbreak.</p>
        <p>Last summer New Yorkers, scrambling to ward off the illness, cornered the market on insect repellent. The city also made a hefty purchase of pesticides.</p>
        <p>Fair enough. The mosquitoes must be eliminated, thus someone must make a killing on the killing. But what can be said about Tire Conversion Technologies Inc.? Recently its public relations spokeswoman promoted the company as a possible West Nile eliminator because it converts old tires for use in a variety of products. The city and state have urged residents to get rid of discarded tires, which are a breeding ground for mosquitoes. With the help of Tire Conversion, its press  release said, ''the mosquito that causes the West Nile virus will have one less place to call home.''</p>
        <p>O.K., small nit. The company cannot actually use the tires lying about on residents' lawns and elsewhere, harboring mosquito larvae. In the near future, the tires would be collected first, said Nicole Stein, who wrote the release. The company's response ''is not a solution now,'' she said. ''I see it as a West Nile tangent.</p>
        <p>''It is going to help in the future,'' she added.</p>
        <p>But why the press release now? ''We saw that tires are in the media a lot,'' Ms. Stein said.</p>
        <p>Moving right along. Dirad Technologies operates the West Nile Information Line for New York City from its base in Albany. The line provides information about West Nile symptoms and transmission; the insecticides used; and the spraying schedule. New Yorkers can also call to report dead birds on their property.</p>
        <p>Dirad produces its own press release, with the apparent goal of drumming up more business around the state, and even the country. A sample: ''This exotic contagion has spread as far as Boston and will likely continue to grow . . .'' Edward Tierney, Dirad's general manager, said: ''I am hoping to get more municipalities using this. In Albany they use a live operator, and you call the guy and he is, like, 'Can you hold on a second?' This gives constituents answers in real time.''</p>
        <p>Others are simply flacking themselves. Dr. James Rahal, head of infectious diseases at New York Hospital Medical Center of Queens, sent out letters last spring saying he was available to chat with reporters about the virus. More recently, one public relations firm promoted Fordham University researchers who were saying that another mosquito, Aedes japonicus, might, just might, transmit West Nile, too.</p>
        <p>Interesting stuff, for sure, but maybe, just maybe, not for the front page. Not yet.</p>
        <p>Correction:  December 3, 2000, Sunday  An article in the Week in Review on Aug. 20 about public relations efforts to exploit the West Nile virus outbreak referred incorrectly to a letter about the availability of Dr. James J. Rahal, head of infectious diseases at New York Hospital Medical Center of Queens, to chat with reporters about the disease. He did not send the letter himself, though he says he was consulted; it was sent by a public relations firm representing the hospital.</p>
        <p>A letter from Dr. Rahal about the error was misdirected at The Times, resulting in the delay of this correction.</p>
