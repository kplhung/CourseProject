        <p>It is still true that everybody talks about the weather without doing anything about it, but these days it's more than just talk at the general store. The buzz is not about the cold spell we happen to be having but about ''weird weather,'' the kind that might pose a threat to the planet, not to mention the way we live our lives. Open the Bible to Revelation and place it next to the Weather Channel's Web site: you will find some striking similarities. The torrential rains pelting the South may not come mixed with blood and fire -- how would you like to see those icons on the evening news weather map? -- but the worst wildfires in half a century have scorched more than four million acres of Western forests, 80-mile-an-hour winds just knocked out the power for much of Kansas City, Mo., and, of course, here and there people are being struck by lightning.</p>

        <p>It is still true that everybody talks about the weather without doing anything about it, but these days it's more than just talk at the general store. The buzz is not about the cold spell we happen to be having but about ''weird weather,'' the kind that might pose a threat to the planet, not to mention the way we live our lives. Open the Bible to Revelation and place it next to the Weather Channel's Web site: you will find some striking similarities. The torrential rains pelting the South may not come mixed with blood and fire -- how would you like to see those icons on the evening news weather map? -- but the worst wildfires in half a century have scorched more than four million acres of Western forests, 80-mile-an-hour winds just knocked out the power for much of Kansas City, Mo., and, of course, here and there people are being struck by lightning.</p>
        <p>But why has weather moved to the front pages now? Are we stuck again in the dog days of summer news, or is the weather verifiably weirder than usual?</p>
        <p>All weather is weird. Every season has its extremes of droughts, blizzards, tornadoes and record highs and lows. It's the nature of weather to be random. Weather, particularly today's weirdness, is perhaps the most dependable way that chaos touches our daily lives. But the attention paid to weird weather these days hardly reflects some newfound appreciation for chaos and the role of the uncontrollable in our lives.</p>
        <p>On television, extreme weather has the same appeal as police pursuits. We seem to have an almost pornographic interest in meteorological catastrophes. Thus the popularity of amateur videos that graphically depict beachfront houses collapsing into raging surf (not a little Schadenfreude here) and tornadoes tearing trailer parks to shreds. Hollywood feeds this appetite with the likes of ''The Perfect Storm.'' Radical weather is not just a substitute for news. As a physical manifestation of chaos, it's all but the Platonic definition of news, a sequence of familiar but seemingly ungovernable events that threaten to affect every one of us.</p>
        <p>Some tend to interpret violent weather as punishment. The Zeus of lightning and the Thor of thunder are replaced by Nature herself just as theology is replaced by ecology. Destructive weather is a warning against our meddling with Nature, our obliviousness to her sensitivities. We are punished not for worshiping a golden calf but for having the hubris to build houses on the rims of canyons or on stilts in the middle of a hurricane alley. Weather as retribution may be a welcome point of view if it helps people make the leap from thinking about the weather to thinking about the climate, a broader picture that's even more alarming than that of whatever national forest just went up in flames. The icecap is melting and the Great Lakes are sinking. Lobsters are dying as their cold-water hangouts either start to warm or are polluted with pesticide runoff from all the mosquito spraying. El Nino and his sister continue to throw their destructive tantrums.</p>
        <p>In the end, it may be weather itself that provides the antidote to the excesses of ecological hand-wringing and catastrophe-gawking. When we pull back from the headlines and the comedy of errors that is weather forecasting, we can't escape weather as a daily metaphor for the unpredictable. Climate may stand for Classicism because it aims for stability by exalting the average, but weather, our daily milieu, is Romanticism because it embodies flux, change, instability. In terms of cultural temperament, our fascination with unusual weather shows that we postmoderns are really just unreconstructed romantics. Is it any surprise that the actual Romantic poets and painters shared our preoccupation with awe-inspiring extremes? Constable's fair-weather landscapes may delight, but Turner's storm paintings promise to lift us through terror into the sublime.</p>
        <p>These days all the talk about weather may reveal deeper anxieties about the future, especially as we stand in the doorway of an unknown millennium. Let's not forget that before there was weather forecasting, there was simply weather, arriving unannounced and usually unexpected. It was the envelope that moved around the earth even before our species rose to its feet. Weather is the natural background and soundtrack to our lives -- the accompaniment to our travel through the day. To be obsessed with weather as a manifestation of the earth's wrath or to reduce it to a matter of isobars and occlusions is to miss out. To be insensitive to the pleasures of its daily variations -- the texture of sky, the sensation of wind -- is to miss out, too. And as we spend more time trapped in the artificial environments of office and mall, we risk becoming divorced from the palpable drama of real weather. Hot or cold, serene or tempestuous, weather is the perfect analogue to our human moods, which must be why it is universally deployed as a trope in literature. Hence Robert Frost to the tree outside his window: ''That day she put our heads together,/Fate had her imagination about her,/Your head so much concerned with outer,/Mine with inner, weather.''</p>
