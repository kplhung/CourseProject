        <p>Regardless of its origin, the pay gap between the military and civilians that Ms. Williams refers to is real, and it must be closed. Current spending plans would not close the gap until 2026. That means that soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines and Coast Guardsmen volunteering to serve today would serve a full career before achieving pay equity with their civilian counterparts.</p>

        <p>There is no good reason in a time of unprecedented prosperity that the pay gap shouldn't be closed by 2006. As a retired general and a former chief of staff of the Army, I know that the quality of our armed forces starts with recruiting and retaining quality people. Paying them fairly is the least the next administration and the next three Congresses should do.</p>
