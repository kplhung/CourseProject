        <p>''If they want war, we will give them defeat,'' declared President Joseph Estrada not long ago in the latest version of his tough-guy political credo: ''Don't dare me.''</p>
        <p>He was speaking this time about Muslim rebels and, like his earlier turns at belligerence, this one worked. His poll numbers went up this week.</p>
        <p>The public is desperate for its president to pull himself together and start getting things done. A former movie actor with a lackadaisical approach to government, Mr. Estrada has increasingly become the subject of jokes, gossip and that old Philippine staple, coup rumors.</p>
        <p>Halfway into his six-year term, the economy is faltering, corruption and cronyism seem to be ascendant and Muslim separatists and kidnappers are getting out of hand in the southern Philippines.</p>
        <p>Now, with his options narrowed, Mr. Estrada has unleashed his army in a cathartic take-no-prisoners campaign against the rebels on the island of Mindanao. He is also determined to resolve a kidnapping of Western vacationers that has continued for almost four months on the tiny neighboring island of Jolo.</p>
        <p>Apparently as a result of the effort to end the hostage situation, those polled gave the president a positive rating of over 50 percent for the first time in months.</p>
        <p>But political commentators seemed unimpressed. Representative Raul Gonzales recalled the boost former President George Bush enjoyed after the Persian Gulf war in 1991 -- only to be undercut by his perceived failure to manage the economy.</p>
        <p>Even that comparison is on the rosy side, said Amando Doronila, a columnist for The Philippine Daily Inquirer. Mr. Bush had just won a war; Mr. Estrada does not even have a workable strategy for victory.</p>
        <p>Fighting has flared in the three-decade-old insurgency following his failure to build on the peacemaking and economic development policies of his predecessor, Fidel V. Ramos. Analysts here say there cannot be a lasting peace unless those policies are creatively pursued.</p>
        <p>A recent spate of bombings in Manila that many people attribute to the Muslim rebels heightened popular fears about the president's inaction. At least now, people say, Mr. Estrada is doing something. Last month, soldiers captured the headquarters in Mindanao of the main insurgent group, the Moro National Liberation Front, and Mr. Estrada traveled there to hoist the Philippine flag.</p>
        <p>''He's enjoying a sort of windfall from Mindanao, but that windfall is like opium,'' Mr. Doronila said. ''The opium deadens people's awareness to the really serious problems that are hurting them. They have temporarily forgotten the corruption and the economic issues.''</p>
        <p>The country's growth rate of less than 4 percent is well below projections, slower than the growth in most other nations in the region and far too low to absorb soaring birthrates. One-third of the population of 76 million remains below the poverty line and unemployment has risen to more than 13 percent.</p>
        <p>What is particularly damaging among investors is the atmosphere of old-style cronyism that surrounds Mr. Estrada's government, with favored friends receiving both political appointments and protection in questionable business deals. The World Bank recently estimated that corruption was costing the Philippines $46 million a year.</p>
        <p>Eschewing the hard work of making policy and legislation -- as a senator, he once said his favorite moment was when the speaker shouted, ''Recess!'' -- Mr. Estrada has fallen back on presidential decrees, issuing hundreds of them in his first two years.</p>
        <p>''His presidency is very erratic, not driven by any coherent vision or planning,'' Mr. Doronila said. ''It's very much an ad hoc presidency. But he has a sure touch for what is popular.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Estrada, a former B-movie actor who cultivates an image as a man of the people, is entranced by the example of Ronald Reagan, but the parallels go only so far. Unlike his American hero, he has little philosophy of government and is not leading the nation in any clear direction.</p>
        <p>And unlike Mr. Reagan, he is not a natural in the role of president.</p>
        <p>''One has the feeling that in reacting to a situation his first words are, 'How do I play this scene?' -- not whatever issues are there,'' said the Rev. John Carroll, an American sociologist who teaches here.</p>
        <p>But like Mr. Reagan, Mr. Estrada enjoys seeing the world in movie images. The persona he projects as president -- along with the public perception of him -- is based on his movie roles as a pugnacious little guy who faces down the slick and the powerful.</p>
        <p>Because of this image, his base of support is among the nation's poor. With most of the political and economic elite against him, he swept to office in May 1998 with a huge plurality of 40 percent in the field of nine.</p>
        <p>Now even the poor have begun to turn against him. Drivers of the gaudy converted Jeeps known as Jeepneys and used as public minibuses have said they no longer want him to use the Jeepney as his symbol.</p>
        <p>So he has promised a new President Estrada.</p>
        <p>''A nation's life is like a motion picture,'' he said last year. ''With proper direction, the next scenes will change.''</p>
        <p>The new scenes he has written look like this: he will get to work at 8 a.m. -- rather than in the afternoon -- and he will stay on the job all day long. He will set aside his beloved Johnnie Walker whiskey and drink red wine instead.</p>
        <p>And, he promised, he will curtail his ''midnight cabinet,'' all-night karaoke-bar-style sessions with his cronies that one aide said sometimes produced presidential decrees that had to be quickly countermanded in the light of day.</p>
        <p>''At 4 in the morning, I am the only sober one in the room,'' said the aide, Aprodocio Laquian, last March. He was promptly forced to resign.</p>

        <p>Hostage Release Breaks Down</p>
        <p>JOLO, Philippines, Aug. 19, (AP) --  Negotiators returned empty-handed today from an attempt to win the freedom of 25 hostages held by Muslim rebels in the southern Philippine jungle.</p>
        <p>''We have to come back another day and renegotiate,'' said Rajab Azzarouq, a former Libyan ambassador who is part of the negotiating team that traveled to the camp of the Abu Sayyaf rebels.</p>
        <p>Shaking his head and visibly tired and disappointed, Mr. Azzarouq said he would return when the rebels were ready to talk, but gave no time frame.</p>
        <p>Two vans that were to carry the hostages, some of whom have been held for almost four months, returned empty from the rebels' area on remote Jolo island, and military escorts and armored personnel carriers were withdrawn.</p>
        <p>The breakdown occurred when the guerrillas insisted on freeing the hostages in two batches for security reasons. President Estrada had ordered negotiators to win the release of all the hostages in a single group.  His order raised suspicion among the guerrillas that they would face a military attack soon after the release.</p>
        <p>The government's chief negotiator, Robert Aventajado, denied any such threat. He read a statement from the rebels saying that they had decided to free only two Europeans today. The negotiators refused the offer.</p>
        <p>Abu Sayyaf is the smaller of two major Muslim rebel groups that have been fighting to create an independent Islamic nation in the southern Philippines. The rebels abducted 21 people from a Malaysian diving resort on April 23 and later seized three French journalists and a dozen Filipino Christian evangelists who had visited the rebel camp to pray for the hostages.</p>
        <p>They have so far released nine Malaysians, a Filipino and a German woman, but continue to hold 25 hostages in primitive jungle huts.</p>
