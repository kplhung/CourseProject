        <p>To the Editor: Like Christopher Hall,  I was drawn to Leiden but for very different reasons: as an English teacher I wanted to see the town that Jonathan Swift cited as the city where Gulliver got his education in physick.</p>
        <p>After visiting all the tourist sites, my family and I were so impressed with its quiet beauty that for six summers we have made it our home base to explore the rest of the Netherlands. Leiden is never more than an hour or two from every fascinating nook and cranny of this particularly picturesque country. We also have our special favorites in Leiden, including the Haagse Schow restaurant, where you can eat enormous portions family-style.</p>
