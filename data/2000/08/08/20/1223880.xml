        <p>THE bird feeders at the Theodore Roosevelt Sanctuary in Oyster Bay are stocked and ready for the southward migration of scores of species over Long Island. But anticipation of exotic sightings has given way to trepidation about the possible effect that mosquito spraying to combat West Nile virus may have on the migrants.</p>
        <p>The virus is almost always fatal to crows and blue jays, whose deaths signal its presence and often lead to spraying. But less is known about what the spraying may do to other species and their food supply.</p>
        <p>''Tens of thousands if not millions of birds stream through on their way along the Atlantic flyway to wintering grounds,'' said Marilyn England, an ornithologist and the director of the Roosevelt sanctuary, which is owned and operated by the National Audubon Society. ''And we just don't know enough about the effects of using these powerful poisons.''</p>
        <p>With the Long Island mosquito season soon to peak (and expected to be abnormally heavy because of the cool, wet summer), ornithologists worry that the heightened risk of West Nile transmission will mean more extensive spraying. This could mean greater exposure to pesticides for the birds and the poisoning and partial eradication of a food supply, which for some species includes mosquitoes.</p>
        <p>''Insects are an important source of food that some of these birds depend on,'' said Dr. Michael F. Burger, an ornithologist and director of bird conservation for the Audubon Society of New York. Without sufficient food, he said, birds would lack the body fat they need. Some travel as far as South America.</p>
        <p>But other experts and officials say such fears are unfounded. ''Migrating birds generally go where the food is,'' said Dr. Nicholas Komar, a vertebrate ecologist for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. ''If they don't find food in one location, I would hope that they manage to move on to another.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Komar said spraying also protected birds susceptible to the virus by limiting their exposure to infected mosquitoes. The virus, not the spray, is the danger, they said. ''How many birds are dying from this virus?'' said Dr. Komar. ''I think it is a very large number.''</p>
        <p>Ward Stone, a wildlife pathologist for the state Department of Environmental Conservation, said the concern about spraying was misplaced. More alarming, he said, was mounting evidence that the virus posed a grave risk to a wide array of birds, including threatened species. Some worry about similar threats to bees and Monarch butterflies.</p>
        <p>''My big concern is that West Nile virus is killing huge numbers of birds, and the numbers are going to leap,'' he said. ''And it's very scary to think what this may mean for some bird species. The spraying is a tiny risk to birds compared to what West Nile is doing.''</p>
        <p>In addition to risks from spraying or infection, many experts say birds play a crucial role in spreading the virus and may have brought it to the New York area last year, when the current strain was first observed in the United States.</p>
        <p>Most birds develop immunities to the virus within days of infection and are no longer carriers. But crows and other members of the Corvidae family appear to be unable to develop sufficient immunity. Some raptors are also vulnerable, and Mr. Stone says the evidence of vulnerability of other birds is just emerging, and already a potential crisis.</p>
        <p>According to federal figures, confirmed bird deaths this year from West Nile totaled 188 in 34 counties in four northeastern states as of last week, including 128 in New York. Most were crows and blue jays. But Mr. Stone said confirmed bird deaths in New York were actually over 200 and rising rapidly.</p>
        <p>Officials in Nassau and Suffolk Counties said last week that they did not believe spraying could harm migratory or resident birds, or their non-mosquito food supply.</p>
        <p>''It's very unlikely because of the low concentrations and low toxicity,'' said Dominick Ninivaggi, the superintendent of the Suffolk County vector-control division in the Department of Public Works. ''I would certainly not try to maintain mosquitoes that pose a risk to people because of some possibility birds might need them as a food source. Our No. 1 priority remains human beings.''</p>
        <p>As of midweek, there had been no reported cases of human infection in Nassau or Suffolk. One death was reported in Nassau last year.</p>
        <p>Going beyond concerns about the effects on migrating birds, the Audubon Society has joined in questioning whether widespread spraying in the area had been an over-reaction and a health risk for humans.</p>
        <p>Frank Gill, Audubon's vice president for science, said spraying had been unnecessarily wide and had included federally protected salt marshes that were not breeding grounds for mosquitoes that were known carriers of the virus. ''The city and counties' sudden blanket spraying of the region is unwarranted by the facts,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The virus, first isolated in the West Nile District of Uganda in 1937, can cause death from encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain. The elderly and very young are most at risk, but county health officials have kept up a steady drum beat of advice that everyone take precautions, like wearing long sleeves, using repellents and staying indoors when mosquitoes are most active, in the early morning and at dusk.</p>
        <p>Ten infected birds have been collected in Nassau, the health department spokeswoman, Cynthia Brown, said, but no infected pools of mosquitoes have been found. Nassau has not sprayed this year.</p>
        <p>But in Suffolk, tests have confirmed 31 infected birds and 44 infected pools, and spraying has occurred in several areas. The county has also applied larvicides to wetland areas.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ninivaggi said the most intense viral activity in Suffolk had been in red-maple swamps, including an area near Belmont Lake in Babylon where infected mosquitoes were found. In aerial spraying, with synthetic pyrethroids or malathion, tiny droplets kill flying mosquitoes on contact. The target of is Culex pipiens, a species that breeds in fresh water with high levels of organic matter, like puddles and ditches, and in fresh-water wetlands.</p>
        <p>The virus has also been found in another mosquito, Aedes japonicus, and has been shown in tests to be transmissible to the type of salt-water wetland mosquitoes that abound in Long Island coastal areas.</p>
        <p>Ms. England, at the Roosevelt sanctuary, said she questioned the official assurances that current mosquito pesticides are safe for birds. ''They said DDT was safe too,'' she said. ''We really have to keep that in mind.''</p>
        <p>Ornithologists are far from alone in their concerns. Environmental groups, including Citizens Campaign for the Environment, say the risks of the pesticides to humans are far greater than officials concede.</p>
        <p>Lobstermen and conservation groups, including Fish Unlimited of Shelter Island, say pesticides washed from the mainland into coastal waters may explain the die-off of lobsters in Long Island Sound.</p>
