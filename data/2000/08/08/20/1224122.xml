        <p>IN the malapropisms of Bela Karolyi there is great wisdom.</p>
        <p>Take, for example, the remake of the classic movie ''The Magnificent Seven,'' now in ad hoc production at the Olympic gymnastics trials.</p>
        <p>For many people, there would be great sentimental value in the last three of the aforementioned Magnificents riding off into the sunset, or at very least flying around the world together to Sydney, Australia.</p>
        <p>Why not have Shannon Miller, Dominique Dawes and Amy Chow avenge the attrition that has claimed four of their fabled mates from the gold-medal class of 1996?</p>
        <p>College and normal life got Kerri Strug and Amanda Borden. Athletic old age brought down Jaycee Phelps this past week. Grinding bone against bone in her rapidly aging knee took out Dominique Moceanu. Why not let the survivors carry the banner into the new century?</p>
        <p>This is, after all, the quadrennial new age of women's gymnastics. The most attractive televised sport for women at the Summer Games is constantly reinventing itself. This is the year of the mature woman, with the minimum age now an advanced 16, by international mandate.</p>
        <p>Bela hates the rule.</p>
        <p>''This is stupidest thing,'' he bellowed Friday night. ''Is crazy discrimination. This has nothing to do with '96ers. They would have been here anyway. Is good. They make a living on tours. Good reason to come back. But what about all the little guys who are good enough to compete?''</p>
        <p>The old libertarian sees this as a discrimination issue. So what if some past gymnasts looked like the semifinals of the Miss Anorexia contest. Those little pixies could stay on that beam.</p>
        <p>Now the rules have changed. At the preliminary round for women held Friday night, there were ample signs of adulthood -- fuller physiques, even signs of 20-something maturity. Indeed, these grown-up-looking people are still agile after all these years. Dawes, 23, is a college student and an actress. Miller, 23, is a married college student. Chow, 22, is a biology major at Stanford with an eye toward becoming a pediatrician. And there they were, still vaulting and balancing and cartwheeling and swinging from the bars.</p>
        <p>What a lovely concept. The last three Magnificents. Chow finished the prelims in a solid third place, including the results of the nationals. Dawes remains seventh over all. And Miller, with no previous score because of an injury at the nationals, had the seventh best score Friday night.</p>
        <p>This is where Bela comes in. The coach, the old carrier of wounded athletes, was believed to have a soft spot in his heart for the warriors who won the gold in 1996.</p>
        <p>However, Bela did not survive in Romania without keeping his pragmatic eye on the prize. With his Carpathian I-am-the-walrus mustache now turning white, he prowled the sidelines Friday inspecting the new women and the old women, the relatively young and the relatively old.</p>
        <p>The temporary order is: Elise Ray, 18; Kristen Maloney, 19; Chow, 22; Jamie Dantscher, 18; Morgan White, 17; and Vanessa Atler, 18.</p>
        <p>Tonight, the committee will go into a room and choose six gymnasts, not bound to pick the six top finishers in these trials. Why then, you ask, call them trials? Look, Bela was not raised in a democracy.</p>
        <p>Bela was asked if he could imagine a scenario in which all three of the Magnificents would make this team. Couldn't he justify Chow as one of his four all-around competitors, and hope for some specialty work from Miller and Dawes? The old boy totally annihilated the concept of nostalgia.</p>
        <p>''Right now I say, the first six places are in very good shape,'' Bela said. ''If competition was today, I would be happy with order tonight.''</p>
        <p>That would leave two of his golden oldies out in the cold. Didn't it seem cold, putting two of his stars on notice that they had 48 hours to leapfrog over a bunch of people?</p>
        <p>''Let me tell you,'' Bela told everybody, ''48 hours can be great difference.''</p>
        <p>But could he -- Bela was asked again -- see any way that all three Magnificents would make this team?</p>
        <p>''Very unlikable,'' Bela pronounced.</p>
        <p>Unlikely? Somebody asked.</p>
        <p>''Yeah, yeah, unlikable,'' Bela replied.</p>
        <p>He meant unlikely, but unlikable worked, too.</p>
        <p>''There is split,'' he announced. ''A new generation. As tonight's performance showed.''</p>
        <p>Bela does have a sentimental side. However, it is usually expressed at medal ceremonies. And first he must get to the medal ceremonies.</p>
        <p>He has seen the movie. In his loose and highly flexible plot, only the strong survive. The script says nothing good about age.</p>
