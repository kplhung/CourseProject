        <p>William Safire (''Gore's Audible in Bishkek,'' column, Aug. 17) praises Al Gore for rejecting ''false machismo'' in deciding not to attempt a landing ''in befogged Almaty, Kazakhstan.'' This old reporter recalls a similar incident, with a different outcome, involving another vice president making a run for the top job.</p>
        <p>Forty years ago, Richard M. Nixon pledged to campaign in all 50 states and a few days before the election had made it to all but Wyoming and Alaska. On Nov. 4, 1960, he, his wife, Pat, his retinue and the reporters covering him, including me, a reporter for Time magazine, headed for Casper, Wyo., where a blizzard had cut visibility to zero. It seemed that Nixon might be forced to renege on his 50-state pledge.</p>

        <p>Forty years ago, Richard M. Nixon pledged to campaign in all 50 states and a few days before the election had made it to all but Wyoming and Alaska. On Nov. 4, 1960, he, his wife, Pat, his retinue and the reporters covering him, including me, a reporter for Time magazine, headed for Casper, Wyo., where a blizzard had cut visibility to zero. It seemed that Nixon might be forced to renege on his 50-state pledge.</p>
        <p>After a stomach-churning pass or two, we landed at Casper's socked-in airstrip. The vice president's staff scurried through the chartered Boeing 707, proclaiming that Nixon himself had given the order to land.</p>
        <p>False machismo? Indeed.</p>
