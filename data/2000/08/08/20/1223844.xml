        <p>GOOD fences make good neighbors, right?</p>
        <p>But suppose your neighbor puts his fence on your property?</p>
        <p>''This happens more frequently than most people think,'' said William Selsberg, a Stamford, Conn., real estate lawyer. ''That's why I always advise clients to get a new survey when they're buying property. The problem is that only about 40 percent of them take my advice.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Selsberg and other real estate lawyers say that any boundary-line dispute -- including those involving misplaced fences, sheds, shrubs, gardens, decks, pools, patios and driveways -- should be addressed promptly and if possible resolved before closing to avoid expensive, drawn-out backyard feuds.</p>
        <p>''If there's going to be a problem with a property line, I want to know about it before the closing takes place,'' Mr. Selsberg said.  ''The last thing a lawyer wants to do is represent someone in a closing and then have them end up in litigation five or 10 years down the road.''</p>
        <p>In most cases, he said, boundary-line problems can be readily identified if the buyer obtains a new survey of the property before the purchase. That is something many buyers are unwilling to do, because a survey can cost $800 to $1,500 or more. Unfortunately, Mr. Selsberg said, most lenders do not require a new survey as a condition of providing a mortgage. Instead, lenders will often accept an old survey if it is accompanied by an affidavit from the seller indicating that there have been no changes since the prior survey. The problem with that, Mr. Selsberg said, is that while sellers may make such representations honestly, they may not be making them accurately.</p>
        <p>''Most people believe they know where their boundary lines are,'' he said. ''But then the day comes when they want to sell the house, the new buyer gets a new survey, and they suddenly find out that their neighbor's vegetable garden has been on their property for the last 13 years.''</p>
        <p>Under ideal circumstances, Mr. Selsberg said, such problems can be resolved with little more than a neighborly chat. But what happens when there is bad blood between the two neighbors, or when the neighbor who originally planted the garden moved and sold the house to a new owner who now truly believes he is planting in dirt he owns? And what happens if, instead of a garden, the neighbor has erected a shed, a patio, a deck or even a pool?</p>
        <p>''That's when you end up in litigation,'' Mr. Selsberg said. ''I had a client in Westport who decided to clear some trees out of his backyard. Unfortunately, he cleared some trees out of his neighbor's yard, too.  We ended up settling the case for $20,000.''</p>
        <p>John G. Hall, a Staten Island real estate lawyer, said that in most cases the severity of a boundary-line encroachment -- the legal term used to describe one property owner's use of an adjoining owner's property -- depends on the degree of the encroachment.</p>
        <p>''Upstate, an encroachment of a foot or two may not be as serious as a six-inch encroachment in the suburbs,'' he said. ''But in Manhattan, an encroachment of an inch and a half could be a disaster.''</p>
        <p>A serious encroachment, Mr. Hall said, could render title to the property technically ''unmarketable.''</p>
        <p>That means that unless a prospective buyer agrees to buy the property ''subject to'' the encroachment, the buyer could decline to conclude the purchase unless the encroachment is removed. And that could be a problem if the encroaching property owner is not inclined to cooperate.</p>
        <p>Peter G. Brav, president of Good Deed Abstract, a title agency in Valley Stream, N.Y., said that it was prudent to resolve boundary-line issues even when an encroachment did not seem to bother either owner.</p>
        <p>''I had a friend who bought a house, didn't do a new survey, and found out only after he moved in that the fence he thought was on his property was really a foot and a half onto the property of the lady next door,'' Mr. Brav said. ''And although the lady didn't mind having his fence on her property, when she died and a builder bought the land, the builder quickly notified my friend that the fence had to go.''</p>
        <p>Another major property-line problem, Mr. Brav said, can occur when adjoining owners use the same driveway.</p>
        <p>''Most driveway easements are reciprocal agreements that are spelled out in both deeds,'' he said, explaining that a reciprocal easement occurs when each property owner grants the other the right to use part of his or her land. ''But in some cases, there's nothing in writing and nothing in the deeds, and that's where you get into trouble.''</p>
        <p>Accordingly, Mr. Brav said, if a person is buying property and it is clear that it will be necessary to use part of a neighbor's driveway to get to a garage or parking area, the purchaser should ensure that there is something in writing -- preferably in the deed to the property -- giving him the right to use the driveway. In fact, he said, even if there is an easement specified in the deed, the purchaser should try to determine whether there are any special conditions or agreements that govern the use of the neighbor's property.</p>
        <p>''There may be issues of maintenance or repair of the driveway that have been worked out between the former owner and the neighbor,'' he said. While such agreements may not affect title to the property, he said, they could have an impact on the relationship between the new neighbors.</p>
        <p>Another reason to have a survey conducted when buying property is to determine whether all of the improvements on the property being bought are legal, within the property lines and do not encroach on the neighbor's property.</p>
        <p>''You never know what a previous owner may have done with a property that could later cause problems,'' said William Trang, an engineer with the Staten Island surveying firm of Wohl &amp; O'Mara. Besides showing property lines, Mr. Trang noted, a survey also shows the location of pools, decks fences and anything else that has been added to the property.</p>
        <p>One common problem that purchasers encounter, he said, is buying a house with a deck built without the required permits. ''It's not only the size of the deck that's an issue,'' he said, ''but the height and location as well.''</p>
        <p>For example, Mr. Trang said, it is not uncommon for decks built without a permit to violate zoning code provisions that require the deck to be a certain distance away from the side and rear property lines.</p>
        <p>And while a new survey will not tell a prospective buyer whether an improvement like a deck is legal, it does give the buyer's lawyer the information he needs to obtain such a determination from the local building department.</p>
