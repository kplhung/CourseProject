        <p>THERE is a famous bit of publishing lore about how Tom Clancy's first novel, ''The Hunt for Red October,'' caught on in the mid-1980's.

        <p>THERE is a famous bit of publishing lore about how Tom Clancy's first novel, ''The Hunt for Red October,'' caught on in the mid-1980's. President Reagan read the tale of submarine disaster and derring-do and mentioned publicly that it was mesmerizing. The novel, published by the tiny Naval Institute Press, quickly became a runaway best seller.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reagan's instincts for pure and simple drama catapulted Mr. Clancy to fame. But they also help explain why the world has been so transfixed by the sinking of the Russian submarine Kursk in the Barents Sea and the desperate attempts to reach the 118 men either trapped or dead inside. At week's end rescue attempts were unsuccessful.</p>
        <p>Everyone knows that tales of sea adventure and calamity have always held deep appeal, and best sellers like ''The Perfect Storm'' and movies like ''Titanic,'' ''Das Boot'' and ''U-571'' have tapped into that fascination. But what is it about the sea -- and especially submarines -- that often makes the drama of those trapped below the waves resonate more than similar disasters on land, like mine cave-ins?</p>
        <p>Part of the answer is that for all the advances in science, the sea remains a mysterious -- and mystical -- force. Since the 1960's, every achievement in the space program has been covered so minutely by the news media that outer space has a familiar feel. But once you slip below the ocean's waves, you enter a dark, unpredictable and often claustrophobic world that, in some ways, rivals space as the final frontier.</p>
        <p>A frontier, but one so hauntingly close as to still feel a part of daily life. At just 350 feet down, the men stuck on the Kursk were tantalizingly near to safety last week, even as storms and rough seas frustrated rescue efforts. If the Washington monument were standing at that depth, only two-thirds of it would be under water.</p>
        <p>What also sticks so hard in many people's hearts is a sense of the courage and ingenuity of the men who volunteer to serve on what, as some like to point out in happier times, are the only ships that are actually designed to sink.</p>
        <p>Through frantic depth-charge scenes in World War II movies, many people are attracted to the strong, and enviable, bond that unites so many of these men when danger strikes. When the alarm bells ring on a submarine, ''You have to be able to rely on the first man who comes to the scene to do what needs to be done,'' said Carlisle A. H. Trost, a retired admiral and a former chief of naval operations.</p>
        <p>When he was a young submarine officer during the cold war, Admiral Trost and several of his mates were briefly overcome by gases while disengaging a torpedo that had suddenly begun to ignite. Partly as a result of the common risk of such accidents, he said, there also is ''a bond of camaraderie'' between American and Russian submariners, a sense of brotherhood, that always transcended the antagonisms between the countries.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the allure has been deepened by new revelations about this formerly secret world.</p>
        <p>Since the start of the cold war, the use of submarines for spying has been cloaked under the tightest secrecy. And it is only in the last few years that some of those exploits have surfaced.</p>
        <p>American submarines, for instance, have spent lots of time off Russian naval ports, waiting to intercept radio communications and check out the capabilities of each new class of Russian missile boats. The stakes were high. The goal of these submarines was nothing less than to avoid another Pearl Harbor, a surprise attack in the much deadlier age of nuclear weapons.</p>
        <p>To that end, the United States also sent a few specially equipped submarines into Soviet seas to dispatch divers, who tapped into underwater communications cables and retrieved pieces of Soviet test missiles.</p>
        <p>But despite all this heroism, it has only been at the time of accidents like the Kursk sinking that the public has had a chance to peer inside this hidden world.</p>
        <p>The American Navy lost two nuclear-powered submarines, the U.S.S. Thresher and the U.S.S. Scorpion, in the 1960's. The Scorpion sunk in an accident on the way home from the Mediterranean, and no one realized it in time to stop family members from waiting for her on a rainy dock in Norfolk, Va.</p>
        <p>The Russians have suffered far greater calamity, losing more than 500 men in submarine accidents over the last 40 years, according to the newspaper Izvestia. The loss of the Kursk is particularly poignant because many of the men were in their 20's and the submarine was not on a risky military adventure, but simply taking part in a training cruise. And the exercise, the largest in recent years, seems to have been held as much for political reasons as for tactical ones, in a forlorn bid to recapture some of the Russian Navy's former power and glory.</p>
        <p>Still, it is the image of men possibly huddled in the hull, banging for attention as the air turned foul and the sea churned through their sub, that will linger most.</p>
