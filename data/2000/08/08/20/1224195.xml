      <abstract>
        <p>Mount Kisco, NY, which celebrated its 100th anniversary of incorporation in 1975, plans to celebrate 150th anniversary of its founding with September 10 parade and other events on September 17; photo (By the Way column) (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>In Mount Kisco, it seems, there's always a reason to celebrate.</p>
        <p>In 1975, the village observed the 100th anniversary of its incorporation. Now, a mere 25 years later, it is preparing for its 150th anniversary celebration, which will feature a parade on Sept. 10, an interfaith service on Sept. 17, and a block party, youth day and dinner dance in the weeks that follow.</p>
        <p>But how can the 150th anniversary have sneaked up so soon after the 100th? It's because this event commemorates not the incorporation but the founding of the village, which grew up around the Harlem Railroad depot.</p>
        <p>At first, the depot bore the name New Castle, which didn't sit well. At a meeting of residents, one is reputed to have said: ''I live yonder beyond Kisco Mountain. When I drive down to the depot I always admire that noble hill. Could we do better than to call our railway station Mount Kisco?''</p>
        <p>The idea was quickly approved, the railroad agreed, and soon the village began to grow with the arrival of a woolen mill, a cotton mill, a grist mill and various factories.</p>
