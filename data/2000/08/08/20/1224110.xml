        <p>August usually produces a truce in Italian politics as party leaders head for the beaches along with everyone else. But with national elections looming next year, the center-right coalition leader, Silvio Berlusconi, fired an early strike this week, issuing the outline of a 25-point political platform from his vacation home in Bermuda.</p>
        <p>A crackdown on illegal immigration was one of the highlights of Mr. Berlusconi's Bermuda study session, and a signal that immigration, a relatively recent, but fast-rising, issue on the Italian agenda, will help define the battle between the ruling center-left coalition and its center-right opposition.</p>
        <p>The current government, led by Prime Minister Giuliano Amato, is keenly aware of how immigration is shaping up as a political bludgeon. That awareness was demonstrated on Aug. 16 when Interior Minister Enzo Bianco interrupted a day at the races in Siena, home to the famous Palio horse races, to discuss immigration issues with his German counterpart, Otto Schily.</p>
        <p>In Italy, the debate does not starkly pit those who oppose immigration against those who favor it. Many politicians agree that Italy, with one of the lowest birthrates in the industrialized world and one of the largest retirement age populations, needs to import workers, skilled and unskilled, to keep its economy going.</p>
        <p>The center-left government voices the same aim of curbing illegal immigration and favoring orderly, legal immigration as the right favors. Rather, the battle is being framed around election-year images and inchoate concerns that Italy's once homogenous culture is being transformed into an American-style multiethnic society.</p>
        <p>The current government, so badly divided that it has not yet agreed on a candidate for the elections, is painted by Mr. Berlusconi and others as ineffectual and infected by ''buonismo,'' an Italian word that suggests bleeding-heart liberalism. Center-left leaders in turn seek to portray Mr. Berlusconi as an intolerant xenophobe.</p>
        <p>Livia Turco, minister of social affairs, is getting ready to propose a new law to grant citizenship to immigrants and she advocates allowing immigrants' families to join them.  She has been heavily criticized by the right and has countered by accusing Mr. Berlusconi of lacking family values.</p>
        <p>Italy, which a generation ago was a country that exported immigrants, has become over the last few years one of the key entry points to western Europe for refugees from Albania, Turkey, Eastern Europe and also Africa and Asia.</p>
        <p>Every day, news shows and newspapers chronicle the desperate traffic in refugees who are smuggled along the Adriatic coast in crowded dinghies by criminal gangs. Every summer, some would-be immigrants die in their attempt to reach Italy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Berlusconi, a media tycoon who was prime minister for eight months in 1994, has long espoused a tough line on illegal immigration. His junior partner in his center-right coalition, Umberto Bossi, of the separatist Northern League, has often made xenophobic statements. Polls suggest that three out of four Italians say they believe that illegal aliens are responsible for a rise in crime.</p>
        <p>Mr. Berlusconi's latest proposal sounds draconian: he advocates that no immigrant be allowed to enter Italy until he or she secures a job and a work permit.</p>
        <p>Actually, Italian law already imposes that requirement, at least in theory. But tens of thousands of would-be immigrants sneak into Italy every year.</p>
        <p>From Jan. 1 to July 31, the police caught 16,097 would-be immigrants seeking to enter Italy by boat. In the same period, 37,210 illegal aliens were repatriated. Estimates of how many foreigners live in Italy illegally vary widely, from 70,000 to more than 250,000, and many experts suspect the numbers are far higher.</p>
        <p>And the law, which requires undocumented aliens to be expelled or repatriated, is unevenly applied. ''Policemen check my papers all the time, but they let me go,'' said a 30-year-old illegal alien from Ecuador, who insisted on the pseudonym Christian. ''They can tell I am here to work, not to cause trouble.''</p>
        <p>Italy has only about one million registered foreigners -- 2 percent of the population -- a far smaller percentage than in France, Germany or Great Britain.</p>
        <p>''Most of the fears expressed by politicians and opinion polls are irrational,'' said Mario Marazziti, director of the Community of Sant'Egidio, a Catholic charity that works with illegal aliens and the homeless. ''But the left is so weak right now that the right can use people's fears of crime and disorder to demonize the left. And that obscures the fact that business, which the right claims to champion, needs foreign workers to survive.''</p>
