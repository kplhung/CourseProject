        <p>John B Judis Op-Ed article on Al Gore's acceptance speech at Democratic convention, in which he defines difference between parties in strict populist terms; suggests that this appeal, harkening back to Franklin Roosevelt, can be effective even when people are doing well economically; adds that Pres Clinton's political achievement has been to revive perception that Democrats represent the people, Republicans the wealthy and special interests (M)</p>

        <p>Does a populist appeal have resonance in prosperous times? In his acceptance speech at the Democratic convention, Al Gore defined the difference between Republicans and Democrats in strict populist terms. ''They're for the powerful, we're for the people,'' he declared.</p>
        <p>This appeal, if updated, can be effective, even when people are doing well economically. One commentator compared Mr. Gore to William Jennings Bryan, the firebrand of 1896, but the proper comparison is with Franklin Roosevelt. Bryan's populism was the politics of an embattled minority, the last cry of Western small farmers.</p>

        <p>Does a populist appeal have resonance in prosperous times? In his acceptance speech at the Democratic convention, Al Gore defined the difference between Republicans and Democrats in strict populist terms. ''They're for the powerful, we're for the people,'' he declared.</p>
        <p>This appeal, if updated, can be effective, even when people are doing well economically. One commentator compared Mr. Gore to William Jennings Bryan, the firebrand of 1896, but the proper comparison is with Franklin Roosevelt. Bryan's populism was the politics of an embattled minority, the last cry of Western small farmers.</p>
        <p>In the 1930's, Roosevelt revived populism as a majority politics of the new urban working class. By identifying Democrats with the common man and Republicans with the ''economic royalists,'' Roosevelt and his successors controlled Congress for 44 of the next 48 years and won eight of 12 presidential elections.</p>
        <p>The constituency for Roosevelt's populism has not disappeared, but it became bitterly divided after 1964, largely as a result of civil rights struggles and the birth of the new left.</p>
        <p>Under Ronald Reagan, Republicans were able to create a new conservative majority by combining their well-to-do base with disenchanted white Democrats in the South and Midwest who blamed Democrats for their falling incomes and for rising crime rates.</p>
        <p>Bill Clinton's political achievement has been to revive the perception that Democrats represent the people while the Republicans represent special interests and the wealthy. Mr. Clinton did this by forcing Democrats to abandon the post-1960's attitude on crime and welfare that had turned off these swing voters in the first place.</p>
        <p>Al Gore now has an opportunity to build on what Mr. Clinton has achieved -- to restore in full the older populist majority, but not on exactly the same terms as Roosevelt did.</p>
        <p>America's ''common man'' has changed: he -- and she -- are more likely white-collar than blue-collar and more likely to live in suburbs than cities. And this populist majority, for the most part, doesn't want government expansion. These voters want to preserve existing social programs like Social Security and Medicare, and they want new, but modest, programs to help their families thrive in the new economy. But they are skeptical of large-scale programs that could lead to higher taxes.</p>
        <p>What they fear is that government will become more responsive to the powerful rather than to them -- a fear evidenced in the popularity of maverick politicians like Ross Perot and John McCain and in the continuing support for campaign finance reform. Mr. Gore seems to understand this. His acceptance speech was long on defending his own modest initiatives against the threat of ''big tobacco, big oil, the big polluters, the pharmaceutical companies, the H.M.O.'s.''</p>
        <p>His populism could also help where he needs it most, in energizing the Democratic base and attracting swing voters in battleground states of the Midwest.</p>
        <p>As Ruy Teixeira and Joel Rogers demonstrate in their book, ''America's Forgotten Majority,'' these swing voters don't live in Cleveland's upscale Shaker Heights, but in neighboring Lorain County. They are middle-income whites, most of whom have not graduated from college. Once Democrats, they backed Mr. Reagan in 1980 and 1984, but gravitated to Mr. Clinton and Mr. Perot in 1992 and 1996. They have proved responsive to a populism directed at special interests.</p>
        <p>For instance, in the Lorain County district now represented by the Democrat Sherrod Brown, Mr. Reagan won by 19 percent in 1984. But in 1992, Mr. Clinton won 38 percent of the vote; Mr. Bush, 35 percent; and Mr. Perot, 27 percent. In 1996, Mr. Clinton won 46 percent; Bob Dole, 39 percent; and Mr. Perot, 14 percent.</p>
        <p>It was because of the shift away from the G.O.P. among these voters that Mr. Clinton took Ohio and Michigan, as well as Missouri and Pennsylvania, in the last two elections.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore begins at a certain disadvantage with these voters, who may be put off by his sometimes aloof manner. But a populist approach could help him overcome his lack of personal appeal. He might not convince these voters that he is a more relaxed guy than his opponent, but if he can convince them that he is on their side and that Mr. Bush is not, he may well be the next president.</p>
