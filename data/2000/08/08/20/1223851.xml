        <p>SUE NICOLAOU drove through Eisenhower Park, turning left at the roadside coat of arms identifying the Carltun.</p>
        <p>A sales manager escorted Ms. Nicolaou through the sun-dappled, antique-filled ballroom. As Long Island district manager for Glaxo-Wellcome, the pharmaceutical giant, she books various restaurants for dinner meetings where she can introduce local physicians to her company's products.</p>
        <p>Ms. Nicolaou got the grand tour during her visit last fall: the Secret Dining Room carved out of the attic, replete with four marble-hearthed fireplaces; the cozy and smart Oyster Bar; the clubby Pool Room; the exclusive Wine Cellar; and finally the dark and masculine Havanas Room, haven for cigar smokers.</p>
        <p>A Gold Coast mansion relocated to Eisenhower Park? No, but that's the intended effect. Built in the mid-1950's, the property  has been leased to restaurateurs by the county for deacades.</p>
        <p>In 1995 the caterer John Tunney and a partner, Anthony Capetola, took the lease, committing $6 million to improvements. By the end of 1995 they opened a public restaurant, the Palm Court, while turning the rest of the 80,000-square-foot building into a Gatsbyesque backdrop for business and social events.</p>
        <p>Ms. Nicolaou decided that the Havanas Room, with its long mahogany bar and illuminated Portugese marble counter, was ideal for a small meeting she planned for July. ''Fine dining, exclusive setting, plenty of privacy,'' she said. She booked other rooms for other meetings, then returned to her office to write up invitations.</p>
        <p>The meetings were well attended, she said.</p>
        <p>''These are very sophisticated people in terms of dining requirements,'' she said of the doctors she invites for dinner and presentations. ''They have discretion over which events they attend. We want them to feel comfortable and at the same time experience the Wow! factor.''</p>
        <p>Until recently, the Wow! factor on the Long Island corporate meeting and gala scene was negligible. People like Ms. Nicolaou -- corporate events planners, meeting managers, gala directors -- faced limited menus, perfunctory service and decor that ran from drab to ostentatious.</p>
        <p>The emergence of a new wave of competitors has changed the rules of the game.</p>
        <p>Venues like the Carltun and the Vanderbilt, in Plainview, are introducing not only new menus but also new options in facilities and service.</p>
        <p>At the Carltun, the pony-tailed, 42-year-old Mr. Tunney finds inspiration in chefs like Emeril Lagasse and his camera-ready charisma; Mr. Tunney himself is a Food Network regular. He and Mr. Capetola, an attorney, have opened a second up-market restaurant in Atlantic City.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tunney got his professional start catering suburban bar mitzvahs at Temple Israel in Lawrence.</p>
        <p>''I saw many guests coming back week after week, and I realized I couldn't keep repeating myself,'' he said. ''Our business is like putting on a show, except we don't get rehearsals. I tell my staff, when people walk in the door, it's showtime.''</p>
        <p>A similar attitude prevails at the Vanderbilt, a glossy nightclub that dishes up its own brand of funky opulence. Owned by the Morey Organization, which also owns the rock stations WLIR and WXXP, the Vanderbilt is well known as a concert site. But according to Jed Morey, the 27-year-old who operates the place, catering accounts for 80 percent of revenues.</p>
        <p>Soon after the Morey Organization purchased the Vanderbilt in late 1998, young Mr. Morey scored a coup: GraphConnect, an organization linking five professional media associations, agreed to hold several meetings a year at the club.</p>
        <p>GraphConnect officials hoped to make professional networking less fragmented than in the past.</p>
        <p>''That choice made an enormous difference,'' said Ed Brennan, president of Erin/ Edwards Communications in Glen Head and co-chairman of GraphConnect. ''It used to be, everyone went to separate professional association meetings: P.R. people went to one hotel one night, advertising people to another a different night. You usually talked to the same people.</p>
        <p>''Now, several times a year, all the organizations meet the same night at the Vanderbilt. You attend your own trade meeting, then network afterwards with everyone else. The Vanderbilt is a quirky and eclectic place, a wonderful space for creative people to gather. And what a change from the usual rubber-chicken menu.''</p>
        <p>The arrangement exposed hundreds of media decision-makers to the site. Despite his tender years, Mr. Morey seemed particularly tuned in to the business needs of his growing clientele, as well as providing the entertainment infrastructure. ''I grew up in the broadcasting industry,'' he explains.</p>
        <p>His approach is different than the usual catering-hall pitch, clients say.</p>
        <p>''Usually, you end up talking price and terms when you book a room,'' said Sammy Ash, executive vice president of Sam Ash Music in Hicksville. ''Jed talks to you about synergy. He suggested a cross-promotion with his parent company. We thought it was a win-win situation, and we agreed.''</p>
        <p>The Vanderbilt has gained a following among presentation-conscious executives and planners that goes beyond such fields as advertising, media and entertainment. Many business people are delighted to have access to professional-quality stage and sound and light systems without traveling to Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Patricia Rosalbo, an event coordinator at Chase Bank, recently brought 200 people for an executive training session that featured a cocktail hour and dinner. Afterward, a corporate acting troupe came in with a presentation.</p>
        <p>''They delivered Off-Broadway quality, and that level of professionalism was very important to the bank,'' she said. ''As for the meal, that was outstanding. Until the Vanderbilt, this kind of meeting just wasn't possible.''</p>
        <p>Not everyone applauds the trend. A number of more veteran executives rue the emphasis on slick presentation and ever-more-elaborate menus.</p>
        <p>Willie B. Edlow Jr., chairman of the United Way of Long Island, attends his share of corporate functions and galas, and believes the traditional catering halls do their jobs well. The glitzier newcomers, with their expanded menus, require more waiters passing through more often, with frequent pauses to answer questions and take special requests. Such fussing distracts guests from focusing on the podium, he said.</p>
        <p>''We'll see if this trend lasts,'' Mr. Edlow said with a shrug.</p>
        <p>One who hopes it will is Michael Gonas, president of the New York Saints, the Bohemia-based professional indoor lacrosse team. Referring to the Carltun, he said: ''You're never rushed. The food is great. The service is great. When we want to recruit someone to the team, we bring them over to the Havanas Room, light up a few cigars and make our pitch. It always leaves a good impression on them.''</p>
        <p>''I'm telling you,'' he said. ''The place is a class act.''</p>
