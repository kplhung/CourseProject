        <p>IN 1983, fresh from the University of Florida with a finance degree, Dean E. McQuiddy went to work for Barnett Banks, then the state's largest bank, as an analyst recommending stocks to portfolio managers.

        <p>IN 1983, fresh from the University of Florida with a finance degree, Dean E. McQuiddy went to work for Barnett Banks, then the state's largest bank, as an analyst recommending stocks to portfolio managers. Soon, he helped create Barnett's Emerald Small Cap fund, and in 1994 took over management of the portfolio, consistently outperforming the benchmark Russell 2000 growth index through the end of 1997.</p>
        <p>But then Barnett, an old-line Florida bank, was swallowed in a wave of mergers. First, NationsBank of North Carolina took over Barnett, and Bank of America later merged with NationsBank.</p>
        <p>In 1997, Mr. McQuiddy and four key members of his Barnett team turned down offers of NationsBank jobs in Charlotte, N.C., deciding that it was time to take a risk by opening their own firm, Sawgrass Asset Management, in Jacksonville, the former home of Barnett. This summer, Sawgrass hit $1 billion under management, including the $162 million that Mr. McQuiddy manages in AmSouth Small Cap, a growth fund offered by AmSouth Bancorp in Birmingham, Ala.</p>
        <p>In his move from employee to investment entrepreneur, Mr. McQuiddy jettisoned most of his dark bankers' suits in favor of khakis and short-sleeved golf shirts. More significantly, he and his colleagues installed networked personal computers with a variety of professional investment programs to obtain real-time quotations and analysis. Back at Barnett Bank, when they had to wait their turn for the mainframe computer, it sometimes took days to get reports. The ability to upgrade technology without the struggle for budgetary approval has been liberating. ''We literally were able to leapfrog a couple of generations in technology,'' Mr. McQuiddy said.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. McQuiddy, 39, has five computer monitors glowing in his office, and reports cover his desk and spill over onto chairs and the floor. Technology is crucial to his quantitatively driven style. ''We spend a lot of time and effort and brain cells, tinkering with and improving our modeling system,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He started the fund in March 1998. After a slow start, it ranked 39th out of the 266 small-cap growth funds tracked by Lipper Inc. for the six months ended July 31 of this year, with a return of 15.27 percent, compared with an average of 4.36 percent for the group.</p>
        <p>From its inception until July 31, the fund had an annualized total return of 10.10 percent, compared with 27.82 percent for the group. Mr. McQuiddy's explanation for the turnabout is his criterion that a company must be profitable before he will invest in it. Last year, when stocks of money-losing technology companies were soaring, momentum players could chalk up gains with timely trades. But since the luster of the dot-coms has worn off, his conservative approach has proved sounder.</p>
        <p>Mr. McQuiddy, working with Patrick Riley and Martin LaPrade, who were also portfolio managers at Barnett, starts with the 1,400 growth-sector companies in the Russell 2000 and quickly weeds out any foreign or unprofitable concerns.</p>
        <p>Then they apply a series of models to measure companies on three key factors: earnings momentum, positive changes in analysts' estimates of future earnings and a value analysis. An exacting attention to upticks in analysts' estimates is a hallmark of Mr. McQuiddy's strategy.</p>
        <p>MR. McQUIDDY likes to buy stocks with price-to-earnings ratios of 30 to 40, but he has found high-earning bargains at lower multiples. Companies are ranked by ratios including price to earnings, price to book, price to sales and price to cash flow.</p>
        <p>The number-crunching typically turns up 150 to 200 stocks, of which 50 or 60 are selected. ''This is a consistent discipline that has worked for us over the years -- we don't stray from that,'' Mr. McQuiddy said from his office in Jacksonville's booming southern end.</p>
        <p>Then comes the personal touch. Mr. McQuiddy, Mr. Riley and Mr. LaPrade and other associates read analysts' reports, talk with analysts, interview company principals, look at the company's rivals and study profit margins. They focus on companies with high market share and an ability to defend it with patents, high budgets for research and development or unique technology -- all to find companies that are likely to post better-than-expected earnings that will send their stocks higher.</p>
        <p>The fund tends to hold a rising stock six to nine months; after that, it tends to get out. Turnover averages 150 percent a year. ''That sweet spot is the two or three quarters that the company does better than the street expects, and the market rewards the positive surprise,'' Mr. McQuiddy said.</p>
        <p>Just over half of the fund's holdings are in technology. Mr. McQuiddy likes profitable stocks that feed the backbone of the Internet, not flashy retail Web stocks. ''I like to use the analogy, and it's not original with me, that the people who made money in the gold rush weren't the people who mined for gold,'' he said. ''It was the people who supplied pickaxes, shovels and pans.''</p>
        <p>His behind-the-scenes Internet holdings include Hall, Kinion &amp; Associates, a staffing firm in San Francisco that specializes in engineers, systems analysts and programmers. Mr. McQuiddy bought the stock at $26.70 on May 15, and later added to his holdings, for an average cost of $30.31. It closed Friday at $39.25. The company's revenue has been growing 70 percent a year.</p>
        <p>He also likes Silicon Valley Bancshares in Santa Clara, Calif., the parent of Silicon Valley Bank, a lender to Internet start-ups. ''They take warrants for their services, and a lot of their clients have gone public or are in the pipeline to go public,'' Mr. McQuiddy said. Earnings this year will double, to $2.40 a share, he predicted. He bought the stock in April at an average cost of $33.90 a share. It closed Friday at $53.4375.</p>
        <p>Mr. McQuiddy doesn't turn his back on low-tech companies. In April, he bought shares of the Shaw Group, which fabricates piping primarily for electric generating plants, at an average of $41.31 a share. Shaw recently scooped up assets of a bankrupt peer operation and is expected to benefit from the proposed merger of the Entergy Corporation, a Louisiana utility, with the FPL Group of Florida. ''I don't think the market has yet focused on this,'' Mr. McQuiddy said. The stock, which closed Friday at $44.75, has been selling for less than 20 times analysts' expected earnings for next year.</p>
