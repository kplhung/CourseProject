        <p>During their unsettling summer, the Knicks watched Grant Hill ignore their welcome mat, failed to land free agents like Brian Grant and Danny Fortson and watched their competition get stronger. As a result, an organizational policy shift has taken place, with the team pursuing deals to trade Patrick Ewing, according to an Eastern Conference official.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Knicks officials would not comment on trade discussions. But they have entertained the idea of dealing Ewing before.</p>
        <p>In February, just before the trade deadline, there was a brief conversation between the Knicks and the Washington Wizards that involved Ewing. Ewing has a clause in his contract that gives him the right to refuse any trade, but the Wizards would once again be a likely candidate.</p>
        <p>As a Georgetown University hero, Ewing is beloved in Washington and would be received with open arms. He has never been granted such affection in his 15 seasons without a championship as a Knick, and he would probably be receptive to returning to Washington.</p>
        <p>''If they come to me with a deal, we'll talk about it then,'' Ewing said in an interview when the Wizards' trade speculation arose in February. ''Right now, all I can say is I'm playing for the Knicks.''</p>
        <p>Last year, there were heavy hints by Ewing that he could see himself ending his career in another location. While he was recovering from the partial tear in his Achilles' tendon early last season and feeling more unappreciated by the organization and his teammates, Ewing repeatedly mentioned Miami as a place he would like to play.</p>
        <p>Now Seattle has emerged as a potential site for Ewing to play out his career. Ewing has given the Knicks permission to shop him and has provided Knicks General Manager Scott Layden with a list of eight teams he would accept, The Daily News reported yesterday. Among them are the Wizards and the Seattle SuperSonics. The Daily News reported that a deal for the 28-year-old Sonics forward Vin Baker was being discussed. The Sonics would likely be the more attractive team for Ewing, considering that Seattle has the potential to be a playoff contender.</p>
        <p>But any deal for Ewing is made cumbersome by the $14 million salary he will make in the last year of his deal this coming season. The Wizards would be in the best position to take on his salary in an exchange that would send Juwan Howard or Rod Strickland to the Knicks.</p>
        <p>With Ewing at the end of his contract, the Wizards would have his cap space for next summer's free-agent crop. The only way for Michael Jordan, the Wizards' head of basketball operations, to use his cachet to woo name players and build a playoff team is with cap money. There is a catch, though. Ewing is believed to want a contract extension wherever he ends up. He has said he wants to play at least two or three more years, a scenario few teams would want to entertain for a 38-year-old. There could be a compromise, though.</p>
        <p>If Ewing plays out his deal in Washington, the common denominator between Jordan and Ewing -- the agent David Falk -- might be able to assure Ewing a position in the Wizards organization after he retires.</p>
        <p>Much of this is speculation, though. At the end of last season, an Eastern Conference official said trade scenarios concerning Ewing were in the works. But Layden was unwavering in his support of the beleaguered Ewing.</p>
        <p>At the time, the Knicks had just lost the Eastern Conference finals in six games to the Indiana Pacers. The two games the Knicks won in the four-of-seven-game series were the two games Ewing missed because of injury.</p>
        <p>A year earlier, the Knicks went to the National Basketball Association finals without Ewing. In June, just before Game 6 against Indiana, Latrell Sprewell was asked if the team played better without Ewing. His answer? ''The numbers don't lie.''</p>
        <p>On June 4, two days after the Knicks were eliminated in Game 6 with Ewing, Layden stood in the parking lot at SUNY-Purchase, the Knicks' practice facility, and said: ''I believe in order to get back to the finals, Patrick has to be part of the team. That's very important. I think Patrick is a critical part of the team. I appreciate what he does and what he brings night in and night out.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to get into anyone else. I mention that because I feel like, over the last while, he's been taking unfair criticism.''</p>
        <p>But two months later, after failing miserably to bolster their team with free agents, after watching Miami land Eddie Jones and all but complete a deal for Grant, the Knicks are in the mode to rethink their position on Ewing. And Ewing, after all the years of being blamed for every team failure, may be willing to acquiesce.</p>
        <p>In some ways, Dave Checketts, the Madison Square Garden president, foreshadowed such a potentially tumultuous end to Ewing's career with the Knicks. In March, Checketts discussed the future of Ewing with the team and whether No. 33 would retire as a Knick.</p>
        <p>''We say we can't embrace Patrick because either he won't embrace us or he's a private person,'' Checketts said. ''He doesn't let us in to what's happening or he hasn't won a championship. The fact is that whether he plays beyond his contract or not, Patrick will be one of the greatest to ever play in the N.B.A. and certainly one of the best to ever play for the Knicks.</p>
        <p>''I don't know how it will end. It's always tough. Was it time for Dan Marino? Was it time for John Elway? Was it time for Michael Jordan? When is a guy done physically? And when should he retire because he is at the pinnacle? You can ask all these questions, but it should be up to Patrick. And obviously, we'll have to play a role in that decision.''</p>
