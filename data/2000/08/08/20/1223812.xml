        <p>WHAT'S an election year without a moral panic? Popular music, and pop culture in general, are set up to be prime targets this year, stuck in the crossfire of a battle for the righteous high ground. Republicans and Democrats are both positioning themselves as guardians of what George W. Bush, in his speech accepting the Republican nomination, called ''essential values.''</p>
        <p>Al Gore, as everyone remembers, is married to Tipper Gore, a founder of the Parents' Music Resource Center, which pressured recording companies to place quasi-voluntary warning labels on potentially offensive albums. His vice-presidential choice, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, sponsored legislation to require labeling for recordings, movies and video games, with penalties for selling taboo material to children. (The bill was defeated.) Both major parties seem poised to offer cultural clean-up plans.</p>
        <p>When the moral-panic soundbites start to fly, artistic subtlety is the first casualty. Eminem, pop's current chief miscreant, has already drawn considerable flak for his second album, ''The Marshall Mathers LP.'' He deserves some of it; when he gets lazy, he defaults to homophobic slurs.</p>
        <p>Yet ''The Marshall Mathers LP'' is also an extended, twisted, hyperbolic diatribe about the gap between fantasy and reality, persona and personality, word and action. Eminem spends long stretches telling listeners not to like him, not to act like him and not to expect him to act like the wild man in his songs. ''Drug Ballad'' has an infamous line: ''You are now allowed to officially slap bitches.'' But it follows a description of ''you'' getting falling-down drunk; four lines later, still drunk, ''you'' drive your car to ''cause a 42-car pileup.'' It's pretty clear that the song describes idiotic behavior, but even simple irony is too complicated for a soundbite.</p>
        <p>The million-selling rap-metal band Slipknot, which dresses its members like clowns and ghouls and draws rabidly slam-dancing crowds, is just reaching the radar of the censorious with potential soundbites like ''How many times have you wanted to kill/ Everything and everyone.'' But the songs are blurted confessions of characters about to crack up or commit suicide; fans use them as an energy boost and hear them as much-needed company in adolescent misery. There's context beyond the mayhem, more than the parental-advisory label suggests.</p>
        <p>Of course, the busy pop marketplace has no lack of crass, pandering products. The moral panic is a fitting response to a grotesque cultural moment. Pop culture's governing intelligence seems to belong to a hormone-addled 15-year-old boy who can't tell whether he's horny or furious.</p>
        <p>In a perceptive story for The New York Times Magazine, RJ Smith described a confluence of rap-metal, wrestling and pornography in which rage and sexual confusion reinforce each other and women and gay men have become fair game. Add in morning-radio shock jocks, gladiatorial talk shows, ever cruder comedy acts, blood-spattered action movies and brutal video games, and the spectacle of heavy breathing backed by hair-trigger force is everywhere. Millions of people now happily entertain themselves with visions of gross-outs, punch-outs and shoot-outs. They're ready to rumble, even if they tell pollsters they're worried about other people's bad taste.</p>
        <p>Where did the testosterone frenzy come from? If pop culture is a barometer of unexpressed desires, then the angry white male, seen by pollsters as a major factor in 1990's elections, is still gaining ground. He misses his unquestioned power; he resents the gains of feminism and gay rights. In a rebellion against liberal tolerance, he's reasserting longtime rule over all the underdogs.</p>
        <p>But since tolerance has become the norm, he also insists that he has become an underdog himself. He wants to be as cool as any oppressed minority, even if his main source of oppression is girls who spurn his coarse advances. Slipknot, or the wrestler called the Rock (who spoke at the Republican convention), lets him share in a roar of defiance, or a headlock, applied to enemies real or imaginary.</p>
        <p>But pop culture is a cantankerous, polymorphous critter. It's just as likely, and perhaps more likely, to be a counterweight, providing feelings that people are missing in their daily lives. For the overwhelming majority of people who can distinguish between fact and fiction, culture can be an escape and a compensation, like psychological antimatter. Consider that some of the poorest nations -- Haiti, Congo -- produce some of the world's happiest-sounding music.</p>
        <p>Censorious types envision a monkey-see, monkey-do relationship between culture and its fans. Imitation and seepage can occur; on anecdotal evidence, it seems people are more likely to voice misogynistic or homophobic slurs now than they were a decade ago. Yet there's also a monkey-don't response: the video game satiates the mass-murder impulse. A piece of popular culture that touts its realism -- like recent gangsta rap -- may well be assuming an audience that's too far from the original scene to check authenticity, much less participate.</p>
        <p>So pop provides both chronicles of the moment and anthems of wishful thinking. During the late 1960's, when the United States was conducting the Vietnam War and bitter tensions divided the country, pop songs called for peace, unity and love. The great mid-1970's letdown -- Watergate, oil crisis, recession -- sent perky, hedonistic disco to the top of the charts. In 2000, the United States has peace, a humming economy and widespread quiescence; there's no visible enemy, just bland corporate power. And as a balance, pop culture is a thrashing, belligerent mess, where everyday frustration and aggression discharge in a jubilant symbolic rage. It's a strange equilibrium, and applying real-world values might have unintended consequences.</p>
