        <p>GIL PARRIS was trying to relax at home, but every five minutes or so the phone would ring. The word was obviously out that the 30-year-old guitar whiz was back here in town for a few days, so his friends, fellow band members and business associates were calling to say hello or schedule rehearsals and meetings.</p>
        <p>Indicative of how thoroughly occupied he has been this summer, a typical ''day off,'' meant for not much more than catching up on laundry, was packed with things to do. He was already late for a mixing session for his next album at a recording studio in Purchase. Plus, he needed to pack his instruments and gear for an evening gig in White Plains.</p>
        <p>Admitting that his musical activities are all-encompassing, Mr. Parris said he wondered what it would be like to have a job ''where I could leave at 5 p.m. and that would be it.''</p>
        <p>He concluded, ''Busy as I am, though, I wouldn't want to have it any other way right now.''</p>
        <p>It has been an eventful summer for Mr. Parris, even by his standards. Since June 1 he has been touring with the group Blood, Sweat and Tears throughout the United States.</p>
        <p>''I'm in between record deals, so I figured that hooking up with a well-known band like Blood, Sweat and Tears for a while would help keep my name out there,'' Mr. Parris said, adding with a chuckle, ''They also made me an offer I couldn't refuse.''</p>
        <p>Other endeavors keep him closer to home. The guitarist recently led his own quartet, the Gil Parris Band, at a show in his hometown's ''Gazebo Concert Series'' in Ashford Park. Next Saturday he will present his band again as one of the headliners at the fifth annual Sunnyside Jazz Festival in Tarrytown, sharing the bill with the saxophonist Sonny Fortune and the pianist Kenny Barron. (The festival continues next Sunday with a lineup that includes Chico Hamilton, Jimmy Heath and the South African trumpeter Hugh Masekela. The number to call for tickets is 914-631-1000.)</p>
        <p>On Thursday nights, as he has for the past several months, Mr. Parris directs a jazz jam session with the bassist Kip Sopho and the drummer Rudy Feinauer at Ernaccio's, 17 Main, a restaurant in Mount Kisco. It was during one of these sessions last spring that David Clayton-Thomas, the vocalist and leader of Blood, Sweat and Tears, scouted Mr. Parris as a replacement for the band's departing guitarist. ''Gil's a very talented player,'' Mr. Clayton-Thomas said. ''He fit right into the band the first night he played with us and made the guitar chair his own.''</p>
        <p>Born in New York City, Mr. Parris moved to Ardsley from Yonkers in 1977 when he was 8. The next year he began taking acoustic guitar lessons with a school friend, but his teacher, after noticing Mr. Parris's natural talent and rapid progress, split the duo apart.</p>
        <p>Neither of Mr. Parris's parents -- Mary, a speech pathologist, and Steven, a stage actor -- is musically inclined. ''We have no idea where Gil got his gift for playing the guitar,'' Mrs. Parris said.</p>
        <p>After graduating from Ardsley High School in 1986, Mr. Parris attended the  Berklee College of Music in Boston on a Jazz Masters Scholarship but stayed only one year. Mrs. Parris conceded she was ''a little worried'' when her son returned home with photocopies of lecture notes and said he would teach himself the school's jazz guitar curriculum. ''He sat in his room, and that's what he did,'' she said. The next summer he joined the band for the road production of ''Jesus Christ Superstar'' and toured Europe. A slew of gigs around New York City in blues bands and jazz settings awaited him on his return and soon afterward he earned a notice in Guitar Player magazine as a new six-string  sensation.</p>
        <p>A few years later, in 1993, the producer Joe Ferry decided to include Mr. Parris as part of a star-studded Syndicate of Soul recording he was making for Shanachie Records, ''Who Snakin' Who?''</p>
        <p>His debut CD, ''Gil Parris,'' was cut in late 1997 and early 1998 and released on RCA/Victor. It was masterminded by Michael Colina, a keyboardist and Bedford resident well regarded in jazz circles for his production work, and it featured contributions from a host of top stars, including the pianist Bob James and the saxophonist David Sanborn.</p>
        <p>Mr. Parris appears on his third Shanachie all-star gathering, the forthcoming ''Blues at Midnight,'' with a song he wrote, and he is looking for a deal to distribute a blues CD he recorded live at the Next Door cafe in Stamford in May. He has already started to outline songs and concepts with Mr. Colina for his next jazz album. One thing music fans aren't likely to hear from Mr. Parris  anytime soon is singing. ''There's too many people it comes naturally to, and I'm not one of them,'' he said with a laugh.</p>
