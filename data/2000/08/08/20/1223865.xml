        <p>WHEN Waterbury's Mayor, Philip A. Giordano, announced earlier this year that he would run against Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, state Republican party leaders and Gov. John G. Rowland tried to talk him out of it.</p>
        <p>They advised Mr. Giordano that Mr. Lieberman was a formidable foe for an obscure mayor of a moderate-sized Connecticut city who had no hope of raising anything close to the millions that were already in the Senator's campaign chest.</p>
        <p>But in Connecticut there was no one else willing to take on Mr. Lieberman, a two-term incumbent with a 74 percent approval rating in most polls and a reputation as a centrist Democrat with a moderate image that had attracted Republican and independent voters.</p>
        <p>And that was before Vice President Al Gore picked Mr. Lieberman as his running mate for the November presidential election.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Lieberman was suddenly thrust into the national spotlight, so was his little-known opponent in the Senate race. Mr. Giordano gained prime media coverage and at the same time picked up an obvious campaign issue -- why is Mr. Lieberman running for both vice president and re-election to the Senate at the same time? And what kind of message does that send to Connecticut voters?</p>
        <p>''I'll tell you what kind of message it sends: by running in both races he's making Connecticut a consolation prize and telling voters how little confidence he has in the Gore-Lieberman ticket,'' said Mr. Giordano, a 37-year-old lawyer serving his third two-year term as mayor of Waterbury, a city of 104,000 that is the fourth largest in the state.</p>
        <p>Describing himself as a ''true conservative'' driven to win a race he is still told is not winnable, Mr. Giordano said, ''I love the state of Connecticut and would never use it as a consolation prize the way Mr. Lieberman is in this race.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giordano, who was born in Caracas, Venezuela, came to the United States with his family at the age of 5. He grew up in Waterbury, attended the city's schools and, after spending four years in the Marine Corps, graduated from the University of Connecticut with a degree in political science and history.</p>
        <p>After earning a law degree at the Thomas M. Cooley Law School in Michigan, Mr. Giordano returned to Waterbury where he worked as a legal assistant for the corporation counsel's office in the early 90's, and was soon promoted to assistant to the corporation counsel. He also opened his own law practice in 1992.</p>
        <p>In January 1995 Mr. Giordano was elected as state representative from the 71st General Assembly District and shortly afterward, at the age of 32, was elected mayor of Waterbury. He has been twice re-elected since then.</p>
        <p>Before the two-race issue landed in his lap, Mr. Giordano concentrated on trying to make the case that Mr. Lieberman was much more liberal than voters had been led to believe.</p>
        <p>''For 12 years he has gone unchallenged, and we want to expose his liberal voting record for what it truly is,'' said Mr. Giordano. ''He can't go around saying he's a moderate and against things like partial-birth abortions and then vote against a bill that would ban them.''</p>
        <p>Dan Gerstein, communications director for Mr. Lieberman, dismissed Mr. Giordano's comments as ''pure hogwash.'' ''When you're 55 points behind in the race I guess you having nothing left but meaningless personal attacks,'' said Mr. Gerstein.</p>
        <p>Addressing the question of why Mr. Lieberman was running two races, Mr. Gerstein said: ''To withdraw from the Senate race at this late juncture would create tremendous chaos in the party and lead to an un-democratic democratic process of selecting another candidate. We believe very much that the Gore-Lieberman ticket will win in November, and then a special election can be scheduled for selection of a permanent replacement in the Senate.''</p>
        <p>The State Attorney General, Richard Blumenthal, has ruled that under Connecticut law candidates can run for both vice president and the United States Senate, just as two former Texas senators did while running for vice president -- Lyndon B. Johnson in 1960 and Lloyd Bentsen in 1988.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Lieberman would not be allowed to serve in both capacities. If he is elected vice president, Governor Rowland, a Republican, would be able to appoint a member of his party temporarily to the vacant Senate seat until a special election could be held.</p>
        <p>Governor Rowland has refused to speculate on who he would appoint to replace Mr. Lieberman, insisting it will be a ''non-issue'' because he expects George W. Bush to win the November election.</p>
        <p>Governor Rowland's press secretary, Dean Pagani, said that while the Governor was initially skeptical about Mr. Giordano's bid to unseat Mr. Lieberman, ''he now fully supports him'' and has made appearances with him around the state.</p>
        <p>While it is unclear whether a special election could be scheduled early in 2001 in the event Mr. Lieberman is elected vice president, the Secretary of State, Susan Bysiewicz, has indicated that the state's Democratic controlled legislature could pass a bill to allow a special United States Senate election in November 2001.</p>
        <p>Connecticut Democratic party leaders, including the state chairman, Edward L. Marcus, and Senator Christopher J. Dodd, have encouraged Mr. Lieberman to run in both races for two reasons: if he and Mr. Gore lose he obviously still provides the Democrats their best chance at retaining the Senate seat, and if he wins he gives his party more time to find a suitable candidate.</p>
        <p>''None of us can say with absolute certainty what's going to happen in 12 weeks,'' Mr. Dodd recently told The Hartford Courant. ''And I think the people of Connecticut would like to have the option of having Joe as their senator if the ticket doesn't prevail, and would be thrilled if he were elected vice president and had to then choose another candidate for the Senate.'</p>
        <p>That view is not shared by Mr. Giordano and his staff, who are nonetheless happy to take advantage of an issue they believe they can use relentlessly throughout a campaign they insist they can win.</p>
        <p>''I think the voters of Connecticut would prefer to have Mr. Lieberman here at home defending his record of flip-flopping and trying to pass himself off as a moderate while his voting record is clearly liberal,'' said Mr. Giordano's campaign manager, Tim Longino. ''He can't be running around the country telling people he's a moderate while voting for the country's largest tax increase ever in 1993 that included a gas tax that is coming back to haunt us now.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giordano said another key campaign issue would that while Connecticut ranks first out of the 50 states in providing per capita tax revenue to Washington, it is last in what it receives in federal dollars.</p>
        <p>''I think as one of the Connecticut's United States senators, serving for 12 years now, that Mr. Lieberman has to accept some responsibility for the dismal fact that Connecticut has placed 50th, that's dead last, in federal tax ratio,'' said Mr. Giordano, who likes to take credit for ''making the tough decisions'' that he says have started to turn around the faltering economy of his city.</p>
        <p>He says he is most proud of having produced three consecutive balanced budgets in Waterbury without raising taxes, and of cutting crime by 25 percent by increasing the police force.</p>
        <p>Those who know Mr. Giordano best say it would be a mistake for his opponent -- even a vice-presidential candidate with national stature -- to underestimate him the way former Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr. underestimated Mr. Lieberman in 1988. That's when Mr. Lieberman stunned the three-term incumbent despite polls at one time showing him more than 20 points behind.</p>
        <p>''I've known Phil for more than a decade and when he decides he wants something and that it's important he usually gets it,'' said Angela Juliani, a partner in his Waterbury law firm. ''When he announced he would run for mayor in 1995 few people gave him any chance to win. I'm hearing the same thing now about this race and I know better than to ever say Phil Giordano can't do something, no matter how long the odds.''</p>
