        <p>''You ever want to be somebody else?'' Peter Fonda asks, playing the ''Easy Rider'' of the movie's title. ''I never wanted to be anybody else.''</p>
        <p>The cliched vision of the 1960's odyssey is that of someone trying to find himself. ''Easy Rider'''s tag line made it clear that Fonda was a man who went looking instead ''for America'' and ''couldn't find it anywhere.''</p>
        <p>Even if it was the great odyssey picture of its time, it wasn't as much about a man looking for America as it was about a man making America look at him. And the way he looked -- his hippie clothes and long hair -- drove other characters in the film into a homicidal rage.</p>
        <p>Like all self-initiated odysseys, his made a small life epic.</p>
        <p>Circumstances today have rid us of small lives. Obsession with biography has made hourlong entertainment of pop life's most minor players, whether it's Meat Loaf or Milli Vanilli. The Internet has given every person with a wall outlet a bully pulpit. There's more drama in an episode of ''Survivor'' or in the true story of ''The Perfect Storm'' than in invented scripts. There are fewer people in the audience these days than on the stage.</p>
        <p>That's probably why the most hedonistic trend in this moment of luxury-seeking hedonism is risk decadence. The decadence of risk is typified by Tom Cruise's doing his own stunts in ''M:I-2.'' Like ''Easy Rider,'' it's putting yourself against a backdrop that might clash a bit with your personal culture. It's collecting passport stamps the way people used to collect Hummels and Steuben. In other words, who remembers safe, cozy cocooning?</p>
        <p>So this issue is dedicated to the epic odyssey that is every person's life today. Our odyssey in creating the issue lay in finding stories that still rang with the exoticism of the new. Unlike last season's, this fall's clothes don't feel like costumes for role playing. Designers instead are dressing women who aren't interested in becoming someone else, but who, like Fonda's character in ''Easy Rider,'' are putting the person they are into a vast variety of landscapes. They want to be a slightly more traveled, more interesting version of themselves. Much of what designers are showing is a generic vocabulary of chic, the fashion equivalent of architecture's International Style. We put those clothes to the test by photographing them in international settings, creating certainly the most far-reaching and far-flung issue of a fashion magazine ever mounted.</p>
        <p>Yet some of the best odysseys we chronicled were, like ''Easy Rider,'' less about location than about mental state. The trip through the invention of a couture suit, the search for love, a historic quest, the journey of a lifetime of achievement, an excursion back into childhood through food. Those trips can be taken in any clothes. (We offer a few suggestions on the following pages.)</p>
        <p>In the 1950's, fashion shoots almost always offered an exotic journey; an exotic journey offered an excuse to buy new clothes. And fashion, photographed in front of some monument to man or nature, was given a sheen of importance. Grandeur. Occasion. The same sheen of importance that a person taking a vacation photo feels chronicling themselves in a foreign place. Or chronicling themselves next to a celebrity: ''See? It happened to me.''</p>
        <p>What we found in putting together this issue was that whether you're carrying a nylon backpack or a 12-piece set of Louis Vuitton luggage, whether you're on the Concorde or in Aisle 34, Seat F, whether you're stopping by a coffee shop in Istanbul or a performance of ''Aida'' in Vienna, travel is still the most glamorous way to spend your money. Along with buying clothes, of course.</p>
        <p>If ''Easy Rider'' addressed the intolerance that appearances can provoke, we hope the fashion in this issue might have built a bridge or two. The fashion shoot is a tradition that doesn't exist in every culture. So we sent a bit of our cultural tradition around the world (and it must have looked a little strange to many of the people there), and we brought something of those places back.</p>
        <p>Maybe some tolerance can grow from that.</p>
