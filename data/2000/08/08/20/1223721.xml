        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Some comments about Erica Da Costa's review of my book ''Herman Melville'' (July 30). My study of ''Moby-Dick'' is not, as she claims, ''short on critical attention.'' On the matter of the book as fiction, and on the role of Starbuck, I take positions not always shared by some of the great critical works on Melville, and the retelling of this difficult book itself is an act of critical attention. About the suicide of Melville's son Malcolm, I give the reader what is known about it, taking the account mostly from Laurie Robertson-Lorant's biography. Concerning Hawthorne, he does not appear only in the chapter that bears his name, but in my discussion of what is thought to be Melville's use of him in the long, daunting poem ''Clarel.'' I ponder Melville's disappointment in the relationship just as all writers on the subject will. The phrase of Melville's, ''made up my mind to be annihilated,'' appears in Hawthorne's journal about Melville's visit in England. I came to believe that Melville's religious thought was not influenced by his mother's Calvinist affiliation, the position of many critics, so much as by his wide reading in the skeptical biblical criticism and anthropological thought of the period.</p>
        <p>My book studies all of Melville's writings, especially ''Redburn'' and ''The Confidence Man'' as well as the shorter works, ''Bartleby,'' ''Billy Budd'' and ''Benito Cereno,'' none of which is mentioned by the reviewer. I do not find Erica Da Costa sufficiently informed about Melville's many writings and the general critical opinion about them to be a proper reviewer for yet another book on the subject.</p>
