        <p>WITH their safety goggles on, the young men and women looked like the other scientists at the Ciba-Geigy Specialty Chemicals division here, except that jeans and sneakers, instead of khakis and safety shoes, peeked out from beneath their white lab coats.</p>
        <p>The 22 young people -- all high school students -- are part of a program that lets them play scientist in a top-flight industrial laboratory. Ciba-Geigy is hoping that they will become hooked.</p>
        <p>''From our perspective, the chemical industry needs to attract people,'' said Hugh Stuart-Buttle, the company's vice president of communications. ''We want to find bright young scientists and foster and encourage science. Our lifeblood is scientific innovation. Our ambition is to stimulate and attract people to join this industry. It's harder and harder to recruit good quality scientists.''</p>
        <p>The program, in its 11th year, is known as the Ciba-Geigy High School Chemistry Institute. And it seems to be having the desired effect.</p>
        <p>''I definitely want to do something with science,'' said Tracy Turo, one of the participants, who attends White Plains High School. ''This program really shows how industry works and what kinds of jobs are available.''</p>
        <p>Tracy, whose mother is a biologist, added: ''I actually thought it was a nice opportunity to be with kids with similar interests. A lot of the stuff we learned would be similar to introductory college material, but it's so much more relaxed here.''</p>
        <p>Joseph Lemberg, of Ossining High school, found the program, with its intense immersion in chemistry, surprising. ''It's very hands-on and very relaxed,'' he said. ''I was kind of lukewarm to chemistry before this. I liked physics more.''</p>
        <p>Open to high school students who have completed their junior year and are selected based on grades, recommendations and an interview, the two-week program offers students a combination of classroom work and corporate science experience in a wide variety of areas.</p>
        <p>About three years ago, Ciba-Geigy conducted a survey and found that two-thirds of the students who took part in the institute went on to major in math or science.</p>
        <p>This year's participants -- some of whom came from Alabama, where the company has a plant -- included students from Hastings-on-Hudson, Irvington, Mahopac, White Plains, Mamaroneck, Yorktown, Yonkers, Ossining, Briarcliff, Walter Panas High School in Lakeland, Pleasantville and Dobbs Ferry.</p>
        <p>''The students are spending time in our laboratory with chemists, working on the equipment doing experiments, and in some cases they're working on real stuff,'' Susan Vittorio, the institute coordinator, said.</p>
        <p>She added: ''We want to show them that with a background in chemistry, there are so many other things you can do, and so many opportunities.''</p>
        <p>Here, plastics rule. So the students saw a lab where scientists were trying to stabilize wax, a compelling issue for candle manufacturers; a weather-mimicking lab, to test how certain products would change under various climate conditions; and labs where plastic became garbage bags, deli-sandwich wrap, septic tanks, socks or even toys.</p>
        <p>Classroom work, which took place at Harrison High School and Pace University in Pleasantville (where students were housed), focused on introductory organic chemistry and polymer chemistry.</p>
        <p>''What happens here is that they see that what happens in the classroom relates directly to industry,'' said Mark Langella, who teaches advanced placement chemistry at Harrison High School and is in his 11th year working with the summer institute. ''What makes this worthwhile for me is to see the tremendous amount of potential here. These are top students, where future Einsteins develop, and the program gives them confidence to continue and motivation to ask the kinds of questions they need to ask. It shows that it's cool to be a scientist and to like science. Every year I come and learn something new that I can bring back to the classroom.''</p>
        <p>Andi Smith, a Ciba chemist who is pursuing her Ph.D. in chemistry at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn., said: ''I love this stuff. Someday I want to teach, and I love watching them get excited about something. Science has a really bad rap, especially for young ladies, and they need to see that it's not just books, and not just sitting still and having lectures.''</p>
        <p>This year there were more girls than boys in the program.</p>
        <p>''There's a realization that chemistry is in so many parts of their daily lives that it's very much about our life,'' Mr. Stuart-Buttle said.</p>
        <p>''The program tends to blow away some notion that scientists are boring,'' he added. ''It shows the variety of work that's done, and shows that people aren't just stuck in a laboratory.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 27, 2000, Sunday  An article last Sunday about a summer program for high school chemistry students misstated the name of the sponsoring company. It is Ciba Specialty Chemicals, not Ciba-Geigy Specialty Chemicals.</p>
