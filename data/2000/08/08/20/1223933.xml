        <p>It might have been an African-American walk of fame along what many people consider the gateway to Harlem. But a plan to turn 110th Street, bordering Central Park, into a ''heritage corridor'' commemorating famous black Americans has been modified after some preservationists opposed the design.</p>
        <p>The plan, proposed by the nonprofit Cityscape Institute, the Empire State Development Corporation and the city's Department of Transportation, called for renovation of both sides of 110th Street, from Fifth Avenue to Frederick Douglass Boulevard, and the installation of up to 50 new street lamps.</p>
        <p>Cityscape proposed placing plaques atop each of the lamps, with images of important black leaders and pioneers, as well as historical information about them. Cityscape had nominated 120 people for the  profiles, and hoped that residents of Harlem would choose whom to include.</p>
        <p>But two preservation groups, Landmarks West and the Society for the Architecture of the City, opposed the plan, saying the lights were inconsistent with the park's architecture. They also worried that the slots for the plaques could be used for advertising, and might invite vandalism.</p>
        <p>In July, the city's Art Commission  voted to allow the lights, but not the plaques. Cityscape intends to begin  renovation in the late fall.</p>
        <p>''We're glad that the Art Commission made modifications to the original design,'' said Christabel Gough, the secretary for the architecture society.</p>
        <p>But John T. Reddick, director of government and community relations for Cityscape, said he was  miffed by the decision.</p>
        <p>''I was surprised that people who are preservationists and interested in history thought that the buildings were more important than the players,'' he said. ''Because to me, the history is defined by the people.''</p>
