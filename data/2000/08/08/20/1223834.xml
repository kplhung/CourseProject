        <p>IN most downtowns, the opening of a new coffee bar or Tex-Mex restaurant would be a minor event. In the 2.4-square-mile Bergen County, N.J., Borough of Oradell, the recent arrival of Cool Beans, Badlands Tacos and the Little Dipper ice cream parlor on Kinderkamack Road symbolized a break with the restrictive past and the harbinger of redevelopment.</p>
        <p>''The town was dying, mainly because of competition from nearby malls,'' said Borough Councilwoman Linda Besink. ''It had deteriorated and was unattractive, and our zoning was so prohibitive that it precluded the opening of any new eatery. So we passed a more liberal zoning ordinance three years ago and embarked on an ambitious improvement program.''</p>

        <p>IN most downtowns, the opening of a new coffee bar or Tex-Mex restaurant would be a minor event. In the 2.4-square-mile Bergen County, N.J., Borough of Oradell, the recent arrival of Cool Beans, Badlands Tacos and the Little Dipper ice cream parlor on Kinderkamack Road symbolized a break with the restrictive past and the harbinger of redevelopment.</p>
        <p>''The town was dying, mainly because of competition from nearby malls,'' said Borough Councilwoman Linda Besink. ''It had deteriorated and was unattractive, and our zoning was so prohibitive that it precluded the opening of any new eatery. So we passed a more liberal zoning ordinance three years ago and embarked on an ambitious improvement program.''</p>
        <p>Stretching for a mile along Kinderkamack Road, the county's main north-south artery, the turn-of-the-century business district is now about half renovated. On the southern end, starting at the River Edge border, the road has been widened to increase the number of parking spots, and new brick sidewalks, Victorian-style lighting, benches and flowering trees have been installed.</p>
        <p>By the end of 2002, the project is expected to stretch northward to the River Edge line, two small parks along Kinderkamack Road are to be reconstructed and two new ones will be added.</p>
        <p>Like the new restaurants and the ice cream shop, nearly all businesses in the downtown are service oriented. They include two older restaurants -- Hagler's Bar and Grill and Charlie Brown's -- half a dozen banks, several beauty parlors and nail salons, a dry cleaner, an Italian deli and a pizzeria.</p>
        <p>Most residents do their food shopping in neighboring towns and their major shopping in the Paramus Park, Bergen, Fashion Center and Riverside Square malls, all of which are within a seven-mile radius of the borough. But the improvements within the town have helped not only to beautify it but also to strengthen its real estate market.</p>
        <p>Curiously, road improvements a century ago also played an important role in Oradell's history.</p>
        <p>First settled in 1725 by French Huguenots, it remained a part of the larger Midland Township until 1894. But then local residents voted to break away and form their own municipality because they were about to be taxed $2,400 for township-wide road improvements, only $600 of which were to be made in what would become Oradell.</p>
        <p>Widely credited with the recent improvement work is the popular second-term mayor, James D. Snedeker, who ran on a redevelopment platform. He obtained grants that are financing more than three-quarters of the $4.2 million undertaking.</p>
        <p>The county Department of Transportation, which is responsible for the congested Kinderkamack Road, is supplying $1.9 million, the New Jersey Department of Transportation is putting up nearly $700,000 and smaller grants have been made by New Jersey Transit and several institutions.</p>
        <p>''We could have asked the businesses to pay for the sidewalks and other improvements,'' Mayor Snedeker said. ''But they had been hard-hit enough by the deterioration of the downtown.''</p>
        <p>Today the mayor's future in public life is the main topic of conversation in Oradell. On Aug. 11 the State Supreme Court announced that it had disbarred Mayor Snedeker and banned him from practicing law in the state again for misappropriation of client trust funds.</p>
        <p>Last Tuesday night the six-member borough council took up the question of whether the mayor should be asked to resign, and the mayor declared that he was competent to remain in office. No action was taken.</p>
        <p>THE mayor's troubles will have no effect on the town's strong real estate market, said Margrit Vogler, an associate with Re/Max Real Estate Limited on Kinderkamack Road.</p>
        <p>Housing prices have risen 16 percent over the last 12 months, Ms. Vogler said, with many homes selling within a week of being publicized in the Multiple Listing Service.</p>
        <p>Ms. Vogler identifies the buyers as mainly returning Oradell natives, move-up buyers currently living in the borough or people from nearby communities.</p>
        <p>''This is a great market, but a frustrating one,'' she said. ''So many buyers and so little inventory.''</p>
        <p>Oradell's housing stock is a mixture of Victorians, 1920's colonials and postwar Cape Cods, split-levels, ranches and colonials. Many first-time visitors recognize the Victorians along Grove Street, which was laid out just after the 1870 arrival of the Hackensack and New Jersey Extension Railroad.</p>
        <p>Those houses have appeared in numerous television commercials for Sony, Sara Lee, Kodak and other companies. Ms. Vogler says that the large Victorians rarely come on the market and would probably sell for $500,000 or more. Recently, a small, three-bedroom colonial on the corner of Grove and Oradell Avenue -- a busy intersection -- went for $405,000.</p>
        <p>At the beginning of last week, the M.L.S. included 21 Oradell houses ranging in price from $239,000 to $695,000. The least expensive was on Beverly Road in the southern Manor section, a two-street area of narrow older colonials on small lots.</p>
        <p>At the top of the market was a sprawling, four-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bath ranch with an in-ground pool on Briarwood Court in the prestigious Blauvelt area, near the northern border with the Borough of Emerson.</p>
        <p>Another highly desirable area is Latch String, on the western edge of the borough, near the Paramus line. Named for a restaurant that closed in 1958, Latch String has trees 70 feet tall, sloping front lawns and few sidewalks. Homes there, ranging from small, brick Capes to stately colonials, sell for $350,000 to $550,000, according to Ms. Vogler.</p>
        <p>The town has four small garden-apartment complexes on Maple Street, Kinderkamack Road and New Milford Avenue. Together, they have about 100 one-  and two-bedroom units renting for $750 to $1,200.</p>
        <p>The only condominium apartments are in the Hallmark Arms, a converted 26-unit garden-apartment complex on Center Street. Ms. Vogler says that apartments there are rarely offered for sale, but when they are they go for about $130,000 for one-bedrooms and $165,000 for two bedrooms.</p>
        <p>There are also about two dozen two-bedroom condominium town houses in two small complexes on Kinderkamack Road and on Marcom Terrace. Last March, a two-bedroom town house sold for $153,000 and this year, another is listed at $240,000.</p>
        <p>Last April, Joann and John Healey bought a four-bedroom split-level on Wildwood Road in the Latch String area and moved from nearby Ridgefield Park. Mr. Healey works as a stagehand at Lincoln Center and Mrs. Healey is employed at the Oradell Public Library. They have a 9-year-old daughter and an 8-year-old son.</p>
        <p>''We wanted a good school system,'' Mrs. Healey said. ''And during the season at Lincoln Center, John can sometimes work from 8 a.m. until midnight. So we wanted to be within a 20-mile commute of Manhattan. We saw the different towns, but fell in love with the huge trees and the charm of Latch String.''</p>
        <p>The Healeys' children attend the 700-student K-6 Oradell Public School, a sprawling cupola-topped brick building constructed in 1929 on a large Prospect Avenue campus. The average class size is 20, compared with a state average of 21.6.</p>
        <p>School Superintendent Karen A. Lake says that the school stresses basic study skills but places strong emphasis on technology. Computers are introduced in kindergarten, and each classroom is connected to the Internet and has at least three computers.</p>
        <p>IN seventh grade, Oradell youngsters enter the River Dell Regional School District, which is shared with neighboring River Edge. It comprises the 423-student River Dell Middle School in River Edge for grades seven and eight and the 823-student River Dell High School in Oradell.</p>
        <p>Of last year's 165-student high school graduating class, 96 percent went on to higher education. On the College Boards, the graduates had combined verbal and mathematics averages of 1,115, 107 points above the state average.</p>
        <p>The high school offers 10 advanced placement courses in English, history, mathematics, the sciences and foreign languages. It also offers four college credit courses, under the Syracuse University Project Advance program.</p>
        <p>According to the superintendent of schools, Dr. Lillian A. DeSimon, the district stresses technology. All students must take at least one computer science course and are expected to be proficient in word processing, spread sheets and computer presentations before they graduate.</p>
        <p>In 1998, River Dell High School received the coveted title of blue ribbon school of excellence from the United States Department of Education.</p>
        <p>Oradell also has two parochial schools, the all-male Bergen Catholic High School and the St. Joseph's School, a K-8 Roman Catholic Grade School.</p>
        <p>Oradell has four major parks, the largest of which is the 15-acre Memorial Field off Oradell Avenue. It has four baseball diamonds, two soccer fields, two lighted basketball courts, five lighted tennis courts, two lighted skating ponds and playground equipment.</p>
        <p>The Old Firehouse Theater on Kinderkamack Road is home to the 67-year-old Bergen County Players community theater group.</p>
        <p>Oradell is also home to the Hiram Blauvelt Wildlife Art Museum, in a renovated 19th-century carriage house on Kinderkamack Road. It contains a vast collection of stuffed game animals and wildlife art.</p>
