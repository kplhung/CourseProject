        <p>There's a very easy litmus test to differentiate the designers who are on a lifelong odyssey* of aesthetic-altering proportions and the designers who are just churning out shmattes. Here's what you do: Head over to Bergdorf Goodman, or Saks, or any store that carries the widest selection of designers you're curious about. Pick one designer outfit from each rack. Better yet (we don't want any cheating), have a sales clerk or a friend pick for you. Then heap them all in a ''Farenheit 451''-style pile in the center of the floor. Now, try to pick out each designer's work. No looking at labels. And no using cell phones for a lifeline. Not easy, is it? I'd suggest that history has left us with maybe 40 designers whose work, no matter what the season, is instantly recognizable. Some of those designers -- like Gianfranco Ferre or Norma Kamali or Geoffrey Beene -- are out of favor with trendy fashion, though the strength of their signatures is undeniable. As the Pegasuses and LVMH's and YSL-Gucci's acquire and desire labels, I would counsel them to hesitate before backing any name that can't pass the style pile test. Of course, the nine designers included here pass with flying colors.</p>
