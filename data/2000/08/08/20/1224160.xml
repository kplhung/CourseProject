        <p>Senator John McCain of Arizona sailed through five and a half hours of surgery for two malignant melanomas today without complications and with no immediate indication that the cancer had spread, his doctors said.</p>
        <p>The operation involved removal of two malignant melanomas from his left temple and left upper arm along with lymph nodes from his neck and a portion of his salivary gland.</p>
        <p>But only after pathologists look at the lymph node through a microscope next week can a determination be made about whether it contains cancerous melanoma cells, Dr. John D. Eckstein, Mr. McCain's personal physician at the Mayo Clinic Hospital, said at a news conference here.</p>
        <p>''My husband is in wonderful shape and we have a wonderful report,'' Cindy McCain told reporters. Her husband was cracking jokes in his hospital room after he awoke fromanesthesia, she said, and ''all my prayers have been answered.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain's doctors, though expressing optimism, introduced a note of caution. Dr. Eckstein, a specialist in internal medicine, and the team of surgeons said it was premature to speculate on future medical plans.</p>
        <p>The pathology tests that will be performed early next week are crucial because if the cancer is confined to the skin, as preliminary tests earlier in the week and today indicated, Mr. McCain's prognosis will be as favorable as it was after the malignant melanoma was removed from his left shoulder in 1993. Mr. McCain received no therapy beyond surgical removal of the shoulder melanoma, and doctors have pronounced him cured of it.</p>
        <p>Preliminary pathological tests indicate a good outlook. Dr. Michael L. Hinni, a head and neck cancer surgeon who led the team, said quick tests known as frozen sections showed that ''all melanoma was removed during the surgery.'' But experts not connected with Mr. McCain's case said that frozen sections can be unreliable for melanoma.</p>
        <p>If pathology tests show that the new melanoma has spread to a lymph node, Mr. McCain will need further treatment such as chemotherapy.</p>
        <p>Of the two new melanomas, the one from the left upper arm was least troublesome because it was caught at cancer's earliest stage, a type known as ''in situ.'' It can be considered ''a precursor to a real melanoma'' that rarely if ever, spreads, or metastasizes, said Dr. Lynn M. Schuchter, a melanoma expert at the University of Pennsylvania and a member of the American Society of Clinical Oncology's communications committee.</p>
        <p>The temple melanoma obviously was more worrisome because the surgeons took the extra steps of performing many magnetic resonance imaging and CAT scans, a specialized type of X-rays, earlier in the week and removing lymph nodes today.</p>
        <p>The temple melanoma was at least 2.2 millimeters deep as measured in a biopsy that was performed at the Bethesda Naval Medical Center on Aug. 4. Such depth is a critical factor in determining a melanoma patient's prognosis. Mr. McCain's temple melanoma would be classified as type 2 for which textbooks cite 10-year survival figures of about 60 percent to 70 percent.</p>
        <p>Today's surgery involved injecting a blue dye and radioactive tracer into the melanoma on the temple in a procedure known as a sentinel lymphoscintigraphy. Later in the operation, the doctors used a gamma counter to locate the tracer in the first node draining lymph fluid from the temple, an indication of the path by which the cancerous melanoma cells would most likely spread. The doctors also removed a number of additional lymph nodes.</p>
        <p>A sentinel node procedure allows pathologists to slice the node like a loaf of bread in the laboratory and then use chemical stains to provide a more comprehensive analysis than can often be accomplished by examining sections of a dozen or so lymph nodes.</p>
        <p>Surgical removal of melanomas is standard therapy, and in the next phase of Mr. McCain's surgery, the doctors took the precaution of removing a wide area of skin surrounding the melanoma.</p>
        <p>In the final step of the operation, the doctors reconstructed the skin and soft tissue overlying the temple, face and neck.</p>
        <p>It will take several days for the swelling and bruising of Mr. McCain's face and neck to subside. He is expected to remain in the hospital for two or three days.</p>
