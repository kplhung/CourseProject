        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani named Correction Commissioner Bernard B. Kerik as New York City's next police commissioner yesterday, turning to a former narcotics detective and familiar member of his administration to command the nation's largest police department.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerik, 44, will replace Howard Safir, a retired federal agent and Mr. Giuliani's confidant and friend of 25 years. Mr. Safir said this month that he would resign after four and a half years in the job. The mayor announced Mr. Kerik's appointment at a news conference at City Hall, where Mr. Safir handed to Mr. Kerik the 99-year-old commissioner's shield, made of solid gold.</p>
        <p>''Bernie has the thing so important as police commissioner, having served as a police officer, understanding the difficulties and split-second decisions an officer has to make,'' Mr. Giuliani said in a room packed with administration, correction and police officials and Mr. Kerik's family. ''He brings a quality of leadership.''</p>
        <p>The new commissioner's appointment is effective at 12:01 a.m. tomorrow, and he will be sworn in sometime in the next 10 days as the department's 40th commissioner in just under 100 years. He will take command of the 41,000-member force at a time when crime has fallen sharply but the department has suffered intense criticism from within and without. Morale among the rank and file has also withered, with officers embittered by what they believe is miserly pay.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerik won the department's Medal of Valor for his role in a shootout as a narcotics detective, and his achievements have been significant at the City Department of Correction, where he brought about substantial declines in violence in the jail system and reduced overtime and sick time while creating a new esprit de corps in an agency long known for its poor morale. But some critics have said that his lack of a college degree, a requirement for the rank of captain and higher in the department, sends the wrong message when the department is struggling to recruit qualified candidates.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerik is 24 credits short of a bachelor's degree in labor relations at Empire State College.</p>
        <p>His selection is the most prominent element of a broader change in the city's police hierarchy. Mr. Giuliani said yesterday that Chief of Department Joseph P. Dunne would be the new first deputy commissioner, filling a largely behind-the-scenes post overseeing discipline and labor relations. He will succeed Patrick E. Kelleher, who retired last week.</p>
        <p>Chief Dunne, 52, a highly respected police administrator, was one of  three finalists to lead the Police Department. The other was Dennison Young Jr., counsel to the mayor.</p>
        <p>Chief Dunne, who sat between Mr. Safir and Mr. Kelleher as the mayor announced that Mr. Kerik would lead the Police Department, looked disappointed but pledged his full support to Mr. Kerik, saying, ''Commissioner Kerik, we're a team now.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani said that the last three candidates he considered were Mr. Young, Chief Dunne and Mr. Kerik, ''and the city is going to have the good fortune of having all three of them working together, along with others, because we work as a team, to continue to build on this record that is such a superb one.''</p>
        <p>The mayor also singled out Chief  Dunne for praise during the ceremony, at which the popular chief seemed to get the longest and loudest applause, and hugged him onstage.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Safir handed over the commissioner's shield, a blue-and-gold cloisonne badge bearing five platinum stars and the seal of the city, Mr. Kerik paused, seeming to savor the moment. He later recalled his years as a military police officer in Korea, where he served as a dog handler, and said he often read books about the New York Police Department and thought about joining.</p>
        <p>''This is something I never dreamed of, something I never thought would happen,'' he said.</p>
        <p>As commissioner, Mr. Kerik faces many challenges, and his window of opportunity will be small, with 16 months left in Mr. Giuliani's final term as mayor. In spite of its successes, the department has endured sharp criticism in recent years.</p>
        <p>Relations between the police and minority residents remain strained after the torture of Abner Louima in a Brooklyn station house in 1997 and the fatal shootings of four unarmed black men in a 13-month period that ended in March. The department is also facing the possibility of federal oversight because of a finding by the United States attorney's office in Brooklyn that it has failed to adequately discipline officers who use excessive force.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the department is struggling to recruit members and retain its veterans while it negotiates a contract with a police union that believes its members have been badly shortchanged.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani said Mr. Kerik's solid relations with labor unions had been a factor in his selection, and that Mr. Kerik was unpopular when he first took over the agency but had won over the union leaders.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Mr. Kerik was praised by Correction Department union officials and fraternal groups, including the head of the department's Hispanic Society, Agustin Quinones, who said Mr. Kerik had added Latinos in management, and Norman Seabrook, president of the New York City Correction Officers' Benevolent Association.</p>
        <p>Mr. Seabrook called Mr. Kerik a friend and said the commissioner had been consistently willing to address problems pointed out to him by the union. ''He will show that he is able to work with a diverse group of people and make things work,'' Mr. Seabrook said.</p>
        <p>Patrick J. Lynch, the president of the police union, the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, said he was looking forward to working with Mr. Kerik.</p>
        <p>At the news conference, Mayor Giuliani dismissed critics who contend that the Police Department needs to reach out to minority residents; he repeated that the department was among the most restrained in the nation, a conclusion he based on declining numbers of shootings and civilian complaints. He suggested that any perceptions of discomfort among blacks and Hispanics were created by the news media and a few politicians.</p>
        <p>But several community leaders disagreed, including Dennis M. Walcott, president of the New York Urban League, who said building bridges while continuing to reduce crime would be Mr. Kerik's ''monumental challenge.'' He cited the Urban League's State of Black New York poll, which found that more than 80 percent of the respondents  believed that police brutality was a serious issue. Mr. Walcott said the new commissioner should talk to people in churches and on the streets, laying out his goals.</p>
        <p>''There is more to it than charts and statistics, and that's the challenge for the commissioner,'' Mr.  Walcott said. He said that regardless of statistics or even realities, perceptions had to be addressed, and that police policies had ''a broad influence on what people say and think.''</p>
        <p>Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, spoke at a news conference yesterday with the Rev. Al Sharpton, who criticized the selection of Mr. Kerik. Mr. Siegel said the mayor erred in failing to reach out to residents as part of the selection process, which seemed strangely shrouded in secrecy and dragged on for 10 days.</p>
        <p>''We blew an opportunity to bring people together, to put some of the confrontation, some of the anger, and some of the rage behind us,'' Mr. Siegel said. ''We would like to be optimistic about the appointment, but we cannot.''</p>
        <p>After the City Hall news conference, Mr. Kerik said he planned to spend a good deal of time on the streets, meeting with New Yorkers. In fact, aides said he and the mayor, accompanied by Chief Dunne, would visit a church today. Mr. Kerik also cited his record at the Department of Correction, where 80 percent of the officers and staff members are minority employees. ''People have to give me a chance,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''I think it is essential for New Yorkers to see me and understand that I am there for their concerns,'' he said. ''I am going to look at their  issues. I am going to visit the cops. I am going to visit the communities.''</p>
        <p>A native of Paterson, N.J., Mr. Kerik, who lives in Riverdale, the Bronx, spent eight years in the Police Department, and was one of Mr. Giuliani's bodyguards during his 1993 campaign. He joined the Department of Correction in 1994 as the director of investigations. He was appointed first deputy commissioner in 1995 and commissioner in late 1997.</p>
        <p>Before joining the New York police, he was warden of the Passaic County Jail in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerik said he hoped to bring to the Police Department some of the management techniques he used at the Department of Correction. He said his program, initially modeled on the Police Department's Compstat meetings, helped him use strict accountability to reduce violence and overtime pay and to improve efficiency.</p>
        <p>The Correction Department has 12,400 uniformed and civilian employees and an annual budget of $830 million. The Police Department has nearly 50,000 uniformed and civilian employees and a $2.3 billion budget.</p>
        <p>He also said that while the union leaders at the Department of Correction found him to be ''a very aggressive manager,'' they found that quality tempered by an equally strong sense of fairness.</p>
        <p>City Councilman Sheldon S. Leffler, a Queens Democrat who heads the Public Safety Committee and has long been a critic of Mr. Safir, said he had some reservations about Mr. Kerik. He pointed to Mr. Kerik's lack of a college degree and the fact that he had left the department as a detective and would now be commanding officials of much higher rank.</p>
        <p>In the civilian job of commissioner, Mr. Kerik is not required to have a degree. But officers entering the department must have earned 60 college credits, and a degree is required for all ranks above lieutenant.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani dismissed the lack of a college degree as a nonissue.</p>
        <p>During yesterday's news conference at City Hall, Mr. Kerik also praised Mr. Dunne and thanked him for staying even though the mayor had not chosen him for the top job. Mr. Dunne, speaking about being passed over, said: ''I'd be lying if I were to say that I'm not terribly disappointed today in not getting the job. I think that the next time I look at a Miss U.S.A. contest and they announce the first runner-up, I will most assuredly be able to say, 'Boy, I know how you feel.' ''</p>
        <p>But he said his place was in the Police Department. ''I love this job; I love this city; I love the N.Y.P.D.,'' he said. ''And I would've stayed if he'd made me the dog catcher.''</p>
