        <p>To the Editor: As I was leaving a Days Inn in Chicago recently, I discovered I had been charged $1 a day for the privilege of having a safe in my room, although I never used it. The desk clerk refused to deduct the charge from my bill. The reservations person at the 800 number referred me back to the hotel and then grudgingly gave me the number for customer service. The customer service person told me that the hotel is independently operated.</p>

        <p>When I went back to my office, I learned that one of my employees was also charged for having a safe in his room in the Days Inn in Washington.</p>
        <p>NORMAN A. ROSS  New York, N.Y.</p>
        <p>David Jimenez, a spokesman for Days Inns, responds: Our policy is to make safe deposit boxes available at no charge or for a minimal fee to all registered guests. If customers do not use the safe, they can get a refund immediately at the front desk or through our customer service department if extenuating circumstances arise. This did not happen with Mr. Ross, for which we apologize. If he sends a copy of his bill, we will reimburse him for the charges against his account.</p>
