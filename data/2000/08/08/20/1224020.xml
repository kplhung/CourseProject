        <p>IT looked like an instance of fashion by fiat. When she strolled out in front of the cameras at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday night, Tipper Gore was sheathed in blue, her lustrous coat by Ellen Tracy lending her an aura of beatitude. Mrs. Gore was just the last of the candidates' wives who arrived for their respective spotlight moments decked out in tints of blue like so many blossoms in a Victorian nosegay.</p>
        <p>There was Hillary Rodham Clinton, wearing not her customary neutral trouser suit, but a matching skirt and jacket of the purest cornflower blue. Onstage, before taking the podium, she received a group hug from a flock of women, most of them suited in blue. Next was Hadassah Lieberman, who played to the crowd in a suit whose hyacinth hue looked freshly plucked from a suburban garden.</p>

        <p>IT looked like an instance of fashion by fiat. When she strolled out in front of the cameras at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday night, Tipper Gore was sheathed in blue, her lustrous coat by Ellen Tracy lending her an aura of beatitude. Mrs. Gore was just the last of the candidates' wives who arrived for their respective spotlight moments decked out in tints of blue like so many blossoms in a Victorian nosegay.</p>
        <p>There was Hillary Rodham Clinton, wearing not her customary neutral trouser suit, but a matching skirt and jacket of the purest cornflower blue. Onstage, before taking the podium, she received a group hug from a flock of women, most of them suited in blue. Next was Hadassah Lieberman, who played to the crowd in a suit whose hyacinth hue looked freshly plucked from a suburban garden.</p>
        <p>By the time Mrs. Gore took center stage, embracing her blue-clad daughter Karenna, one could not help but wonder. In politics, where no gesture can be counted as spontaneous, this ubiquitous blue suit looked contrived, a result of canny image coaching.</p>
        <p>Those acquainted with the closets of the candidates' wives deny anyone acted in concert, but concede that blue, often considered safe and dull, was indeed the most popular choice for women on the convention floor.</p>
        <p>''Blue, I can't imagine a better choice,'' mused Bonnie McNies, an image consultant, who used to advise Mrs. Gore as a senator's wife. Mrs. McNies trilled a hymn to the Democratic ladies' color of choice. ''Blue is soothing but powerful,'' she said. ''It's smart, but not trendy like black. It suggests harmony among team players. It suggests unity.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton is certainly savvy about the associative powers of color, especially the power of certain colors to flatter or disarm. Robin Givhan, a former style reporter for The Washington Post, who is now at Vogue, suggested the First Lady might lately have adopted blue along with skirts both to soften her image and to define it more sharply. ''Everyone assigns a color to recent first ladies,'' Ms. Givhan noted. ''Nancy Reagan had red. Barbara had cadet blue. But Hillary never had a color.''</p>
        <p>In the collective consciousness, blue is often the color of clarity, piety and goodness (think of a Swiss mountain lake or a Raphael Madonna). To some minds, blue also conveys true love and fidelity. And sure enough, Mrs. Gore treated audiences on Thursday night to a vintage snapshot of herself hanging laundry in front of her trailer home, garbed in -- what else? -- a housedress of faded blue.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Gore underscored the meaning of true blue by introducing her husband simply as ''the man I love and have loved for 30 years.''</p>
        <p>Earlier that week, Mrs. Lieberman, wore blue as she introduced her husband as ''the love of my life.''</p>
        <p>Did any or all of them choose blue to make a political statement?</p>
        <p>''Not at all,'' said Camille Johnston, Mrs. Gore's press secretary. ''There is no consensus-building around wardrobe here.'' So, as fashion people are so fond of saying, maybe it's just something in the air.</p>
