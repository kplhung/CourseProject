        <p>Daryl Kerrigan, or Daryl K, as her label is known, was dressed for her Proustian journey.</p>
        <p>Her clothes always whistle a cool hipbone-is-connected-to-the-cheekbone tune; and on this night, she wore a sheer black shirt, low-slung blue jeans dusted with gold paint and jeweled mules with serious heels.</p>
        <p>Like Alice through the looking glass (if Alice were played by Charlotte Rampling with a Dublin accent), Kerrigan, 36, sat at the robust wood table that her partner, Paul Leonard, also 36, built for them in the kitchen of their unfancy East Village loft. Although they both come from Ireland, Kerrigan and Leonard met at the rock club CBGB about 13 years ago.</p>
        <p>Leonard, who works with Kerrigan, was returning late this night from a trip to Chicago. And their 2-year-old son, Fionn, having already eaten, was devoting himself to the Teletubbies on TV.</p>
        <p>Potato and leek soup, poached Irish salmon and Eve's pudding -- an upside-down cake crowned with fruit -- was prepared by Hank Tomashevski, a caterer, from a menu suggested by the designer. ''People just love wandering into the past, don't they?'' she asked, sipping her potato and leek soup and laughing. ''As long as you don't get maudlin, or as my mother calls it, 'the Irish Problem.' We were six in my house in the suburbs of Dublin -- four men and two women -- and the potatoes were my job. This enormous kitchen sink filled with spuds and running water so cold your hands would freeze. I did the peeling, and my mom did the cooking. Dinner was usually a meat and a potato. Some cabbage. Loads of cabbage. I always hated cabbage.</p>
        <p>''There was a good spirit in my house,'' she continued, ''a vibe that life was meant to be lived to the fullest. Music was a big part of that. Al Green used to be God to me. I'd listen to him for hours on the stereo in my room. Just thinking about Al Green and America together, and the power of that emotion.</p>
        <p>''Designers thinking in an emotive state,'' she deadpanned.</p>
        <p>Kerrigan's mother, a fashionable woman whom she describes affectionately as a ''clothes head,'' loved Neil Diamond. ''So there would be that, all this loud Neil Diamond music playing in the house during the cleaning up. Then there was good TV. We watched a lot of BBC documentaries, and had discussions after. Or my mother would talk about what she was reading -- she read a lot of Germaine Greer. Intellectual discussions. Not highbrow, just everyone very interested.''</p>
        <p>And her father? ''That's the bad part,'' Kerrigan recalled. ''We'd be in the middle of these great talks, and my dad would arrive home, polluted. And everything would change. But that is part of Irish life, a part of a lot of people's lives. It doesn't give me pain. You grow to accept that nothing is perfect. Everything has its reasons, and you grow and learn and deal because you're more experienced. I appreciate experience.''</p>
        <p>Her father now lives in Wales, and her mother in Dublin, which Kerrigan visits often. Inspired by her mother's fashion sense and dressmaking abilities, Kerrigan enrolled at the National College of Art and Design in Dublin. ''I always had a sewing machine, and I always made clothes for myself -- cool-fitting pants,'' she said, smiling. ''The cool factor has always been an issue. The greatest influence on me was always rock 'n' roll, especially when I came to New York. The thing is, you have to know fashion, know all about it, but then keep it at some distance. Too much fashion is not really right for many people's personalities. Anyway, the tutors at college often thought what I was doing was wrong.''</p>
        <p>In her final year, Kerrigan designed a collection inspired by ''Carmen'' and the music of Herb Alpert. ''Big 1980's polka dots,'' she said. ''It was good, but the music wasn't cued properly, and the show was a disaster. And that was it -- I was out of there. I was moving to America!'' She had already spent a summer in New York, waitressing at the Abbey Tavern. Sitting at her kitchen table, Kerrigan leaned forward and helped herself to the poached Irish salmon and confessed: ''We weren't really a fish-on-Friday family, although we always went to Mass on Sundays. And salmon was a bit of a treat. Mostly, it was cod.''</p>
        <p>When she arrived in New York with her pink-and-gray leopard-skin pants and gray, suede winkle pickers -- translation: spike heels with pointy toes -- the city was a fantasy. ''Unlike England, which isn't a place where Irish people come and realize their dreams, New York was it. Coming over the bridge from Kennedy Airport is an amazing experience. Every time you come home, you feel this buzz, this powerful connection with all the possibilities.''</p>
        <p>In the beginning, Kerrigan wasn't attracted to the fashion scene. ''The 1980's,'' she shrugged, ''weren't great. I made my own clothes, or bought vintage. I waitressed for almost a year, hung out with friends in rock 'n' roll clubs and then, through a friend, got into the movie business doing wardrobes for 'My Cousin Vinny' and 'Mystery Train.' I never knew if I'd ever really do 'fashion.' ''</p>
        <p>If she missed Ireland at all, she missed ''the solitude, and the country.'' But in 1991, with about $40,000 in savings, Kerrigan opened her first shop way east, on Sixth Street. Without any advertising or public relations, it took a bit of time for the fashion crowd to discover her.</p>
        <p>Now, Daryl K has two other shops -- on Bond Street, and in Los Angeles on Melrose. She and Leonard are moving to a house in Brooklyn, and they have a country place upstate. In 1996 she received a Perry Ellis Award, for emerging talent, from the Council of Fashion Designers of America, and she has been a consultant to Tommy Hilfiger. She recently entered into an agreement with Pegasus Apparel Group to help finance the growth of her company. A men's line is planned for later this year.</p>
        <p>''It's perfect!'' Kerrigan exclaimed, tasting the Eve's pudding with its jewel-like topping. She remembered a moment a few weeks earlier, when she and Leonard had just signed with Pegasus. They were walking on Fifth Avenue and noticed La Reserve, one of the restaurants where she had waitressed in her salad days. ''We stood inside the doorway for a few minutes just looking and remembering,'' Kerrigan said. ''The matre d' was fuming, looking at me up and down. You could read his mind, 'Who's the slut?''' Kerrigan laughed. ''I told him I used to work here, and he responded, 'What?!'''</p>
        <p>Daryl Kerrigan ate her cake, and added, ''In any city, Dublin or New York, where you are judged by how you look, you've got to rebel. You have to. That is an international rule.''</p>
