        <p>WHILE much of the land along the 18-mile Hudson River shoreline has sprouted housing in the last few years, a 10-acre slice of waterfront in this Hudson County township has long sat dormant except for a stand of cattails that swayed to the river breezes.</p>
        <p>Now the site, which juts out to the river across from the West 70's in Manhattan, is filling with the first of two planned luxury rental buildings that will contain 507 one-  to three-bedroom apartments, some with terraces. Each of the 12-story beige-brick buildings will have a health club and parking garage.</p>
        <p>The project is called Half Moon Harbour, a name that refers both to the shape of part of the site and to Henry Hudson's sailing ship. The developer, the Barrett Companies of Fort Lee, is proceeding after six and a half years of debate and legal haggling over neighbors' concerns about the project's density and its impact on traffic and Manhattan skyline views, among other issues. An out-of-court settlement ended the debate in 1998.</p>
        <p>The total development cost of the project is estimated at more than $20 million. The architect is the Edgewater firm of Cybul &amp; Cybul. Construction of the first building is nearing completion and leasing of its 176 apartments is to start this fall.</p>
        <p>Though projects in other Hudson County riverfront towns, like Jersey City or Hoboken, as well as Edgewater in neighboring Bergen County, have attracted more attention, Half Moon Harbour will be only the second housing development to rise on North Bergen's quarter-mile waterfront. It will also occupy one of the last large tracts at the river's edge there.</p>
        <p>During the 1980's building boom, the site was owned by another developer, who hoped to put up a various types of housing on it, including three 17-story buildings. But only 70 town houses were built on an adjacent riverfront parcel before the developer ran into financial difficulties and lost the property through tax and mortgage foreclosures.</p>
        <p>Twenty-eight unsold town houses in that 70-unit development, called Roc Harbor, were eventually sold by the lender to investors. By late 1994, the Barrett Companies had bought or contracted to buy the four individual parcels that make up the 10-acre Half Moon Harbour site for what Thomas Barrett, the company's president, would only say was a reasonable price.</p>
        <p>Of the ensuing legal wrangling, he said, given the site's location and potential, ''it was worth fighting for.'' This is the first riverfront housing project for the company, which has built residential and commercial developments in New Jersey and New York.</p>
        <p>For North Bergen, an ethnically diverse community of 55,000 people with an annual median income of $33,000, the Half Moon Harbour project is part of a delayed economic turnaround. With limited waterfront land, the 5.5-square-mile township -- which, like Union City, its neighbor, was noted more as a center for embroidery than shipping -- missed out on the mid-80's construction boom. As other riverfront towns gentrified, North Bergen's chances to boost its declining economic base were stymied by an inadequate road and transportation system. By 1985, the township was basically bankrupt and the state took over its finances.</p>
        <p>BUT since then, North Bergen, which has both modest single-family houses and high-rise towers on the Palisade cliffs, has been trying to turn around its image, both as a place to live and to do business. In the last several years, it has made some strides.</p>
        <p>''It was time for the township to change and to take advantage of the strong economy,'' said Mayor Nicholas J. Sacco, who is also a state senator. But the goal, he said, is that the community rebound in a way that benefits its residents and builds on the distinct character of each of its neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>In the last few years, North Bergen has received $100 million in public money to improve its roads, primarily three overpasses on which work has begun or will begin soon. Projects, representing $200 million in private investment, are also in various stages of development throughout the township that will produce some 800  residences and 500,000 square feet of commercial space, said Joseph R. Auriemma, the township's administrator.</p>
        <p>One completed project is Columbia Park, a 350,000-square-foot retail center that includes a Shop Rite supermarket and a movie theater on 17 acres on Kennedy Boulevard. It replaced a small supermarket, a billiards parlor and the remnants of a failed housing project.</p>
        <p>Plans are advancing for several other projects, including a 300-unit rental complex, which will rise on a full block where an old warehouse now stands. Developers also want to replace a hodgepodge of industrial and commercial uses along a 10-block stretch of Tonnelle Avenue, a main commercial thoroughfare, with big-box retailers such as Lowe's, the hardware chain. And beyond Half Moon Harbour, an assisted-living development for the elderly is being planned for 2.5 acres on the waterfront.</p>
        <p>''Something had to be done on the waterfront,'' Mr. Auriemma said, noting estimates that the Half Moon Harbour project, when completed, will generate slightly more than $1 million in new tax revenue to the township a year.</p>
        <p>Even before Barrett bought the site, there had been opposition to the earlier developer's plan for it, particularly putting up the three 17-story buildings. which objectors said would shrunk the views of Manhattan for people living on the Palisade cliffs. So when his company became interested in the site in 1992, Mr. Barrett said he negotiated with the key objector, the North Bergen Action Group, for the project's current scale. And the township preserved land on the top of the cliffs for a public park.</p>
        <p>But in 1994, neighboring property owners -- the 70-unit Roc Harbor condominium and the smaller Evelyn Estates condominium -- objected to the Barrett plan. The condominiums in several lawsuits contended among other things that the buildings blocked views and would worsen traffic and that Barrett should meet certain obligation unfulfilled by the earlier developer, including providing amenities. They also contested the township's 1997 rezoning of the site. Barrett countersued.</p>
        <p>After four years of litigation the parties hammered out what Joseph Ferriero, a lawyer who represented the condominiums, called a ''good settlement.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Barrett said while the litigation cost his company time and money, the delay could work to the benefit of the project because the waterfront has progressed. As proof he pointed to the thousands of square feet of retail space that has gone up in neighboring Edgewater.</p>
        <p>THE project's first building is nearing completion when, despite a slowing in the state's housing market, there continues to be a demand for waterfront rentals. Lennard Schwartz, who owns Smart Realty in Edgewater, said the demand was coming mainly from young professionals  ''who want views, access to ferry service to Manhattan and new product.''</p>
        <p>But rents ''are starting to stabilize until everyone gets a handle on the impact of the new inventory,'' which will take time to absorb, he said. On average, a typical one-bedroom, 850-square-foot apartment rents for $2,000 a month, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barrett said, and Mr. Schwartz agreed, that Half Moon Harbour was distinct from the mostly low-  and mid-rise riverfront projects now leasing from Weehawken north to Fort Lee and therefore ''not in direct competition.''</p>
        <p>The one-  to three-bedroom apartments in the first building will have 750 to 1,500 square feet of space. There will be 15 different apartment layouts available. To start,  rents will range from $1,600 to $4,700 a month. The first building, like the second, which will have 331 apartments, will be placed at an angle to lessen their impact on neighbors' views from the Palisades and maximize those of tenants.</p>
        <p>Each building will be connected by a causeway to a three-story parking garage. Atop each garage will be the amenities planned for the buildings, including a health club with a swimming pool and one or two tennis courts. There will also be a riverfront walkway, which is a state requirement for all projects within 500 feet of the water's edge.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barrett said the first building would be completed in December. He will start the second building once the first is half rented.</p>
