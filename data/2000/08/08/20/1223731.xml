        <p>Her Infinite Variety</p>
        <p>By Louis Auchincloss.</p>
        <p>Houghton Mifflin, $25.</p>
        <p>Louis Auchincloss's new novel, his first since ''The Education of Oscar Fairfax'' (1995), relates how a Depression-era Vassar graduate named Clara Longcope -- the shrewd and beautiful daughter of a Yale professor -- charms and manipulates her way to the pinnacle of New York society. Throughout ''Her Infinite Variety,'' Auchincloss evokes his signature milieu -- Manhattan's old moneyed elite -- with high-toned allusions to Shakespeare and Shelley. But as Clara marries a blue-blooded heir, lucratively divorces him when her affair with a Kennedyesque politician is exposed, conquers the publishing world by betraying her editor, marries a media mogul and forges ever upward with predatory precision, the novel starts to resemble a soap opera. Auchincloss's clipped insights and occasionally breathless prose allow the melodrama to move along at a swift pace. The characters, who frequently deliver speeches summarizing their socioeconomic positions, feel like deft composites -- most notably Clara's successive husbands. While Clara's daughter, Sandra, an advocate of ''women's lib'' as the book's events come to a close in the 1960's, takes Clara to task for her wiles, Auchincloss would have us see Clara as a gifted, ambitious woman forced to wield her sexuality in the closed world of men. But cliched writing -- as when Clara confesses to her frustrated social-climbing mother: ''I sometimes think you're rotten to the core. . . . I'm beginning to wonder if I'm not a piece of fruit from the same tree'' -- makes Clara seem like merely the shiniest cog in this glittering yet mechanical tale of money, power and changing mores.</p>
