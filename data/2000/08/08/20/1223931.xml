        <p>THE impact Loretta Lynn has had on country music goes beyond style and success. It is about the very foundation of a musical genre that is pure Americana. Ms. Lynn possesses an unadulterated country voice -- a pining, yearning instrument that imparts both vulnerability and strength.</p>
        <p>Her songs are deceptively simple. Sometimes controversial, always candid, they broke ground in the conservative world dominated by Nashville's Music Row. Along the way, Ms. Lynn has become an icon for generations of women.</p>
        <p>On Saturday, Ms. Lynn will perform at the Count Basie Theater in Red Bank, in support of her new album, ''Still Country,'' a fragile, poignant and defiant mix of songs about loss, survival and good-old down-home virtues. Several of the songs deal with the death of her husband, Mooney, while others discuss the state of country music. This is her first solo recording of original material in more than 12 years. Most of the songs were written by outside artists like Randy Scruggs and Vince Gill because, Ms. Lynn said, she was ''sick with the doggone flu for eight days'' unable to write new material.</p>
        <p>''I wanted to show everyone what country music really is,'' said Ms. Lynn, who has just begun a three-month tour, in which she'll be traveling in her custom-made bus. ''All music is based on country music. And that's why so many different kinds of people relate to it. There are more country music fans in New Jersey than there are down South.''</p>
        <p>As Ms. Lynn sings in ''Country in My Genes,'' ''Now country's hit the big time, me I'm still the same, ain't above my raisin', ain't about to change,'' she remains a constant in a business that is in continual flux. Ms. Lynn was so far ahead of her time when she began singing in the early 1960's, many current country singers still hold her as an inspiration. But Ms. Lynn has a mission: ''Keep country music country.'' She gets downright prickly about superstar singers like Shania Twain and Faith Hill.</p>
        <p>''They sing pop songs, they're pop singers,'' Ms. Lynn, the Queen of Country Music, said defiantly about the pair. ''They skip around the ice. I like to break the ice.''</p>
        <p>While Ms. Lynn has had a successful pop hit (the autobiographical ''Coal Miner's Daughter''), she remained a traditionalist after her success. And her life has epitomized the country song: a lifetime of triumph and despair. One of her darkest times was in 1996, when her husband of 48 years died after a long illness. (She was married at 13 and had her first child at 14).</p>
        <p>''Oh, I've been through it all, darlin' '' she said, with a robust laugh.</p>
        <p>One emotional highlight of her new album is ''I Can't Hear the Music.'' An ode to Mooney, who, as he was dying, told Ms. Lynn he was unable to hear when she sang to him. ''He was my biggest critic and my greatest fan. I didn't know he couldn't hear anymore. I thought he didn't want to hear me.</p>
        <p>''I cried and cried when I recorded that song. I can't get myself to perform it in concert yet. Even on the album I made it up-tempo so everyone's not weeping and crying. I'll sing it one day when I'm crazy.'' She added with a laugh, ''As if I'm not crazy already.''</p>
        <p>Her tour's theme is based on another song on her new album, ''On My Own Again.'' Except that is not completely true. Her twins, Peggy and Patsy, a successful country duo known as the Lynns, join her on stage.</p>
        <p>Born in poverty, Ms. Lynn married young (four of her children were born by the time she was 18 and she was a grandmother at 29), fought sexism in the business, lost friends and family to illness and accidents and survived several nervous breakdowns.</p>
        <p>It was her husband who first noticed Ms. Lynn's special talent. After years of hearing her serenade their children, he bought her a guitar. It was not long before she became one of a groundbreaker in contemporary music. She not only wrote her own songs, she wrote songs that confronted issues like drinking, cheating and birth control.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lynn enjoyed a series of No. 1 hits: ''You Ain't Woman Enough to Take My Man,'' ''Don't Come Home Drinkin' With Lovin' On Your Mind,'' ''Fist City,'' ''The Pill,'' ''When the Tingle Become a Chill'' and ''Coal Miner's Daughter''</p>
        <p>She also won awards, including Grammys, and was included in Ladies Home Journal's List of the 10 Most-Admired Women in the World.</p>
        <p>''I once received a lifetime achievement award with some other people and I turned around to one of them and said, 'What did you do?' 'I split the atom,' he said.</p>
        <p>''I thought, 'I must be in the wrong place.' But then I heard them talking about all the things I had done, and I thought, 'I deserve this.' ''</p>
        <p>LORETTA LYNN  Count Basie Theater, 99 Monmouth Street, Red Bank.  Next Saturday at 8 p.m.  (908) 842-9000.</p>
