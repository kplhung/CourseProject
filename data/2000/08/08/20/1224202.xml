        <p>Egad! Three years ago, sprouting black wisps of a toxic mold that has been linked to skin rashes, heart palpitations, respiratory problems, headaches and chronic fatigue were found growing inside the walls and ventilation system of the Tottenville branch of the New York Public Library on Staten Island.</p>
        <p>The building was shut for a year while workers replaced the ventilation system, all the carpeting and upholstery, and the walls in the basement, to rid the building of the poisonous mold.</p>
        <p>The mold, known as Stachybotrys atra, (pronounced stock-ee-BAH-trus AH-tra), thrives in dampness, and Staten Island has a high water table. The library's basement had chronic flooding problems.</p>
        <p>Library books were not affected by the mold, but as a precaution, all of them were removed and cleaned.</p>
        <p>Stachybotrys atra is believed to be particularly dangerous to children. It was suspected in the deaths of eight children who died of bleeding-lung disease several years ago in Cleveland. It has also been connected with sick building syndrome, an array of maladies that involve indoor air pollution.</p>
        <p>One staff member at the Tottenville library suffered respiratory ailments, but no one else was affected, officials said.</p>
        <p>The good news for Staten Island is that the monsoon summer of 2000 has not caused further problems at the library.  The building was renovated and its drainage system repaired during the cleanup, officials said.</p>
