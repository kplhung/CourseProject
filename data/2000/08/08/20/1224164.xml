        <p>Stacy Dragila was always a bit of a daredevil. She competed on the high school rodeo circuit in Northern California and, entering junior college in 1992, became intrigued by the risk and the airborne gymnastics of the pole vault. It was a relatively new event for women, however, and the first male pole-vaulter she consulted suggested she could not clear the gender bar.</p>
        <p>''I asked him if I could try it one day at practice,'' Dragila said. ''He just looked at me and said: 'Women can't do that. They just don't have the upperbody strength. They are not made to do it.' I took it to heart that, O.K., this is one of those things that women just don't do.''</p>
        <p>But at the urging of her coach, Dragila reconsidered in 1993 at Idaho State University. Seven years later, the women's pole vault is among track and field's most engaging events, and Dragila is the world record-holder at 15 feet 2 1/4 inches. She is a gold medal favorite at the 2000 Summer Games, which begin Sept. 15 in Sydney, Australia, where her event will make its Olympic debut for women.</p>
        <p>When the modern Olympics began in 1896, women were not allowed to participate. Times changed, grudgingly but significantly, in the 20th century. In Sydney, more women will compete in more sports, and in more events, than ever. About 4,400 women, or 42 percent of the 10,500 competing athletes, will participate, up from 3,626 at the 1996 Atlanta Games. And for the first time, women will compete in the same number of team sports as men.</p>
        <p>The gains go beyond numbers, however, as women continue to penetrate the boundaries of previously male-only events that require great strength and endurance.</p>
        <p>The sports added for women this year are weight lifting, triathlon, taekwondo and modern pentathlon, and new competitions in multidiscipline sports include water polo in the aquatics category and the hammer throw and pole vault in track and field.</p>
        <p>In effect, Sydney will offer a grand stage for a generation of women who have reaped the benefits of Title IX, followed the lead of individual stars and team champions and carved out an even larger presence for women in the Olympic movement.</p>
        <p>''I think we're worthy of being a medal event at the Olympics,'' Dragila said. ''We've shown we can take it to the next level.''</p>
        <p>She added: ''Girls are starting to come up to me. They are encouraged because they know I came to this so late in my career. They know anything is possible if they put their heart to it.''</p>
        <p>Not only will athletes like Dragila increase the profile of women in the Sydney Games, but the overriding athletic story there will also be a woman's story -- the attempt by Marion Jones of the United States to become the first female track-and-field athlete to win five gold medals in one Olympics. Jones has been heavily marketed and promoted over the last year, and both Jones and Dragila have been featured in television commercials leading up to Sydney. A 17-year-old from the United States, Cheryl Haworth, who is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 308 pounds, is a gold medal favorite in weight lifting.</p>
        <p>It is clear that Olympic officials and sponsors are paying more attention to female athletes, especially after last summer's Women's World Cup of soccer -- the largest sporting event ever for women -- filled up large stadiums in the United States and ended any doubt that people in large numbers would pay to watch women play team sports.</p>
        <p>''The soccer team showed that, a generation after Title IX, women's sports are here to stay,'' said Maureen O'Toole, who is considered the greatest female water polo player ever and who will make her initial Olympic appearance in Sydney at age 39.</p>
        <p>Stung by criticism that the gold medal success of American women in softball and soccer was reduced to highlight footage at the Atlanta Olympics, NBC, which will pay $3.5 billion to broadcast the next five Olympic Games, will show every minute of the women's soccer and softball matches on network or cable.</p>
        <p>Even though he has been battered recently by scandals involving corruption and performance-enhancing drugs, the president of the International Olympic Committee, Juan Antonio Samaranch, can include as one of his greatest successes the increased participation of women as athletes and officials in the Olympic movement.</p>
        <p>He named the first female member of the I.O.C. in 1981; today 13 of the 113 delegates are women. Four years ago, Samaranch proposed that women should hold at least 10 percent of the decision-making positions in the I.O.C., every national Olympic committee and international sports federations by 2000, with the number rising to 20 percent by 2005. These goals may seem meager by American standards, but they represent significant progress in many countries where women's roles are diminished or dismissed for cultural and religious reasons.</p>
        <p>''We appointed women I.O.C. members for the first time and we solved a very important problem, the participation of women in the Games,'' Samaranch said in a recent interview. ''But we still have a problem; that is, the presence of women in leading positions running sport.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, women have hardly reached a level of parity with men in the Olympic movement. Forty-eight names were proposed recently for 14 new positions as I.O.C. members, and none of them were women.</p>
        <p>Validation in Water Polo</p>
        <p>Opportunities are coming more quickly on the playing fields, on the track and in the pool. O'Toole will finally have a chance to display before a worldwide audience her seminal skills in women's water polo. After playing internationally since 1978, she retired in 1994 to teach physical education and coach in Northern California, believing her career would never have the validation of the Olympics.</p>
        <p>She would apparently have to be satisfied with decades of success achieved in anonymity, when the American team slept on pool tables in a bar in the Netherlands and traveled from Italy to Malta on a fishing trawler because there was no money for more extravagant travel. The entire team bunked at her house during summer training in the early days, and pool time was limited for female players to 6 to 9 in the morning and 8 to 11 at night.</p>
        <p>When women's water polo was added to the Sydney schedule in 1997, O'Toole quickly came out of retirement. Still, there is no big money in the sport. Even with a training stipend from the United States Olympic Committee and a pair of sponsors, she has struggled to make ends meet.</p>
        <p>For a year, O'Toole has lived with her mother in Huntington Beach, Calif., to train with the American team and has traveled home to the Bay Area to see her 8-year-old daughter, Kelly, and her boyfriend on the weekends.</p>
        <p>''The first world championship was in '78 in Berlin, but it was only a demonstration sport, not official,'' O'Toole said. ''They had no hotel rooms for us. We had to sit around the lobby for three or four hours. It was almost embarrassing. We worked as hard as other athletes and put the same amount of time in, but we weren't an Olympic sport, so no one cared about us. Being an Olympic sport makes a difference. It really validates us.''</p>
        <p>The Honeymoon Can Wait</p>
        <p>As she watched American women achieve thorough success at the Atlanta Games, Jennifer Gutierrez of Denver said she never dreamed she would compete in Sydney in the inaugural Olympic triathlon, which will include a one-mile swim, a 24-mile bike ride and a 6.2-mile run. A former champion swimmer at Pepperdine University, Gutierrez took up the triathlon for fitness training in 1994.</p>
        <p>Early success, and the realization that the sport would be included in the Sydney Olympics, encouraged Gutierrez to increase her training from 15 to 25 hours a week, which she has fit in around her job teaching physical education to handicapped children.</p>
        <p>She swims from 5:30 to 7:30 each morning, runs six miles on her lunch break and bikes in the evening. She postponed her honeymoon for two years until the completion of the Summer Games.</p>
        <p>''Having your sport in the Olympics raises the whole level of competition,'' said Gutierrez, 33. ''You make sacrifices you wouldn't make in everyday life to get to the Olympics. It's really hard to get up every morning and get yourself in the water.</p>
        <p>''I love art, I love going out with friends and to the movies. I've had to cut a lot of that out. I still haven't taken my honeymoon. But now I know what it takes to be an athlete at a high level. I can appreciate the effort of these athletes, whether they are in first place or last.''</p>
        <p>Hammer Thrower's Pursuit</p>
        <p>Dawn Ellerbe, a native of Brooklyn who has been over 6 feet tall since the eighth grade, threw the shot-put and discus at Central Islip High on Long Island, and then reluctantly attempted the hammer throw at the University of South Carolina. The first time she grabbed the nine-pound ball by its 3-foot-long wire, spun several times and launched the hammer, she fell down.</p>
        <p>She has ruined more than a few suitcases, traveling with four or five of the hammers to each meet, and has had to shovel snow off the hammer-throwing ring to train at the University of Wyoming, where she received her master's degree in communications and is now an assistant coach. But her perseverance has paid off. At 26, the 6-foot-2-inch, 240-pound Ellerbe has won five national championships in the hammer throw, has set the American record of 231 feet 2 inches and has established herself as a medal candidate in Sydney. Her event and others will provide girls with a chance to see mature women competing, Ellerbe noted, in contrast to the prepubescent images of gymnasts and figure skaters frequently broadcast at the Summer and Winter Games.</p>
        <p>''Everyone seems to be getting excited about women in sports,'' she said. ''It's been a long time coming. When younger girls see a gymnast or an ice skater, they think it's a fantasy: 'I can't do that after I'm 22.' I think this will show them that you can be a scholar, too.''</p>
        <p>Mastering the Pole Vault</p>
        <p>The most popular of the new Olympic events for women is the pole vault. It is an evolving sport, and thus a world record is possible at every major competition. The pole vault also evokes danger, strength and acrobatic grace as women plant a 14-foot pole and invert themselves in midair to clear a bar.</p>
        <p>''Being a little bit sexist, you've got good-looking girls and an X Games mentality,'' said Dave Nielsen, who coaches Dragila in Pocatello, Idaho. A former vaulter, he began trying to get women interested in the pole vault in hopes that gender equity could stem the erosion of the event because of the expense, the threat of injury, rising insurance costs and lawsuits.</p>
        <p>''Having women involved would be leverage to keep the event,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Dragila, 29, grew up in Auburn, Calif., and competed in goat-tying competitions in high school rodeos, dismounting from her horse, flipping the goat and binding its legs with rope. She was recruited to college as a heptathlete, the female version of the decathlon, which requires skill in running, throwing and jumping. The pole vault was something that few women had ever tried, and Dragila started gingerly at a height of 6 feet, a full 10 inches below the women's world record in the high jump.</p>
        <p>''I wouldn't call it pole-vaulting, just holding on for dear life and getting over the bar,'' Dragila said. ''Getting on the runway in '93 was very awkward. Trying to hold the pole, run with it and plant it in this stupid little box, then trying to jump off the ground and turn yourself over was very frightening.''</p>
        <p>Being in the air was disorienting, she said, and she was never sure if she was going to land on her back, her feet or her neck. So she began training at a gymnastics school to gain awareness of her body in the air. A year later, she improved to 10 feet. Last summer, the 5-7, 140-pound Dragila won the inaugural world championship for women, clearing 15-1. She believes a 17-foot jump for women is possible, and would be the equivalent of a 20-foot jump for men, who possess more speed and upper-body strength.</p>
        <p>Dragila has also generated attention by posing nude with other American women for a track-and-field calendar, saying it is a sign of progress that women are confident enough in their bodies to expose them as figures of strength and power instead of titillation. Other athletes, officials and feminists disagree, saying women are still conforming to societal pressure to prove that they are feminine when they sweat.</p>
        <p>Despite the popularity of the event, female vaulters are still trying to clear the bar of equality. When Dragila won the 1999 world championship last August in Seville, Spain, tying what was then the world record, she received only half the $60,000 prize money available to male vaulters. Looking ahead to Sydney, she said, ''I hope we don't get half a medal.''</p>
