        <p>The new what? Most Americans have heard of the Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq index, but surprisingly few have heard or read about the new economy, according to a recent survey by Scudder Kemper Investments.</p>
        <p>Among people who said they knew what the phrase ''new economy'' meant, only 28 percent cited the ''high-tech economy'' or ''high-tech stocks.'' A majority (61 percent) said that they found talk of dot-com companies to be confusing. The crankiest ones (38 percent) reported being fed up with hearing about technology and Internet companies.</p>
        <p>''The dot-com revolution has inevitably led to more content and commentary about investing, and at increasing levels of detail and sophistication,'' said Joan Cannon Wood, senior vice president for Scudder Kemper Investments in Boston. ''But the majority of Americans said that there's too much hype coming at them about the new economy, and many people are confused.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, the survey results show conflicting attitudes. While respondents expressed an overall cautious optimism about the economy as a whole and confidence in the long-term prospects of Internet companies and the ''dot-com revolution,'' they were generally reluctant to invest in those companies.</p>
        <p>Even so, the dot-com hype has created sky-high expectations among the respondents as to what returns can reasonably be expected on investments. The average return considered reasonable today is 21.7 percent. That is slightly more than the 20 percent return of the stocks in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index over the last seven years, but nearly double the annual average return on equities of 12.1 percent from 1926 to 1990, according to Ibbotson Associates in Chicago.</p>
        <p>The survey, conducted from April 18 through May 1, was based on 1,300 telephone interviews of randomly selected people over the age of 18.</p>
