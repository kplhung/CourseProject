        <p>The Scouts' ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy does not lead to witch-hunts to ferret out presumed homosexuals. It is only when an individual flaunts his homosexuality that the Scouts see a need to insulate impressionable youngsters from such role models.</p>
        <p>The scouts are to be commended for enforcing a policy that -- while ignoring the sexual orientation and private behavior of its members and leaders -- has zero tolerance for those whose comportment is deemed not to conform to its standards, regardless whether that undesirable behavior assumes homosexual or heterosexual expression.</p>

        <p>A list of organizations authorized to meet in Huntington schools, obtained on the day after the public meeting at which a final decision was ostensibly deferred, shows that the Boy Scouts are no longer on it. Sixty-five other organizations are.</p>
        <p>By not allowing the scouts to meet until the issues are resolved, the Huntington school board has already made its decision, despite claims to the contrary. The Huntington board's autocratic behavior is once again far from the best interests of Huntington's taxpayers and parents.</p>
