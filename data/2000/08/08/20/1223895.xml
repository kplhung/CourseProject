        <p>UBS Warburg, the American division of UBS A.G., Europe's third-largest bank, has begun building an addition to the downtown Stamford building it completed in 1997, when it was known as the Swiss Bank Corporation.</p>
        <p>The $100 million project will add 338,000 square feet to the building, enlarging it to 910,000 square feet. Completion is scheduled for 2002.</p>
        <p>Future additions are expected to bring the total space to the 1.35 million square feet allowed by the zoning.</p>
        <p>In 1994, Connecticut clinched Swiss Bank's move to Stamford from Manhattan by providing $120 million in tax credits, but under the terms of the agreement the package was withdrawn when the bank merged into Warburg Dillon Read and subsequently UBS Warburg.</p>
        <p>Last month, the state restructured the package as $46 million in forgivable loans, contingent on maintaining current job levels and increasing them with each building addition to at least 5,000 jobs.</p>
        <p>''We made a bold decision in 1994 to build our business in Stamford,'' said John Costas, chief operating officer, ''because we believed it would provide a superior quality of life for our employees and a cutting-edge platform for our Unites States growth.''</p>
        <p>Designed by Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill and being built by Turner Construction, who designed and built the existing rose-beige brick and glass structure, the expansion will enlarge an already spectacular trading floor by 36,000 square feet, to 103,000 square feet, making it the world's largest. Its ceiling, supported by nine bow trusses, arcs from 35 feet to 45 feet over a column-free trading floor.</p>
        <p>Five hundred employees will be added to the current 3,000, with 1,150 of the total working as securities trading personnel, up from the current 800. ''All our trading engines will be here,'' Mr. Costas said. ''It would take years to replicate this in the city, if you could.''</p>
        <p>New construction includes 36,000 square feet for technical operations, and a 7-floor, 266,000-square-foot mechanical area and garage for 500 cars, increasing parking to 1,900 spaces.</p>
        <p>UBS now has a 13-story office tower and 7-story central building on a 12.2-acre site at 677 Washington Boulevard, just north of Interstate 95 between the railroad station and the central business district.</p>
        <p>As Stamford's largest taxpayer, it pays the city $4.11 million annually in real estate and personal property taxes, or double the amount of the runner-up, Equity Office Properties, a Chicago-based company that pays $2.17 million.</p>
