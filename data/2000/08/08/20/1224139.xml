      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Carmen Policy was president of the San Francisco 49ers from 1991 to 1999, and during that period the team captured Super Bowl XXIX and never won fewer than 10 games. Policy was considered a genius by many, able to massage the salary cap without breaking a sweat, and he quickly became one of the highest-profile executives in the sport. When his competitors whispered that he was bending the rules, those words were often ignored as jealous ramblings.</p>
        <p>Policy is now running the Cleveland Browns, and depending on whom you believe, either his past has finally caught him or he is enduring one of the worst witch hunts of all time.</p>
        <p>According to team and league officials, the National Football League's management council is close to finishing its more than yearlong investigation into whether Policy and the 49ers violated salary-cap rules with contracts involving the former tight end Brent Jones and the former quarterbacks Steve Young and Jim Druckenmiller. The council, according to those people, will most likely conclude that there is sufficient evidence to believe that serious violations did occur during Policy's reign, specifically during the 1997 season, when the 49ers reached the National Football Conference title game.</p>
        <p>In an interview, Policy defended his actions in San Francisco, insisting he did nothing wrong, and hinting that the accusations, in part, are a result of jealousy from other owners who were constantly beaten by the 49ers under his reign. Policy compared the investigation of him to that of President Clinton by Kenneth W. Starr, the former independent counsel.</p>
        <p>''There is a fine line in the N.F.L. between jealousy and focused competitiveness,'' Policy said last week. ''I have tremendous respect for most of the owners in the league, but on Sunday, if I lose to them, I don't like them very much. If you take my situation when I was with the 49ers, we won a lot. So multiply those feelings I was talking about, and all those victories we had, those playoff wins, the five Super Bowl appearances, and there is a subconscious delight in watching a competitor get taken down a little bit.''</p>
        <p>If the management council -- which in these cases acts like the prosecution in a criminal trial -- determines that Policy did violate salary-cap guidelines, the council will try to negotiate a settlement with Policy and others involved.</p>
        <p>If there was no settlement, the case would be turned over to a special master. If that person determined Policy had violated the rules, it would be up to Commissioner Paul Tagliabue to decide punishment. The 49ers might lose a first-round draft pick while Policy could be fined or suspended. The management council is also investigating Dwight Clark, who worked in the front office under Policy in San Francisco and followed him to Cleveland, as well as the agents for Young and Druckenmiller.</p>
        <p>Whatever happens, Policy seems primed for a long fight. ''The management council has been extremely intrusive,'' he said. ''The documents they have requested have been numerous; there have been a number of witnesses and depositions. It has been relentless. They've been more thorough than Ken Starr was during his days in the sun.</p>
        <p>''They want an acceptable conclusion, as do I. But I refuse to agree to any settlement that would send the wrong message. I do not feel that I personally did anything wrong.''</p>
        <p>There is conflicting information as to what kind of discipline -- if the accusations are proven true -- Tagliabue would be able to levy against Policy. The N.F.L. believes it could suspend Policy, if that was deemed appropriate, under the large umbrella of conduct detrimental to the league. However, the collective bargaining agreement says that if a special master rules against Policy, the only punishment allowed is a maximum fine of $250,000.</p>
        <p>When asked if he thought things could get nasty between himself and the N.F.L., Policy said: ''I'll do everything possible to make sure that does not happen. But like everything else, if this ever reaches the stage where there is litigation, when you put it in that environment, you don't have warm and fuzzy feelings.''</p>
        <p>The N.F.L. had no comment.</p>
        <p>According to team and league officials, at least one owner has asked high-ranking N.F.L. officials, including Tagliabue, to kick Policy out of the league for good. Still other owners have said that Policy should be suspended for at least one year.</p>
        <p>''The owners who are saying I should be severely punished are basing those comments on what they hear, not the facts,'' Policy said.</p>
        <p>Policy's defenders insist he has never broken the rules, and the reason he is being investigated is that he was so successful. His supporters also point out that none of the Super Bowl years are involved.</p>
        <p>Many in the N.F.L. consider salary-cap violations to be almost as big a threat to competitive balance as drugs or gambling. That is definitely not a stretch. If one team can pay players under the table to get around salary-cap rules, while all others are abiding by the guidelines, the cheating team can win faster and keep that winning team together longer.</p>
        <p>According to team officials, there are several issues in the 49ers case.</p>
        <p>*The N.F.L. says that Druckenmiller's original San Francisco contract contained a fictitious year added on for salary-cap purposes. The N.F.L. believes that by adding that extra year, the 49ers got more cap room. Policy said that because of the investigation he could not get into specifics but that Druckenmiller's deal was legitimate.</p>
        <p>*Young, the N.F.L. maintains, took a reduction in salary to help the 49ers sign Druckenmiller; he was promised that the money would be given back the following the year, and he got it back. The collective bargaining agreement bans undisclosed agreements, promises or understandings of any kind involving salary that are not disclosed to the league. Policy said the management council examined Young's contract at the time and approved it.</p>
        <p>*Jones went back to the team seeking a payment believed to be between $500,000 and $1 million he said was owed to him. Jones says the payment was promised to him after retirement for ''other services.'' The N.F.L. believes Jones performed no services and the payment was really for playing. Policy said he did everything by the rules.</p>
        <p>Policy said his main concern is for the reputation of the 49ers. ''I have no love for the people running the organization now,'' Policy said of the York family, which now controls the team. ''But I will always be loyal to that franchise.''</p>
        <p>Lapses in Jets' Tempers</p>
        <p>Now that Bill Parcells -- the grumpy he-says-jump-players-say-how-high Parcells -- is no longer coaching the team, do players feel as if they get away with more?</p>
        <p>The former Jets wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson said in an interview that earlier this preseason, quarterback Vinny Testaverde got into a heated argument with one of the offensive coaches. Johnson stays in regular contact with many of the Jets players and coaches. The team said it had no comment.</p>
        <p>Last week linebacker Bryan Cox and the defensive line coach Ray Hamilton got into a profanity-laced argument during practice.</p>
        <p>Would these incidents have happened under Parcells? Jets players say arguments between coaches and players have happened before, even under Parcells, and are a part of football.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, do players need an imposing personality to keep them in check?</p>
        <p>Based on the past, at least when it comes to Parcells, the answer may be yes. Giants players had little respect for the soft-spoken Ray Handley when he replaced Parcells, and the laid-back Pete Carroll was all but ignored by most New England players after following Parcells.</p>
        <p>Around the League</p>
        <p>In Pittsburgh, the former Giants quarterback Kent Graham is having a better training camp than the starter, Kordell Stewart. In three games, Stewart has a 43.9 passer rating. . . . The new XFL has received 15,000 applications from players. . . . After the Cleveland backup quarterback Ty Detmer, a hunter, had his torn Achilles' tendon operated on last week, one of the first things Detmer asked doctors was, ''How long are those deer safe in Texas?'' Detmer will be out the entire season.</p>
