        <p>CONNECTICUT has its share of historic Revolutionary War sites, some well marked, others hidden in dense brush. Then there are the stories -- some the stuff of pure legend, some well documented and others someplace in between.</p>
        <p>Today, it's become a popular pastime to search out sites linked to George Washington, his troops and the famous French general, Comte Rochambeau, who made their way across the state and back as the colonists fought for independence from Britain</p>
        <p>For example, Florence Crowell, Watertown's town historian, had heard there was a Revolutionary War site in Middlebury, so she set off in quest of it recently, accompanied by her husband, Livingston, and armed with clippers.</p>
        <p>''Breakneck Hill is off Artillery Road in Middlebury,'' she said. ''Rochambeau was to have camped there on his march through Connecticut. So we went looking for the monument, but we would never have found it if someone hadn't come along and showed us.''</p>
        <p>The story, she said, was that Rochambeau had oxen drag supplies up the mountain until one fell and broke his neck. The area was called Breakneck Hill after the incident, but the site and monument had long ago been covered in brush and brambles.</p>
        <p>''If you could have seen two 77-year-olds out there with clippers, you would've thought we needed our heads examined,'' Mrs. Crowell said, ''but we made it.''</p>
        <p>Now that the Crowells have cleared a path, maybe others will follow. If they do, they will find a plaque at the site, secured on a large chunk of granite, that announces, ''The Camp of the French Army en route to Yorktown, June 27, 1781.''</p>
        <p>More ambitious projects are under way in other towns. Hans DePold of Bolton has been behind a movement to acquire the property in his town where Rochambeau camped. Mr. DePold said the farmer who owned the property now, Richard Rose, would continue there for two years until his cattle are sold.</p>
        <p>''A lot of people camped there, or passed through,'' Mr. DePold said. ''We know Rochambeau was there, and Lafayette went by five times. General Barnum led the Continental troops to Rhode Island by this place also.''</p>
        <p>The land in Bolton covers 100 acres, 20 to 30 of which were part of the original encampment. Mr. DePold said that there are a variety of ideas for using the property, 88 acres of which must be maintained as open space.''</p>
        <p>The property could become the site for a historical museum or a monument to Revolutionary War soldiers or provide a place for re-enactments -- somewhere that would not spoil the archaeological integrity of the original site. The decision will come from a town meeting.</p>
        <p>Representative John Larson, a 1st District Democrat, introduced a bill last month that would underwrite a study of the route and significant sites along the way. It took the army -- 6,000 French, Polish, German and Irish soldiers -- a year to gather in Newport and prepare for the march. In June 1781, the troops began the trek on what is now known as the Washington-Rochambeau Revolutionary Route.</p>
        <p>The plan is to restore the route, with important encampments, so people can follow it. As a step toward making it a state trail, archaeologists from the University of Connecticut in Storrs were hired in 1998, Mr. DePold said.</p>
        <p>''We know that the troops arrived in Newport, from where some marched and some sailed,'' he said. ''They traveled south through Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland and Virginia. They marched back on the same route to Providence and headed diagonally across to Boston, so Massachusetts should be included as one of the states.''</p>
        <p>The troops traveled a little over 600 miles, and for about 400 miles the French and American armies marched together, Mr. DePold said.  They went to Plainfield, Sterling Hall, Andover, Bolton, Hartford, Southington, Middlebury, Danbury and Ridgefield.</p>
        <p>''They marched in a single column until Lebanon, and then the Duke de Lauzan took the cavalry in a parallel march along the coast, traveling through Oxford, Middlebury and Stratford,'' Mr. DePold said. ''There are lots of stories about the French that confuse people, probably because there were 800 men and horses in the cavalry, escorted by 100 artillery people. They joined the other troops in New York again.''</p>
        <p>Mr. DePold said that as Bolton's municipal historian he became particularly interested in Revolutionary War history about five years ago when he discovered how much information there was and how incorrect much of it was.</p>
        <p>''The French didn't stay behind the lines,'' he said. ''We couldn't have stopped the British without aid.''</p>
        <p>Another important site along the Washington-Rochambeau route is Lebanon, home of Connecticut's longest green. That is where the French camped en route to Yorktown, where the British general Cornwallis surrendered. Around the green are historic buildings such as the Wadsworth Stable, (where Washington's horse might have spent the night), a broom shop, the site of a French oven where the French troops cooked their meals during an eight-month stay, Gov. Jonathan Trumbull's house, a Revolutionary War office, the Jonathan Trumbull Jr. House, and an expansive new museum that features many aspects of Lebanon history. Just off the green are three Colonial burying grounds.</p>
        <p>''The story of the Revolution and Colonial time is told by all the properties on the green,'' said Joyce Okonuk, the town's first selectman.</p>
        <p>Plans to document and restore the route of the Washington-Rochambeau march are intended to recognize the significance of both Washington and Rochambeau in the fight for independence. But the war had a lasting impact on many other areas, some less well known than the Washington-Rochambeau route.</p>
        <p>The Continental Congress appointed Washington commander of the Continental Army in 1775, and on July 4, 1776, Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence. It was not until 1781 that French troops began their march ending in Cornwallis's defeat. In the intervening years, Washington crisscrossed Connecticut, while loyalists and patriots chose sides.</p>
        <p>William C. Bader, the town historian for Washington, Conn., says that Revolutionary era history is part oral history, part documented reports. The old Cogswell Tavern, near New Preston, is where Washington reputedly heard about Benedict Arnold's betrayal, prompting an ungentlemanly display of rage. Nearby, the Romford Road area was known to be a holdout for Tories. Patriots from Washington Green decided to ''go over and clean them out,'' Mr. Bader said. ''One patriot's gun discharged, killing another, and the whole deal was off.''</p>
        <p>A more public event was a meeting in Gaylordsville, on what is now Route 7 along the Housatonic, where Washington held council with his troops in 1780. This meeting is mentioned in his diary, and the Daughters of the American Revolution has cared for the large white oak that stood there then and still does.</p>
        <p>In nearby New Milford, Washington is known to have stopped at a farmhouse where the people gave him food and hard cider. He passed it around to his men, raised his cup and said, ''Merry all!'' The rural area has since been known as Merryall, Mr. Bader said.</p>
        <p>Many neighborhoods boast their own Washington tale -- whether it is documented or fabricated seems to be of little import. Connecticut was host to a lengthy series of encampments, marches, meetings called by both Washington and Rochambeau, as well as secret intrigues, and all of it is part of the fabric that makes up the story of the Revolutionary War in Connecticut. Cutting paths to monuments and dedicating the route of the march are ways to bring these events to the forefront in time for the 225th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence in July 2001.</p>
