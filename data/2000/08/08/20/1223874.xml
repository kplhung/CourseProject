        <p>THE blues guitar legend B.B. King had only two words to explain why his latest single ''Riding With the King'' has become such a hit: ''Eric Clapton.''</p>
        <p>True, Mr. Clapton sings and plays guitar on the song, which has cruised on the popular radio airwaves since June without any sign of yielding to other traffic. Truer still is that younger audiences may recognize Mr. Clapton, whose music videos get lots of play on VH1 and MTV. Still, Mr. King surely has something to do with his recent resurgence.</p>
        <p>''I mean it,'' said Mr. King, who will perform with Buddy Guy, James Montgomery and others at the Ives Concert Parks Blues Festival in Danbury on Sept. 4. ''It's Eric, he's the one who made it happen. I thank God every day for Eric Clapton.''</p>
        <p>Mr. King's unassuming manner explains why he attracts other blues musicians like moths to a porch light. While he may be best known for the song ''The Thrill Is Gone,'' Mr. King is also known for his performances with such luminaries as Etta James, Albert Collins, John Lee Hooker, Bonnie Raitt and Robert Cray. He has also teamed up with rockers like the Rolling Stones, Joe Walsh and U2. Mr. King is quick to acknowledge the benefits of such associations for himself. ''When I went out with the Rolling Stones they introduced me to a whole new audience,'' said Mr. King from -- where else? -- the road. ''The same thing happened with U2. Then when I go out with my band, it's not unusual to see the younger fans out front. I'm grateful to these groups for that.</p>
        <p>''The thing is, I always hear the word resurgence,'' he said. ''There's no resurgence. I haven't stopped.''</p>
        <p>Not in more than 50 years. Mr. King has been famous for averaging well over 300 dates a year. (''I cut down to about 220,'' he said, ''I'm going to be 75 soon.'') Since establishing himself in the late 1940's on Beale Street in Memphis, Mr. King has inspired virtually all subsequent guitarists, Mr. Clapton included.</p>
        <p>Mr. King, himself influenced by T-Bone Walker and Lonnie Johnson, hitchhiked to Memphis from his home in Indianola, Miss., in 1946. Mr. King started his career as a disc jockey on WDIA, Memphis' first black radio station.</p>
        <p>''Memphis was quite different back then,'' he said. ''It was still segregated. Beale Street was blooming. There were lots of little clubs playing the best music around. As a D.J. of the only all-black radio station, I got to rub elbows with all the greats coming through town. Sonny Boy Williamson, Basie, Lowell Folson. There was always good music after work.''</p>
        <p>By 1948, Mr. King was recording his own music with Bullet Records in Nashville. ''We recorded it right in my radio station,'' he said. ''Of course, nobody heard it. The next year, I met a young Ike Turner, who scouted for Bihari Brothers. They owned RPM Records. I cut all my singles on their Crown label.''</p>
        <p>What distinguishes Mr. King as a blues guitarist is his bridging of the raw, Chicago 12-bar blues with the cooler, more precise style personified by T-Bone Walker. Mr. King's single-string feathering of notes makes his guitar sing. Besides Walker, Mr. King credits Johnson and Roy Brown with his lean, ''talking'' effect.</p>
        <p>''I never intended to create my own style, it evolved,'' he said. ''I tried to play like everybody else, which I couldn't do. So like the fox who couldn't reach the grapes up in the tree, I said, 'never mind the way they play; I'll do it my way and it'll be better.' That's when I learned that I couldn't be somebody else. I had to just be B.B. King.''</p>
        <p>B.B. King performs at the Ives Concert Parks Blues Festival on Sept. 4 with Buddy Guy, James Montgomery, the New England Blues All-Stars, Jeff Pitchell and Texas Flood, Jerry Joseph, 9 Volt Blues Band, Dan Aldrich and Paul Gabriel and Blue in the Face Duo at Ives Concert Park, Mill Plain Road, Danbury. Gates open at 2 p.m. Music starts at 3 p.m. Tickets for reserved seating are $10 to $60. The numbers to call for further information are (203) 744-8100 or (203) 624-0033.</p>
