        <p>THE DARK HOUSE</p>
        <p>By John Sedgwick.</p>
        <p>HarperCollins, $25.</p>
        <p>Until he falls back on convention, the journalist John Sedgwick has written an inventive and original first novel. Edward Rollins, the protagonist, is the product of one of Boston's more prominent families. He is also, it happens, a sociopath, able to deal with others in only the most cursory of ways, his favorite being a peculiar but usually harmless hobby that involves following the cars of strangers to their destinations. When he follows an Audi to a town north of Boston and watches the driver enter a darkened house, he finds himself caught up in the thrall of an enigma when nothing else happens: no lights, no noise, no movement. Rollins, who toils at a minor job at a large investment firm, now finds himself living in another's scenario, and in an unexpected involvement with Marj, a young colleague who somehow finds him engaging. Gradually, Rollins discovers that this mystery somehow involves members of his own family: his chilly mother, his distant father and even Neely, a female cousin who disappeared under suspicious circumstances. Untangling all this starts him on the road back to the world where most of the rest of us live, but unfortunately for the novel, as Rollins is transformed into a more customary sort of mystery hero, the book becomes a more customary sort of mystery, complete with car chases, bodies and stakeouts. It's almost too bad that Rollins eventually gets straightened out; his earlier strangeness might have made for a pretty dazzling character.</p>
