        <p>INVESTORS who are awaiting the initial public offering of Coach Inc., the luxury leather goods maker, are likely to be disappointed, analysts warn, because Coach's parent, the Sara Lee Corporation, might well do better if it sells the unit than if it takes it public.</p>
        <p>Sara Lee reached a similar conclusion last week when it agreed to sell its PYA/Monarch food service unit to Koninklijke Ahold N.V., the Dutch supermarket giant, for $1.57 billion.

        <p>INVESTORS who are awaiting the initial public offering of Coach Inc., the luxury leather goods maker, are likely to be disappointed, analysts warn, because Coach's parent, the Sara Lee Corporation, might well do better if it sells the unit than if it takes it public.</p>
        <p>Sara Lee reached a similar conclusion last week when it agreed to sell its PYA/Monarch food service unit to Koninklijke Ahold N.V., the Dutch supermarket giant, for $1.57 billion. In June, PYA/Monarch filed with the Securities and Exchange Corporation to raise $160 million in an initial offering to be managed by Goldman Sachs, Bear Stearns and Salomon Smith Barney.</p>
        <p>In each case, Sara Lee intended initially to keep 80 percent of the company and offer 20 percent to the public.</p>
        <p>''With the direct sale of PYA/Monarch to Ahold, Sara Lee obtains cash now, eliminates market uncertainty and secures a multiyear supply contract, creating significant value for Sara Lee shareholders,'' said C. Steven McMillan, chief executive of Sara Lee.</p>
        <p>Mr. McMillan was the architect of the company's plan to sell some assets and focus on its core businesses. Though it is best known for its baked goods, Sara Lee also owns brands including Ball Park franks, L'eggs hosiery, Hanes underwear, Wonderbra, Endust furniture cleaner and Kiwi shoe polish.</p>
        <p>A Sara Lee spokeswoman, Julie Ketay, said after the PYA/Monarch deal that the $140 million Coach offering, to be managed by Goldman Sachs, was still on track to be completed by the end of the year, but some fund managers and analysts are not convinced.</p>
        <p>LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the French luxury goods group, is among the many names being tossed up as potential buyers of Coach. Last year LVMH teamed up with its archrival Prada S.p.A. to win a bidding war with the Gucci Group for another high-class brand, Fendi, the Italian apparel and accessories group. They paid one trillion lire, or $483.6 million, for a 51 percent stake in Fendi.</p>
        <p>''For some reason, the market will put a higher multiple on the same business with the same earnings if Bernard Arnault owned this company,'' said Greg Fontana, vice president and co-manager for the John Hancock funds in Boston, referring to the LVMH chairman.</p>
        <p>PEDRO BERNAL, an analyst at Wachovia Securities in Charlotte, N.C., said: ''The most likely choice is for it to be sold than to do an I.P.O. Just about everybody has been mentioned, so it's not a question of who, but what price.''</p>
        <p>To be sure, some fashion stocks have performed poorly, like Donna Karan International and Tommy Hilfiger. But those with expanded product lines like jewelry, shoes and handbags, have proved that pricey baubles have a place on Wall Street. Coach, with sales of $507 million in the fiscal year ended July 3, 1999, according to its prospectus, may be aiming for a valuation akin to that of Kenneth Cole, the shoe designer that also makes handbags and accessories, analysts say. Kenneth Cole, which has seen its shares jump to $45.3125, from below $10 a share in 1998, has a market capitalization of $925.05 million.</p>
        <p>Jeffrey Kanter, an analyst at Prudential Securities, said Coach had plenty of momentum behind it. ''It's bouncing back from a difficult environment over the past few years where Asia reduced their purchasing power,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Sales grew at a compounded annual rate of 32 percent a year, to $540.4 million in 1997, from $19 million in 1985 when Sara Lee acquired the family-owned business, only to slide as a result of Asia's financial crisis. Sales dipped 3.4 percent in 1998 and 2.8 percent in 1999 but are now starting to recover.</p>
        <p>The company, which has 106 American retail stores, hopes to rebound with an ambitious plan to open 50 new stores in the next three years, remodel existing ones and expand its international presence. Similar strategies helped fatten revenue for Tiffany, Gucci , and LVMH, all of which have expanded their product lines to attract upper middle-class shoppers -- those that have fared so well in today's economy.</p>
        <p>Coach, which also sells through several catalogs and 63 factory outlets, sees big growth opportunities in Japan, where consumers spend substantially more for handbags than in the United States. The company has a fashionably modern Web site and is branching into products for the home, like leather director's chairs, and even into pet supplies, from collars to beds. But analysts caution that fashion trends change quickly in high-end luxury goods.</p>
        <p>If there is an initial offering, Coach could gain points because, unlike many others going public, it is profitable. In the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2000, Coach's net income jumped 67 percent, to $32.3 million, as sales rose 9.7 percent, to $427.2 million, according to its S.E.C. filing.</p>
        <p>Proceeds from the initial offering would be used to repay a portion of debt to Sara Lee. Coach also plans to enter into a revolving credit facility with Sara Lee under which it may borrow up to $75 million. (It expects to borrow about $50 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2001.)</p>
        <p>Within 18 months of the initial offering, Sara Lee plans to sell its 80.1 percent stake in Coach. Sara Lee also plans to shed Champion sportswear, with $500 million in annual sales, and its recently acquired International Fabrics division of the British retailer Courtaulds Textiles, with $400 million in sales.</p>
        <p>In announcing the divestiture plans, Mr. McMillan said that the sales would bring in at least $2.5 billion, giving the company enough cash to buy other companies that fit better with the brands it is keeping.</p>
        <p>''Steve McMillan will spend the peak of his career disassembling the conglomerate that he built,'' said Mr. Fontana, at John Hancock funds. ''I don't believe conglomerates make sense unless you're Jack Welch.''</p>
