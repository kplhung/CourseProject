        <p>IN the view of Huntington Town officials, the Suffolk County Legislature is engaged in petty politics. But Suffolk lawmakers contend they are only trying to entice the town to address the crucial issue of affordable housing.</p>
        <p>At issue is whether the county should have a direct say in the development of a 382-acre site in Melville that was the home of the Long Island Developmental Center, a state psychiatric hospital for children.</p>
        <p>A committee of county, town and civic leaders proposed in 1996 that the property be devoted almost exclusively to housing for families in which at least one member is 55 or older. The state solicited bids, and early last year awarded the site to SBJ Associates of Garden City for $16.1 million.</p>
        <p>The town's zoning board held a hearing July 25 on the firm's application to rezone the property for 1,375 units, all but 75 of which would be restricted to senior housing. Another 100 would be sold at below-market prices, and another 100 would be rental units for low-income seniors. The other 1,100 units would be sold for $175,000 to $350,000.</p>
        <p>''More than 1,500 people showed up  and they were overwhelmingly in favor of the project,'' said John A. Harras, of Morton Weber &amp; Associates in Melville, the attorney for SBJ. Steve A. Israel, a Democratic town councilman, said the board was expected to act by the end of September on the request for a variance, from the current two-acre zoning.</p>
        <p>But two weeks ago, the Suffolk Legislature added another unknown to the equation: It offered the town $1.8 million for the developer if SBJ devoted 30 percent of the homes, or about 400 units, to low-cost housing for people of all ages.</p>
        <p>The money, which will go to the town in 15 months even if it does not make such a change, is Huntington's share of an $8 million fund derived from a settlement with the Long Island Power Authority involving the closing of the Shoreham nuclear plant.</p>
        <p>The legislature's presiding officer, Paul Tonna, a Republican of West Hills who sponsored the legislation, said the money was offered as ''a carrot -- no strings attached.''</p>
        <p>He pointed out that 7 out of 10 young people who grow up on the Island and leave for college do not come back. ''The No. 1 reason is that they can't afford to live here,'' Mr. Tonna said. ''Major employers, banks and industries are saying that this has got to stop. The L.I.D.C. site, the largest available tract of land available for housing on Long Island, cannot be a missed opportunity.''</p>
        <p>But a spokesman for Huntington Town, George Hoffman, said the lawmakers had imposed no such precise conditions on other towns.</p>
        <p>''All of our supervisors agree that this was a usurpation of home rule,'' he said. ''Only the Town of Huntington has been limited to using the money for infrastructure at the L.I.D.C. property, and only if the developer agrees to a 30 percent affordable component for all ages. This is politics at its worst.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hoffman's view of home rule is supported by officials in Smithtown, Southold and Riverhead.</p>
        <p>Mr. Harras, the SBJ attorney, said his client did not want to change the plan and did not want the $1.8 million. ''We say the Legislature should not micromanage our project,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The property is in a section of Huntington represented by Legislator Allan Binder, who said Mr. Tonna ''put the bill in without the usual courtesy of discussing it with me.''</p>
        <p>He suggested that Mr. Tonna was getting even with him because Mr. Binder opposed Mr. Tonna's selection as presiding supervisor. ''This seems to me purely political in nature,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Binder cited the county's recent purchase of 10.5 acres in Mr. Tonna's district in West Hills to preserve open space, which ''could just as easily have been for affordable housing, if that was his real motive.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Israel said Mr. Tonna had had an opportunity to insist the property be used for affordable housing when the state sold it. And he said Mr. Tonna and the co-sponsor of the latest bill, David Bishop, a Democrat from Lindenhurst, could have mentioned the housing needs when the site committee was in session.</p>
        <p>''Not at any time did they show up during that process and utter a word of concern about affordable housing at the L.I.D.C.,'' Mr. Israel said. ''And now, four weeks before the primary election, they suddenly found their conscience.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bishop and Mr. Israel are in a Democratic primary Sept. 12, along with a community activist, Ghena Grant, for the Second Congressional District seat of Rick Lazio, who is running for the Senate against Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tonna insisted that his bill was not driven by politics. He said it was introduced in February and that the L.I.D.C. stipulation was inserted in June at the behest of advocates for low-cost housing.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Bishop said that ''petty politics is being a 'nimby' and refusing to open the gates of that enormous property to middle- and working-class families.''</p>
        <p>Noting that 75 of the homes in the proposed complex have multiple bedrooms and are to be sold without any age restriction, Mr. Bishop said: ''The real purpose is to make that an enclave for millionaires. Everybody knows those homes will sell for $600,000.''</p>
        <p>Asked about Mr. Israel's charge that he had never before suggested that the property be used for affordable housing, Mr. Bishop replied: ''We didn't have the economy we have now. Long Island's economy and the developments of the last 10 years dictate that we create affordable homes for families in order to keep young people on the Island. And earlier this year we passed a bill setting aside for affordable housing all dwellings taken for back taxes. We also recently passed a $20 million bond to buy available land for affordable housing.''</p>
        <p>Huntington was singled out in the legislation, Mr. Bishop said, because ''it has a particularly bad record and is under court order to do better.''</p>
        <p>''They have not remedied their past wrongs,'' he continued. ''They are embarrassed, and this bill put a spotlight on the town's record.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Israel pointed out that the Huntington Town Board had ''voted for or authorized 353 units of affordable homes in the past four years, and I'll put that record against the number of affordable homes they have built any day of the week.''</p>
        <p>He added that just as it is important to keep young people on the Island, ''senior citizens deserve to stay on Long Island.''</p>
        <p>That sentiment was expressed repeatedly at the July 25 town hearing.</p>
        <p>Among those who spoke was Avi Saks of Dix Hills, who said he did not want to see seniors pitted against young people in the quest for housing. He said that affordable housing had been created elsewhere in the town and that this site should remain largely for seniors. And he quoted from Psalms the words, ''Don't forsake me in my old age.''</p>
        <p>Also expressing concern about the prospect of much more low-cost housing for families with children was Alissa Taff, president of the Half Hollow Hills School Board. She said that more than 1,000 new children had entered the 8,600-student district in the last three or four years and that construction of another 400 homes is currently planned.</p>
        <p>In a later interview, she said that to set aside 30 percent of the L.I.D.C. site for low-cost housing would mean another 400 families with children entering the district. That, she said, ''would push us over the edge.''</p>
        <p>It would mean, Ms. Taff continued, that the district would have to build a $42 million middle school for 800 children and a $20 million elementary school for 550 youngsters. But she questioned where the money would come from because voters twice rejected the library bond after approving $103 million in school bonds.</p>
        <p>''I can see the handwriting on the wall,'' said Ms. Taff. ''We can't ask taxpayers to pay for more.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Taff pointed out that while 491 youngsters graduated this year, the incoming kindergarten class has 705 students. To cope with the surge in enrollment, the district plans to build additions to each of its 11 school buildings and will ''likely reopen the Manasquan School, which is now used for the administration and special education programs,'' Ms. Taff said. ''We would then have to build a new administration building for them.''</p>
        <p>But Jim Morgo, president of the Long Island Housing Partnership, said studies had shown that 400 condo units of affordable housing would generate fewer students than the 75 non-age-restricted homes already planned.</p>
        <p>''A three-bedroom condo unit, according to all the empirical evidence, generates about one-third of a child,'' he said. ''But the 75 homes planned will have four or five bedrooms, and they will give you 150 to 170 kids.''</p>
        <p>Tim Ryan, a spokesman for the Suffolk County Executive, Robert J. Gaffney, said that although Mr. Gaffney supports low-cost housing, he would like to bring all parties together ''to try to accomplish this objective without interfering in local affairs.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 27, 2000, Sunday  An article last Sunday about plans to redevelop the former Long Island Developmental Center in Huntington misstated its function. It was a residence for the mentally retarded and developmentally disabled of all ages; the Sagamore Children's Center, adjacent to the Developmental Center and still in operation, is a children's psychiatric hospital.</p>
