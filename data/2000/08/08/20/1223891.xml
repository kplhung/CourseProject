        <p>Southern Illinois University Prof Edward Brunner letter agrees with Herbert Muschamp's August 13 column identifying Hart Crane's poem The Bridge with New York City and with his brief love affair with Emil Opffer (S)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Herbert Muschamp is quite right in identifying Hart Crane's epic poem ''The Bridge'' with New York City and with Emil Opffer [''Living Up to the Memories of a Poetic Old Skyline,'' Aug. 13]. Opffer was the love of Crane's life. Until their too-brief affair, Crane's plans for his ''American epic,'' first conceived in Cleveland, included a bridge, but it was any bridge, an abstract bridge. (One early poem called it ''The Bridge of Estador.'') After their affair in the spring of 1924, Crane centered his poem on the Brooklyn Bridge. Opffer's family lived at 110 Columbia Heights, where they rented rooms to boarders (Crane was one). Their love was played out within sight of the Brooklyn Bridge, which the two would have walked across to and from home -- a bridge that was itself a trysting site for love of all kinds. When Crane includes it in sections of ''The Bridge,'' it is coded as a souvenir of their love, notably in the last section's ecstatic descriptions.</p>

        <p>Herbert Muschamp is quite right in identifying Hart Crane's epic poem ''The Bridge'' with New York City and with Emil Opffer [''Living Up to the Memories of a Poetic Old Skyline,'' Aug. 13]. Opffer was the love of Crane's life. Until their too-brief affair, Crane's plans for his ''American epic,'' first conceived in Cleveland, included a bridge, but it was any bridge, an abstract bridge. (One early poem called it ''The Bridge of Estador.'') After their affair in the spring of 1924, Crane centered his poem on the Brooklyn Bridge.

When Crane includes it in sections of ''The Bridge,'' it is coded as a souvenir of their love, notably in the last section's ecstatic descriptions.</p>
        <p>''The Bridge'' is deeply personal, and, as Mr. Muschamp suggests, it is never better than when it describes New York City. Most of the poem was written on the Isle of Pines off the coast of Cuba, where Crane had retreated after quarreling with friends. There, his longing for the city produced a group of unexpected poems about New York that fit awkwardly into his original -- and deadly dull -- plan to write a chronological history of the machine in America. Among these new works were two that feature the other architecturally sensitive sites Mr. Muschamp mentions: Columbus Circle (''The Tunnel'') and South Street seaport (''Cutty Sark'').</p>
