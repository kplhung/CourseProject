        <p>Sister</p>
        <p>The Life of the Legendary</p>
        <p>American Interior Decorator</p>
        <p>Mrs. Henry Parish II.</p>
        <p>By Apple Parish Bartlett</p>
        <p>and Susan Bartlett Crater.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 358 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>St. Martin's Press. $35.</p>
        <p>In a perfect world, the world at large wouldn't need interior decorators. The citizenship would possess magical skills of style that could wrench mahogany from mud, silk from saccharine. But the world of interiors isn't perfect. Things fall apart. Consoles don't console. Chintz happens.</p>
        <p>In 1960, when Jacqueline Kennedy hired the decorator Sister Parish to help her ''do'' her new home, a newspaper headline proclaimed: ''Kennedys Pick Nun to Decorate White House.'' The confusion was inevitable, but the results were professionally divine: Sister Parish, a formidable, crusty lady of high social rank who was descended from Cotton Mather (think Puritan New England, although, yes, it's a great name for a fashion designer), found herself a star.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Parish, as she was addressed by almost everyone until her death in 1994, had assisted Mrs. Kennedy with various decorating projects since the late 1950's. Alas, a rift occurred toward the completion of Mrs. Parish's work at the White House. According to her granddaughter, Susan Bartlett Crater, ''it was primarily a problem over money and Jackie's belief that not everything had to be paid for. Sister wrote that it was because someone had told Jackie that she had kicked Caroline. I wouldn't have put it past her, but that was not the root of the falling-out. Later, Sister would shrug off the questions with one of her glib remarks, like 'Jackie got along much better with men than with women.' ''</p>
        <p>Just in time for the remaining days of carefree summer reading comes ''Sister,'' an oral biography of the decorator compiled by Crater and her mother, Apple Parish Bartlett. Here are selections from Mrs. Parish's own rather wonderful, often moving, reminiscences, intercut with observations from her family, employees, clients and friends. Annette de la Renta, the New York social leader, makes her first appearance in the book at about the age of 10, riding a horse up the staircase of her parents' country house. Also on hand are Brooke Astor, Diana Vreeland, Mario Buatta, Mark Hampton, Bunny Williams, Patsy Preston, Oatsie Charles, Slim Keith -- I know, I know, Oatsie, Patsy, Bunny, Apple, Slim . . . very pink and green, but these were the days when ''nice'' people set aside whole cocktail hours to concoct endearing nicknames.</p>
        <p>And then there's Yummy, Mrs. Parish's Pekingese pooch, who went everywhere. In one particularly dramatic episode, Yummy gets hold of the pants of Albert Hadley, Mrs. Parish's designing partner from 1962 onward, and won't let go. ''Yummy,'' Mrs. Parish writes, ''was the true lord of the firm of Parish-Hadley for 13 years. He attended every client meeting, visited every house and apartment and firm we decorated and, possibly because his fur matched the burnt-sugar upholstery of the company car, always made clear his privileged position, even after biting a client's fingers.''</p>
        <p>Yummy, however, was not in attendance when Mrs. Parish called at Estee Lauder's house in Manhattan, which she had visited many times when it was owned by a family friend. ''Oh, what I could do with this house,'' she whispered to her assistant, thinking no one could hear. Just then, Estee Lauder appeared at her elbow, touched her cheek and said, ''Oh, what I could do with that face.'' Mrs. Lauder did not become a client, although the next day she sent Mrs. Parish a kit of her cosmetic products.</p>
        <p>Continuity and ''character'' (the word Mrs. Parish preferred to ''class''), along with color and comfort, manifested in an English country-house style, were the foundations of Mrs. Parish's decorating. Her clients included established social people like Jane and Charles Engelhard, Babe and Bill Paley, Betsey and Jock Whitney, and Ann and Gordon Getty. Mrs. Parish also waxed enthusiastic about new friends. Sometimes she gave cocktail parties to mix her Old Guard pals with the new people she met in New York. Dressed in his sophisticated uniform of choice, a black turtleneck and black pants, the fashion designer Halston came to one of Mrs. Parish's parties. ''How do you decide to dress like that?'' she asked. ''Sister,'' Halston responded, ''I always imagine how Babe would dress if she were a man.''</p>
        <p>When she was young, Dorothy May Kinnicutt, nicknamed Sister by her older brother, wore ermine coats and brown leggings and regularly went along with her paternal grandfather, Dr. Francis Kinnicutt -- Edith Wharton's doctor and close friend -- to the Presbyterian Hospital in New York ''to encourage the patients.'' Mrs. Parish's father, Gustav Hermann Kinnicutt, was a Harvard man and financier who appreciated good furniture. Her mother, May Appleton Tuckerman, had ''instinctive good taste'' and an ''innate sense of a well-ordered, properly regulated life.''</p>
        <p>After coming out -- think debutante -- in 1927 and then spending a season at the family's apartment on the Quai d'Orsay in Paris, Sister met Harry Parish at a dinner given by her parents at Mayfields, their house (with gardens designed by Ellen Shipman) in Far Hills, N.J. On Valentine's Day, 1930, at St. George's Church in Gramercy Park, Sister and Harry Parish were married by Dr. Drury, the celebrated headmaster of St. Paul's School.</p>
        <p>The Parishes had two daughters and one son. After a spell in Manhattan, the family moved to a house in Far Hills. Inspired by Mayfields and her parents' beloved place in Dark Harbor, Me., Mrs. Parish decorated her first country house. It was a smash. Soon she was helping her neighbors with their places. One neighbor, Senator Joseph S. Frelinghuysen, asked her if she would help decorate a new restaurant in nearby Somerville. ''The place was called Howard Johnson's,'' Mrs. Parish remembered. ''I did what I could. I dressed the waitresses in aqua, did the walls in aqua, made the place mats in aqua. I guess I must have thought it was quite chic, but I haven't done a thing in aqua since.''</p>
        <p>In 1933, during the Depression, when her husband's salary at Loeb, Rhodes was cut, Mrs. Parish decided to go into the decorating business officially. ''She was a young woman who had, in her own words, 'never opened a window or poured a glass of water myself,' and she decided to take her fate into her own hands,'' Susan Crater writes. ''She had been accustomed to living a certain way, and she was going to do everything in her power to maintain it for herself and her children.''</p>
        <p>The downside of the oral-history method of using quotations to construct a biography involves wading through occasional patches of flat water, in this case testimonies from assorted Parish-Hadley clients. The method also allows little room for extended analysis, leaving the reader to decide why he or she should care about Mrs. Parish. One good reason is that ''Sister'' is the anatomy of a lady, one of the last of a breed. Fortunately, the flat passages pass by quickly, and the tide rises again and again, buoyed by Mrs. Parish's voice and those of her friends, colleagues, family and protegees. Mrs. Parish lived to make jokes, as she did when she happened upon Claus von Blow in the lobby of 960 Fifth Avenue the summer he was indicted. ''Have you had a nice summer?'' she asked.</p>
        <p>She loved to swim in the ocean off her summer home in Maine. First-time houseguests knew they had to swim with her or sink forever in her estimation. On one such occasion, she drove to a favorite bathing spot, handed David Kleinberg (now a successful decorator in New York) a pair of old trunks and told him to go change in the bushes. ''I knew that I had to go in the water, which in Maine practically has ice cubes floating in it . . . or the weekend was over,'' Kleinberg recalls. He dived in, swam for a bit, and thought he was dying. When he got out of the water, Mrs. Parish handed him one of her old terry-cloth Porthault robes. Back in the car, all she said was, ''Those bushes are much skimpier than I thought.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Parish's days of robust frivolity and hard work were accompanied by frequent nights of insomnia, self-doubt and loneliness. ''I have ached all my life, thinking I have done wrong or could have done better,'' she confides. She treated her malaise by believing in the recuperative power of her own homes, particularly the Parish place in Maine -- the second leading character in the book -- and with her love of family. Her devotion to home and family elevates her story from society and celebrity gossip -- of which there is plenty, like the account of the time the boxer Mike Tyson visited the Engelhards in Far Hills -- to something more universal and noble: when, for instance, her son, Harry, dies suddenly at 50 or when she remembers her husband's last summer in Maine before he died in 1977. As he grew increasingly ill, Mrs. Parish would take him a watering can filled with sea water and sprinkle his forehead and hands. He would smile and say, ''This will make me well.'' He might also add, ''And do you remember -- you brought that watering can back with you from France?''</p>
        <p>''As a child,'' Mrs. Parish writes, ''I discovered the happy feelings that familiar things can bring -- an old apple tree, a favorite garden, the smell of a fresh-clipped hedge, simply knowing that when you round the corner, nothing will be changed, nothing will be gone. I try to instill that lucky part of my life in each house that I do. Some think a decorator should change a house. I try to give permanence to a house, to bring out the experiences, the memories, the feelings that make it a home.''</p>
