        <p>THE broad stock market indexes have pretty much fizzled this year. So why are many investors smiling?</p>
        <p>Because, at long last, a greater number of stocks are rising today, rewarding more of their owners. The battle between the haves -- stocks that are gaining -- and the have-nots is finally beginning to even out.</p>
        <p>Therefore, despite the paltry performance of the indexes, the stock market is a much more promising place to invest now than it has been in some time.</p>
        <p>''Since March, the stock market has become more egalitarian, with an increasing number of stocks rising rather than falling,'' said A. Marshall Acuff Jr., a market strategist at Salomon Smith Barney. ''We're seeing a rational rebalancing of the excesses in the market.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Acuff is referring to the phenomenon of the last two years in which strong performances in the broad indexes were fueled by a small group of stocks, mostly big-name technology companies. Last year, for example, only 31 stocks accounted for the entire 21 percent gain in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500. In 1995, by contrast, 341 stocks were responsible for the index's 37.6 percent climb.</p>
        <p>As the indexes ascended in recent years, they masked a fairly sick stock market over all. Now this has begun to reverse. Even though the indexes look weak, the internals of the market are strengthening. In Wall Street parlance, the market's breadth has improved significantly.</p>
        <p>''We're still going to have some high-priced stocks,'' Mr. Acuff said. ''But there is improving momentum in the value sector.''</p>
        <p>This turnabout owes something to investors' optimism that the Federal Reserve will not be raising interest rates again anytime soon. But Mr. Acuff said there were other powerful catalysts for the democratization of the market.</p>
        <p>Consolidation is one driver. Public companies continue to make acquisitions, hoping to capture the value hidden in underappreciated shares. And big private equity buyers are also increasingly active. Last Friday, for example, Carl C. Icahn, the financier, announced his intent to buy more than $15 million in shares of General Motors, a company whose stock has fallen 27 percent from its April high. G.M. rose 5.4 percent on the news but its shares still trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of less than 8 while the Standard &amp; Poor's index has a P/E of almost 30. Mr. Icahn clearly sees G.M. as undervalued.</p>
        <p>Another reason that investors seem to be broadening their stock search is that a number of richly valued companies have recently announced shortfalls in anticipated earnings growth. To avoid being flattened by the inevitable stampede out of a stock whose executives have to release such news, investors are likely shopping among companies with already diminished growth expectations. Pleasant surprises are always easier to take than the unpleasant kind.</p>
        <p>The broadening of the market's rise is most evident in New York Stock Exchange shares. Unfortunately, breadth in the Nasdaq composite has not yet improved. This may be because the N.Y.S.E. includes more rate-sensitive stocks, like real estate investment trusts and preferred shares, which have responded favorably to the view that the Fed is finished. And the small stocks on the Nasdaq may remain in the doldrums because they are too liquid for big investors to buy without jolting share prices.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the rising tide that is now lifting more stocks looks to Mr. Acuff as if it has staying power, unlike the shift to value stocks in 1998 that was all too fleeting. He points out that many of the top-performing market sectors so far this year consist of formerly depressed industries. ''That improvement offers hope,'' he said, ''that maybe other areas will catch on as well.''</p>
