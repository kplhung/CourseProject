        <p>Raccoons used to have it easier in Bensonhurst.</p>
        <p>On the 1950's television show ''The Honeymooners,'' the Bensonhurst bus driver Ralph Kramden frequented a lodge, the International Order of Friendly Raccoons, to find good humor and camaraderie among brother raccoons.</p>
        <p>Today, experiencing a rash of sightings, residents say the city is not doing enough to rid the area of what they fear is a potentially dangerous raccoon infestation. ''The city has taken the position that they have the right to be there,'' said William Guarinello, chairman of Community Board 11, who said he had a family of raccoons in his backyard. ''They say we as homeowners can trap them and bring them in. But if I pick up one of those traps I could get bitten.''</p>
        <p>Residents said they feared disease and property damage from the animals, which have been spotted in sewers, chimneys, trees and gardens and on roofs. Sandra Mullin, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of Health, said that the main concern was whether the animals carried rabies but that there was no report of any attacks on people.</p>
        <p>''In general, raccoons try to avoid contact with people,'' she said, ''and certainly people should avoid contact with them.'' She added that the city did not pick up animals that did not pose a health risk. ''We do see other wildlife in New York City -- squirrels, occasional skunks,'' she said. ''Unless the animals are projecting any signs of illness, they are not transported away from the city as a matter of course.'' But she said that because of the concern, the department was looking into remedies.</p>
        <p>Virginia Ruggiero, 77, who has lived on Bay 34th Street for 45 years, said, ''I'm afraid for our neighborhood children,'' adding: ''They don't know the difference; they might think they're cats.''</p>
        <p>No one, including Ms. Mullin of the Health Department, could explain  the recent wave of raccoons, but Mary Ann Basile, who lives on Bay 47th Street, suggested it might trace to the demolition of houses this summer to make way for a Home Depot. ''Maybe they got displaced,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Asked about Bensonhurst's earlier, more positive associations with raccoons, Ms. Basile, 52, who has lived there all her life, laughed and said she remembered Kramden and his raccoon hat. ''Just like I told the priest down at the church,'' she said. ''I'm going to make him a raccoon coat if I caught one. He said, 'I really don't want one.' ''</p>
