        <p>THIS cozy country restaurant is certainly a destination for all seasons, but summer and fall find it in its prime. Set under mature trees and among the great swaths of manicured turf of Dutchess County, Allyn's offers delightful outdoor dining when the weather permits. At tables scattered on the lawn, guests can enjoy the lovely garden and the panorama of horse country -- neatly fenced paddocks on rolling green hills.</p>

        <p>THIS cozy country restaurant is certainly a destination for all seasons, but summer and fall find it in its prime. Set under mature trees and among the great swaths of manicured turf of Dutchess County, Allyn's offers delightful outdoor dining when the weather permits. At tables scattered on the lawn, guests can enjoy the lovely garden and the panorama of horse country -- neatly fenced paddocks on rolling green hills.</p>
        <p>Generous casements seemed to bring in the outdoors, and from our table in the dining room we watched a hummingbird sampling the sweets of purple bells of hosta and crimson trumpet flowers.</p>
        <p>Ten years had passed since our last visits to Allyn's, and we looked forward to our return. A few disappointments were in store. The gracious large dining room with its singular illuminated equine fixture was closed. The elegant terrace lounge we remembered so well, with its soft leather sofas and polished tables, was now an unprepossessing dining room, with tables set for some future party. Rough painted boards, paper-topped tables, a mural of the seasons and a fireplace marked the dining room for everyday use. The lovely countryside, however, and this kitchen's use of local products were reason enough to find this restaurant.</p>
        <p>Hudson Valley apple cider with dark rum was a delicious drink worth looking for. Excellent soft butter and good breads, both produced nearby, came to every table. McEnroe organic beets, also supplied by a local farm, mingled with goat cheese, apples, bits of smoked bacon and toasted walnuts for an especially  delectable starter. As outstanding was a plate of moist silky prosciutto, sweet, perfectly ripe figs and slices of fragrant homemade bread. Deeply flavored broth laved a mix of ricotta gnocchi and slivers of sweet red pepper, mushrooms and asparagus -- all served in a stylish white bowl. Tender, shredded nappa cabbage and wild mushrooms outshone the starring wafers of smoked pork.</p>
        <p>Entrees arrived in ample portions. Supplied by Stone Church farms, two quails came stuffed with sweet sausage and brioche, tasty mashed potatoes capturing all the lovely gamey gravy. Riblets from an herbed rack of lamb were nicely pink as ordered; a bulb of deliciously oozy roasted garlic and red potatoes finished the dish. Sweet pea pods lent crunch to  succulent swordfish with rice pilaf.</p>
        <p>These days lean meats are desirable. But cooking lean, dense-fleshed pork loin demands careful timing. Tournedos of pork were overdone, juiceless and chewy, but the barley pilaf accompaniment was first rate. Unfortunately, vinegar flooded a dish of fine sea scallops over fettuccine, and, absorbing the astringency, the pasta was inedible.</p>
        <p>Desserts brought mixed success. On the plus side, Key lime custard pie on graham cracker crust proved authentically tangy; and filled with good ice cream, four profiteroles were sublime. But share this dish: two would have been plenty. Otherwise, there was little relief from the one-note chocolate intensity of Sin cake and Fire and Ice (warmed cake with ice cream). Blueberry tart was a disgrace of desiccated blueberries.</p>
        <p>A three-course dinner averages $33 without drinks, tax and tip. Allyn's is approachable from Route 22 or the Taconic State Parkway.</p>
        <p>Allyn's  Route 44, Millbrook  (845) 677-5888</p>
