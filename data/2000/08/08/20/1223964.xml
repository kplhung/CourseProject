      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The Posies are regarded as leaders of the ever-resuscitating power-pop revival. They combine the influences of the Who, the Raspberries, the Beatles and Big Star, while adding deft harmonies, which many compare with the Hollies. (They have even recorded the Hollies' ''King Midas in Reverse.'')</p>
        <p>Their hook-heavy, sometimes psychedelic guitars boom, goading eccentric, tart songs about quite ordinary matters. Always critics' darlings and cult favorites, they are now eight recordings into a 14-year career. They are now supporting both a greatest-hits album and the newly released swan song (they're breaking up) ''Alive Before the Iceberg,'' a hazy melancholic recording.</p>

        <p>Opening for them is Shannon Wright, whose stark, acoustic-based songs and whispery Suzanne Vega-like vocals often mix some antsy and avant-garde jazz and folk and even a little punk. They will be performing at Maxwell's, 1093 Washington Street, Hoboken, on Aug. 21 at 8:30 p.m. (201) 798-4064.</p>
