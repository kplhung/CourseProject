They include a dog show, a skillet toss and a chainsaw contest on Thursday, a horse show on Friday and a circus that runs from Friday through next Sunday. Harness racing, a mule and donkey show, a bench-press contest and Farm Boys Saturday Night are scheduled on Saturday, and next Sunday the events include a draught-horse show, cattle parade and arm-wrestling contest.</p>
        <p>Throughout the four days, visitors can browse the petting zoo, a beekeeping exhibit, professional and amateur landscaping competitions, fine art, Christmas tree and wreath shows, working steer and other livestock demonstrations, and stage entertainment. They can chow down on barbecue, take a few midway rides, have a go at bingo, and park the children for awhile at special entertainment and activity programs.</p>
        <p>Admission is $5, under 12 free, and $2 for people 65 and older on Friday. Parking costs $2. A booklet containing information about Connecticut fairs is available from the Association of Connecticut Fairs Inc., Post Office Box 563, Somers 06071. Enclose $1 and a stamped, self-addressed envelope.</p>
        <p>Art in the Park</p>
        <p>The 25-year-old Ridgefield Guild of Artists will hold its 20th annual Art in the Park show today from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. in Ballard Park. More than 90 artists and craftspeople participate in the event, traveling to Ridgefield from points all along the Eastern Seaboard.</p>
        <p>This is a serious exhibition and sale. No food vendors, Dixieland bands or face-painters allowed, although a resident hot dog man pulls up his cart alongside the park on Main Street.</p>
        <p>Apart from the collections of abstract and representational painting, photography and ceramics, some of the more unusual items to be displayed include handmade soaps, dried florals with telephone and typewriter bases, carved ducks, loons and other shorebirds, and Italian glass mosaics.</p>
        <p>The show will take place rain or shine.</p>
        <p>Cabaret Symposium</p>
        <p>Under way at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford is the  12th annual Cabaret Symposium, made up of workshops with master teachers and evening performances in the Dina Merrill Theater through Saturday.</p>
        <p>The Faculty Follies is on the bill tonight at 7 o'clock, featuring 13 master teachers including Tex Arnold, George Hall, Margaret Whiting, Julie Wilson and Jack Rangler. Tickets are $20.</p>
        <p>''George Hall Explores Music Hall'' will be presented on Tuesday at 5 p.m. with a ticket price of $10. ''The Song's the Thing'' on Tuesday at 7 p.m., features Julie Gold, songwriter, and Carol Hall, Rick Jensen, Lina Koutrakos and Shelly Markham, faculty members.</p>
        <p>Baby Jane Dexter will give a 7 p.m. performance on Friday titled ''Celebrating Betsy White,'' subtitled ''Survival of the Fittest.'' Admission will be $25. The closing show on Saturday at 7 p.m. will include all 36 teachers in ''Cabaret Fellows Grand Finale,'' a series of works-in-progress created during the nine-day symposium. Ticket are $20.</p>
        <p>For reservations or more information, call (860) 443-1238. The center is at 306 Great Neck Road.</p>
        <p>Mixed-Media Collages</p>
        <p>When Debi Pendell begins work on one of her mixed-media collages she has no preconception of what will materialize. ''I use things that simply show up in my life,'' she said, ''wrapping paper, letters, pictures, fabric, rusty washers, crushed bottle caps, used dryer sheets. The work is about seeing and feeling the importance of the ordinary. What we pass by every day without even noticing.''</p>
        <p>An exibition of her collages may be seen at Ulla Surland's Gallery Eleven, at 11 Unquowa Road, in Fairfield through Sept. 12.</p>
        <p>The glue that binds Ms. Pendell's diverse found and made objects together is acrylic paint, worked quickly in a wet-on-wet manner. Some of the finished pieces are complex and crowded, others are simple and quiet. Ms. Pendell's work is represented in the collections of several corporations and individuals in the United States and Canada.</p>
        <p>Viewing hours are on Tuesday through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Call (203) 259-1572 for more information.</p>
        <p>Children's Program</p>
        <p>The schooner Amistad, berthed for a week in Bridgeport on its odyssey through Connecticut's waterfront towns, is the inspiration for a children's program on Friday at noon, when stories from Africa will be told by Eshu Bumpus, of Young Audiences of Connecticut. From 6:30 to 9 p.m., a benefit reception will feature African music and dance by Sankofa Kuumba, music by the Steve Clark Trio and gospel music by Marcia Fountain, vocalist.</p>
        <p>Both programs will take place at the Discovery Museum, 4450 Park Avenue. Proceeds from admissions will help support education programs in which the museum brings urban and suburban students together for art and science projects. Call (203) 372-3521 for more information and admission prices.</p>
        <p>Free Your Art</p>
        <p>Saturday is Free Your Art Day at Bushnell Park in Hartford from noon to 8 p.m.</p>
        <p>Presented by a group of young men and women who operate a traveling performance art company called Metaphoric Soul, the event will feature performance artists from Hartford, New Haven, New York, Springfield, Mass., and elsewhere. A theme of violence prevention will run through the offerings.</p>
        <p>During open mike sessions, people in the audience will have an opportunity to perform.</p>
        <p>Visual artists will display their work, there will be storytellers, mask-making, and vendors selling food, musical instruments and jewelry.</p>
        <p>Metaphoric Soul was formed in Hartford a year ago with a Poetry in the Park session that continues on Thursdays from 6 to 8 p.m. The group has performed at poetry slams, Real Art Ways workshops, correctional facilities, theater, public schools and cafes.</p>
        <p>Admission is free. Call (860) 363-3730 for more information.</p>
        <p>Woodworking Tips</p>
        <p>Dovetailing and butt, mortise and tenon joints are the essentials of basic woodworking to be taught from Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., at the Woodworkers Club, 215 Westport Avenue (Route 1) in Norwalk.</p>
        <p>Ian Kirby, a master woodworker, will conduct the sessions, suitable for beginners and for experienced woodworkers who want to polish their skills.</p>
        <p>Tools and how to use them, analyses of projects and working methods, lectures and hands-on sessions will give students the ability to build objects on their own for fun or profit.</p>
        <p>The course fee is $500. Call (203) 847-9663 to register or obtain more information.</p>
        <p>Art Exhibition</p>
        <p>The painter Hennie Stargardter and the metal scupltor Hans Stargardter are exhibiting their work in the lobby of the UConn Health Center, 263 Farmington Avenue, in Farmington through Sept. 13.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Stargardter has taught art in the Hartford public schools for more than 20 years and is a member of the Connecticut Academy of Fine Arts and several Connecticut art organizations.</p>
        <p>Her monotypes and her work with acrylics and oil sticks have been exhibited throughout the state.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stargardter might be called a late starter in the art world. After retiring as an engineer, he picked up on his youthful interest in ornamental ironwork and studied with two metal masters, Frances Felton and Heikki Seppa, then began a 20-year career of creating metal sculptures that have been exhibited widely in shows and galleries.</p>
        <p>The exhibition may be seen daily from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m.</p>
