        <p>The length of one's blade can be a measure of one's authority in the kitchen. Some virtuosos become human slice, dice and mince machines. Others, and I was one, take pity on a tomato bleeding under a light, short and dull blade and reach for ever heavier, longer, sharper knives. Either way, one learns the delicate balance between violence and nurture by mastering the use of something capable of both.</p>
        <p>A big knife seals the food it cuts, leaving the juice intact rather than on the cutting board. A good knife in a bold hand conserves human energy, as well as the flavor and texture of any ingredient bowed by its blade. A chef's knife, also called a French knife -- an elongated, triangular blade heavier at the spine and tapering to a mean, thin edge -- is still favored by professionals. But a recent poll found that amateurs are still shy of thick blades that typically run about 10 inches long.</p>

        <p>The length of one's blade can be a measure of one's authority in the kitchen. Some virtuosos become human slice, dice and mince machines. Others, and I was one, take pity on a tomato bleeding under a light, short and dull blade and reach for ever heavier, longer, sharper knives. Either way, one learns the delicate balance between violence and nurture by mastering the use of something capable of both.</p>
        <p>A big knife seals the food it cuts, leaving the juice intact rather than on the cutting board. A good knife in a bold hand conserves human energy, as well as the flavor and texture of any ingredient bowed by its blade. A chef's knife, also called a French knife -- an elongated, triangular blade heavier at the spine and tapering to a mean, thin edge -- is still favored by professionals. But a recent poll found that amateurs are still shy of thick blades that typically run about 10 inches long.</p>
        <p>The ambivalence can be eased by experience. For instance, by thoroughly dicing a panoply of summer vegetables to create a green gazpacho, you can start to feel more at ease with a big knife. And the results -- bits of vegetables that burst in the mouth, as opposed to the mush yielded by a dull blade or a blender, will reward the effort. The same can be said for the minuscule dice of a caponata, or chopped summer salad. Combining soft plums with pink grapefruit, on the other hand, is a study in the delicacy of a sharp knife.</p>
        <p>Unlike cleavers, whose form has remained static since the Iron Age and which remain capable of bursting joints of meat and of finer work, chef's knives have evolved along with cuisine. The form of the knife, in other words, has followed its function and lends itself to minute, precise tasks. The best versions are forged -- cast, blade to tang, in a mold and tamped to create the slope from the spine to the razor-thin cutting edge -- from high carbon stainless steel, an alloy that holds an edge without rusting.</p>
        <p>A dull blade is a dangerous hindrance that makes each job messier and more difficult than the last. You can realign the edge of the blade before each use with a few swift rotating swipes on a sharpening steel at a 20-degree angle. Every so often, use a sharpening stone to cut a new surface on your blade, substituting coarser stones with finer ones until the blade can split the proverbial hair.</p>
        <p>Oversharpening a blade can be just as sinful, grinding away good steel and ending a knife's usefulness long before its time. Electric grinders do the fastest damage, though it's easy enough to ruin a blade on any sharpening tool if you saw away on it long enough. Usually a few good swipes is all it takes.</p>
        <p>Nowadays, high-quality plastic and composite handles have largely replaced wood. The key is choosing a grip that feels comfortable and steady. Shake hands with many knives before buying. A good chef's knife is an extension of the human hand, propelled by human force.</p>
        <p>A flick of the sharp tip cuts, a repeated guillotine action slices, a consistent rock-rock-rocking that should, like a good tennis stroke, emanate from the knees, legs, hips and shoulder rather than from the forearm, dices, minces or chops. A swat from the flat side crushes garlic or spices. But the beauty of a chef's knife is the gentle slope of the blade, built to promote the steady cutting action that, when mastered, becomes a meditative rhythm.</p>
        <p>Sometimes I chop things just to relax. Later, surveying bowls of finely chopped vegetables and meat, I decide what to do with them all. In the end, cooking is the only thing that separates a weapon from a tool.</p>
        <p>Intricate Green Gazpacho  1 bunch cilantro  1 bunch parsley, plus more for garnish  6 sprigs basil</p>
        <p>1/4 jalapeno, coarsely chopped  1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil  Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper to taste  1 scallion, trimmed and thinly sliced  3 tomatillos, cut into tiny dice</p>
        <p>1/2 semi-ripe avocado, peeled and cut into tiny dice</p>
        <p>1/2 Granny Smith apple, cut into tiny dice  1 teaspoon lemon juice  1 medium cucumber, peeled and seeded, cut into julienne strips.</p>
        <p>1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add cilantro, parsley and basil and cook until bright green, about 45 seconds. Remove the herbs and place into a bowl of ice water until cold. Drain.</p>
        <p>2. In a blender, combine the herb mixture, jalapeno and 2 cups ice water and puree until smooth. With the motor running, add the oil. Using a sieve over a medium bowl, strain the herb puree and season with salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>3. In a large bowl, toss together the scallion, tomatillos, avocado, apple and lemon juice and season with salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>4. In a small bowl, season the cucumber with salt and pepper. Using your hands, squeeze out the excess liquid from the cucumber. Place  1/4 of the cucumber in the center of each of four soup bowls and surround the cucumber with the tomatillo mixture. Pour  1/4 of the herb puree into each bowl. Garnish each bowl with chopped parsley and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Plum-and-Grapefruit Salsa</p>
        <p>2 grapefruits  8 plums, halved, pitted and thinly sliced  1 jalapeno, finely chopped  1 tablespoon finely chopped ginger  3 tablespoons coarsely chopped cilantro  1 tablespoon coarsely chopped mint  Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper to taste.</p>
        <p>1. Using a knife, remove the peel and pith from the grapefruit and discard. Cut the sections out from between the membranes and cut each section in half lengthwise.</p>
        <p>2. Transfer to a medium bowl and add the plums, jalapeno, ginger, cilantro and mint. Toss and season with salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>3. Let sit at room temperature for at least half an hour and up to 1 hour. Serve with grilled chicken, seafood or tortilla chips. (Can be covered and refrigerated for one day.)</p>
        <p>Yield: 2 cups.</p>
        <p>Tiny-Dice Caponata on Parmesan Croutons  7 tablespoons olive oil  1 Japanese eggplant, cut into tiny dice  Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</p>
        <p>1/2 red bell pepper, cored, seeded and cut into tiny dice</p>
        <p>1/2 yellow bell pepper, cored, seeded and cut into tiny dice  1 small Spanish onion, peeled and finely chopped  2 cloves garlic, peeled and finely chopped  3 tablespoons raisins, soaked in hot water for 10 minutes, drained and coarsely chopped  3 tablespoons coarsely chopped Spanish capers  12 thin slices Italian bread, like ciabata or Pugliese  1 tablespoon good-quality  Parmesan cheese  6 thinly sliced basil leaves for garnish.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. In a large skillet, over high heat, heat 3 tablespoons oil. Add the eggplant and cook, stirring, until well browned and soft, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to medium bowl. Wipe out the skillet, return to the heat and heat 1 tablespoon oil. Add the bell peppers and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and transfer to the bowl. Wipe out the skillet, return to the heat and add 1 tablespoon oil. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until browned and soft, about 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper and transfer to the bowl. Wipe out the skillet, return to the heat and add 1 tablespoon oil. Add the garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 45 seconds. Transfer to the bowl. Stir in the raisins and capers. Set the mixture aside.</p>
        <p>2. In a large bowl, toss the bread slices with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and season with salt. Arrange the slices on a baking sheet, sprinkle with the cheese and bake until golden brown, about 3 minutes.</p>
        <p>3. Place a dollop of the eggplant mixture on each crouton, garnish with basil and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 appetizer servings.</p>
        <p>Chopped Summer Salad With Beets and Goat Cheese  3 beets (about  3/4pound), trimmed  2 tablespoons granulated sugar  2 tablespoons tarragon vinegar  Kosher salt to taste  2 teaspoons Dijon mustard  2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil  Freshly ground pepper to taste  8 radishes, trimmed and thinly sliced  12 pear or cherry tomatoes, quartered</p>
        <p>1/4 small red onion, peeled and thinly sliced  1 scallion, trimmed and thinly sliced  8 romaine lettuce leaves, ribs removed, stacked and thinly sliced  17-ounce log goat cheese, cut into 12 slices.</p>
        <p>1. In a large saucepan, combine the beets, sugar and 1 tablespoon vinegar and cover with salted water by 1 inch. Bring to a boil, lower the heat and simmer, covered, until very tender, about 45 minutes. Drain and place in a bowl in the refrigerator to cool. When cool, rub the skins off with your hands. Discard the skins. Slice the beets into 16 thin slices.</p>
        <p>2. In a small bowl, make a vinaigrette by whisking together the mustard and remaining 1 tablespoon vinegar. While whisking vigorously, slowly drizzle in the oil until incorporated. Season with salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>3. In a large bowl, toss together the radishes, tomatoes, onion, scallion and lettuce with the vinaigrette mixture and season with salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>4. Arrange 4 beet slices in the center of a plate and season with salt and pepper. Place 3 slices of goat cheese in the form of a triangle on top of the beets and top with  1/4of the salad mixture. Repeat with the remaining ingredients and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
