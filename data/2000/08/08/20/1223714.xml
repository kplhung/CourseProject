        <p>''This is a terrific country,'' Bill Bryson says to a park ranger in a moment of frank bliss midway through his new book about Australia. (The title is an ironic spin on a line in a patriotic jingle, ''I love a sunburnt country.'') Such moments of pure compatibility bubble up throughout his travels, which take him by rail from Sydney across to Perth, then to Canberra, Adelaide and Melbourne in the south and Cairns and Darwin in the north. From there he drives cross-country to Uluru (the former Ayers Rock) in the country's desert center. Having imagined Australia from afar as ''a sort of 'Baywatch' with cricket'' -- which already had its charms -- he fell for the real place on his first visit in 1992: ''I liked it, straight off, without quibble or doubt, in a way I had never expected to. Something about it just agreed with me.'' As a result, the book exudes Bryson's sheer pleasure in the untapped narrative possibilities of this vast island continent.</p>
        <p>In return, Australia serves Bryson brilliantly. It is, for a start, a statistician's paradise, and one of Bryson's talents is his way with numbers. Australia is, he reminds us, above all empty: its population of 18 million is less than the annual population growth in China. And while the average world population density is 117 people per square mile, that of the United States 76 and that of Macao a claustrophobic's nightmare of 69,000, Australia's is only 6 -- and even that is skewed because 86 percent of the population bunch together along the coast.</p>
        <p>For each man or woman in Australia there are two sheep and over 16 rabbits, the latter introduced in 1859 by one enterprising man who brought 24 wild rabbits from England in an effort to ginger up the landscape and remind him of home. This is only one of the madcap introductions of species that have been effected, like the activities of some demented dating agency, to bring in everything from rampant blackberries to giraffes and camels -- all of which stand as symbols for the way Australia has been plagued throughout its 200-odd-year settlement by weird projections of what kind of a country it actually was and what it should be. And natural things aren't all that run wild, once introduced here. Consider, for example, the ''pokies,'' the hugely popular slot machines. With less than 1 percent of the world's population, Australia has more than 20 percent of its slot machines. That's some statistic.</p>
        <p>What appeals most to Bryson, though, is the way that Australia is a genuine, admirable model of normalcy -- the Norway of the Southern Hemisphere'' -- played out against a fantasmagorically surreal backdrop that most Australians blithely ignore or play down. The ritual incantation ''no worries'' has particular charm when set against a background of man-eating crocodiles, ferocious sea rips that ''pass you round like an unwanted parcel'' and creatures that ''seemed to have evolved as if they had misread the manual'' -- all of them nicely suited to Bryson's mock-heroic travel writing.</p>
        <p>Australia is also home to the oldest continuous culture in the world, one that was probably the first to depict itself, to fish and to make boats and yet whose literally aboriginal significance no one much notices, least of all the Australians themselves. It is a country so vast that a Japanese doomsday sect could mount a dry-run nuclear explosion in the wilderness and nobody twigged until years later. (I have an Australian postcard that vividly shows the sheer size of the place, superimposing a map of Australia over Europe. It stretches from Ireland right over to Moscow, the Black Sea and Turkey.) Australia is a country where a prime minister, Harold Holt, could simply disappear into the ocean, in what Bryson calls the ''Swim That Needs No Towel,'' and hardly be missed.</p>
        <p>It was on his quest to find the beach Holt disappeared from that Bryson met that park ranger on a magnificent headland and exclaimed his praise. But it wasn't the splendor of the view that prompted this bliss, it was the utter compatibility of his sense of humor with Australia's. The ranger told Bryson that a memorial had been built in Melbourne to honor the departed prime minister: '' 'Know what it was? . . . He grinned very slightly. 'A municipal swimming pool.' 'Seriously?' His grin broadened, but the nod was sincere. 'This is a terrific country,' I said.'' The thing that Bryson most loves about Australia -- its ''effortlessly dry, direct way of viewing the world'' -- is, in fact, his own. They're a perfect fit.</p>
        <p>Yet underlying the appealing side of the ''no worries'' Australia is something much darker, which Bryson also anatomizes. He characteristically warms to the fact that ''outside the cities it is still 1958'' -- which means there are ''gas stations with old-fashioned pumps and no canopies over the forecourt, so that you pumped your gas in full sun, as I am sure God intended it.'' However, keeping the 1950's also means keeping its underside, repression. This has been the bane of Australia since 1787, when Capt. Arthur Phillip loaded up his cargo of petty British convicts and dumped them on the other side of the world. ''Never before had so many people been moved such a great distance at such expense -- and all to be incarcerated,'' says Bryson, moved to Churchillian cadence.</p>
        <p>Convict ancestry was until recently a source of unmentionable shame -- called ''the Stain.'' Another aspect of Australia's repression was that the very existence of the Aborigines was blocked off: until 1967 they weren't even counted in the census, and, notoriously, their culture and spirit came close to obliteration. Also on the minus side is the fact that a surprisingly large chunk of English-language literature was banned right up to the 1960's -- and the list of banned books was itself banned, so you couldn't even find out what you weren't allowed to read. Clearly, Australia has had some serious amnesia zones to explore, and this it has been doing over the past generation. In these circumstances, books like Bryson's and that of another ''foreigner,'' the eminent and versatile British travel writer Geoffrey Moorhouse, aren't just tie-ins to the 2000 Olympic Games. They are part of the uncovering of Australia's hidden past.</p>
        <p>In ''Sydney: The Story of a City,'' Moorhouse's long opening description of an imaginary mariner -- our sea captain'' -- approaching the fabled harbor does have unfortunate colonial echoes, and a rather distancing effect. However, the body of the book is a virtuoso exposition of the gritty layers of social history that have formed Sydney -- the first place where Europeans settled and so, to some extent, a paradigm for the rest of the country.</p>
        <p>With a wealth of narrative detail, Moorhouse shows how Sydney has always been, above all, a workingman's town, as cities like London and New York no longer are: ''This truth includes all the bloody-minded camaraderie, all the bitterly unforgiven memories, all the crude defensiveness, all the fundamental decency and all the occasional cruelty that goes with the working man's territory. Here is a place where such people fight for what they've got and never, never back down, even though they risk being broken and cast aside. No one can really understand Sydney unless he grasps this fact.'' Knowing this, we understand why, for example, the first performance at the Sydney Opera House was given for construction workers. Or why, while the government supported America in the Vietnam War with troops, ''wharfies'' in Melbourne and Sydney occasionally refused to load ships bound for South Vietnam.</p>
        <p>Woven into the dense narrative are other telling historical details: how four merino sheep imported from San Francisco in 1793 were the making of Australia's economy; how the gold rushes of the 1850's first attracted the Chinese to Sydney; how it was only in 1975 that Aborigines were legally entitled to own land. (It took 17 more years for the Australian High Court to formally repudiate the concept of ''terra nullius,'' that the Europeans had arrived to colonize an empty land.) Moorhouse also shows how multicultural Sydney -- part of the ''last great social melting pot on earth'' -- has been layered by immigrants from every one of the countries it engulfs on that postcard map of Europe, and then some. One of the consequences, he writes, is that ''for a swelling proportion of citizens, the names of Luting, Dien Bien Phu and My Lai will always be much more evocative than those of Kokoda, Tobruk and Gallipoli.'' Another of the consequences is that, come September, no team in the Olympics will be short of home support in this most ravishing of cities, whose population already includes almost every nationality under the sun.</p>
