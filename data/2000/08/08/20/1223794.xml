      <abstract>
        <p>Katherine Saenger letter on novelist Ann Patchett's July 23 Lives essay recalls plight of Rose Wilder Lane, 1920's journalist who encouraged her mother, Laura Ingalls Wilder, to write her autobiography, which became Little House series</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The novelist Ann Patchett (Lives, July 23) writes about her mixed feelings as a ''midlist author'' whose mother's first novel turned out to be a near best seller. If Patchett thinks she has it bad, she ought to consider the case of poor Rose Wilder Lane, a journalist and best-selling author of the 1920's. Lane encouraged her 60-something mother to write her autobiography. Nearly 70 years later, the Laura Ingalls Wilder ''Little House'' books continue to enjoy steady sales, and Laura's daughter Rose is better known as a character in her mother's books than for any of her writings.</p>
