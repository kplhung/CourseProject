        <p>FAMKE JANSSEN -- like a roller coaster, tall and steeply curved -- is having herself a thrill ride of a summer. As Jean Grey, the telepathic, telekinetic protegee of Professor X, Ms. Janssen was part of the team that not only arrested the vengeful Magneto's quest for world domination in ''X-Men'' but had also raked in a superheroic $144 million at the box office in five weeks of release. Now, opening on Friday, comes Valerie Breiman's romantic comedy ''Love and Sex,'' a crowd pleaser at last winter's Sundance Festival.</p>
        <p>Until now, the Dutch-born, 5-foot-11-inch Ms. Janssen has been a specialist in scene-stealing supporting roles. Attentive viewers will remember that in a pair of movies in 1998 she played Petra, a louche gambler who throws herself against a bouldery Matt Damon in ''Rounders,'' and Bonnie, the book editor who serves as muse to the ungrateful Kenneth Branagh in Woody Allen's ''Celebrity.'' In her first memorable secondary role, she was Xenia Onatopp, the Bond bad girl who gleefully crushed her adversaries with her nutcracker thighs in ''Goldeneye'' (1995).</p>
        <p>But it is not so easy to keep ex-models who can actually act perpetually in supporting roles, and in ''Love and Sex,'' playing a character even more wildly imagined than a telekinetic mutant -- a sexually robust magazine writer named Kate with a messy personal life -- Ms. Janssen, 34, gets to break out.</p>
        <p>''Usually you just giggle or something when you read a script,'' Ms. Janssen said one afternoon last month in a SoHo restaurant, ''but this time I laughed out loud. I thought, I really want to be her. Besides, I had never been the female protagonist in a film, and I had never really done a romantic comedy. It all felt too good to be true.''</p>
        <p>It almost wasn't. Ms. Breiman, who makes her debut here as a feature-film writer and director, says her semi-autobiographical screenplay had been languishing for five years, with casting as one of the big hang-ups. On the verge of giving up hope, she went with friends to see ''Celebrity.''  ''I was so impressed how she managed to make something out of nothing,'' Ms. Breiman says of Ms. Janssen. ''And for a woman like that to be dumped by Kenneth Branagh! I immediately thought that this could be Kate.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Janssen is the type of woman who once might have been promoted as ''a thinking man's sex symbol.'' Certainly nothing about Ms. Janssen in person dispels the impression of cool intelligence. ''I don't watch TV,'' she confesses, adding tartly, ''There's certain things I try to avoid, as an actress, just to keep my world from being as narrow as it could be.''</p>
        <p>One of Ms. Breiman's first impressions of Ms. Janssen was that she was extremely well read (she favors the classics). But what drew Ms. Janssen to the part was that Kate didn't have all the answers, something with which she identified.</p>
        <p>''I loved the fact that Kate really is a mess, that she is confused and insecure and has issues with her life and men and her relationships. But it seemed new to me that she is very unapologetic about who she is, what she chooses to do, which men she decides to sleep with. She says: 'Well, this is who I am. You can like it or not, but I'm not apologizing.' And all my friends and family know me more as Kate than the other characters I've played. They all say, 'Oh, my God, we've finally seen a lot of you on the screen.' ''</p>
        <p>It seems to be only a temporary coincidence that at the moment Ms. Janssen's life is as unruly as her character's: she is unattached (she separated last year from her husband), homeless (she's apartment-hunting in lower Manhattan) and out of work (one film in the can, nothing else planned.)</p>
        <p>One of the more charming elements of ''Love and Sex'' is the relationship between Ms. Janssen and her co-star, the actor and comedian Jon Favreau. Their rapport is noticeable from their characters' initial attraction, through their head-over-heels period and on into tepidity, break-up, unsatisfactory best-friendship and back again.</p>
        <p>The two actors have a very realistic chemistry: she's sweet but a bit susceptible to overreaction; he's funny and laid back but acerbic. She, as she points out, has big feet; he, as he admits, has a big head. Given the short, 21-day shooting schedule, the chemistry is not something that could have been nurtured or, for that matter, faked. ''I knew she was beautiful and that she could act,'' Mr. Favreau says, ''but what I wasn't sure about was whether she could be funny. But as soon as I got to work with her and saw how real she was, I was sold. It's very rare to see someone who's both beautiful and funny.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Breiman says, ''Jon made Famke laugh in their scenes in a way that really made her laugh.''</p>
        <p>One scene that amused both actors comes at a point when their romance was starting to become commonplace. ''Originally it was just going to be the two of them in bed reading,'' Ms. Janssen explains. ''Then we thought, 'Why not make it funny?' '' They came up with the idea of one of them breaking wind. Originally, Mr. Favreau was to be the perpetrator and Ms. Janssen the one to respond. ''He said, 'I'll let you know when.' Which he never did, but instead made like I did it! And then I had to react. And of course Valerie kept it in. Which I love -- when the filmmaker is confident with moments that are spontaneous.''</p>
        <p>MS. JANSSEN (her first name, Famke, pronounced fam-KEY, means ''little girl'' in a provincial Dutch dialect) is one of three sisters in show business: her older sister, Antoinette, is a director, and her younger sister, Margolein, is an actress; both studied theater throughout their youth.</p>
        <p>''The way I got into it feels sort of like cheating compared to them,'' says Ms. Janssen, whose more circuitous path took her first to the University of Amsterdam to study economics. ''The Dutch are a very practical people,'' she says by way of explanation.</p>
        <p>Her year at the university proved to be, as she puts it, ''the stupidest idea I ever had.'' Soon she succumbed to those who had encouraged her to take up modeling, which eventually took her to America. Appearing on the covers of Elle, Mirabella and other fashion magazines, she made a lot of money and retired at the peak of her career, in the early 90's. She then enrolled at Columbia University to study literature and take up acting, but it was several years before she even began auditioning for parts.</p>
        <p>''I wanted to become good before I started,'' she says. ''I didn't want to fall on my face. I had seen what happened to other models.''</p>
        <p>She continues to bring the same cautious focus to choosing roles. ''I've learned not to take a part based on whether it could potentially be a big career move,'' she says. ''When the movie doesn't do well financially, you're left with an empty feeling, like you've wasted six months. I try to make decisions based on whether the director or the other actors are people I want to work with, or the character someone I want to play.''</p>
        <p>Thus she has ended up working with Woody Allen (''Celebrity'') and Robert Altman (''The Gingerbread Man''), John Irvin (''City of Industry'') and John Dahl (''Rounders''). She agreed to do ''X-Men'' because she wanted to work with the director Bryan Singer, whose work on ''The Usual Suspects'' she admired.</p>
        <p>''Comic book adaptations in the past have tended to get a little glossy and silly, and I knew he would never do it that way,'' she says. ''I thought his dark approach would be interesting.''</p>
        <p>NOT so surprising to hear from a thinking man's thinking person, ''dark'' is an adjective that pops up with some frequency in Ms. Janssen's aesthetic lexicon. The word might best describe a role she plays in Mr. Favreau's recently finished movie, ''Made,'' which he wrote and directed. It's a comedy about two aspiring boxers who become involved with low-level gangsters in a money-laundering scheme.</p>
        <p>''He said he'd write a part for me,'' she says, ''and he asked me what I wanted to be. I said I want to do something edgy, something dark, something different. So from that he wrote me a part as a stripper who's a single mother and who's had a drug problem in the past -- a dark, interesting character.</p>
        <p>''I'm intrigued by the dark,'' Ms. Janssen says. ''Out of darkness comes creation.''</p>
