        <p>THE maitre d'hotel at Coup, a swanky New American restaurant in the East Village, smiled as he fingered the coat check. Coup is a place of daring high-modern style, and one can only imagine what finery has passed through its coat room. Yet even so, this article cut a figure: sleek of line, cutting edge in design, of the moment and yet blue-collar practical.

        <p>The idea was to travel everywhere for one week on these two resin wheels, testing whether the stylish new scooters are a viable alternative to cabs and hoofing. Since arriving from Hong Kong at Christmas, the chrome Razor scooters, which go for about $100 a pop, have been selling out at both Toys ''R'' Us and the Sharper Image, appealing equally to superannuated kids and to the regular kind. With a handful of other manufacturers and distributors jumping on the Razorwagon, the devices have become a new form of transit for the masses. When historians recount New York's summer of 2000, they will tell of plaster cows and of grown professionals on little chrome scooters, a confluence of cutesy infantilism that made even the political conventions seem grown up.</p>
        <p>But on to the road test. As a mode of transportation, sadly, the scooter proved the stiletto heel of the two-wheeled set: great to look at, lousy for carrying laundry to the dry cleaner. Do not be seduced, as I was, by images of dapper men and women in graceful glide, cool breezes slicing through the hot city. Scootering is work, especially at rush hour. The small wheels bog down on the city's rough surfaces, and the base rides so low that a bump of any size becomes a potential obstacle. By the time I reached the office my first morning, a 40-block ride, I was drenched in perspiration, my knee was bruised from a near tumble and my hands ached as if I'd been working a jackhammer.</p>
        <p>These things I learned: cracks and seams in the sidewalk are not the scooterist's friend, a polite ''excuse me'' cuts you only so much slack and the scooterist's code is a subtle one. One afternoon, as I passed a fellow rider somewhat my junior -- by, say, about 30 years -- I threw him a fraternal salute. The boy stared back blankly and whizzed by. This, I figured, is the code of the road, at least when some crazy adult lets go of his handgrip, posing a threat to self and all around.</p>
        <p>And yet, as I glided down Murray Hill, weaving perilously among the scaffolds, I felt part of a new urban tribe, joined by our insouciant disregard for the slow pace of pedestrians.</p>
        <p>Fortune magazine reported last month that the Amish have taken to these new nonmotorized scooters for small errands, but while they may be an appealing alternative to buggies on the Pennsylvania Dutch back roads, the city scooter is a thing of freedom and menace all its own. Ours is a hardened attitude that says, ''I know it's raining, but I can't hold an umbrella and manage my scooter at the same time.'' Or perhaps just, ''Yes, I am insured.''</p>
        <p>As for the pavement-bound, they mostly didn't get it. Construction guys asked for a lift; others shot dirty looks, rightly fearing for their ankles.</p>
        <p>When I did impress a couple of gym bunnies on Eighth Avenue with my lapidary roll, they simply parked themselves in my path, astounded that they had just read ''a whole article'' about these gizmos in a men's fashion magazine.</p>
        <p>Fine. Now get out of my way. Sic transit Razor.</p>
        <p>I also learned that, contrary to what you might think, it is actually the stationary leg, not the pushing one, that gets the more rigorous workout. Or rather, the gluteal muscles attached to that leg. If you aren't careful to switch legs from time to time, you might find that your seated position begins to lean to the left or right, poor form in most any occupation.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, once you get the hang of it, there is real fetishistic satisfaction in unfolding the finely machined frame -- every bar and bolt sliding silently into place -- and in breaking it down again before entering the Metropolitan Museum or your local noodle house. For those of us who have never had call to assemble a high-powered weapon in a James Bond movie, this seems the next best thing.</p>
        <p>In the end, steady rains and the scooter-related return of an old repetitive-strain injury cut my experiment short. It was a relief to rejoin the slow-moving ranks of the asphalt-bound. As a trend, scootermania properly belongs in the category of irrational mob behavior, like soccer rioting or Capri pants: one person starts shouting something, an alpha male does this or that and before you know it, everybody is on scooters. I was ready to get off the razor's edge.</p>
        <p>But before I pass my scooter along to my 12-year-old son, there are still a few New York environs I'd like to try on wheels. Right now I'm weighing the ''1900'' exhibition at the Guggenheim. See you there, and stay out of my path.</p>
