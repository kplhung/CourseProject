        <p>IT'S easy to get people in the construction trades to laugh. All you have to do is ask them to narrow down the contents of their tool boxes to a single item.</p>
        <p>Once they're done guffawing, they're willing to talk.</p>
        <p>Warming to the topic, they will describe tools used most often, favorite tools, most practical, most fun and even dream tools. But there is always a caveat: one tool is not enough.</p>
        <p>''Tools are my life,'' said Richard Spaziante, owner of Conestoga Construction in Yonkers.</p>
        <p>Will Wahl of William Wahl Corporation, a White Plains plumbing business, gave the one-tool scenario a try, opting at first for a ruler. ''I could use it to measure a job,'' he said. ''I'd be able to give quotes.''</p>
        <p>He quickly added, however, that he would soon need a second tool -- a telephone. ''I'd have to call people to keep putting them off, because there's no way I can do a job with only one tool.''</p>
        <p>In a more serious vein, Mr. Wahl said that although he probably uses a saw more than anything else, channel-lock pliers are his favorites. ''They're versatile,'' he said. ''You can take things apart, fasten things. They're thin, so you can get them into places a pipe wrench can't go.''</p>
        <p>The humble ruler does have its fans. ''Whatever tool you start with is the one that remains most essential,'' said Louise Lidke, co-owner of Russell Interiors in White Plains. And after almost 40 years in construction, her partner, Richard Roessle, said a ruler was his must-have tool. ''Everything is measurement,'' he said. ''Just look around you: all the materials you see were measured to fit.''</p>
        <p>Tom Walsh, owner of Thomas J. Walsh Contracting in North Salem chose a compound miter saw as his No. 1 tool. ''That's my favorite,'' he said. ''It's fun to use, very accurate. You can make a lot of nice things with it. But you wouldn't need it on a desert island.''</p>
        <p>A hatchet is versatile, Mr. Walsh said, since it has a blade on one side and a hammer on the other. He calls it the best tool for getting back to the basics.</p>
        <p>If a hatchet were his only tool, Mr. Walsh said, ''I could still make a living as a renovator.''</p>
        <p>''I could knock down walls, cut wood to length, hammer,'' he said. ''I could still make something, primitive as it may be, but I could do it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Spaziante agreed. Without a hatchet, he said, ''you have nothing.''</p>
        <p>He continued: ''Call it a hatchet, an ax, a tomahawk, it's a great tool for survival. You can do anything you want with it: build a house, chop lumber, cut down a tree, dig out a canoe, dig in the earth. In the wilderness, it's the key of life. An ax is more important than anything.''</p>
        <p>Harvey Roy Goldberg, a painter who works for Westchester Decorators in Yonkers, also chose a simple tool as the one he couldn't do without: a four-inch paintbrush.</p>
        <p>Recalling that during his apprenticeship he learned how to do all types of painting with a large brush, he said: ''If you learned the trade the right way, you could do anything with that brush. If you have to spackle, you could use a piece of wood or a piece of cardboard, if you had to. But you couldn't paint without that brush.'' It would even come in handy for the decorative painting Mr. Goldberg specializes in, like wood graining, glazing and fake limestone finishes. ''If you had to, you could fake it with a four-inch brush,'' he said with a laugh.</p>
        <p>Nicholas Smacchia, owner of Plastering by Nicholas in Thornwood, said his favorite piece of equipment was a portable screw gun. ''It's always at my side,'' he said. ''I use it for mixing plaster and paint, screwing into wood lath, sheet rocking, drilling -- it's a big part of everything I do.</p>
        <p>''Portable tools are the biggest improvement of the last decade,'' he added. ''It really frees me up. I'm not always tripping over the wires. I don't always have electricity where I'm working.''</p>
        <p>Ed Snyder, owner of Southeast Electricians in Brewster, is also a cordless-tool fan. His favorite is a battery-operated drill. He uses the drill so much that he carries a brand-new, back-up model in his truck, just in case something goes wrong with his old one. ''The battery drill saves both work and time,'' he said. ''It makes life easier. I love my battery drill. I love my dogs better, but my battery drill comes in second.''</p>
        <p>Richard Kramer, a Yonkers-based carpenter, said his favorite tool is one he doesn't own yet: a portable combination thickness planer and edge joiner. He owns a separate planer and a joiner but is praying for them to break, so he will have a reason to acquire his dream tool.  Reciting the advantages of the combined tool, he said: ''It's heavier, more balanced, the bed is longer so it can handle larger stock and be more stable.''</p>
        <p>Excitement is audible in his voice when he talks about transporting the tool to job sites to work on fine-quality finish work and trim.</p>
        <p>That kind of enthusiasm is a big part of acquiring tools for professionals and do-it-yourselfers alike.</p>
        <p>''It's a macho thing,'' Mr. Smacchia said, ''and that even applies to women, when it comes to tools. People see pros using tools and want to own the same thing themselves. Sometimes you buy the tool before you really need it, then build the job around the tool.''</p>
