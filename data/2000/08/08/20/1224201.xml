        <p>In December 1986, three black men leaving a pizza parlor in predominantly white Howard Beach, Queens, were attacked by a pack of white teenagers screaming racial epithets and wielding a baseball bat. One victim was severely beaten, another outran his pursuers and the third was struck and killed by a passing car when he was chased onto the Belt Parkway.</p>
        <p>Today, two of the three attackers who were convicted in the death of Michael Griffith, who was 23, are still in prison. And the victim whose speed enabled him to avoid the assailants' fists and bat, Timothy Grimes, then 18, is also in prison, in Virginia. He is serving 36 years for shooting and seriously wounding his brother in 1988 and for later assaulting fellow prisoners.</p>

        <p>In December 1986, three black men leaving a pizza parlor in predominantly white Howard Beach, Queens, were attacked by a pack of white teenagers screaming racial epithets and wielding a baseball bat. One victim was severely beaten, another outran his pursuers and the third was struck and killed by a passing car when he was chased onto the Belt Parkway.</p>
        <p>Today, two of the three attackers who were convicted in the death of Michael Griffith, who was 23, are still in prison. And the victim whose speed enabled him to avoid the assailants' fists and bat, Timothy Grimes, then 18, is also in prison, in Virginia. He is serving 36 years for shooting and seriously wounding his brother in 1988 and for later assaulting fellow prisoners.</p>
        <p>The man beaten with the bat, Cedric Sandiford, who was 36 when he was attacked, died in 1991 of an unrelated illness.</p>
        <p>Jon Lester, Scott Kern and Jason Ladone were found guilty of manslaughter and assault. The sentences were 10 to 30 years for Mr. Lester, later reduced to 10 to 20; 6 to 18 years for Mr. Kern; and 5 to 15 years for Mr. Ladone.</p>
        <p>After serving 10 years, Mr. Ladone, 29,  was freed in April -- not because he was granted parole, but because a prisoner who has behaved behind bars must be released after serving two-thirds of the maximum term.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ladone, who is living in Queens, could not be reached for comment. His lawyer, Ronald Rubinstein, said last week, ''It was a draconian sentence, an injustice.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lester, 31, who has served 12 years, has agreed that he will not fight deportation to England, where he was born, if he receives a parole when he is next considered for one in October, said his lawyer, Bryan F. Levinson. . He said Mr. Lester  ''accepts responsibility and is sorry'' for his crimes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kern, 31, has served 10 years. He was last rejected for parole in January, and will not be considered for it again until early 2002.</p>
