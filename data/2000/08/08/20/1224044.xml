        <p>There is a barroom bard whose given name is Clarence Pope 3rd. He may be found in most any saloon at most anytime within the precincts of Manhattan. He is known as CP3.</p>
        <p>It is easy to underestimate this man by his appearance: the battered red leather shoes, the Army fatigues, the two matted braids that hang down to his thighs, the missing left incisor, the woolen goatee shooting in every direction, the horn-rimmed glasses stained by the fingers of a crooked right hand, all topped off by an African-style yellow cap.</p>

        <p>There is a barroom bard whose given name is Clarence Pope 3rd. He may be found in most any saloon at most anytime within the precincts of Manhattan. He is known as CP3.</p>
        <p>It is easy to underestimate this man by his appearance: the battered red leather shoes, the Army fatigues, the two matted braids that hang down to his thighs, the missing left incisor, the woolen goatee shooting in every direction, the horn-rimmed glasses stained by the fingers of a crooked right hand, all topped off by an African-style yellow cap.</p>
        <p>His gait is slanted and he usually carries an oversized plastic bag. Stray bits of paper protrude from his jacket pockets. It is easy to think he is a bagman, and drinkers often wonder what he carries in the satchel. The contents reveal an educated man concerned with current events and political polemics. There are four newspapers, a manuscript, sundry birthday cards and reams and reams of poems.</p>
        <p>''If we were all poets, we would starve on our own words,'' said CP3, who is 55. He suggests that the desktop dilettantes leave the wordsmithing to the professionals, since bad poetry is more painful than bad feet.</p>
        <p>Even the venerable CP3 does not feed himself with the word but with monthly pension checks he receives from the Transit Authority for his two decades of service as a token booth attendant. His income is augmented by the birthday cards he distributes in the bars around town.</p>
        <p>CP3 can list more saloons than probably appear in the Yellow Pages, and he knows a thousand people who visit them.  He knows their troubles, drinking habits and birthdays. And when someone's birthday rolls around, CP3 will visit this drinker's favorite watering holes, asking people to sign their well-wishes to a card that he will hand-deliver.</p>
        <p>''I've seen so much death in my time that I only do the birthday cards for the benefit of peace on earth,'' said CP3, a veteran of the Vietnam War. He does not ask for, but does accept, small gratuities from ''the people who's cool'': people who understand that kindness is not a virtue but a habit that needs to be encouraged.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday evenings, CP3 can be found at the Night Cafe on Amsterdam Avenue at Duke Ellington Boulevard, where he plays in a pool league. It is ''a place for all types from the brokers to the broken, anyone and everyone, they serve all kinds,'' said CP3, who is carrying 27 birthday cards in the pocket of his Army jacket.</p>
        <p>''This place makes me feel good because Manhattan bars are turning bad, so bad,'' he said. ''Too full of yuppies.''</p>
        <p>Not so at the Night Cafe. They do not allow the smoking of clove cigars there.</p>
        <p>Yuppies = Crackheads is the poet's formula. ''They're both based on greed,'' CP3 says. ''You only meet their front, their facade. They both ruined Midtown drinking.''</p>
        <p>As for drinking and longevity, CP3 offers these lines: With booze you can't lose./Though if it's consciousness you choose/Wine and beer/Will keep you here.</p>
