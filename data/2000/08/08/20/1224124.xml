        <p>The steady chirping of crickets, the ''caw caw'' of crows and the distant laughter of children rowing boats along a lake are all that can be heard on most days at the Sharpe Reservation in Fishkill, N.Y.</p>
        <p>But last Monday the quiet of the drizzly afternoon was pierced by carpenters pounding nails into the plywood layer of a roof. They were building a new 7,650-square-foot dining hall at Camp Tommy, which serves 120 boys aged 12 to 15 during four two-week sessions each summer.</p>
        <p>The hammering and sawing at the dining hall is one of several projects financed by a $2.5 million donation the fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger made last year to the Fresh Air Fund, a nonprofit agency that has been giving free summer vacations to lower-income children from New York City since 1877. The donation was intended to help the fund renovate and expand the camp, which had been named Camp Pioneer when it opened 50 years ago but was renamed for Mr. Hilfiger after his donation. It is one of five camps on the reservation run by the Fresh Air Fund. A first-aid cabin, new housing and a program center for career skills courses are being built as part of the expansion; other housing at the camp is being refurbished as well.</p>
        <p>Last Monday, Mr. Hilfiger took a day off from designing his spring 2001 line so that he, his daughter Ally, 16, a counselor at another Fresh Air Fund camp, and a few Hilfiger employees could see the progress of the two-year construction project, which began in July of last year.</p>
        <p>He also spoke to a career awareness class and a video production class, recounting how he managed to build his fashion empire -- the second largest in the country after Ralph Lauren -- despite several setbacks. He told the campers that as long as they worked hard toward their goals, they could achieve their dreams. ''The only reason I'm here today is that I persevered,'' he said. ''I kept pushing when times were hard and people said there's no way to succeed.''</p>
        <p>The camp's director, Richard Williams, showed them the new program center, where campers take courses in computer science, creative writing, digital photography and video production and music appreciation. ''This would not be possible without this facility,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''I love it,'' said Mr. Hilfiger, who had not seen the buildings until last week. ''I love the rough-hewn construction.''</p>
        <p>Children said their favorite change at the camp was the new housing -- particularly the showers. ''The new showers have dividers and they have mirrors,'' said Raheem Richardson, a 13-year-old from the Canarsie section of Brooklyn who has spent two summers at the camp. ''The old ones, there was no way to keep people from seeing you.''</p>
        <p>The $2.5 million donation was the largest one received for capital improvements to Camp Tommy and Camp Anita Bliss Coler, a 46-year-old camp for 9- to 12-year-old girls.  Mr. Williams said that in addition to upkeep and improvements, the fund spent an average of $1,036 for each child at a camp.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hilfiger said he made his donation because he wanted the children to have a chance to get a head start in the real world. ''I hope they will be able to realize that there is opportunity in this life,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams, the camp's director, said the renovations and donations were a godsend.</p>
        <p>''We have kids on Ritalin. We have kids who are H.I.V. positive. We have  kids from homeless shelters,'' he said. ''When you help those that are most at risk, the reward is greater, far greater.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams, introducing Mr. Hilfiger to his campers as they gathered to eat lunch, said: ''As far as I know, these buildings don't grow like trees. They happen because people make them happen.''</p>
        <p>Anyone interested in making a tax-deductible contribution to the agency may send a check to the Fresh Air Fund, 1040 Avenue of the Americas, New York, N.Y. 10018, call (800) 367-0003 or visit the agency's Web site, www.freshair.org.</p>
