        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>In all the appreciations of Tiger Woods, I haven't read any comments on his remarkable personal style.</p>
        <p>He is so young, only 24, and yet, unlike his contemporaries in the sports world, has no piercings or tattoos. His closely cut hair relates to no fashion or macho trend. On or off the links, he dresses in a timeless, classy way, and is so very well-spoken.</p>

        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>In all the appreciations of Tiger Woods, I haven't read any comments on his remarkable personal style.</p>
        <p>He is so young, only 24, and yet, unlike his contemporaries in the sports world, has no piercings or tattoos. His closely cut hair relates to no fashion or macho trend. On or off the links, he dresses in a timeless, classy way, and is so very well-spoken.</p>
        <p>I am so relieved, for once, to be presented with an athlete with class. No swaggering braggadocio. No disgusting exultant exhibitions. No trash-talking. When he won the British Open, completing his historic Grand Slam, he took time to console David Duval, reminding him that he was a champion. He then gave a few low-key comments to an interviewer, saying it was an enjoyable victory, and very special to do it in the birthplace of golf.</p>
        <p>That's why I love Tiger Woods. He is an utter aristocrat, a perfect gentleman.</p>
