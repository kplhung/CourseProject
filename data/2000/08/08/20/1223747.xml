        <p>1. Given a preview of these photos, John Richardson, the art critic and Picasso expert who knew Peggy Guggenheim and has stayed at her palazzo, offered these reality checks: first, she favored Fortuny, since the designer was conveniently located in Venice. Second, he dryly noted that Guggenheim never would have ended up with a gondolier in her bed. At the time, the gents famously moonlighted by preparing corpses for burial.  2. Guggenheim's flamboyant jewelry collection included pieces designed for her by Alexander Calder and Yves Tanguy, and by local Italian artisans, like the jewelry in this shot. The Murano-based jewelers Marina and Susanna Sent use traditional Venetian-glass blowing techniques to craft one-of-a-kind accessories. Their studio number in Venice is 011-39-041-5274665. Sunglasses, $200, at all Fendi stores.</p>

        <p>3. Though extravagant with her wardrobe and jewelry, Guggenheim was apparently less so with foodstuffs. According to a relative, she got a great deal on a bulk shipment of canned sardines and for months served them every day at the palazzo. On a journey through India, she fell in love with papadums, a crispy, waferlike bread, for their light weight and low price. She ordered a gondola-load and ended up nibbling her way through stale, canal-dampened papadums for the next two years.  4. Her passion for collecting lovers and artworks was probably outshone only by the passion she felt for her family of Lhasa apsos. One of our furry models, Magic Boy di Cerretelle, is no garden-variety mannequin. The Italian champion is carried everywhere by his handlers and generally coddled just as much as any of Guggenheim's ''darling babies,'' who are all buried in the garden near their mistress.  5. Michele Hicks was happy to let the canine camera hog share model billing, because she would rather be called an actress. She has completed production on Matthew Brown's independent feature ''Ropewalk,'' with Peter Facinelli and Ever Carradine.  6. Guggenheim's home in Venice, which now houses the Peggy Guggenheim Collection, was actually an unfinished palace made of white stone and covered with vines. It never grew beyond one level, which gave the building a sleeker, more modernist look than that of its neighbors (and gave Guggenheim a huge, flat roof on which to sunbathe, much to the amusement of a local prefect, whose headquarters was directly opposite). The prefect may not have been quite so amused by Guggenheim's infamous Marino Marini bronze sculpture ''The Angel of the City,'' which depicts a man on horseback with a very large, very erect and conveniently removable phallus (see previous pages). On special holy days, when the Patriarch and nuns were nearby, Guggenheim sometimes remembered to unscrew the appendage and hide it in a drawer. Local lore claims that she had a whole collection of variously sized phalluses for different occasions. Could this be what inspired the band King Missile to write their song ''Detachable Penis''?  7. Art historian Leo Steinberg wrote in Guggenheim's guest book that her palazzo was the only house in Venice that did not make one ashamed to be of the 20th century, and Philip Johnson scribbled that hers was the only building he would trade for his famous Glass House, in New Canaan, Conn. Guggenheim's friend Princess Pignatelli agreed with their assessments, but only if Guggenheim ''would throw all those awful pictures into the Grand Canal.'' Twentieth-century-art lovers can be thankful the princess didn't get her way.  8. The guest books (a), signed by and doodled in by almost every art and literary luminary of the 50's, 60's and the 70's, are the stuff of legend. There are scrawls by Tennessee Williams and drawings by Chagall, Cocteau, Miro and Brauner (left). Fancy yourself a grand host? Leatherbound guest book (b), $285, at Asprey &amp; Garrard, 725 Fifth Avenue.</p>
