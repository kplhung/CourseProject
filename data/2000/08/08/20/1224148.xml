        <p>In the five and a half years that Bernard B. Kerik held the proverbial key to the New York City jail system, first as the top deputy and then as commissioner of the Department of Correction, slashings and stabbings fell by 93 percent. Overtime pay plummeted by 44 percent. Trends were monitored, statistics compiled.</p>
        <p>If that sounds familiar, it might be because Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's choice of a new police commissioner is regarded as a man much like the mayor himself. As commissioner and first deputy, Mr. Kerik was charged with matching the decline in crime on the streets with a decline in violence in the city jails, which were seen as abysmal. By most accounts, he succeeded, transforming what had traditionally been a chaotic department into one of the best-managed agencies in the city.</p>
        <p>A former undercover narcotics detective who would wear six diamond earrings and greasy mechanic's coveralls when making a buy, Mr. Kerik, 44, knows how to navigate the streets. He received the Police Department's Medal of Valor after a 1991 drug bust in Washington Heights: a cocaine dealer, cornered by Mr. Kerik and his partner, Hector Santiago, unexpectedly leapt from a taxi and started shooting, hitting Mr.  Santiago once in the elbow. Mr. Kerik jumped from his car and chased the gunman into a housing project two blocks away, all the while dodging bullets and returning the fire. The dealer finally collapsed, next to six kilos of cocaine.</p>
        <p>Mr. Santiago credits Mr. Kerik with saving his life. ''There was a bitter taste in my mouth, because there were some officers that didn't do what they had to do,'' Mr. Santiago said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerik was also part of undercover operations that led to the arrest of members of the Colombian Cali cocaine cartel.</p>
        <p>Bernard Bailey Kerik was born in Paterson, N.J., in 1956. He dropped out of high school and enlisted in the Army, serving in the military police and training members of the Special Forces in karate (he holds a black belt). After about four years working as an investigator and a guard for Saudi Arabian royalty, he returned to New Jersey, where he became warden of the Passaic County Jail. Mr. Kerik took a $27,000 pay cut to join the New York Police Department in 1985.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerik joined the  Department of Correction in 1994 as the director of investigations. He was appointed first deputy commissioner in 1995 and commissioner in late 1997.</p>
        <p>He has since trimmed his ponytail and exchanged his grubby work clothes for immaculate suits and heavily starched shirts. But colleagues say he is still nimble, still in touch with the man on the street. He consults with subordinates, hears out union leaders and subjects longstanding policies to the scrutiny of reason.</p>
        <p>''I will say one thing for Kerik, which is that he gives me an open door,'' said Peter Meringolo, the president of the Correction Captains Association. ''Unfortunately, that hasn't always been done.''</p>
        <p>Five years ago, Mr. Meringolo went so far as to crown Mr. Kerik man of the year at an annual union dinner dance -- the only time a manager has received the honor.</p>
        <p>Once he has a plan, though, Mr. Kerik executes it with determination, penalizing those who do not comply.</p>
        <p>Convinced that the department's battered buses were contributing to its negative public image, he declared that only spotless vehicles be allowed off Rikers Island. When Mr. Kerik stepped out of the department's Hudson Street headquarters one day to see a rusty old agency truck outside with a shabbily dressed driver asleep behind the wheel, he spun around and informed the responsible warden that he would be using the truck in lieu of his Crown Victoria for the next month. And the warden would be doing his own driving.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerik's biggest accomplishment has been the drastic reduction in violence in the city's jails, where inmates used to frequently slash and stab one another -- and sometimes the guards -- with homemade weapons. Brutality by the guards was also a problem, as some took the offensive and began beating unruly inmates.</p>
        <p>In the past, inmates usually just got time in special confinement wards for such behavior, but Mr. Kerik began pushing to prosecute them for new crimes in these cases. He also equipped guards with powerful and somewhat controversial weapons like stun shields to subdue violent inmates.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerik brought to the jails a version of the Police Department's Compstat program, in which practices are altered and resources allocated in accordance with carefully monitored trends. In the beginning, he used the program to stop much of the violence by inmates. He then expanded the idea into a tool for holding managers at all levels of the department responsible for their actions.</p>
        <p>At monthly meetings, Mr. Kerik holds wardens accountable for what takes place in their jails, demanding that they know who is there and can explain a spike in overtime pay or even a delay in fixing a jail bathroom. The approach, called Teams, for Total Efficiency Accountability Management System, is a semifinalist in an annual competition at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard that rewards innovations in government.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerik has told friends that he plans to expand the Police Department's use of Compstat to monitor and improve not just crime-fighting but community relations.</p>
        <p>Another area on which he is likely to focus is reducing overtime. Using his Teams approach, Mr. Kerik has cut the annual overtime budget at the Correction Department to about $50 million, or about half what it was when the jails seemed to be exploding with violence in 1990. By contrast, the Police Department's overtime costs have mushroomed in recent years.</p>
        <p>According to his critics, changes in the city's jails may have more to do with legal pressure than the commissioner's desire to make things better.</p>
        <p>''From our standpoint, his administration has been a very mixed bag,'' said John Boston, the director of the Prisoners' Rights Project at the Legal Aid Society of New York City. ''His candor was refreshing, but I think his accomplishments have been somewhat exaggerated.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Boston said the department has exhibited an ''overall lack of consistent effort'' to investigate and punish the use of excessive force by jail staff members, even as the situation has improved at those jails that have been the subject of legal scrutiny. ''How you translate that into what would happen at the Police Department, I'm really not in a position to say,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Some within the force wonder whether Mr. Kerik will find it difficult to command respect in a department that he left as a detective third grade, the lowest rank of detective. And while captains in the department must have a college degree, Mr. Kerik is pursuing his now at Empire State College, where he is 24 credits shy of a bachelor's degree in labor relations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerik's supporters say the man is every bit as great as the action-figure image depicted in the numerous press clippings he received as head of correction. Friends say he is a devoted father to his 15-year-old son from a previous marriage and the baby daughter who lives with Mr. Kerik and his current wife, Halah, in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. He works out daily and drinks coffee incessantly -- half regular, half hazelnut, with half and half. And if the waitress says she does not have any half and half, Mr. Kerik, ever resourceful, politely suggests that she mix regular milk and full cream to get the desired effect.</p>
        <p>''Bernie Kerik brings new insight, new vision,'' said Lenny Lemer, a sergeant with the Police Department who has known Mr. Kerik for 12 years. ''The same insight and vision that he brought to the Department of Correction, he can bring to the New York City Police Department. We're in an era where we really need to deal with the community maybe on a different level.''</p>
