        <p>After staging a rally today in his home state of Texas to underscore the strength of his political base, Gov. George W. Bush traveled to New Mexico, a state President Clinton won twice, to announce a proposal to repair crumbling schools on the nation's Indian reservations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, met here with representatives from Indian pueblos and tribes and told them that as president, he would pressure Congress to spend $802 million to repair the 185 schools on tribal lands, most of which are managed by the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs. He also called for spending an additional $126 million to replace the six most decrepit schools in the system.</p>
        <p>''Throughout our history, Native Americans have seen many promises broken and many promises forgotten,'' he said. ''The latest promises unfulfilled are in the schools on the reservations. In a Bush administration, the federal government will meet its responsibilities to Native American children.''</p>
        <p>The amount of money involved is relatively small compared with other education initiatives that Mr. Bush and his rival, Vice President Al Gore, have made. But it allowed Mr. Bush to sustain his focus on education.</p>
        <p>The issue, more traditionally associated with Democrats, was one that Mr. Bush had said he would focus on in the next two weeks. His aides announced today that on Monday the campaign would begin airing two television commercials about education in 21 states, many of which have voted Democratic in the past.</p>
        <p>It is largely through education proposals that Mr. Bush has styled himself as a compassionate conservative and staked his claim to being at the center of the political spectrum.</p>
        <p>The issue is one on which the candidates disagree sharply. Mr. Bush supports vouchers that poor families can use for private-school tuition, saying it will force public schools to improve. Mr. Gore says vouchers will drain needed resources away from public schools.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Bush participated in three public events in two states over the course of a day that kept him on go for about 12 hours, one aide presented reporters with statistics meant to show that Mr. Bush had been covering more ground and connecting with more voters than Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>The aide, Scott McClellan, was clearly trying to rebut suggestions that Mr. Gore was a brisker, more energetic campaigner than Mr. Bush, who had an abbreviated public schedule on Friday, his first day back on the stump after the Democratic National Convention.</p>
        <p>The statistics set off a bizarre, sometimes comical tit-for-tat between the Bush and Gore camps about methodology and what should and should not be counted as a campaign event; what were and were not analogous periods of time; and the relative merits of travel by train (Mr. Bush's mode of transportation after the Republican convention) and by boat (Mr. Gore's vehicle out of the Democratic gathering).</p>
        <p>Mr. McClellan said Mr. Bush had been able to stop in more cities and towns in the days after the convention because of ''a top speed of 75 miles per hour compared with 7 miles per hour.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's post-convention train trip, Mr. McClellan said, brought the governor to five states, representing 138 electoral votes, and included 22 rallies or other events, while Mr. Gore's boat trip would bring him to four states, representing 51 electoral votes, and would include 8 rallies or similar events.</p>
        <p>Mr. McClellan said the comparison demonstrated ''how hard the candidates are working coming out of their conventions'' and said that Mr. Bush and his running mate. Dick Cheney, would visit 19 states in the second half of August.</p>
        <p>''If Al Gore thinks that playing follow the leader has been difficult up until now, he ain't seen nothing yet,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But the estimate that the Bush campaign provided for their own candidate was over seven days, while the estimate it provided for Mr. Gore was over four days. Mr. Gore's aides said that over the seven days following the Democratic convention, the vice president would visit six states, representing 87 electoral votes, and conducting 20 events.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the vice president, Chris Lehane, said: ''Al Gore has been literally campaigning 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for a year. We do not take time out of our days so we we can play computer games or sleep with our own pillows, as Governor Bush seems to do.''</p>
        <p>The rally this morning in Dallas, at Southern Methodist University, the alma mater of Mr. Bush's wife, Laura, was the second part of a two-day campaign trip in which Mr. Bush is seeking to temper any momentum Mr. Gore gained at the Democratic National Convention. In a poll of 806 registered voters that was taken on Aug. 17 and Aug. 18 and commissioned by Newsweek magazine, Mr. Gore led Mr. Bush in a four-way race by six percentage points, with 48 percent to Mr. Bush's 42. The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.</p>
        <p>The itinerary itself was a dig at Mr. Gore. Mr. Bush traveled to Tennessee on Friday to highlight that some polls show him leading Mr. Gore in his home state.</p>
        <p>Today's rally in Dallas was meant to draw a contrast by showing the strength of Mr. Bush's support in his home base.</p>
        <p>''Listen to people who know them best,'' read a banner behind the podium.</p>
