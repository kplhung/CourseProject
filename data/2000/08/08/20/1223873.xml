        <p>AFTER three months of hand wringing and the threat of layoffs because of a $26 million gap in this year's school budget, the Yonkers school system got a reprieve when Gov. George E. Pataki came to town with a $10 million check for the school district.</p>
        <p>The money from Albany, coupled with a retirement incentive for senior staff and cuts in programs, ended the crisis for this year at least.</p>
        <p>Still, alternative programs for middle- school and ninth-grade students will be lost, as will a program aimed at students with attention deficit disorder; 238 experienced teachers, administrators and staff are retiring early, and the opening of two renovated schools scheduled for this fall will be postponed.</p>
        <p>Between those adjustments, which saved about $16 million, and the aid from the Governor, interim Superintendent Joseph Farmer said he was able to close the budget gap -- a feat that appeared nearly impossible two months ago when he took over the district.</p>
        <p>All told, the final Yonkers budget for this year will be $343 million.</p>
        <p>''I asked the school board to allow me a little more time before presenting my own doomsday budget to try and bring all the parties together, and they did that,'' Mr. Farmer said.</p>
        <p>He then held several meetings with Mayor John D. Spencer, who had forced out the last superintendent, and lawyers from the N.A.A.C.P. to talk about settling the district's long-standing desegregation lawsuit -- an issue that proved to be the undoing of former Superintendent Andre J. Hornsby, who refused to settle.</p>
        <p>Key to getting the money from Albany was this agreement, Mr. Farmer said. The $10 million check is actually an advance on whatever the final settlement amount will be.</p>
        <p>Mr. Farmer also suggested that the school district's efforts this summer to trim its budget by $16 million registered as a sign of good faith with the governor.</p>
        <p>''By us reducing the budget by $16 million, without help from the outside, showed that we were serious about this,'' he said. ''I think the key was this team effort of everybody.''</p>
        <p>Even those who remain unhappy with the mayor and the ouster of Dr. Hornsby say they are relieved -- for the moment.</p>
        <p>''The mayor took a gamble that we would get help from the state at the last minute, and the last horse came in,'' said Maria Chiulli, a school board member who has repeatedly denounced Mr. Spencer's involvement in school affairs. ''I'm very happy we got the money, but I look at it this way: I don't like the crisis situation we always seem to be in. As far as I'm concerned, we're already in a hole for next year.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Farmer said the district's settlement funds -- whenever they come -- will be paid over a number of years, as opposed to arriving in one lump sum, to lend a measure of predictability and stability to school finances.</p>
