        <p>Vice President Al Gore would give more unqualified support to the United Nations and be more willing to sign international treaties than his Republican opponent, George W. Bush, an independent United Nations watchdog organization said this week.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gore is still hedging his support for some important international initiatives, as President Clinton did when he met stiff resistance from Republicans in Congress.</p>
        <p>The group, the Campaign for United Nations Reform, which is based in Washington, sent both major candidates in this year's race a comprehensive questionnaire on topics involving United States participation in international affairs. Congressional candidates were also polled.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush replied in a brief letter to Don Kraus, executive director of the Campaign for United Nations Reform, saying that while he believed that international organizations can serve the cause of peace, he would never place American troops under United Nations command. He would pay United States debts to the organization, he said, only when its bureaucracy has been reformed and American dues lowered. He also said that he wanted reforms at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, but he did not elaborate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore responded to more than a dozen questions, often at some length. He said that it was time the United States paid its dues to the United Nations ''in full, on time and without conditions.'' He added that there had already been substantial reforms in the United Nations system. He said that agencies of the United Nations ''offer the U.S. an effective means of doing our fair share to alleviate suffering in some of the most miserable corners of the globe.''</p>
        <p>On outstanding treaties not signed by the United States, Mr. Gore gave unequivocal support to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Law of the Sea Treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty to stop the testing of nuclear arms.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gore continued to call for changes in an international agreement banning land mines, reflecting longstanding objections from the Pentagon. And he declined to endorse the International Criminal Court, now taking shape without American support. His said in his reply that the court's treaty still had ''significant flaws.''</p>
        <p>The Campaign for United Nations Reform is a 25-year-old organization that advocates stronger American support for the United Nations.</p>
        <p>Among Congressional responses to the organization's questionnaire, attitudes to the United Nations ranged very widely, said Jennifer Taylor, program director for the campaign. Some members of Congress were very supportive of the United Nations adherence to international treaties. But others, a small minority, responded by advocating that the United States quit the organization, which they said did not serve American interests.</p>
