        <p>Amid its human-scale skyline, century-old cafes, pedestrian streets and lush gardens, Copenhagen still finds room for contradictions. That's to be expected from a city that nurtured both Hans Christian Andersen and Soren Kierkegaard.</p>

        <p>Amid its human-scale skyline, century-old cafes, pedestrian streets and lush gardens, Copenhagen still finds room for contradictions. That's to be expected from a city that nurtured both Hans Christian Andersen and Soren Kierkegaard.</p>
        <p>In a city under constant renewal, two dazzling avant-garde projects have been completed over the last 12 months: the dramatic Black Diamond addition to the Royal Library and the shimmering Danish Design Center. And a 10-mile bridge and tunnel connection to Malmo, Sweden, the Oresund Fixed Link, was inaugurated on July 1. It ties southern Sweden to the Continent for the first time.</p>
        <p>Founded in the 12th century, Copenhagen was nearly destroyed on several occasions, most notably by a fire in 1795 and the 1807 British bombardments during the Napoleonic wars. Thus, most of the city's neo-Classical architecture dates from the early 19th century, when Danish arts and letters flourished. Starting Friday and continuing through Sept. 10, the city celebrates the achievements of the years 1800 to 1850 with  the biennial Golden Days in Copenhagen Festival. In conjunction with the festival, the Copenhagen City Museum (Bymuseum) will unveil its renovated Kierkegaard Room on Friday, lengthening an already crowded museum roster.</p>
        <p>Because many museums and castles have limited hours, time-conscious visitors often have lunch at the convenient museum snack bars.  Nevertheless, getting to know this  city means at least one break for  smoerrebroed -- the open-face Danish sandwiches generally topped with fresh shrimp, herring or egg --  in a waterfront cafe in the recently gentrified Nyhavn quarter.</p>
        <p>Another essential taste of Copenhagen is found at the enchanting Tivoli amusement park, open through Sept. 24, with outdoor concerts and carnival rides.</p>
        <p>Events</p>
        <p>The Golden Days Festival unites 60 cultural institutions in Copenhagen. Highlights include exhibitions and performances in historic sites, notably the restaging of Bournonville's romantic ballet ''Kermesse in Bruges'' at the Royal Theater Aug. 31 and Sept. 4, 5 and 8. Tickets are $8 to $55, at 8 kroner to the dollar. Programs are available at www .goldendays.dk/english.</p>
        <p>Golden Days maps, in English, found at the tourist information center near Tivoli at 1 Bernstorffsgade, pinpoint architectural details like the sober pediments of the Christianborg Palace Chapel (1826) and the Egyptian ornamentation on the Krystalgade Synagogue (1833).</p>
        <p>The City Museum (Copenhagen Bymuseum), 59 Vesterbrogade, (45) 33 21 07 72, inaugurates its expanded Soren Kierkegaard room, with his  books and furnishings including his  desk, on Friday. Open Wednesday to Monday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.; after Oct. 1 from 1 to 4 p.m. Admission: $2.50; children free.</p>
        <p>''Symbolism in Danish and European Painting'' opens the fall season at the Statens Museum for Kunst  (Danish National Gallery), 48-50 Solvgade, (45) 33 74 84 94 or www.smk.dk, on Sept. 29, continuing through Jan. 14. With 80 paintings from 1870 to 1910, this exhibition includes works by Edvard Munch and the Danish masters Ejnar Nielsen,  Vilhelm Hammershoi and Joakim Skovgaard, whose ''Christ in the Realm of Death'' has just been restored by the museum. Open Tuesday to Sunday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Wednesday (free) until 8 p.m. Admission: $5, $7.50 with the exhibit.</p>
        <p>From Saturday to Oct. 17, the Royal Theater, Det Kongelige Teater, Kongens Nytorv, (45) 33 69 69 69, www.kgl-teater.dk, offers an intriguing double dance bill with a contemporary ballet choreographed by the former Paul Taylor star Lila York presented in tandem with the classic ''Giselle,'' performed by the Royal  Danish Ballet. Tickets: $6.25 to $43.75.</p>
        <p>The Danish diva Anne Margrethe Dahl stars in the Royal Theater's opulent production of Verdi's ''Traviata'' through Sept. 16. Tickets: $9.50 to $65.60.</p>
        <p>The Danish Design Center, 27 H. C. Andersens Boulevard, (45) 33 69 33 69, a showcase for the best of Danish and international design that opened in January, honors the 75th anniversary of the Danish electronics company Bang &amp; Olufsen through Sept. 17, with photographs, early advertising posters and pioneering designs -- including the Bauhaus-inspired Hyperbo 5RG combination radio-record player from 1934 and a sleek molded Bakelite radio from 1939 -- displayed alongside contemporary designs.  Open Monday through Friday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., weekends and holidays 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.; $3.75.</p>
        <p>Royal Copenhagen's headquarters  on the Stroget, 6 Amagertorv, (45) 33 13 71 81, the pedestrian shopping avenue in the center of town, is also popular. The porcelain firm honors the 225th anniversary of its signature Blue Fluted pattern with a new line of historic re-editions, and presents a retrospective exhibition through Sept. 2. Open Monday to Thursday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., Friday to 7 p.m., Saturday to 5 p.m., Sunday through September noon to 5 p.m. Free.</p>
        <p>Sightseeing</p>
        <p>Despite busloads of camera-toting admirers, the Little Mermaid appears justifiably disconsolate at being seated in the harbor across from an oil storage silo on the north edge of town. Nearby, the relatively unknown Danish Resistance Museum in Churchill Park, (45) 33 13 77 14,  details daily life in Denmark from 1940 to 1945. Open Tuesday to Saturday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and Sunday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m; after Sept. 16 Tuesday to Saturday 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. and Sunday 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Free.</p>
        <p>The Hirshsprung Collection, 20 Stockholmsgade, (45) 35 42 03 36, reopened in March after a year's renovation. The collection of 19th-century Danish painting and sculpture that belonged to the tobacco baron Heinrich Hirshsprung is housed in a neo-Classical-style mansion filled with furniture from the homes and studios of the artists.  Open Thursday to Monday 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. and Wednesday 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Admission: $3; children free.</p>
        <p>Fans of the Vikings can begin their Nordic quest at the National Museum, 10 Ny Vestergade, (45) 33 13 44 11, where runestones, jewelry, weapons and mummified remains from Viking graves are displayed with clear English explanations. The delicate Sun Chariot sculpture is one of the museum's major Bronze Age artifacts. Open Tuesday to Sunday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; $5; children free.</p>
        <p>Tivoli, 3 Vesterbrogade, (45) 33 15 10 01, has enchanted visitors since 1843 with its lavish flower gardens, fanciful pavilions, rides and numerous restaurants. Two Chinese-inspired attractions for children -- Dragon Boats and the Panda's Tower -- opened this year. The Valhalla Funhouse and the Viking Ships ride are much scarier. Open Sunday to Thursday 11 a.m. to midnight, Friday and Saturday 11 a.m. to 1 a.m. Closes Sept. 24 and reopens Nov. 17 to Dec. 23. Tickets: $5, children $2.50.</p>
        <p>Where to Stay</p>
        <p>The conveniently situated 51-room Hotel Danmark, 89 Vester Voldgade, (45) 33 11 48 06, fax (45) 33 14 36 30,  between Tivoli and the National Museum, offers a friendly welcome and uncluttered, traditional decor with bold colors. The typically tiny, spotless bathrooms have built-in hair dryers. The private garage ($9.40 a day) is a bonus. Doubles: $137.</p>
        <p>Near the Amalienborg Palace, the 366-room Copenhagen Admiral Hotel, 24-28 Toldbodgade, (45) 33 74 14 14, fax (45) 33 74 14 16, is housed in an 18th-century granary with atmospheric barrel-vaulted hallways. Harborside rooms offer views of cruise ships and sailboats. And although rooms derive great charm from 200-year-old rough-hewn pine beams, the  landmark wooden infrastructure means no air-conditioning. Amenities include a nightclub and sauna. Doubles: $128 to $164.</p>
        <p>Budget: A cheerful children's  playroom and an enclosed outdoor patio adjoin the dining room at Ibsen's Hotel, 23 Vendersgade, (45) 33 13 19 13, fax (45) 33 13 19 16, in a  residential district near the lush Botanical Gardens. Most of the 118 rooms display clean, no-frills Scandinavian design, although top-of-the-line suites have more ambitious decor and kitchenettes. The generous buffet breakfast is included in the room price. Doubles: $131 to $156.</p>
        <p>Luxury: The gracious Hotel  d'Angleterre, 34 Kongens Nytorv, (45) 33 12 00 95, fax (45) 33 12 11 18, was built in 1755 in the Grand Hotel  tradition. Its 124 rooms are decorated in a variety of styles; some with sumptuous canopy beds with French provincial textiles. The hotel has two restaurants, Internet access from rooms and an indoor pool and spa. Doubles: $287 to $449.</p>
        <p>While far smaller in its dimensions, the 84-room Nyhavn 71, 71 Nyhavn, (45) 33 43 62 00, fax (45) 33 43 62 01, exudes considerable antique charm. Its pint-size rooms, with exposed beams and colorful textiles, are squeezed into an 1804 warehouse on a scenic stretch of waterfront with views of the old naval base. Work is under way on a 44-room annex. Doubles: $187 to $224.</p>
        <p>Where to Eat</p>
        <p>The sleek, minimalist dining room in the Royal Library's new Black Diamond wing, 1 Soren Kierkegaards Plads, (45) 33 47 49 49, which opened in September, offers some of the city's most sophisticated cuisine. The menu includes grilled catfish paired with succulent Norwegian lobster, and superb smoked Baltic salmon with dill and scrambled eggs. Waterfront views are sensational at sunset, so ask for a window table. A three-course dinner for two with a modest bottle of wine is $113.</p>
        <p>In an upscale neighborhood of  power brokers and power shoppers, Cafe Zeze, 20 Ny Ostergade, (45) 33 14 23 90, serves eclectic European fare, like lamb filets topped with shiitake mushrooms and an exotic vegetarian pasta laced with coconut cream and hot chili pepper. While the lunch crowd is mostly suit-and-tie, this streamlined bistro attracts a  younger, cooler clientele after dark. Dinner and Tuborg for two: $45.</p>
        <p>Tourism has tamed the once disreputable Nyhavn waterfront, and open-air restaurants have ousted tattoo parlors and brothels. At Nyhavns Faergekro, 5 Nyhavn, (45) 33 15 15 88, the all-you-can-eat lunch buffet with 10 varieties of Scandinavian herring for $11 is one of the best seafood bargains in Copenhagen. The famous fish cakes with remoulade sauce or smoked lamb sandwiches, both $5.60, also make a fine light lunch. At dinner, there is a fixed-price two-course menu for $19.</p>
        <p>High ceilings and leaded-glass windows lend a lofty look to Cafeen I Nikolaj, 12 Nikolaj Plads, (45) 33 11 63 13, which serves down-to-earth Danish fare in a deconsecrated church site. The creamed seafood chowder is superb, and the classic lunch combinations of herring,  smoked eel, shrimp or salmon tartare never disappoint. Two for lunch will spend $35. It is open for dinner from spring to Sept. 2 with an expanded menu that includes steak tenderloin or lemon sole. Dinner for two with wine: $75.</p>
        <p>The Stroget takes its festive ambience from street mimes and musicians. At Cafe Europa, 1 Amagertorv, (45) 33 12 04 28, the outdoor tables are tantalizingly close to the Royal Copenhagen and Georg Jensen showrooms. An oversized Danish sandwich topped with marinated artichoke, sun-dried tomato, roasted eggplant and fresh basil costs $8. A glass of wine or beer is $3.50. (No reservations.)</p>
