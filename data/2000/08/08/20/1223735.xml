      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>J. R. Salamanca's deft and sprightly new novel, THAT SUMMER'S TRANCE (Welcome Rain, $24.95), is full of theatrical flourishes. Indeed, the book's protagonist, Ben Oakshaw, was once a talented actor and is now the owner of a major Washington advertising agency; he has deliberately buried ''the true and terrible privation of his youth,'' which was spent on a Florida sweet potato farm, in ''a skillful impersonation'' of success so convincing that it almost -- but never completely -- quiets his sense of inadequacy and self-doubt. When Jill, his lover during his student days at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, writes and stars in a hit play that recreates their break-up, Ben fears his wife, Priscilla, will learn the truth about his messy past. Instead, the guileless, gracious Priscilla invites Jill and her companion, Tony, an older, somewhat enigmatic British journalist, to join the Oakshaws at their magnificent beach house at Cape Hatteras. Their visit unfolds at a seasonal, summer pace -- some 400 leisurely pages of intelligent and witty conversation generated by this privileged and seemingly satisfied four. The mood of ''That Summer's Trance'' is enhanced by Salamanca's abundant lyrical descriptions of water and weather, sky and shore; at one point, ''the pound and wash of the distant surf added to their conversation the ceaseless, darkling discourse of the sea.'' At another, ''the soft billows of the clouds were gradually . . . gathered into a vast, lustrous darkness, like a sable sea.'' There are undercurrents of passion, deception and self-delusion that never quite rupture the surface but subtly threaten this idyllic world. While the story is told from Ben's point of view, it is the charismatic, unconventional and somewhat unstable Jill who dominates. Salamanca maintains a nuanced tension between the two, and their partners, that keeps his ''actors'' a bit off balance, with twists of plot and perception right to the very end.</p>
