        <p>With fitted suits, pumps and pearls, this is a season of Park Avenue chic, and the handbag is its centerpiece. The new crop comes in ultraclassic shapes and sizes, from doctor bags to whisper-thin clutches, in luxe crocodile, pampered-prep tweeds and the two-tone shades of a vintage Rolls-Royce. The X factor is quiet opulence.</p>
        <p>ONE-TWO PUNCH  At last, the ban on matchy-matchy is lifted. Enter this season's most daring duos: coordinated shoes and handbags. For both day and night, these hand-to-foot twin sets are making doubly strong statements in the form of Versace's green velvet swirl-pattern pump and bag and Fendi's beige and gold leather wedge shoe with matching circle-pattern purse. ''It especially works when you put on a precious material, like an alligator mule with a matching oversize bag,'' said Jeffrey Kalinsky, owner of Jeffrey's, the downtown trend emporium. Nonetheless, he cautioned, ''a woman has to be very ironic to pull it off.'' Shoe prices? Versace, $375; Fendi, $650. Matching bags? Versace, $695; Fendi, $2,760. Finely honed sense of irony? Priceless.</p>
