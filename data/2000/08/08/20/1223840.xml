        <p>THE Worthington Hooker School in New Haven has stood for a century as the anchor of the relatively affluent and ethnically diverse East Rock neighborhood. Academically, its students outperform those of other schools in the district, and its annual festival celebrating the myriad cultures of its students -- many the children of Yale University graduate students -- is a big event. It's a neighborhood school, and parents and school officials want to keep it that way.</p>
        <p>Over the past few years, the school has expanded to include grades five through eight, currently operating as well in space leased in a former Catholic school, about a mile away. Consolidating the two groups into a K-8 school at a single location, in keeping with Superintendent Reginald Mayo's philosophy that such schools provide the best learning atmosphere for both younger and middle school-age children, is in the planning stage. New construction is at least three years away.</p>
        <p>A group of parents who met with school officials last year expressed a ''strong preference'' to expand the school on its original site. But an anonymous flier distributed to residents immediately surrounding the school earlier this summer has galvanized many in the neighborhood to oppose that plan, which, if it were to be executed, would require demolishing as many as seven houses that are as old as the school.</p>
        <p>Many neighbors see the issue as part of a larger struggle to preserve historic buildings and provide schools on a scale that fits the urban environment, without creating sprawling parking lots, closing off streets and dramatically increasing traffic.</p>
        <p>Also, the residents are determined to have a say in what goes on in their neighborhood -- something many say was denied to residents of a poorer neighborhood in the Hill section, which fought unsuccessfully this year to preserve a cluster of historic Catholic church buildings torn down to make way for another school project.</p>
        <p>New Haven is pursuing the biggest school building program in the state to replace run-down, inadequate and often depressing schools. School officials emphasize that the on-site expansion of Hooker is just one proposal and that a planning committee is looking at other options. But in an older urban neighborhood, such options are limited. Building on nearby parkland, a solution in placing several existing schools, has been ruled out.</p>
        <p>One of the first neighbors to respond to the flier was Catherine Cole, who has lived with her husband for the past 25 years in a house on Canner Street two doors from the school. Although her house is not slated for demolition under the school expansion option, she said: ''The basic issue is the historic nature of the neighborhood. It's not appropriate for a suburban-scale school. The process of determining the site for the school has not been shared with the neighbors, and that raises the specter of what happened in the Hill with St. Peter's.''</p>
        <p>The city bought the old St. Peter's buildings and then won permission in court this spring to raze them. Immediately thereafter, the city carried out the demolition, before another hearing could be held to consider listing the site in the National Register of Historic Places. That brought a threat from the Connecticut Historical Commission to revoke the city's certified local government status, under which it is eligible for state and federal funds for historic preservation.</p>
        <p>''The city has verbally agreed to abide by several recommendations to get back on track,'' said John Shannahan, the commission's director, ''but the jury is still out'' on whether it will follow through.</p>
        <p>The Hooker School sits in the middle of the Whitney Avenue Historic District, established in 1988 by the National Park Service. Anyone wishing to demolish a building in the district must wait 90 days and seek alternatives to demolition. Mr. Shannahan said that under the Connecticut Environmental Protection Act, ''any citizen has standing to get a court order to prevent 'unreasonable destruction of a National Register property.' The key word is what's 'unreasonable,' and that's up to a judge.''</p>
        <p>The school is what is called a contributing building to a National Register site, and that specification provides another layer of protection, but no guarantee of preservation.</p>
        <p>Paul Guidone, the school official responsible for the building program, said Hooker School was so far down the list of projects that no community hearings had been held or planned yet. Part of the reason for the wait, he said, is precisely the long, thorough process of community input for each of the schools built under the program. In response to Ms. Cole's request, he said she would be notified of any meetings.</p>
        <p>At a neighborhood meeting in early August, the majority favored keeping the lower grades in the original building and putting the middle school grades in another building in the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>Tom Corso, one of the Hooker parents on the school's long-range planning committee who met with school officials last year, said they were operating under two constraints. ''One was the great emotional attachment to the existing school,'' he said. ''The second was that parents and educators were unanimous in wanting grades K through 8 in one building. Otherwise, you lose the ability to share major facilities like the gym, cafeteria and library.'' Those two factors led to the preference to expand the school on site.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Corso, who lives in the neighborhood, played down the divisions over the school expansion.</p>
        <p>''It's really a debate among neighbors,'' he said. ''It's not like a foreign institution coming into the neighborhood. Everybody's concern is for the neighborhood and for the education of the children.''</p>
        <p>Anstress Farwell, a New Haven-based architectural historian, disagreed. She believes a small school in a stable environment is what most parents want for their children, and what most neighborhoods want of their schools. She quoted from a 1976 book by Elizabeth Mills Brown, ''New Haven: A Guide to Architecture and Urban Design,'' that praised Hooker School as a model. The description in the book reads: ''A statement of civil dignity, this building carries the emotional impact in the community that rightly belongs to public architecture. At the same time gentility of detail respects its residential surroundings.''</p>
        <p>Mayor John DeStefano Jr. has made the school construction program one cornerstone of his administration. The city has secured $500 million in state funding for the first 20 schools it is planning to build or thoroughly renovate. By the time school opens later this month, five will be complete. In addition, the city's two largest high schools are undergoing major renovations.</p>
        <p>After the first 20 are finished, the mayor said he would work on funding for 20 more schools, including Hooker.</p>
        <p>Mr. DeStefano, responding to the criticism around the St. Peter's demolition, said neighbors were notified of public meetings, but most did not get involved until late in the process, when the city had already invested several million dollars in site acquisition and design.</p>
        <p>The Rev. Robert Newman, pastor of Sacred Heart church in the Hill, said his parishioners and neighbors were still smarting from the disrespectful way they felt they were treated.</p>
        <p>''They redesign the neighborhood for us and tell us it's a good thing,'' he said. ''I think some of the people who have lived here for 20 or 30 or 40 years have a lot of wisdom'' that, he said, could have been drawn upon and wasn't.</p>
        <p>Mr. DeStefano said people in the East Rock neighborhood have legitimate concerns about the Hooker expansion, ''so we will probably do something earlier than we typically do, even though there is no funding yet.''</p>
        <p>As for the controversy, he said: ''For all of our school construction decisions, we've always assembled a committee of neighbors and school constituents -- parents and instructional staff -- and expect them to come up with a solution. This is an issue that the folks who go to school and live in East Rock have to decide together.''</p>
