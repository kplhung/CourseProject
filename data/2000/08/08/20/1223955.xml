      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The Suffolk County Legislature has increased annual tuition at Suffolk Community College by $100, to $2,330. The increase is reflected in the $105 million budget for the college for 2000-2001, which legislators approved earlier in August by a vote of 15 to 2, with one abstention.</p>
        <p>County Executive Robert J. Gaffney has until later this week to act on the plan; he has not publicly stated his views. Legislators altered Mr. Gaffney's original proposal so that it did not pierce a 4 percent cap on increases in annual tax subsidies for the college.</p>

        <p>The Suffolk County Legislature has increased annual tuition at Suffolk Community College by $100, to $2,330. The increase is reflected in the $105 million budget for the college for 2000-2001, which legislators approved earlier in August by a vote of 15 to 2, with one abstention.</p>
        <p>County Executive Robert J. Gaffney has until later this week to act on the plan; he has not publicly stated his views. Legislators altered Mr. Gaffney's original proposal so that it did not pierce a 4 percent cap on increases in annual tax subsidies for the college.</p>
        <p>Paul Sabatino, counsel to the legislature, said the cap was maintained by cutting $50,000 from proposed raises in management salaries, transferring $1.4 million from a college reserve fund and reducing the college's advertising budget by $318,000.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sabatino said the cut in advertising was made in part because the college was unable to account for how advertising money had been spent in the past. He said the legislators and the college trustees were also in a dispute over legislators' insistence on more complete minutes from trustee meetings.</p>
        <p>The budget includes an additional $400,000 from the reserve fund to fend off a looming deficit in the college's health insurance fund.</p>
        <p>It also includes $1.5 million for 23 new faculty members and $520,000 for 14 new employees needed to open and operate a new multipurpose complex at the college's Brentwood campus.</p>
        <p>Other campuses are in Riverhead and Selden, and about 18,685 students are enrolled at the three sites.</p>
