        <p>Sometimes it seems that no one is content to leave any tiny part of the world the way Mother Nature made it -- not when there's a profit to be turned, at any rate.</p>
        <p>Word has come that scientists in Ireland have completed a 15-year quest for a grail few people knew was holy: a strawberry plant that won't shrivel and rot in the country's cool, rainy climate.</p>
        <p>''It's a breakthrough,'' said Finnain MacNaeidhe, director of the government's Soft Fruit and Beekeeping Research Center. ''This new variety is resistant to wet weather and all the common diseases that go with it,'' he told Reuters.</p>
        <p>Field trials are planned for two more climate-challenged spots, Britain and northern France, before commercial release next summer.</p>
        <p>Runners and swimmers competing in Olympic trials, meanwhile, are trying to improve on their own skin by wearing special new body suits that enhance performance. Manufacturers like Speedo hope for a boom in sales of the suits, which can cost hundreds of dollars, after the world sees their wearers win gold medals next month in Sydney.</p>
        <p>One Australian sprinter, Mark Shirvington, was so comfortable in his Adidas suit that he ran the day's fastest 100 meters (10.29 seconds) at qualifying heats last week. Alas, he won't be able to use that suit once the games open, The Associated Press reported. Objections won't come from Olympic officials, but rather from his team's corporate sponsor, Nike.</p>
        <p>And on a remote island in Canada, researchers are crossbreeding local honeybees with queen bees from France in an effort to combat a parasitic mite that attacks the bees, on which farmers depend to pollinate fruit crops like, say, damp-resistant strawberries. If the plan fails, they can always try fitting the bees with body suits.</p>
