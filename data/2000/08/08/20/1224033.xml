        <p>EASTER ISLAND. Papua New Guinea. The Galapagos Islands. The itinerary sounds like something Charles Darwin or Margaret Mead might have dreamed up.</p>
        <p>Travelers who sign up for ''Mysteries of the Earth,'' a new private jet tour offered by TCS Expeditions, will also study Polynesian culture on the Cook Islands, hunt for herbs in the Brazilian rain forest and gaze at orangutans in the jungles of Borneo. And that is only the first half of the trip. Then comes a safari in Tanzania, an elephant trek in Nepal and bird-watching in the Seychelles.</p>
        <p>If this is the kind of whirlwind tour that excites rather than exhausts you, be sure to check out the price before you start packing: $34,950 a person, double occupancy. And even if you can afford it, you're way too late: the tour, with departures next February and March, sold out months ago.</p>
        <p>Clearly, the private jet vacation has arrived. For years no more than flashy blips on the travel industry's radar screen, deluxe jet trips have built a booming business in the last five years, according to individual tour companies, though no organization tracks their combined revenue.</p>
        <p>In an age gilded by 10 years of prosperity, there seems to be no shortage of affluent travelers who want to cover as much prime territory as they can in the most expedient -- and most comfortable -- way possible. They can choose among tours of 14 to 26 days in length and ranging from $25,000 to $62,000 in price. Offered by TCS, Travcoa, Abercrombie &amp; Kent, Intrav and a few other high-end operators, the tours use charter aircraft -- usually Boeing 737's and 757's and Lockheed L-1011's -- reconfigured to make them more commodious.</p>
        <p>TCS Expeditions uses 757's set up to seat 88 passengers instead of the usual 233. This year, the company is sending 1,500 people on 18 theme journeys, ranging from a European golfing trip that stops at six courses in four countries (including Gleneagles in Scotland and Ballybunion in Ireland) to a ''Lost Cities'' tour that goes to Laos, Mongolia and Uzbekistan, among other places.</p>
        <p>T. C. Swartz, the president of the company, said bookings doubled last year. Like other tour operators, he is surprised not only by the sudden popularity of the trips but also by their apparent habit-forming nature.</p>
        <p>''Nearly 70 percent of those who book one of our tours will book another,'' Mr. Swartz said. ''I used to think of these as once-in-a-lifetime trips. Obviously I was wrong.''</p>
        <p>Business is also up at Intrav, based in St. Louis. It was among the first to offer private jet tours when it started around-the-world Concorde trips in 1987. (In the aftermath of the Concorde crash in France last month, Intrav, like other companies that charter Concordes, is choosing another aircraft.)</p>
        <p>David Drier, a senior vice president of Intrav, said recently that its number of jet trips had nearly tripled in the last five years, to 29 this year. Among them is ''Exploring the Ancient Cultures of the Eastern Mediterranean,'' which uses a Boeing 737 that seats 44 passengers instead of the usual 120. The two-week tour, with various stops in Greece, Turkey, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan,  costs $27,500.</p>
        <p>Matthew Upchurch, chief executive of Virtuoso, an association of 244 independent luxury travel companies with combined revenue of $2.5 billion, said the tours' popularity had ''taken us all by surprise.''</p>
        <p>He attributes the recent interest to several factors. There is the strong economy, of course, something that has benefited luxury travel in general. (His association's clients spend an average of $6,000 a person for trips that last an average of seven days.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Upchurch also cites what he calls the  ''degradation of commercial aviation,'' which at this point ''can almost be described as hand-to-hand combat.'' Private jet tours -- with their promise of smooth, personalized service; palatable multicourse meals; and direct flights from one out-of-the-way location to another -- offer an attractive, if expensive, alternative to overbooked commercial flights and long delays.</p>
        <p>NED WEIGEL, 47, a real estate investor from Chattanooga, Tenn., signed up for the $28,300, 18-day ''Biarritz to the Bosporus'' trip from Intrav last spring. In one 48-hour period, his group flew from Biarritz, on the west coast of France, southwest to Bilbao, Spain, for an afternoon at the Guggenheim museum there, then returned to Biarritz for the night before heading to Madeira the next morning. On the way there, they stopped for a few hours in Granada, Spain, for tapas and a tour of the Alhambra.</p>
        <p>''If we had gone on commercial flights, it would obviously have taken many days,'' said Mr. Weigel who, at the end of the tour, overheard someone comment that his only regret was that he hadn't spent enough time on the plane. That comment, he added, ''just about says it all.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Upchurch says there is one primary reason that luxury travel in general, and jet tours in particular, have been so successful in recent years: the accrual of wealth by the  maturing post-World War II generation. While jet tour operators say most of their clients are retired or semiretired, they are noticing a steady influx of people in their 30's and 40's.</p>
        <p>''Everybody has heard so much about the impact of the baby boomers that it's beginning to sound like white noise,'' Mr. Upchurch said. But, he added, ''the travel industry hasn't seen the full brunt of them.''</p>
        <p>''They are not just a group of people with a lot of money,'' he said. ''They are the best-educated, best-connected, best-traveled and most demanding group of consumers in the history of mankind.''</p>
        <p>Their parents, the mainstay of deluxe travel, viewed travel as a luxury, not a right, Mr. Upchurch said. But those of the post-World War II generation see it the other way around, and their guilt-free spending seems to be affecting their elders.</p>
        <p>''For many years, there was a reluctance to spend such money on expensive travel options, even if you had the means,'' said Mr. Drier of Intrav. ''Now the attitude is, 'Why not? We deserve this!' ''</p>
        <p>A new demand for ''unique'' experiences goes hand in hand with this new attitude. ''It's not enough to say you've gone to India or Australia,'' Mr. Drier said. ''It's what you've done when you're there that counts.''</p>
        <p>On the ''Nepal and the Desert Kingdoms of Rajasthan'' tour, offered by Intrav, guests spend the night in the royal tents of the Maharaja of Jodhpur. On a jet tour around South America, Abercrombie &amp; Kent arranges an after-dinner re-enactment of the Rio carnival. And on a recent around-the-world tour, Travcoa arranged for two hairdressers from Nairobi, Kenya, to fly to Nice, France, with its group of dusty, disheveled clients, so everyone could arrive in appropriate form for an evening in Monte Carlo.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weigel, who has taken four jet vacations with Intrav, has his own favorite experience: rising at dawn for a hot-air balloon trip to the Masai Mara Reserve in Kenya, where a table had been set up in the wilderness for a white-linen Champagne breakfast.</p>
        <p>FOR many people who take these tours, the extravagances -- breakfast on the plains of Africa, lunch on the lawns of the Umaid Bhawan Palace in Jodhpur, India, Christmas dinner at the Grand Hotel Victoria-Jungfrau in Interlaken -- are outshone by the routine luxuries: first-class accommodations everywhere possible; guides who include academic experts and former ambassadors; airline crews trained at prestigious hotel schools.</p>
        <p>But there may be a few drawbacks. Some travelers point out routine annoyances, like the respiratory illnesses that bounce back and forth among aircraft-bound tour members, and the decidedly feverish pace of many trips. David Dibner, a retired business executive, said TCS Expeditions' ''Lost Cities'' tour left him and his wife, Frances,  nearly exhausted after ''three weeks of two-night stands'' in Jordan, Cambodia and other exotic places. Mr. Dibner said he recognized the value of visiting ''extraordinary locations that the average tourist would not know how to get to,'' although, he said, his first jet tour would probably be his last.</p>
        <p>Nothing, however, is likely to keep Mr. Weigel from taking another one. He even says the tours are a good deal. ''People constrained for vacation time get the biggest bang for their buck,'' he said. ''So for me, it's obviously a value worth repeating.''</p>
