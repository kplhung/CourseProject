        <p>In the ninth running of the Ladies versus Veterans Match, held at the Bayrischer Hof in Munich in early July, the Ladies triumphed, 27-23. The Veterans, roughly over age 55, still hold a 273-265 lead in the series. The overall high scorer this time was Viktor Korchnoi, with 7 1/2-2 1/2.</p>
        <p>The second and third high scorers were Nana Joseliani of Georgia and Jun Xie of China, each of whom tallied 6 1/2-3 1/2. Alisa Galliamova of Russia was fourth highest at 6-4.</p>
        <p>The oldest player on the Veterans team was a former world champion, Vassily Smyslov, 79, who notched 5-5.</p>
        <p>Korchnoi, at 69, has resisted the deterioration of age better than anyone who ever played the game. That can be seen in his final round game against Jun Xie, in which his sharp play overcame a tough opponent.</p>
        <p>Ten years ago, the aggressive 7 f4 came up, but quickly faded from popularity. Now it is being tried again, particularly in China.</p>
        <p>After 10 . . . Ne4, a Lei Wang-Jianchuan Ye game at Shanghai 2000 proceeded with 11 Ne4 de 12 Ng5 f6! 13 ef ef 14 Ne4 Ne6 15 d5 cd 16 cd Nf4 17 O-O g5 18 Bc4 Qc7 19 Nd2 Kh8 20 Bf2 b6 21 Rc1 Bb7 22 Bg3 Rad8 23 Bf4 gf 24 Nf3 Qc5 25 Qd4 Bd5 26 Bd5 Qd5, giving Black the upper hand.</p>
        <p>But Korchnoi revived the white attack with 12 g3!?, even though it seemed to put his queen bishop into difficulty.</p>
        <p>After 18 hg, Korchnoi has a weak pawn at g3, but Xie has a more accessible weak pawn at d5.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the black king bishop is largely cut out of the play, and the b1-h7 diagonal is open against the black king. In the long run that turns out to be the decisive factor.</p>
        <p>Even Xie's getting rid of the white king bishop with 20 . . . Bf5 21 Bf5 Rf5 did not alter the situation.</p>
        <p>If 24 . . . Rf4,then 25 Qh7 Kf8 26 Rh4 Rg4 (or 26 . . . Ne6 27 Rf1 Ke8 28 Qg6 Kd8 29 Ng5! Rf1 30 Ne6 Kc8 31 Kf1 and Korchnoi wins) 27 Kh2! Rh4 28 Nh4 Qg4 29 Ng6 Ke8 30 Qg7 Qh5 31 Kg3 Qg5 32 Kf2 Qf5 33 Ke3 Qg5 34 Kd3 Qf2 35 Kd2 Qg5 36 Kc2 Qf5 37 Kb3 Qe6 38 Rf1. There is no defense against 38 Rf8 Kd7 39 Ra8 Na8 40 Nf8.</p>
        <p>Korchnoi had already won a pawn with 25 Qh7 but, more important, he had fatally exposed the black king's defenses. The game was really over at this point.</p>
        <p>After 28 Qg5, it was useless to play 28 . . . e6, because 29 Rh7 Qe7 30 Qg6 Qb4 31 Rf1! Qb2 32 Kh3 Qc3 33 Kh4 Qc7 34 Qg7 Ke8 35 Rf7 wins outright.</p>
        <p>But after 28 Rc8 29 Rh7! Xie gave up. If 29 . . . Qe6 30 Rf1 Rf1 31 Qg7 Ke8 32 Kf1, she would have been a piece down.</p>
