      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>With fitted suits, pumps and pearls, this is a season of Park Avenue chic, and the handbag is its centerpiece. The new crop comes in ultraclassic shapes and sizes, from doctor bags to whisper-thin clutches, in luxe crocodile, pampered-prep tweeds and the two-tone shades of a vintage Rolls-Royce. The X factor is quiet opulence.</p>
        <p>THE MATCHMAKER  With 26 marriages to her credit and a collection of 50 used handbags in her closet, Samantha Daniels, founder of a dating service called SamanthasTable  .com, sees potential where others might miss it. When she began collecting six years ago, bags by Judith Leiber and Roberta di Camerino became her mainstay, though hardly desirable at the time. They were ''dressy but different,'' said Ms. Daniels, here wearing a white leather halter ($530) and blue leather skirt ($960) by Christina Perrin. Now that luxury and glamour have returned in a big way, those bag lines are making a comeback, particularly the Camerino Bagonghi model, velvet patterned bags shaped like small doctor's satchels (new fabric versions are at Barneys for $395 to $1,200). Likewise, Ms. Leiber's signature jeweled, hard-cased evening clutches ($895 to $5,100), once considered over the top, are sparkling again.</p>
