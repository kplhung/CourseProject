        <p>IN her 1965 review of ''The Sound of Music'' for The New York Herald Tribune, Judith Crist wrote, ''The movie is for the 5-to-7 set and their mommies who think their kids aren't up to the stinging sophistication and biting wit of 'Mary Poppins.' ''</p>
        <p>The rest is history.</p>
        <p>Today, as the highest grossing film musical of all time approaches its 35th anniversary, it is about to begin yet another life -- this time as official, rather than accidental, kitsch. .</p>
        <p>On Sept. 6, ''Sing-a-Long Sound of Music,'' the audience participation version of the movie that has been playing to delirious crowds at the Prince Charles Cinema in London, will make its debut in New York at the Ziegfeld Theater.</p>
        <p>The basic premise is simple: During such deathless Rodgers and Hammerstein standards as ''Sixteen Going On Seventeen,'' ''So Long, Farewell'' and ''Climb Ev'ry Mountain,'' moviegoers sing along to the lyrics, which appear on the screen as subtitles.</p>
        <p>Singing along, however, is just one of the evening's many opportunities for self-expression. In London, when Julie Andrews's fellow nuns ask, ''How do you solve a problem like Maria?'' the crowd holds up postcards printed with question marks. When Captain von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) first kisses Maria, they let loose a hail of party poppers.</p>
        <p>Attendees wear nuns' habits and lederhosen; others dress as Nazis, the Alps (covered in shaving cream) and as representations of song lyrics -- like wild geese, with cutouts of the moon mounted on their wings, as described in ''My Favorite Things.''</p>
        <p>Bert Fink, a spokesman for the Rodgers and Hammerstein Organization, which controls the copyright on the composers' music and lyrics, thinks such strenuous glee is, for the English, the adult equivalent of the breathless outbursts at traditional English Punch and Judy shows. Example: when Julie Andrews cannot find material to make play clothes for the von Trapp tykes, the audience yells, ''The curtains, Maria!''</p>
        <p>In July, home-grown performances were mounted in Boston and Austin, Tex. Charmian Carr, who portrayed the eldest von Trapp daughter, Liesl, was the guest of honor in Austin. Ms. Carr, the author of ''Forever Liesl: A Memoir of the Sound of Music'' (Viking, 2000), recalled that during one scene in which Mr. Plummer tenderly touched Ms. Andrews's nose, a chant of ''Get the booger, captain!'' arose.</p>
        <p>''It was hysterical,'' she said. ''There were 1,300 people and they were sitting in the aisles. It was sacrilegious, but great fun. It could just be that there are so many people who really do love the movie.''</p>
        <p>Others are more cynical. Ms. Crist, for example.</p>
        <p>''I think it's so popular because the world has come to realize what a really godawful thing the film is,'' she said. ''In 35 years it's become even sappier. There's a point where it's so bad that it becomes funny.''</p>
        <p>As with ''Mommie Dearest'' and ''Valley of the Dolls,'' this camp aspect of ''Sing-a-Long Sound of Music'' has made it a hit with gay viewers. The production began as an entry in the London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival; the Austin Gay and Lesbian International Film Festival co-produced the Texas event to benefit Project Transitions, a nonprofit group that provides hospice care and housing for AIDS victims.</p>
        <p>''We just thought it would be fun,'' said Charlotte Hale, the executive director of Project Transitions.  ''Certainly the gay community liked it, but a lot of mainstream people were there.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, the show is being dizzily promoted as all-family entertainment. ''Wave your edelweiss!'' reads a press release. ''Cheer the von Trapp kids! Bark at Rolf (the telegram boy)! Boo the Nazis! Hiss the baroness!''</p>
        <p>Camp aside, the movie also seems to have a powerful emotional effect on a lot of apparently normal people. Even ushers at the singalongs have been seen to choke up during the finale.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the countless renderings of ''Do-Re-Mi'' and ''My Favorite Things'' in grade school and in Muzak-filled elevators have left permanent musical saccharine deposits in the collective consciousness. Perhaps, like the Kevin Bacon Game, ''Sing-a-Long Sound of Music'' was a form of cinemania just waiting to happen.</p>
        <p>''Kenneth Tynan said that movies are the most dominant repository of memory we have,'' said the film critic Andrew Sarris. ''I suppose this is just a manifestation of that. Everyone remembers 'The Sound of Music.' You can blast it but you can't obliterate it, I guess.''</p>
