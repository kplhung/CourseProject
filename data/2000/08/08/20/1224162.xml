        <p>An internal Ford Motor Company document obtained by lawyers suing the automaker and Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. shows that the company considered using tires with higher pressure than the Firestone tires now subject to a recall, but decided against them because they increased the risk that Explorer sport utility vehicles using them would tip over.</p>
        <p>Bridgestone is recalling 6.5 million tires mounted mainly on Explorers because they are prone to losing their treads at high speeds. Federal regulators say that they have received more than 750 complaints about the tires involving at least 62 deaths. Almost all of the deaths occurred in sport utility vehicles that rolled over, mostly Explorers.</p>

        <p>An internal Ford Motor Company document obtained by lawyers suing the automaker and Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. shows that the company considered using tires with higher pressure than the Firestone tires now subject to a recall, but decided against them because they increased the risk that Explorer sport utility vehicles using them would tip over.</p>
        <p>Bridgestone is recalling 6.5 million tires mounted mainly on Explorers because they are prone to losing their treads at high speeds. Federal regulators say that they have received more than 750 complaints about the tires involving at least 62 deaths. Almost all of the deaths occurred in sport utility vehicles that rolled over, mostly Explorers.</p>
        <p>Since the recall began, Bridgestone has urged consumers to fill 15-inch tires on Explorers to 30 pounds per square inch. Ford had recommended since the Explorer went on sale that the 15-inch tires be filled to 26 pounds per square inch, but has said over the last week that a range of 26 to 30 pounds was acceptable.</p>
        <p>The difference has caught the attention of lawyers who sue tiremakers because tires are more likely to fail if they are used at lower pressure. The lower the pressure, the softer the tire, which means that  more of its sidewall is in contact with the road. This increases the heat of the tire, and can cause the tread to peel off, particularly if the tire is poorly made.</p>
        <p>C. Tab Turner, a lawyer in Little Rock, Ark., who is suing Ford and Bridgetone/Firestone on behalf of people injured in tire-related crashes, said in an interview on Monday that the document showed that the Explorer was an inherently flawed vehicle that was prone to tipping over.</p>
        <p>''The tire pressure is directly related to the handling and stability issue,'' Mr. Turner said.</p>
        <p>Ford officials strongly defend the stability of the Explorer. Even with the deaths attributed to the tires, the occupants of Explorers have a 22 percent lower death rate in rollover crashes than occupants of other mid-size sport utility vehicles, said Ernie Grush, Ford's manager of safety data analysis. The overall death rate for Explorer occupants in all types of crashes is 24 percent lower than the overall rate for other mid-size sport utilities, and is comparable to death rates for cars because Explorer occupants fare well in collisions with other vehicles, Mr. Grush said.</p>
        <p>Ford officials have said that they selected the tire pressure for the Explorer so as to give it a smooth ride, and have insisted that a tire pressure of 26 pounds per square inch provided an ample safety margin against slow leaks that a consumer might not notice. Tire damage, and ultimately tire failures, are rare unless a tire is operated at less than 20 pounds per square inch, and become a significant possibility only when pressure is in the low or midteens, said Tom Baughman, Ford's engineering director for North American trucks.</p>
        <p>While hard tires are less likely to fail, they allow a motorist to turn more sharply than soft tires do, even at high speeds. Automakers try to limit how sharply a vehicle can turn, particularly if it has a high center of gravity as most sport utility vehicles do, so as to limit the risk that it will roll over. If a driver turns sharply  any vehicle while traveling very fast, the vehicle may roll, but the risk is increased for taller vehicles.</p>
        <p>The internal Ford document says that the company decided against the use of higher-pressure tires so as to limit so-called cornering forces, a measure of how hard the front end of the vehicle can be turned. Ford officials have said that they did not choose a low tire pressure because of rollover concerns. Brook Lindbert, the tire and wheel engineering director at General Motors, said that automakers tried to limit cornering forces mainly through suspension designs, not tire pressure.</p>
