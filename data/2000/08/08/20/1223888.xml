        <p>Good Morning, America film critic Joel Siegel letter scores flippant tone of Franz Lidz's August 6 article on Jewish Museum's screening of television dramas featuring Jewish characters in American West (S)</p>

        <p>To The Editor:</p>
        <p>What is valuable about programs like the Jewish Museum's screening of four television dramas that feature Jewish characters in the American West is that through popular culture we are given the gift to see ourselves as others see us. And, increasingly, the way others see us is the way we ourselves see our own history. That is what upset me about the flippant tone of your article [''What's a Talmudist Doing in a Place Like This?'' by Franz Lidz, Aug. 6]. We deserve better.</p>
        <p>''Gunfights at the Oy Vey Corral'' and ''Billy the Kibbitzer'' are callous stereotypes without any historical validity. The vaudeville, ''ghetto,'' Yiddish-speaking Jew is a creation of the early 20th century. Jews in the American West, and there were some, were Spanish, German or Western European in background. With few exceptions they did not speak Yiddish.</p>

        <p>''Gunfights at the Oy Vey Corral'' and ''Billy the Kibbitzer'' are callous stereotypes without any historical validity. The vaudeville, ''ghetto,'' Yiddish-speaking Jew is a creation of the early 20th century. Jews in the American West, and there were some, were Spanish, German or Western European in background. With few exceptions they did not speak Yiddish.</p>
        <p>They included a Spanish Jew who founded at least one West Texas county, the mayors of many Western towns (not an uncommon choice; Jews knew how to read), and, talk about your Oy Vey Corral, Wyatt Earp's wife, Sadie Marcus, whom he met in a Tombstone dance hall. It's not known whether Earp converted, but he is buried in a Jewish cemetery.  JOEL SIEGEL  Manhattan</p>
