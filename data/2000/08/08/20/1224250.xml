        <p>SHERMAN-Victor. On August 18, 2000. Beloved husband of Glenda; loving father of Beth and Nancy; father in-law of Andy and Michael. Cherished grandfather of Jessie and Sam. Friends may call Sunday 7-9pm, Frank E. Campbell The Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81 St. Funeral service Monday, August 21, 11:30 at Frank E. Campbell. Interment Old Montefiore Cemetery. In lieu of flowers, donations to NYC Chapter, Leukemia Society, 475 Park Ave. South, 21st floor, New York, NY 10016, would be appreciated.</p>
        <p>SHERMAN-Victor. It is with deep sadness that the firm of Ochs &amp; Goldberg, LLP mourns the loss of a friend and client. Victor was a legend in his industry and a mentor to all who knew him. Regardless of his age, Victor was always wise beyond his years. His loyalty, strength and courage were unmatched; particularly over the past two years as he waged the most courageous fight of his life. On a personal note, I already miss our early morning daily conversations and Victor's keen insight into all matters which impacted upon his life, family and his passion, ''Solco Plumbing''. I am eternally grateful for his loyalty, trust, and unbound confidence in me. You are truly a ''one of a kind'' individual and I will miss you. Mitchell Goldberg</p>
        <p>SHERMAN-Victor. All of the ''Solco family'', including employees and associates, extend our sincerest and profound sympathy to the Sherman family on the loss of our Founder and CEO, Victor Sherman. The wisdom and principles that he has imbued in the company will continue. He was like a father to all of us. Our prayers and thoughts are with him and his family. He will be missed deeply. Solco Plumbing Supply, Inc.</p>
        <p>SHERMAN-Victor. We extend our deepest sympathy and condolences to Glenda Sherman, Beth, Nancy and their families. Victor was our dear friend who left us with many values that will remain in our lives forever. He will be sorely missed. We grieve for him and with you. Rutta and Company, LLP</p>
        <p>SHERMAN-Victor. Temple Shaaray Tefila records his death with profound sorrow. We extend heartfelt condolences to his wife Glenda, his children and his entire family. Rabbi Harvey M. Tattelbaum Ellen R. Saxl, Co-President Michael H. Laufer, Co-President</p>
