        <p>Paul O'Neill leaned on the railing in front of the Yankees' dugout in the first moments after their extra-inning loss to Anaheim on Friday night at Yankee Stadium, glaring at the home plate umpire, Gary Cederstrom, as Cederstrom passed on his way to the dressing room.</p>
        <p>''I hope you can sleep tonight,'' O'Neill said he told Cederstrom, feeling as if the integrity of the game had been compromised.</p>
        <p>''Don't threaten me,'' Cederstrom retorted, according to O'Neill, who was furious.</p>
        <p>O'Neill often debates with umpires after balls and strikes, but his rage with Cederstrom reached a higher level: he believes Cederstrom called strikes on him in retaliation for complaints O'Neill made in the fourth inning. ''The most intentional thing I've ever seen in my life,'' O'Neill said. ''In 14 years.''</p>
        <p>In the fourth, O'Neill griped to Cederstrom about a strike call. The two debated; at one point, O'Neill stepped away from home plate. Anaheim's Ramon Ortiz threw a pitch that appeared to be well outside of the strike zone, and Cederstrom called O'Neill out on strikes.</p>
        <p>O'Neill was incensed, turned and argued with Cederstrom, until both Bernie Williams and Manager Joe Torre pushed him away. For the remainder of the game, the tension built between O'Neill and the umpire. Cederstrom declined to comment; Torre did not.</p>
        <p>''It's disturbing, it really is,'' he said. ''I didn't hear any of the conversation, and I really didn't get into it with Paul. But it certainly looked like Gary was bothered by something and sort of pranced around a little bit. It's disturbing to me, the strike zone, and you hope there's nothing more than that. There's a lot of dignity in this game, and that's the way it should be. You have the best people in the world doing their job, and you hope everybody does their job.</p>
        <p>''Cederstrom didn't throw him out, and he restrained himself in that regard. He kept him in the game, and that was the important thing.''</p>
        <p>Players have always theorized that umpires will retaliate, but it is extremely rare when a player suggests this publicly. The Yankees have issued informal complaints against umpires in the past. Brian Cashman, their general manager, said he had no plans to ''pursue anything against Gary Cederstrom.''</p>
        <p>Rivera Shrugs Off a Bad Game</p>
        <p>When Mo Vaughn's three-run homer disappeared into the right-field stands Friday night, Mariano Rivera had five blown saves for this season -- one more than during the 1999 season, when he converted 45 of 49 chances. Rivera, unavailable for questions after Friday's game, spoke amiably with reporters yesterday, accepting blame for the loss. ''That was ridiculous,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He was asked why he thinks he isn't as dominant as he was last year, and why he seems to have trouble keeping his fastball down on some nights, and whether he should have taken a couple of warm-up pitches Friday, just before Vaughn's home run; Vaughn fouled Rivera's first pitch off the right big toe of catcher Jorge Posada, who slumped to the ground for a couple of minutes before resuming. Rivera waited on the mound throughout the delay, without throwing, and Vaughn slugged his next pitch over the wall.</p>
        <p>Rivera responded to all of these questions in a similar fashion. ''Today is a new day,'' he kept saying with a smile, effectively declining to contribute to the analysis. ''It's a shiny day, a sunny day.''</p>
        <p>Rivera allowed just 43 hits and 18 walks in 69 innings last year, striking out 52. This year, he has surrendered 45 hits and 17 walks in 54 1/3 innings, with 40 strikeouts, and has 26 saves in 31 chances.</p>
        <p>Twinge Puts Williams on Bench</p>
        <p>Bernie Williams, who played in the Yankees' first 118 games this season, was scratched from the lineup yesterday after feeling a twinge in his side during batting practice. The Yankees announced that the injury was not serious and that he was not expected to miss any more time; it may be that the twinge provided a convenient reason for Joe Torre to give Williams -- in a bit of a slump -- the day off.</p>
        <p>''I sense he's a little tired, I do,'' Torre said before making the lineup change. ''If he continues to struggle, I'll just send Bellinger out there.''</p>
        <p>Since the demotion of outfielder Ryan Thompson, Torre has said he will use Clay Bellinger, a utilityman, to back up Williams.</p>
