        <p>Jacquelyn Laney Williams and Henry Irvin Florsheim are to be married today by Rabbi Alan Block at their home in Brooklyn. The Rev. Lewis Marshall, an Episcopal priest, is to participate in the ceremony.</p>
        <p>The bride, 56, will keep her name. She is a kindergarten teacher and the diversity coordinator at the Packer Collegiate Institute in Brooklyn. She graduated from Stanford University and received a master's in education from the Bank Street College of Education. Ms. Williams is the daughter of the late Eleanor Smith and Jack Laney, who lived in Phoenix.</p>
        <p>The bridegroom, 52, is an assistant manager in the debt derivatives department at Citigroup, the financial services corporation in Manhattan. He is working on a bachelor's degree in business from the State University's Empire State College. The bridegroom, whose previous marriage ended in divorce, is the son of the late Betty and Herman Florsheim, who lived in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The couple met through Drip Cafe, a singles coffee bar on the Upper West Side.</p>
        <p>One weekend in April last year, Ms. Williams, a widow, visited the crowded cafe with a friend. She thumbed through matchmaking looseleaf binders that the cafe keeps, with profiles of men and women. The first ones she looked at were of men much younger than she. When she asked for a binder with men over 40, one of the waitresses suggested she return during the week, when the cafe would be less crowded.</p>
        <p>When Ms. Williams came back, she found an entry by Mr. Florsheim and liked it. He had written, ''My favorite thing to do is go anywhere with the one I love.''</p>
        <p>The staff played matchmaker, calling Mr. Florsheim for Ms. Williams and directing him to the profile of herself that she had left.</p>
        <p>The couple met at the cafe the next evening. He liked her candor and her enthusiasm for life and for working with children, he said. She liked the fact that he had coached Little League for 15 years, a sign that he, too, enjoyed children. She also found him attractive and attentive.</p>
        <p>''I laid out what I was about the first night,'' she said. ''At this point in my life, I just want to be myself.''</p>
