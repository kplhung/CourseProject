        <p>IT'S time for more tales of absurdity from the Garden State. That's right: it's time for another look at some Least Important Moments in 20th-Century New Jersey History.</p>
        <p>Faithful readers, if any, will recall that an e-mail discussion group that I'm involved in had been trading nominations for the event or development that most influenced New Jersey in the century just winding down. That prompted me to go searching for the opposite: things from the last 100 years that were of virtually no consequence at all.</p>
        <p>That first compilation ended up being surprisingly insightful, if I do say so myself -- it included some pioneering speed bumps in Chatham; a state trooper who was fired for shooting a man's hat off his head on a dare; and a naturalist who predicted, 35 years ago, that the state would be devoid of wildlife by now. It turns out there are plenty of other events where those came from. These, for instance, again presented in chronological order for lack of a better one:</p>
        <p>But That Was a Lot of Money Back Then -- Officials gathered at the Fidelity Trust Company of Newark on April 22, 1910, to open a strongbox belonging to George Forman, a Newark city auditor. Forman had disappeared a few days earlier, and the officials were hoping the strongbox might contain several thousand dollars that couldn't be accounted for. Inside, they found 2 cents.</p>
        <p>Some Factoids Speak for Themselves -- On May 28, 1919, at the 10th annual meeting of something called the New Jersey Association Opposed to Suffrage for Women, Mrs. Frances Preston of Princeton was elected first vice president of the group. She was the widow of President Grover Cleveland.</p>
        <p>Why Finding Volunteer Firefighters Is So Difficult -- On July 2, 1925, Lt. Raymond L. Buck of Hammonton and five other members of that community's volunteer fire department were attending a firefighters convention in Millville. In fact, they won first honors in the parade. Meanwhile, back home in Hammonton, a fire was destroying the chicken house on Buck's farm, costing him his entire flock. When he got back to town Buck was fined, under fire department rules, for failure to be present at a fire.</p>
        <p>When Politics Was Fun, Part I -- Election officials in Newark were conducting a recount on Nov. 24, 1936, when, according to a newspaper account, they found a ballot with  a neat X marked opposite the name of every candidate in every party. Then, for good measure, the voter also put an X next to the signature of the county clerk.</p>
        <p>Sometimes All It Takes Is One Brave Man -- On June 5, 1965, in Little Falls, Police Chief Daniel Berghorn, peeved about a recent car crash, defied the state by sticking four stop signs at the intersection of Ridge Road and Francisco Avenue, one at each corner. At the time, four-way stops were not permitted under state highway regulations. ''The state preaches safety,'' the chief said, ''so I decided to go ahead.'' He admitted, though, that any motorist caught running the stop signs could not be prosecuted.</p>
        <p>The Experiment That Probably Didn't Need to Be Conducted -- On Feb. 17, 1966, the New Jersey Expressway Authority announced it was ending an honor system on the recently completed Atlantic City Expressway whereby drivers without exact change could take a courtesy envelope and mail in their tolls. Only 17 percent of those taking envelopes were sending them in, a loss of $1,000 a month, officials said.</p>
        <p>When Politics Was Fun, Part II -- On Nov. 8, 1966, Hackettstown's Republican mayor, Robert Kitchen, was re-elected by 111 votes in a surprisingly tight race -- surprising because his opponent, Howard Samuel, had died a month earlier. Even though Samuel, too, was a Republican, Democrats were pushing his candidacy, apparently thinking that if he won posthumously they could name a Democratic replacement for him.</p>
        <p>At Least He Didn't Pick Bets, Wets or Regrets -- On July 15, 1968, Arthur Brown announced that he was moving his American Basketball Association team, the New Jersey Americans, out of Teaneck and over to Long Island. He took the opportunity to change the team's name as well. Supposedly a reporter made a facetious suggestion that he pick a name that rhymed with two other New York teams, the Mets and the Jets, and the New York Nets were born. The name, of course, stuck when the team was moved back to New Jersey in 1977.</p>
        <p>That Familiar Ring -- On Dec. 20, 1970, a federal lawsuit was filed against the State Police accusing troopers of singling out ''long-haired persons'' when pulling motorists over on the New Jersey Turnpike.</p>
