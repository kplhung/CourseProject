        <p>WHEN automakers brought out their 2000 models last fall, executives were jubilant. Their companies were enjoying record sales, and the Federal Reserve's two interest rate increases seemed to be having little effect; the manufacturers simply offset them by subsidizing their discounted auto loans more heavily.</p>
        <p>Auto sales remain strong, but the optimism has faded. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has pushed up short-term interest rates four more times since last autumn. Trying to avoid raising interest rates for their discounted loans, automakers stepped up the subsidies even further, but the mounting costs crimped profit margins. They wound up having to raise rates anyway on their lowest-rate loans this summer.</p>
        <p>''Greenspan was trying to slow it down and we didn't believe it -- we thought it was just a bump; we'll eat it,'' said Tom McAlear, the chief operating officer of DaimlerChrysler Financial Services, the North American lending unit of the German automaker. ''Finally, we said, 'Alan, you're serious, we believe you.' ''</p>
        <p>Economists are fond of repeating the adage that monetary policy affects the real economy with long and variable lags. The lag has seemed longer than usual for the current round of rate increases. The continued strength of the stock market has played a role, but so has the remarkable stamina of auto sales even as rates have risen.</p>
        <p>When the Fed raised interest rates in 1994 in leaps of half a point and even three-quarters of a point at a time, the automakers' finance subsidiaries reacted with alarm, swiftly passing on matching rate increases to their loan customers. The automakers, particularly General Motors, were still reeling from the 1991 recession and in no mood then for a war of discounts.</p>
        <p>But the current round of Fed increases crept up on an industry that has been very profitable since the mid-1990's. All but one of the increases came in just a quarter-point increment, and most have been hailed on Wall Street as the last. One result has been a gradual ratcheting up of incentive costs, escalating into a discounting war that no automaker is willing to lose, even as everyone in the industry hopes that the Fed will not act again.</p>
        <p>''There's a little heat on -- we're hoping for no more increases,'' said G. Richard Wagoner Jr., G.M.'s chief executive.</p>
        <p>While Internet and computer companies now rule Wall Street, the auto industry remains a cornerstone of the real economy. Autos still account for about 4 percent of the nation's economy, a percentage that has barely budged in decades. General Motors, Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler are each eight times the size of Microsoft in sales, and economic output is measured by final sales of goods and services, not by stock prices. Yet G.M.'s market value is now just a tenth of Microsoft's, one reason that Carl Icahn bought a big stake in G.M. last week.</p>
        <p>Consumer interest rates are the crucial economic factor in auto sales. Four-fifths of all vehicle buyers finance their cars, minivans, pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles through loans or leases. They closely study monthly payments, which depend on interest rates. By contrast, the price of filling up the tank, high this summer, has rarely had much impact on auto sales over the years, except when the overall economy was weak.</p>
        <p>Banks raised their auto loan rates repeatedly over the last year in response to Fed actions. The average bank rate for four-year auto loans is now just over 10 percent, compared with 8.3 percent in the spring of last year, said David L. Littmann, the senior economist at Comerica Bank in Detroit.</p>
        <p>After the recent increases, automakers' finance subsidiaries are now charging an average of about 7 percent. Their average for the second quarter, 6.48 percent, was actually a few hundredths of a point lower than a year earlier. Automakers tried to raise their finance subsidiaries' rates last winter, but they retreated rather than lose market share to rivals.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, the manufacturers have been financing a growing number of their customers' purchases, and the subsidies to keep rates so low have pushed automakers' marketing costs to as much as $2,300 a vehicle. Sales continue to roll along at a very strong pace of 17.5 million cars and light trucks a year, a little slower than last winter on a seasonally adjusted basis but still ahead of last year.</p>
        <p>The question is how much longer it will be before the auto industry gives in and raises or restricts its subsidized rates, at the risk of losing sales. James P. Holden, the chief executive of the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler, says this has begun to happen, but slowly. ''We have stopped matching every Fed increase and holding flat payments,'' he said. ''Payments have gone up.''</p>
