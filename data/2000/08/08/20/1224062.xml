        <p>At the United Nations, where one person's joke can strike 100 other people from 100 other cultures as incomprehensible, if not offensive, diplomats, ever cautious and circumspect, take refuge in the universal language of the political cartoon.</p>
        <p>''Diplomats relish the irony of so many political situations,'' said Kamalesh Sharma, India's ambassador to the United Nations. ''In most diplomatic missions in New York, you'll find that a particularly appealing cartoon is pinned up so that the delectation can continue for days and days.''</p>
        <p>Over the next few weeks, a panel of diplomats -- Ambassador Sharma among them -- and American celebrities will choose the winner of a $10,000 prize for the best political cartoon on a United Nations theme.</p>
        <p>In recent months hundreds of entries have poured in from around the world, from Iran to Ethiopia to Cuba, said Ranan Lurie, the cartoonist and caricaturist who put up the prize money for the competition, which is sponsored by the United Nations Correspondents' Association. Shashi Tharoor, Secretary General Kofi Annan's communications director, piloted the project through the organization, telling skeptical United Nations bureaucrats that it was a new way to ''propagate the message of the U.N.''</p>
        <p>The jury assembled by Mr. Lurie could lend itself to a cartoon. It is headed by Elie Wiesel and will include seven ambassadors, from North America, Europe, Africa and Asia; an actor, Jeff Bridges; an athlete, David Cone; an author, Norman Mailer; Floyd Abrams, the First Amendment lawyer; James Hoge, editor of Foreign Affairs, and William J. Rowe, publisher of Times-Mirror Newspapers in Connecticut.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lurie, who is best known as a caricaturist, says good political cartoonists need five things: the training to practice ''pure good journalism,'' professional artistic standards, the ability to capture personality through caricature, humor and the gift of condensing all that into a quick message.</p>
        <p>''I think the good political cartoon is really the smart bomb of the media,'' said Mr. Lurie, who publishes a magazine, Cartoon News International, for young people. ''The advantage of the political cartoon versus the written article is that it will deliver in seven seconds what an article will not deliver in 17 minutes. Once you've invested your very important and precious seven seconds you become wiser. You know what is happening in Chechnya. You know what is happening in East Timor. Besides, a cartoon is good for you, like ice cream with vitamins. Better than broccoli.''</p>
        <p>Ambassador Sharma of India said his all-time favorite cartoon dealt with the botched attempt to rescue American hostages in Iran during the Carter administration. In the cartoon, tragedy was touched by the absurd.</p>
        <p>''I remember a helicopter whirring away and this G.I. is throwing on the ground dozens and dozens of rabbits,'' Mr. Sharma said of the drawing. ''They're all sitting there on the ground cross-eyed, wondering what they're doing. And a G.I. on the ground is yelling through the noise of the rotor: 'I said, a rapid deployment force!' ''</p>
        <p>''Everyone knows what a complex business any item of global politics is, so a cartoon humanizes it,'' Mr. Sharma said. ''After all the jargon you read in the paper and positions taken and all the heat which is generated, in the end it says: Look, human beings are fractious, but if human beings can laugh, there's hope.''</p>
