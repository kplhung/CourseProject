        <p>POLICE officers searching for cocaine engaged in unconstitutional and illegal activity during an early-morning raid of a Peekskill home 15 months ago, the residents of the home are claiming in a lawsuit filed in federal court here.</p>
        <p>The residents' lawyer, John J. Grimes of Chappaqua, said Sheila James and her family were mistreated by a dozen officers who stormed their John Street home on May 8, 1999, with guns drawn, handcuffed them, ransacked the apartment and left without formally charging anyone.</p>
        <p>But William J. Florence Jr., the outside counsel for the city, called Mr. Grimes's 11-page complaint ''a hunk of junk'' and said many of its allegations are false. He said that the officers followed standard police procedure during the search and that no damage was done and no one was injured.</p>
        <p>''So, how inappropriate is the police behavior?'' Mr. Florence said. ''It doesn't sound inappropriate to me.''</p>
        <p>However Mr. Grimes, a former detective with the New York City Police Department, said the story his clients tell is unlike anything he has ever heard. He said it raises serious questions about the conduct, training and supervision of the Peekskill officers. His suit, lodged on Aug. 3 against the city, the police department, Police Chief Eugene Tumolo, a detective and 11 other officers, seeks compensatory and punitive damages for each of the four family members who were in the home at the time of the raid.</p>
        <p>''I just think they overstepped their bounds,'' Mr. Grimes said. ''This is way beyond what police officers are trained to do.''</p>
        <p>When questioned about the police tactics, Lt. Paul Astrologo, the executive officer of the 61-member department, declined to comment because of the lawsuit. John J. Kelly 3rd, the Peekskill mayor, did not return a call seeking comment.</p>
        <p>The incident began at about 5 a.m. that Saturday morning when the officers armed with a no-knock warrant -- one in which no prior notice is required -- crashed through the door of Ms. James's third-floor apartment. Ms. James, 38 at the time, and her relatives, Winston Jones, 20, and Christine D. Jones and Denise Kim Jones, both 19, were sleeping when the officers arrived, Mr. Grimes said.</p>
        <p>He said that one of the women was wearing only underwear and that Mr. Jones was naked from the waist down, yet the officers herded the relatives into a common room, handcuffed them behind their backs and left them lying face down for more than two hours.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grimes said the officers insulted the family by using ethnic slurs and would not permit one of the women to use the bathroom.</p>
        <p>Mr. Florence denied that officers made ethnic slurs and said they eventually did allow the woman to go to the bathroom. He said the police left the apartment by 6:45 a.m., so the residents were not handcuffed for as long as Mr. Grimes contended. But, for the safety and security of the police and the residents, handcuffing was appropriate, Mr. Florence said.</p>
        <p>Ms. James's apartment came under police surveillance in early May after neighbors complained of unusually high numbers of people going in and out. Mr. Florence said an informant went into the apartment on May 6 and bought two bags of crack for $40. The next day a city judge issued the warrant.</p>
        <p>During the raid, no cocaine was found. But the police seized a ''chunk of marijuana'' from a hamper in the front bedroom and a box of ammunition for a .357 magnum in a space above a drop ceiling, Mr. Florence said. The police also noticed a large number of plastic bags, commonly used to package drugs, on a porch near the apartment entrance, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Florence defended the police decision not to arrest anyone, though marijuana was found, saying the department has a very conservative policy with regard to what type of evidence is required to make arrests.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grimes said that on their way out, the police told Ms. James they were looking for her son on the suspicion he was involved in selling drugs. But once it was determined that he was not in the apartment, he said, there was no reason to keep the rest of the family handcuffed for so long.</p>
        <p>''I mean, I have been on the street and it doesn't take two hours to secure your safety,'' he said. ''These people were not acting in any violent manner. They were outnumbered and outarmed.''</p>
