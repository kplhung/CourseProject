        <p>NINETY years ago today, in the choking heat of a summer without rain in the northern Rockies, the sun disappeared from the sky and a sound not unlike cannon fire began rattling throughout Montana and Idaho. The Big Burn, as the three-million-acre firestorm of 1910 was called, eventually consumed entire towns, killed 87 people and burned a lesson into the fledgling United States Forest Service.</p>
        <p>Thereafter, the service vowed, it would snuff out every fire, at one point swearing to do so by 10 a.m. on the day after the fire started. The best-known forester of that time, Gifford Pinchot, equated wildfire with slavery as a historic scourge of the nation. Another, Bernhard Fernow, blamed ''bad habits and loose morals'' for the fires.</p>
        <p>Now, in the midst of the worst wildfire year in nearly half a century, a new round of finger-pointing is under way. Touring Montana last week, J. Dennis Hastert, the speaker of the House, blamed the Clinton administration for not logging the tinder-dry forests. Environmentalists pointed at the timber industry and development for altering forest ecology and creating an artificial landscape ripe for catastrophe.</p>
        <p>But the Forest Service remains focused  on its own primary culprit: the symbol of fire eradication, Smokey Bear.</p>
        <p>The era of prevention and suppression represented by Smokey and his shovel may have been good for safety, but it was not the best thing for forests. The agency had reached that conclusion even before the additional evidence foresters drew from the fires that tore through almost half of Yellowstone National Park in 1988.</p>
        <p>Fire is as much a part of nature as creeks  and wildflowers. Most forests have a natural cycle, in which a purging burn comes through every 10, 20, 50 or 100 years. The cycle may be suppressed, foresters say, but only at the cost of more powerful fires when it re-emerges.</p>
        <p>''We have a problem when people say these fires are destroying all these areas,'' said Mr. Wiebe, the former Smokejumper. ''It's just not correct to say a forest is destroyed by fire.''</p>
        <p>During the decades when fires were routinely suppressed, forests choked themselves with excess growth, creating better habitats for tree-killing insects. The dying trees became tinder.</p>
        <p>''These forests are long overdue,'' said Mick Harrington, a research fire ecologist with the Forest Service in Montana, a state that has just been declared a disaster area. ''They were just ready to go.''</p>
        <p>The fires that have already run through five million acres this year are hotter, faster-burning, more ferocious than any burns of modern times, the people battling them say. And a number of reports say future fire seasons may be worse, identifying about 40 million acres of public land as being at risk of catastrophic fire.</p>
        <p>Fire suppression is only part of the problem. In some forests, experts say, logging has removed the biggest and most fire-resistant trees. Their replacements -- some planted, some natural -- are crowded stands of young and disease-prone trees, with 500 or more to the acre, where there used to be 50. Foresters also point to other elements -- excessive grazing by cattle and sheep, diversion of rivers to newly developing areas -- that have contributed to what some call ghost forests, spectral stands of diseased and dying timber now baking, if not yet burning, in the August sun.</p>
        <p>In addition, there are many new areas demanding fire protection. Homes and vacation cottages that have sprung up at the edge of national forest boundaries have become firefighters' front lines.</p>
        <p>''We've become so good at putting out fires because that's what the public wants,'' said Lindon Wiebe, a fire ecology specialist with the Forest Service in Washington, and a former Smokejumper, as the service's firefighters are called. ''But what we can do is pretty small compared to what Mother Nature wants to do.''</p>
        <p>Just as people have gradually learned not to build homes in areas prone to flooding, they need to understand the danger of erecting structures in fire zones, says Dr. Phil Omi, a professor of forest fire science at Colorado State University and director of the Western Forest Fire Research Center.</p>
        <p>''Somebody has got to get the message to these people that they are putting themselves at risk, whether it's the insurance industry or the government,'' Dr. Omi said. But he said he could not blame the Forest Service, or homeowners, for being slow to understand the nature of wild fire in the West. ''Our understanding of forest fire ecology is relatively new,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Those trying to address the future fire threat are focusing on two solutions: taking out more trees by logging or thinning, and deliberately setting fires.</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Clinton, logging in national forests has declined by nearly 75 percent,  and some critics blame this decline for the explosive fires. A number of Western senators back the idea of allowing the timber industry to remove more trees.</p>
        <p>However, environmental groups point out that the biggest fires in Montana and Idaho are burning not in wilderness areas, but in land that has been developed or logged. Such areas also account for 90 percent of the acreage identified as most vulnerable to  wildfire, the Forest Service says.</p>
        <p>''Commercial logging is not a prescription for forest health -- it is one of the major causes of unhealthy forest conditions,'' said Thomas Powers, chairman of the economics department at the University of Montana, whose specialty is natural resource issues.</p>
        <p>The other solution -- planned fire -- has become a public relations debacle. Last year, a record 1.4 million acres of Forest Service land was deliberately burned. Most  prescribed burns go off without trouble. But it only takes one to stir public ire. And this year, the one that got away, a 43,000-acre blaze set by the National Park Service near Los Alamos, N.M., destroyed more than 200 homes.</p>
        <p>And no matter how convinced the experts are that Los Alamos was an exception, the  fires now raging in every state of the West look horrific on television, blackening national treasures like Mesa Verde National Park and raining embers on popular campgrounds.</p>
