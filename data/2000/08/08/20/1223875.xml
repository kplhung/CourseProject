        <p>THIS suburb in the bistate Kansas City metropolitan area prides itself in being on the cutting edge when it comes to attracting growth-oriented business and industry to its modern corporate parks -- a philosophy that might seem to rule out much interest in a declining limestone mine.</p>
        <p>But as extraction slowed a few years ago at a 200-acre mine in the path of the community's westward growth, city officials wrote and enacted special building and zoning codes to permit the development of the cavernous space, 50 to 100 feet below the surface, as an industrial park.</p>
        <p>Today, 250,000 square feet of the underground Lenexa development is occupied by tenants, and 200,000 square feet is being readied for occupancy. The operator of the park, the Minneapolis-based Meritex Enterprises, is seeking tenants for the remaining area of about 2.5 million square feet.</p>
        <p>Lenexa and Meritex are the newest players in a half-century-old pattern in the urban area of Kansas City, Mo.-Kan., where an estimated 20 million square feet of business and industrial space -- more than 10 percent of the total -- has been created in former limestone mines. There are about 30 distinct underground business parks, led by the mammoth Hunt Midwest SubTropolis, a 913-acre world in itself with 6.5 miles of roads and 2.1 miles of rail corridors.</p>
        <p>''Cost is probably the most important reason why we are here in the underground -- it's a lot cheaper,'' said Garland J. Nall, site manager of Love Box Company, who supervises a 265-by-750-foot warehouse with 21 loading docks in the Lenexa development.</p>
        <p>But he said worker comfort was also a big plus. The natural temperature underground ranges between 56 and 64 degrees, rising according to the number of people working in a space and the length of time it has been occupied. Mr. Nall said the temperature level is ideal for warehouse workers, who usually have to tolerate extreme summer heat and chilly winter drafts in surface warehouses. Office workers often find the underground a bit cool and usually wear long sleeves and use small electric heaters in offices.</p>
        <p>About 400 businesses have operations in underground parks in and around Kansas City, employing about 4,000 people. There are a few other areas of the country that have, or are beginning, underground industrial development -- including Indianapolis, Louisville, St. Louis and an area north of Pittsburgh -- but Kansas City has the overwhelming majority of the space in use.</p>
        <p>''It's the result of a combination of geology and geography,'' said William E. Seymour, senior vice president of Meritex.</p>
        <p>Because of its central location, Kansas City is appealing as a national and regional distribution point, with easy access to interstate highways and rail lines. And the fact that it is situated on two thick layers of high-quality limestone -- the only source of construction aggregate for the area, which has no gravel piles -- led to a lot of mining, which, in turn, opened up vast underground spaces.</p>
        <p>''Mining started here around 1875-80,'' said Dr. Syed E. Hasan, a geology professor at the University of Missouri-Kansas City,  who has written extensively on underground development and mining. ''At first they were quarrying it, then around 1900 they started cutting into hillsides.''</p>
        <p>By the 1950's, the mining was being done with the future industrial use of the space in mind. Mine operators started using the ''room and pillar method'' -- carving the supporting pillars in a regular grid to allow space between them for roads and buildings. Today's pillars are typically 25 feet in diameter and spaced 60 to 65 feet apart, center to center.</p>
        <p>More than 10,000 massive whitewashed pillars support the 16-foot-high ceilings of the Hunt Midwest complex along the north bank of the Missouri River within the city limits of Kansas City, Mo.</p>
        <p>All of the pillars have numbers to help visitors locate specific businesses; regular exit signs help them find their way out. Fluorescent lights line the ceilings of the roadways, but looking down the long rows of pillars, especially in the unoccupied areas, still gives a sense of peering into the limitless unknown.</p>
        <p>Every day, about 400 tractor-trailer trucks make their way in and out of Hunt Midwest directly off Missouri Highway 210 just east of Interstate 435. They enter through a series of tunnel-like openings in a hillside that has been sliced open to reveal a wall of limestone. The surface of the site is occupied by two giant theme parks, Worlds of Fun and Oceans of Fun, and the mining operation of Hunt Midwest continues to extract two million tons of rock a year from part of the site.</p>
        <p>Thomas E. Steadman, vice president and general manager of Hunt Midwest Real Estate Development, said that adapting underground space for industrial and other uses is relatively simple. It involves painting the pillars, pouring concrete floors and roads, installing lighting and sprinkler systems, then putting up walls as required by tenants. Except for the ubiquitous rock pillars and the absence of outside light, an office in the underground looks very much like an office anywhere.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Seymour of Meritex said jokingly, ''The corner office doesn't get a window; it gets a pillar.''</p>
        <p>Operators of underground industrial parks say a tenant can occupy space in the  underground for about half what it costs to occupy a similar amount of space above ground. Lease rates start at about $2 a square foot annually, compared with about $3.50 aboveground. In addition, there are savings for construction because no roofs, foundations or exterior finishing are required. Energy savings are substantial.</p>
        <p>Mr. Seymour and Mr. Steadman said that tenants could expect to pay cheaper insurance rates, in part because the underground is secure from floods, tornadoes and other weather problems. Further, transient traffic through underground parks is rare; there are only a few entrances and exits, and breaking into a limestone cave is more than most burglars would attempt.</p>
        <p>Audrey Cop of the Arthur J. Gallagher insurance brokerage, which insures Hunt Midwest SubTropolis, though not the individual tenants, said that because the Hunt development ''would be a safe environment we believe a tenant would obtain more preferred rates.''</p>
        <p>UNDERGROUND developments have their own building and safety codes. Although there have been occasional mine collapses in this region in recent years, all are thought to have involved abandoned mines, most of them worked as much as a century ago without the balanced distribution of support pillars found in today's underground industrial parks.</p>
        <p>Brant Gaul, a Lenexa city planner who worked on the codes for the Meritex project, said that before any building permit is issued for the underground, every pillar is inspected for stability. The code also provides for annual inspections by independent geotechnical engineers, who measure the distance between floor and ceiling to determine whether there has been any movement in the rock. He added that the city government had so much confidence in the safety of the Meritex development that it had purchased 40 acres on the surface to build a public works service center.</p>
        <p>Underground developments are considered apt for a variety of uses -- particularly warehouses and distribution centers, light industry such as printing, records storage, and offices. Mr. Steadman said that about 70 percent of the 4.3 million square feet of occupied space in Hunt Midwest SubTropolis is used for warehouses and storage, 15 percent for manufacturing, 8 percent for freezing and cooling of food, and the rest as offices.</p>
        <p>The largest single tenant of the Hunt Midwest underground is the Postal Service, which operates two facilities in a total of 550,000 square feet. The larger operation is the nationwide distribution center for the booming business in collector's stamps. More than 200 employees process orders from philatelists along a mile of computerized conveyer belts. The other Postal Service facility serves as a regional distribution center for regular stamps.</p>
        <p>Mr. Seymour said that no business that uses hazardous or highly flammable processes can locate in an underground park, nor can any business that uses explosives or stores things that have a strong smell, such as rubber tires.</p>
        <p>''There is no heavy industry in the underground,'' he added, ''partly because we don't bring in natural gas, and a lot of those industries require gas.''</p>
        <p>At the other extreme, Hunt Midwest uses some of the SubTropolis space to host a biannual charity ball that regularly attracts more than 1,000 people in their black-tie finery. SubTropolis is also the site every February of a 10K race called the Groundhog Run. Laurie Wimberly, a marathon runner who has taken part in the Groundhog Run twice, said that the underground provided ''the perfect temperature'' for running in the middle of winter.</p>
