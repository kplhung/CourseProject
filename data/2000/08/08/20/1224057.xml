        <p>THIS season has witnessed a record number of hit batters and bench-clearing brawls, but so far nothing to match the most horrifying clash in baseball history. The racial tensions and tumultuous politics of the 1960's intruded on baseball 35 years ago Tuesday with a shock that many fans recall vividly today.</p>
        <p>What people remember is the violence. They do not recall, if they ever knew, the politics that fueled it. On Aug. 22, 1965, the Los Angeles Dodgers were playing the San Francisco Giants in a crucial game at Candlestick Park during perhaps the most bitterly contested pennant race in National League history. No other incentive would have been needed to pack the ballpark in a game between the two oldest rivals in the National League, but this one had the added allure of a marquee matchup between the league's best pitchers: the Giants' Juan Marichal and the Dodgers' Sandy Koufax.</p>
        <p>Neither ace was at his best that day, and by the third inning the score was 2-1, Los Angeles -- a typical score for a nine-inning Marichal-Koufax match. Marichal, who was not averse to throwing inside, knocked down Ron Fairly and Maury Wills. Koufax, who disliked brush-back pitches he was afraid might kill someone -- was pressured by his catcher, John Roseboro, to retaliate with a high-and-inside fastball when Marichal came to bat. On the next pitch, low and inside, Roseboro dropped the ball and picked it up behind Marichal. He then threw it back to Koufax, barely missing Marichal's head. Marichal thought it was closer than that; he would forever claim that the ball nicked his ear.</p>
        <p>''Roseboro was sending him a message,'' says Charles Einstein, a biographer of Willie Mays and a collaborator on Marichal's biography. Whatever message Roseboro sent, Marichal didn't like it. He spun around, bat in hand, and began screaming: ''Why you do that? Why you do that?'' (Einstein said some choice Spanish terms were sprinkled in as well.)</p>
        <p>What has been excised from our collective memory of the incident is that it was Roseboro who charged  Marichal, not the other way around. For most of the 42,000-plus crowd, the first indication that something was wrong came when they saw Marichal smashing Roseboro's head with his bat. Blood immediately began to flow from a deep scalp wound; to many stunned onlookers it appeared as if Roseboro's eye had been knocked out. Players and coaches on both teams rushed toward home plate. Willie Mays, a close friend of Roseboro's, got there first. He immediately grabbed the Dodger catcher, partly to protect him and partly, as he later revealed, to keep him from attacking Marichal. As Mays led Roseboro off the field he cradled his bleeding head and moaned, ''Johnny, Johnny, I'm so sorry.''</p>
        <p>When order was finally restored, a shaken Koufax walked the next two hitters and then gave up a three-run homer to Mays, giving the Giants a 4-2 victory. They may not have realized it that night, but the Giants season was over. Marichal, 19-9 before the incident, lost three of his last four decisions after coming back from an eight-day suspension, which was seen as remarkably light. (Marichal was also fined $1,750 by the league.)</p>
        <p>BRAWLS in the 1960's were nearly as common as today. Back then, many fights were caused by batters retaliating against pitchers, who were permitted a great deal of leeway in moving hitters off the plate. But no one could recall a fight in which a player attacked another player with a bat.</p>
        <p>The Marichal-Roseboro clash was all the more shocking because the men's behavior was entirely uncharacteristic. Roseboro, 32, was a solid, levelheaded player, and Marichal, 27, whose nickname was the Dominican Dandy, had a reputation as an amiable practical joker off the field.</p>
        <p>The sports media characterized the incident as racial, but in fact no racial antagonism survived it. What happened was the result of off-the-field pressures catching two ordinary men in an extraordinary situation. Roseboro, who later admitted to provoking the incident, was distraught, as were many other black players, over the mass disturbances that had been sweeping through Watts in his home city, Los Angeles. ''It was really the year I came of age,'' he said later. ''It was the first time I began to pick up a paper and skip the sports section altogether. Much of the time I was on the field I had to keep reminding myself that baseball was important. I'd wake up in the morning and say to myself, 'Why are they playing games? Why can't we do something about Watts and the people who live there?' ''</p>
        <p>Marichal had even more to think about. His native country, the Dominican Republic, was locked in a bloody civil war, and Marichal found himself rushing to the phone every day to check the fortunes of friends and family, particularly those of another Juan Marichal, his cousin, a politician who would become vice president the following year. ''Thinking back on it,'' Willie Mays said a few years ago, ''I really don't think Juan should have been playing at all. He was pretty strung out, full of fear and anger, and holding it inside. How can you tell a city and a team that they have to lose a pennant because of problems they don't know about happening thousands of miles away?''</p>
        <p>Summing it up years later, Roseboro said: ''For millions of Americans the pennant race was a diversion from the problems that were sweeping over the country. ''For some of us, it was just one more huge burden.''</p>
        <p>For Marichal, it was a burden that continued long after his playing days. Though he won more games than any other pitcher in the 1960's, he was snubbed for the Hall of Fame in 1981, his first year of eligibility, then again in 1982. He might not have made it in 1983 if not for a public campaign by Roseboro. A grateful Marichal thanked him.</p>
        <p>Maury Wills may have hit on the moral of the story several years ago when he said, ''Next time you see a ballplayer go a little nuts on the field, consider that he just might have as many off-the-field problems as you have.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 26, 2000, Saturday  A sports article last Sunday about the front-runners for most valuable player in baseball referred incorrectly in some editions to the two most recent players from New York teams to have won the award in the same year. They were Don Newcombe and Mickey Mantle, in 1956 -- not Sandy Koufax and Elston Howard, in 1963.</p>
