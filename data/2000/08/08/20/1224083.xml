        <p>Nell Merlino, the founder of Take Our Daughters to Work Day, came up with another big idea while she was attending a women's conference at the White House in 1997.

        <p>''Women own 38 percent of all businesses in the United States, but we continue to have less access to financing than male business owners,'' Ms. Merlino said. ''It was also clear that women are not getting the small loans they need to start or scale up small businesses.''</p>

        <p>Nell Merlino, the founder of Take Our Daughters to Work Day, came up with another big idea while she was attending a women's conference at the White House in 1997. To Iris Burnett, creator of the ''Erase the Hate'' tolerance campaign for USA Network, Ms. Merlino noted that, in financial terms, women were still being viewed as consumers but not as business owners.</p>
        <p>''Women own 38 percent of all businesses in the United States, but we continue to have less access to financing than male business owners,'' Ms. Merlino said. ''It was also clear that women are not getting the small loans they need to start or scale up small businesses.''</p>
        <p>So she and Ms. Burnett decided to organize Count Me In for Women's Economic Independence, an online micro-lender for women. They sought individual donations of $5 and up, because ''that's an amount most women can afford,'' Ms. Merlino said. They ran their concept -- for making loans of $500 to $10,000 -- past Geraldine Laybourne, a founder of Oxygen Media, and Nancy Evans, co-founder of iVillage.com, picking up advice and more financial support. Then they secured start-up funds from, among others, American Express, Verizon, the Lifetime cable channel and the foundation supported by the Calvert Group, a manager of socially responsible mutual funds.</p>
        <p>Ms. Merlino met with the first round of loan recipients a week and a half ago in Manhattan.  Thirty-six businesses -- including a beauty salon, a car detailing shop, a graphic design firm and a gift basket company run by women -- received loans.</p>
