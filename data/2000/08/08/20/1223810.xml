        <p>YOU never know what your kids are going to get into,'' Linda Kratt of Somerset County was saying the other day. If her voice contained equal parts of pride and befuddlement, it's easy to understand why: a few feet away sat her two sons, Chris and Martin, and in front of them at least a thousand young children were lined up, waiting for autographs.</p>

        <p>YOU never know what your kids are going to get into,'' Linda Kratt of Somerset County was saying the other day. If her voice contained equal parts of pride and befuddlement, it's easy to understand why: a few feet away sat her two sons, Chris and Martin, and in front of them at least a thousand young children were lined up, waiting for autographs.</p>
        <p>''I never would have guessed this,'' Mrs. Kratt said, shaking her head.</p>
        <p>The Kratt brothers are, at the moment, more popular than Springsteen, or Sinatra, or ''The Sopranos,'' or any other Jersey-bred icon. If, that is, you happen to be 5 years old.</p>
        <p>Their PBS television show, ''Zoboomafoo,'' has struck a rare chord with the younger set, thanks to the perfect combination of subject matter (animals) and presentation (goofy). Indeed, one suspects that the brothers may have had moments lately when they rued their never-send-a-kid-away-without-an-autograph policy.</p>
        <p>Take their appearance at the Philadelphia Zoo a few weeks back, part of a summerlong Zoo Tour that wraps up this weekend in Oakland, Calif. As soon as their live stage show ended at 1:45, they began signing autographs. They were still signing at 3. And at 4. And at 5.  And beyond.</p>
        <p>''I never would have guessed this,'' Mrs. Kratt repeated, looking out at the lines.</p>
        <p>Who would have? Chris and Martin Kratt's formative years in Warren Township three decades ago were like any other suburban childhood. Their parents were not veterinarians or wildlife biologists. (They own a company that makes pitch pipes and harmonicas and such.) Their house was not next to a zoo or game farm.</p>
        <p>Yet in the woods and fields of west-central New Jersey, supplemented by family camping trips to Vermont, the Kratt boys found the inspiration that has today made them the commanders of an army of four-foot-tall friends of wildlife. ''Zoboomafoo'' and ''Kratts' Creatures,'' an earlier show that was aimed at somewhat older children, have been seen all over the world. The summer Zoo Tour drew crowds everywhere it went -- at the Minnesota Zoo, for instance, where a typical Saturday gate is 7,500, Kratt Saturday attracted 15,000. And now the brothers are doing more than just talking about animals; they have recently established the first of what they think may become a chain of wildlife preserves. All from a childhood interest in the same bugs and reptiles and small mammals that a New Jersey kid might find today.</p>
        <p>''We were being 'creature adventurers' with domestic and wild animals ever since we were little,'' Chris Kratt, 31, said over lunch at a Philadelphia hotel. ''Creature adventurer'' is what the brothers answer when someone asks what their line of work is. It's also what they encourage their young viewers to become -- people who are always on the lookout for a chance to learn about animals in a nonintrusive way, whether by imitating the leap of a lemur or observing an ant colony in the back yard.</p>
        <p>''I was obsessed with box turtles,'' Martin, 34, recalled. ''I was able to recognize individual box turtles that used the area by their shell patterns. I thought that was fascinating.''</p>
        <p>Some of the boyhood creature adventures were more painful than others. ''When we went out with our St. Bernard, Heidi, we were always pretty sure to find a porcupine,'' Chris said. ''She was good at that.''</p>
        <p>Now the brothers can be found on weekday mornings in Animal Junction, the fictitious setting for their television show, a place where, on any given day, a young moose or a bighorn sheep or a fox might wander by.</p>
        <p>The Kratts aren't content merely to lecture about the animals; their approach is hands-on in a way that young children find riotous. For instance, to help make the point that a moose uses its face to feel around underwater for edible plants, Martin climbs right into the Animal Junction pond with the beast and drags his face through some soggy green growth. Just the way a kid might.</p>
        <p>''Maybe a big part of our success is that we're real guys from New Jersey who just started traveling around the world and meeting all these animals,'' Martin said. ''It's a fantasy dream for a lot of kids, and they see us as big brother-type figures who are actually doing it. Maybe it makes it seem like it's possible they could do it, too.''</p>
        <p>The just-a-couple-of-guys quality apparently isn't something the Kratts put on just for the television camera. When they turned up for the interview lunch, at a high-toned restaurant favored by business types in very expensive suits, they were in khakis and sandals and polo shirts -- roughly the same clothes they wear when they jump into a pond with a moose.</p>
        <p>How the Kratts got from box turtles in the backyard to where they are today is a tale made up of a lot of perseverance and a little happenstance. Their interest in animals influenced their collegiate choices -- Chris has a biology degree from Carlton College, Martin a zoology degree from Duke University -- but it was a trip to Costa Rica during a summer break in 1990 that really set them on the creature path.</p>
        <p>''Remember Crazy Eddie's?'' Chris said. ''That's where we got our first video camera.'' They took it with them on the trip and made tapes of themselves goofing around with the exotic wildlife they encountered.</p>
        <p>Back home in their parents' basement, they edited those homemade videos into five tapes, which they began taking around to schools in New Jersey and elsewhere in the East. They would give presentations a class at a time, going from the kindergartens to the first grades to the second grades and so on. It was experience that formed a foundation for everything that came later.</p>
        <p>''We learned about our audience,'' Martin said. ''We learned the differences in what excited kindergartners versus what excited fourth graders. And we got so much encouragement and positive feedback.''</p>
        <p>The feedback was enough to prompt them to take second trip, to Madagascar, where they shot more video. They could tell they were on to something from the reactions they were getting from children. It took a while, though, for the television executives they had begun approaching to see beyond the rough homemade videos and grasp the potential. Finally one of the Kratts' tapes landed on the desk of a Maryland Public Television official who took it home and showed it to his young son. And that was that.</p>
        <p>The brothers made 50 episodes of ''Kratts' Creatures'' from 1994 to 1996, traveling all over the world to film animals and animal adventures. Then, from 1997 to 1999, came 40 half-hour episodes of ''Zoboomafoo,'' which is produced in Canada. The brothers are now finishing up the editing on 25 new ''Zoboomafoo'' episodes.</p>
        <p>Each show generally has a theme -- animal defenses, for instance, or horns and other animal ''headwear.'' In the first 15 minutes, an animal comes to visit Animal Junction; in the second half, the brothers go on an expedition. The expedition is always preceded by a trip to the closet to get the necessary gear, and in a gag that preschoolers never seem to tire of, every time the closet is opened, an avalanche of things falls out on the brothers' heads.</p>
        <p>Assorted animal factoids are sprinkled throughout the shows, but the Kratts say the main idea isn't to impart to preschoolers that giant otters in the Amazon eat piranhas or that lemurs have special teeth that they use to brush one another's hair.</p>
        <p>''The most important thing is the attitude that people want to have animals around,'' Martin said. ''Our slogan is, 'Always give a creature his space,' and what we try to do with our tone and the way we act is kind of just show respect for the animals.''</p>
        <p>This, again, seems not to be a role the brothers are playing; it's a belief, as becomes apparent when they talk about some of the special moments they have had filming the show.</p>
        <p>'When we hung out with baby chimps,'' Chris recalled, still sounding awed, ''it truly was very similar to hanging out with little sisters or baby-sitting little kids, because they had fears. And they laugh. You tickle a baby chimpanzee and she laughs. And wants you to do it again. And if you walked away, she would chase you, grab your hand and pull you back.''</p>
        <p>His brother added: ''If you take a step back, take a giant step back, and just look at all the creatures, there are a lot more similarities between creatures than there are differences. An alien coming down to earth and looking at all these creatures, I'd be curious how that alien would classify everything. Could an alien tell the difference between a bear and a dog? When you look at them, they're all pretty close.''</p>
        <p>Creating children's television that embodies a grown-up world view but registers at a youngster's level isn't easy. A lot of shows that try end up being preachy or boring; a lot of other shows don't try at all. The Kratt brothers succeed because they haven't lost the ability to think like children.</p>
        <p>''For us,'' Martin said, ''learning equals fun. There's no difference between educational TV shows and entertaining TV shows. That's a false construct.''</p>
        <p>Thus someone tuning into ''Zoboomafoo'' at any given moment might see two men in their 30's leaping (one like a frog, horizontally; the other like a migrating trout, straight up, for comparison's sake), or getting drenched in slime, or falling fully clothed into the Animal Junction pond. Nature may be beautiful, but it's rarely clean. It seems likely that the nation's carpets have a lot more muddy footprints on them since the Kratt brothers hit the airwaves, and that parents are looking at their yards with a bit more trepidation than before.</p>
        <p>''I think one of the things that's most gratifying for me is that kids are going on their own creature adventures,'' Chris said. ''They go out in the yard and look at the bugs that they have, and they bring their parents out. They write us letters like, 'Today I forced my mom to learn about praying mantises.' ''</p>
        <p>There can be hundreds of such letters a week. (Though the brothers now live most of the year in Vermont, the Warren post office box mentioned at the end of their show is still emptied by Mom.) The true measure of their fans' devotion, though, may have been at the live shows this summer, where children of an age known for fidgeting stood in line for a very long time just to meet them.</p>
        <p>Some modest crowd-control measures have become necessary at these sprawling autograph sessions: one aide stands holding up a sign that says ''Chris'' and another holds a sign that says ''Martin,'' and the faithful queue up.</p>
        <p>At the Philadelphia show, an occasional whimper could be heard -- ''No, hon,'' one woman who had come over from Delaware told her child, ''I don't think the 'Chris' line is moving any faster than this one.'' A few parents were not quite as willing to wait it out as their children were. One mother could be heard trying to convince a skeptical daughter that if she stood just outside the canopy under which the Kratts sat -- mom would take a picture, the daughter in the foreground, Chris visible hazily about 15 feet behind her -- it would be ''just like you actually went up and met him.''</p>
        <p>For the most part, though, the fans, young and old, were patient (many of the mothers spending their line-standing time debating the relative cuteness of the two brothers, who are single). Once they reached the front, few were disappointed, because they were not just getting an autographed picture and a handshake. The brothers make a point of engaging the youngsters in conversation, asking about their favorite creatures, their favorite episodes of the show, and so on. The braver children or, more often, their parents will ask the brothers a question or two: How did you get into the wildlife business? Where did you grow up?</p>
        <p>''People are really surprised that we're two guys from New Jersey,'' Martin said.</p>
        <p>Added Chris, ''They expect us to be from Colorado.''</p>
