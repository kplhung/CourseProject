        <p>RAVERS are getting a lot of attention lately, especially for a community that has been an underground phenomenon for more than a decade.</p>
        <p>In the last year alone, performers like Moby and the Orb have started selling Calvin Klein jeans and Volkswagens; Sony Pictures Classics released the movie ''Groove,'' depicting an all-night rave in San Francisco; and Ecstasy, the popular euphoia-inducing drug, has appeared on the cover of numerous magazines and is currently at the center of national legislation calling for stiffer penalties.</p>
        <p>But despite all the hype, one essential element of raves has gone largely undiscussed: the dancing.</p>
        <p>Raves could not exist without dancing or electronic music. But while record companies have turned techno, jungle and trance into a multimillion-dollar industry, no one is churning out magazines or sponsoring online chats to promote rave dance. As a result, there is only a narrow vocabulary for what is probably the most significant and innovative American youth dance culture today.</p>
        <p>More than a dozen devoted ravers from around the country acknowledged in recent interviews that their high-energy, free-form dance steps are difficult to describe. Rave dancing is an instinctual, visceral response to the loud, thumping beats, they say.</p>
        <p>''Rave dancing is not choreographed,'' said Wyoming Telford, a 23-year-old cocktail waitress from Seattle who has been going to raves for seven years. ''You don't count steps, you don't have to work with other people, and you're not trying to evoke a story line. It's a pure transmutation of energy.''</p>
        <p>Though raves originated in Europe in the late 80's, the dance style is a distinctly American contribution. More than just dancers at a late-night club, most ravers are part of a community devoted to the hippy-esque mantra known as PLUR: Peace, Love Unity and Respect.</p>
        <p>Ravers may not learn their steps in a classroom, but they are as devoted to their dancing as ballerinas are to theirs. . Not unlike ballet or any other established genre, rave dancing requires dancers to possess tremendous passion and discipline both to excel and to avoid injury; ravers wear costumes (albeit ''phat pantz'' and sneakers, rather than tutus and tights), and the dancing consists of distinct techniques.</p>
        <p>Of current dance styles, rave most closely resembles break dancing. Both emerged out of American youth culture, namely hip-hop and raves, and both thrive on the democratization of dance, the notion that anyone can participate or perform.</p>
        <p>Many of the moves in rave dancing descended from hip-hop. Liquid, for example, is a slicker version of a hip-hop technique called popping and locking, in which a dancer moves an invisible ball of energy, held between both hands, quickly and seamlessly around the upper body.</p>
        <p>A more basic technique is the Nordictrack, jokingly named after the cross-country skiing motion one makes on the so-named exercise machine. A bouncier version of the hip-hop move known as Running Man, the Nordictrack is looked down on by some rave dancers.</p>
        <p>''It is essentially running in place,'' said James Brennan, 22, who last month drove from his home in Baltimore to a roller rink in the South Bronx for a rave called Progress, which doubled as a kind of voter-registration drive. ''Some people never progress beyond this point.  For those who choose to progress, the Nordictrack is the foundation on which they can build their individual style -- sort of like a shuffle in tap dancing.''</p>
        <p>Also popular at raves is Battling, in which a circle forms around individual dancers for a friendly competition, similar to break dancing.</p>
        <p>Dance styles also reflect regional differences. Ravers say that because the music in New York tends to be harder and faster, the movement is more rapid and aggressive. Ravers in places like San Francisco and Seattle are said to focus more on the music than the dancing, often facing the D.J., as opposed to each other, throughout a party. The Baltimore-Washington area is generally agreed to be the rave dance capital of the country and, not surprisingly, where Quixotica, the most prominent rave dance troupe, dances.</p>
        <p>Quixotica consists of eight young men and women whose moves are accentuated by such flamboyant costumes as cat suits with goggles and styrofoam-aluminum foil outfits like those worn by Japanese cartoon characters. They perform ''freestyle,'' meaning according to their individual interpretations of the music, in front of giant screens with projections of tie-dyed bubbles and other psychedelic images. The dancers don't get paid, but their $20 entrance fee is waived for a party they would probably attend anyway. The goal is to ''enhance the party vibe,'' says John Tab, a spokesman for Buzz, Washington's largest weekly dance party at which the group performs.</p>
        <p>Most of Quixotica's members have no formal dance training. In fact, many ravers had no interest in dancing until they heard electronic music for the first time. Then they couldn't stop.</p>
        <p>''One day it hit me that this music, and the way that I move to it, expresses who I am as a person,'' said Lucy Kafanov, an 18-year-old Manhattan raver who, in a green florescent wig, knee-length flannel shirt and extra-large pants, was registering people to vote last month at Progress. ''That is why I dance. It allows me to release myself in a safe and beautiful way. If I do pause to think, it's only to take a quick look around me and be thankful for the people that I have met, the music that has taken me on an intense spiritual journey and the movements that allow me to share my joy with the rest of the world.''</p>
        <p>Like most dancers, Ms. Kafanov views rave dancing as a form of self-expression. And like other dancers, ravers combine their interpretations of movement with skills and techniques they pick up by watching others.</p>
        <p>''Rave dancing is like folklore,'' says Angela Lin, 30, a graphic designer from San Francisco who was an extra in ''Groove.'' ''You learn a move from someone you see at a club, and you pass it on to another person that you won't even know is watching you.''</p>
        <p>But as raves become more mainstream, ''old-school'' ravers like Ms. Lin are troubled by what they see as a corruption of the vibe by newcomers who are more interested in looking cool than in dancing and the music.</p>
        <p>In Huge!, her zine dedicated to the rave scene, Stephanie Baker wrote, ''A new type of hopelessly confused scene newcomer is growing in number: the Wannabe Sketch Case.''</p>
        <p>The same is true for the D.J.'s, says Mr. Brennan, who is coming out with his own dance music CD titled ''Eros'' on the Shaken Not Stirred label. D.J.'s used to perform at raves ''to expose people to this strange, new, hypnotic sound,'' he said. ''Not to get paid.''</p>
        <p>Unsurprisingly, rave veterans say increased coverage of ravers by the news media has caught the attention of not only the newly curious but also the authorities. Buzz was shut down temporarily last year after a local television reporter went undercover to disclose drug use and heavy petting at the club. It has since reopened with stricter rules on age limits and rave paraphernalia, and ravers are now searched at the door by bouncers. ''It was worse than checking into customs,'' Ms. Lin said about the last time she was at Buzz, in April. ''People were getting yelled at for hugging each other.''</p>
        <p>The New Jersey Attorney General's office is circulating posters in clubs and schools with a photograph of a rave and a caption that reads: ''Narcs can dance.'' The intent, said Paul Loriquet, an agency spokesman, is to get ravers ''to think twice'' about drug use. In May, the city council in Chicago passed an ordinance that established stiff fines for rave organizers, and even D.J.'s, who operate without a license and required parties to shut down at 2 a.m. -- the height of the evening for ravers.</p>
        <p>RAVERS see such actions as a threat to the rave scene.  DanceSafe, a nonprofit group in San Francisco, is working to keep rave dancing alive by encouraging ravers to curb unsafe behavior, including the use of drugs, Ecstasy in particular. Emanuel Sferios, the group's executive director, says the greatest risk for those using Ecstasy is dehydration from overheating. That is why, he says, ''probably the most dangerous thing one can do when on Ecstasy is engage in an aerobic activity like dancing.'' But, he adds, since dancing is inevitable at raves, dancers are urged to stay cool, by taking breaks, wearing loose-fitting clothing and drinking lots of water.</p>
        <p>Ravers acknowledge that drugs are an integral part of the rave scene. But there are also devoted ravers, known as ''straight-edgers,'' who get their high from the music and the dancing.</p>
        <p>''I've been doing this for about eight years,'' said Mr. Brennan, who goes to clubs three times a week.  ''After a while you have to make a decision: do you want to dance or do you want to do drugs, because you can't do both forever.'' But, he added: ''I can't believe that anyone actually thinks stopping raves will end drug use, or even put a dent in it.  Drugs were around long before raves, and they will be around long after.''</p>
        <p>Luckily, the same thing can be said about dancing.</p>
