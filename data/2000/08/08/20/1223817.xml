        <p>TWO years after the death of the great Japanese director Akira Kurosawa at age 88, his memorial has finally kicked into high gear.</p>
        <p>In January, the Harvard Film Archive in Cambridge, Mass., ran a comprehensive series called ''Late Kurosawa,'' dedicated to the movies he made between 1970 and 1991 -- what Kurosawa aficionados would call his post-Mifune period.

        <p>TWO years after the death of the great Japanese director Akira Kurosawa at age 88, his memorial has finally kicked into high gear.</p>
        <p>In January, the Harvard Film Archive in Cambridge, Mass., ran a comprehensive series called ''Late Kurosawa,'' dedicated to the movies he made between 1970 and 1991 -- what Kurosawa aficionados would call his post-Mifune period. (The exuberantly physical actor Toshiro Mifune appeared in every Kurosawa movie but one between 1948 and 1965.)</p>
        <p>On Friday, ''Ran,'' Mr. Kurosawa's samurai version of ''King Lear,'' was re-released, having been given a shimmering new print to celebrate its 15th anniversary. Home Vision Cinema has just put out three of his least known pictures, ''Drunken Angel,''  ''Scandal'' and ''I Live in Fear,'' on videotape. And his last film, the 1993 ''Madadayo,'' will finally have its American theatrical debut, in New York on Sept. 1.</p>
        <p>It might seem strange to honor one of the world's legendary filmmakers with the opening of a movie that should have received an international release five years before his death rather than two years after it. But despite the esteem in which Mr. Kurosawa has been held for half a century -- since ''Rashomon,'' in 1950, made him famous beyond his own country -- it became increasingly difficult for Mr. Kurosawa to find financing.</p>
        <p>Between 1970 and 1990, he turned out fewer than half as many movies as between 1950 and 1960. His slowing down is attributable to the rising costs of producing films, to the decreasing interest of American moviegoers in foreign-language movies and, no doubt, to advancing age.</p>
        <p>Beyond these factors was his insistence on always seeking new challenges, which perhaps translated into too big a challenge for his audiences. From 1980 on, his films were released in the West mostly with the help of American filmmakers like George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola.</p>
        <p>These ''late'' Kurosawas were hard sells: they were generally long, more formal and measured -- more traditionally Japanese -- than the exciting, Western-influenced samurai films like ''Seven Samurai'' and ''Yojimbo'' that were his trademark in the 1950's and 60's.</p>
        <p>''Ran,'' which opened here to deserved acclaim in 1985, is a vivid example of how Mr. Kurosawa's style altered during his last two decades. The setting -- 16th-century Japan, a time of samurai and civil war -- is familiar from his earlier movies, and the film is his third radical reconfiguration of a Shakespeare text. ''Throne of Blood'' (1957), possibly his most magical film, starred Mr. Mifune as a samurai Macbeth. ''The Bad Sleep Well'' (1960) set ''Hamlet'' in corporate Tokyo, where the hero seeks revenge on the executives who drove his father to suicide; a film noir, it belongs equally to the category of revisionist Shakespeare and to the urban thriller genre that Kurosawa often trafficked in (''Drunken Angel,''  ''Stray Dog,''  ''High and Low'').</p>
        <p>IN ''Ran'' Mr. Kurosawa steps up the already considerable brutality of ''King Lear,'' substituting warrior sons for daughters. He also throws in a figure who crosses the savagery and sexual restlessness of Shakespeare's Regan with the ambition and manipulation of Lady Macbeth, adding, in Mieko Harada's audacious performance, a slithery sensuality that's all her own.</p>
        <p>But visually ''Ran'' isn't much like ''Throne of Blood'' or the other samurai epics, and the difference is not just in the astonishing, soaked color cinematography by Takao Saito and Masaharu Ueda. (Mr. Kurosawa worked exclusively in black-and-white until the 1970 ''Dodes'ka-den.'') In earlier movies, Mr. Kurosawa favored a broad, dense frame -- mood-drenched and teeming with activity -- and he liked to keep his camera close to the actors, rarely moving it back farther than middle range. There is hardly a close-up in the first hour of ''Ran,'' and though the screen is often packed with visual elements, it tends to be still, held in anticipation.</p>
        <p>Even once the movie plunges into battle and Mr. Kurosawa brings his protagonist, Hidetora (Tatsuya Nakadai), into focus, the meticulously staged fight scenes have a painterly quality; like those in the immediate predecessor of ''Ran,'' ''Kagemusha,'' they were clearly conceived in design rather than editing terms, a surprise development in the work of a filmmaker famous for his dynamic editing. This choice isn't mere perverseness. The visual style of ''Ran,'' which keeps the audience at a distance for so long, is consistent with its portrayal of Hidetora as essentially unlikable, both the product and the embodiment of a bloody, repugnant society. Mr. Kurosawa's aim is to compel us to weep for this man despite all the reasons we have to turn our heads away from his suffering; he wants to extract from us humanity without judgment. ''Ran'' is a masterwork, but such a tough, knotty one that its art house success in 1985 still seems miraculous.</p>
        <p>''Madadayo'' may seem even more exotic to American audiences than ''Ran.'' Its mood, like that of Mr. Kurosawa's penultimate movie, ''Rhapsody in August'' (1991), and some of the eight vignettes in his anthology film, ''Akira Kurosawa's Dreams,'' is contemplative. ''Dreams'' often takes the form of a meditation on the environment, and ''Rhapsody in August'' ruminates on the bombing of Nagasaki. ''Madadayo,'' less overtly didactic than either, is a meditation, too, and its subject is old age.</p>
        <p>The main character, Uchida (Tatsuo Matsumura), is a retired professor whose former students remain close to him in the last years of World War II. They help him relocate when air raids destroy his home; they give birthday banquets in his honor; they mobilize into a search party when his beloved cat disappears. Characterizing Uchida as ''lump gold'' -- gold without impurities -- they continue to treat him as a vital part of their lives. Every year on his birthday, they toast him with the question, ''Mahda-kai?'' (''Are you ready?''), meaning ''Are you ready to quit this life?'' And every year he answers, ''Madadayo'' (''Not yet'').</p>
        <p>An unhurried treatise on aging, in which the dramatic climax is the loss of a pet cat, would appear to be a bizarre swan song for the man whose movies influenced ''The Wild Bunch'' and ''Star Wars'' and Sergio Leone's westerns. But it is impossible not to see ''Madadayo,'' with its quiet resoluteness about forging onward, as a highly personal movie. It is Mr. Kurosawa's response to -- and perhaps his coming to terms with -- the waning of a long and distinguished career that encountered increasingly rocky terrain in its last three decades.</p>
        <p>Still, the theme of ''Madadayo'' and its spirit of smiling resistance may strike a chord with Americans that ''Dreams'' and ''Rhapsody in August'' failed to. It would be wonderful to see Mr. Kurosawa's movies occupying the position with audiences that Professor Uchida holds with his students -- not a memory of greatness but a living legacy.</p>
