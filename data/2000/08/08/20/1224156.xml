        <p>CNN has a correspondent and crew in place, just in case news breaks out in the woods. The other networks are following along as well, betting on the proposition that President Clinton, even while on vacation, will not be able to resist a camera and boom mike in his face.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Clinton's public schedule today was as clear as the summer skies here, and the reporters who follow him everywhere were advised by presidential aides, who meant no disrespect, to go take a hike. As if to prove that he is fully capable of ceding the spotlight to his vice president, Mr. Clinton has literally headed for the hills for a few days of vacation in the Adirondacks.</p>
        <p>He has been hiking in the woods and celebrating his 54th birthday with his wife and daughter -- all outside the view of the media. The plan is to lie low and allow Vice President Al Gore and his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, to take center stage for a while.</p>
        <p>But the president has not exactly disappeared. Mr. Clinton today signed the Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act, which finances the administration's worldwide response to those diseases.</p>
        <p>Also, Mr. Clinton stood at the side of Hillary Rodham Clinton at a Friday night rally for her Senate bid and spoke, albeit briefly, on her behalf.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton said that even though five months remain in his presidency, things have changed now that Mr. Gore has been tapped as the Democratic presidential nominee. Mr. Clinton said he was no longer the party leader -- as of Thursday night, when Mr. Gore delivered what the president praised as an ''extraordinary speech and a great road map for the country's future.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton, at the rally in Saranac Lake, N.Y., said he was already beginning the transition to private life. ''In this election, though I will be president and I have a lot I'm going to try to get done for you in the next five months, I am moving back to where I spent the first 20 years of my active life in politics,'' he said. That is, he said, as an envelope stuffer.</p>
        <p>Of course, Mr. Clinton is not quite yet an ordinary citizen, as his schedule over the coming weeks makes clear. He leaves next week for Nigeria to follow up on his 1998 tour of Africa and lend support to Nigeria's fledgling democracy. At the invitation of Nelson Mandela, South Africa's former president, Mr. Clinton  will also stop in Tanzania for a day to support the Burundi peace talks that Mr. Mandela is brokering.</p>
        <p>After several days in Africa, Mr. Clinton returns to Washington for a day, and is off to Colombia to support President Carlos Pastrana's fight against drug traffickers.</p>
        <p>Also on the schedule is a trip to the United Nations in New York for a gathering of world leaders that will be one of Mr. Clinton's final opportunities before he leaves office to say farewell to some of his colleagues.</p>
