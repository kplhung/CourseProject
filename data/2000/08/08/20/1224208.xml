        <p>No one has ever displayed a clearer definition of most valuable player than Chipper Jones did last September when the Mets, a mere game behind the Braves, played a three-game series in Atlanta. Hitting four home runs and driving in seven runs, Jones dominated the series, which the Braves swept to take a commanding four-game lead.</p>
        <p>Jones, who had had an M.V.P.-type season, clinched the National League award with that performance. Players should always make it that easy for voters.</p>

        <p>No one has ever displayed a clearer definition of most valuable player than Chipper Jones did last September when the Mets, a mere game behind the Braves, played a three-game series in Atlanta. Hitting four home runs and driving in seven runs, Jones dominated the series, which the Braves swept to take a commanding four-game lead.</p>
        <p>Jones, who had had an M.V.P.-type season, clinched the National League award with that performance. Players should always make it that easy for voters.</p>
        <p>With six weeks left in this season, the M.V.P. races have a collection of legitimate candidates, including one from each of the New York teams who could give the city a matched set of most valuable players for the first time since Don Newcombe and Mickey Mantle in 1956.</p>
        <p>At the moment, Mike Piazza of the Mets probably has fewer rivals for the award than does Bernie Williams of the Yankees, but too much of the season remains to attach the letters M, V and P to either one's name.</p>
        <p>The National League has a group who would be serious candidates if their teams were in a better location in the standing. Todd Helton of Colorado heads the group, which includes Vladimir Guerrero of Montreal, Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs and Jeff Bagwell of Houston.</p>
        <p>As the N.L. leader in batting average, on-base and slugging percentages, hits, extra-base hits, multihit games, total bases, doubles and runs scored (he is only second in runs batted in), Helton is clearly the league's player of the year. But that doesn't make him M.V.P., too. The beauty of the M.V.P. award is that it measures a player's value to his team, not simply a set of statistics.</p>
        <p>Helton has unquestionably been most valuable to the Rockies, but they were in the N.L. West race only briefly -- they were in first place June 18 and July 3 -- and not even Helton's torrid hitting the past couple of weeks has helped improve their standing.</p>
        <p>Given that the Los Angeles Dodgers are not much better off than the Rockies, Gary Sheffield's position among M.V.P contenders could be questioned. He has clearly been invaluable to the Dodgers, but their play has undermined his candidacy.</p>
        <p>Voting for the award is done by a panel of members of the Baseball Writers' Association of America, and the voters generally opt for players on contenders over players on noncontenders and for everyday players over pitchers. Everything else being equal -- not that everything ever is -- shortstops and catchers receive extra consideration for the difficulty of their positions.</p>
        <p>Piazza may have detractors for his catching ability, but he plays the position and has not allowed its rigors to prevent him from producing one critical hit after another or one series of hits after another.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, Piazza missed three games with a sprained left knee, then in his first three games back, 1. broke a game open with a three-run home run, 2. accounted for the first three runs by driving in two and scoring the other and later knocked in another run and scored another as the Mets won, and 3. ignited a third consecutive victory by slugging a two-run home run.</p>
        <p>Last month, Piazza cracked a grand slam that obliterated a 3-3 tie with Toronto four days after he hit two home runs in Boston, one that tied the score and one that won it. Piazza posted that performance less than a week after Roger Clemens hit him on the head with a fastball.</p>
        <p>The last time Piazza faced Clemens, June 9, he hit a third-inning grand slam that started the Mets toward a 12-2 victory. A week before the beanball he hit a three-run home run that climaxed a 10-run eighth-inning rally that beat Atlanta, 11-8.That shot came a couple of weeks after Piazza ripped a two-run home run against Trevor Hoffman in the 10th for a 5-3 victory over San Diego.</p>
        <p>Piazza's name doesn't appear among the leaders in as many offensive categories as Helton's, but he does lead Helton in one phase. Piazza entered the weekend with the N.L.'s best road average, .410, or 50 points better than Helton's.</p>
        <p>If Sheffield loses votes because of the Dodgers' failure to contend seriously, Piazza's prime challenge could come from Jeff Kent of San Francisco. One of the league's leader in runs batted in, Kent has been the Giants' most consistently productive hitter, even better than Barry Bonds, though Bonds could dilute Kent's chances in the voting.</p>
        <p>Jim Edmonds of St. Louis appeared to be a major contender earlier in the season, but without Mark McGwire in the lineup, he has not served as critical a role.</p>
        <p>Designated Handicap</p>
        <p>The American League balloting will be a test of the voters' view of a designated hitter as M.V.P. Frank Thomas of the Chicago White Sox and Edgar Martinez of Seattle have been extremely valuable offensively to their division-leading teams, but Martinez has been strictly a D.H. and Thomas has been a D.H. most of the time.</p>
        <p>Thomas won the award in 1993 and '94, but he was a first baseman then. Rafael Palmeiro of Texas finished fifth in last year's voting after serving primarily as a D.H., but he received 4 first-place votes, including 2 from the Texas writers, who selected him over Ivan Rodriguez, his teammate, who won the award.</p>
        <p>Carlos Delgado of Toronto has compiled the most impressive statistics, leading the league in total bases and on-base and slugging percentages, and holding a top-three spot in batting average, home runs, runs batted in and runs scored. Toronto, however, may have to win the wild card for him to have a chance.</p>
        <p>Bernie Williams's statistics don't compare with Delgado's, except for R.B.I. But he has been more responsible than any other member of the team for the Yankees' continued presence at the top of the A.L. East.</p>
        <p>From the second game of the season, which he won in Anaheim with a two-run home run in the ninth inning, Williams has staged a frequent one-man victory party. The Yankees were losing their home opener, 2-1, when he hit a three-run homer in an 8-6 conquest of Texas. The next week in Texas, he tied the score with a two-run homer in the seventh, and the Yankees won in the 11th.</p>
        <p>After losing two games to the Tigers late in June for a five-game losing streak in Detroit, the Yankees were in a scoreless game when Williams tripled home a run that ignited an eight-run outburst.</p>
        <p>In the first game of the second series against the Mets, Williams drove in the first run of a 2-1 victory. Against Philadelphia he hit an early home run, singled home the third run of a game-tying five-run rally and scored the tying run, then singled home the tying run in the 10th before the Yankees won.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month he wiped out a 3-0 Seattle lead with a three-run homer, sending the Yankees to a 13-6 victory. Just four days later he hit the first home run of the remarkable two-pitch, two-homer blitz against Jason Isringhausen of Oakland.</p>
        <p>Carl Everett of Boston is a candidate but lost ground when his temper tantrum gained him a 10-game suspension. Alex Rodriguez of Seattle and Jason Giambi of Oakland are candidates as well. If voters consider Martinez despite his D.H. status, he could hurt Rodriguez's chances.</p>
        <p>The most valuable players, however, may not have been determined. Candidates have six weeks to do a Chipper Jones imitation.</p>
        <p>Not a Ballpark Figure</p>
        <p>She was born in Los Angeles and lives in New York, but 17-year-old Elizabeth thinks Chicago. She has good reason to; she and the city have a famous name in common.</p>
        <p>She is Elizabeth Wrigley-Field and she is proud of it.</p>
        <p>''I don't know of anyone else with the name,'' she said. ''I don't believe there are any other Wrigley-Fields. I've made a few attempts to find someone else, but I never have.''</p>
        <p>Her parents are not crazy Cubs fans who adopted the park's name.</p>
        <p>''My mom is Wrigley and my dad is Field,'' she said. ''They named me Elizabeth Field. They thought if I was named Wrigley-Field I'd be teased a lot. When I was in first grade, I decided that would be a mistake. I wanted to have both my parents' names because I thought that would be fair, but I also thought it would be cool to have the name Wrigley-Field.''</p>
        <p>So cool, in fact, that she is taking steps to make that her legal name.</p>
        <p>''I've been Wrigley-Field in the school system as long as I've been in New York,'' said Elizabeth, a Hunter High School senior, whose family moved to New York when she was 9. ''But we're getting my name changed now because I'm about to go to college and I don't want there to be any question about it.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Wrigley-Field, who has no brothers or sisters to share the name with, recalled: ''People hearing my name for the first time, especially substitute teachers, would have big reactions. In ninth grade I was on the debate team, and that's when I was first introduced to masses of people at tournaments. People would laugh when I went up to get my awards. I thought it was kind of funny, too.''</p>
        <p>But she has also found that her name creates an easy way to begin a conversation with someone she doesn't know.</p>
        <p>Ms. Wrigley-Field has never been inside Wrigley Field. But she may make a visit during the coming school year. She hopes to attend Harvard or the University of Chicago, and if she goes to Chicago to visit that school, she said, she hopes to go to the park.</p>
        <p>Now one would think that Ms. Wrigley-Field is a big baseball fan. ''Not really,'' she said, speaking from Kassel, Germany, where she has been studying this summer. ''I am a Cubs fan, but I don't believe I would be were it not for this unusual circumstance. I don't really follow baseball, but when I'm near a baseball paraphernalia store, I go in and look for Cubs things.''</p>
        <p>From her collection of Cubs things, she said, she especially likes her Wrigley Field playing cards. What teenager wouldn't like a deck of cards with such a personal label?</p>
