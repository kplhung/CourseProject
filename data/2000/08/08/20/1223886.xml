        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Herbert Muschamp's ode to Lever House [''How Modern Design Remains Faithful to Its Context,'' Aug. 6] recalled for me an experience I had in 1954. I was showing the magnificent structure to some Japanese carpenters who had been brought to New York to assemble the Japanese house in the garden of the Museum of Modern Art. John D. Rockefeller III, then president of the Japan Society where I worked, had hoped that the carpenters might recognize some of the Japanese influences on American architecture.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Herbert Muschamp's ode to Lever House [''How Modern Design Remains Faithful to Its Context,'' Aug. 6] recalled for me an experience I had in 1954. I was showing the magnificent structure to some Japanese carpenters who had been brought to New York to assemble the Japanese house in the garden of the Museum of Modern Art. John D. Rockefeller III, then president of the Japan Society where I worked, had hoped that the carpenters might recognize some of the Japanese influences on American architecture.</p>
        <p>I tried to explain the interplay of indoors and outdoors as manifest in Lever House. The carpenters were enchanted, but they did not grasp my point. Instead, they looked up at the shimmering glass walls and told me they were reminded of ''a dancing lantern in a bon odori festival.'' It was a superb example of selective perception, and a great tribute to the architects who designed what Mr. Muschamp described as ''the tower's floating base.'' All these decades later, I continue to see Lever House dancing.</p>
