        <p>Probably thousands of children disappeared in Guatemala's 36-year civil war, the vast majority taken by the security forces, typically after the army had attacked a Mayan Indian village and massacred many of its inhabitants. While most of the children were probably killed, there is reason to think that many of the younger children were adopted illegally by soldiers or taken to orphanages and later adopted by families in other countries, including the United States.</p>
        <p>The whereabouts of abducted children has become a major issue in Argentina, where mothers and grandmothers of children who disappeared during the ''dirty war'' of the 1970's brought this horror to international attention. In El Salvador, a nongovernmental group, Pro-Busqueda, has reunited dozens of children with their biological families.  But with war increasingly fought in villages instead of battlefields, more nations need to find abducted children and connect them to their families.</p>

        <p>Probably thousands of children disappeared in Guatemala's 36-year civil war, the vast majority taken by the security forces, typically after the army had attacked a Mayan Indian village and massacred many of its inhabitants. While most of the children were probably killed, there is reason to think that many of the younger children were adopted illegally by soldiers or taken to orphanages and later adopted by families in other countries, including the United States.</p>
        <p>The whereabouts of abducted children has become a major issue in Argentina, where mothers and grandmothers of children who disappeared during the ''dirty war'' of the 1970's brought this horror to international attention. In El Salvador, a nongovernmental group, Pro-Busqueda, has reunited dozens of children with their biological families.  But with war increasingly fought in villages instead of battlefields, more nations need to find abducted children and connect them to their families.</p>
        <p>The war ended in 1996, but Guatemalans are  only now beginning to realize the dimensions of this problem. The Archdiocese Human Rights Office of Guatemala City's Roman Catholic Church recently released a report that documents the cases of 86 children who disappeared and lists hundreds more.  Independently, a new group called Watch (watchproj@aol.com) is being set up in Guatemala and Chicago, to collect information and begin efforts to find children. But the archdiocese office, like the nation's truth commission, which published its report last year, urges that the government set up an organization. A governmental group would be best at spreading the word to Mayan communities that vanished children might be alive and also at ensuring the safety of families who look for them. More important, only a governmental group can combat the obstruction of the armed forces, which has been a problem in Argentina and El Salvador.</p>
        <p>President Alfonso Portillo seems more willing than his predecessor to help victims of the war. Guatemala has announced that it will admit state responsibility, pay reparations and push for justice in 60 cases of atrocities that Guatemalan groups had taken to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. This is groundbreaking, but justice may remain an empty promise given that the still-powerful military is defiant and human rights activists continue to be intimidated and killed. A priority for investigation should be the children who have disappeared. This is one instance where those presumed dead could indeed be brought back to life.</p>
