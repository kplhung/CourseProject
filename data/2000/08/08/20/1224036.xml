        <p>ONE thing you learn quickly about Ken Kurson, who as founder and editor of Green magazine has become the financial mentor for the Limp Bizkit set: he does not have an ounce of pretension. He is slightly rumpled, chronically bemused. During a conversation, a mischievous glint leaps out of his eye. He always looks ready to hop on his Vespa motorcycle to take a friend on his ''Sopranos'' tour of New Jersey. And that's precisely the point.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kurson, who is 31, has made personal finance palatable for people who might otherwise believe that it belongs on the shelf with Geritol and Dentu-Creme. He derives enormous pleasure from explaining in everyday language the murky world of stock indexes, P/E ratios and betas.</p>

        <p>ONE thing you learn quickly about Ken Kurson, who as founder and editor of Green magazine has become the financial mentor for the Limp Bizkit set: he does not have an ounce of pretension. He is slightly rumpled, chronically bemused. During a conversation, a mischievous glint leaps out of his eye. He always looks ready to hop on his Vespa motorcycle to take a friend on his ''Sopranos'' tour of New Jersey. And that's precisely the point.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kurson, who is 31, has made personal finance palatable for people who might otherwise believe that it belongs on the shelf with Geritol and Dentu-Creme. He derives enormous pleasure from explaining in everyday language the murky world of stock indexes, P/E ratios and betas.</p>
        <p>His common-sense views -- already heard in his guest appearances on CNN, CNNfn, ABC, MSNBC and National Public Radio's ''Marketplace'' -- are getting a wider audience. Early last month, Green began providing two articles a week to the business section of Salon, the online magazine. Also in July, he began twice-a-week  appearances on ZDTV, the Ziff-Davis cable channel, directly from Green's offices. Next month, United FeatureSyndicate (Peanuts, Miss Manners, Dilbert, etc.) will begin selling a weekly package of Green content to newspapers.</p>
        <p>Mind you, all this is not Money for Morons. For all his glibness, Mr. Kurson is very serious -- passionate, really -- about showing young people the money. ''Five years ago, I paid a couple hundred bucks for the trademark to the phrase 'Personal Finance for the Unashamed,' and that's who Green is for -- those who don't care how cool it is to admit they care about their lives and their futures,'' he said at a restaurant near his Midtown Manhattan offices.</p>
        <p>His advice is wide-ranging. He adheres to the idea that an investor should subtract his age from 100 and invest the remainder, as a percentage, in stocks. But he says a sector fund can be a good compromise between the passivity of investing in a general mutual fund and the ''take-chargedness of individual stock-picking.''</p>
        <p>In the preface to his book, ''The Green Magazine Guide to Personal Finance,'' (Doubleday, 1998), he wrote: ''It's not about the ability to quit your job at any moment or to jet off to suave locales. It's about knowing that you have some control over the things that matter to you. It's about working at a job because you love it, because it elevates you, instead of because you're deeply in debt, stuck with rent you can't afford or so afraid of investing you bury your savings in jars, scattered around the backyard.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kurson does have the backyard, if not the jars. He lives in Montclair, N.J., with his wife, Rebecca, a literary agent. He keeps the Vespa and a Harley Davidson in the garage.</p>
        <p>David Granger, editor in chief of Esquire, saw  Mr. Kurson's noncomformist streak in full color as soon as he chose him to write a monthly money  column, ''Green,'' in 1997. ''The day I told him he got the job, he went out and dyed his hair orange,'' Mr. Granger recalled.</p>
        <p>But then Mr. Kurson has always believed that money matters should be fun. ''I've never met anybody who thought they could bring joy to people by telling them how to spend and save it,'' Mr. Granger said. ''He might be the only financial writer in the world who makes that part of his mission. He has a real feeling that understanding personal finance can improve people's lives.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kurson says his financial skills date from the late 1980's, when he played bass in a Chicago punk rock band called -- you guessed it -- Green.  He ended up in charge of the band's books and contracts.</p>
        <p>In 1993, he headed to New York, figuring to get into journalism, and landed internships and jobs at Rolling Stone, Harper's and Worth. (He had attended the University of Chicago for two years, but he calls college ''soul-deadening.'')</p>
        <p>In 1995, he compiled an irreverent eight-page publication, calling it The Kenny Quarterly, which he furtively photocopied at his day job as an editor at United Media and distributed to friends in need of financial advice. It was a hit -- especially among investment professionals who in turn gave it to friends and family who hadn't previously found discourse about Simplified Employee Pensions particularly fascinating.</p>
        <p>In late 1995, he and his best friend, John Packel,  turned The Kenny Quarterly into Green. It now has a paid circulation of 25,000, with enhanced prospects for growth since Eastern Distributors, a major magazine handler, recently agreed to carry it. The Web site has 335,000 unique users, according to PCData Reports last month.</p>
        <p>A year ago, the magazine and the Web site, www.greenmagazine.com, were bought by Ilife.com (formerly Intelligent Life), based in North Palm Beach, Fla., and the owner of financial sites including Bankrate.com,  for about $830,000 in cash and stock, plus options.</p>
        <p>''Am I doing well? Absolutely,'' he said. ''My dad was a traveling salesman of motorcycle parts. Some years were good; others we had to sell our piano and all our furniture. I probably make more than he ever did. But I'm poorer than 90 percent of the people I've interviewed in my career as a business journalist. I'm on the phone all day with people, many of whom are brilliant and hard-working but plenty of whom are lazy dunces -- who spend more than my annual income on wine.''</p>
        <p>He sees few limits to young people's appetite for what he is serving up. ''The Internet has changed just about everything,'' he said. ''Not the fundamentals of corporate economics, but the way we live. Green is for a person who essentially didn't exist as recently as 10 years ago: the guy who likely won't stay in a job long enough to learn where the bathroom is, let alone retire with a gold watch; the gal who never wanted to learn the word mutual fund and suddenly finds herself controlling a substantial sum of money that can be invested in any of 7,923 funds, or thousands of stocks. These are people whose parents told them even less about money management than they did about religion and sex.''</p>
        <p>Nor, despite his anti-establishment roots, will he apologize for being a die-hard capitalist. ''I write about money for two reasons,'' he said. ''It fascinates me, and it is the most powerful way for people I care about to enact the kinds of lives they want and deserve.''</p>
        <p>PRIVATE SECTOR  Correction:  September 17, 2000, Sunday  An article on Aug. 20 about Ken Kurson, founder and editor of Green, a personal finance magazine, misstated the name of the distributor of ''Marketplace,'' a radio program on which he has appeared.
