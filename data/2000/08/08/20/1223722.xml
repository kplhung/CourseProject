        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As the former deputy executive chairman of the United Nations Special Commission, I would like to reply to Barbara Crossette's review of ''The Greatest Threat,'' by Richard Butler (July 9). Butler directs criticism at the Iraqis, the Secretary General of the United Nations and certain members of the Security Council (especially Russia) for the ultimate end of Unscom. Crossette's assessment of Butler's thesis addresses the political aspects of this saga. However, she notes that the story is ''rich in vivid detail.'' The details in the book may be vivid, but are frequently wrong.</p>
        <p>One example of this inexactitude concerns a $5 wager between Butler and me that serves as the title of a chapter. The amount of the bet and the fact that Butler won are correct. However, the time, location and subject are all wrong. Butler states that the bet concerned whether Iraq would throw us out at the end of our last set of meetings with Tariq Aziz on Aug. 3, 1998. The bet took place on the plane out of Baghdad the following day and addressed the question of whether we would ever return to Iraq.</p>
        <p>So what? Well, getting the details wrong assists those who would dismiss all the data and conclusions painfully acquired by Unscom experts. The specifics of the way experts conducted their work and achieved remarkable results over Iraqi obstructions on the ground are not accurately rendered. Many members of the Security Council (perhaps all) would prefer to forget about Unscom and its reports on Iraq. The incomplete resolution of Iraqi disarmament is a black spot in the council's recent past, and there are incentives and actions by all permanent council members to airbrush this imperfection out of the picture.</p>
