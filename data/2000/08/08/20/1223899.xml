        <p>SOMETIMES, if the house you want isn't for sale, you have to entice the people to move by offering something they want even more.</p>
        <p>Your house, perhaps.</p>
        <p>For 15 years, Camilla Calhoun and Aldo Rafanelli lived in a wonderful old place on an acre and a half in Millwood, in Westchester County, next to a nature preserve with 140 acres. It was definitely private. But, any time they wanted a magazine, or a quart of milk, they had to get in the car and go out. Their older son, Marco, was in college, and their younger one, Alessandro, was about to go.  Suddenly, their house seemed way too big and way too much work. ''The  kids were not going to be around to cut the grass,'' Mr. Rafanelli said.</p>
        <p>But finding a house in the suburbs is only marginally easier than finding an apartment in Manhattan. Prices have been escalating, and in the most sought-after towns, there isn't much on the market. Wanting to cut down on maintenance chores, they first tried condominiums, but ''we couldn't find any lovable, or likable, condos,'' Mr. Rafanelli said.</p>
        <p>Then one day Ms. Calhoun was driving around with a broker in the village of Tarrytown and passed Grove Street, which she had always admired for its collection of architecturally arresting houses.</p>
        <p>She pointed to a particular one she liked, manageable in size but charmingly Victorian, and the broker said that the people who lived there were looking for a larger place because they had three young children and were definitely too crowded. But they had been looking for quite a while and hadn't yet put their own house up for sale. Ms. Calhoun asked to be notified if the house went on the market.</p>
        <p>SOON after, she and her husband found a house they liked well enough, and they made a bid on it. They weren't in love with it, but choices were limited. ''You have to think of a market where they take you around and there's nothing for sale,'' Mr. Rafanelli said. But Ms. Calhoun couldn't get the other place out of her head, and so she asked the broker to suggest a trade: their large house, which has the additional lure of being in the highly regarded Chappaqua school district, at the market price, for the Grove Street house, at the market price.</p>
        <p>The broker for the other couple said she would come over immediately and assess the possibilities. She did, Ms. Calhoun said, and ''she said, this is definitely it.'' The next day, Ms. Calhoun and Mr. Rafanelli went to look at the house on Grove Street, and they, too, were sold. After a bit of negotiating, they worked out the sales, setting a price of $624,000 for the larger house and $349,000 for the smaller one.</p>
        <p>A month ago, Ms. Calhoun and Mr. Rafanelli moved into the house, which is perched high on a hill above the Hudson River. ''They left us wine, we left them wine,'' Ms. Calhoun said. ''Neither family wanted to leave.''</p>
        <p>Like their old house, this one has four bedrooms, but all the rooms are much smaller. Their distinguished furniture, much of it from Mr. Rafanelli's family home in Florence, more than fills the space. ''It looks like an antique shop more than a house,'' he said. But they are adjusting to the smaller space, and thinking of doing some renovations that will make the main floor more open and give the dining room a river view.</p>
        <p>Their new house is just 15 minutes  from the old one, but it's a completely different way of life. In the evening, they can stroll down the hill to the village shops, maybe sit in a cafe and watch the people go by. At their old house, they couldn't even go for walks in the evening, because there were no sidewalks.</p>
        <p>''We like the village life,'' Mr. Rafanelli said. ''I can buy bagels without getting into the car. Here, you have everything you need.'' It reminds him of home. ''The village is everything in Italy,'' he said. ''There is no such thing as suburbia.'' Ms. Calhoun, an environmental consultant, calls it the ''anti-sprawl choice.''</p>
        <p>Still, it's a radical change, and there are reasons that people like sprawl. Here, their neighbors are quite visible. And sometimes audible. ''The first morning we woke up, we heard somebody coughing,'' Ms. Calhoun said. ''We had never been in a neighborhood before. It's a little more intimate.'' But they joke that the move will change their personalities for the better. ''I'm going to be very calm and quiet,'' Ms. Calhoun said. In the old house, her husband said, ''You could scream at the kids all the time.''</p>
        <p>But they obviously relish the large porch with the panoramic view of the river. On a recent evening, they were drinking some wine from Villa Antinori (Mr. Rafanelli oversees its marketing and sales for North America) and preparing to grill some fish.</p>
        <p>SINCE they moved in, they have only eaten indoors twice. Now, they can't just walk out to their garden to pick some herbs, because they don't have one. But there's a good gourmet shop nearby, and Mr. Rafanelli says he doesn't really miss the battle of the garden. ''I had a large vegetable garden to be defended every year against the wild,'' which included coyotes and turkeys, he said.</p>
        <p>Talking and watching the river view, Ms. Calhoun suddenly looks away, seeing something out of the corner of her eye. Then she realizes: ''That was a bird. I didn't know if I would see any more birds.''</p>
        <p>Once they are more settled, they plan to take advantage of their new environment, more watery than woody. For her birthday in March, Mr. Rafanelli gave his wife a kayak. By the end of this month, they'll be empty-nesters, responsible only for their dog, D'Oro. It's a very different time for them. As Mr. Rafanelli puts it, ''Camilla's going to go kayaking, and I'm going to go fly fishing, and no one's going to cut the grass.''</p>
