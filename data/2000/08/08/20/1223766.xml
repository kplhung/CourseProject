        <p>I'M uncomfortable around animals that stand taller than I do and can eat me. I don't water-ski and I don't enjoy riding in tiny airplanes that do. I'm wary of icy sidewalks, so the thought of having lunch on a mountain of ice 1,000 feet thick tends to chill my appetite.</p>
        <p>In short, Alaska is the kind of place that intimidates me.</p>
        <p>Yet a camping trip to Alaska last summer -- including excursions on seaplanes, encounters with wildlife, even a picnic atop a glacier -- turned out to be an excellent way for a first-time visitor to experience in two weeks a good helping of this preposterously huge and nearly roadless state. And a local touring outfit called CampAlaska was up to the logistical task, providing an invaluable driver-guide, good food, transportation and all camping equipment besides personal gear and sleeping bags.</p>
        <p>Our 14-day Sourdough package took my wife and me to some of Alaska's loveliest and most memorable sites: Denali National Park, where we rafted down a glacial river; the little-visited Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve, with its fields of summer wildflowers; and Childs Glacier on the salmon-rich Copper River. In between our wilderness adventures, we visited Seward, Valdez, Cordova and other Alaskan towns.  As for our travel companions -- I had visions of trying to keep up with hard-bodied youngsters with crampons clamped to their high-tech hiking boots. But it was a mixed lot that assembled for various itineraries Sunday morning at our hotel near Anchorage International Airport, in couples and singles, ranging from their late 20's to their late 50's. From throughout the United States and from Germany, Japan and India, all had done some camping and hiking, but most were visiting Alaska for the first time.</p>
        <p>Our personable, knowledgeable guide was Bill Dyke, at 32 a veteran member of the 15-year-old CampAlaska company. After a trip  to Anchorage's largest supermarket for last-minute perishables, our group of five headed south in a 12-passenger van on the Seward Highway.</p>
        <p>Early on in the 108-mile route we stopped at Beluga Point, where we failed to see any of the whales that purportedly frolic in the Turnagain Arm of the Cook Inlet. We also passed through no fewer than three locations called Moose Pass, whose moose apparently had already passed. Later Bill excitedly braked at the foot of a high slope of the Chugach National Forest to point out tiny white specks he claimed were dall  sheep. Through my binoculars the tiny white specks appeared only as larger white specks. I felt fated to be the first visitor to Alaska to encounter no wildlife.</p>
        <p>I certainly had no complaints when we stopped near Seward for our first hike along a level, three-mile trail. Here in the Kenai Fjords National Park we came within 20 yards of the startlingly blue, 150-foot-high Exit Glacier, part of the great Harding Icefield.</p>
        <p>We didn't linger long in Seward, a not-especially-attractive fishing and ferry port at the head of Resurrection Bay on the Kenai Peninsula. Seward was largely destroyed by a tsunami caused by the 1964 Alaska earthquake. Rebuilt or not, nothing in Seward commanded attention as much as the surrounding mountains.</p>
        <p>We set up for our first night's camping at Miller's Landing, on the bay two miles south of town. The site offered few amenities, but the choice was felicitous for its thick and fragrant spruce forest and for the bald eagles that favor the area. After patiently instructing his tenderfoot charges in assembling the company's two-person tents, Bill prepared our dinner of fresh halibut with pesto baked in a Dutch oven and salad  (wine was provided by individual campers), we cheerfully made the coffee and did KP; Bill usually refused help with the cooking itself.</p>
        <p>Despite this happy picture, camping in Alaska has its downside. One is rain; parts of Alaska record annual precipitation in feet, not inches. Fortunately, only twice during our two weeks did it rain briefly, and never enough to interfere with our activities.</p>
        <p>A more certain camping discomfort is mosquitoes; like everything else in the state, the mosquitoes we encountered were oversize, if lethargic. We were never entirely free of them, but only once -- on the Copper River delta -- were we forced to don head nets at our campsite.</p>
        <p>A third irritant is the perpetual summer daylight. While the constant light allows for nonstop sightseeing,  it largely obviates one of camping's great pleasures, the campfire. We dutifully built a fire every night, but darkness never arrived to justify it. Most nights remained light enough for reading inside the tents.</p>
        <p>Next morning, I was up hours before sunrise, or would have been if the sun had ever set. After a breakfast of cold cereal, pancakes, fresh fruit and coffee, we campers had a choice of activities out of Seward,  and my wife and I chose the seven-and-a-half-hour cruise and salmon bake with Kenai Fjords Tours.</p>
        <p>Heavy seas prevented the boat from venturing into other inlets of the Kenai Fjords National Park. But we did sail for four hours, and the tour operators cheerfully refunded all passengers a third of their fares.</p>
        <p>After the salmon bake on Fox Island, we thrilled to the thickly forested mountainsides of the bay, still spattered with snow in midsummer. And we saw abundant wildlife, including puffins, Steller sea lions and -- most spectacularly -- a humpback whale, which we could photograph at close range for nearly an hour.</p>
        <p>Back in camp for supper, Bill treated us to two-inch-thick steaks, baked potatoes, salad and apple crumble baked in the Dutch oven. In the long light of evening we were able to observe the eagles, stroll the beach, or sit in the campsite office where we could sample pickled halibut from an iron pot.</p>
        <p>Heading north of Seward the next day, we stopped at the Portage Glacier Recreation Area in the Chugach National Forest. The glacier, which lurks behind an ice-filled lake, is one of the most popular tourist sites in  Alaska. By noon we were having a tailgate lunch as our van stood in line for loading onto a train from Portage to Whittier, which is one fjord over the mountains. Passengers stayed in their vehicles, which were carried on flatbed railway cars through funhouse mountain tunnels -- the only darkness we would experience in two weeks. (Vehicles can now make the trip through the tunnels without using the train.)</p>
        <p>In Whittier, where all 300 residents live in one huge apartment building, Bill drove the van into the belly of a Marine Highway System ferry, and for the rest of the day we relaxed topside, photographing the 35-mile-wide Columbia Glacier as icebergs drifted by.</p>
        <p>We debarked at the port of Valdez, historically one of the major gateways to Alaska's gold fields and today the shipping terminus of the 800-mile Trans-Alaska oil pipeline. After setting up the tents on the edge of town at the Eagle's Rest campground, we ventured into one of the numerous waterfront saloons. This was the sort of place that featured wailing country music, Harley-Davidson devotees at the pool table, and a poster that read: ''Earth First! We'll Log the Other Planets Later.'' From what I can recall, a good time was had by all.</p>
        <p>The next day was devoted to hiking the mountains and admiring the Bridal Veil Falls in nearby Keystone Canyon. The following morning we  drove to Robe Lake, seven miles out of town, and flew in a float plane over stunning mountains, lakes and fjords to the port of Cordova, where another CampAlaska van met us. We were delighted that Bill, our guide, remained with us for this leg.</p>
        <p>INACCESSIBLE by road, Cordova is less visited (and much more charming) than either Seward or Valdez. One largely unpaved road, the grandly named Copper River Highway, does lead out of town, but after 48 miles it abruptly terminates in the wilderness. We took that road because it is widely considered the most beautiful drive in Alaska, skirting a half-dozen glaciers, the most spectacular of which is Childs Glacier. Here even Cordovans turn up with their lawn chairs to watch the calving, in which Wal-Mart-size slabs of ice crack off the glacier and explode into the silty but salmon-rich Copper River, causing sizable waves.</p>
        <p>It was along this road, too, that we saw our first beavers, moose, trumpeter swans, willow ptarmigans (the quail-like Alaskan state bird). And a black bear bounded across the road right in front of the van.</p>
        <p>After a second day's hiking the area, we boarded a plane at the minuscule Merle K. (Mudhole) Smith Airport in Cordova for a one-hour flight to Anchorage. Rejuvenated by a night in hotel beds, we rose the next morning for the second half of the camping trip. Now we headed north 235 miles to see Mount McKinley, at 20,320 feet North America's highest peak, and to spend three days at Denali National Park and Preserve.</p>
        <p>With six million acres, Denali has almost as much land as Massachusetts. The group -- we numbered 10 this time -- camped at the nearby Grizzly Bear campsite, which proved aptly named, for on our hikes and daylong Park Service bus tours we saw at least a half dozen grizzlies. The bears were usually at a distance of a quarter-mile, encounters quite close enough for me. Caribou, however, ambled right across our path.</p>
        <p>My wife and I later spent two hours on a white-water rafting trip ($55), offered by the Denali Outdoor Center, through a canyon on the glacial Nenana River, which disorientingly runs south to north. Shooting through Class III and IV rapids (on a scale of I to VI, with the latter being unnegotiable), with such endearing names as Train Wreck, Razorback, Royal Flush and Ice Worm, this novice paddler was hurled once into the center of the raft, but not into the 45-degree water. Our reward at dinner was Bill's Alaskan king crab legs.</p>
        <p>Impressive as Denali was, the highlight of the trip was our three days at the much larger (13.2 million acres) Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve. Six times the size of Yellowstone, Wrangell-St. Elias is chiefly wilderness. The Wrangell Mountain Range is snowcapped and volcanic, and Mount St. Elias (18,008 feet) is the second highest peak in North America. Many of the mountains in both ranges remain not only unclimbed, but unnamed.</p>
        <p>The park itself is penetrated, but only slightly, by two gravel roads. Its ''urban center'' is McCarthy, which has a year-round population of about 30 and is reachable only by air or by a footbridge across the furious Kennicott River. We left the van at the footbridge and carried personal gear across for two nights at the rustic McCarthy Lodge. The remains of the town, which earlier this century entertained hundreds of miners from the adjacent copper mine with saloons and brothels, have a discarded and forlorn air. Melancholy, too, is the 14-story Kennecott mine and mill, which was abruptly shut just before World War II. But our hikes in the spruce and birch forests, full of alpine aster, lupine, berry shrubs and fireweed, were exhilarating, as was a four-hour glacier walk led by St. Elias Alpine Guides, which is headed by Bob Jacobs, a veteran of Everest and polar expeditions. While on the glacier we came across a moulin -- a corkscrew opening in the translucent blue ice -- carved by a melting water channel.</p>
        <p>One last night on our way back to Anchorage was devoted to tenting at  Lake Louise, where we spotted a solitary loon on the placid water. As I saw how adept we were at setting up our tents, I realized I had become a happy Alaskan camper.</p>
