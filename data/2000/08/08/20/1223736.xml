        <p>LONG REMEMBER, by MacKinlay Kantor. (Forge/Tom Doherty, $14.95.) In this Civil War novel, Kantor (at right) tells the story of a man who tries to live as a pacifist in, of all places, Gettysburg, Pa., but is inexorably drawn into the fighting. This is ''a very fine book,'' Peter Monro Jack wrote here in 1934, ''a novel that tastes and smells of war.'' The war's Washington front is examined in ABRAHAM LINCOLN: A Press Portrait, edited by Herbert Mitgang (Fordham University, $19.95). The anthology, with a new introduction, draws on more than 100 newspapers and periodicals from the United States and Europe. Lincoln was a devoted reader of newspapers at a time when they had little pretense of objectivity. The passages ''illuminate as only contemporary writings can,'' Gerald Carson said in these pages in 1971.</p>
        <p>HEARTS IN ATLANTIS, by Stephen King. (Pocket Books, $7.99.) This sprawling work -- two novellas, two stories and an epilogue -- is permeated by Vietnam and the survivor guilt among those who did not go. ''We know now what Stephen King, the master of horror, is afraid of,'' Caleb Crain wrote here last year, even though, he added, the war itself ''remains offstage.''</p>
        <p>TIME, LOVE, MEMORY: A Great Biologist and His Quest for the Origins of Behavior, by Jonathan Weiner. (Vintage, $14.) From his study of the humble fruit fly, Seymour Benzer has achieved great insights into the connections between DNA and behavior, both insect and human. This is ''a lovely book about a lovely scientist'' and ''a wonderful description of biologists at work together,'' Lewis Wolpert said in the Book Review last year.</p>
        <p>EMPIRE EXPRESS: Building the First Transcontinental Railroad, by David Haward Bain. (Penguin, $18.) The legendary golden spike was an ordinary iron one, according to this definitive history. From the drawing rooms of magnates like Leland Stanford to the ''hell on wheels'' where laborers binged, Bain brings an epic project to life. ''The building of the Pacific railroad,'' Robert M. Utley said here last year, has never been recounted ''so thoroughly, authoritatively and engagingly.''</p>
        <p>NOTHING BUT THE NIGHT, by Bill Pronzini. (Walker, $8.95.) In this noir suspense thriller set in Northern California, two men are caught together in raging flood waters. One is a vintner tormented by a childhood horror; the other is a trucker obsessed with finding the hit-and-run driver who left his wife in a coma. ''It's a dark and twisty road to the big smashup,'' Marilyn Stasio wrote in these pages in 1999, ''but these characters travel well.''</p>
        <p>SISTER WOLF, by Ann Arensberg. (Ballantine, $14.) A daughter of a noble Hungarian family lives alone on 1,000 acres in the Berkshires, which she has turned into a sanctuary for wild animals. ''This is a first novel of striking originality,'' Ella Leffland wrote in the Book Review in 1980, calling it ''crisp, urbane, alive with wit.''</p>
        <p>THE PRODUCTIVE EDGE: A New Strategy for Economic Growth, by Richard K. Lester. (Norton, $16.95.) America's standard of living depends on authentic gains in productivity, and the nation has much more to do to get its economy back on track, according to this analysis by a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The book is ''a necessary corrective to all this economic triumphalism,'' Jeff Madrick said here in 1998, praising its ''cogent ideas.''</p>
        <p>I COULD TELL YOU STORIES: Sojourns in the Land of Memory, by Patricia Hampl. (Norton, $13.) This collection of essays explores the art of memoir, as the author moves back and forth between a series of recollections and accounts of reading others' memoirs. Writing in the Book Review in 1999, Linda Simon called Hampl's prose ''rich and idiosyncratic.''</p>
        <p>BOY IN THE WATER, by Stephen Dobyns. (St. Martin's, $6.99.) In Dobyns's 20th novel, the headmaster of a failing New Hampshire boarding school investigates a murder on campus. ''His prose is fluent and the plot races along like clockwork,'' Erik Burns said in these pages last year.</p>
        <p>LIFE THE MOVIE: How Entertainment Conquered Reality, by Neal Gabler. (Vintage, $14.) A cultural critic sees events like the O. J. Simpson trial and the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, as national obsessions that overshadow ideas and ideology. Gabler ''has a fine old time showing how entertainment values have come to permeate every nook and cranny of American life,'' Peter Biskind said here last year. ''It is impossible to put down this book unconvinced of the cataclysmic effect of celebrity on every area of American life.''</p>
