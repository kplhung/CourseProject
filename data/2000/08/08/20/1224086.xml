        <p>The Russian submarine disaster in the Barents Sea has been more than a human tragedy. It has also been a test of the true character of President Vladimir Putin and his senior military. Judging just by their arrogant public handling of the crisis in its first days, he and his commanders have again confirmed the worst.</p>
        <p>As the news first unfolded, the commanders issued conflicting accounts of the sinking of the Kursk submarine, and for days Mr. Putin issued no statement at all. Although we still don't know the details of what caused the disaster, we do know enough about the context to speculate about the larger implications.</p>
        <p>The rundown state of the Russian military is no surprise. For years there have been revelations about suicides in the military ranks, cruel abuses of first-year conscripts and corruption in the senior officer corps. The Committee of Russian Soldiers' Mothers bravely collects and publishes such information in the face of the military's hostility. At the same time, generals and admirals complain that Russian youths are insufficiently patriotic and that the defense budget is too low. As officers skim off money for personal gain, unit training and weapons maintenance as well as procurement of new arms are woefully neglected. Not only are most of the ships in poor repair, but many sailors and junior officers have rarely or maybe never been at sea.</p>
        <p>Why then did the admirals risk launching a large, complex naval exercise in the Barents Sea?</p>
        <p>The answer may lie in the Russian navy's competition with the land-based nuclear strategic forces for scarce resources. The power struggle began as a result of Boris Yeltsin's half-hearted effort to reform the military.</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Yeltsin, it was a two-sided fight between the strategic nuclear forces and the conventional ground forces over who controls all the services and over budget priorities. Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev  had the advantage under Mr. Yeltsin. He created an independent command for the land-based nuclear rockets, bought new long-range ballistic missiles and cut the conventional forces. More recently, the chief of the general staff, Anatoli Kvashnin, a commander in the first war in Chechnya, seemed to be making a comeback for the conventional forces.</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Putin, however, the struggle has become three-sided. Inspired by his rhetoric about being a world-class naval power, the admirals insist that their missile-equipped submarines, rather than the land-based rocket forces, should be Russia's main nuclear deterrent.</p>
        <p>In late July, the quarrel between Marshal Sergeyev and General Kvashnin became conspicuously  public. Mr. Putin let them abuse each other in the media for several days before a security council meeting on Aug. 11 when he reportedly imposed a compromise between the nuclear rocket forces and the conventional forces.</p>
        <p>Then word leaked out that he had given the navy an edge over the land-based rockets, which would be reduced and eventually folded into the air forces. The large exercise in the Barents Sea is likely related to the infighting. Ready or not, the commanders of submarines and ships may have been determined to demonstrate their capabilities to reassure Mr. Putin.</p>
        <p>This interservice strife is largely of Mr. Putin's making. Last November he began talking about the navy's role in reviving Russia as a great power, and in recent remarks to naval personnel in Kaliningrad, he repeated that line. Mr. Putin has also sought to reassure the ground forces, beginning in the spring of 1999 with his support of its plans for an invasion of Chechnya. As the war boosted his popularity in the presidential race, he promised more money to the ground forces.</p>
        <p>Although the costs of the war in Chechnya greatly exceeded expectations, the president continued his rhetoric about Russia's great-power status. Encouraging the expectations of both the admirals and the ground-forces generals, he also signed the new national security doctrine that appeared to give priority to the strategic rocket forces.</p>
        <p>Little wonder the generals and admirals have been ebullient about Mr. Putin. They were unable to avoid the huge cuts in the Gorbachev and Yeltsin eras, and for nearly 15 years, they have hoped that eventually the military would again take first place in devouring the state budget.</p>
        <p>The question is whether Mr. Putin can provide money as well as the moral support. Russia's regional governors are already warning him that he cannot use their tax money for that purpose. Alternatively, he might purge scores of senior officers, as opposed to a token few, and make the military live within the state's means. This seems unlikely. How is he to assert control over the regions, collect more taxes, and break the influence of the oligarchs without military support?</p>
        <p>Moreover, his popularity is now at stake. Although most Russians want him to reduce crime and cut corruption, soldiers' mothers, fathers and wives do not share his affection for the military and secret police. The tragedy of the Kursk and Mr. Putin's brazen reaction to it are bound to reinforce their dislike of the military and may also hurt his highly favorable public opinion ratings.</p>
        <p>Whatever the technical causes of the sinking of the Kursk, the event confronts Mr. Putin with a political crisis. His allies in the military clearly helped him come to power, and this leaves the Russian president with some very difficult choices.</p>
