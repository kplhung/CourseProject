        <p>Members of an advisory board investigating pollution at Fort Totten are clashing over the board's operations. It is unclear if the dispute will affect the decision whether to clean up a portion of the fort grounds.</p>
        <p>Richard Jannacio, the community co-chairman of the board, has asked David Brouwer, his co-chairman from the Army Corps of Engineers, to resign. Mr. Brouwer has refused.</p>
        <p>In a letter, Mr. Jannacio charged that Mr. Brouwer's plan to ''revitalize'' the board, which is composed of local residents, Army Corps members and state officials, was no more than ''an obvious attempt to turn'' the board into ''another rubber stamp for the Army.'' He said that if the plan continued, he expected that he and other members who had criticized the Army Corps's research methods would be removed.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Brouwer countered that the plan sought simply to get more residents to attend board meetings. ''If there is not sufficient interest in the community,'' he said, ''we all have better things that we could be doing with our time.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Brouwer said he had hired a private firm at $40,000 a year to set up a committee to recruit and select members for a new board. Last week, the firm asked current members if they would like to apply to the committee to remain on the board.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Jannacio said such money and effort would be better spent on research into the contamination.</p>
        <p>In 1998, the Corps found mercury and carcinogenic chemicals on the grounds of a 10-acre portion of the base, in sediment in Little Bay and in the tissue of local fish and crustaceans. This summer, they are conducting a more rigorous study of the level of the contaminants.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jannacio said he asked the Corps to hire a firm to independently verify the results of the current study. He said Mr. Brouwer refused. But Mr. Brouwer said state researchers were already making a separate study. ''They will be verifying samples gathered by our contractors,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Riding on the results is the Army's decision whether a cleanup is warranted. Mr. Brouwer said he expected to make his recommendation in January.</p>
