        <p>BECAUSE of increasing demand from its corporate clients, one of the country's leading suppliers of temporary executive housing has tripled its presence in Westchester by leasing 44 apartments in a condominium complex near the Metro-North train station here.</p>
        <p>The one-  and two-bedroom apartments,  at 21 Lake Street about a 10-minute walk to the station, are part of the 71-unit Parkview Condominium complex.

''We like to have housing within easy access of transportation and within walking distance to other services.''</p>

        <p>BECAUSE of increasing demand from its corporate clients, one of the country's leading suppliers of temporary executive housing has tripled its presence in Westchester by leasing 44 apartments in a condominium complex near the Metro-North train station here.</p>
        <p>The one-  and two-bedroom apartments,  at 21 Lake Street about a 10-minute walk to the station, are part of the 71-unit Parkview Condominium complex. ''They fit all our criteria,'' said David Lorenzo, a vice president of the Execustay Corporation by Marriott. ''We like to have housing within easy access of transportation and within walking distance to other services.''</p>
        <p>Execustay will be leasing the block of apartments from Pine Equity, Inc., a real estate investment firm based in Manhattan, which is acquiring them from Amuram Realty of White Plains, which developed the property 12 years ago. Amuram had been renting out the apartments on a short-term basis. ''Then we stepped in and agreed to buy the whole block,'' Mr. Trionfo said.</p>
        <p>The terms of the sale were not disclosed, but Execustay said it has agreed to lease the apartments for 15 years. ''That's a long time for us,'' Mr. Lorenzo said. ''Most of our leases can be anywhere from one to 10 years.''</p>
        <p>While the concept of corporate housing -- leasing apartments to corporate clients for 30 days or longer -- has been a staple of Manhattan's real estate market for years, it is a relatively recent and still rare phenomenon in Westchester.</p>
        <p>''Lately, we've gotten more requests for space in Westchester,'' Mr. Lorenzo said. ''The inquiries are coming both from companies that are located in Westchester and also from Manhattan firms, whose executives don't mind working in the city for a couple of months but want to live in a suburban setting.''</p>
        <p>Prior to this transaction, Execustay had a limited presence in the county, Mr. Lorenzo said, ''about 20 apartments scattered over all.'' He added, ''This is the first time we've taken a block of apartments.''</p>
        <p>While most of the company's New York apartments are in Manhattan, ''more and more, we're looking at the surrounding markets,'' he said. The company recently completed a deal in Great Neck on Long Island, Mr. Lorenzo said, and is now looking for more properties in Westchester.</p>
        <p>The problem in suburbia is that choice is limited, Mr. Lorenzo said. ''We really have to focus on rentals and condominiums, which are in short supply in many suburban markets,'' he said.</p>
        <p>THE condominium inventory is extremely low in Westchester, according to P. Gilbert Mercurio, executive vice president of the Westchester County Board of Realtors. According to the board's second-quarter report, there were 280 condominiums on the market at the end of June, down 40 percent from a year ago. ''A condominium inventory of that size is too low even to register,'' Mr. Mercurio said.</p>
        <p>Much of what is available falls short of Execustay's standards, Mr. Lorenzo said. Co-ops are not included since most co-op buildings do not allow shareholders to lease out their apartments, especially when the co-op market is healthy, said Linda Roth, branch manager for Houlihan/Lawrence's White Plains office.</p>
        <p>''Co-op boards are less likely to allow rentals now that owners will have no trouble selling their unit,'' Ms. Roth said. ''Even condominiums sometimes refuse to allow residents to lease for less than six months, so that makes the situation even harder.''</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Execustay and Pine Equity are planning additional ventures outside White Plains, one on Long Island and another in Philadelphia. Pine Equity acts as a developer and builder as well as an investor in these projects.</p>
        <p>In White Plains, Pine Equity has agreed to get the apartments ready for the corporate market by renovating the lobby and hallways, and creating a fitness center. ''Nothing dramatic, just sprucing up what's there,'' said Ofer Resless, president of Pine Equity. ''We're not really changing anything, just making improvements that will benefit the whole complex.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lorenzo said that Execustay had ''a uniformity in what we offer, which is basically one-  and two-bedroom fully furnished apartments, with washer/dryers, wall-to-wall carpeting. Parking is included, as is all utilities and local telephone.'' The company also provides weekly maid service, television, VCR's, appliances and concierge services -- ''everything down to the linens and the knives and forks in the kitchen,'' he added.</p>
        <p>In White Plains, one-bedroom apartments will cost around $135 a day and two bedrooms less than $200. ''That's about one-half the cost of hotel room for triple the square footage,'' Mr. Lorenzo said.</p>
        <p>At Prudential Rand Realty, in White Plains, which brokered the Execustay deal, requests for temporary corporate housing come in frequently, said Arlyne Ashkinos, a regional vice president. ''We get four or five referrals a week, and we just don't have the product to meet the demand. Now we're referring people to the extended-stay hotels, but that can get pretty expensive for stays over one month.''</p>
        <p>The demand for corporate housing in Manhattan is such that developers of rental and condominium projects are now setting whole blocks of apartments aside for its use. While several new rental projects have been built in Westchester in recent years, so far none have dedicated corporate housing components.</p>
        <p>A T the leasing stage, we have rented a few apartments here and there to corporate users but not a whole lot,'' said Frederick S. Harris, a vice president with AvalonBay Communities, in Alexandria, Va., one of the most active builders of rental housing in the county. ''But it's a growing market and we'd be very open to it.''</p>
        <p>Execustay was acquired by Marriott International Inc. for $114.5 million in March 1999. Since then, the company has grown to more than 6,000 apartments and increased revenues to $165 million by the end last year. The New York division has doubled its inventory of apartments, Mr. Lorenzo said, ''and we're expanding into Westchester, Long Island and New Jersey.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lorenzo explained that with Execustay,  Marriott was now set up to handle stays of almost any length for its customers. ''Those who need a few days' stay can use Courtyard at Marriott's hotel chain,'' he said, ''for a few weeks a Residence Inn, an extended-stay hotel chain, and now Execustay  for accommodations of over one month.''</p>
        <p>''Our business has really increased due to referrals from other Marriott products,'' Mr. Lorenzo added. ''That's really made a huge difference. We're getting better about getting the word out about corporate housing, but the truth is a lot of people still don't know about it.''</p>
