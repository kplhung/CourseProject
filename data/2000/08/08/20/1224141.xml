        <p>Vice President Al Gore assailed Gov. George W. Bush of Texas today as a man who has embraced the interests of corporations at the expense of the middle class.</p>
        <p>In a fiery speech he delivered here on the banks of the Mississippi River, Mr. Gore placed Mr. Bush squarely on the side of pharmaceutical companies that he said gouge the elderly with high drug prices, insurance company ''bean counters'' who overrule doctors and major polluters who cut corners on environmental protection measures for the sake of profits.</p>
        <p>''They're for the powerful, we're for the people,'' Mr. Gore said before embarking on the second day of a journey down the Mississippi aboard the Mark Twain riverboat.</p>
        <p>Positioning himself as a populist champion, Mr. Gore promised the elderly new Medicare benefits to help pay for prescription drugs. ''My opponent won't,'' he shouted. ''They give in to the big drug companies; I fight for families.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore promised to give doctors more authority over medical decisions. ''My opponent won't,'' he said. ''They give in to the big insurance companies that don't want that.''</p>
        <p>He also said he would take on  polluters who ''cut corners'' for profits. ''My opponent does not reflect that commitment in what's been going on in his home state,'' Mr. Gore said, a reference to Texas' low ranking in air and water quality.</p>
        <p>''When we look to the future,'' he said, ''it makes a difference if you have someone in the Oval Office who is willing to stand up to the oil companies and the big polluters and say the families of this country deserve better.''</p>
        <p>The Bush campaign was quick to respond. ''It seems like a lot of finger-pointing from an administration that has failed to act on these issues,'' said Mindy Tucker, a spokeswoman for Mr. Bush. ''In contrast, Governor Bush has signed into law a patients' bill of rights for Texans. He has reduced toxic releases more than all other 49 states combined and he supports reforming Medicare to include a prescription drug benefit for seniors.''</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Gore delivered one of his clearest and most concise critiques of Mr. Bush. For weeks, Mr. Gore had been somewhat circumspect in his criticism of Mr. Bush. At an event in Cleveland before the Democratic convention, for example, Mr. Gore passed up the invitation to criticize Mr. Bush's record on health care. He has left it to others to tear into Mr. Bush's record, perhaps mindful that many voters are turned off by harsh attacks.</p>
        <p>But with some polls showing him at last pulling even, or nudging ahead of Mr. Bush, Mr. Gore appeared emboldened today to challenge Mr. Bush with renewed directness and vigor. And many in today's crowd of several thousand, dominated by teachers and union workers, delighted in the attacks, waving signs and chanting ''Go, Al, go.''</p>
        <p>On Friday, Mr. Bush accused Mr. Gore of engaging in class warfare, and the Bush campaign has argued that Mr. Gore -- the son of a senator, the product of elite private schools and ferociously good at raising money from corporations -- hardly fits the role of working-class hero. Much of the Gore family's wealth comes from holdings in the Occidental Petroleum Corporation, whose founder, Armand Hammer, was a close friend of Mr. Gore's father.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, is a baker's son, but some of his most reliable contributors have worked in  the insurance and pharmaceutical industries. In this year's Senate campaign, Mr. Lieberman, who according to Connecticut law is allowed to campaign to keep his Senate seat while also running as the vice presidential nominee, has collected more money from the insurance industry -- $197,419 -- than any other senator, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. He has raised $91,150 from the pharmaceutical industry, second only to Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah. Mr. Lieberman's wife, Hadassah, was once director of policy planning and communications for Pfizer Inc., one of the nation's largest drug companies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's press secretary, Chris Lehane, played down the importance of those contributions and Mr. Lieberman's efforts on behalf of both industries. ''Who's running for president?'' Mr. Lehane asked. ''Al Gore's at the top of the ticket.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. Gore and his aides have only stepped up their populist rhetoric. ''It's really clear what's going on,'' Mr. Lehane said. ''George W. Bush is in the hip pocket of big oil, the prescription drug companies and the big insurance companies.''</p>
