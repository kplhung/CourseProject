        <p>He has been notably absent from major track and field competitions for more than a year, and he was notably absent from tonight's premeet parade of stars during which the likes of Maurice Greene and Gail Devers took a lap on the track at the Louis II Stadium in classic convertible cars.</p>
        <p>But Javier Sotomayor, a former and perhaps future Olympic champion, finally did make an appearance, pulling on his spikes and his wraparound sunglasses in the humid evening air of the Cote d'Azur, and smiling through the mixture of boos, whistles and cheers that greeted the announcement of his name in tonight's lineup of high jumpers.</p>
        <p>Two hours later, Sotomayor heard more mixed reviews from the crowd as he stood on the podium after winning his event at the Golden League meet in Monaco by clearing 2.30 meters (7 feet 6 inches).</p>
        <p>Sotomayor and Cuban track officials may have been able to persuade the International Amateur Athletic Federation to reduce his suspension for testing positive for cocaine from two years to one year. But from the sound of it tonight, some track fans still need to be convinced that Sotomayor, who won the gold medal in the 1992 Olympics, should be allowed back among the pack of Olympic hopefuls who are clearing bars at big-money, one-night meets in hopes of reaching their peaks next month in Sydney, Australia.</p>
        <p>''I think Javier has a really good chance of winning another gold,'' said Alberto Juantorena, the president of the Cuban track and field federation, who successfully pleaded Sotomayor's case here in front of the I.A.A.F. council on Aug. 2.</p>
        <p>''I was not fantastic today,'' Sotomayor told French television. ''I was very tired because I have been practicing a lot, and I also have a new baby since July, which is another reason why I'm a little tired. But I should be able to clear 2.36 or 2.37 at the Olympics. I just hope nobody else does 2.40.''</p>
        <p>Sotomayor, who set the world record of 2.45 meters (8 feet) in 1993, tested positive for cocaine during last year's Pan American Games and was stripped of the gold medal he had already won. Sotomayor denied ever using cocaine and was cleared by the Cuban federation, which maintained that the second of his two urine samples might have been tampered with.</p>
        <p>After months of legal wrangling and hearings, an I.A.A.F. arbitration panel upheld the two-year ban on June 27, which meant that Sotomayor was ineligible to compete until July 30, 2001. But the Cuban federation pursued his case under a clause in the I.A.A.F. rulebook that allows drug bans to be modified under exceptional circumstances. The I.A.A.F., citing the hundreds of drug tests the 32-year-old had passed during his career, cut Sotomayor's penalty in half on Aug. 2.</p>
        <p>Sotomayor returned to competition on Tuesday in a minor meet in Montauban, France, and won with a leap of 2.28 meters, the minimum established by the Cuban federation for Olympic selection. But tonight was his return to his sport's first division, and his victims included Charles Austin, the reigning Olympic champion, and Nathan Leeper, both of the United States.</p>
        <p>Other Americans fared better.  Greene won the men's 100 meters over a relatively weak field in the unspectacular time of 10.01 seconds. Inger Miller won the women's 100 in 10.91, her best time of the season, and later helped the women's 4x100 relay team warm up for Sydney by beating teams from the Bahamas and France in a season-best time of 42.13 seconds. Devers, also part of the relay tonight, remained undefeated in the 100 hurdles this season, winning in 12.54 seconds after what she called ''a technically poor performance.''</p>
        <p>The most impressive run of the night came from Ali Saidi-Sief, the emerging Algerian middle-distance star who set a national record and meet record by wining the men's 3,000 in 7 minutes 25.02 seconds. Cathy Freeman, the Australian who will be a focus of attention in Sydney, also ran the season's fastest women's 400, winning in 49.48 seconds, and Irina Privalova, a former European champion in the 200 who has switched to the 400 hurdles, surprised the American champion Sandra Glover-Cummings to win in 54.06 seconds.</p>
