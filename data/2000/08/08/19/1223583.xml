        <p>The secretary of the interior said today that the wildfires raging across the West were likely to get worse and warned that with resources already stretched to the limit, little could be done to slow their progress.</p>
        <p>More than one million acres were burning today in 11 Western states, the most land on fire at any time in the United States since 1910. Federal officials said today that they were growing increasingly concerned that the situation in Montana, the state hardest hit, might turn more catastrophic, with separate fires beginning to merge.</p>
        <p>The interior secretary, Bruce Babbitt, who spent the day traversing the smoky skies and walking the soot-covered soil, said the scope of the fires and the limited availability of trained firefighting supervisors meant that the intensity of the blazes in the weeks ahead would depend more on weather than anything else.</p>
        <p>''Additional bodies will not help in this fire season,'' Mr. Babbitt said on a stop here, where he met with some of the 25,000 people battling the fires from Montana to New Mexico.</p>
        <p>Mr. Babbitt seemed to be trying in part to head off public calls for the  deployment of more firefighters, a step that he warned might be counterproductive. But his comments today seemed also to underscore a sense of powerlessness in a fire season that was on track to become the most devastating in 90 years.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration has been criticized for its slow response to the fires and for its conservation policies, which critics say have contributed to the extensive damage.  Representatives of the timber industry have said the priority given to environmental concerns has prevented officials from confronting the fire threat through emergency logging.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to be an alarmist, and I'm not saying it will become catastrophic,'' Mr. Babbitt said. ''But the probability that it will become worse is very high.''</p>
        <p>Of most immediate concern, a federal fire official with Mr. Babbitt said, is what could happen over the next few days, when high winds are expected across Montana and Idaho.</p>
        <p>The official, Larry E. Hamilton, director of the National Office of Fire and Aviation in Boise, Idaho, said the winds could consolidate scattered fires, posing new dangers to communities like those in Montana's Bitterroot Valley, south of Missoula, whose residents have already been evacuated twice.</p>
        <p>''What you could have in some places is a 20- to 40-mile wall of flame, and that would be just unstoppable,'' Mr. Hamilton said.</p>
        <p>So far this year, wildfires have consumed 4.7 million acres, including the more than 1 million acres still burning. Mr. Hamilton said there was a chance that the total by the end of the season could top the more than 8 million acres burned in 1910.</p>
        <p>Of the 85 major fires burning across the West, 27 are in Montana, with more than 470,000 acres burned or burning.</p>
        <p>To reinforce the hundreds of fire crews, the federal government has  turned to the military, which has deployed about 2,000 troops, and to other countries, including Canada, Australia and New Zealand, which have sent some 600 firefighters.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Babbitt said a shortage of supervisors meant that to deploy more firefighters risked putting untrained volunteers in harm's way.</p>
        <p>''There's a point of diminishing returns, and actually, diminishing loss of effectiveness when you start piling people in without trained leadership to manage them,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In response to the fires, Montana's governor, Marc Racicot, imposed a state of emergency on Wednesday and called up the National Guard to assist in firefighting efforts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Babbitt said he believed that such reinforcements would be best used to help in evacuations, if necessary, rather than on the fire lines.</p>
        <p>About 25 percent of those people battling the fires are college students, and with a new semester about to begin, Mr. Babbitt said he was concerned that many firefighters might return to school.</p>
        <p>In hopes of preventing such a drain, he said he had spent much of the last few days pressing Western governors to defer registration deadlines in public universities until at least Sept. 15, so firefighters could stay on the job. Montana and Idaho have already announced such plans.</p>
        <p>''These are people who are already trained up and on the ground, and we don't want to lose them,'' Mr. Babbitt said.</p>
        <p>On a day that began with a briefing at the interagency fire center, Mr. Babbitt flew to Montana and then Wyoming on a route that covered some of the worst fires.</p>
        <p>For much of the trip, the view was obscured by smoke, but some fires could be readily identified, including one that broke out late Thursday in the small town of Atlanta, Idaho, northeast of Boise, and forced the evacuation of about 100 people.</p>
        <p>A trained firefighter, with many summers' experience on the lines, Mr. Babbitt pointed out the line of the fire's advance, driven by winds that had tossed embers long distances.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hamilton said the concerns about the spread of the fires had intensified in the last week, in part because of analysis from experts at a Forest Service research station in Missoula, Mont. A computer model that assessed such factors as drought, lightning strikes and fuel loads had concluded that there was at least a 10 percent chance that the fires could force large-scale evacuations.</p>
