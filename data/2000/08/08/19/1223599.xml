        <p>With most of the arrangements for their wedding taken care of and their honeymoon to Bali all set, Peter Seligman and his fiancee set off yesterday morning on one last crucial errand: to get a marriage license.

        <p>With most of the arrangements for their wedding taken care of and their honeymoon to Bali all set, Peter Seligman and his fiancee set off yesterday morning on one last crucial errand: to get a marriage license. They left their East Side apartment before 8 a.m. and boarded a No. 5 train, heading downtown toward the marriage license bureau in the Municipal Building.</p>
        <p>A few moments before the train pulled into the Brooklyn Bridge station, Mr. Seligman, a 30-year-old partner at a major public relations company, felt dizzy; he and his fiancee, Sara Sinek, stepped out between the subway cars so he could get some air, the police said.</p>
        <p>Then, in a single, surreal moment,  Mr. Seligman fainted, tumbled onto the subway tracks and was killed, electrocuted by the third rail, the police said.</p>
        <p>He was pronounced dead at New York University Downtown Hospital at 9:50 a.m.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sinek, who is a manager of public relations at Scholastic Inc., the children's publisher, had told her supervisor that she would be late to work yesterday because she was going to get the marriage license.</p>
        <p>The wedding had been scheduled for 7 p.m. on Sept. 3 at Chelsea Piers in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>At the Scholastic office, the excitement had been growing as Ms. Sinek and her colleagues discussed the upcoming wedding. Her supervisor, Judy Corman, said, ''Every day it was another event.''</p>
        <p>''They were a divine, wonderful, darling, very in love and very smart couple,'' she said. ''This is all very sad, very devastating.''</p>
        <p>The couple had met at Dan Klores Associates, where Mr. Seligman represented the comedian Jay Leno, the boxer Mike Tyson and several other high profile sports and entertainment figures. According to a wedding announcement that was submitted to The New York Times, Ms. Sinek was Mr. Seligman's assistant at the publicity company for a year before the two struck up a romance in 1998, after bumping into each other in Southampton.</p>
        <p>Their families declined to comment yesterday, but Mr. Klores, the president of the public relations company, said Mr. Seligman's friends and colleagues were in a state of shock. He added that he spent last Saturday night with the couple at his summer home on Long Island.</p>
        <p>''There is no explanation for such a thing,'' he said. ''Peter was a young man of great decency who possessed an incredible work ethic. He had his entire life, a life filled with love and continued success in front of him.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Klores said he hired Mr. Seligman eight years ago, shortly after the young man had graduated from the University of Wisconsin and a year after Mr. Klores had started the company. In 1997, he made Mr. Seligman, then only 27, a partner.</p>
        <p>Friends said Mr. Seligman, who grew up in Harrison, N.Y., was close to Mr. Leno and was known for his imitations of the comedian. Mr. Leno's office said yesterday that he did not want to discuss Mr. Seligman's death publicly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Klores described Mr. Seligman as a sports fanatic who worked and traveled constantly for his job, which involved supervising 20 people.</p>
        <p>''He was very serious-minded about his work,'' Mr. Klores said. ''He took everything to heart, good and bad. He was loyal to his people and he was loyal to me.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Klores said Mr. Seligman's funeral was planned for tomorrow.</p>
