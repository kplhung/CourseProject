        <p>For Democrats this week, a flood of nostalgia evoked a bygone time in politics when Lew Wasserman, head of the MCA studios, Frank Sinatra and other figures in the old Hollywood establishment hobnobbed at the 1960 convention with John F. Kennedy. Back then, the entertainment industry supplied the glamour for a political party trying to look hip and committed. But the real power in Los Angeles resided elsewhere.</p>
        <p>The convention this week showed how the entertainment industry has moved from the gilt-edged periphery of the Democratic Party to its financial and cultural center. For Los Angeles that transition has come with a striking geographical twist. Forty years ago the power center was downtown. This Democratic convention, though it took place downtown, reflected how much the center of power has shifted to the city's west side, where the entertainment and fashion industries are rooted.</p>
        <p>Though Ronald Reagan was a son of Hollywood, he had no interest in engineering such a transition when he ran for president in 1980. Mr. Reagan's financial backers were not from show business, but from the other Los Angeles business establishment -- men like Justin Dart,  Holmes Tuttle, Henry Salvatori and Alfred Bloomingdale. Many of them had recruited Mr. Reagan earlier to run for governor after making fortunes in the oil, aerospace and real estate industries.</p>
        <p>At the 1960 convention the new and largely Jewish Democratic political establishment on the west side and the San Fernando Valley was beginning to hit its stride. But it was a time when Jews, blacks and other minorities were still excluded from the California Club, the Jonathan Club, the Los Angeles Country Club and other precincts where Los Angeles's movers and shakers virtually ran the town. Indeed the downtown and west side establishments when I was growing up there hardly even knew each other.</p>
        <p>In his book ''The Powers That Be,'' David Halberstam spoke of the time in the 1960's when Dorothy Chandler, doyenne of the family that owned The Los Angeles Times, then a conservative Republican paper that Jews looked on with disapproval,  tried to bridge the gap between downtown and west Los Angeles. She realized that to raise money to save the old Hollywood Bowl and build a new music center, she had to go where the money was, to men like Mr. Wasserman of MCA and to Paul Ziffren, the top lawyer in west Los Angeles and a stalwart of the Democratic Party. Mrs. Chandler, Mr. Halberstam wrote, ''knew what was happening in the world of the arts, and there the changes were taking place much faster than they did in the world of the California Club.''</p>
        <p>The coming together of new and old money occurred so fast that by the 1980's, when the Reagan team reached its zenith of power in the nation, the old guard was becoming increasingly irrelevant in its own home town. Mayor Tom Bradley, an African-American, had put together his own coalition of minorities, Jews and moderate business leaders. He barred city officials from attending  meetings in the California Club and even got an ordinance passed banning discrimination in any private club where business was conducted. Mayor Richard Riordan, a Republican, has kept the Bradley coalition going and tried to expand it.</p>
        <p>Today the old-line conservative Republican business establishment has largely disappeared from view. Many powerful banks and financial businesses have died or been bought by outsiders, just as The Los Angeles Times has been. The oil and aerospace industries are ailing, and the Mojave Desert to the north of the city, where the stealth bomber was tested and the space shuttle still lands, is now being torn up for residential communities by developers like Eli Broad, the tycoon from the west side who is a close supporter of Mayor Riordan and was instrumental in bringing the Democrats to town this summer.</p>
        <p>The exciting thing about Los Angeles now is the emergence of new elites, most notably in the Asian and Hispanic communities. Instead of being dominated by a handful of wealthy barons, it is a city laced with entrepreneurs striving to reinvent the city. The next mayor could be either Assemblyman Antonio Villaraigosa or Representative Xavier Becerra, two rival leaders of the Hispanic community.</p>
        <p>The new concern in Los Angeles is that it has lost its cohesion and sense of purpose provided by the old elite. Even the entertainment industry has fragmented into dozens of power centers outside the shadow of giants like Mr. Wasserman. Some fear the loss of support of the city's central cultural institutions. Others worry that without a new identity, places like the San Fernando Valley and the harbor district to the south may secede. For anyone fascinated by how the city has changed from 1960 to now, what it will be like in 2020 is anybody's guess.</p>
        <p>''It is certainly a different city today, but you wouldn't expect it to be the same,'' says Betsy Bloomingdale, the widow of one of the pillars of the Reagan inner circle. ''You've got to go forward or you die.''</p>
