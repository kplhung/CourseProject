        <p>Senator John McCain of Arizona said today that he would have surgery on Saturday morning to remove two malignant melanomas that were discovered after a routine skin examination earlier this month.</p>
        <p>The operation will require him to receive general anesthesia and stay overnight at the Mayo Clinic Hospital in north Phoenix, where doctors told Mr. McCain today that treating the melanoma at his left temple would also require a biopsy of his lymph nodes to determine whether the cancer had spread to any internal organs. If that were the case, Mr. McCain's condition would be regarded as far more serious.</p>
        <p>The doctors said the other melanoma, on Mr. McCain's left arm, had been detected early enough to remove it easily with no anticipated consequences.</p>
        <p>But in both cases, doctors told him, the malignant spots were unrelated and separate from any he had treated in the past -- which medical experts consider a positive sign.</p>
        <p>''I'm very confident; the doctors are very confident that we will have this thing done very quickly,'' Mr. McCain said, smiling and sounding upbeat as he and his wife, Cindy, met with reporters outside the couple's house in the north-central section of Phoenix, a short distance from the hospital. ''I've been in a number of fights in my life. This is just another one. I'm sure we will prevail.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain, 63, who abandoned a run for president in March, conceded that there was a chance doctors might find something more serious after conducting tests on the lymph nodes. But he played down any concerns, joking with reporters and predicting that he would return to the campaign trail on behalf of his party's presidential nominee, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, and other Republican candidates by Labor Day.</p>
        <p>''In a short time, I'll be back on the Straight Talk Express,'' he said, referring to the bus rides he led during his campaigning for president, and, after he withdrew, for other candidates. Still, he cautioned, ''The doctors are confident, but you never know.''</p>
        <p>Melanomas can be the deadliest and most aggressive forms of skin cancer.</p>
        <p>Medical experts say people with light skin are much more susceptible to skin cancer than others, and Mr. McCain has been dealing with the condition for years. In 1993, he had a malignant melanoma removed from his shoulder, and ever since has undergone periodic medical examinations to monitor any additional or recurring problems.</p>
        <p>''Everybody thinks the curse of the Irish is alcohol,'' Mr. McCain said. ''It's their fair skin.''</p>
        <p>It was during a routine examination on Aug. 3 that doctors at the Bethesda Naval Medical Center, just outside Washington, found the two melanomas. They recommended further testing, and on Thursday at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, a suburb of Phoenix, Mr. McCain was administered a battery of tests, including blood work, chest X-rays and an electrocardiogram.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. McCain and his wife returned to the clinic to meet with doctors, who discussed the test results and their recommended course of action. Mr. McCain said his doctors would meet with reporters on Saturday after the operation to answer questions.</p>
        <p>In speaking to reporters today, Mr. McCain apologized for news leaks on Wednesday of his latest round of tests. He said he had not intended to say anything until the tests were complete and that he did not know who was responsible for the leaks. He said he was especially sorry for the timing because the leaks came on the day Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut was accepting the nomination to be the Democratic choice for vice president, making him the first Jewish candidate for so high an office.</p>
        <p>Describing Mr. Lieberman as ''a dear friend,'' Mr. McCain said, ''I don't think anything should have detracted from his moment.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain also dispelled the theory that his disposition to skin cancer might have been caused by the five years he spent in a Vietnamese prison camp. He said he was mostly indoors at the time, adding, ''The one thing I wanted to do as a prisoner of war was to see the sun. I went years without seeing the sun.''</p>
        <p>Despite potential problems that further medical tests might suggest, both McCains tried to keep the situation light. As they approached reporters who had been waiting more than an hour in a broiling midday sun, Mrs. McCain carried a basket of sunscreen bottles, and an aide pushed along a wheelbarrow filled with ice and bottles of water.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain used the basket to make a case for constant use of sunscreen and said that early detection of skin problems alleviates many more serious problems.</p>
        <p>Before he and his wife returned to the house, a reporter asked him to clarify a report that the couple had gone to the movies this week. Yes, he said, they saw ''What Lies Beneath.''</p>
        <p>Suddenly realizing the allusion to his medical condition, he laughed and said, ''I should have gone to see 'The Gladiator.' ''</p>
