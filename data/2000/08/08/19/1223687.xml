        <p>LOWY-Irma. Resident of New York City, died in her 90th year at home after a long illness. She is survived by her daughter Ruth Lacey, her son Frank Lowy, and her three grandchildren Alexander, Evan, and Andrew. A camp director for over 20 years, she will be fondly remembered by her campers as Aunt Iwo. She was a kind and generous woman who will be missed by all who knew her. Donations may be made to her favorite charities: The Fresh Air Fund or God's Love We Deliver.</p>
        <p>LOWY-Iwo. Known affectionately as ''Aunt Iwo'' to those of us fortunate to have been at Farm Camp Lowy. She will always be as precious to us as our memories of youth and summer. Nessa and Elizabeth</p>
