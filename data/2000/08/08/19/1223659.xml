        <p>Fox Sports Net announced yesterday that Michael Irvin, the former Dallas Cowboys wide receiver, will not join its NFL This Morning program.</p>
        <p>The decision was made a week after the police in North Dallas, Texas, chose not to charge Irvin after he and a woman were arrested in an apartment where authorities said they found marijuana, ecstasy pills and a substance resembling cocaine.</p>
        <p>The police said they went to the apartment to serve an F.B.I. warrant on the tenant, who was not there. Irvin's lawyer said he was in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>
        <p>After several lengthy conversations between Fox Sports Net and Michael Irvin, a statement from the cable network said, both parties agree that given the events of last week, it would be imprudent for Michael to begin his career as an analyst on 'NFL This Morning' at this time.</p>
        <p>Irvin was hired by F.S.N. last month immediately upon his retirement. The program will proceed with last week's cast: Chris Myers, Marv Levy, Jackie Slater and Chris Spielman.</p>
