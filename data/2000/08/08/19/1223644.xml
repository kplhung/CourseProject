        <p>Near the 18th green, the sign on the scoreboard read, ''37 Golden Years at the P.G.A. Thank you, Bear.'' And now the applause was surrounding that Golden Bear, 60-year-old Jack Nicklaus, as he walked down the fairway on what he would describe later as ''maybe my last hole in a major'' tournament.</p>
        <p>He waved, took his sand wedge and surveyed the 72 uphill yards to the flagstick on the 18th green.</p>
        <p>In the long sundown shadows streaking across the Valhalla Golf Club course that he designed, a voice in the gallery yelled: ''Do it. Do it.'' And as Nicklaus's ball soared high toward the flagstick, several people yelled, ''Go in the hole.'' It almost did, landing above the hole, spinning back and sliding past the cup by about 3 feet for what loomed as a birdie 4 on the 542-yard par-5 hole.</p>
        <p>Even louder cheers erupted now and when Nicklaus, his cap off, walked across the front of the green, Tiger Woods slapped him five.</p>
        <p>Until then, a P.G.A. official had announced the arrival of the golfers at the 18th green, but now that official turned to the crowd and said, ''I think Mr. Nicklaus just introduced himself,'' before introducing Woods and Vijay Singh.</p>
        <p>Moments later, when Woods holed a 15-foot birdie putt, Nicklaus smiled, pointed his right forefinger at the 24-year-old United States Open and British Open champion, then raised his right thumb.</p>
        <p>After Singh putted out, Nicklaus stood over his putt, then knocked it in for his birdie. He embraced his son Steve, who was caddying for him, then walked over and shook hands with Woods, Singh and their caddies.</p>
        <p>''Great birdie, Jack,'' several voices shouted as he moved through the gallery to the scorer's tent. ''Great birdie.''</p>
        <p>And it was. But it wasn't great enough to help him make the 36-hole cut in this 82nd Professional Golfers' Association Championship, a title he won five times in accumulating 18 major titles. He had shot a one-under-par 71, but his two-round total of 148 apparently will miss the cut by at least one stroke when the second round is completed Saturday.</p>
        <p>When he was asked later where that final birdie will rank among his memories, he smiled.</p>
        <p>''It ranks one short of making the cut,'' he said. At 60 he still retained the embers of the competitive fire that earned him the stature of being the best golfer in history -- the golfer who set the standard that Woods aspires to.</p>
        <p>But after having watched Woods shoot 66-67, Nicklaus was as gracious in talking about his heir apparent to the ''best golfer in history'' title as he always was when he finished second in 19 majors. Asked if he had passed the torch to Woods here, he laughed.</p>
        <p>''I think it was handed over long before this,'' Nicklaus said. ''What Tiger is doing right now, he's a better player than I was.''</p>
