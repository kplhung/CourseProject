        <p>DREAMWORLD AND CATASTROPHE  The Passing of Mass Utopia in East and West  By Susan Buck-Morss  M.I.T. Press. 368 pages. $45.</p>
        <p>In 1988, Susan Buck-Morss, a professor of government at Cornell University and an authority on Marxist thought, visited Moscow to meet with a group of Soviet philosophers. She had written a knotty but keen book about Theodor Adorno and the Frankfurt School of philosophy (''The Origin of Negative Dialectics'') and admired the philosopher Walter Benjamin, who himself went on a pilgrimage to Moscow in the 1920's.</p>
        <p>''The fact that I had been schooled in Western Marxism had everything to do with my desire to enter into a collaboration,'' she writes in ''Dreamworld and Catastrophe'' (M.I.T. Press). ''Yet this Marxist orientation,'' she adds with some chagrin, ''was of very little interest to my Moscow counterparts.'' In fact, when she began a lecture by citing Marx, the audience laughed; they thought she was mocking standard ritualistic invocations of Marx and Lenin.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Buck-Morss wasn't intending satire.  In fact, one of her worries in her new, and eccentric, book is that with the fall of the Soviet Union, the great dream of a ''mass utopia'' that marked the 20th century in both East and West -- a dream in which Marx played an important role -- is near extinction. There was nothing wrong with the dream, Ms. Buck-Morss argues,  only its execution went awry, and despite most assumptions it failed in the West as well as the East. Her argument, which sometimes glints with insights but is almost always clouded by distortion, deserves some close attention, for it is exactly the kind of argument that is bound to be heard more often as problems facing the formerly Communist countries mount, as the memories of the Soviet past recede, and as the very notion that totalitarianism even existed comes under increasing challenge.</p>
        <p>Right now, Ms. Buck-Morss suggests, there is a ''hegemonic discourse'' -- a dominant interpretation -- that affirms the moral superiority of the West after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the fall of the Berlin Wall: totalitarianism was evil and democracy virtuous, and virtue emerged victorious. But, Ms. Buck-Morss argues, this is all wrong. The cold war, far from being a battle between radically different societies, was actually a ''story of similarities.'' East and West saw each other as evil and ''refused to face their own failures as democracies.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Buck-Morss's similarities are actually  symmetries. When she talks about the 1920's for example, she outlines the various failures in American ''democracy'' (the ironic quotation marks are hers): the ''red scare'' that brought all protesters under suspicion, the Espionage Act of 1918 making criticism of the military punishable by 20 years' imprisonment,  attacks on aliens, labor unrest. ''The record in the Soviet Union,'' she continues, ''is hardly more heartening.'' There was the violence of the civil war, the quashing of protests and, in the late 20's, Stalin's ''ruthless destruction'' of peasants.</p>
        <p>She acknowledges that the ''body count was incomparably higher'' than in similar events in the West, but even this is an understatement that tries to preserve a symmetry where there is none. Flaws in a democratic nation that could be and generally were corrected by legislative and constitutional process are being compared with the murder and starvation of tens of millions of people in a social engineering experiment that created one of the century's worst horrors.</p>
        <p>This is the pattern of most of Ms. Buck-Morss's symmetries. There are sins of misplaced blame on both sides: after World War II, the Soviets interpreted fascism as a capitalist phenomenon, exonerating East German Communists, while in the West, socialists were slurred by being ''lumped together'' with fascists as totalitarian. There are also sins of violent excess: in the East, the class war led to ''the danger of suffocation'' of liberties; in the West, aggressive territorial ambitions led to ''grotesque''  weapons and ''orgies of annihilation.'' But all these symmetries are weighted to give what Ms. Buck-Morss elsewhere calls ''the benefit of the doubt'' to the East.</p>
        <p>When Ms. Buck-Morss turns her attention to cultural symmetries, it comes as a bit of relief -- even though she tends to view art in the Marxist manner, asserting that the aesthetic experience should teach a political lesson. It is impossible not to be intrigued by the similarities she points out between the 1933 image of King Kong on the Empire State Building and the 1933 plans for a gargantuan Palace of the Soviets topped by a colossal statue of Lenin, or to be reminded of the strange cultural interplay that moved  the designers of the Radio City Music Hall to visit the Soviet Union for ideas, or Soviet planners to seek out the factory designs of Henry Ford.</p>
        <p>Such detail (and some fascinating illustrations) are far more concrete than Ms. Buck-Morss's political arguments. Still, in her world, abstractions rule. And historical judgments have less to do with life as it is lived than with the wish for what it could have been or should still be.</p>
        <p>So it is no wonder that Ms. Buck-Morss caused some dismay among her Soviet colleagues when she kept focusing on the commonalities between East and West. They kept insisting, instead, that there were ''modern horrors'' that were unique to them and that were not being comprehended. The critic Frederic Jameson, who joined Ms. Buck-Morss in a Soviet conference in 1990, even pointed out that the cold war roles now seemed reversed, with Western Marxists criticizing ''capitalist commodity culture,''  while the Soviet philosophers used the vocabulary of ''cold war anti-Communism.''</p>
        <p>This was, of course, because these Western intellectuals knew all the flaws that scar the democratic state, all the weaknesses of democratic culture, all the unkept promises and unmet ideals. They dreamed of a more perfect world. But the Eastern intellectuals may have known something more profound: that in the midst of a world of imperfections and injustices, some distinctions are still worth making.</p>
