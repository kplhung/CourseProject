        <p>Before tonight's exhibition game with the Jets, when Giants Coach Jim Fassel wanted to praise his team's play in the preseason, he talked about how few mistakes the Giants had made.</p>
        <p>In two previous preseason games, the Giants had committed only nine penalties, just six of them by the starters. The first-team offense had not turned the ball over and the offensive line, plagued for years by procedure and holding penalties, had been whistled for just one penalty, a false start.</p>
        <p>But in tonight's 27-24 loss to the Jets, the new-look Giants, now without a victory in the 2000 preseason, flopped in all the old, familiar ways.</p>
        <p>In a sloppy relapse, the Giants' starters doubled their previous preseason penalty total. Overall, the Giants were whistled for 16 penalties for 105 yards, with 11 penalties in the second quarter alone. There were three false starts -- two by offensive linemen -- and two delay-of-game penalties. There were two holding penalties, including one by Howard Cross that negated a good kickoff return.</p>
        <p>As quarterback Kerry Collins said: ''There were times out there when it seemed like we lost our heads.''</p>
        <p>Giants linebacker Mike Barrow likened the team's play to the collection of reserves that will casually mimic the opposition during practice sessions.</p>
        <p>''I felt like we were the scout team out there,'' Barrow said.</p>
        <p>Little wonder Fassel exploded in anger in the team's locker room after the game, lashing into his players in a high-decibel harangue directed toward every quarter of the room.</p>
        <p>''Oh, he lit into us,'' cornerback Jason Sehorn said. ''And we deserved it.''</p>
        <p>To reporters, Fassel called the penalties ''terrible,'' and added: ''They're going to be some guys who get a wakeup call pretty quick.''</p>
        <p>Errors were commonplace from the beginning to the end of tonight's game, with misplays by even the most dependable Giants.</p>
        <p>Running back Tiki Barber fumbled inside the Jets' 5-yard line, ruining the Giants' chances for what would have been a game-tying touchdown late in the first half. Sehorn didn't stay in position on one play and gave up the Jets' first touchdown. Safety Sam Garnes blew another assignment for the Jets' second touchdown.</p>
        <p>And the Giants' pass rush was nonexistent.</p>
        <p>''I don't think we've gotten a pass rush all preseason,'' Fassel said.</p>
        <p>At every opportunity, the Giants looked shaky. In the first half, long snapper Jason Whittle fired the ball over the head of punter Brad Maynard. With three seconds left in the first half, place kicker Brad Daluiso lined up to attempt a 52-yard field goal. But the ball was not snapped before the play clock expired.</p>
        <p>The delay-of-game penalty moved the ball back five yards -- too far for the Giants to try another field goal. When Fassel called for Collins to try a long pass to a crowd of receivers and defensive backs in the end zone, it was intercepted.</p>
        <p>Later, midway through the fourth quarter, when Daluiso got a chance to try a 45-yard field goal, he missed it. Had Daluiso been able to convert either attempt, the Giants might have been able to tie the game, since the Giants scored a touchdown in the game's last minute.</p>
        <p>The mental blunders and penalties were not limited to the offense. The Jets scored a touchdown on a second-quarter flea flicker when Garnes and cornerback Dave Thomas were fooled by the run fake. When Jets running back Curtis Martin turned and pitched the ball back to quarterback Ray Lucas before he got to the line of scrimmage, neither Garnes nor Thomas were in position to catch up to wide receiver Wayne Chrebet, who had streaked behind both as the fake was executed. Chrebet caught Lucas's pass for a 52-yard touchdown.</p>
        <p>Barrow was also called for defensive pass interference in the second quarter, as was Thomas.</p>
        <p>The Jets were throwing to Thomas's side of the field frequently and rarely toward Sehorn, a strategy that future Giants opponents are likely to emulate. Although Jets fullback Richie Anderson cut across the field in front of Sehorn to catch a well-thrown Lucas pass for a Jets touchdown, most of the Jets' passes were thrown in Thomas's direction.</p>
        <p>Thomas, who is 6-foot-3 and 218 pounds, seemed a step slow for the Jets' smaller, quicker receivers. Dedric Ward beat Thomas on two receptions, including a pivotal 16-yard gain on a third-down play, and Chrebet also caught a 17-yard pass with Thomas covering.</p>
        <p>When the Jets passing attack wasn't causing the Giants trouble, Martin was slicing through the defense. Martin had 70 rushing yards in the first half. After three quarters, he left the game with 107 yards on 18 carries.</p>
        <p>''We've got to learn to play a draw,'' Fassel said.</p>
        <p>There were things about the Giants' third preseason game that were similar to their first two games. Collins had his third successive strong game throwing the ball, completing 16 of 28 passes for 275 yards and 2 touchdowns. Amani Toomer had another spectacular game, smoothly catching a 73-yard bomb from Collins. And Barber, except for his fumble, continued to excel in limited rushing attempts and as a receiver out of the backfield.</p>
