      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The speech, confident and powerful, rang through the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles and, far across the country in South Florida, made Darren Gentry reconsider voting for George W. Bush.</p>
        <p>But that speech was President  Clinton's address on Monday night, three days before Vice President Al Gore took the microphone.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gentry, a registered independent who works as a fitness manager in Coral Springs, was leaning toward Mr. Bush when Mr. Clinton took that podium. As the president spoke of the prosperity the nation enjoyed during his presidency, Mr. Gentry, watching on television, began to doubt the wisdom of change.</p>
        <p>''I think it turned me around,'' he said.</p>
        <p>It was Mr. Gore's vote to lose, as he took his turn on stage on Thursday night. He did not lose it. He did not win it, either. His speech lacked real passion, Mr. Gentry said, repeating the criticism that has long dogged Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>''A lot of words,'' Mr. Gentry said, as he watched. ''It doesn't seem like he's conveying his emotions.''</p>
        <p>And, he said, Mr. Gore had made promises without saying how he would deliver. In other words, Mr. Gentry said, the speech lacked style and substance.</p>
        <p>As for Mr. Gentry, he is back where he started, in the middle. At least for Mr. Gore's sake, he no longer is leaning the other way.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gentry is not alone in his ambivalence, judging from conversations this week with a handful of voters across the country. The interviews, conducted here and in Denver, Seattle, Maplewood, N.J., and with convention delegates in Los Angeles, evoked a wide range of opinions. But if one theme predominated, it was this: that while Mr. Gore did not by any means clinch the race with his appearance at the convention, his speech was better than many unconvinced voters had expected -- good enough, at least, for them now to consider what he had to say.</p>
        <p>In vote-rich Florida, which has elected Mr. Bush's brother Jeb as its governor, the vast majority of Republicans have refused to even think about jumping across the party line and joining Mr. Gore. This convention seemed the vice president's best opportunity to cement his base with unexcited Democrats and, maybe, to sway independent voters here.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gentry, 25, liked what he saw in Mr. Bush's campaign coming out of the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>''I like what he's doing with Social Security,'' allowing people to invest a percentage of it, Mr. Gentry said. ''I believe he's building a strong nucleus of people who support him, people like John McCain and Colin Powell.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, going into his own convention, just seemed bland, Mr. Gentry said. But Mr. Gentry began to waver as he listened to Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>''Clinton made a great speech,'' he said. ''He nailed it. I think it was the best speech of his entire presidency. Why change things? When was the economy this good? And the Republican Party keeps saying that we need this massive change? Obviously that's not true.''</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Gentry said he would have to listen to more campaigning before he firmly made up his mind, Mr. Gore had a chance at the convention at least to continue his advantage going into the speech. But Mr. Gentry said he did not do that.</p>
        <p>''He is saying, 'I will, I will,' but he is not saying how,'' Mr. Gentry said of Mr. Gore's speech. ''I'd like him to tell me how he plans to implement his ideas.''</p>
        <p>He did find some reasons for preferring the Democratic platform, after watching both conventions.</p>
        <p>Several voters interviewed this week said that the two conventions seemed programmed, almost too smooth, but Mr. Gentry was pricked by one thing about the Republican convention. The Republicans spoke a lot about their diversity, he said, but did not back up their claims with real proof.</p>
        <p>''What Clinton kept saying about diversity is true,'' he said. ''Look at the people in his administration. That's diversity.''</p>
        <p>While Mr. Clinton's speech inspired traditional Democrats, Mr. Gore's speech seemed to comfort them.</p>
        <p>Adele Yuckman, 82, of Key Biscayne, watched Mr. Gore from bed. ''Of course he's dull,'' Mrs. Yuckman said, watching his speech, propped up on pillows, a book close by. ''But he isn't as dull as he usually is.''</p>
        <p>She will vote for him.</p>
        <p>''Personality isn't everything,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Among Miami's Cuban-Americans, there seemed little Mr. Gore could say to win over a voting bloc that lands solidly, election after election, on the Republican side.</p>
        <p>The Elian Gonzalez case turned many here even more solidly against the Clinton administration. Mr. Gore's split with his party -- he said that family court should decide the custody -- has been dismissed by many voters here as a weak gesture, politically motivated.</p>
        <p>But in the slivers of that community where people have voted Democrat -- or at least considered it -- it was Mr. Clinton's speech, again, that made voters consider Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>Raul Serrano, 58, a mortgage broker, watched the convention with his brother, Ruben Serrano, 56. They are both registered Republicans. ''The speech,'' Raul Serrano said of Mr. Clinton, ''reminded me of the good things the Democrats have done. I don't think it will be that bad with Gore, after all.''</p>
        <p>His brother, a real estate agent, said he would have a hard time voting for Mr. Gore, but was also undecided. ''These conventions are just all-night parties that are not helping me at all,'' he grumbled.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's speech, to Ruben Serrano, was more of the same. ''A big show,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Raul Serrano warmed to Mr. Gore during his speech. ''I think the guy needs to be given a chance,'' he said. ''I think he strengthened his position.''</p>
        <p>And, he said, ''he seems to be loosening up.''</p>
        <p>The convention was far from a fixation for many people here in South Florida. But, because the Florida Marlins were off, the patrons at Nippers Bar in Boca Raton tuned a television to Mr. Gore's speech.</p>
        <p>''If it ain't broke, don't fix it,'' said Geoff Klein, a 25-year-old stockbroker from Boca Raton who has made up his mind to vote for Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>A few tables away, a group of men stared at another television with excitement. They seemed impressed by what they saw.</p>
        <p>But they were watching wrestling.</p>
