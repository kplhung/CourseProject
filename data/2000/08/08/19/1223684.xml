        <p>LEWIS-Constance Dengel (Connie), 75, of John's Island in Vero Beach, FL. Died at home on Wednesday morning, August 16, 2000. After a short remission her breast cancer had recurred as brain cancer. Though her relapse was sudden and unexpected, she passed away peacefully, painlessly, and with many loved ones at her side. Connie was born on March 15, 1925 in Brooklyn, NY, the second of three children to Edward and Veronica Dengel. She attended Sacred Heart Academy in Manhattan and upon her marriage to John T. Lewis, originally of Short Hills, NJ, in October 1956, they settled in Fairfield, CT. A champion wife, mother, golfer and friend, she is survived by her husband John; four children, Cindy Sweeting of Ft. Lauderdale, FL, John Jr., of New York City, Michael of Smithfield, VA and James of Weston, FL; a sister Roni of Montclair, NJ and seven grandchildren. A daughter, Anne Marie, died in 1991. After 38 years in Fairfield, she and John retired to Vero Beach in 1994. Long a fixture on the women's golf scene in Fairfield and Westchester Counties, Connie was a winner of many golf titles, including 12 championships at Brooklawn Country Club in CT. She was a past president of both the Women's Tri-County Golf Association and the Women's Westchester-Fairfield Golf Association. Connie exuded great warmth, class and humor to all. One could not find a better mate, mother, or friend. She will be deeply and widely missed. A Mass of the Resurrection will be held at 10 AM on Monday, August 21 at Holy Cross Catholic Church, Vero Beach, FL. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to The American Cancer Society, Covenant House, or the American Diabetes Association. For information contact, Strunk Funeral Home, Vero Beach.</p>
