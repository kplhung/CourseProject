        <p>The Golden Venture disgorged its human cargo -- 286 desperate Chinese immigrants who had endured 100 harrowing days at sea -- into the cold and pounding surf off Queens at 2 a.m. on June 6, 1993. Ten died before reaching shore, others endured years in detention and the name of the freighter became synonymous with the willingness to profit from human aspiration and desperation.</p>
        <p>Now, on Tuesday, the ship -- since rechristened the United Caribbean -- will return to the sea for good. Cleaned and stripped, it will be towed about a mile off the coast of Boca Raton, Fla., and sunk in about 70 feet of water to create an artificial reef.</p>
        <p>The total cost for Palm Beach County to turn the aging freighter into a home for marine life is $60,000, according to Janet Phipps, an environmental analyst for the county who is overseeing the reef's creation. That is twice the amount that each immigrant was supposed to pay for passage to the United States.</p>
        <p>The ship, which has been sitting unused on the Miami River, was bought from a company called Export Terminal. Its owner, Juan Lopez, did not return phone calls seeking comment, but he told The Associated Press he had inherited the ship as a custodian for a court case involving previous owners. The ship was sold by the United States Marshals Service, which seized it after it  ran aground off the Rockaway Peninsula.</p>
        <p>Ms. Phipps, who said she did not know the ship's history until recently, added that the reef would be a living memorial of sorts that is fitting in a state where desperate Caribbean refugees regularly wash ashore.</p>
        <p>Viewing the 147-foot-long ship on Thursday, she said: ''You sit there and look at it and you just can't fathom that 300 people were crammed down there. It does kind of give you the chills. The desperation of people who would go to those extremes -- it's hard to imagine as a person who's grown up in this country.''</p>
        <p>The Chinese aboard the Golden Venture endured an ordeal that began to seem almost absurdly cruel. After nearly four months in suffocating squalor, with minimal food and water, they were ordered to swim ashore when the ship grounded. Then they were rounded up and detained, in some cases for more than three years. At least 170 were repatriated to China.</p>
        <p>More than 20 people were ultimately convicted for their role in the lucrative smuggling operation.</p>
        <p>Jeffrey Lobach, a lawyer in York, Pa., where many of the immigrants were detained for three and a half years, said those who were not repatriated have adjusted well to American life.</p>
        <p>The man he represented, and whom he now considers a son, has settled nearby, is working at two jobs, married his girlfriend in China and is now trying to bring her to the United States. Many of the others moved to New York, Washington or the West Coast, Mr. Lobach said, often working at more than one job to survive.</p>
        <p>''I don't think any of them would care to preserve the Golden Venture,'' he said. ''Their 100 days on there were something a lot of them still have nightmares about.''</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Lobach said, there were good things that came from the Golden Venture's misadventure. An odd assortment of citizens in the York area were drawn into action by the prisoners in their midst, demonstrating for their freedom outside the York County Prison for 186 straight Sundays.</p>
        <p>Because the federal government has detained an increasing number of asylum seekers at the York prison in recent years, the Golden Venture coalition established both the Pennsylvania Immigration Resource Center, which gives free legal advice to asylum seekers, and an international friendship house for detainees released from the jail. The house has already given refuge to Iranians, Iraqis, Bosnians, Liberians and others, Mr. Lobach said.</p>
        <p>Other good things will come as well, said Ms. Phipps, the Palm Beach biologist. Within a few years, she said, the ship will be surrounded by radiant tropical fish and coated with colorful sponges and coral.</p>
        <p>''A ship that had an ugly past will become something beautiful,'' she said.</p>
