        <p>They are not anonymous anymore. But like their city, the Cleveland Rockers are still struggling to gain recognition and respect despite their recent success.</p>
        <p>''No one believed in us,'' said Merlakia (Lake) Jones, Cleveland's only All-Star, immediately after the Rockers dismantled the favored Liberty, 56-43, Thursday night to open the Eastern Conference finals with a victory at home. ''No one thought we would even make the playoffs.''</p>
        <p>Cleveland, virtually the same team that was 7-25 last year and that lost its leading scorer on July 1 of this season, is now one game from reaching the Women's National Basketball Association finals, where they could face superstars named Swoopes, Cooper or Leslie.</p>
        <p>The Liberty, the best team in the Eastern Conference this year with veteran stars like Tari Phillips, Teresa Weatherspoon and Vickie Johnson, returns to Madison Square Garden on Sunday afternoon, facing elimination in the two-of-three-game series.</p>
        <p>''We got spanked,'' Johnson said with a sigh in the locker room at Gund Arena after shooting 1 for 14, her worst performance of the season.</p>
        <p>The Rockers shut down New York's offense Thursday night, limiting its top scorers -- Phillips, Johnson, Tamika Whitmore and Becky Hammon -- to 27 points combined.</p>
        <p>In doing so, the Rockers revealed more than New York's vulnerability. ''I think people are starting to see what I've seen all year,'' the Rockers' coach, Dan Hughes, said. ''We are a real team. We have good players who are just defining themselves in the league. We may not be as recognizable as some players right now, but the future is really bright.''</p>
        <p>The past, present and future converge at point guard, where the rookie point guard Helen Darling, 21, and Suzie McConnell Serio, 35, who will retire after this year, have lifted the Rockers above others' expectations. They are a two-headed coin at point guard, both graduates of Penn State spanning basketball eras. They split time, and recently, with either in the game, the Rockers do not seem to lose.</p>
        <p>Darling, with a solid lower body, is deceptively quick and smothering on defense. McConnell Serio, the mother of four and a high school coach who looks as if she could be 16, still plays gritty and smart. She scored 10 points, had 5 assists and made 2 timely 3-pointers against the Liberty. Darling had a steal, an assist and a layup in the run that solidified the victory.</p>
        <p>''It'd be nice to take Suzie out with a win,'' Darling said of her idol, whose record of 1,307 collegiate assists she had unsuccessfully chased. ''But we're not just doing it for her, we all have the same attitude.''</p>
        <p>That new attitude started with Hughes, the new coach, who is little known nationally. Born in Lowell, Ohio, he coached at all levels in the state until he became the interim coach of the Charlotte Sting last year. (He brought that team to the playoffs against New York.)</p>
        <p>''He tells us this is the time of year to have fun and not worry about pressure,'' said Rushia Brown, a 6-foot-2-inch forward. Center Chasity Melvin, a third-year pro, led the team with 11.7 points a game this year, but Brown led all scorers with 18 Thursday night. Lithe, yet physical, Brown has blossomed this year under Hughes's direction.</p>
        <p>In Gund Arena, the fans understand that, hanging a banner that reads: ''Dan is the Man.'' He drafted a promising rookie, 6-4 Ann Wauters, 19, with the top pick of the W.N.B.A. draft. He then selected Darling in the second round, and instilled his team with confidence. He designed plays for Jones, who elevates on her jump shot, to freelance. He reconfigured the team, starting the second-year small forward Mery Andrade when the All-Star Eva Nemcova sustained a season-ending knee injury.</p>
        <p>''This has reminded me of why I went into coaching,'' Hughes, 44, said. ''It is so satisfying seeing people bond in situations that are tough and find a way to be successful.''</p>
        <p>The situation will be no tougher than in the Garden for Game 2 on Sunday. For all their success at home, winning 16 of 19, the Rockers are 4-13 on the road.</p>
        <p>''The road has not been our friend all year,'' Jones said. ''This is a new season and we are going to New York thinking positively. If we take this tough, hard-nosed defense on the road, then I think we will be successful.''</p>
