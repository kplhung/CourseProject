        <p>As the confetti fell and the delegates thundered in Los Angeles, there was a far more modest eruption of glee at the Corcoran home here, where three generations of women were watching Al Gore's long-awaited televised pitch to the nation.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Gore promised that his administration would serve the people, not the powerful, Lois Corcoran, 39, just home from her nursing job, whooped along with the ecstatic throng at the Staples Center. Her daughter, Amanda Orem, 18, who will vote this year for the first time, cheered, as well.</p>
        <p>After weeks of doubting Mr. Gore and his ability to win over a crowd, Ms. Orem and her mother said they were pleased by his speech -- and relieved.</p>
        <p>''I was kind of worried he'd be a dud, but he came off great,'' said Ms. Orem, a sophomore at the College of New Jersey who is registered independent. ''His words seemed heartfelt. As a struggling middle-class family, we felt like he was talking to us.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's presidential coming out may not have won over many rock-ribbed Republicans, but interviews with a dozen New Jersey Democrats and independents found that he had enough zest to turn them, at least, from tepid supporters into veritable stalwarts.</p>
        <p>Until Mr. Gore mounted the stage, many Democrats and independents spoke of the vice president as if he were a kindly, if somewhat insufferable, uncle.</p>
        <p>''I wish he wasn't so stiff and didn't seem so distant,'' said Jo Allen Henry, 44, a fourth-grade teacher from Plainfield. ''He needs to be more lively.''</p>
        <p>Jim Davis did not look entirely mesmerized as he sat in his living room watching Mr. Gore jab the air with his hands. Still, at least he did not join his wife, who dozed through the entire 52-minute speech.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, Gore doesn't compare to Clinton,'' said Mr. Davis, 36, a medical recruiter from Bloomfield, ''but he was much more dynamic than I expected. There were a couple of times where he threw in some fake laughter, but everyone does it. Except Clinton.''</p>
        <p>It remains to be seen whether Mr. Gore is succeeding in crafting an identity separate from that of his charismatic boss. After watching him speak, Georgianna Walsh, 55, an elementary school teacher from Montville, said she was satisfied that he would be his own man. But most of all, Mrs. Walsh thought he had shown Americans that he would spare them from the indignities of the Clinton years.</p>
        <p>''He seems wholesome and honest,'' Mrs. Walsh said, unlike the president, whom she called a disappointment.</p>
        <p>But if Mrs. Walsh has been sold, her husband, Mike, has not. A construction worker, union loyalist and National Rifle Association member, Mr. Walsh, 55, is a registered Democrat who usually hopscotches his way through a ballot without regard to party affiliations. He voted for Ronald Reagan and George Bush, but he also voted for Mr. Clinton the second time around.</p>
        <p>Despite what he termed a decent performance by the vice president, Mr. Walsh said he had not been entirely impressed by Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>''I still might pick Bush or even Ralph Nader,'' he said. ''We'll see what happens.''</p>
        <p>In a swing state like New Jersey, where half the voters are independents and where recent polls show the two candidates neck and neck, pulling in voters like Ms. Orem will be critical. But in his effort to play to the middle and the left, Mr. Gore runs the risk of turning off voters like Mr. Walsh, who sees Mr. Gore as too liberal.</p>
        <p>By contrast, die-hard progressives like Steven Cherry, 44, of Wayne, said Mr. Gore and his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, were too conservative. Despite the vice president's populist proposals for working-class America and Mr. Lieberman's efforts to recast his positions on affirmative action, Mr. Cherry was not swayed.</p>
        <p>''Lieberman is too moralistic and Gore doesn't have any moral fiber,'' said Mr. Cherry, who edits engineering publications on the Internet. ''I'll vote for them, but I'll be holding my nose.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Henry, who is black, said she resented Mr. Gore's emphasis on hiring more police officers, and she complained that the Democrats were not doing enough to ease racism, joblessness and the despair in her community.</p>
        <p>''Everyone keeps talking about this great era of prosperity,'' Ms. Henry said, ''but in the black community, you just don't see it.''</p>
        <p>In the end, however, she said she would swallow her cynicism, vote for Mr. Gore and hope for the best.</p>
        <p>''I liked a lot of what he said, especially on education and campaign finance reform,'' she said, ''but I've seen too many candidates make promises they don't keep.''</p>
