        <p>A Queens nightclub, the scene of a series of violent incidents during the last few years, has been ordered closed as a public nuisance.</p>
        <p>Justice Arthur W. Lonschein of State Supreme Court in Queens ordered the club, the Metropolis nightclub, closed for a year. The police padlocked the club, at 31-99 123rd Street in College Point, on Thursday night.</p>
        <p>Two men were seriously injured and three others were slashed with a knife at the club two weeks ago. Last August, a gunman opened fire on a van in the club's parking lot, killing a  29-year-old man and wounding three other people, two of them critically.</p>
        <p>The police said many summonses -- at least 15 since February -- had been issued at the club for underage drinking and other violations. The club was closed in March, but was allowed to reopen after a week.</p>
