        <p>Paul O'Neill, the Yankees' right fielder, sharply criticized the home plate umpire Gary Cederstrom after last night's game against Anaheim, saying that Cederstrom had retaliated to some of O'Neill's actions by calling him out on strikes. ''That was the most intentional thing I've ever seen in my life,'' said O'Neill, who griped about a strike call in the fourth inning, and was called out on a pitch that appeared to be outside the strike zone. O'Neill turned and confronted Cederstrom, before being pushed away by Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager. Cederstrom did not eject O'Neill, but the rest of the game, he and O'Neill traded words and glares, even as the umpire left the field after the game.</p>

        <p>Torre called the situation disturbing. ''I didn't hear any of the conversations,'' Torre said. ''It certainly looked like Gary was bothered by something and pranced around a little bit.'' Cederstrom declined to comment.</p>
