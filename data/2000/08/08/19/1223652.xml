        <p>Vinny Testaverde and his banged-up toe stayed on the soggy sideline tonight, resting for the season opener.</p>
        <p>But while Testaverde frets that he needs more preparation for Green Bay on Sept. 3, Curtis Martin has been breaking tackles as if he is in midseason form. Martin had 107 yards on 18 rushes and, with Ray Lucas, propelled the Jets to a 27-24 victory over the Giants in their final preseason game.</p>
        <p>Martin, who said he had his best preseason ever, rushed 50 times for 258 yards in the four games and his 24-yard run down the sideline in the fourth quarter tonight led to the 39-yard field goal that put the Jets ahead, 20-17.</p>
        <p>Lucas, who finished with 19 completions in 26 attempts for 286 yards and 3 touchdowns, proved again that he can lead the team in Testaverde's absence. He drove the second offense on an 81-yard drive that culminated in a 30-yard touchdown pass to Jermaine Wiggins late in the fourth quarter that sealed the victory.</p>
        <p>But this game did little to quell lingering concerns about the starting defense, which gave up 17 points to a Giants offense that sometimes seemed to have trouble getting out of its own way in a sloppily played game.</p>
        <p>The secondary was porous, allowing the floundering Giants' offense to right itself on several occasions.</p>
        <p>''They whipped us,'' said linebacker Michael Barrow. 'They beat us. They beat us bad.'</p>
        <p>In the Giants' lone offensive highlight of the first half, receiver Amani Toomer blew by Marcus Coleman, and evaded the late-arriving Omar Stoutmire, for a 73-yard touchdown catch from Kerry Collins (16 of 28 for 275 yards and two touchdowns).</p>
        <p>The Jets' defense has been suspect during the preseason -- it was picked apart in Green Bay, and played only slightly better against the Ravens -- and the troubling pattern of missing tackles and letting receivers get open continued in the third quarter.</p>
        <p>On the drive in which the Giants tied the score at 17-17, Collins found Toomer over Victor Green and Otis Smith for a 36-yard gain. Later, Tiki Barber, on third-and-1 from the 15-yardline, ran for 7 yards along the right sideline, aided by at least three missed tackles. Ike Hilliard's 10-yard touchdown reception came at Stoutmire's expense. In all, the Giants had 487 yards offense, 377 of it from the passing game.</p>
        <p>''I would like to have had a more solid outing there,'' Coach Al Groh said simply of his secondary.</p>
        <p>Groh was remarkably upbeat afterward, though, a testament to how impressive the offense was and to what a boost it provided the Jets (2-2). After their 10-0 loss at the hands of the Ravens last week, the Jets had bemoaned how ineffective their offense had looked, especially when confronted with a bullying pass rush that throttled the offensive line and led to injuries suffered by Testaverde and Chad Pennington (knee).</p>
        <p>The Giants' defense simply is not an equal to the Ravens' and the Jets exploited it. Lucas played all but the final drive for the Jets and he was virtually mistake-free. The first drive went eight plays and 66 yards for a touchdown. A 5-yard catch by Richie Anderson gave the Jets a 7-0 lead before five minutes had elapsed. Of the nine drives Lucas led, the Jets scored on five -- including one that culminated with a 52-yard touchdown pass to receiver Wayne Chrebet on a flea flicker -- and John Hall had a field-goal attempt blocked in third quarter.</p>
        <p>''He did an excellent job,'' Groh said. ''I congratulated Ray, but it's what Ray and I expect and what the team expects.''</p>
        <p>Lucas joked as he took the podium in the interview room at Giants Stadium that he had forgotten what it felt like to be interviewed after the game.</p>
        <p>''This is Vinny's team, but if he goes down, I'm ready,'' Lucas said. ''In Baltimore, we didn't put points on the board and that hurt my feelings because I was in there at the start. But I think we're a better team with Vinny in there. He's got experience. I'm still learning from him. This is his team.''</p>
        <p>Groh said both he and Testaverde wanted the starting quarterback to play, but that 'we had to let prudence take over.''</p>
        <p>With Keyshawn Johnson gone and a third receiver unable to emerge, the Jets may turn out to be more Martin's team than anyone's. He set out, he said, to have the best off-season of preparation this year. That, he said, would lead to the best preseason, which would, in turn, evolve into the best regular season. In two weeks, Martin will find out if the pattern will continue.</p>
        <p>''I can always do better,'' Martin said. ''I continuously push myself. I told the guys today that I don't even think I can play football long enough to accomplish all my goals.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>The Giants closed to 27-24 on a 16-yard touchdown pass from JASON GARRETT to JOE JUREVICIUS with 15 seconds remaining but the Jets recovered the onside kick. . . . Cornerback AARON GLENN (ankle) and running back BERNIE PARMALEE (foot) did not dress. RAY MICKENS started in Glenn's place at left corner. . . . FRED BAXTER started at tight end over the rookie ANTHONY BECHT. . . . JAMES FARRIOR started in place of ROMAN PHIFER at right outside linebacker.</p>
