        <p>When it was completed here two years ago to relieve the overcrowding at Lambert Field in St. Louis, the MidAmerica Airport was an airline passenger's dream: a brand-new terminal with free parking just 22 minutes from downtown.</p>
        <p>All it lacked was an airline.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, the $310 million airport, called ''the gateway to nowhere'' by critics, got one. A reconstituted Pan American Airlines started service from MidAmerica to Gary, Ind. All told, the carrier has scheduled four flights a day in and out of the airport.</p>
        <p>While major airports around the country suffer greater congestion than ever, and passengers face a record number of cancellations and delays, airport executives are not surprised that such a fine new one is sitting virtually unused. They attribute this mainly to the reluctance of major carriers to leave the convenience and efficiency they find at hubs like T.W.A.'s at Lambert.</p>
        <p>''As long as a passenger is willing to get on an airplane, airlines tend not to think of how long it takes you to get there, the parking, the hassles, getting through the terminal,'' said Todd Hauptli, senior vice president for policy and government affairs of the American Association of Airport Executives. ''All they care about is that you get in one of their seats. When it becomes such a problem that people choose not to fly, or fly from a different location, airlines sit up and take notice.''</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for Southwest Airlines, Linda Rutherford, said the discount-fare carrier had looked at MidAmerica, ''but we are committed to Lambert, and we have a fairly substantial expansion program going on right now. We are expanding our gates.''</p>
        <p>MidAmerica had not met several of Southwest's criteria, Ms. Rutherford, said, though that is subject to change. ''Most travelers are on the west side of St. Louis, and that's where Lambert is. MidAmerica would be more of a trek.''</p>
        <p>American Airlines, which has flights from Lambert, also decided against MidAmerica. ''At this time, we don't think there are the passenger loads that would be necessary,'' a spokesman there said.</p>
        <p>Rick Hargrove, MidAmerica's director, said he knew congestion firsthand, as deputy director of Lambert Field from 1989 to 1994.</p>
        <p>All 3,000 acres of Lambert, he said, are ''for all practical purposes, totally built up. There is no more room for air cargo, maintenance, repair or overhaul.''</p>
        <p>At Lambert, the hub for Trans World Airlines, 17 million people a year board airplanes. Then again, sometimes they don't. The delay time, Mr. Hargrove said, was ''in excess of 20,000 hours a year.''</p>
        <p>As travelers learn to their dismay, the runways at Lambert, built 1,300 feet apart, are too close together for simultaneous operation in bad weather. When visibility is less than three miles or the ceiling is less than 1,500 feet, one runway must close. A third runway, to be completed in 2007, is expected to cost more than $2.6 billion.</p>
        <p>Here in the cornfields, MidAmerica sits on 8,000 acres, with room to expand and two runways set 7,000 feet apart. A military runway was extended to 8,000 feet. And the new runway is 10,000 feet long.</p>
        <p>Roxann Reum, of Collinsville, Ill., greeted her daughter, arriving today at MidAmerica on a Pan Am flight from Sanford, Fla., as the girl returned from visiting her grandmother.</p>
        <p>''There's no traffic and no parking hassles,'' Ms. Reum said happily, adding that like MidAmerica, Sanford was a satellite airport for the Orlando area. ''My mom hates the Orlando airport. It takes her two hours to get there.''</p>
        <p>MidAmerica was built next to Scott Air Force Base. Even before the airport found a civilian airline, state officials, who put up $60 million, felt it was worth the cost.</p>
        <p>''The plan to build MidAmerica was a critical factor in keeping Scott Air Force Base open,'' said Martha Schiebel, a spokeswoman for the Illinois Department of Transportation. ''It employs more than 10,000 people and is one of the biggest employers in the area.''</p>
        <p>The longer runway also drew the 126th Refueling Wing of the Air National Guard, which moved from O'Hare Airport in Chicago, another vastly overcrowded field that needed the space. The Guard brought 300 full-time and 1,000 part-time employees.</p>
        <p>At the moment, the new 190-foot airport tower is staffed by military air traffic controllers. When civilian traffic exceeds military traffic, civilians will take over.</p>
        <p>Today, Pan Am ticket agents worked without benefit of a conveyor belt for luggage, but one is on the way, along with office space.</p>
        <p>Walking through the terminal, Mr. Hargrove pointed out how the baggage area could quickly be converted to accommodate international flights and how the terminal, which now has four gates, could be extended to handle as many as 82.</p>
        <p>''The crowds aren't here,'' he said. ''The traffic's not here. We have quick and easy access to the runways for takeoffs.''</p>
        <p>David Fink, who acquired the Pan Am name and logo in 1998 -- the original carrier went bankrupt in 1991 -- and is now president of the new airline, said the airport and airline both hope to fill niches as air travel is expected to double in the next 10 years.</p>
        <p>He plans to use uncongested airports in metropolitan areas to provide low-cost flights, first to the leisure market and then to business travelers. ''We're not looking to fill up every plane,'' he said. ''We're hoping to bring a little civility and make a dollar.''</p>
        <p>Pan Am, based in Portsmouth, N.H., has scheduled flights from airports in Portsmouth, Bangor, Me., and Pittsburgh, as well as Mascoutah, Gary, and Sanford. Starting Saturday, the MidAmerica flights to Gary will continue on to Pittsburgh and Portland.</p>
        <p>David Plavin, president of the Airports Council International, said MidAmerica was unusual only because these days ''most people don't have the foresight and the courage to build before the demand materializes.''</p>
        <p>''There was a time,'' he added, ''when it was routine to build in advance of immediate demand: Newark, Dulles, Dallas and even Denver were all built before the demand actually materialized. No one considers them white elephants.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 21, 2000, Monday  An article on Saturday about the start of scheduled service at the little-used MidAmerica Airport near St. Louis misstated the destination of the newest Pan Am flight there. It goes from MidAmerica to Gary, Ind., and continues to Pittsburgh and Portsmouth, N.H., not Portland.</p>
