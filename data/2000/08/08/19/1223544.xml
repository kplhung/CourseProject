        <p>Hours after they clinked Champagne glasses on Thursday evening, winners in Germany's $46 billion auction for wireless licenses began feeling the hangover today.</p>
        <p>In the most vivid case of winner's remorse, Hutchison Whampoa of Hong Kong immediately announced that it was pulling out of one of the six groups that won a license because the prices were simply too high. Hutchison, which is loaded with cash as a result of selling its stake in the British mobile phone company Orange P.L.C., had been partners with the Dutch telephone company KPN and NTT DoCoMo of Japan.</p>
        <p>Hutchison was supposed to contribute 22.5 percent of the group's license fee, and that money will probably be made up by KPN and the BellSouth Corporation, which owns 50 percent of KPN's mobile telephone unit.</p>
        <p>Standard &amp; Poor's, meanwhile, confirmed that it would reduce the credit ratings for most of the big telephone companies involved in the bidding: Deutsche Telekom of Germany; France Telecom, which is investing through the German company Mobilcom A.G.; British Telecommunications P.L.C., which is investing through Viag Interkom; and KPN.</p>
        <p>Investors also continued to sell stocks in the winning companies. Mobilcom's stock plunged 7 percent today in Frankfurt, to 110 euros from 117. Telefonica S.A. of Spain and Sonera Oy of Finland, which lead a group called Group 3G, saw their shares decline by similar amounts on their exchanges. Shares of Deutsche Telekom, the German telephone giant that is determined to build a pan-European network, had already lost half their value since the company paid $6 billion for a similar wireless license in Britain in April; today, Telekom nudged down a further 2.5 percent after pledging to pay $7.6 billion for its German license.</p>
        <p>In the aftermath of the frenzied bidding, analysts and company executives generally agreed that the auction's outcome was about the worst one possible. Beyond the dizzying level of the prices offered, the real surprise was that the auction produced six rivals rather than five.  Deutsche Telekom and Vodafone AirTouch P.L.C., the two biggest wireless players in Europe, had been determined to outbid seemingly weaker bidders like Group 3G and acquire enough licenses to reduce the field.</p>
        <p>But even though only seven groups joined the bidding originally, one of which dropped out last Friday, neither Telekom nor Vodafone was able to force out any of the other six. What they did manage to do was push up the total price of licenses by nearly $15 billion between Monday morning and Thursday afternoon.</p>
        <p>Ron Sommer, chief executive of Deutsche Telekom, complained on Thursday night that the auction had been distorted because some of the rival telephone companies came from countries that awarded licenses to them for little or no money.  Telekom officials were particularly incensed by Telefonica of Spain, part of the victorious Group 3G, because the Spanish government had awarded it a Spanish wireless license at very low cost while rejecting Telekom's application.</p>
        <p>The deeper question is when or even whether the huge bets on third-generation wireless licenses will pay off. Using a technological standard called United Mobile Telecommunications Service, or U.M.T.S., the telephone companies hope to offer high-speed data transmission that will give people wireless access to the Internet and a host of new mobile commercial and information services.</p>
        <p>But the companies must first build the new networks and then market an entire generation of new services, most of which are still unknown to consumers. Industry executives say the networks will not be ready until at least 2002 or 2003, though all operators will be under heavy pressure to have their networks running as soon as possible.</p>
        <p>Gerhard Schmid, the chief executive of Mobilcom, predicted that his company could break even on its investment by 2005. Most other companies have been reluctant to divulge their time-frames for turning a profit.</p>
