        <p>GILBARD-Marion. Our beloved sister and aunt, astoundingly beautiful and elegant at 73, brimming with joy, having found love again after the loss of her beloved husband, Harris Gilbard, lost her battle with pancreatic cancer. Her easy going, warm hearted, generous nature was only surpassed by her courage. Her loving goodbyes to all of us as she stared death in the face were the final gifts of this most graceful spirit. Marion, we will miss you. Helen Rodbell Hank, Gerry, David and Brooke Alpert Alain, Ellen, Erica and Remy Roizen</p>
        <p>GILBARD-Marion. My beloved sister, I looked into your eyes and found myself, our shared memories together as children, our loves and losses as adults we were forever there for each other with both laughter and tears. My sister, my friend, my confidant I will miss you. Helen Rodbell</p>
