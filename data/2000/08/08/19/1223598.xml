        <p>A federal appeals court judge in Chicago said today that he was the source of a report on Thursday that a new grand jury had been impaneled by the independent counsel investigating President Clinton's relationship with a former White House intern.</p>
        <p>The reports that a new grand jury was reviewing Mr. Clinton brought an angry response on Thursday from Democrats and Republicans who described the leak as an apparent effort to embarrass Vice President Al Gore hours before he accepted the Democratic Party's presidential nomination.</p>
        <p>Today, Richard D. Cudahy of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago, who was appointed to the bench by President Carter in 1979, said he had inadvertently mentioned the new grand jury to a reporter from The Associated Press.</p>
        <p>Judge Cudahy, one of three appellate judges who preside over independent counsel matters, said the reaction to the report prompted him to speak out today.</p>
        <p>The independent counsel, Robert W. Ray, convened the new grand jury in July after saying publicly that he would consider whether Mr. Clinton should be charged after he leaves office in connection with testimony in which he denied having a relationship with Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern.</p>
        <p>Judge Cudahy said today that he wanted ''to set the record straight.''  ''I don't think it ever entered my head it had anything to do with what was going on in the convention,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The judge said he did not want prosecutors in the independent counsel's office to be blamed for the leak. ''I didn't think Robert Ray ought to get blamed for the whole thing, as far as timing was concerned,'' he said.</p>
        <p>White House spokesman Jake Sewert said tonight, ''Wherever the information came from, even after $50 million, an 800-page report, proceedings in both houses of Congress, the independent counsel seems to want this investigation to go on and on and on.</p>
        <p>''The American people have put this episode behind them and they must be wondering why the independent counsel can't do the same,'' Mr. Sewert said.</p>
        <p>Of the three appellate judges who preside over independent counsel matters, Judge Cudahy is the only Democratic appointee.</p>
        <p>The other two judges, David B. Sentelle of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and Peter T. Fay of the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta, are Republican appointees.</p>
        <p>Judge Cudahy said he revealed the existence of the new grand jury in response to the reporter's questions about a one-sentence order issued late Wednesday by the three-judge panel. That order authorized Mr. Ray to continue his investigation for another year, an annual finding required by law.</p>
        <p>The judge said he inadvertently mentioned the grand jury while explaining why he had changed his position on the independent counsel. Last year, Judge Cudahy was the only one on the panel who voted to terminate the independent counsel's operation.</p>
        <p>He said that in explaining his reason for changing his position and voting this year to keep the inquiry open, he mentioned the new grand jury to the reporter. The judge said Mr. Ray had told the judicial panel earlier this year that the impaneling of the new grand jury was one reason prosecutors should be allowed to continue the investigation.</p>
        <p>Today, the independent counsel's office said in a statement that it condemned unauthorized disclosures of information.</p>
        <p>''This disclosure subjected this office to unsubstantiated accusations that this investigation intended to improperly impact the political process,'' the office said in the statement. ''The timing of yesterday's disclosure of the existence of a grand jury considering evidence in the Lewinsky investigation undermines our ability to complete this matter in a prompt, responsible and cost-effective manner.''</p>
