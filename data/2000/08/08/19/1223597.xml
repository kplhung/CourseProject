        <p>The weather lightened today, but tempers lashed out, on the day when authorities had said that 118 Russian sailors trapped under the sea would run out of air.</p>
        <p>Morose and angry, families gathered here, in the biggest city in the Arctic Circle, and in the nearby naval town of Vidyaevo, in a final vigil.</p>
        <p>At Vidyaevo, home to many of the sailors on board the Kursk, the nuclear submarine that sank last weekend, drawn-looking government officials explained the sputtering rescue efforts to mothers and wives in the town's officers club. On local television, pictures of a dazed woman, unable to sit up, preceded frames of women hurling accusations at the officials, their voices shrill and full of pain.</p>
        <p>''Can't you say anything? This is a shame before the whole world,'' one woman yelled.</p>
        <p>''More waiting, another week?'' another shouted.</p>
        <p>''How long can this go on?'' yelled another. ''They are closed up in a canning jar!''</p>
        <p>Officials stared back in silence, their shoulders slumped. Once they discovered the cameramen, uniformed guards demanded they leave.</p>
        <p>Life is difficult enough in this northern place where gardens don't grow, and where satellite television broadcasts barely reach. The town has two schools, and the officers club is its main meeting place. Residents have not had hot water for three months now. City authorities shut it off in the summer, as they do in many of Russia's northern cities.</p>
        <p>''Women held the officials responsible,'' said one woman, who gave her name only as Galina, and whose daughter Sveta is terrified that she has lost her husband, Victor Kuznetsov. Galina has lived in Vidyaevo for more than 20 years.</p>
        <p>''It would have been better if the officials didn't come at all,'' she said, over the phone. ''Either they needed to put a checkmark on their lists, or they were pressured to come by their bosses.''</p>
        <p>Family members continued to arrive from all over the country, frantic for news. As of this morning, 25 relatives of crew members had arrived in Murmansk and were taken to Vidyaevo. Many had endured long train rides, and one woman traveling with her sister even told of having to pay a bribe to get a seat.</p>
        <p>It was rumored that President Vladimir V. Putin would arrive late today. He has been criticized by the Moscow press for not being at the scene of the disaster. But no one here seemed to blame him, and said only that Mr. Putin should fire the military leaders responsible for such bad decisions.</p>
        <p>The governor of the Kursk region, the submarine's namesake and home to seven of the sailors on board, arrived this morning.</p>
        <p>News reports fleshed out new details for the local people, who have been intently watching their televisions. State television RTR sent afternoon newscasts from one of the base boats, the Pyotr Veliki, and showed, for the first time, the striped yellow rescue vehicles plunging into choppy sea.</p>
        <p>Interviews with the rescuers, in orange rain gear, attached faces to some of the people involved in these long days of rescue attempts that until now have been off limits to the public. The stony-faced captain of the rescue operation, Vyacheslav Popov, spoke for several minutes about the task.</p>
        <p>He gave little cause for reassurance.</p>
        <p>''The conditions are very difficult,'' he said. ''Half the fleet is here. We've been working only to save the people, save our people, save our sailors.''</p>
        <p>The news coverage has become eerily routine. Flocks of journalists in expensive raincoats stop passengers arriving in the train station, combing crowds for signs of crew members' families. Northern Fleet headquarters today began to hold regular news conferences twice daily. People tune into news broadcasts every morning, but with little hope.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, in Vidyaevo, Galina was picking cranberries today to soothe her nerves. Her daughter, Sveta, 23, is planning to celebrate the third birthday of her son Dima next week, and Galina expressed the hope that the family would be reunited by then.</p>
        <p>''We do have faith,'' she said.</p>
