        <p>After reeling off their respective victories in the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness in May, Fusaichi Pegasus and Red Bullet were being counted on by many to help reinvigorate the sport.</p>
        <p>Now, neither colt will run in the summer's biggest race for 3-year-olds.</p>
        <p>Joe Orseno, who trains Red Bullet, announced today that he would hold his colt out of next Saturday's Travers Stakes here because of the lingering effects of the same viral infection that caused Red Bullet to skip the Haskell at Monmouth on Aug. 6.</p>
        <p>And with the Derby winner Fusaichi Pegasus finally back in training but still having yet to race since losing the Preakness, the Travers, Saratoga's signature race, is without the two biggest 3-year-olds.</p>
        <p>''Racing needed a horse like Red Bullet and a horse like Fusaichi Pegaus to run against each other,'' Orseno said today. ''It's good for the game.''</p>
        <p>What has not been good for the game is the prolonged absence of either, much less both. ''It's a shame,'' Orseno said, ''because I think the Travers needs a big name.''</p>
        <p>Instead, the race known as the Midsummer Derby will feature a field of nine less distinguished colts, led by the surprise Belmont winner Commendable, who finished last in the Dwyer and second to last in the Haskell his last two times out. Also missing will be Graeme Hall, the upset winner of the Jim Dandy last month at Saratoga. His trainer, Todd Pletcher, said today that the horse had sustained a hairline fracture of his left knee during that race.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Red Bullet and Fusaichi Pegasus keep missing each other, as a once-budding rivalry has all but fizzled. The colts have raced head-to-head only twice, with Fusaichi Pegaus winning the Wood at Aqueduct before Red Bullet returned the favor, and dashed Fusaichi Pegasus' Triple Crown hopes, in the Preakness.</p>
        <p>Fusaichi Pegasus, who was syndicated for a reported $60 million last weekend, began working out again in Southern California this week.</p>
        <p>Red Bullet last raced on July 9 at Belmont, where he finished third in the Dwyer.</p>
        <p>Taking a cautious approach, Orseno and the colt's owner, Frank Stronach, had held Red Bullet out of both the Kentucky Derby and the Belmont, hoping not to overtax the horse. But today, Orseno conceded that the colt ''seems to come up with excuse after excuse.''</p>
        <p>But at least there's next year. Orseno said today that Stronach was committed to racing Red Bullet as a 4-year-old.</p>
