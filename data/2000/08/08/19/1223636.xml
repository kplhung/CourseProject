        <p>The bizarre injury of the week belongs to Rocco Mediate, the winner of the Buick Open last Sunday. He had to withdraw today after his chair broke while he was sitting outside the contestant family dining area on Thursday.</p>
        <p>Mediate, who underwent major back surgery in 1994, injured his right wrist, right shoulder, neck and lower back in the incident. He played with discomfort and shot a first-round 77, but he decided he could not continue.</p>
        <p>Gaylord Sports, Mediate's management firm, was livid that a broken chair had led to Mediate's injury.</p>
        <p>''As his management firm, we are beyond disappointment and particularly upset that Rocco would suffer such consequences due to something that could have and should have been avoided,'' said the statement by Gaylord Sports.</p>
        <p>''He is missing more than just a chance at a major championship title. He was in position to possibly make the President's Cup team by points or as a captain's selection with a good week of play.''</p>
        <p>Several other players withdrew, including Tom Lehman (sore knee), Jim Carter (undisclosed) and Ben Crenshaw (undisclosed).</p>
