        <p>Diageo P.L.C. of Britain, the world's leading liquor company, and Pernod Ricard S.A. of France announced today that they would team up to compete for the wine and spirits business of the Seagram Company. The move is likely to start a bidding war with Allied Domecq P.L.C., the No. 2 liquor concern, that could push the price toward $9 billion.</p>
        <p>Seagram's spirits businesses, which include Chivas Regal premium Scotch whiskey, are to be sold as part of the company's acquisition by Vivendi S.A., the French utility-media conglomerate, which wants to use the proceeds from selling the liquor assets to reduce its $6.6 billion in debts.</p>

        <p>Diageo P.L.C. of Britain, the world's leading liquor company, and Pernod Ricard S.A. of France announced today that they would team up to compete for the wine and spirits business of the Seagram Company. The move is likely to start a bidding war with Allied Domecq P.L.C., the No. 2 liquor concern, that could push the price toward $9 billion.</p>
        <p>Seagram's spirits businesses, which include Chivas Regal premium Scotch whiskey, are to be sold as part of the company's acquisition by Vivendi S.A., the French utility-media conglomerate, which wants to use the proceeds from selling the liquor assets to reduce its $6.6 billion in debts.</p>
        <p>Seagram's wine and spirits business, the third biggest after Diageo and Allied Domecq, represents one of the last major jewels up for grabs in a scramble for profitable, high-profile brands. The major challenger to the Diageo-Pernod Ricard bid, Allied Domecq, owner of Ballantine's Scotch whiskey and Kahlua liqueur, needs an acquisition on this scale to draw level with Diageo. Allied Domecq had initially been viewed as the front-runner for the Seagram liquor business.</p>
        <p>''We have already confirmed our interest in bidding for Seagram's drinks business,'' said Anthony Cardew, a spokesman for Allied Domecq, which also operates the Baskin-Robbins ice cream and Dunkin' Donuts chains.</p>
        <p>Diageo sold 91 million 12-bottle cases of liquor in 1999, while Allied Domecq sold 48 million and Seagram sold 41 million, according to industry figures.</p>
        <p>Diageo, owner of brands that include Johnnie Walker Scotch whiskey, Smirnoff vodka and Gordon's gin, gave no details of its bidding agreement with Pernod Ricard, which has brands including Pernod and Ricard aniseed spirits, Wild Turkey bourbon, Jameson Irish whiskey and Havana Club rum.</p>
        <p>The two companies said in a statement that they had ''agreed to work together to make an offer for Seagram's wine and spirits business in the forthcoming disposal process.''</p>
        <p>Up until a few days ago, Diageo had been widely expected to strike a joint bidding deal with the privately owned Bacardi to bid for the Seagram's businesses, but those talks apparently collapsed over how to divide Seagram's brands.</p>
        <p>Seagram's portfolio ranges from Chivas Regal to Martell cognac, Crown Royal Canadian whiskey and Captain Morgan rum. It also holds distribution rights to Sweden's top-selling premium vodka, Absolut, until 2004, but it remains unclear whether those rights will be included in the auction. If they are not included, the price is likely to be lower, analysts said.</p>
        <p>Diageo was likely to be interested in Seagram's Canadian whiskey and rum brands, while Pernod Ricard, the world's fifth--largest liquor company, would primarily want Chivas Regal, the analysts said. Pernod said its ''major interest is in the Scotch whiskey category.''</p>
        <p>The sale is critical to Diageo's long-range goal of securing its leadership of the liquor business as it sheds other interests to focus on spirits and its Guinness beer holdings. It has sold its Pillsbury food division and plans to spin off its Burger King fast-food chain. Diageo called Seagram's business ''a logical extension to our focus on beverage alcohol.''</p>
        <p>Allied Domecq stock fell 3.6 percent, to 314.5 pence, or about $4.72, a share, and Diageo was down 2.5 percent at 596 pence, or $8.94 a share. In Paris, Pernod Ricard rose 2.56 percent, to 60 euros, or $54.60 a share.</p>
        <p>Pernod Ricard has been looking to expand in the liquor business despite a major setback last year when regulators blocked its planned sale of Orangina soft drinks to the Coca- Cola Company, ending speculation that it planned to use the proceeds to bid for Allied Domecq.</p>
        <p>Another potential bidder in the Seagram auction, which is likely to begin in the next few weeks, is the Bronfman family, which founded Seagram and owns 24 percent of the company. But there was no immediate word today on whether that bid would proceed.</p>
