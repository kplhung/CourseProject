        <p>ALFORD-Margaret M. December 30, 1907-August 17, 2000, of Manhasset, NY. Beloved wife of the late Robert H. Alford. Devoted mother of Margaret Ann Alford of Manhasset, Mrs. Patricia Sears of Port Washington and James R. Alford of Manhasset. Grandmother of Mrs. Sarah Chandonnet of Glen Head and great-grandmother of Caroline Chandonnet. Before she married, Margaret was a fashion model who worked for one of the most exclusive Fur Designers and Salons of the time. The elegance, grace, poise and style of her modeling years remained with her well into advanced age. An avid reader, she was also a frequent European traveler. She often spoke of the beauty of Estoril, Portugal but really felt most at home in England-probably because it was her father's birthplace. Over the years, she accumulated an extensive and valuable collection of antique Pug Dog porcelains, and artwork, and was rarely separated from her loyal, devoted and faithful Pug, ''Oliver''. In repose at The Farichild Funeral Chapel, 1570 Northern Blvd., Manhasset on Sunday from 3-5 and 7-9PM. Funeral Mass Monday 11:15AM, St. Mary's RC Church Manhasset, with interment to follow in Nassau Knolls Cemetery, Port Washington.</p>
