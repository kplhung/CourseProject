        <p>British and French aviation regulators formed a committee today to examine ways to return the Concorde to service ''in safe conditions'' that would protect it against the flaws behind last month's crash near Paris.</p>
        <p>It was the first indication since the crash on July 25 that killed 113 people that France and Britain, whose flag carriers alone fly the needle-nosed Concorde, are eager to return it to service. British aviation authorities, following their French counterparts, this week ordered the supersonic plane grounded, effectively ruling it unfit to fly.</p>
        <p>Following a meeting of French and British aviation officials in London, a statement said both sides ''share the same determination to find a solution that will put the Concorde in service in safe conditions.'' French officials have said they believe that a tire blowout sent chunks of rubber through a fuel tank, causing it to burst into flames as the plane sped toward takeoff.</p>
        <p>The statement by the French transportation ministry said French and British experts would jointly monitor the inquiry into the causes of the crash and cooperate in proposing modifications by the Concorde's builders to prevent burst tires from causing fire. Aviation experts say that a final decision on whether to return the Concorde to service would probably hinge on the cost of modifications necessary to make it airworthy. The companies that built the Concorde are now part of BAE Systems, formerly British Aerospace, and the European Aeronautics, Defense and Space Company, a recent merger of French, German and Spanish aerospace groups.</p>
        <p>Burst tires have been a problem for the Concorde since the plane entered service in 1976. Though the Concordes flown by British Airways were modified to correct the problem, those of Air France were not. That issue could prove crucial if efforts by Air France and its insurers to reach an amicable compensation agreement with families of the victims fail. Most victims were German tourists flying to New York to board a cruise ship. But they also included an American, Christopher Behrens, a retired promotion executive for Air France.</p>
        <p>Gerard Samet, a French lawyer representing the family of one German passenger, said a class action suit was being considered, though any civil court action would have to await ''the outcome of the inquiry, and the establishment of a chain of responsibility.''</p>
        <p>Jean-Michel Ricquel, a spokesman for Reunion Aerienne, of British, French and Italian insurers that is the Concorde's main insurer, said compensation discussions had proceeded until now ''in an amicable fashion.''</p>
        <p>But a lawyer for other German families, Christof Wellens, said today that if the talks failed, the group was preparing a class action suit, possibly before a United States court. Courts in the United States tend to make higher awards than those in Europe.</p>
