        <p>Tiger Woods did not mind sharing the spotlight with Jack Nicklaus, but Woods wanted the lead for himself.</p>
        <p>Capped by a special moment on the 18th green, where Woods and Nicklaus both made birdies, the second day of the P.G.A. Championship ended with Woods in a familiar position, at the top.</p>
        <p>While Nicklaus barely missed the cut and probably played his last round at a P.G.A. Championship, Woods continued his methodical march toward what would be another historic victory.</p>
        <p>But this time, unlike what happened in the United States Open and the British Open, when Woods ran away from the field, the pursuing pack was not very far back.</p>
        <p>Woods was the clubhouse leader at 11 under par (133), holding a one-stroke lead over Scott Dunlap when second-round play was suspended by darkness with 11 players still on the course. Davis Love III, the 1997 winner of the P.G.A. Championship, was tied for third place at seven under par, with Fred Funk and J. P. Hayes. Nicklaus shot a 71 after an opening-round 77.</p>
        <p>So while it has been difficult to play quickly at Valhalla Golf Club, with some of Thursday's rounds taking more than six hours, it has not been difficult to make birdies. Perhaps Woods will ultimately win his third consecutive major, and join Ben Hogan as the only player to win three professional majors in one year. But many other players had legitimate reason to hope, and the weekend had legitimate potential for drama.</p>
        <p>Shooting a five-under-par 67, after an opening-round 66, Woods broke out of a first-round tie with Dunlap (10 under par), who shot a 68 today after an opening-round 66.</p>
        <p>But the focus today was on Nicklaus and Woods, who were paired in the first two rounds for the first time, and probably the last time. Both players finished in style at No. 18, with Nicklaus nearly making an eagle from the fairway before his tap-in birdie, and Woods making a beautiful up-and-down birdie from a difficult position in a green side bunker.</p>
        <p>After Woods's final 15-foot birdie putt disappeared into the hole, Nicklaus smiled approvingly. And after Nicklaus made his birdie, Woods did the same.</p>
        <p>It was a fitting ending to a memorable day, as the gallery serenaded Nicklaus with affection from tee to green. For Nicklaus, winner of 18 professional majors, including five P.G.A. Championships, it was a farewell. But for Woods, the tournament was only beginning.</p>
        <p>''It has been quite a two days,'' said Woods, who can become the first back-to-back winner of the P.G.A. Championship since Denny Shute in 1936 and 1937. ''I enjoyed playing with Jack and it was great for me. Nobody even noticed what I was doing. I'm pleased with where I am because this golf course is very demanding. Any time you shoot 11 under par after 36 holes at a major, you should be leading.''</p>
        <p>When Woods won the United States Open by an astonishing 15 shots in June, he led by six strokes at the halfway mark. When he won the British Open in July by eight shots, he had a three-stroke lead after two rounds. But this time, Woods is not entering the weekend with a lead that looks insurmountable. Dunlap, a 37-year-old who has never won on the PGA Tour, has been the surprise player of the tournament, showing the moxie to stay in contention when most people are waiting for him to fall back.</p>
        <p>Starting the day tied with Woods at six under par, Dunlap nearly kept pace with the world's No. 1 player, and he continued to make huge putts.</p>
        <p>Dunlap made a 35-foot birdie putt at No. 3, he made a 25-footer for birdie at No. 10, and he almost made a 40-foot putt for eagle at No. 18, before settling for a tap-in birdie.</p>
        <p>Can a player who has never won on tour outplay Woods at a major? Dunlap was eager to find out.</p>
        <p>''Tiger will be extremely difficult to beat because you know that is what he lives for,'' Dunlap said. ''He actually gets better at that time, much like Jack did. I don't think there will be many bookies tonight taking bets on Scott Dunlap. I don't have anyone else's expectations to live up to, that's for sure.''</p>
        <p>Asked if anything in his past would prepare him for playing with Woods in Saturday's final group, Dunlap said: ''No. You never know when you're ready. At the end of 72 holes, you realize you didn't choke, you didn't screw up, you won. Who knows? Maybe it will happen this week.''</p>
        <p>Love reached nine under par after a birdie at No. 16, but he finished his day with costly bogeys at both No. 17 and No. 18, a finish Love will regret if he ultimately loses by a shot or two.</p>
        <p>The pace of play has already been regrettable. It has been very slow at times, particularly on Thursday, when some rounds took more than six hours to complete. Players grumbled heavily after play, unhappy about waiting as much as 15 minutes between shots.</p>
        <p>All four par-5 holes are reachable in two shots, so when players reached the tee on a par-five hole, there was often a group standing in the fairway, waiting for the green to clear so they could hit their second shots.</p>
        <p>The deep rough, the long walks between some greens and tee boxes, the humid weather and the severely undulating greens that often left players with long putts, only added to the slow pace.</p>
        <p>But nothing seemed to distract Woods, who remained the man to beat. His birdie at No. 18 today was special, when he hit an impressive bunker shot from a buried lie that cleared a high ridge and settled 15 feet from the cup.</p>
        <p>Woods's lie in the bunker was so bad, and the ridge so steep, he considered hitting out of the bunker sideways. But after his skillful bunker shot, Woods ended the day by making his putt to take the outright lead over Dunlap, who was already in the clubhouse.</p>
        <p>The weekend should be intense. But once again, Woods is the man to catch.</p>
