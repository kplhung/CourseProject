      <block class="full_text">
        <p>BY her own admission, Alberta Lee was a contentious handful as a teenager and a willful, self-absorbed young woman whose lack of direction concerned her conservative immigrant parents.</p>
        <p>''I was the spoiled brat of the family,'' Ms. Lee, 26, stated bluntly. ''I had a hard time getting on my feet.''</p>
        <p>She finds it easy sharing such reflections because in the past 18 months she has left that needy girl light-years behind. She speaks proudly of the sense of purpose that has transformed her into a confident woman, then notes bitterly that the man whose own life-changing experiences forced her to grow has not been able to share the experience. That is because the man, her father, is being held in a federal prison.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lee is the daughter of Wen Ho Lee, the scientist formerly with Los Alamos National Laboratory who is charged with mishandling some of the country's most sensitive nuclear weapons secrets. A small, reed-thin man tucked into a plain gray suit, Mr. Lee has sat in a federal courtroom here much of this past week seeking, for the third time since his arrest in December, to be released on bail. He is represented by a team of lawyers and one lioness who now gives speeches, raises funds for her father's defense, exhorts his lawyers, meets with civil rights groups and cajoles or browbeats reporters.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lee, who says she still cannot hold back the tears when she visits her father, says she is determined to do more than just see him exonerated. Because she and his supporters believe he has been singled out by the government because he is Chinese-American, she wants to use his case to fight against discrimination.</p>
        <p>Her determination has astounded those who know her.</p>
        <p>''There's a positive side to all this, how my sister sort of matured,'' said her brother, Chung Lee, 27, a soft-spoken medical student. ''I never would have imagined she could have done this. It's amazing, really.''</p>
        <p>Victor Hwang, the managing attorney of the Asian Law Caucus in San Francisco, a civil rights group that filed a brief supporting Dr. Lee's assertion that he is a victim of racial discrimination, said Ms. Lee has ''been one of the most interesting people to work with. She's the first person I've seen who has had this kind of growth. She's still in shock and denial, like, 'How can this happen?' But then she goes back and works very hard.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Lee described herself as a somewhat rebellious, emotional young woman while growing up in Los Alamos, sometimes more than her conservative father could handle. She recalled how once, when a friend showed up with torn jeans, her father was aghast and offered to patch them up right then and there. ''That's how conservative he is,'' Ms. Lee said. ''It also shows how, you know, clueless he is.''</p>
        <p>But while her father was in many ways a man of tradition who spoke Mandarin at home, Ms. Lee never had strong feelings about her Chinese heritage. She attended the University of California at Los Angeles, where she took a few courses on Asian-American history, but said they made little impression. ''I just felt that the problems with discrimination didn't apply to me,'' she said.</p>
        <p>It was only when her father became entangled in the criminal investigation that she began to see her ethnicity in a different way.</p>
        <p>She was working as a technical writer with a computer company in North Carolina, in late 1998, living with her boyfriend, now her fiance, when she started getting worried phone calls from her father and brother. Her father was being investigated, she was told. Suddenly she felt herself once again in the uncomfortably familiar role of family drama queen. She urged her father to get a lawyer, but was ignored.</p>
        <p>''My dad and I told her, 'Just chill out,' '' said her brother, Chung. ''I'd just be telling her she was overreacting.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Lee found the experience doubly painful. ''Maybe that's the theme of this whole story, that I had to fight my whole life for someone to listen to me in my family, even on this,'' she said. ''I don't mean to sound superbitter, but I feel that way.''</p>
        <p>ONCE her father's name surfaced, after officials said they suspected that he had given nuclear secrets to China, she found that not only were people listening, but that they eagerly sought her out. She gave her first speech on her father's birthday, last December, just a few weeks after he was arrested. Her real coming of age, she said, occurred a few months later, when she was asked to address a group of Asian-Americans at Harvard.</p>
        <p>''That was really when I realized you could make an impression on a crowd,'' she recalled. ''I really felt like, 'Now, I have a voice, I have a purpose.' I realized I wasn't just speaking for my father. I was speaking for Asian-Americans, too.''</p>
        <p>So now she is booked for speaking engagements through October, while still holding a job as a technical writer in San Francisco, and helping support some family members.</p>
        <p>''Honestly, I don't think she was viewed within the family as someone they would really listen to before this,'' said Brian Sun, the family's lawyer. ''But Wen Ho tells me now how proud he is. He just asks me to make sure she doesn't overdo her involvement. He wants her to have her own life.''</p>
        <p>As ever, Ms. Lee has her own ideas and is talking about becoming a civil rights lawyer.</p>
        <p>''She really believes her father's fate rests with her,'' Mr. Hwang said. ''She feels tremendous pressure. The main flaw I find in her is she hasn't developed much selectivity in who she will deal with. She won't let any opportunity go by without making the effort. I'm afraid she's going to burn herself out.''</p>
