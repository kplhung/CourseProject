        <p>The preliminaries of the women's United States Olympic gymnastics trials unfolded tonight with an early fall for a stunned but resilient Shannon Miller and with increasing signs of unease by those who wonder if personal preference will mean more than performance to Bela Karolyi.</p>
        <p>His is likely to be the loudest voice when the selection committee he leads meets Sunday after the finals of the trials at the Fleet Center and picks six members for the Olympic team. Although scores are factored in, they are not binding. Tonight, one of Karolyi's favorites, Miller, competed for the first time since shortly after she led the United States to a gold medal in 1996. She placed seventh in the preliminaries, well behind the overall leader, Elise Ray.</p>
        <p>During a mostly solid performance, Miller, 23, had one anguished moment. On a vault she has eased through many times, she fell on her backside when she landed. Miller regained her composure to hit her second vault for a total score of 8.893.</p>
        <p>''It was a freak thing,'' said Miller, who was unable to compete at the July nationals because of an injury. ''You have to be focused and not say to yourself, 'It's easy.' ''</p>
        <p>Miller finished the lowest among the three remaining members of the Magnificent Seven, who took the team gold in 1996. Amy Chow and Dominique Dawes showed improvement from the nationals, and both finished among the top six in the preliminaries.</p>
        <p>''I probably went down in Bela's eyes because I wiped out,'' said Vanessa Atler, who is in sixth place over all after she blew her dismount on the balance beam. ''I don't know what he's thinking. I don't think anyone is comfortable with the system. Man, if he doesn't like you, you're off the team.''</p>
