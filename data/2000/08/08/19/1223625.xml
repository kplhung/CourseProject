        <p>At least nine people were killed and dozens injured today as political protests swept across Mexico State, shattering the euphoria from last month's  elections and dashing hopes for a peaceful political transition.</p>
        <p>The protests erupted on Thursday in cities like Ecatepec and  towns like Huixquilucan as local party leaders in Mexico's most populous state clashed during ceremonies to swear in new mayors and town councils.

        <p>At least nine people were killed and dozens injured today as political protests swept across Mexico State, shattering the euphoria from last month's  elections and dashing hopes for a peaceful political transition.</p>
        <p>The protests erupted on Thursday in cities like Ecatepec and  towns like Huixquilucan as local party leaders in Mexico's most populous state clashed during ceremonies to swear in new mayors and town councils. But the worst demonstrations occurred today in this town 20 miles east of Mexico City between rival factions of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI.</p>
        <p>As supporters of the PRI mayor-elect, Jesus Tolentino Roman, gathered in the main plaza here for the ceremony, shots rang out. The state attorney general reported that at least 4 people had been killed and 40 others wounded.</p>
        <p>The violence, according to reports by witnesses, was started by armed followers of a local political boss, Guadalupe Buendia, who has coerced politicians in Chimalhuacan for years in support of the PRI. But last year when her choice for mayor lost in the PRI primary, Ms. Buendia turned against her party, leading protests that turned into riots outside the town hall.</p>
        <p>The state attorney general said  a warrant had been issued for the arrest of Ms. Buendia.</p>
