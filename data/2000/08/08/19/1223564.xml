        <p>Prosecutors sought to bolster their case today against a former Los Alamos scientist accused of mishandling nuclear weapons secrets by arguing that a visit to Beijing in 1988 had transformed him into a virtual spy for China.</p>
        <p>The government argument was the strongest statement to date that the scientist, Wen Ho Lee, was functioning as a spy, even though he is not charged with espionage.</p>
        <p>The government's aim in making these points, which came during testimony by an F.B.I. agent, appeared to be to impress the judge with the risks of releasing Dr. Lee on bail, as his lawyers are seeking.</p>
        <p>The defense countered that Dr. Lee had done nothing to conceal the meeting and that nothing classified had been discussed. Judge James A. Parker of Federal District Court expressed exasperation about the hearing's having lasted three days rather than the expected half-day.</p>
        <p>The F.B.I. agent, Robert Messemer, described an approved professional visit Dr. Lee made to Beijing in 1988 as highly suspicious. Dr. Lee has said that he was visited in his hotel room by two senior Chinese weapons scientists, Zheng Shaotang and Hu Side, and that he was asked about a mathematical problem related to nuclear weapons.</p>
        <p>Mr. Messemer said that the meeting typified standard Chinese spying maneuvers in a number of ways. It excluded other American scientists, including Dr. Lee's wife, and that Dr. Lee had been asked a fairly narrow technical question. In addition, the question was posed not by an intermediary, but by the scientist who might use the information.</p>
        <p>The government contends that Dr. Lee did not disclose this meeting at the time and only described what happened when he was interviewed by the F.B.I. early last year. But Mark Holscher, one of Dr. Lee's lawyers, countered that in an official report filed after the trip Dr. Lee mentioned he had met with Mr. Zheng and had not been questioned about the matter until last year.</p>
        <p>The judge did not announce his decision and indicated that he might not for several days so he could review the transcripts.</p>
