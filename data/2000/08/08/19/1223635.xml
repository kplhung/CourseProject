        <p>A New Jersey police officer shot and killed a man before dawn yesterday  after the man fired a gun at him during a search in woods in Hunterdon County, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>The shooting occurred while dozens of police officers were searching the woods for five men who had fled from a Clinton police officer who had stopped their car for a motor vehicle violation. Two men in the car fired shots at the officer, the police said, and the officer returned their fire.</p>
        <p>The car, a Plymouth Horizon with Pennsylvania license plates, was stopped about 3:40 a.m. on Route 513, south of Interstate 78 in Franklin Township. The police would not specify the violation the officer had stopped the car for.</p>
        <p>None of the officers were injured. The police would not release the names of anyone involved in the incident. They said they had not yet positively identified the men, but believed that they were from the Allentown, Pa., area.</p>
        <p>After the men fled from the car, the police, using dogs and a helicopter, searched an area at the juncture of Clinton, Franklin and Union Townships. A helicopter found three of the men in the woods surrounding the Hunterdon Developmental Center, a 600-patient institution for the mentally retarded. Officers found the fourth man, the car's driver, on a road behind a nearby Wal-Mart store.</p>
        <p>But the fifth man eluded capture until shortly before 6:30 a.m. As dawn was breaking, the helicopter spotted him in the woods in Union Township, about an eighth of a mile from the abandoned car.</p>
        <p>He was confronted by an officer from the State Department of Human Services assigned to the Hagedorn Gero-Psychiatric Hospital in nearby Glen Gardner. The officer told the man to freeze, the police said, and the man fired several shots at him. The officer fired back, the police said, striking the man. He was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
        <p>Investigators said it was not clear last night whether the dead man was one of those who had fired on the officer who had stopped the car.</p>
        <p>The authorities recovered one gun, said John Hagerty, a spokesman for the state police, but he said he could not reveal the make of the weapon or the number of shots exchanged because the investigation was continuing. The authorities said that when the men's car was stopped as it entered Franklin Township, the Clinton officer asked the driver for his license and registration.</p>
        <p>''The young man was unable to produce any identification, so the police officer asked him to get out of the car and then moved forward with a pat-down search for safety,'' Mr. Hagerty said.</p>
        <p>''It was at this point where the passenger jumped out and started to fire,'' Mr. Hagerty said.</p>
        <p>As the man ran away, Mr. Hagerty said, the driver, who had been facing the car, backed up suddenly and knocked the officer to the ground. He also shot at the officer before fleeing, the police said.</p>
        <p>''The police officer returns fire toward the passenger and the driver,'' Mr. Hagerty said. ''At the same time, the other three people get out and they start running.''</p>
        <p>He said the police did not know whether all the men had guns.</p>
