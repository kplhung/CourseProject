        <p>Immigration officials have delayed until next month a decision on whether to grant asylum to the leader of a Chinese spiritual movement after Chinese officials appealed for his return and submitted detailed charges that he raped followers, people involved in the case say.</p>
        <p>The movement's leader, Zhang Hongbao, has been held in detention in Guam since January after arriving in the American territory carrying a false passport, the people said.</p>
        <p>Last year, Beijing outlawed Zhong Gong, the quasi-religious group Mr. Zhang founded in 1987, along with several other groups that practice the Chinese meditation and exercise regimen known as qigong.</p>
        <p>While human rights groups say that Mr. Zhang has a strong asylum claim, American officials now have the delicate task of assessing the credibility of the Chinese charges.</p>
        <p>The Chinese authorities recently provided American officials with a list of alleged crimes, specifying dates and places and including testimony from followers who say that Mr. Zhang sexually assaulted them, people told of the charges said.</p>
        <p>The United States recently has tried to elevate cooperation with the Chinese police to fight international drug trafficking, making it difficult to dismiss Beijing's allegations without investigating them. Moreover, Mr. Zhang's group has attracted little international attention and does not fit common definitions of a political or religious movement.</p>
        <p>China in the past has brought charges of rape against people whom  it considers seditious, and American officials and human rights groups say the charges have in some cases proved unfounded.</p>
        <p>Immigration officials requested that an asylum hearing that had been scheduled for today be postponed until American officials weigh the validity of the rape charges. A new hearing is set for early September.</p>
        <p>The delay came shortly after Yan Qingxin, who says she is the No. 2 leader of Zhong Gong, was granted asylum. Ms. Yan, who is now in Washington seeking to generate support for Mr. Zhang, said she and Mr. Zhang arrived in Guam early this year to escape a Chinese dragnet and were thrown into detention with suspected smugglers. They waited six months to have their case heard.</p>
        <p>''We came to America because we thought that this country protects human rights,'' Ms. Yan said in an interview. ''But we are deeply disappointed to find that American courts do not treat such cases with urgency. I also fear that American officials are subject to pressure from the Chinese government.''</p>
        <p>Immigration and State Department officials said they do not comment on individual asylum cases. People involved in the case said the State Department was preparing an advisory opinion criticizing Beijing's suppression of Zhong Gong as politically motivated and noting the risk to Mr. Zhang if he returns to China.</p>
        <p>China began a crackdown on spiritual groups a year ago after followers of Falun Gong, another qigong group, organized a demonstration outside the Chinese leadership compound in Beijing. The authorities then banned Falun Gong and Zhong Gong, which are rivals.</p>
        <p>Unlike Falun Gong, which operates through autonomous cells with no clear hierarchy, Zhong Gong established an extensive organization with schools, healing centers, factories and printing houses.</p>
        <p>People who have studied the movement say it raised millions of dollars from school fees and the sale of medical goods, books and clothing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zhang tailored his teachings to the needs of China's poorest people. He said those who practiced Zhong Gong could fight cancer and heart disease more effectively than by taking drugs or undergoing surgery.</p>
        <p>Zhong Gong also says its leading practitioners have paranormal powers, including a ''thousand-mile eye'' that works like an X-ray and a telescope.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zhang first went into hiding in 1994 after criticism of his group grew. Ms. Yan said Mr. Zhang decided to seek asylum in the United States late last year after the Chinese authorities shut down Zhong Gong's schools and healing centers and detained staff members. She called the charges against Mr. Zhang ''sheer fabrication.''</p>
