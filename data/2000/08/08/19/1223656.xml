        <p>As they packed up their placards and headed home to where the hard work awaits, Democratic delegates and elected officials said today that they were confident that Vice President Al Gore had opened the minds of undecided voters with his convention speech on Thursday night, even if he might not have closed the sale.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's address had dual purposes: to mollify and energize party loyalists who have expressed concern about the centrist cast of the ticket, while also grabbing the attention of independent voters at home.

        <p>As they packed up their placards and headed home to where the hard work awaits, Democratic delegates and elected officials said today that they were confident that Vice President Al Gore had opened the minds of undecided voters with his convention speech on Thursday night, even if he might not have closed the sale.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's address had dual purposes: to mollify and energize party loyalists who have expressed concern about the centrist cast of the ticket, while also grabbing the attention of independent voters at home. In dozens of interviews, those who watched Mr. Gore from the floor said that he had clearly accomplished the first and had put himself in a position to compete with Gov. George W. Bush for swing votes.</p>
        <p>''I'm very excited,'' said David Giese, a 58-year-old delegate and small-business owner from Vermilion, Ohio. ''I can't wait to get home and spread the word.''</p>
        <p>The speech may have been short on memorable lines, but many said that Mr. Gore had succeeded in establishing his own persona, in subtly reassuring voters that he would not repeat President Clinton's mistakes, and in turning his focus on policy into an asset. Frustrated for months by the perception that Mr. Bush is simply more likable than Mr. Gore, they responded particularly well to Mr. Gore's assertion that ''the presidency is more than a popularity contest.''</p>
        <p>''There's been this nervousness among delegates,'' said Richard L. Brodsky, an assemblyman from Westchester County, ''because we've got the Republicans on the dead run on every single issue. Ask the American people who they agree with and they agree with us. Yet the campaign had the trappings of a race for president of the senior class.''</p>
        <p>A number of those interviewed also said that Mr. Gore seemed authentic and completely in control of his message. They said his image was softened by the lingering kiss he shared with his wife, Tipper, and they applauded his simple declaration of independence from Mr. Clinton: ''I stand here tonight as my own man.''</p>
        <p>''The world now knows he is not Bill Clinton,'' said Peter Zachos, 60, a delegate who is an airline mechanic from San Mateo, Calif.</p>
        <p>Gus P. Bickford, a 37-year-old delegate from Westford, Mass., said that Mr. Gore had established himself by laying out his agenda in such detail. ''I was into it,'' he said, ''because he was saying, 'These are my priorities; this is my candidacy.' And in a subtle way he was saying, 'I'm going to take you on, George Bush. You can run against the previous administration, but we're talking about the future here.' ''</p>
        <p>Many in the convention hall said that Mr. Gore seemed looser than usual, and that he had disarmed the critics of his sometimes robotic style by acknowledging that ''sometimes people say I'm too serious.''</p>
        <p>Bob Woodworth, a Democratic ward leader from Cleveland, said: ''In the beginning, he was way too fast. But he didn't have his usual quirks, the jerkiness of his body. He was very comfortable.''</p>
        <p>And yet there were those who, accustomed to Mr. Clinton's gift for connecting with his audience, felt that Mr. Gore still needed to show more emotion.</p>
        <p>''Some people can work a crowd,'' said Michael A. Schafer, the husband of a delegate from Mansfield, Ohio. ''He's not really that kind of guy. I just think he needed to space his wording and take in the applause and show a little fire with the subjects he touched on. He sounded like a good, wholesome man, though, and I think the country needs a good, wholesome man.''</p>
        <p>Members of the party's liberal base -- minorities, trade unionists, women, teachers -- were pleased that Mr. Gore took strong stands for affirmative action, abortion rights, and hate crimes legislation and against school vouchers and Mr. Bush's proposed income tax cut.</p>
        <p>''He made a concerted appeal to his base, and he did it in very, very specific terms,'' said Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr., a Chicago Democrat who had expressed concern this week about the ticket's centrist leanings.</p>
        <p>As for the undecided voters, the delegates here were convinced that Mr. Gore had started the process of reeling them in. His vows to protect Social Security, add a Medicare prescription drug benefit, take medical decisions away from health maintenance organizations, provide tax credits for college tuition, and reduce crime rates should all score, they said. ''The purpose of the speech was to open minds,'' Mr. Brodsky said. ''What he had to do here was begin the campaign, not clinch it.''</p>
