        <p>The Democrats appeared to be a slightly bigger draw on television in prime time during their convention this week than were the Republicans during their convention two weeks earlier. But the audiences for both events were down over all compared with 1996.</p>
        <p>And the Democrats' ratings may have been helped along by the simple fact that their convention received more minutes of network coverage in prime time than the Republican event did.</p>
        <p>Monday night through Thursday night, the coverage of the Democratic convention provided by both the cable and broadcast news outlets in prime time was watched in a combined average of 15.4 million homes, according to data compiled by Nielsen Media Research. That represented 28 percent of the homes watching television in prime time.</p>
        <p>The coverage of the Republican convention was watched in an approximate average of 14 million homes, or 26 percent of the homes watching television in prime time that week, according to Nielsen.</p>
        <p>According to a tally by the research department of NBC News, the Republican convention received 756 minutes of coverage on the broadcast networks during prime time while the Democratic convention received 902 minutes. Both political parties had fewer minutes of network attention in prime time than in 1996, when the Democrats were covered for 991 minutes and the Republicans were covered for 904.</p>
        <p>Before the conventions this year, there was an overall perception that the television audience would be less interested than in 1996. That, combined with a  sense that the conventions were staged to the point of being less interesting and newsworthy than in the past, had led news executives to debate heavily how much coverage they deserved.</p>
        <p>But, according to Nielsen figures, the difference in convention viewership between the two years was not at all stark. The Democratic convention was watched by about 5 percent fewer people in 2000 than it was in 1996. The Republican convention was watched by about 2 percent fewer people in 2000 than in 1996, according to the Nielsen data.</p>
        <p>Paul Friedman, the executive vice president of ABC News, said he believed that the conventions probably got about the amount of coverage, and the level of audience, that they deserved.</p>
        <p>''Maybe the way to look at it is that millions of Americans made the entirely logical conclusion that there is nothing to be decided and they have several months to make up their minds,'' Mr. Friedman said. ''They didn't feel it was necessary to invest time in watching well-packaged events when they have other ways of making up their minds.''</p>
        <p>ABC's coverage of the 2000 Democratic convention was watched by 4 percent more people than was its coverage of the 1996 convention, a clear indication of the strength of the network's hit game show, ''Who Wants to be a Millionaire,'' which has raised the network's overall ratings this year.</p>
        <p>For all of the major broadcast and cable outlets covering this year's Democratic convention, the biggest draw was Vice President Al Gore on Thursday night. His speech accepting the nomination for president was watched by about 21.8 million people. According to preliminary statistics, another 3.1 million watched the prime-time coverage of Mr. Gore's speech on PBS.</p>
