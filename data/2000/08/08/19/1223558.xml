        <p>One of the most famous corporate raiders of the 1980's and 1990's, Carl C. Icahn, has begun accumulating a stake in General Motors, the world's largest company, in a move that will increase pressure on the automaker to spin off its most valuable asset, Hughes Electronics.</p>
        <p>In a letter to G.M. Wednesday, Mr. Icahn said he intended to buy at least $15 million of the automaker's stock and up to 15 percent of its outstanding shares, G.M. said this morning. Federal antitrust laws require people who want to be active investors in publicly traded companies to provide notification if they begin acquiring stakes in that range.</p>

        <p>One of the most famous corporate raiders of the 1980's and 1990's, Carl C. Icahn, has begun accumulating a stake in General Motors, the world's largest company, in a move that will increase pressure on the automaker to spin off its most valuable asset, Hughes Electronics.</p>
        <p>In a letter to G.M. Wednesday, Mr. Icahn said he intended to buy at least $15 million of the automaker's stock and up to 15 percent of its outstanding shares, G.M. said this morning. Federal antitrust laws require people who want to be active investors in publicly traded companies to provide notification if they begin acquiring stakes in that range.</p>
        <p>Mr. Icahn has considerable resources for his latest foray: earlier this year he led a group of investors that forced the sale of Nabisco Group Holdings, pocketing a $600 million profit on an investment of roughly $400 million. While G.M. may be immense -- its sales of $176.6 billion last year exceeded those of any other company -- the total value of its outstanding shares was just $36.8 billion at the close of trading on Thursday, a reflection of the company's many troubles in the auto market.</p>
        <p>G.M.'s shares leaped $3 today after Mr. Icahn's stake was disclosed, raising the value of the company's stock to $39.4 billion.</p>
        <p>Some financial analysts said Mr. Icahn lacked the money to put heavy pressure on G.M. unless he found allies. A 15 percent stake would cost almost $6 billion.</p>
        <p>Toni Simonetti, a G.M. spokeswoman, said the company's board had been convened for a briefing on the financier's interest.</p>
        <p>Harry Pearce, G.M.'s vice chairman and former general counsel, spoke with Mr. Icahn briefly on Thursday. Mr. Pearce oversees G.M.'s stake in Hughes and typically handles big issues involving the company's financial strategy. Mr. Pearce declined to comment; Mr. Icahn did not return telephone calls.</p>
        <p>G.M. owns all the assets of Hughes Electronics and owns 33 percent of a tracking stock, the H Class of G.M. shares. Holders of the tracking stock share in the earnings of Hughes without owning the underlying assets. There have been repeated rumors this year that a big investor might try to buy G.M. to take control of Hughes, which owns DirecTV, the nation's most successful provider of satellite television.</p>
        <p>John F. Smith Jr., the chairman of G.M., pointed out in January that it would be difficult for a hostile bidder to acquire Hughes because G.M. could always spin the unit off if a takeover seemed imminent. Mr. Pearce, also a board member, said last December that, ''I seriously doubt the board is seriously worried that someone is going to acquire General Motors.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith said in the G.M. statement today that the company would continue its previously announced, $1.4 billion share-buyback program and would continue to review what to do with the company's stake in Hughes. G.M. repurchased 14 percent of its own shares by paying stockholders in Hughes tracking stock, the latest in a series of G.M. disposals of the tracking stock.</p>
        <p>G.M. executives have been reluctant to surrender control of Hughes because they see the automaker's future lying increasingly in the provision of high-profit services to people in cars and light trucks. The G.M. Onstar system for vehicles, which provides everything from navigational assistance to the location of hotels and restaurants, is already the leader in the auto industry, prompting Honda to adopt it and many other automakers to consider doing so. The Ford Motor Company recently announced plans to create a rival system.</p>
        <p>G. Richard Wagoner Jr., G.M.'s chief executive, told reporters at a conference two weeks ago in Traverse City, Mich., that G.M. would like such services to account for as much as a quarter of the company's revenue someday, but said that would be difficult because the company sells so many cars and trucks. A high-technology division accounting for a quarter of G.M.'s revenue would need twice the annual sales of the Microsoft Corporation.</p>
        <p>Institutional investors have been wary of holding an auto stock and impatient for G.M. to spin off its stake in Hughes to shareholders instead. Mr. Icahn has a track record of pushing such moves.</p>
        <p>''They all have their eyes on this,'' said Seth Glickenhaus, a senior partner at Glickenhaus &amp; Company, a New York money management firm that holds a small stake in G.M.</p>
        <p>G.M. is buying back stock now in part to offset the recent issuance of 5 percent of its stock to Fiat, in exchange for 20 percent of the Italian company's carmaking unit. Fiat is widely expected to vote the G.M. stock to support current management in any disputes because Fiat and G.M. are developing small cars together.</p>
        <p>Any hostile bid for G.M. would also be likely to encounter strong resistance from the politically influential United Automobile Workers union, which had no comment today. The U.A.W. and the Canadian Auto Workers signed contracts with G.M. last year, but either union could go on strike if a hostile takeover looked as if it might hurt their workers.</p>
        <p>While Canadian labor laws bar work stoppages while a labor contract is in effect, Basil Hargrove, the president of the Canadian union, said in an interview that he would not let that stop him from calling a strike, particularly if it looked as if Mr. Icahn were going to buy G.M. and sell any Canadian factories to help pay for the deal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Icahn is best known as the former chairman of Trans World Airlines. G.M. once indirectly owned a stake in T.W.A. but sold it in 1935.</p>
