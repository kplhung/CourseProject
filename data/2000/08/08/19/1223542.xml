        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Like It or Not, North Koreans Tour a Mall in Seoul'' (news article, Aug. 17): If both North and South Koreans are convinced of the potential of orchestrated reunions and shopping tours for reunification, they need to remember what happened to East Germany.</p>
        <p>In 1989, East Germany's last Communist leader, Egon Krenz, gambled that by allowing his people to visit West Germany, he could delay unification. His logic: after collecting the 100-mark allowance given by West Germany and shopping at the stores on Kurfurstendamm, East Germans would return home.</p>

        <p>In 1989, East Germany's last Communist leader, Egon Krenz, gambled that by allowing his people to visit West Germany, he could delay unification. His logic: after collecting the 100-mark allowance given by West Germany and shopping at the stores on Kurfurstendamm, East Germans would return home.</p>
        <p>Letting East Germans travel could dissuade West Germans who feared a potential refugee crisis. Of course, his plan failed miserably and Germany was unified sooner than many had expected.</p>
        <p>South Korea and its allies should start preparing. They may get what they wish, except too soon.</p>
