        <p>Trying to distance itself from a troubled past, Datek Online, one of the nation's fastest-growing online brokerage firms, has agreed to raise about $500 million to buy out the company's two majority shareholders, according to people who have been briefed on the deal.</p>
        <p>The company's board and top executives are trying to end Datek's relationship with Jeffrey A. Citron, the company's former chief executive, and Sheldon Maschler, a former trader with a history of regulatory problems. Together, they own about 52 percent of Datek.</p>
        <p>The two men, who may retain a minority stake, were instrumental in transforming what began as a small day-trading operation in Brooklyn into what is now the nation's sixth-largest online broker with more than $14 billion in customer assets.</p>
        <p>But continuing criminal and regulatory investigations into the company's day-trading operations during the 1990's have prevented Datek from offering shares to the public and have scared away many potential investors in Datek or its subsidiary, Island ECN, a popular electronic trading network.</p>
        <p>It is unclear whether the buyout agreement was prompted by any of the investigations. But people close to Datek's operations say that the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York and the Securities and Exchange Commission are still conducting investigations into Datek and its former day-trading unit, which was spun off in 1998 as Heartland Securities. Datek Online, the popular online trading unit, is not the focus of the inquiry, people close to the investigations say.</p>
        <p>Datek, which is based in Edison, N.J., hopes that by substantially reducing the stakes of Mr. Maschler and Mr. Citron, who will lose their voting power in the company, Datek can attract new investors and prepare for an initial public offering, people close to the deal said.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Datek issued a terse statement confirming that some buyout deal had been reached with Mr. Maschler and Mr. Citron. But a spokesman for the company, Robert O. Bethge, declined to elaborate.</p>
        <p>''We have entered into an agreement with the principal shareholders to seek to repurchase a substantial portion of their shares,'' the statement read.</p>
        <p>People who have been briefed on the deal, however, said that for more than a month top executives at Datek and representatives of the board had been in tense negotiations with Mr. Maschler and Mr. Citron about buying out their stakes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Maschler, who was sued in 1998 by the S.E.C. on accusations of playing a role in a stock manipulation scheme, now lives in Florida. Mr. Citron, who has also been fined by the S.E.C. for trading violations, lives in Brielle, N.J. Neither Mr. Citron not Mr. Maschler could be reached for comment.</p>
        <p>The two men agreed a few weeks ago to sell at least 75 percent of their shares to new investors, according to people close to the deal. The company is expected to find private investors willing to pay about $500 million for that stake, according to people who were briefed on the deal. The repurchase values Datek at about $1.1 billion. The company's investment banker is Credit Suisse First Boston.</p>
        <p>Datek, however, does not plan to pay for the deal with an initial public offering, people close to the deal say. But Datek officials have said publicly in recent months that they would like to move toward a public offering.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, the company canceled plans for an initial offering after the Manhattan district attorney's office said it was investigating whether Datek participated in a money-laundering operation and former Datek traders said they had been interviewed by the S.E.C. about questionable off-shore transactions and illegal trading practices at Datek's day-trading unit.</p>
        <p>Just more than a year ago, Vulcan Ventures, a venture capital fund controlled by Paul G. Allen, one of the co-founders of Microsoft, pulled out of a planned $100 million investment in Datek and Island ECN. People close to the deal said the withdrawal was partly because of concerns about investigations into the company. (TA Associates, a venture capital fund in Boston, and Groupe Arnault of Paris, proceeded with a $195 million investment.)</p>
        <p>Soon afterward, TD Waterhouse, the big online broker and a unit of Toronto Dominion Bank, decided not to follow through on plans to spend about $25 million for a 12 percent stake in Island ECN, which is seeking approval from the S.E.C. to become a full-fledged stock exchange.</p>
        <p>And last October, Mr. Citron, the 29-year-old chief executive at Datek, stepped down under pressure from other executives and investors in the company in a move Datek officials hoped would end some questions about the company's past.</p>
        <p>Though he kept a 30 percent stake in Datek, Mr. Citron agreed to turn over all his management and voting rights to the board. He also agreed to have no role at the company for two years, at which time Datek hoped investigations into its former day-trading unit would be resolved.</p>
        <p>Mr. Maschler has not had a role in the company since 1996, when as chief trader at Datek he was suspended for one year for trading infractions. But it was Mr. Maschler who went to Datek in 1987 and started building a day-trading powerhouse.</p>
        <p>In 1988, he hired Mr. Citron, who was 17, to work as a clerk in the office. Mr. Citron later became an enormously successful day trader -- using software the company created -- and then at the age of 26 became chief executive of Datek, which in 1996 transformed itself into an online broker.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Citron resigned last October after more than two years of revelations that the day-trading unit he was running had been under the scrutiny of authorities.</p>
        <p>Law enforcement officials are still scrutinizing Mr. Maschler and Mr. Citron's relationship to Robert E. Brennan, the penny stock promoter who was banned from the securities industry for life, and two weeks ago was arrested on charges of failing to report cashing in $500,000 of gambling chips after declaring bankruptcy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Citron and Mr. Maschler, who once worked for Mr. Brennan at First Jersey Securities, have each made financial deals with Mr. Brennan. Mr. Brennan borrowed about $3 million from a company owned by Mr. Maschler, according to files in Mr. Brennan's bankruptcy case. And Mr. Citron bought Mr. Brennan's mansion in New Jersey for $3.3 million in 1996 and his private jet for $3.8 million. Mr. Brennan recently traveled on a plane chartered through a company owned by Mr. Citron and his wife, according to court records.</p>
