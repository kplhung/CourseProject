        <p>Israeli, Palestinian and American diplomats are exploring the possibility of a new summit meeting to complete the peace negotiations broken off at Camp David last month. Despite political opposition in Israel, Prime Minister Ehud Barak has resolved to push for a final-status agreement with the Palestinians before his Parliament returns in late October.

Both countries warn that Islamic militants throughout the Arab world might react violently if sovereignty over any part of East Jerusalem is conceded to Israel.</p>

        <p>Israeli, Palestinian and American diplomats are exploring the possibility of a new summit meeting to complete the peace negotiations broken off at Camp David last month. Despite political opposition in Israel, Prime Minister Ehud Barak has resolved to push for a final-status agreement with the Palestinians before his Parliament returns in late October. The Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, hints encouragingly that he will postpone his threat to proclaim an independent state if no agreement is reached by Sept. 13. But a new summit meeting only makes sense if there is a realistic hope of breaking the impasse over Jerusalem that halted the Camp David talks.</p>
        <p>At that time, Israel was prepared to consider an American proposal that would have given the Palestinians control over parts of the Old City containing Muslim holy sites, along with some outlying Arab neighborhoods in East Jerusalem. But Mr. Arafat showed little interest, and was forcefully reminded by other Arab countries, particularly Egypt and Saudi Arabia, that anything less than full Arab sovereignty over East Jerusalem was unacceptable to them. Both countries warn that Islamic militants throughout the Arab world might react violently if sovereignty over any part of East Jerusalem is conceded to Israel.</p>
        <p>For any progress to be made at a new summit meeting, these American allies must take a more flexible position. Jerusalem is a highly emotive issue for Muslims, as it is among Jews. But this is a time for President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia to demonstrate leadership in the interest of regional peace.</p>
        <p>Assistant Secretary of State Edward Walker has just returned from two weeks of discussions with Arab leaders in which he sought their help in finding an acceptable compromise on Jerusalem. During the same period Mr. Arafat has been traveling to Arab and Islamic capitals, where he encountered little support for proceeding with his independence declaration in September. By deferring such a move, he can reduce the risks of new violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and allow more time for negotiations. High-level talks between Israelis and Palestinians resumed this week, assisted by the American mediator Dennis Ross.</p>
        <p>If there is to be a return to the summit, it should come within the next month or so. The Jewish High Holy Days begin at the end of September, quickly followed by the return of Israel's Parliament for its fall term. If no agreement is reached by then, Mr. Barak is sure to face renewed pressure from parties opposed to any further compromises with the Palestinians. Meanwhile, the Clinton administration's ability to broker an accord will fade as America's elections approach. Now is the time for the Palestinians and Israelis to concentrate on reaching an acceptable compromise on Jerusalem and sealing a final peace.</p>
