        <p>Turkey's decision to end a 34-year holdout and sign two United Nations conventions this week guaranteeing the social and political rights of minorities was greeted with tempered enthusiasm among the country's Kurds.</p>
        <p>Since 15 years of conflict between the army and Kurdish guerrillas ended last year, Kurdish leaders in southeastern Turkey have been looking to the government for progress on granting new rights to the region, including assurances that Kurdish can be spoken freely and that young people can be educated in Kurdish.</p>
        <p>Allowing the language to be used officially remains a sensitive issue for Turkey, and Parliament can attach restrictions to the conventions before ratifying them. But the government is intent on improving its human rights record in hopes of joining the European Union, and better relations with the country's 12 million Kurds is regarded as crucial, in part because the Kurds have vocal political allies in Europe.</p>
        <p>''Certainly it is a step of maximum importance for Turkey to sign these conventions,'' Serafettin Elci, a Kurdish political leader and former government minister, said. ''However, what usually happens here is that the implementing of the conventions doesn't take place. If they can manage to put these conventions into practice this time, it will help Turkey in bringing tensions down and in solving the Kurdish question.''</p>
        <p>The United Nations covenants date to 1966, and 130 countries have signed them. The signers agree to protect freedom of speech, adhere to restrictions on torture and forced migration, and promote economic and social rights of minorities.</p>
        <p>Volkan Vural, Turkey's ambassador to the United Nations, signed the agreements in New York and said they signified the importance Turkey attributes to human rights. Mr. Vural returns to a new post in Ankara next week to help oversee Turkey's effort to join the European Union.</p>
        <p>Turkey's Constitution does not recognize Kurds as a minority, defining them instead as Turks. The government has argued that they have the same rights as other citizens, while Kurds demand the right to use their language and culture to maintain an ethnic identity.</p>
        <p>The worst human rights abuses in recent years occurred in the predominantly Kurdish southeastern part of the country, where the army fought a brutal war with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party.</p>
        <p>Since the cease-fire last year, the state of emergency has been lifted in most of the region and police and military checkpoints have been relaxed. But human rights advocates said the authorities had refused to loosen the tight rein and Kurdish activists are still being arrested and tortured regularly.</p>
