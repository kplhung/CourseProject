        <p>Vice President Al Gore and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman took to the Mississippi today, weaving the river's epic symbolism into a populist challenge against the political influence of oil corporations, health maintenance organizations and drug companies.</p>
        <p>Before boarding the Mark Twain riverboat for a four-day, 390-mile journey down the Mississippi, Mr. Gore stood at the bank here and promised, as he had done last night in accepting the Democratic presidential nomination in Los Angeles, to make campaign finance reform his first legislative priority.</p>
        <p>''This reform measure is important because now the wealthy and powerful special interests have too much of an ability to stop good things,'' he told a crowd of roughly 5,000 people. Why, he asked, hasn't Congress increased the minimum wage, or passed legislation to provide free prescription drugs to the elderly? Why are ''bean counters'' at health insurance companies allowed to ''play God'' and overrule the judgments of doctors? In each case, he argued, action was blocked by corporate influence bought with huge campaign donations.</p>
        <p>''That's just morally wrong,'' he said of elderly people who cut back on groceries to pay for drugs ''when the drug companies have the highest profits of any industry.''</p>
        <p>To illustrate that this is a ticket of mainstream values -- and perhaps to erase images of this week's Hollywood hobnobbing -- the campaign is traveling down the Mississippi on a quaint 120-foot paddle boat draped with red, white and blue bunting. At today's kickoff event in La Crosse, an actor and Mark Twain look-alike took the stage to impart some homespun Twainisms. The La Crosse Coulee Chordsmen sang barbershop harmonies, and a high school marching band, the Onalaska Hilltoppers, played ''God Bless America.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman, along with their wives and several family members, boarded the Mark Twain to a blast from the boat's air horn and a final spray of confetti. As the riverboat pushed off, Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman stood at the stern, positioned just under an American flag for the photographers, and waved to the crowds on the banks.</p>
        <p>''Give 'em hell, Al!'' one man called out, and all along the roads that connect the small river towns on this part of the Mississippi, hundreds of people stopped their cars to wave and gawk and snap pictures. At one point this afternoon, as Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman led a somewhat stilted group discussion about Medicare on the riverboat's top deck, faint voices could be heard calling out from the distant river bank. ''Hi!'' Mr. Lieberman called back, ''Are there real people out there?''</p>
        <p>And Mr. Gore, mindful of the beating sun, said that he and Mr. Lieberman had been admonished by their wives to wear sunscreen. ''If any of you did not put sunscreen on, we have some available,'' he offered, adding that Senator John McCain, undergoing treatment for malignant melanoma, was in his prayers.</p>
        <p>With that, Mr. Gore returned to his aggressive criticism of the drug industry and health insurers, accusing them of reaping profits and hurting ''working families'' by erecting ''a mighty wall of resistance'' to prescription drug benefits and a patients' bill of rights.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore was joined in La Crosse by Russell D. Feingold, the Democratic senator from Wisconsin who, as a sponsor of the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill, is one of the Senate's loudest advocates for eliminating unlimited, unregulated donations from corporations and individuals.</p>
        <p>But for all the populist fire, neither Mr. Gore nor Mr. Lieberman mentioned the millions of dollars the Democratic Party raised in Los Angeles this week, much of that from major corporations. Nor did Mr. Gore mention his own prodigious fund-raising in the 1996 campaign, when he made dozens of telephone calls to corporate executives to solicit five-figure donations.</p>
        <p>At a rally today in Memphis, the Republican nominee, George W. Bush, charged that Mr. Gore was ''a little short on credibility'' when it came to campaign finance reform, and accused him of conducting ''class warfare'' for political gain.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore largely avoided direct criticism of Mr. Bush today. He called Mr. Bush and his running mate, Dick Cheney, ''honorable men,'' but then went on to suggest that their campaign was more about show than substance. ''I hope in the next two and a half months we can shift the focus away from sound bites and images,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman showed the effects of an exhausting week in Los Angeles. When the riverboat came upon a high school marching band waiting on the banks, Mr. Gore called over the public address system for them to play ''On Wisconsin,'' not realizing he was addressing Lansing, Iowa.</p>
        <p>Both candidates were having trouble with their voices, which were noticeably hoarse from speechmaking and lack of sleep. Mr. Gore sucked on lozenges, and Mr. Lieberman planned to get some extra rest after disembarking from the riverboat this evening to observe the Sabbath. He is expected to rejoin Mr. Gore on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore joked that he had taken extra rations of Diet Coke, and he was clearly determined to build from the momentum generated this week in Los Angeles. The candidates and their families flew out of Los Angeles long after midnight and landed here shortly after sunrise. They had time only to shower and change clothes before setting out for the river.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore is a fan of using metaphors to communicate big ideas, and he and his aides missed no opportunity today to turn his river excursion into a traveling parable of broad campaign themes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman evoked the river as an age-old symbol of journey. ''It has been a great thrill to be here on the banks of the Mississippi as we begin a journey across America, down this great American river which has inspired the American imagination and American dreams,'' Mr. Lieberman said. ''And that's what this ticket is all about.''</p>
        <p>There was, of course, old-fashioned political calculation behind the trip. The itinerary began in Wisconsin, a state long a hotbed of populist politics, and will take Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman through several important battleground states. River-bank rallies are planned in Dubuque, Iowa, and Moline, Ill., as well as Hannibal, Mo., the birthplace of Mark Twain, among other stops. Mr. Lieberman will not be at the Dubuque rally.</p>
        <p>''We're going to touch a lot of important communities in key states that often end up deciding presidential elections, and we're going to have a good time in the process,'' Mr. Gore said. And as if to prove the point, he and Mrs. Gore took turns today steering the riverboat.</p>
        <p>Told by reporters that some postconvention polls now showed him holding a slight edge over Mr. Bush, Mr. Gore played it cool. ''I don't put much stock in the polls, although they seem to be gaining in relevancy,'' he said, tongue in cheek. He nonetheless pronounced himself pleased with his speech last night -- ''I had a good time'' -- and Mr. Lieberman offered the opinion that it was the finest convention speech he had ever heard.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's daughter Karenna Gore Schiff spoke proudly of the long, lingering kiss her father had planted on her mother moments before his address.</p>
        <p>''They're like that,'' Ms. Schiff told reporters. ''There it is. It's out there. Some people may think it's a bit racy, but I'm used to it.''</p>
