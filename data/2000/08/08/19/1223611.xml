        <p>Congress conducted hearings in 1997 and 1998 on abuse of taxpayers by agents of the Internal Revenue Service, inviting self-proclaimed victims to testify how they had been harassed. The chilling anecdotes, orchestrated by Republican leaders to buttress their call for a less intrusive federal government, persuaded Congress to pass new taxpayer protections. A provision of the 1998 law calls for the mandatory firing of agents who commit any one of 10 specific abuses.</p>
        <p>Now comes the first report card on the legislation. Investigations by the agency and by an independent watchdog, the Treasury inspector general for tax administration, found that none of the first 830 complaints of taxpayer harassment filed under the 1998 statute could be substantiated. Some were bogus attempts to derail audits. Others were disproved or fell short of deliberate harassment. The surprising result suggests that the problem of rogue agents has been greatly exaggerated, with results that are clearly harmful.</p>

        <p>Congress conducted hearings in 1997 and 1998 on abuse of taxpayers by agents of the Internal Revenue Service, inviting self-proclaimed victims to testify how they had been harassed.

        <p>Now comes the first report card on the legislation. Investigations by the agency and by an independent watchdog, the Treasury inspector general for tax administration, found that none of the first 830 complaints of taxpayer harassment filed under the 1998 statute could be substantiated. Some were bogus attempts to derail audits. Others were disproved or fell short of deliberate harassment. The surprising result suggests that the problem of rogue agents has been greatly exaggerated, with results that are clearly harmful.</p>
        <p>The Congressional anecdotes never amounted to more than a handful of unsubstantiated claims of discriminatory treatment, such as criminal investigations launched against taxpayers whom agents deemed to be troublemakers. But studies conducted after the hearings have documented no pattern of abuse. The nonpartisan Government Accounting Office found the allegations made before Congress to be generally groundless. Similarly, the watchdog report finds no evidence of abuse after the law passed. The new law appears to have brought any rogue agents who might have existed into line. But there were probably not many to begin with.</p>
        <p>Congress's assault on the agency has been needlessly damaging. The I.R.S. budget has been cut 30 percent since the 1980's despite the steady rise in the number and complexity of returns. The 1998 law threatens retaliation against overzealous agents. No surprise, then, that enforcement efforts are shriveling. For high-income families, audits have fallen to around 1 percent, a 90 percent drop since 1988. Audits of large corporations have fallen by almost 40 percent since 1992. Seizures of property of delinquent taxpayers are down 98 percent. The danger is that lax enforcement will encourage cheating -- a problem that will not be noticed as long as the economy booms and tax revenues soar.</p>
