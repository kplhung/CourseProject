        <p>Two top-seeded teams suffered defeat at the American Contract Bridge League's Summer Nationals here  Thursday, and one of these results was an upset of historic proportions.</p>
        <p>In the Spingold Knockout, Roy Welland and Brad Moss, both of Manhattan, and Marc Jacobus of Las Vegas, Fred Gitelman of Toronto, and Magnus Lindkvist and Peter Fredin, both of Sweden, trailed by 26 imps at the midpoint against the defending champions.

        <p>Two top-seeded teams suffered defeat at the American Contract Bridge League's Summer Nationals here  Thursday, and one of these results was an upset of historic proportions.</p>
        <p>In the Spingold Knockout, Roy Welland and Brad Moss, both of Manhattan, and Marc Jacobus of Las Vegas, Fred Gitelman of Toronto, and Magnus Lindkvist and Peter Fredin, both of Sweden, trailed by 26 imps at the midpoint against the defending champions. These were Nick Nickell of Manhattan, Dick Freeman of Atlanta, Jeff Meckstroth of Tampa, Fla., Eric Rodwell of Naperville, Ill., Bob Hamman of Dallas  and Paul Soloway of Mill Creek, Wash. But a second-half surge gave Welland a remarkable 29-imp victory. It was only the second loss for Nickell in 52 matches.</p>
        <p>In the Women's Knockout, the top-seeded foursome led by Connie Goldberg of Merion Station, Pa., lost its semifinal match by 38 imps, but this was not a surprise. The winning Texas team of Joan Jackson, Petra Hamman, Robin Klar, Peggy Sutherlin, Mildred Breed and Shawn Quinn will represent the United States in world competition in the Netherlands in a week's time.</p>
        <p>In the final here today, the Texans meet Kathie Wei-Sender of Nashville, Betty Ann Kennedy of Shreveport, Ill., Juanita Chambers of Walpole, Mass., Jill Levin of Riverdale, the Bronx, Janice Seamon-Molson of Miami and Tobi Sokolow of Austin, Tex. The Wei-Sender team won the other semifinal by 35 against Cheri Bjerkan of Elmhurst, Ill., and her team.</p>
        <p>The most exciting match was in the Spingold, when teams led by Steve Robinson and Howard Weinstein finished in a tie. The Robinson foursome won a playoff that ended at 2:45 a.m., and will be weary today in quarterfinal play. The pairings by captain are: Welland against Richard Schwartz of East Elmhurst, N.Y.; Rita Shugart of Pebble Beach, Calif., against Rose Meltzer of Los Gatos, Calif.; James Cayne of Manhattan against Robinson; Grant Baze of La Jolla, Calif., against George Jacobs of Hinsdale, Ill.</p>
        <p>The diagramed deal contributed to the Welland team's third-quarter surge. In one room, Gitelman and Moss, East and West, punished their opponents for intervening. After West had raised hearts, North doubled for takeout. East's redouble showed strong defense, and South landed in three diamonds doubled.</p>
        <p>A trump lead was won by the ace, and South finessed the spade ten, losing to the jack. The diamond queen drove out the king, and another spade lead lost to the ace.</p>
        <p>West cashed the diamond ten and led a heart to his partner's ace. A heart to the ten forced out dummy's remaining trump. The club king was led and permitted to win. The defense was in full control, and South was down four for a penalty of 800.</p>
        <p>In the replay, Rodwell, East, reached three no-trump after an artificial sequence that did not tempt his opponents to enter the auction. A club was led, and Lindkvist, North, played the club king, a significant deceptive move. East now believed that the club length was on his left, and returned the club jack, aiming to establish a trick in that suit.</p>
        <p>North won the queen and returned a diamond, which was ducked. East thought he could cash five heart tricks and make his game, but failed by a trick when hearts did not break.</p>
        <p>Thanks to this fine defense, the Welland team gained 13 imps en route to its sensational victory.</p>
