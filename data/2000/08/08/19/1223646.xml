        <p>When he accepted the Republican presidential nomination in Philadelphia two weeks ago, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas skipped lightly over a few issues -- taxes, Social Security, education, nuclear weapons -- and then got to his topic sentence: ''We must usher in an era of responsibility.''</p>
        <p>In Los Angeles on Thursday night, Vice President Al Gore took the opposite approach. Declaring that ''the presidency is more than a popularity contest,'' he said, ''I am here to talk seriously about the issues.''</p>
        <p>And that he did, one issue after another, as if he were delivering a State of the Union address and not speaking to a political convention, so that by the time he finished, there could be no doubt where he stood on virtually every important matter before the federal government.</p>
        <p>He favors abortion and homosexual rights, affirmative action, gun control, a higher minimum wage and restrictions on marketing tobacco products. He opposes tuition vouchers for private school students and diverting Social Security taxes into private retirement accounts.</p>
        <p>On each of these issues, Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush are on opposite sides.</p>
        <p>And, as Mr. Gore pointed out, there is also a stark contrast in what may be the most important issue decided by this year's presidential election: how the government will use the budget surplus, projected by the Congressional Budget Office to be about $4.5 trillion over the next decade.</p>
        <p>Both candidates have agreed to earmark the $2.4 trillion in the surplus that will come from Social Security taxes to bolster the Social Security system. But they would do this in different ways.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore would use all this money to pay down the national debt, the theory being that this would improve the economy and make it easier to pay Social Security benefits after the baby boomers retire. Mr. Bush would use a big chunk of the Social Security surplus to cover the cost of creating private retirement accounts that would be invested in the financial markets.</p>
        <p>As for the rest of the surplus, Mr. Gore would spend most of it, and he described how in his acceptance speech: for universal health insurance for children, for prescription drug coverage under Medicare, for medical research, for hiring and training teachers and for environmental protection.</p>
        <p>He would also use a relatively small bit for specific tax cuts, mostly to make college tuition tax deductible, to modify the estate tax and to eliminate the tax penalty paid by some married couples.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, by contrast, would use most of the money not set aside for Social Security for across-the-board tax cuts: lower tax rates for taxpayers at every income level, tax breaks for all married couples regardless of whether they now owe a penalty and a complete elimination of the estate tax, which is owed only on estates worth more than $675,000.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush says he also favors prescription drug coverage for those on Medicare. But he has set no money aside for this initiative, which could cost $250 billion or more between now and 2010, depending on how generous the benefit is.</p>
        <p>In his speech, Mr. Gore derided the Bush tax plan. ''For every $10 that goes to the wealthiest 1 percent,'' the vice president asserted, ''middle-class families would get one dime. And lower-income families would get one penny.''</p>
        <p>''In fact,'' Mr. Gore went on, ''if you add it up, the average family would get about enough money to buy one extra Diet Coke a week, about 62 cents and change.'' (The text Mr. Gore was reading from said ''a Diet Coke a day.'')</p>
        <p>Those figures were developed by Citizens for Tax Justice, a labor-backed research organization. In 1999, the richest 1 percent of Americans were taxpayers with incomes over $319,000. The average income in this segment was $915,000, and the average tax cut under the Bush plan would be $46,072.</p>
        <p>Taxpayers with incomes in the middle 20 percent of all taxpayers (40 percent had higher incomes and 40 percent lower) had an average income of $31,100, and their average tax cut would be $453 (less than 10 cents for every $10 saved by the wealthy). By this reckoning, the daily tax cut would be $1.24 -- twice what Mr. Gore suggested, perhaps enough for a bag of chips with the Diet Coke.</p>
        <p>The poorest 20 percent of the population, those with incomes below $13,600 would get an average annual tax cut of $42.</p>
        <p>The Bush campaign accused Mr. Gore of missing the point. Under the tax plan, said Dan Bartlett, a campaign spokesman, a family of four making $35,000 would have its entire $1,500 tax bill wiped out. A family of four making $50,000 would have a tax bill of about $4,000 cut to about $2,000. And a family of four with an income of $75,000 would have a 25 percent cut, to about $7,500 from about $10,000.</p>
        <p>The Gore and Bush calculations are both accurate. The reason for the different emphases is that the Gore figures counted all taxpayers at particular income levels, single people as well as families. At middle-income levels, families would fare better under the Bush plan than individuals.</p>
        <p>Still, there is no dispute that the giant share of the tax cuts under the Republican proposal would go to the wealthy. The question is whether that is fair. Republicans say it is, since the wealthy are the ones who pay most of the taxes to start with. Democrats say it is not, since people that rich can afford what they are paying.</p>
        <p>For people who plan to vote for president in November on the basis of where the candidates stand on the issues, the choice will be a clear one. That is true not just on issues like abortion and gun control but also on the economy.</p>
        <p>Those who believe that the government should spend most of the surplus to provide better health and education programs will vote for Mr. Gore. And those who want to give the money back in tax cuts will vote for Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>Over the last eight years, Democrats have succeeded when they have been able to reduce the political debate to this binary choice between tax cuts and spending for popular programs. That is exactly what Mr. Gore was trying to do in his acceptance speech, and what Mr. Bush was trying to avoid in his.</p>
