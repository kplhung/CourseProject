        <p>When the Oxford English Dictionary decided to open a North American office this year to document the evolution of American English from  the thick of it, it engaged a young American lexicographer with impeccable credentials who also happened to be the author of a 288-page book on a certain unmentionable word.</p>
        <p>Jesse Sheidlower, known far beyond the anonymous world of dictionary-making as an energetic and accessible expert on neologisms and slang, now sits ensconced in a building in Old Saybrook, Conn., which the O.E.D. shares with a hearing-aid company and a dentist, and toils over how best to define terms like ''McMansion,'' ''chowhound'' and ''jiggy.''</p>
        <p>(As in ''gettin' jiggy wit' it.'')</p>
        <p>Mr. Sheidlower works mostly alone, but invariably attired in a suit, a formal man with a visceral distaste for casual Friday and other evidence of shifting standards of appropriate dress. He has nevertheless spent his career tracking with equanimity the ceaseless mutation of the American language, often into zones that its stuffier defenders have scorned.</p>
        <p>Nothing contradictory in that, he said recently.</p>
        <p>''You can be interested in slang or dialect or things that people call ungrammatical but still think that there is a formal way of speech,'' said Mr. Sheidlower, who has something impish about him that is reminiscent of a young Michael Palin. ''Our entire conversation has been conducted in a relatively formal standard English despite the fact that I know a lot of words that will make people's hair crawl.</p>
        <p>''Because that is what we do as intelligent adults in the sort of conversation we're having now: we use standard English. In the same way, I think it's terrific that they're making suits out there that don't have any --'' he paused, executing the rhetorical equivalent of a grimace ''-- sleeves, or whatever. But that's not what humans do.'' Humans wear suits with sleeves.</p>
        <p>In lexicography, Mr. Sheidlower is an unusually public figure. In addition to having written ''The F-Word'' (Random House, 1995), he was the project editor of ''The Random House Dictionary of American Slang,'' the originator of a ''Word of the Day'' feature on the Internet (http://www.randomhouse.com) and the author of ''Jesse's Word of the Day: From Abacinate to Yonic'' (Random House, 1998).</p>
        <p>He has written about language for periodicals ranging from The Atlantic Monthly to Dictionaries, the journal of the Dictionary Society of North America. He has served as the resident linguist on National Public Radio's ''Weekend Edition.'' He has written scholarly articles on such matters as the principles for the inclusion of new words in college dictionaries and the expression ''Not!'' (It antedates ''Wayne's World'' by a long shot. Theodore Dreiser, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Edmund Wilson used it.)</p>
        <p>''There is a kind of pixie-ish quality about Jesse, with his white shirt and bow tie in which he tells you things that he finds slightly embarrassing but he's sort of forced to tell you because it's all about words,'' said Richard W. Bailey, the vice president of the Dictionary Society of North America and a professor of English at the University of Michigan. ''It's as if every word had a closet and in that closet there are often skeletons. And Jesse has been there.''</p>
        <p>Asked over lunch to describe a word whose definition had been giving him trouble, Mr. Sheidlower recounted the difficulty he was having defining the phrase ''bitch-slap.'' Connotationally, it means to slap a person; specifically, it is to slap a person as a pimp would slap a prostitute. But, he said, one cannot use a simile in a definition.</p>
        <p>Can you bitch-slap a person anywhere or only in the face? he had wondered. With an open hand or the back of the hand? Can you bitch-slap a man or only a woman? Is it to hurt a person? No, it is to show social dominance. ''So all of these things have to be taken into account,'' Mr. Sheidlower said. ''And figuring out that this is what is going on takes thought and discussion.''</p>
        <p>Among colleagues, Mr. Sheidlower's age has been a subject of curiosity.</p>
        <p>''One of the mysteries, of course, is how old he is,'' said Mr. Bailey, who has known Mr. Sheidlower for 10 years but does not know the answer. ''I think there is a lot of wonderment and speculation about this, because he's been doing this work forever yet he looks as if he's 30. More people have said to me, 'How old is Jesse?' ''</p>
        <p>Thirty-two.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sheidlower grew up in the Five Towns area of Long Island, dreaming of astrophysics. His grandfather sold butterflies to collectors; his parents manufactured ant farms, rock tumblers and other science and nature toys. Intending to study science, Mr. Sheidlower went to the University of Chicago. Then he switched to classics and English.</p>
        <p>After graduating, he spent a year at Trinity College, Cambridge, studying early English in the department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic. He got a job in marketing at Alfred A. Knopf in Manhattan in 1991. Six months later, when a friend left the reference department at Random House, Mr. Sheidlower took his job and began his career in lexicography.</p>
        <p>The year before, while still at Cambridge, he had found what is known in lexicography as an important antedating -- the use of a word in a particular sense years before what was thought to have been the earliest usage. The word was ''tool,'' meaning to drive along a road. He found it in a letter written by Lord Byron in 1819, 13 years before the earliest example cited in the O.E.D.</p>
        <p>The example had gone unnoticed, Mr. Sheidlower said, because Byron had used it punningly, in a sexual sense, and a fastidious editor had euphemized it to ''fool'' in an early edition of Byron's letters. Mr. Sheidlower sent it to the O.E.D. and joined the dictionary's force of mostly volunteer readers, who comb publications for material and ship in their gleanings.</p>
        <p>At Random House one day, Mr. Sheidlower's boss happened to mention the slang dictionary project, languishing in a drawer because the project editor had died. Mr. Sheidlower took it on, and the first two volumes came out in 1994 and 1997. Then in 1999, when he learned that the O.E.D. would be opening a North American office, he applied for the job of principal editor.</p>
        <p>''He had a background in historical and modern lexicography, which is quite unusual,'' said John Simpson, the chief editor of the O.E.D., who hired him. He knew the history of English, Mr. Simpson continued, and the dictionary's distinctive style. He knew his way around computers, and was young and enthusiastic and personable enough to supervise the O.E.D.'s stable of North American readers.</p>
        <p>Since starting last spring, Mr. Sheidlower has been making an effort to include vocabulary traditionally neglected by the O.E.D., which has a reputation for covering literary language at the expense of what Mr. Sheidlower calls ''other registers.'' In his own reading and what he assigns, he has been mining sources ranging from the script for ''Clueless'' to a magazine about massage.</p>
        <p>Recent readings for the O.E.D.: ''Psychotic Reactions and Carburetor Dung,'' by the 1970's rock critic Lester Bangs; a collection of previously unpublished stories by Dashiell Hammett; ''The New New Thing: A Silicon Valley Story,'' by Michael Lewis; and the complete scripts from the first season of ''The Sopranos.'' (''This is really good stuff!'' Mr. Sheidlower exclaimed.)</p>
        <p>One of his readers, a Minnesota stevedore who specializes in historical reading, has been scouring the journals of the Lewis and Clark expedition. A lawyer in Texas specializes in black folklore and late-19th- and early-20th-century Texas folklore. Others can be found reading all sorts of publications -- Wooden Boat, The Jewish Bakers' Voice, magazines about model railroads and aromatherapy, regional daily newspapers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sheidlower not only manages the reading program and reviews existing O.E.D. entries for American content but also drafts entries for the O.E.D.'s new electronic third edition. As a rule of thumb, the dictionary requires at least five examples of a word or usage from three different printed sources over about three years before it considers drafting an entry.</p>
        <p>In recent months, Mr. Sheidlower has worked on entries for ''whack,'' meaning to kill; ''blunt,'' meaning a cigar stuffed with marijuana; ''Juneteenth,'' the African-American holiday; ''Perl,'' the computer language; and ''porn,'' referring not to pornography but to any source of obsessive, voyeuristic interest, like magazines about expensive houses (''shelter porn'') or food pictures (''gastro porn'').</p>
        <p>He is tracking the use of ''so'' as an adverbial intensifier meaning ''extremely,'' but in cases that do not normally take comparison, as in ''so 1995'' or ''We are so out-of-here.'' He also serves as an invaluable scout on the front lines of American usage for the dictionary's six other top editors, all of whom are back in Oxford.</p>
        <p>After the editors decided against including ''master of the universe'' in the third edition on the grounds that it had little currency independent of Tom Wolfe, Mr. Sheidlower convinced them otherwise. He challenged an intended definition of ''mailbox,'' which in England means simply a box for sending out letters but in America means both that and a box in which letters are received.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't clear,'' Mr. Sheidlower recalled. ''They were mashed together and they needed to be disambiguated.''</p>
        <p>Disambiguated? a visitor asked. That's a word?</p>
        <p>''Yes,'' Mr. Sheidlower said without a second's hesitation. ''Mostly used in computational lexicography. But it's a word.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 30, 2000, Wednesday  A front-page article on Aug. 19 about Jesse Sheidlower, who heads the North American office of the Oxford English Dictionary, misstated one of his publishing credits. He was the editor of the book ''The F-Word,'' not its author. The article also omitted part of the title of the reference work from which that book was largely derived.
