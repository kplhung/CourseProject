        <p>The commander of Russia's Northern Fleet acknowledged that a terrible internal explosion devastated the nuclear submarine Kursk before it went down last Saturday, confirming Western intelligence reports of huge underwater explosions.</p>
        <p>The report came as the Russian navy finally docked a rescue vehicle on the wrecked submarine after numerous unsuccessful attempts. But rescuers said they found the area around a rear hatch so damaged that they were unable to make a water-tight connection and enter the sub.</p>
        <p>Russian military officials said they would keep trying, and there remained the possibility that a British submersible, which is arrive tonight, might succeed with a more flexible docking mechanism.</p>
