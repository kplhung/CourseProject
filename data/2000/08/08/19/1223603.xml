        <p>After a visit to the birthplace of the women's suffrage movement, Representative Rick A. Lazio challenged  Hillary Rodham Clinton on one of her core issues, women's health care, igniting a battle over which candidate had done more about breast cancer prevention.</p>

        <p>After a visit to the birthplace of the women's suffrage movement, Representative Rick A. Lazio challenged  Hillary Rodham Clinton on one of her core issues, women's health care, igniting a battle over which candidate had done more about breast cancer prevention.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, the Republican Senate candidate, has said all along that he would court constituencies and speak on issues not normally identified with Republicans, but his attack today showed an aggressive attempt to seize an issue Mrs. Clinton has promoted. It also illustrated the opportunity his strategists see to attract women voters, some of whom, according to recent polls, were not backing Mrs. Clinton as strongly as had been expected.</p>
        <p>''When they have a record on education or health care, it's a horrendous record of undermining women's health, particularly on life-threatening diseases like breast cancer,'' Mr. Lazio told reporters shortly after a visit to the Women's Rights National Historic Park in Seneca Falls, where in 1848 the suffragist Elizabeth Cady Stanton and other activists met to lay the foundation of the women's rights movement.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, on a statewide bus tour that also brought him to this village for a tour of downtown, said Mrs. Clinton fell short on advocating mammograms for the early detection of breast cancer.</p>
        <p>He said Mrs. Clinton's health care reform plan of 1993-94 did not include provisions to allow women under 50 with no health insurance and at higher risk of contracting the disease to receive the exams. But Mrs. Clinton's staff immediately replied that  Mr. Lazio had overlooked an amendment to the plan that did include such a provision. At the time, the recommended age was a matter of dispute among doctors, but by 1997 the American Cancer Society suggested women start receiving them at 40.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton said in an interview with The New York Times last week that in 1998 she pushed for legislation that would allow Medicare patients 40 and older to receive the exams, a response to the American Cancer Society's recommendations. The legislation passed and was signed into law in February of that year.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Lazio, who said he had supported legislation for several years advocating the exams beginning at 40 or sooner, seized on what he considered the discrepancy between Mrs. Clinton's health care proposal and her remarks in the interview as evidence that she was not a strong advocate for the issue and could not be trusted.</p>
        <p>''That's the difference between these two camps,'' Mr. Lazio said. ''I say what I mean. I can back up my speech, my comments, with the truth, with the facts, with a record. What they say is always suspect.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's campaign called Mr. Lazio's claims a ''joke'' and noted that the National Breast Cancer Coalition, a leading advocacy group on the issue, had honored Mrs. Clinton this week for her work promoting breast cancer prevention and treatment, one of several awards it has given the first lady. (Mr. Lazio has received two awards from the organization in the last year, a spokeswoman for the coalition said.)</p>
        <p>''Who will New Yorkers believe, the National Breast Cancer Coalition or Rick Lazio?'' said Howard Wolfson, Mrs. Clinton's chief spokesman. He asserted that Mr. Lazio, as a Suffolk County legislator a decade ago, voted for bills that depleted resources for women's health and advocacy programs.</p>
        <p>The squabble highlighted a recurring theme for Mr. Lazio. He seeks to emphasize his legislative record as an advantage over Mrs. Clinton, who has never held elected office but who contends she has functioned as a virtual senior adviser to President Clinton on various bills. But Mr. Lazio's legislative record has also provided Mrs. Clinton and Democrats a tool to use against him.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Lazio released an advertisement this week promoting his record, Democrats, in Los Angeles for the national party convention, held a news conference to denounce him and claim he had taken too much credit for some bills and had ''hijacked'' credit from Democratic lawmakers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio and Democrats have disputed credit for the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act, which would provide financing for women too poor to afford insurance but earning too much to qualify for government health care. The bill, which passed the House, is awaiting action in the Senate. It has bipartisan sponsors, including Mr. Lazio, but Representative Anna Eshoo, a California Democrat, has said Mr. Lazio speaks as if he were the sole sponsor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio today called the bill one of his achievements on women's issues.</p>
