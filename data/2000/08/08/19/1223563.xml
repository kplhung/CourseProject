        <p>After four days of giving a national television audience a generally positive look at itself and its candidates, the Democratic Party turned today to how to attack the Republicans and Gov. George W. Bush on a variety of issues, with a heavy emphasis on abortion.</p>

        <p>After four days of giving a national television audience a generally positive look at itself and its candidates, the Democratic Party turned today to how to attack the Republicans and Gov. George W. Bush on a variety of issues, with a heavy emphasis on abortion.</p>
        <p>At a raucously enthusiastic meeting of the Democratic National Committee, the party's general chairman, Edward G. Rendell, said, ''This was a nice, upbeat convention, and it was the right thing to do.''</p>
        <p>Then Mr. Rendell denounced Republicans for the ''fraud'' of saying they were ''inclusive'' and ''compassionate.''</p>
        <p>On abortion, he said that Mr. Bush would replace retiring Supreme Court justices who supported abortion rights with judges hostile to abortion and that ''very soon, Roe v. Wade will be voted out.'' Then, he said, ''dozens of state legislatures will pass laws prohibiting abortion.''</p>
        <p>That warning was seconded by Carol M. Browner, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, who was applauded for telling the committee, ''As a woman, I don't want anyone telling me what I can do with my body.''</p>
        <p>Mayor Dennis Archer of Detroit said a victory by Vice President Al Gore was necessary to ''preserve a woman's right to choose.''</p>
        <p>Other lines of attack were suggested, too.</p>
        <p>Donna Brazile, Mr. Gore's campaign manager, said Mr. Bush had nothing to offer to the ''poor in America without health insurance.'' The Rev. Jesse Jackson ridiculed Republican efforts to make it appear that African-Americans were a significant part of their party by using ''workers from concession stands sitting in delegates' seats at the G.O.P. convention in Philadelphia.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rendell said Democrats had to remind voters that while Mr. Gore wanted a prescription drug entitlement under Medicare and available to all elderly Americans, Mr. Bush had a plan that would only cover a third of them. ''We should carry Pennsylvania and Florida on this issue alone,'' Mr. Rendell said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Browner also hit the prescription drug issue and then attacked Mr. Bush over the environment. She said Houston had become ''the most polluted city in the country'' because Mr. Bush had chosen not to spend money on the environment, with Texas ranking 49th in environmental spending per capita.</p>
        <p>Mr. Archer, urging efforts to elect Democrats to the House and Senate, accused Republicans of blocking confirmation of black judges and for general opposition to affirmative action. He recalled what he said was the hostility to civil rights of the Reagan administration's assistant attorney general for civil rights, William Bradford Reynolds.</p>
        <p>Because of those memories, he said, ''it scares me when people like George W. Bush and Dick Cheney have every opportunity to become president and vice president.''</p>
        <p>The messages on how to attack the Republicans were interspersed with instructions to work hard and unite. Mr. Jackson said the time was past for Democrats to fight each other. He said two congressmen who held a news conference to complain that they had not been seen on television when their state cast its votes on a roll call were forgetting it was ''Super Bowl time,'' when only Republicans should be blocked and tackled. He also said Republicans and reporters were seeking to drive a wedge between Jews and blacks in the party.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jackson said that a few blacks may have criticized Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the vice-presidential nominee, and that they had to be answered, but that they amounted to ''a tree leaf, not a tree.''</p>
        <p>Blacks, Mr. Jackson said, had not kept Jews off national tickets or out of country clubs.</p>
        <p>''The argument about the black-Jewish thing is a diversion,'' he said.</p>
        <p>And every speaker called for all-out efforts. Joe Andrew, the party's national chairman, urged the committee members to always ''lick an extra envelope, make an extra phone call, pick an extra pocket.'' Ms. Browner urged efforts to get women to vote.</p>
        <p>And the Rev. William Smart, a former committee staff member who now serves as an African Methodist Episcopal minister, offered an invocation that concluded, ''Lord God, let the Democrats be elected.''</p>
