        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has chosen a new police commissioner, but as of yesterday afternoon, he was keeping the choice to himself, putting off the announcement until this morning to give the departing commissioner a final day of recognition.</p>
        <p>The mayor, walking up the stairs of City Hall after a farewell gathering for Commissioner Howard Safir at police headquarters, said that even the candidate he had settled on was not yet aware he had been chosen.</p>
        <p>''The attention should really go to Howard today, and then tomorrow we can announce the new commissioner,'' the mayor said, noting that yesterday was Mr. Safir's last official day of work. ''The city is going to miss him as a police commissioner, and I'm going to miss him as a friend, because I have worked with Howard for 25 years.''</p>
        <p>The mayor, in the brief exchange with reporters, twice declined to explain how he had finally come to his decision. He acknowledged it had been a difficult process over the last two weeks because of what he called the highly talented list of candidates.</p>
        <p>The mayor has indirectly confirmed that the candidates included Joseph P. Dunne, the chief of department, Bernard B. Kerik, the Department of Correction commissioner, and Dennison Young Jr., Mr. Giuliani's longtime friend and counsel. City Hall officials said at least two women were also considered for the job, but the mayor's press office would not reveal their names.</p>
        <p>The only details Mr. Giuliani offered yesterday were that he made up his mind on Thursday and that the winning candidate was a man. ''It just all of sudden occurred to me that this was the right person and that it would work,'' the mayor said.</p>
        <p>As for Mr. Safir, he started his last weekday as police commissioner with a 45-minute workout on the Nordic Track while he channel-surfed through the morning news programs on television. He arrived at the office before 9 a.m., met with visiting DNA experts and then set off for the first of the day's three ceremonies, on the pier beside the U.S.S. Intrepid.</p>
        <p>At a police appreciation ceremony at the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum, Mr. Safir received a plaque fashioned out of a plank from the ship's old wooden flight deck. He seemed cheerful, sidling up to a police officer's horse and giving it an affectionate pat, then heading over to pet a police German shepherd.</p>
        <p>''We are in debt to you, Commissioner Safir, for improving our quality of life,'' said Martin R. Steele, the museum's president and chief executive.</p>
        <p>In a small ceremony in his office at 11 a.m., Mr. Safir appointed his final honorary police commissioner: Donald J. Trump. ''I think people see that crime is at an all-time low,'' said Mr. Trump, who befriended Mr. Safir through the Police Athletic League. ''When crime is at an all-time low and you're the police commissioner, nothing further needs to be said.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Trump said he did not raise the issue of Mr. Safir's successor. ''I didn't feel it was appropriate to ask,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Safir ate lunch at home with his wife, then returned to 1 Police Plaza for a ceremony concluding the Exploring Academy program for teenagers interested in law enforcement. At a daily meeting of top staff members, Mr. Safir's chiefs and deputy commissioners surprised him with a chocolate cake with bananas and strawberries, topped with white frosting and the message, ''The finest of the finest: Congratulations, your staff.''</p>
        <p>A promotion ceremony at police headquarters was the setting for Mr. Safir's farewell address, a brief speech in which he said crime had been reduced and the city was safer on his watch. ''The last four years have been the most successful in the history of the N.Y.P.D. and, consequently, the most successful in the history of New York City,'' Mr. Safir said. ''Because of your hard work, your ingenuity and your sacrifice, the New York City of today barely resembles the New York City of four years ago.''</p>
        <p>Speaking to reporters afterward, Mr. Safir minimized the controversies that have marked his tenure, most recently the fatal shooting of an unarmed man, Patrick M. Dorismond. ''There are probably a hundred things I would have done differently, but on balance I'm very pleased with what I've done,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Asked what advice he would offer his successor, Mr. Safir said with a smile, ''First, get along with the mayor.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''Most importantly, care about your cops, care about the city and follow your own mind. Make your own path; don't follow others.''</p>
        <p>As the Emerald Society Pipe Band played and top chiefs lined up, Mr. Safir left 1 Police Plaza. He was whisked through the rain to the New York Stock Exchange, where he rang the closing bell.</p>
