        <p>Some Adirondacks getaway! Hillary Rodham Clinton barely had enough time to unpack her bags at the lakeside home where the first family is spending the weekend before she was off to a political rally to talk up her Senate bid.</p>
        <p>''There's no reason why one of the most beautiful places in the entire country can't also be one of the most prosperous places,'' Mrs. Clinton told more than 1,000 supporters who crowded into an ice-skating rink to see her, President Clinton and their daughter, Chelsea, on the first day of their vacation.</p>
        <p>The campaign rally, organized by the Democratic leaders in Essex, Franklin and Clinton Counties --  Mrs. Clinton said one county was  particularly well-named -- took place before the Clintons had hiked a single trail or fished for a single trout. But aides said the Clintons planned to spend Saturday in seclusion, celebrating Mr. Clinton's 54th birthday, and would be taking in the natural beauty of the mountains -- at least until Mrs. Clinton leaves on Sunday for a parade in Buffalo.</p>
        <p>In taking their vacation here, the Clintons chose solid Republican territory. Democrats are outnumbered three to one in some areas, and the evidence is displayed on front lawns all around, where signs backing Representative Rick A. Lazio appear to greatly outnumber those for Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>For all the charms of the area, locals realized that there was a political dimension to the Clintons' weekend stay. Some attributed the selection to a disparaging remark that an adviser to Mrs. Clinton's campaign made last year to The Daily News. The unnamed adviser ruled out a trip by the Clintons to the ''fly-infested Adirondacks'' because it would be seen as a blatantly political act. Locals were not thrilled with the snipe.</p>
        <p>''That's why she's here,'' said Richard A. Wild, an environmental analyst with New York State from the town of Franklin. ''She was worried that the fly remark would bite her.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wild's wife, however, preferred to think that the Clintons' motives were less calculated. ''This is a beautiful area and I think they came to enjoy the lakes and play some golf,'' said Carol A. Wild, who waited in a long line for barbecue before Mrs. Clinton spoke.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Wild was insistent. He noted that the Clintons arrived just weeks after the annoying black flies that plague the region during the summer months had largely disappeared.</p>
        <p>''We do have a fly problem,'' he acknowledged, describing how the pests gouge the skin and cause awful itching. ''But it's just part of the year. She shouldn't have a problem while she's here.''</p>
