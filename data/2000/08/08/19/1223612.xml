      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial opposes counter-narcotic aid to Colombia without certification that its armed forces meet certain human rights criteria; says US will be financing, training and backing a military with a record of killing civilians, aiding brutal right-wing paramilitary groups and defying a well-meaning but weak civilian government (M)</p>

        <p>The Clinton administration is poised to begin sending hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to Colombia's military. But first it must either certify that that nation's armed forces meet certain human rights criteria or waive those requirements in the interests of national security. Washington will probably grant the waiver to get counter-narcotics aid flowing, arguing that Colombia's armed forces will soon begin to clean themselves up. This is dangerous, wishful thinking. A stream of new helicopters, American training and logistical support given without preconditions will remove any incentive for the military to begin respecting civilians. The United States will be financing, training and backing a military with a record of killing civilians, aiding brutal right-wing paramilitary groups and defying a well-meaning but weak civilian government.</p>
        <p>Colombia's record on punishing or prosecuting military personnel for human rights abuses is poor, as the State Department acknowledges in its annual human rights report. There is evidence of military collusion in paramilitary massacres of peasants.  Carlos Castano, a paramilitary leader and admitted drug trafficker, appears on television, but the military seems unable to find and arrest him. High-ranking officers credibly accused of helping the paramilitaries remain in their jobs.</p>

        <p>Colombia's record on punishing or prosecuting military personnel for human rights abuses is poor, as the State Department acknowledges in its annual human rights report. There is evidence of military collusion in paramilitary massacres of peasants.  Carlos Castano, a paramilitary leader and admitted drug trafficker, appears on television, but the military seems unable to find and arrest him. High-ranking officers credibly accused of helping the paramilitaries remain in their jobs.</p>
        <p>While Colombia's guerrillas have a reprehensible record of killings, kidnappings and drug trafficking, the sudden escalation in American support for the military is not the answer. It will only strengthen the guerrilla hard-liners, intensify a conflict that neither side can win, and wreck the peace process between the government and the guerrillas, which offers the only possible hope of an end to Colombia's endless civil war.</p>
