        <p>Negotiators for more than 86,000 striking telephone workers and Verizon Communications reached tentative agreement on several critical issues yesterday, but an overall settlement to the 13-day walkout remained bogged down in the details.</p>
        <p>Morton Bahr, president of the Communications Workers of America, and Lawrence T. Babbio Jr., Verizon's president and co-chairman, worked through the early morning hours and into the day in a bargaining session that left both men and their associates weary-eyed yet satisfied, people close to the talks said.</p>
        <p>Among the issues Mr. Bahr and Mr. Babbio agreed on were limits to the movement of work resulting from the merger of Bell Atlantic and the GTE Corporation, which created Verizon, and the broadening of an agreement to organize employees of Verizon's wireless division, the people close to the talks said.</p>
        <p>Verizon agreed to move less than 1 percent of its employees each year to other places using criteria based on the geographic location of the workers and not the net total of its work force -- an important concession to one union demand, people close to the talks said.</p>
        <p>And a tentative agreement reached last week that would make the organizing of wireless workers easier in the 12-state region affected by the strike would also potentially ease the organizing of several hundred employees in Verizon Wireless retail stores, according to people close to the talks.</p>
        <p>Yet while Verizon and the unions reached broad agreement on some important issues, it seemed late yesterday that the minutiae of a deal was slowing negotiations.</p>
        <p>''A lot of progress has been made, but there is a consensus process that needs to be carried out for a comprehensive agreement to be reached,'' said Jeff Miller, a spokesman for the communications workers' union, which represents about 72,000 striking employees.</p>
        <p>Before the strike is settled, about 35 people on the bargaining committee of the communications workers' union need to sign off on high-level negotiators' progress. And the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which represents more than 14,000 workers, needs to ratify its own agreement.</p>
        <p>Both unions could reach an agreement with Verizon at different times, possibly prolonging the strike for some workers, although this is unlikely, representatives from both unions said.</p>
        <p>Verizon, meanwhile, tried to deal with delays in repairing and installing telephone service and with vandalism that has interrupted phone service for thousands of Verizon customers since the strike began. In addition, hundreds of thousands of consumers were inconvenienced yesterday by a technical failure at Verizon.</p>
        <p>About 11:35 p.m. Thursday, a complex piece of communications equipment that helps connect Verizon's local network to the long-distance systems of other companies failed at a Verizon site in Rochelle Park, N.J. Until about 12:20 p.m. yesterday, several hundred thousand of Verizon's local phone customers in New Jersey, mostly in Bergen County, but also in Passaic County, were unable to make long-distance calls.</p>
        <p>Tens of thousands of AT&amp;T's wireless phone subscribers in New Jersey and in parts of New York City, suffered a more severe problem: the inability to make any calls at all. In the Northeast, AT&amp;T uses Verizon's land-based communications network to link the various antennas used for wireless calls. The Rochelle Park failure, which began in a circuit card that controls complicated timing sequences, disrupted AT&amp;T's wireless system.</p>
        <p>A Verizon spokesman said that no unionized workers were in the Rochelle Park site at the time of the failure and that the problems were technical.</p>
