You are thankful that the New-York Historical Society has clung to its hyphen. So when out-of-town visitors come to stay on your couch, they are confident that you can answer all their questions.</p>
        <p>But then one evening you are leading the tourists along Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village when you come to a small triangle named Father Demo Square. Your guests ask who Father Demo was. Although you can momentarily distract them by pointing out that many of the city's ''squares'' are really triangles, it quickly becomes apparent to your guests that the Good Father's story has you stumped.</p>
        <p>The Parks and Recreation Department is coming to your rescue. It is in the middle of a two-year project to put up biographical and historical signs in every park. (The completed biographies can be found through www.nyc.gov/parks, by clicking on ''Your Park'' and then ''Historical Signs.'') Following are excerpts from some of the park biographies for Manhattan.</p>
        <p>ANNE CRONIN</p>
        <p>Father Demo Square</p>
        <p>0.07 acre at Bleecker Street  and Avenue of the Americas</p>
        <p>Father Antonio Demo (1870-1936) was born on April 23, 1870, at Lazzaretto di Bassano in the province of Vicenza, Italy. . . . Father Demo immigrated to Boston to do missionary work in 1896 and arrived in New York to serve as assistant pastor of Our Lady of Pompeii a few years later. In 1900, he was appointed pastor of the church, whose magnificent Italianate building stands northwest of the park at the corner of Bleecker and Carmine Streets. . . .</p>
        <p>In addition to serving as a spiritual counselor to his parishioners, Father Demo was active in social services, translating documents and conversations, finding jobs, making loans, aiding in the immigration process and writing personal recommendations. . . .</p>
        <p>In 1923, Father Demo learned that Sixth Avenue (now the Avenue of the Americas) was to be extended from West Third Street south to Canal Street. . . . Our Lady of Pompeii's building stood in the middle of the proposed street bed of Sixth Avenue. Father Demo organized the campaign to buy another property and to build a new church, rectory and parochial school. . . . The cornerstone of the new building was laid on Oct. 3, 1926, and the church was dedicated two years later, on Oct. 7, 1928. . . .</p>
        <p>He died in 1936 in New York, and thousands of parishioners and friends, including Mayor Fiorello La Guardia, paid their respects to their beloved pastor.</p>
        <p>McCarthy Square</p>
        <p>0.04 acre at Seventh Avenue South  and Waverly Place</p>
        <p>Not until the 1910's and 1920's were Seventh and Eighth Avenues extended south of 14th Street. As a result, a number of small triangular parcels were created. . . . In 1943, the Common Council named the site in memory of Pfc. Bernard Joseph McCarthy, who was born and raised in Greenwich Village. A marine, McCarthy was killed at Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands in August 1942 at the age of 22. His was the first reported death of a Greenwich Village resident in the war.</p>
        <p>Col. Charles Young Playground</p>
        <p>6.42 acres at Lenox Avenue  and 145th Street</p>
        <p>Col. Charles Young (1864-1922) was a distinguished Army officer, cartographer, teacher and diplomat who pioneered the entrance of African-Americans into fields that were previously closed to them. He was born in Mayslick, Ky., on March 12, 1864, one year before the end of the Civil War. . . . When he entered the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1884, Young was the ninth African-American to be admitted, and the third and last to graduate until nearly half a century later.</p>
        <p>In 1894, he was assigned by the War Department to teach military science and tactics, in addition to French and mathematics, at Wilberforce University in Ohio. Young commanded the Ninth Ohio Volunteer Infantry on the home front during the Spanish-American War in 1898 and served two tours in the Philippine insurrection between 1901 and 1903. Three years later, Young was appointed as military attache to Haiti. He was the first African-American military attache in United States history. . . .</p>
        <p>After leading the 10th Cavalry Regiment on a punitive expedition against bandit Pancho Villa in Mexico in 1916, Young established a school for African-American soldiers at Fort Huachuca, Ariz. . . . Young died in Lagos, Nigeria, on Jan. 8, 1922. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery. . . .</p>
        <p>The playground is located across the street from the 369th Corps Support Battalion Armory, home of the ''Harlem Hellfighters,'' who were active in both world wars and the Korean, Vietnam and Persian Gulf wars.</p>
        <p>May Mathews Playground</p>
        <p>0.48 acre on 43rd Street  between Eighth and Ninth Avenues</p>
        <p>Social worker May Mathews (1887-1974) labored tirelessly for many years on behalf of the residents of the Clinton neighborhood of Manhattan. . . . Mathews . . . divided her time between work at the Friendly House settlement in Brooklyn and studies at the New York School of Philanthropy (now Columbia School of Social Work), where she earned a certificate in 1904. She came to live at Hartley House, a settlement house on West 46th Street between Ninth and 10th Avenues, in 1903. . . .</p>
        <p>Mathews took over the management of Hartley House in 1904 and remained as head social worker until 1954. She focused her efforts on services for New York City's newly arrived European immigrants. During her directorship, Hartley House sponsored English and citizenship classes for immigrants, discussion groups and social clubs for men and women of different age groups, and worker education groups for indus  Lt. Joseph Petrosino Park</p>
        <p>0.03 acre at Lafayette  and Kenmare Streets</p>
        <p>Giuseppe (Joseph) Petrosino was born in Salerno, Italy, and immigrated to the United States with his family in 1873. As a boy, he shined shoes outside Police Headquarters on Mulberry Street. . . . Fluent in many Italian dialects, Petrosino aided the police by working undercover as an informer in Little Italy.</p>
        <p>When he joined the Police Department in 1883, Petrosino was the city's shortest officer, at 5 feet 3 inches tall. Police Commissioner Theodore Roosevelt personally promoted him to sergeant of detectives in 1895. While investigating anarchists in the United States, Petrosino warned President McKinley of threats against his life; however, the warning was not heeded and the president was assassinated in 1901.</p>
        <p>Within 10 years, Petrosino was named lieutenant and given command of the new Italian Squad, a unit created to combat the crime organization known as the Black Hand. Under his leadership, several thousand arrests were made, and more than 500 offenders were sent to prison. Crimes against Italian-Americans dropped by 50 percent. Petrosino was killed while on assignment to Palermo, Sicily.</p>
        <p>When his body was returned to New York, thousands of mourners formed a funeral procession which marched from Little Italy to Calvary Cemetery in Queens. Lieutenant Petrosino was the only New York police officer who had died in the line of duty outside the United States. The park named in his honor is located just north of the Renaissance Revival edifice at 240 Centre Street, which served as Police Headquarters from 1910 to 1971.</p>
        <p>Murphy's Brother's Playground</p>
        <p>1.28 acres on Avenue C  and 17th Street</p>
        <p>Located near the waterfront of Manhattan's old Gas House District, this playground has been known by at least three different names over the course of its 95-year history. . . . During its early years, the site was known as the 17th Street Park.</p>
        <p>In 1921, the Board of Aldermen named the park for politician and businessman John J. Murphy (1865-1911). The son of Irish immigrants, Murphy was one of eight brothers and sisters who was raised on the East Side of Manhattan. He served as an alderman and as the acting Democratic leader of the 12th Assembly District. Murphy made his fortune as president of the New York Contracting and Trucking Company, which had a contract to excavate the site for Penn Station. His good fortune in business and politics resulted in large part from his more remarkable brother, Charles Francis Murphy (1858-1924), the sachem of Tammany Hall. . . .</p>
        <p>In 1985, new park signage saluted the achievements of the illustrious older brother, Charles. This Murphy attended local public schools until the age of 14 and formed the Sylvan Social Club for boys. After working at wire factories, in a shipyard and on the Blue Line streetcars, Murphy opened his first saloon in 1878. Serving a bowl of soup and a beer for a nickel, his various saloons were social centers. . . .</p>
        <p>Having backed several candidates from Tammany Hall, Murphy was made election district captain for the Democratic organization. . . . Named to the Tammany Hall Triumvirate of Executive Committee Members in May 1902, Murphy became Tammany's sole leader four months later. ''Silent Charlie'' brokered agreements between warring parties in his organization and helped numerous Tammany candidates win city, state and national offices.</p>
