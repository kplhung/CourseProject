        <p>Fourteen companies and nonprofit organizations from around the country have submitted proposals to manage some of the worst-performing New York City schools under a privatization plan outlined last month by Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy.</p>
        <p>Among the submissions received by yesterday's deadline was a sweeping proposal by Edison Schools, the Manhattan company that is the country's largest commercial manager of public schools, to take over 45 low-performing elementary and middle schools by the fall of 2003. Under the plan, Edison would take over 12 elementary schools in September 2001 and the remainder only if students at the initial 12 schools outperformed their peers at similar schools on standardized tests by 20 percent.</p>

        <p>Fourteen companies and nonprofit organizations from around the country have submitted proposals to manage some of the worst-performing New York City schools under a privatization plan outlined last month by Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy.</p>
        <p>Among the submissions received by yesterday's deadline was a sweeping proposal by Edison Schools, the Manhattan company that is the country's largest commercial manager of public schools, to take over 45 low-performing elementary and middle schools by the fall of 2003. Under the plan, Edison would take over 12 elementary schools in September 2001 and the remainder only if students at the initial 12 schools outperformed their peers at similar schools on standardized tests by 20 percent.</p>
        <p>Even before Edison's proposal was submitted, the program outlined by Mr. Levy and approved by the Board of Education had the potential to be one of the country's largest educational privatization efforts. In his plan, Mr. Levy appeared to be addressing two constituencies: minority families and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.</p>
        <p>Most of the schools eligible for privatization under Mr. Levy's plan are in neighborhoods with large black and Hispanic populations; nationwide, minorities have supported charter schools and other alternatives to public schools. Mr. Giuliani set aside $60.8 million of the Board of Education's $11 billion budget for the current fiscal year to pay for private management of some of the worst-performing city schools.</p>
        <p>In addition to Edison, seven other organizations in New York State submitted proposals, including Victory Schools, a Manhattan company that this fall will run three charter schools in New York City and on Long Island, and Boys Harbor Inc., a nonprofit Harlem group that last year tried and failed to secure a charter school license from state authorities.</p>
        <p>Six groups from outside the state made bids as well, including National Heritage Academies, a Grand Rapids, Mich., company that will begin operating a charter school in Rochester this fall. National Heritage has attracted criticism for its plan to make students aware of -- but not teach, the company insists -- creationism and other theories that company officials say are alternatives to the theory of evolution.</p>
        <p>Among the other companies that submitted proposals were Nobel Learning Communities of Media, Pa., and Advantage Schools of Boston, which recently gave up management of the troubled New Covenant Charter School in Albany.</p>
        <p>Karen Crowe, a spokeswoman for the New York City Board of Education, said board officials would begin reviewing the submissions this weekend to see if they fulfilled the board's requirements.</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Levy's plan, some of the roughly 50 struggling schools that are both on the state's list of ''schools under registration review'' and are part of the special Chancellor's District would be converted into charter schools beginning in the fall of 2001.</p>
        <p>Though the schools would still receive money from the city and state, their conversion to charter status would free them of many state and city regulations and allow their managers to renegotiate some union contracts. Last month, board officials said they expected five to seven schools to be privatized in the program's first year, although one official said as many as 20 could be converted.</p>
        <p>Some of the proposals received yesterday were quite modest. Victory Schools, for example, proposed converting and managing one or two schools, and Advantage Schools requested management of two schools. By contrast, beginning this fall, Edison will manage more than 100 schools nationwide.</p>
        <p>Under its proposal, Edison would invest $80 million in New York's program, recruit 1,000 highly qualified teachers, distribute about 25,000 I.B.M. computers to teachers and students, and start a $50 million philanthropic campaign to support its schools, company officials said yesterday. They also suggested a collaboration with the Board of Education to bring one of Edison's planned Teacher Colleges to New York City.  In addition, Edison said it wanted to work with the city teachers' union, the United Federation of Teachers, in developing the schools.</p>
        <p>Benno Schmidt, the chairman of Edison, said he believes that in order to determine whether this type of experiment will work, many schools must be privatized.</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 22, 2000, Tuesday  An article on Saturday about organizations that seek to manage some of New York City's lowest-performing schools referred incorrectly to the status of Boys Harbor Inc., a nonprofit group in Harlem. Its application for a charter school license was approved by the trustees of the State University of New York in January and was approved by the Board of Regents in April; the school is scheduled to open in Harlem this fall. Boys Harbor did not fail to get a license.</p>
