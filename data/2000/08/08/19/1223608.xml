        <p>Burrowing through last Sunday's Times, I parked at Page 10 of the A section, lured by a promisingly long article on the importance of beauty queens in Venezuela (''Narcissism's Homeland Could Be Here'' was the subhead) and below that by a wry account, irresistible to this longtime fan of Cuban music, of a concert in Havana on Friday night, Aug. 11 (''Buena Vista Social Club, Little Known in Cuba, Is Glad to Be Home'').

        <p>Burrowing through last Sunday's Times, I parked at Page 10 of the A section, lured by a promisingly long article on the importance of beauty queens in Venezuela (''Narcissism's Homeland Could Be Here'' was the subhead) and below that by a wry account, irresistible to this longtime fan of Cuban music, of a concert in Havana on Friday night, Aug. 11 (''Buena Vista Social Club, Little Known in Cuba, Is Glad to Be Home''). Imagining Ruben Gonzalez and Compay Segundo in concert at -- where else? -- Havana's Karl Marx Theater put me in such a good mood I felt up for a return to the less than amusing pages on the Democratic Party convention follies.</p>
        <p>But alas, next to the Cuban story, at the bottom of the page, was something else. Only a tiny article, five sentences in all, it brought me the heart-rending news that on that same Friday, in the afternoon, my friend, Bei Ling, the distinguished Chinese poet and editor, had been arrested in Beijing.</p>
        <p>This has been a hard period for writers, artists and moviemakers of talent in China. Persecution is mounting as the Chinese government feels assured that so small an issue as freedom of expression cannot halt the inexorable embrace of China by global business interests (a.k.a. ''Western governments''). But Bei Ling seemed, well, too slight a figure to bring down the wrath of the Chinese police state.  And then, he does live in the United States and is an American resident.</p>
        <p>But, yes, he does write. And yes, he edits an intellectual journal. After he came to the States in 1988 on a literary exchange program -- and decided to stay when China's burgeoning free speech and democracy movement was violently closed down by the government the following year -- in 1993 he founded, with a group of writer friends, like himself all Chinese exiles in their 30's, a magazine called ''Tendency.'' Nominally a quarterly (13 issues have appeared so far), the magazine is edited in Cambridge, where Bei Ling and his co-editor Meng Fang live, and printed in either Hong Kong or Taiwan. Most of the print run, which is between 2,000 and 3,000 copies, is sold by subscription to Sinologists and Chinese intellectuals and writers living abroad; a thousand or so copies are taken into China and given away.</p>
        <p>That is what Bei Ling was doing when he was arrested. I always worry when he goes back to China with his copies to distribute in student and literary circles in Shanghai and Beijing. But, as before, he assured me, when we last talked here in New York, that the magazine's existence was tolerated by the Chinese authorities and that he would not be in any danger.</p>
        <p>He had arrived in Beijing from Shanghai on Friday, with plans to hold a discussion forum that afternoon to review the latest issue of ''Tendency.''</p>
        <p>And now he has been ''formally detained,'' according to the Chinese formula, which allows the government to keep him in jail for 30 days while it is decided what charges will be brought against him. And of course all the copies of the new issue have been confiscated.</p>
        <p>Bad things happen in August. Mid-August especially. There is no moment in the year when it is harder to get people's attention, as I can testify, having done little else since last Sunday except call and e-mail people who could possibly join me in bringing attention to Bei Ling's plight. There's the Democratic Convention, there is the riveting horror of the Russian sub. And as one knowledgeable Sinologist friend said, ''You're running into Arrested Chinese Dissident Fatigue.''</p>
        <p>The best one can hope for Bei Ling is that, after being roughed up, he will be expelled from the country -- sent back here. It is more likely, however, that he will be put on trial. According to one Hong Kong-based rights group, the police department in charge of Bei Ling's case handles subversion cases only.</p>
        <p>Subversion, need it be said, carries a prison sentence of many years. I am not going to claim that Bei Ling has no political views. Of course he does. He is for freedom of speech and expression in China. He cares passionately about independent (or ''underground'') culture in China. Neither will I argue that ''Tendency'' is an apolitical, purely literary enterprise. The people Bei Ling and his colleagues print in their magazine are hardly neutral on the subject of democracy or freedom of expression. They print independent and censored Chinese writers. They have translated and done interviews with a number of foreign writers, including Seamus Heaney, Nadine Gordimer, Czeslaw Milosz, Octavio Paz and myself -- Ms. Gordimer and I are also on the board of editorial advisers. Dialogues between Chinese and ''Western'' writers are a central feature of the magazine. When we meet, Bei Ling wants to talk about Roland Barthes and Walter Benjamin, and about my time in Sarajevo, and I want to talk about literature and film and the possibilities of independent expression in today's China.</p>
        <p>To give an idea of the range of the magazine, the summer 1996 issue contained translations of three essays and several poems by Joseph Brodsky, as well as a critical article on Brodsky and an essay on the problems of translating Brodsky into Chinese; a special section on religion (both Confucianism and Christianity) in modern China; a group of essays on Chinese poetry in the 90's; a play; and essays on ''the third world intellectual,'' on overseas Chinese woman writers, on the reaction of German intellectuals to the fall of the Berlin Wall and on the problems of ''intellectuals in a closed society.'' The closed society, of course, is China today.</p>
        <p>In the post-cold war atmosphere of globalization, in which the needs of doing business increasingly take precedence over (or incorporate) all other concerns, governments seem increasingly unwilling to intervene in such cases. The business of America is business. Above all, China business. The passage of legislation normalizing trade relations with China is imminent. Nobody wants to prevent Americans from getting richer.</p>
        <p>Is it too much to hope that the fate of one important literary figure, a legal resident of the United States, languishing at this moment in jail in Beijing, could be of interest to our government? Is it too much to hope that private citizens could be mobilized to speak out for this lone scholar and poet? To be sure, public outcry is only part of the story. In most cases, where dissidents have been freed by their despotic governments, the key influence was behind-the-scene pressure by high-level government officials. But public outcry is a start.</p>
        <p>If there is silence about Bei Ling, one can only fear the worst for him -- and for others in China (two days ago his brother, who lives in Beijing, was arrested). It is simply a green light to the Chinese government that it can act with impunity in such cases; indeed, that it can enlarge the scope of its persecution and intimidation of independent thought. If nobody responds, the message to the Chinese government could hardly be clearer.</p>
        <p>Surely the business of America is, ought to be, democracy and freedom, too.</p>
