        <p>Roy Rosa watched the television images of Democratic conventioneers whirling like dervishes after Senator Edward M. Kennedy finished his speech on Tuesday night and asked, ''Don't these people realize they're going to lose?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosa, a college student, joined three other independent voters in a hotel room here earlier this week to view the convention, cracking jokes at the proceedings and matching notes on what did or did not work about the orchestrated series of speeches presented by Democratic loyalists.</p>
        <p>Much of the convention's rhetoric, they agreed, seemed specifically focused upon attracting independent voters like themselves without loyalty to any party.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosa is perhaps the definition of an independent voter: a member of both the National Rifle Association and the board of the national Gay and Lesbian Task Force, he supported Senator John McCain's presidential bid. Like the other voters gathered here to watch the convention, he approached with an open, if skeptical, mind.</p>
        <p>Three of the four had supported President Clinton when he first ran for the White House in 1992; two had even done volunteer work in his campaign. But none of them voted for Mr. Clinton in 1996, and not one would support him if he were running today, they said.</p>
        <p>''All the lying and duplicity just bugged me with Clinton,'' said Sarah Edgell, a 42-year-old graphic designer who voted for Ross Perot in 1996 as a protest against the president. ''He is such a complex man. He can seem so honest and then be such a liar.''</p>
        <p>Jeanne Smith, 29, an administrator for the University of Colorado's Health Science Center, said, ''I didn't trust him then and I don't trust him now.''</p>
        <p>Her husband, Keith, a senior officer with the American Indian College Fund, said that after feeling initial enthusiasm for the Clinton administration, he had become progressively disenchanted with the Democrats over their handling of Indian issues.</p>
        <p>But that did not mean he was willing to leap to the Republicans. ''George Bush doesn't understand Indian affairs,'' said Mr. Smith, a member of the Navajo tribe.</p>
        <p>Going into the convention, he had been leaning toward Vice President Al Gore, as was Ms. Edgell; Mrs. Smith had not made up her mind, and Mr. Rosa, 22, planned to vote for Ralph Nader.</p>
        <p>The election, Ms. Edgell said, should be about providing homes, education, food, and health care for everybody. ''There are so many people out there working for the minimum wage, not getting anywhere,'' she said. ''I don't want someone as president who's just a mouthpiece for big business.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosa, a former member of the Reserve Officers Training Corps, said:  '' 'Don't ask, don't tell' in the military was a big mistake. The Democrats give gays a seat at the table, then bind us to the chair. They don't want to hear us speak.</p>
        <p>''In my main issue, gay rights, both parties get an 'F.' ''</p>
        <p>It was Senator Joseph I. Lieberman's speech on Wednesday night that seemed to most heighten the viewers' interests in the Democratic ticket.</p>
        <p>Particularly important, said Mr. Smith, 31, was Mr. Lieberman's emphasis on his religion. ''Respect for faith is part of the Navajo being,'' Mr. Smith said. ''A lot of our relationships with other people and other tribes are grounded in our respect for others' beliefs.''</p>
        <p>''I definitely want to know more about Lieberman,'' Mr. Smith said. ''He was genuine in what he had to say. He was so natural and honest; he didn't sound like a politician.''</p>
        <p>By the time Mr. Gore took the podium on Thursday night, Mr. Smith was even more inclined to vote for him, as were his wife and Ms. Edgell; Mr. Rosa was still wavering between Mr. Gore and Mr. Nader.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith said: ''His speech started off slowly, basically rehashing all the stuff we'd heard before. He picked up in the middle, but overall, I was disappointed.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Edgell and Mr. Rosa, though, said the vice president's speech was an unqualified success. ''I loved that he talked about traditional Democratic values and working-family issues,'' Ms. Edgell said.</p>
        <p>But among the four voters, the most affected by the speech was Mr. Rosa.</p>
        <p>''Sure, it was banal and boring at the beginning, but when he got warmed up it was awesome,'' Mr. Rosa said. ''He covered the whole plight of the working class and he didn't do it in a patronizing way.''</p>
        <p>And if one goal of the quadrennial Democratic Party's party was to solidify its base, Mr. Rosa said he thought the vice president's speech accomplished that mission.</p>
        <p>''He really energized the activists by talking about Roe v. Wade, and hate crimes and racial profiling,'' Mr. Rosa said. ''Gore did it very well, and I was really impressed. He sold himself to me at the same time. Yeah, I'm going vote for him.''</p>
