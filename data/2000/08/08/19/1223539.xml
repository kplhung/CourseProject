        <p>Anoushka Shankar's father, Ravi Shankar, learned what it was like to play Indian classical music for uncomprehending audiences at 1960's rock festivals like Monterey Pop and Woodstock. Ms. Shankar, who is 19, had her version of the experience on Thursday night at Central Park Summerstage, where she shared a bill with Roni Size's band Reprazent, a dance-music dynamo.</p>
        <p>The audience that packed every square foot of Rumsey Playfield was there for Mr. Size's feverish drum-and-bass propulsion, and it eventually got exactly what it wanted.</p>
        <p>Reprazent merges human and machine, with Mr. Size and three fellow disc jockeys (Krust, Die and Suv) working computer consoles behind Rob Merrill on drums, Si John on bass, a singer, Onallee, and a rapper, MC Dynamite.</p>
        <p>They take the relentless computerized beat of drum-and-bass, which has threatened to become a dance-music cliche, and partly humanize it with a flesh-and-blood rhythm section.</p>
        <p>At the same time, they pile on so many samples and effects that the music turns dizzying and enveloping.  Each sound has been shaped to create maximum disorientation. Notes began with one timbre, only to mutate and distort a fraction of a second later; sounds echoed all around the beat, toying with time perception.</p>
        <p>Instead of playing nonstop music, like a dance disc jockey, Reprazent performed discrete songs drawn from its 1997 album, ''New Forms'' (Mercury) and its coming one, ''In the Mode'' (Def Jam), to be released  on Oct. 24.</p>
        <p>Some of the new material moved toward hip-hop and rhythm-and-blues. ''Who Told You'' picked up the blunt beat and plinking synthesizer of Detroit ghetto-tech, with MC Dynamite rapping in sync with the bass drum; ''Lucky Pressure'' had Onallee singing rhythm-and-blues verses and refrains over a backdrop of melancholy string-orchestra chords and the fast beat. But the core of the music was its hurtling momentum and aural density, an ominous thrill ride through a barrage of perfectly placed zingers.</p>
        <p>Ms. Shankar gracefully handled a crowd that treated her ragas as a backdrop to conversation. Before one piece, she gently asked people to be a little quieter during the slow, exploratory introductions to the ragas because she couldn't hear herself. She kept those preludes fairly short, floating their wisps of melody. Then she was joined by two tabla drummers, Bikram Ghosh and Tanmoy Bose, for the faster, flashier sections of the ragas; they engaged Ms. Shankar and each other in quick volleys.</p>
        <p>Ms. Shankar started her career performing alongside her father, who is also her teacher, and her impressive technique drew immediate praise. But she was playing music she had memorized, while Indian classical music revolves around improvisation. Performing on her own, she has begun to improvise, and her inexperience shows.</p>
        <p>Like her father, she plays long lines of what would be eighth-notes in Western notation. But where Mr. Shankar makes those phrases jab and strike, Ms. Shankar does not yet match his flexibility of rhythm and pitch or his aggressive sense of direction. But she's fast-fingered and sure, and when she and the drummers chased each other through her speedy finales, conversation gave way to applause.</p>
        <p>To connect the disparate parts of the concert, Summerstage added Asian underground dance music, which blends electronic dance beats with traditional voices and drumming from India and Pakistan. A short set presented a trans-Atlantic alliance: the disc jockey Siraiki, from the New York Asian underground parties called Mutiny, and Chandrasonic, the Asian Dub Foundation in England, traded drones, hovering voices and breakneck drum-and-bass beats.</p>
