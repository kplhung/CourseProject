        <p>Mario M Cuomo letter replies to Aug 16 editorial suggesting that Rupert Murdoch, owner of New York Post, be barred from buying WWOR Channel 9</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I was surprised by your Aug. 16 editorial suggesting that Rupert Murdoch, who owns The New York Post, should be barred from buying WWOR Channel 9. In 1993, I worked to help save the struggling newspaper. Mr. Murdoch was trying to buy it but needed a Federal Communications Commission waiver.</p>
        <p>Frankly, the paper's demise would have been a benefit to me politically because it sharply disputed my positions for 12 years. But I believed then, as I do now, that its loss would be a tragedy, putting  thousands of people out of work and striking a blow to journalistic diversity. The F.C.C. agreed and granted the waiver.</p>

        <p>Not a lot has changed since 1993, except that media diversity here has increased. Also, The Post got its wish, and I'm now in the private sector. The Post has been very much a fiscal adventure for Mr. Murdoch, and I hope he does not change his mind about his investment; the purchase of Channel 9 may help assure that he doesn't.</p>
