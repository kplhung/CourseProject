        <p>Roaring into Vice President Al Gore's home state on the morning after the Democratic National Convention, Gov. George W. Bush accused Mr. Gore today of delivering a convention speech that sowed divisions and fomented class warfare among Americans.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the vice president, whose convention speech had portrayed the presidential election as a contest between ''the people'' and ''the powerful,'' used a riverboat trip through the Midwest to press his claim of being a crusader against the influence of big corporations and their privileged chieftains. [Page A11.]</p>
        <p>''The voters have a clear choice,'' Mr. Bush said at a rally in Bartlett, a Memphis suburb. ''They've got one candidate who wants four more years of finger-pointing and politicizing and blaming, a candidate who will pit one group of people against another, a candidate who wants to wage class warfare to get ahead.''</p>
        <p>''I've got a different vision of leadership,'' Mr. Bush added. ''A leader is somebody who finds common ground.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gore, speaking in La Crosse, Wis., this morning before he shoved off on his boat trip, implied that some people were striving harder and less successfully than others and made clear that he wanted to be their champion.</p>
        <p>''This whole struggle is about the future of this country and what happens for working families,'' the vice president said, referring to his presidential bid. ''Don't ever lose sight of the fact that this is a struggle.''</p>
        <p>With their competing statements and viewpoints, Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore were delineating what will undoubtedly be some of the sharpest battle lines between them this fall. There were distinct echoes of presidential elections past, in which Democrats tried, sometimes successfully,  to tag Republicans as the protectors of privilege.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore were also vying for the precious, fickle attention of voters as the conventions faded into memory and the candidates headed into the final 11 weeks of a race that many political analysts say will be extraordinarily close.</p>
        <p>Each candidate sought to make a statement with his itinerary today. Mr. Bush pointedly traveled to Mr. Gore's political doorstep, and the banner behind him on the stage at his rally said, ''Listen to People Who Know Them Best.''</p>
        <p>It was a reference to the candidates' standings in their home states, Texas and Tennessee. Throughout the day, Mr. Bush's advisers mentioned that polls showed Mr. Bush in a tight race against Mr. Gore in Tennessee, while Mr. Gore trailed Mr. Bush by a double-digit percentile margin in Texas.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's advisers pulled out all the stops for his rally here in an enormous warehouse packed with thousands of wildly enthusiastic supporters.</p>
        <p>The singer Travis Tritt performed several songs before Mr. Bush took the stage, and Mr. Bush was flanked by his running mate, Dick Cheney, and by Tennessee's two Republican senators, Bill Frist and Fred Thompson. The end of Mr. Bush's remarks, which lasted only about 15 minutes, was punctuated with a blizzard of confetti.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, for his part, hopped aboard an old-fashioned paddle boat to head down the Mississippi, indulging in a bit of political theater that wrapped his journey in a populist aura and evoked the sturdy, timeless values of the American heartland.</p>
        <p>The vice president was determined to sustain whatever momentum he had wrung from his party's four-day jubilee in Los Angeles and from his political coronation on Thursday night. Mr. Bush was equally determined to stop it.</p>
        <p>The vice president was singling out a cluster of swing states that could prove decisive in the fall election. Mr. Bush was asserting, as he had with his campaign schedule over the previous four weeks, that his potent appeal to voters would enable him to compete in, and possibly win, states where the odds should be against him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's comments at the rally in Bartlett and aboard his campaign plane as he flew to Memphis from Austin, Tex., represented his first public response to the Democrats' convention and his opening salvo against Mr. Gore following the event. It was aggressive and relatively unhampered by one of his campaign's central slogans, to ''change the tone'' in Washington.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush expressed skepticism, for example, about Mr. Gore's vow on Thursday night to make an overhaul of campaign finance laws the first piece of legislation he would tackle if elected president.</p>
        <p>''I don't think he's got credibility on the issue,'' Mr. Bush told reporters on his plane, reminding them of ''the Buddhist temple event'' that symbolized the ethical questions raised after Mr. Gore's aggressive fund-raising for the Democratic Party in 1996.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush also said that the array of resolutions in Mr. Gore's convention speech, including pledges to shore up Social Security and expand Medicare to include a prescription-drug benefit for elderly Americans, was really a litany of unaccomplished goals during the seven and a half years Mr. Gore has been vice president.</p>
        <p>''Last night we heard a laundry list of new promises, which I thought was an attempt to cover up old failures,'' Mr. Bush told the audience at his rally.</p>
        <p>''As much as he tried to separate himself from the squandered opportunities of his own administration,'' he continued, ''the vice president's speech reminded us of the fundamental choice in this election: Will we prolong four more years of Clinton-Gore, or will we give America a fresh start?''</p>
        <p>That question underscored one of the central gambles of Mr. Bush's campaign, which is betting that despite the country's extraordinary prosperity and President Clinton's high job-approval ratings, a majority of American voters wants a new party in the White House and a person in the Oval Office with no ties to the current president.</p>
        <p>Any lingering doubt that Mr. Bush was campaigning in large part against Mr. Clinton's moral behavior in office was dispelled by the comments that Mr. Cheney, Mr. Frist and Mr. Thompson made in introducing Mr. Bush at the rally today. They all spoke of the need to take integrity back to the White House, and they all praised Mr. Bush as the candidate who could best do that.</p>
        <p>In his own remarks, Mr. Bush dwelled longest on the topic of improving education for American schoolchildren, which he said would be his top priority in the White House.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush plans to spend most of the next two weeks on the campaign trail talking about education, the issue on which he has long depended most heavily to reach out to independent and swing voters in the political center.</p>
        <p>It is also one of the issues with which he will seek to inoculate himself against contentions by Mr. Gore that he cares too little about those Americans struggling to build a better life.</p>
        <p>Many of the education proposals that Mr. Bush has made, and several more that he will make in the coming days, are aimed at -- or at least framed in terms of -- improving the education of poor children. On Saturday in New Mexico, for instance, Mr. Bush plans to outline a new educational initiative for American Indians.</p>
        <p>On his plane this morning, Mr. Bush said it was unfair that on the day of Mr. Gore's convention speech, news had leaked out about a new grand jury to investigate Mr. Clinton's affair with a White House intern.</p>
        <p>''As we say in Texas, that wasn't right,'' Mr. Bush said, enunciating the word ''wasn't'' in a drawl.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush showed Mr. Gore less sympathy on other fronts, questioning whether there was enough fiscal restraint in all the spending the vice president had outlined in his convention speech and taking issue with some aspects of his populist oratory.</p>
        <p>''It's hard to lead a nation by dividing, by pitting people against each other,'' Mr. Bush said. ''That's the rhetoric of the past.''</p>
        <p>For all the firepower that Mr. Bush brought to his rally, it was the only public event on today's schedule, which ended in midafternoon so Mr. Bush could go running.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, by contrast, talked about health care policy aboard the riverboat and made stops for rallies for more than 12 hours.</p>
