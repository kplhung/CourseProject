        <p>This election is not about ideology,'' Michael Dukakis declared in his acceptance speech at the 1988 Democratic Convention. ''It's about competence.'' The Republicans grinned, and George Bush went on to win by making sure that ideology ruled the campaign.</p>
        <p>This year, another George Bush is saying, ''It's not about ideology; it's about character.'' Al Gore, running behind, has little choice but to imitate the elder Bush and try to turn the race into an ideological debate. His acceptance speech on Thursday night began the process, and many observers thought that Mr. Gore finally sounded like a leader of genuine conviction.  Between now and Election Day he will have to build on that speech and sharpen his disagreements with Mr. Bush. But this puts Mr. Gore in a dilemma because the public perception is that the parties are alike. And he has done as much as anyone to dull the apparent differences.</p>
        <p>Al Gore has always seemed more a technician than a leader. He hasn't caught the popular imagination or inspired grass-roots activism on behalf of any cause. But he exudes competence. Until this week, he staked his claim to the presidency on being a manager of the good times. His campaign slogan might as well have been, ''First, do no harm.''</p>
        <p>''He's trying to be a good night watchman,'' an unnamed relative of his told The Times before his speech.</p>
        <p>In some ways, a manager might be ideally suited for our age. Polls have not revealed any burning issue galvanizing the electorate. In one recent survey, education topped the list of concerns, but only 18 percent mentioned it. In this second Gilded Age, the public seems to want its leaders to keep the books and get out of the way of entrepreneurs and inventors, the real agents of our greatness.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, in his speech, practically admitted that Mr. Bush is the more likable candidate. So he has had to strain for some meaning in his own candidacy other than competence, and what he offered on Thursday was a fight for ''working families'' against powerful interests.</p>
        <p>Having destroyed Bill Bradley for his overly ambitious health care plan, Mr. Gore is now trying to make his own plan seem more ambitious than it really is. In fact, his list of proposals is largely defensive and incremental. In his speech the drop from populist rhetoric to modest policy kept producing an almost audible thud: ''For that waitress carrying trays, or a construction worker in the winter cold, I will never agree to raise the retirement age to 70.''</p>
        <p>The positions in Mr. Gore's speech represent real differences between the two parties, but the limited government activism he offered does not produce sharp images or evoke large passions. An ideological candidacy needs an overarching theme, but having helped blur the edges of the Democratic Party for the past decade, Mr. Gore can't afford to embrace the most readily available one: liberalism.</p>
        <p>Moving to the left has not produced a Democratic winner in half a century. But the Republicans are trying to reoccupy the center, and Mr. Gore is squeezed for ground. Bill Clinton owned the center with the advantages of his own charisma and the alienation of much of the country from his opponents in Congress and their hard-right views. Mr. Gore's opponent, with his talk of ''compassionate conservatism'' and ''my heart,'' sounds more like Mr. Clinton than like Tom DeLay.</p>
        <p>Running behind in the midst of prosperity has entangled Mr. Gore in a  thicket of contradictions. Claiming credit for the boom, he also has to argue for the continued existence of the problems for which he can offer solutions. A Fortune 500 C.E.O. recently told me that the Clinton-Gore administration has been much more attuned to the interests of high technology than Presidents Reagan and Bush. Now Mr. Gore is making corporate America his whipping post.</p>
        <p>He is forced to run on a vision of ambivalence: ''Times are good, but not that good.'' Mr. Bush's message,  by contrast, is one of innuendo but not indecision: ''Times are good, but this administration is rotten.''</p>
        <p>There is a chance that Mr. Gore's populist rhetoric will turn off middle-class swing voters, ''working families'' doing too well to want even an incrementally liberal president. But a greater risk for Mr. Gore is that no one will notice or care -- that the years of neutralizing the party's ideology have done their work too well, and the public will make this election the personality contest that Mr. Gore says it shouldn't be.</p>
        <p>Perhaps, like that other wooden, remote, cerebral Democrat, Woodrow Wilson, Mr. Gore, once in office, would  set the tone of high idealism promised in his acceptance speech. Perhaps he would show himself to be not a technician but a leader, willing to address the subtle corrosion in the Clinton years -- corporate dominance of politics, citizen apathy, persistent inequality, and the triumph of private interest over a vision of the common good. When the bill for these comes due, we will need more than competent bookkeepers.</p>
        <p>But the rationale for the centrist turn of the Democrats was always electoral victory. What will the party do if Al Gore loses?</p>
