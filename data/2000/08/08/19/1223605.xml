        <p>The owner of a car salvage business in Flatlands, Brooklyn, discovered a human skeleton yesterday in the trunk of a car he had bought at a city auction, the police said.</p>
        <p>The man, who owns Auto Gobbler, at East 56th Street and Preston Court, discovered the skeleton when he popped open the trunk of a 1993 red Chevrolet Lumina.</p>
        <p>Police officials did not know when the man had bought it at auction, but they said the car was towed off the street in February from a neighborhood in northern Queens. It was then sent to a storage center in College Point to await sale.</p>
        <p>The police said they were investigating the origins and the identity of the skeleton, although they did not know who was the previous owner of the Chevy.</p>
