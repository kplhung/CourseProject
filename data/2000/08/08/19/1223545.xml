        <p>In the early days of the period instrument movement, when accomplished players were comparatively few, listeners grew used to seeing the same musicians performing under the flags of several ensembles, each of which either explored a different corner of the repertory or helped bring to life a different leader's interpretive ideas. Now the pool of musicians able to turn out polished, technically first-rate performances on period instruments in the United States is large enough to support active early-music scenes on both coasts. Yet the urge to regroup apparently remains as strong among early-music players as among jazz musicians.</p>
        <p>La Luna, a quartet that specializes in Baroque chamber music, is a group drawn from other groups, and rather far-flung ones. Ingrid Mathews, one of the two violinists, is the music director of the Seattle Baroque Orchestra, and the quartet's harpsichordist, Byron Schenckman, is the Seattle group's artistic director. The other violinist, Scott Metcalfe, and the cellist, Emily Walhout, are members of the King's Noyse, a Renaissance ensemble based in Boston. La Luna made its public debut at the Boston Early Music Festival in 1995, and since then has toured and made recordings.</p>

        <p>In the early days of the period instrument movement, when accomplished players were comparatively few, listeners grew used to seeing the same musicians performing under the flags of several ensembles, each of which either explored a different corner of the repertory or helped bring to life a different leader's interpretive ideas. Now the pool of musicians able to turn out polished, technically first-rate performances on period instruments in the United States is large enough to support active early-music scenes on both coasts. Yet the urge to regroup apparently remains as strong among early-music players as among jazz musicians.</p>
        <p>La Luna, a quartet that specializes in Baroque chamber music, is a group drawn from other groups, and rather far-flung ones. Ingrid Mathews, one of the two violinists, is the music director of the Seattle Baroque Orchestra, and the quartet's harpsichordist, Byron Schenckman, is the Seattle group's artistic director. The other violinist, Scott Metcalfe, and the cellist, Emily Walhout, are members of the King's Noyse, a Renaissance ensemble based in Boston. La Luna made its public debut at the Boston Early Music Festival in 1995, and since then has toured and made recordings.</p>
        <p>The Frick Collection, which has an unimpeachable record of spotting fine period instrument bands early in their careers, presented La Luna in its New York debut on Wednesday afternoon. The program was devoted to 17th-century Italian composers, both famous (Frescobaldi, Rossi, Marini and Cavalli) and obscure (Falconieri, Selma y Salaverde, Fontana and Castello), and it offered a thorough examination of this ensemble's considerable strengths as well as the charms of the repertory.</p>
        <p>The works at hand -- canzonas, sonatas, fantasias and assorted dance movements -- were composed to entertain by way of a form of virtuosity that was subtle compared with that of Romantic times. Where Romantic virtuosity seeks to evoke a sense of the heroic, or at least, the larger-than-life, the Baroque variety is about inventiveness.</p>
        <p>It would be incorrect to say that technical polish is beside the point. Falconieri's and Marini's violin lines and Frescobaldi's keyboard writing made great demands. But what dazzles in these works is not so much the grand gesture as the tiny one -- the fleetness of a passing embellishment, for example, or the deftness with which two strands of counterpoint are wound together.</p>
        <p>La Luna played its program with an involving zestiness. Ms. Matthews and Mr. Metcalf each produced a distinctive violin sound -- hers was brighter, his had a viola's depth -- that worked particularly well in trio sonatas where the two lines had a conversational give and take. Ms. Matthews often seemed to have the edge when the music demanded agility, although in the florid passage work of the Fontana Sonata No. 17, Mr. Metcalf easily matched the clarity and shapeliness of her ornamentation.</p>
        <p>Baroque works often require a cellist to provide only a steady bass line, mirrored and expanded upon by the harpsichord, but La Luna chose works -- a gallarda by Falconieri and a sonata by Marini, for example -- that gave Ms. Walhout a bit more to do. She executed her soloistic moments deftly and with an appealingly rounded tone. And Mr. Schenkman brought a dramatic interpretive touch to a handful of Frescobaldi solo works.</p>
