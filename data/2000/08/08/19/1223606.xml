        <p>Just a month or so short of their 18th birthdays, and newly introduced to the shaving-cream market, Paul and Morgan Hamm are back to wearing matching clothes.</p>
        <p>On occasion, when they were into OshKosh overalls and pajamas with feet, their mom, Cecily, would dress her twin sons alike for fun. But she always encouraged them to be individuals, to pursue their own paths. Still, somewhere along the way, the Hamm twins developed identical ambitions.</p>
        <p>On Thursday night, both walked off the floor of the Fleet Center after the men's preliminary round of the United States Olympic gymnastics trials, each in red, white and blue warmups, and each closing in on a trip to Sydney, Australia. Paul Hamm is in the best position of the two to make the six-man team, which will be named after the finals on Saturday.</p>
        <p>By nailing his pommel-horse routine and high-bar performance with a pair of 9.75 scores, he finished in  second place behind Blaine Wilson. The top four gymnasts -- ranked by their combined scores from the trials and July's nationals -- are on the team. The fifth and sixth places on the team will be decided by a selection committee through a more subjective process.</p>
        <p>That puts Morgan Hamm in a much more precarious position. Entering the finals, he is sixth among the men, just ahead of 30-year-old John Roethlisberger, a two-time Olympian.</p>
        <p>''Can John make the Olympic team just because he made the last one?'' Olympic Coach Peter Kormann said. ''No. He knows he has to do well in the finals.''</p>
        <p>Roethlisberger's career on the national team spans more than two presidential terms. The Hamms aren't eligible to vote yet. Roethlisberger wears a knee brace, has absorbed as many injuries as a crash-test dummy, but is looking for one last Olympic team berth.</p>
        <p>''I'm as prepared as I can be, and I've trained well, but it's just not happening for me right now,'' a mystified Roethlisberger said after several spills in the preliminaries. ''I can't explain why I'm not hitting my routines. On the vault, I was fine, but I got lost in the air and then I'm on my butt. On the high bar, I was in perfect shape and then I ended up landing on my back.</p>
        <p>''I don't know what it is. I mean I'm 30, but with the way I've been practicing, it's not age. In that respect, that doesn't make sense.''</p>
        <p>The Hamms are newborns in comparison. Unlike women's gymnasts, maturing into your 20's is an asset, with men gaining strength as they exit from their teens. That makes the Hamms' arrival on this stage -- perhaps with such force that it nudges out some of the older, more established gymnasts like Roethlisberger -- even more remarkable.</p>
        <p>''It's surprising how calm they are in competition,'' Kormann said. ''They look like seasoned veterans.''</p>
        <p>Beneath the peach fuzz, they are intense and focused, but not blind to what the other is doing. After Morgan Hamm fell off the pommel horse during preliminaries, one of the first people to approach him was his brother.</p>
        <p>''He was like, 'You're strong, don't get down,' '' Morgan said. ''He really psyched me up. He got me going and was right there to get me back on track. We want to motivate each other. We want the other one to do well. That's the way it is with us.''</p>
        <p>There are no visible signs of a sibling rivalry. As if to punctuate their normality, they entered an interview room Thursday night looking like cast members off the set of a Doublemint commercial, oozing wholesomeness, dripping Americana. It was a scene made complete by a couple of quaint facts. They grew up in Waukesha, Wis., with a father who was once an all-American diver and a mother who makes candles.</p>
        <p>Together, the Hamm twins appear to be a pair of fresh faces to light up the men's team, two similar soothing voices that come at you in stereo. No twins have ever made a men's Olympic gymnastics team.</p>
        <p>''I like going through this with my twin,'' Morgan Hamm said. ''I think to be in the position we're in is great.''</p>
        <p>Even their enthusiasm is equal. As Morgan spoke, Paul finished his sentence. But there are ways to tell them apart. In competition, Paul is the more consistent one. In appearance, Morgan is the one with the slight curve in the bridge of his nose.</p>
        <p>''We both want the same thing,'' Paul Hamm said. ''Right now, Morgan is on the spot a little bit. He could get in or fall out. I want to see him hit his routines when I'm watching.</p>
        <p>''If I made it and he didn't, I'm sure he'd be happy for me, but we want to do this together. That's what we're here for. That's our goal.''</p>
