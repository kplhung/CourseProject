        <p>Re ''Cheney Is Said to Be Receiving $20 Million Retirement Package'' (front page, Aug. 12):</p>
        <p>Let's not intimate that it's wrong for Dick Cheney to become a successful businessman after serving so many years in public service. He should be lauded for giving up a lucrative career and placing himself under the microscope so as to serve his country again.</p>
        <p>As far as his retirement windfall goes, his potential to participate in Halliburton stock over the next 10 years is obviously a conflict. But the solution is simple. Either have the company buy the options back at a fair, agreed-upon price, subject to a third-party opinion, or swap them back to the company to be exchanged for the performance of a blind pool trust.</p>
