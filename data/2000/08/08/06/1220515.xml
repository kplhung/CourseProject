        <p>Ellen Bond Pendleton, a violinist, and Dr. John Karl Troyer, a biotechnologist, are to be married today by the Rev. Jennifer J. McKenna at the Second Presbyterian Church in Baltimore.</p>
        <p>The bride, 34, is first violinist with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. She received bachelor's and master's degrees in music from the Juilliard School. She is a daughter of Philip Pendleton of Winter Park, Fla., and the late Susan Pendleton.</p>
        <p>The bridegroom, 34, is the laboratory director and vice president for development of Brassica Protection Products, a Baltimore company that makes dietary products intended to aid in the prevention of cancer. He graduated cum laude from Old Dominion University and received a doctorate in biomedical research from Eastern Virginia Medical School. He is a son of Virginia and Thomas Troyer of Stow, Ohio.</p>
        <p>The couple met in May 1999 through an Internet dating service.</p>
        <p>''I work at night when everybody else is out dating, so I thought I'd try the Internet,'' Ms. Pendleton said. For Dr. Troyer, who had been divorced for a year, the Internet was, his bride-to-be said, a way of ''putting his toe in the dating pool.''</p>
        <p>Among the things that attracted him in her online profile was her interest in cooking and music, two of his own passions. They also both enjoyed running and other physical activities. In time, they learned that they had been practically neighbors once in Baltimore, and that they were born two days apart.</p>
        <p>''In my ad, I simply said I was a professional in the arts,'' Ms. Pendleton said, partly because she doesn't think she fits the stereotype of a classical musician. ''I never listen to classical music,'' said Ms. Pendleton. ''I'm more into country fiddling. My CD collection is way heavy on jazz and rock.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Troyer made a good first impression on her during their first phone conversation.</p>
        <p>''After talking for a while, he said, 'Oh, you're the redhead in the symphony,' '' Ms. Pendleton recalled. Familiarity with music was a prerequisite for her. ''I'd have to have someone I could come home and discuss performances with,'' she said.</p>
        <p>After exchanging e-mail messages and phone calls (''to make sure that we weren't crazy people,'' Ms. Pendleton said), they agreed to meet for lunch. They wowed each other, although Dr. Troyer was skittish. ''The divorce was still fresh, and I wasn't sure if I wanted to subject someone else to a big romance,'' he said. ''But on the way back home, I thought, 'You've just met someone incredibly attractive.' So as soon as I got home, I called and made another date.''</p>
        <p>Two nights later she arrived at his house in Baltimore for a home-cooked dinner.</p>
        <p>''She looked at the ingredients and asked, 'What are you making, chicken saltimbocca?' '' he said. ''She scored big right there. Few people could look at what someone was doing and say it was chicken saltimbocca.''</p>
        <p>On Nov. 7, Dr. Troyer invited Ms. Pendleton to his place on a pretext, but really to propose marriage. She was greeted by a string trio made up of her best friends, playing a Hungarian Gypsy czardas by Vittorio Monti.</p>
        <p>''The people I had do it had shared a lot of her negative relationships, and they had all been there for her when she went through them,'' Dr. Troyer said. ''I wanted them to share in the good.''</p>
