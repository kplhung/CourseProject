        <p>IT'S never a surprise when money can buy beauty. But when apartments in Manhattan that regular people can afford are flush with charm and light and space, that's another matter.</p>
        <p>Olivia Cornet and Harold Wallin are painters who had been wanting for some time to move to New York. But it was a daunting prospect. They were living quite happily in a house they had built with their own hands by a salmon stream in Alaska, 60 miles north of Anchorage. They would see eagles and moose, and sometimes bears.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wallin, after spending a number of years designing power lines for electric utilities, was painting full time. Ms. Cornet was creating scenery for opera and theater, and doing decorative painting and color consulting for individuals. Alaska had been good to them, and they loved it there.</p>
        <p>But New York is still the center of the art world, and it is difficult for ambitious people who want to keep growing to ignore it altogether. ''The gallery owners would say, 'What are you doing in Alaska?' '' Mr. Wallin said. Besides, Ms. Cornet grew up in New York, and for several years her father had been trying to lure her back.</p>
        <p>''I love New York,'' she said. ''It's my hometown.''</p>
        <p>Every time Ms. Cornet, 42, and Mr. Wallin, 43, would come for a visit, they would look at places in the usual neighborhoods -- the Upper West Side, Gramercy Park, Murray Hill.  For two years, Caroline Brown, a broker for William B. May who is an old family friend, squired them around to the neighborhoods they said they were interested in.</p>
        <p>But nothing ever seemed right. As they looked and didn't buy, prices spiraled upward, leaving them frustrated and convinced they would never be able to afford anything they liked. Studio apartments in the East 30's that needed work were going for $250,000, and they didn't want to spend that much, or live in one room.</p>
        <p>''We were just so distressed by the whole thing,'' Mr. Wallin said. Finally, Mrs. Brown decided to show them a neighborhood they had never considered, but one she had adopted in the mid-80's after living for years on the Upper East Side.</p>
        <p>She took them to her own 353-apartment co-op complex, Hudson View Gardens, on Pinehurst Avenue near West 183rd Street in Hudson Heights. She has sold dozens of apartments in the 15 Tudor-style buildings, which were constructed in 1924 and look faintly like a college campus. ''It is the most charming place anywhere,'' she said, ''and I've been around the world.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Cornet and Mr. Wallin agreed with her, and very quickly decided to buy a one-bedroom apartment with a large kitchen, formal dining room, living room, small study, bedroom and bath, for $195,000, with a maintenance of $821 month, including gas and electricity. ''Every other place would do,'' Mr. Wallin said, ''but this one felt like home.''</p>
        <p>The apartment, with its parquet and basket-weave floors and high ceilings, is similar to gracious prewar apartments in other sections of Manhattan. In fact, it reminds Ms. Cornet of her childhood apartment, on Park Avenue in the 90's. She also likes the feel of the neighborhood, high above the rest of Manhattan. When Ms. Cornet's father comes to visit, she said, he calls it ''going to the mountains.''</p>
        <p>The residents of the building are friendly and social, with frequent get-togethers and parties in the common lounge. Each apartment is still part of a central switchboard, and one resident can call another simply by dialing a four-digit extension. ''People are always introducing themselves,'' Mr. Wallin said. ''It's a real community here.''</p>
        <p>There's even a spare apartment in the complex that can be rented for guests, for less than $100 a night. There are rose gardens, a playground for children, and a warm welcome to dogs.</p>
        <p>THE surrounding neighborhood, Ms. Cornet said, ''reminds me of Carnegie Hill in the 1960's,'' when she was growing up there. They like the mix of people, and the variety of stores that provide basics,  like hardware and pizza. Even in the subway elevator, they've been struck by the small-town style of friendliness. ''People say thank you to the elevator operator,'' Mr. Wallin said, ''and he always says: 'Thank you very much. Have a great day.' ''</p>
        <p>Midtown is just 19 minutes away on the A train. There are, they say, a lot of musicians and artists in the neighborhood. But, asked whether it had the blocks filled with hip stores that usually indicate a certain concentration of artists, Mr. Wallin said, ''It's more like a hip corner,'' with restaurants like Bleu Evolution on West 187th Street near Fort Washington Avenue.</p>
        <p>It sounds too good to be true, or to be Manhattan, but Ms. Cornet and Mr. Wallin say they don't yet see any downside. Not that they've really had a chance to dig in. They bought the apartment in April, moved in in late June, but were off again in July, back to Alaska to finish the details of their move. They haven't sold their house in Alaska, but have rented it furnished to a friend.</p>
        <p>For the moment, the apartment is decorated with the American mahogany furniture that belonged to Ms. Cornet's family. Mr. Wallin has already added baseboard and some paneled molding to the living room. Ms. Cornet chose an intense yellow for the dining room, and a green for the entry hall. When she returns, she is thinking of painting some faux blue-and-white tiles showing scenes from New York harbor over the real tile in the bathroom.</p>
        <p>That kind of project, Mr. Wallin says with admiration, ''would send Olivia right to the library.'' She does enormous amounts of research for her work, she said, especially when she does sets for opera. For seven years, she painted scenery for the Anchorage opera, including an 18-by-35-foot landscape painting for ''Madama Butterfly.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Cornet graduated from Yale and moved to Alaska after going there for a wedding in 1981. ''I loved Alaska so much I stayed on,'' she said. Mr. Wallin moved there as a child because his father was in the Army; eventually, he studied art in Florence and at the Cleveland Institute. They met when they were assigned to a shared studio space at an arts center in 1988.</p>
        <p>After all these years, they have a certain Alaskan mindset. They are  accustomed to taking care of what they need and not, like New Yorkers, habituated to the kindness of superintendents. Before they moved, Mr. Wallin said, ''like a good Alaskan,'' he built himself a crate and filled it with things he might need, like a saw, a screwdriver and extension cords.</p>
        <p>''It's in the bedroom,'' he said. ''We have the TV on top.''</p>
