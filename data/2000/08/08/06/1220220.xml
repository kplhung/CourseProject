        <p>BOOKS aimed at the growing, and increasingly affluent, senior market are filling bookstore shelves around the country. Here is a sampling of recent additions, which touch on subjects from retirement to the Internet:</p>
        <p>RETIREMENT MATTERS Retiring means more than just quitting work. It is one of life's major transitions that can carry heavy-duty emotional and psychological issues, involving nothing less than a redefinition of the self. ''Breaking the Watch: The Meaning of Retirement in America,'' by Joel S. Savishinsky (Cornell University Press, $26), and ''Taking Retirement: A Beginner's Diary,'' by Carl H. Klaus (Beacon Press, $16), both grapple with the meaning and ramifications of this transition.</p>
        <p>''Breaking the Watch,'' which will be available in October, takes a broader look at retirement by exam- ining the lives of 26 people 13 men and 13 women from various backgrounds and professions in an upstate New York town. ''Taking Retirement'' is the diary of one man's efforts to come to terms with his first year of full retirement. But despite this difference in focus, both books go right to the main issues, practical and otherwise, that we all are facing or will face one day.</p>
        <p>Mr. Savishinsky, a professor of social sciences at Ithaca College, does an admirable job of interviewing his 26 retirees on a wide range of topics. Partly, he succeeds because he lets his subjects have their say. The book is divided into six major chapters and a final, smaller one, ''Conclusions: Lesson and Cautions.''</p>
        <p>One nit: The author does not use the real names of the town, which he calls ''Shelby,'' or the people he interviews. He writes that this is to protect their privacy. Well, maybe, but there are plenty of nonfiction books about considerably more controversial subjects that don't need that cover.</p>
        <p>Still, it's the voices of the retirees that power the book:</p>
        <p>''Retirement is like a progressive illness and a spiritual experience. There's a loss of efficacy, but the moral side grows.''</p>
        <p>''In retirement, it's not the watches that get broken, it's the promises. No one who talked to me about a job ever came through. I came to feel you can't rely on anyone, and I'd never felt that way before.''</p>
        <p>''I call it drift time.' It's not being in a fixed frame of work or routine. You bicycle instead of drive through life, letting each day unfold, taking you wherever it does.''</p>
        <p>''My children are so uptight. Where did I go wrong?''</p>
        <p>In ''Taking Retirement,'' Mr. Klaus, 68, a former college professor and the founder of the nonfiction writing program at the University of Iowa, uses his diary to take us inside his struggle to come to terms with a new life after 42 years of teaching. His musings chronicle the highs and lows as he copes with worries about money and health and with fears that he has been cast adrift, without the moorings of work. In the end, it is partly the work he continues to do - his writing - that lets him find balance in his new life.</p>
        <p>BITS AND BYTES For seniors who are anxious about jumping into the world of computers and the Internet, two books can be a big help.</p>
        <p>''Computer Friendly,'' by Raymond Steinbacher, is a guide for those who are really beginners. Clearly written and easy to follow, it begins with the assumption that the reader knows nothing about computers. The book is available only from the publisher, Green Tree Press in Erie, Pa., (800-834-3888). The price is $15.95, including shipping.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Modem's Internet Guide for Seniors,'' by Richard A. Sherman (Sybex, $19.99), is an excellent map for navigating the Internet. Its lists of Web sites are especially valuable. However, the book's constant efforts at cuteness can get a little tiring.</p>
        <p>SOCIAL SECURITY If you're confused by the political discourse over the future of Social Security, two books from the University of Chicago Press may help sort out the issues.</p>
        <p>''Social Security: The Phony Crisis,'' by Dean Baker and Mark Weisbrot ($22), argues that because of overly conservative economic projections, Social Security is not in danger and doesn't need to be ''saved'' by putting some of its funds into individual stock market accounts, as George W. Bush, the Republican presidential candidate, and others advocate. This is a very readable book by two economists that is actually influencing the political debate.</p>
        <p>''Making Sense of Social Security Reform,'' by Daniel N. Shaviro ($25), is due out next month and does a good job of explaining the nuts and bolts of Social Security. In the end, Mr. Shaviro, a law professor, comes down in favor of what he calls ''progressive privatization,'' in which some money would be transferred at retirement from the individual accounts of people who have done well with them to those who have not. I wouldn't want to bet on that idea getting past conservative Republicans in Congress.</p>
