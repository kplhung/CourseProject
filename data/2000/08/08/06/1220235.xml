        <p>Mountain City</p>
        <p>By Gregory Martin.</p>
        <p>193 pp. New York:</p>

        <p>Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux. $21.</p>
        <p>From Nevada's Mountain City the highway runs 84 desolate miles south to Elko with not a settlement or a house in between. North, it leads 16 miles through an Indian reservation and on up to the Idaho line. At the start of Gregory Martin's ''Mountain City'' the townspeople number 33; at the end, 31. They are old -- stranded there long after the ranches died and the mine closed.</p>
        <p>Life is Social Security checks, memories and the losing battle with time and the gale-toothed cold that holds the frost-free season to three months out of the twelve. Life is also much more than this: so we learn in Martin's crystalline memoir, written from the visits he made each summer to stay with his grandparents and lend a hand to his uncle at their general store.</p>
        <p>If you flew over Mountain City, by day it would be a scratch on a gray-brown infinity; by night a pinpoint of light. If you drove through it you would think: ugly and derelict. In prose that gives off the ''ping'' of pebbles wind-dragged across scree, Martin sketches the prospect: houses straggling along the stretch of highway that serves as the only street. Most are boarded up; the residents have moved to trailers in the yard, easier and cheaper to maintain and, above all, to heat.</p>
        <p>It has nothing to do with the American dream, or does it? Dreams end in the gray light of another day. Mountain City had its boomlets as a mining and market town, and its busts in between and afterward. It was ''a place of repetition, a Western archetype for hope and failed hope and failure.''</p>
        <p>What Martin fixes on is the dreamers awakened. Stripped of so much, these descendants of Basque shepherds and Cornish tin miners who came to Nevada to work their trades yield up nothing. Down the street each morning come the widows: four 70-year-olds, white-permed. They are off to the Miner's Club -- a bar, in fact -- to drink coffee and gossip. Martin's redoubtable Grandma, 84 and white-permed herself, finds a reason to busy herself at the back of the store so as not to see them. They are friends in all but this. Gramps, her husband, is alive, so she is excluded, and it hurts.</p>
        <p>In Mountain City, though, as in few places in America, old age is a community, but with nothing of retirement about it. You can't retire from bitter cold, frozen pipes, treacherous roads and mortality's worm, hungrier day by day. You deal with them with your dwindling stock of human cantankerousness and grace.</p>
        <p>Take Louie Arano, 72 and a Basque, or a Basco, as his people call themselves around here. He and one of Martin's uncles manufacture rawhide reins with the help of 96-year-old Stanley: the work pays some and it keeps Stanley, whom they care for solicitously, alive. A banty rooster still, Louie retorts to a breakfast waitress who gestures toward Martin and asks Louie if he's not afraid of the young competition: ''No ma'am. Stanley and I are in another league altogether. Women can feel the experience in us tugging like a magnet on their belt buckles.''</p>
        <p>Once a week Louie would mow the lawn for Lenore Zabala, in her 80's and stricken with cancer. The day she died he went straight from the funeral to her house. ''You would have seen,'' Martin writes, ''a short, old Basco pushing a lawn mower. . . . You would have noticed immediately his straight, clean, shoulder-length white hair, his finely trimmed white beard, his pressed gray suit and oiled leather shoes and thin black bolo tie. All around you would have been the smell of clippings and gasoline and morning, and you would have seen him as he turned at the end of a row, and you would have watched as his slow, measured steps moved forward across the yard.''</p>
        <p>Death is in view for everyone in Mountain City, but, in the words of an old servant in Padgett Powell's ''Edisto,'' the job is to ''live until.'' Rosella, one of the old widows, vows to avoid a lingering end, yet when she falls in her garage and shatters her hip she drags herself painfully to her Jeep, pushes herself in with the help of a broom, drives four blocks to the store, honks until Martin's aunt comes out. ''Hi, Lou,'' Rosella says. ''Listen, Lou, if it's not too much trouble, could you drive me to Elko? My hip's broken.''</p>
        <p>Living until is personified by no one more vividly than by Mel, a Basco who came to work for Gramps 40 years earlier, married his daughter and now, in his 60's, runs the store as if shoring up a dike against the tide that will prevail. One old man comes in to settle his account before he dies since, he says, he can't take his money with him. ''Now, Pete, that's true, and it isn't,'' Mel retorts. ''You can't take your money with you. But you can sure as hell take mine. . . . Which is why I'm sure glad to see you today, Pete.''</p>
        <p>Mel, whose credit system is an arcane mystery, is a performer, a showman to a dwindling house. He tells bad jokes incessantly, clowns (''Price check on aisle 29,'' he calls out as if the one-room store were a supermarket), philosophizes and exercises a difficult diplomacy. When an Indian customer persists in shoplifting Snickers bars, Lou says nothing. ''What the Old Snickerbandit doesn't know,'' he tells Martin, ''is that I've jacked up the price of baloney on him. He's been buying gourmet baloney for a long time.''</p>
        <p>Beneath the foolery is the hard lot of a 60-year-old who has to keep things going in a fading community of those older than he is. Mel can be sententious, even obnoxious, but he is both stalwart and delicate in his care for Gramps and Grandma: luminous objects of Martin's most evocative writing, and failing badly. Mel fuels himself with three Black Velvet highballs each evening. He jokes that he wants to drink more, but it is no joke. He is bone-weary -- of his own shtick, as well.</p>
        <p>Years ago the British writer Ronald Blythe (author of ''Akenfield'') conducted a series of conversations with the very old and called it ''The View in Winter.'' ''Mountain City,'' part elegy, part defiance of the elegiac, is the winter view from northern Nevada. More than anything, the old need to be touched, one of Blythe's ancients told him. Martin, whose young impatience needles his affection through nostalgia and well past it, touches and gets us to touch.</p>
