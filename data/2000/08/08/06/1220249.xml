        <p>PHOENIX</p>
        <p>A Brother's Life.</p>
        <p>By J. D. Dolan.</p>
        <p>Knopf, $22.</p>
        <p>When J. D. Dolan's estranged brother was badly burned in an explosion, Dolan was forced to come to terms with this unlikely situation, as he writes in his first book, a brave memoir, ''Phoenix.'' Decades before the accident, John -- Dolan's older brother by 11 years -- taught him how to race desert motorcycles, shoot cans off an old fender and pick out a decent automobile. As they went on to live very different lives (at one point Dolan was Cher's tour manager and John was a mechanic), they stopped talking to each other, for reasons that were never clear. By the time John landed in the hospital, they had not spoken in five years. Although ''Phoenix'' centers on John, it explores other family relationships that were strained by their father's legacy of silent punishment. Their father's reaction to confrontation was to clam up; he did not speak to his sister for 3 years, his brother for 4 and his oldest daughter for 10. Also brought to light are the inescapable and universal ''roles of childhood''; when Dolan got to the hospital where his brother was dying, he and his mother and sisters fell into their roles -- the oldest sister nurtures, the middle sisters bicker, the mother endures and the youngest sibling, Dolan himself, ''would rather be done with it quickly, then go outside and play.''</p>
