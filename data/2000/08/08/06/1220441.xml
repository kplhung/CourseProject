        <p>MARYANN SCHROPSDORFF was dressed for a little nostalgia. She had a neat blue-and-white Hawaiian-print shirt, trim jeans and soft-soled saddle shoes. Her boombox played songs like Johnny Ray's ''Cry'' and various Elvis Presley hits. For some, this may be the dog-eat-dog, make-a-hard-buck, dot-com era. But for Ms. Schropsdorff and her colleagues at the Doo-Wop Preservation League, it is always the optimistic, futuristic 1950's.</p>
        <p>Ms. Schropsdorff is a guide for the four-times-weekly Doo-Wop Tours of Wildwood's commercial architecture of the 1950's and 60's. As a trolley (actually a bus made to look like an old-time city trolley) plys the streets of the bustling resort town, Ms. Schropsdorff points out highlights, like Laura's Fudge at Wildwood and Ocean Avenues, where eye-popping neon figures, like the guy stirring a cauldron of fudge, trim the pink-and-blue roof.</p>
        <p>''People had their first cars and wanted to use them to go someplace to have fun,'' Ms. Schropsdorff said. ''Wildwood was a place to have fun, and the architecture shows it.''</p>
        <p>In an odd-couple pairing, the Mid-Atlantic Center for the Arts has combined with the Doo-Wop Preservation League for the last three summers to offer hourlong tours of the flying balconies and amoeba-shaped neon signs in Wildwood. The arts center, in Cape May, is primarily devoted to Cape May's Victorian heritage and the attendant arts.</p>
        <p>Wildwood has always had a reputation as a rowdier, more plebian resort. But in 1997, local architects, collectors and historians formed the Doo-Wop Preservation League in Wildwood. It wasn't the turrets, widow's walks and gingerbread of Victoriana they wanted to protect, but the low-rise motels, plastic palm trees and, most of all, the character of an era of joyous vacationing.</p>
        <p>''We've had to educate the public about why it's important to save Doo-Wop architecture,'' said Ellen Collins, a local architect and the executive director of the league. ''It comes from an era of great change. People were plugged into the world with their first televisions and had a little extra money. The space race was starting and Hawaii was becoming a state. Maybe you couldn't go into space, or even Hawaii. But you could get into your new Bel-Air, with the fins, and come to the beach.''</p>
        <p>So the motel proprietors of Wildwood developed the Royal Hawaiian and the Kona Kai and Wai-Ki-Ki, with its mural of that famous Hawaiian beach and its tiki-thatched roofs over every table by the pool. There were the Galaxy and the Astronaut and the Satellite, with its twinkling Sputnik-like neon.</p>
        <p>A highlight of the tour is the Caribbean Motel, at 5600 Ocean Avenue in Wildwood Crest. It has what Ms. Schropsdorff calls a Tomorrowland ramp, a spiraling outdoor concrete walkway from the street to the second-floor main office. That office has plate-glass windows that lean in from the bottom and then, at the center, seem to lean out again to the concrete canopy roof. The post-World War II era ushered in the use of reinforced concrete, used in Doo-Wop architecture to give a jutting, wing-like overhang, evoking flying off into the fantasy wilds. Starlights pepper the walkways to the rooms that surround the pool. The yellow and green trim around the motel is bright and inviting.</p>
        <p>Most important, by Ms. Collins's standard, is that the Caribbean was built in 1950, and is qualified for federal designation as a historic building. Not that anyone is planning changes in the Caribbean or most of the other motels in Wildwood, but this means it is a crucial time for preservationists.</p>
        <p>''We have a good 10-year window here,'' Ms. Collins said. ''Fifty years ago, individual motel owners fed into this great optimism that we later came to disdain here. But now, this preservation may be potentially the salvation of Wildwood as a unique resort.''</p>
        <p>Mayor Duane Sloan, is all for the preservation movement, hoping to continue to promote Wildwood as a family resort. Mr. Sloan calls the architecture Jetsonian, because of its space-age themes.</p>
        <p>Ms. Collins doesn't quibble about nomenclature, instead concentrating on education. The tours start at the league's headquarters at Pine and Pacific Avenues. Inside, visitors are greeted in an anteroom by an old TV playing advertisements of the era: ''Kool-Aid, Kool-Aid, tastes great. Kool-Aid, Kool-Aid, can't wait.'' There are pastel canvas butterfly-wing chairs, an old jukebox, a metal Pepsi cooler and a load of small appliances from the 50's. The larger room has a mock soda fountain with bicycles hung over the top.</p>
        <p>Around the room are drawings by architecture students from Yale University, the University of Pennsylvania and Kent State University about how to enhance Wildwood's Doo-Wop nature. One of Ms. Collins's favorites is a hoped-for greeting sign over the causeway into Wildwood that would have muted pink and green neon and would say on the exit side, ''See Ya Later, Alligator.''</p>
        <p>Along with the preserved motels and shops on the tour, there are new buildings designed to evoke the old era. At Schellenger and Atlantic Avenues is the new Restaurant Maureen, whose outside neon was actually suggested by a student drawing. It has a two-story martini glass with an olive in it, with other olives peppering the roofline.</p>
        <p>The Morey Organization, which runs the amusement piers on the Wildwood Boardwalk, is building the StarLux Motel at 305 East Rio Grande Avenue. It will have a flying concrete roofline above a two-story plate-glass-windowed office-lobby.  There will be plenty of what Ms. Schropsdorff calls the Wildwood miracle: plastic palm trees.</p>
        <p>On the tour, Ms. Schropsdorff ticks off favorite Doo-Wop styles. The Saratoga Motel, at Farragut and Ocean Avenues, is an example of ''phony colon-ie,'' with its brick facade and pseudo-New England cupola. The Ocean View, at Rambler Road and Ocean Avenue, has a ''blast-off roof,'' cantilevered cement coming to a peak in the middle, but flowing down banana-shaped nearly to the sidewalk. The Casa Bahama, at Orchid and Atlantic Avenues, with its connected brown-and-yellow A-frames, is an example of ''fractured geography.'' The Bahamas, as a British colony, would have no Spanish casas, Ms. Schropsdorff noted. But did anyone care? No. They were here for fun.</p>
        <p>Some of the buildings on the tour, Ms. Schropsdorff said, were inspired by their developers' vacations. The man who built the Singapore, a five-story pagoda-like structure on the Wildwood Crest beachfront at Orchid Avenue, had a great time in the Far East and wanted to bring a part of it home to the Wildwoods. One of the owners of the Hialeah, at 6211 Atlantic Avenue, apparently won a bundle betting on horses at the famed Florida racetrack. And Will Morey, whose family developed those Boardwalk amusement piers, was impressed with the dreaminess of the Disney towns in Florida and California, and built the Fantasy and Satellite Motels with them in mind.</p>
        <p>Folks are still dying to get into their cars and come on vacation, said Ms. Collins, noting that there are still at least 250 buildings and neon signs from the 1950's and 60's in Wildwood, making it the largest concentration of such structures in the country. ''To have such a wonderful setting, both nostalgic and future-looking,'' she said, ''is something we have to make sure we preserve.''</p>
