        <p>Two days after Republicans wound up their political convention with promises of tax relief, President Clinton set up an election-year battle today by vetoing as too costly a tax break for married couples that is the cornerstone of the Republican effort.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton accused the Republicans in his weekly radio address of advancing a series of ''tax giveaways'' that abandon the fiscal discipline that has helped produce the longest economic expansion in the country's history.</p>
        <p>''We can't retreat from this opportunity of a lifetime to keep our economy strong and move our country forward,'' said Mr. Clinton, who signed the veto this morning during a visit to Martha's Vineyard for a  weekend vacation and fund-raising.</p>
        <p>''That's why I'm vetoing legislation that represents the first installation of a fiscally reckless tax strategy,'' Mr. Clinton said.</p>
        <p>The veto, which Mr. Clinton had long threatened, sets the stage for a renewed partisan fight over tax policy when Congress returns to Washington after Labor Day. It is a fight  that Republicans especially view as defining the parties in both the presidential and legislative elections.</p>
        <p>John Feehery, the spokesman for House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, said Mr. Hastert planned to try to override the president's veto in the first vote. He said the veto would put pressure on House Democrats, who are competing for control of the chamber. Still, overriding it would require a two-thirds vote in both the House and Senate; neither passed the bill by such a wide margin. The vote in the Senate was 60 to 34, with seven Democrats joining all but one Republican, George V. Voinovich of Ohio, in support of the bill. In the House, the vote was 271 to 156.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton said in his radio address that the door was still open for compromise.</p>
        <p>''They've got another chance,'' he said. White House aides said they expected efforts to override the veto to fail and negotiations with the Republican leadership on a deal that would meet the president's priorities to continue through the fall.</p>
        <p>As his campaign train stopped at the station in Durand, Mich., Gov. George W. Bush of Texas called the veto yet another ''squandered opportunity'' of the Clinton administration, which he pointedly called the Clinton-Gore administration.</p>
        <p>''It sends the wrong signal in America, and yet my opponent showed us where he stands,'' said Mr. Bush, who earlier in the day had urged Vice President Al Gore to intervene against the veto. ''Instead of standing on the side of families,'' Mr. Bush said, ''he stands on the side of big government. Had I been president of the United States, I would have signed that bill.''</p>
        <p>Republicans, in their own weekly radio address, said Mr. Clinton was turning his back on married couples and perpetuating the view that the federal budget surplus belonged to the government instead of the taxpayers.</p>
        <p>''At that special and sacred moment when the bride and groom say 'I do,' they also unwittingly say 'I do' to higher taxes,'' said Representative J. D. Hayworth of Arizona.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore ''still peddle the shopworn slogan that correcting this injustice is just a break for the rich,'' Mr. Hayworth said. ''But Americans know better. We understand that two spouses earning $25,000 each are not wealthy by any stretch of the imagination.''</p>
        <p>In Westhampton, N.Y., today, Mr. Gore said: ''I'm for repealing the marriage tax, but not going beyond working families and not giving tax relief to people who are in the upper brackets and people who are not even married who are benefited by the version that was passed. I do support the veto. I also support the right kind of repeal of the marriage tax.''</p>
        <p>Both parties have plans to remedy the so-called marriage penalty, a quirk in the tax code that forces many two-income couples to pay more tax than they would as singles. But the Republican plan is broader, giving an election-year break to nearly all married couples, even those who do not pay the penalty.</p>
        <p>The issue is a sticky one for Democrats, who are seeking to walk the line between fiscal discipline and providing what is a politically popular benefit.</p>
        <p>The bill would remedy features of the tax code that force 25 million married couples to pay higher income taxes than single people, mainly by enlarging the bottom 15 percent tax bracket and increasing the standard tax deduction for couples filing jointly. But it would also cut taxes for millions of other couples who now enjoy a marriage ''bonus'' because one spouse earns the bulk of the family income.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton is urging a more modest tax-relief package intended to benefit people of low and middle incomes. He has given himself some wiggle room, however. Last month, Mr. Clinton said he would agree to the Republican tax reductions for married couples if Congress backed his proposal for a Medicare prescription drug benefit. Republicans, who have their own, less sweeping prescription drug initiative, refused.</p>
        <p>The two approaches over how to spend the record federal budget surplus mirror the turf staked out by the two presidential candidates. Mr. Gore has advocated a more modest tax-relief package than his Republican opponent. Mr. Gore has called Mr. Bush's plan risky. Mr. Bush dismisses Mr. Gore's stance as government as usual.</p>
        <p>Republicans took great pains at their convention in Philadelphia to portray themselves as an inclusive party that reaches out to people of all ethnic groups and income levels. But as Mr. Clinton stumps on behalf of Mr. Gore, he knocks the Republicans for favoring the wealthy and turning their backs on minorities. At a Friday night fund-raiser for Hillary Rodham Clinton's New York Senate campaign, he told a group of wealthy donors that Mr. Gore would not leave anybody behind.</p>
        <p>''The other guys are going to give you a bigger tax cut than we are,'' Mr. Clinton told 200 guests at the seaside gathering on Nantucket. But he said the country as a whole would be better off under Mr. Gore's stewardship, helping rich and poor alike.</p>
        <p>''We'll give you lower interest rates and a better stock market,'' the president said. ''You'll make more anyway. But I think we ought to all go along for the ride.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton compared Republican plans to spend much of the projected surplus to a foolhardy person spending sweepstakes money before the check arrived. ''Did you ever get one of those letters from Ed McMahon and Publishers Clearing House?'' Mr. Clinton asked in what has become one of his biggest applause lines of late.</p>
        <p>''Think about it: 'You may have won $10 million.' Now, if you went out the next day and spent the $10 million, you should support their program. But otherwise, you ought to stick with us.''</p>
        <p>The standoff over tax cuts is a repeat of past end-of-the-year budget confrontations, which Mr. Clinton has shown himself quite adept at maneuvering.</p>
        <p>But in this case, the Republicans profess to be relishing the fight.</p>
        <p>''House Democrats will have an opportunity to get rid of the marriage penalty by overriding the veto,'' Mr. Feehery said. ''It's going to be a tough fight. We're going to expose their real proclivity for higher taxes.''</p>
        <p>Some Democrats praised the president's action as fiscally prudent. Senator Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat, called Mr. Clinton ''wise to veto tax cuts that are not directed at the middle class.''</p>
