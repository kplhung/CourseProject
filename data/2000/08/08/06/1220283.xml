        <p>SPARE me the spread of the bronzed, muscle-bound lifeguard and show me something I may not know about before visiting Sydney, such as the saltwater sea pools, built barely out of reach of the breakers, at many of the city's ocean beaches.</p>
        <p>Guides to the host city of the 2000 Olympic Games are plentiful at the moment, but the best go beyond being just visually resplendent. Photos and graphics in these provide context, and are illustrative and informative rather than merely decorative. I can pardon the occasional close-up shot of a koala nibbling gum leaves, for example, but it is a delight to see giraffes or elephants against the backdrop of Sydney's skyline and harbor afforded by the Taronga Zoo. I'm also more tempted to visit a museum by a visual preview of a few of the works in its collection rather than a photo of its facade.</p>

        <p>SPARE me the spread of the bronzed, muscle-bound lifeguard and show me something I may not know about before visiting Sydney, such as the saltwater sea pools, built barely out of reach of the breakers, at many of the city's ocean beaches.</p>
        <p>Guides to the host city of the 2000 Olympic Games are plentiful at the moment, but the best go beyond being just visually resplendent. Photos and graphics in these provide context, and are illustrative and informative rather than merely decorative. I can pardon the occasional close-up shot of a koala nibbling gum leaves, for example, but it is a delight to see giraffes or elephants against the backdrop of Sydney's skyline and harbor afforded by the Taronga Zoo. I'm also more tempted to visit a museum by a visual preview of a few of the works in its collection rather than a photo of its facade.</p>
        <p>The Sydney guides I prefer also tell visitors intriguing things they might miss, like what stages the Sydney Harbour Bridge was built in and in what time spans, or tips about the different styles of Aboriginal art. De rigueur, too, are detailed accounts of excursions to nearby areas, like the majestic Blue Mountains about 65 miles to the west and the breathtaking juxtaposition of bush and waterways in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park about 19 miles to the north.</p>
        <p>I'll pass altogether on the Sydney guides whose pages are enlivened by little more than bold-face type or sporadic clumps of color pictures.</p>
        <p>It's well worth spending the extra $5 to $10 for a thorough and thoughtfully produced book.</p>
        <p>THE NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC TRAVELER SYDNEY, by Evan McHugh. 271 pages. 1999. (National Geographic Society, $22.95.)</p>
        <p>As one would expect from the publisher, this handsome travel guide is impeccably appointed with bold and relevant color art. Even a relatively small photo in the Eastern Suburbs section places picnickers not only in Nielsen Park but also under the canopy of an outsize Moreton Bay fig tree, with the gables of Greycliffe House, an 1852 residence that now houses the National Parks and Wildlife Service office, visible in the background. Now, that's context! It also has the most comprehensive section on the Olympic site as well as an Olympic Survival Guide. (Don't forget the bottled water and the aspirin!)</p>
        <p>Yet what really makes this one of the top two Sydney city books is that Evan McHugh, a native Sydneysider, goes the extra mile to provide the unexpected: a comprehensive section on Aboriginal art; a section on where to view noteworthy artists' renditions of Sydney Harbour; a short history of the area's shipwrecks.</p>
        <p>Toward the back there are miniportraits and profiles of Sydney's principal wildlife -- most of the species charming, as the venomous funnel web spider is noteworthy in its absence here. (Mr. McHugh deals with these and such other nasty creatures as sharks right up front under the heading A Few Precautions.) My only disappointment is that the hotel and restaurant listings, while succinct and informative, could use a bit of the dazzling photographs that are so prominent elsewhere.</p>
        <p>DORLING KINDERSLEY TRAVEL GUIDES SYDNEY. 264 pages. 2000. (Dorling Kindersley, $19.95.)</p>
        <p>I was happy to see a few interiors pictured among the restaurants and hotels in this top-tier Sydney guide, then amazed to see that the book's contributors were considerate enough to show what your plate is liable to look like if you order, say, char-grilled kangaroo fillets, Chinese Yum Cha dumplings, freshwater crayfish or the classic Australian pavlova dessert of meringue, cream and fruit. Likewise with beverages: It explains with pictures as well as words the difference between a middy of beer (10 fluid ounces) and the more daunting 15-fluid-ounce schooner, among other gustatory guidelines.</p>
        <p>It's all in the details here. The segment on beaches -- and Sydney warrants one of these -- shows the varieties of waves and the level of swimming skills it takes to negotiate them. The topographic map of Paddington indicates exactly where to glimpse the terrace and gingerbread houses the neighborhood is famous for. Close-up photographs and graphics allow readers to get accustomed to the different currency before they arrive; sample a float from the Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras; look at size charts and see that an Australian women's size 14 is equivalent to an American 12; learn how to operate a pay phone, and how to spot an Australian policeman. The menacing funnel web spider even makes a relatively innocent appearance -- among the displays at the Australian Museum.</p>
        <p>Information about the Olympic Games, however, is relatively scant, and I was sorry not to see Sydney's most spectacular harbor walk, the Manly Scenic Walkway, mapped out the way it is in the National Geographic guide. (The authors chose to focus on a less worthy ramble around the seaside resort town of Manly itself.) Fortunately, my other favorite, the Bondi Beach to Clovelly cliffside walk, has two pages devoted to it.</p>
        <p>SYDNEY IN A WEEK, by Wendy Moore. 176 pages. 1997. (New Holland Publishers, $24.95.)</p>
        <p>Wendy Moore's ''Ultimate Guide to Sydney,'' as the subtitle proclaims, does not quite have everything you'll need. The author's written sketches, while useful, tend to be thumbnail, and diners are encouraged to look elsewhere if they want more than minimal information about restaurants.</p>
        <p>That said, this is one of my favorite books on Sydney, and there is a practical reason behind its somewhat impractical 8 3/4-by-11-inch size.</p>
        <p>Its seven sections on sightseeing,  organized by day, are illustrated with spectacular, full-blown color photographs. A visitor might look at the aerial photo of the peninsula that culminates in South Head at the entrance to Sydney Harbour, for example -- with breakers on one side and crystalline coves on the other -- and decide to spend the last day checking out this landscape in the Eastern Suburbs rather than the more commercial, less aesthetically pleasing Darling Harbour.</p>
        <p>I was particularly excited about the aerial vistas of different districts of Sydney, most covering two-page spreads, in which neighborhoods and landmarks are prominently labeled. My husband, who is Australian,  laughs at me, but these orient me  much better than conventional maps. They also show something of the character of neighborhoods and how they fit into the grand scheme of Sydney. In addition, there are plenty of traditional maps for people like my husband, and a variety of special itineraries for the adventurous, including harborside walks.</p>
        <p>LONELY PLANET SYDNEY (CONDENSED). 128 pages. 2000. (Lonely Planet Publications, $9.95.)</p>
        <p>The best of the so-called pocket guides, although its nearly eight-inch height makes it better suited to a purse, this slim book should not be confused with the publisher's adequate but unarresting full-length version, or judged by its homely front and back covers. The covers, in fact, fold out and harbor a variety of useful maps.</p>
        <p>There's too much impractical, sometimes careless artwork here -- one caption claims that beach views are a draw at a certain restaurant, but there's nary a shore in sight in the photo, which focuses on a wine bottle and glass. However, there is a lot to like about this book, including an eight-page insert about the Olympic Games. For hungry Game-goers  who can't find places at the more popular restaurants, this section offers a list of suburban streets where the many and varied restaurants will probably have tables. The contributors also note the Olympics events, such as the Marathon, which can be seen free of charge.</p>
        <p>There is a page on Quirky Sydney here, which is good for an entertaining read even if you don't want to visit a wig and clothing shop for drag queens, and parents will appreciate the facing page, which covers Sydney for Children, complete with the name and number of an agency for reliable baby sitters and nannies. Restaurants are listed by neighborhood. I was initially puzzled not to be able to locate two of my favorite eating establishments -- Bathers Pavilion and Forty One -- then relieved to see them on a separate restaurant page entitled Outstanding Views, only with no sign of their vistas.</p>
        <p>Most of the basic facts for travelers are condensed in the back of the guide, even access numbers for major servers and a list of Internet cafes.</p>
        <p>SHOPPING SECRETS: SYDNEY EDITION, by Michelle Matthews. 130 pages. 1999. (Shopping Secrets, $14.95.)</p>
        <p>Like any international city, Sydney has a wealth of retail outlets, but it never struck me as an intriguing shopping town until I saw this engaging guide. Grouping stores by neighborhood, Ms. Matthews steers buyers beyond the Benettons and other international chains so they can make a beeline for the most unusual wares Sydney has to offer. Complementing Ms. Matthews's snappy writing style are crisp, almost tactile photos by Rupert Lorhaldar.</p>
        <p>Many of the products on offer here are indigenous to Australia. There is an espresso bar where the handmade furniture you sit on is for sale, and a store specializing in anything made from Australian cotton, for example. Yet the book also tells you where to find the best French imports, Soviet memorabilia and Swedish designs. Among the 113 rather esoteric businesses to choose from are an upscale sex shop; a boutique of unusual buttons; a lounge where you can go with friends and a bottle of wine to make your own pottery; a bottled-water purveyor with 100 varieties; and a consignment shop for recycled designer clothes.</p>
        <p>Information on each store includes address, telephone and fax numbers and hours, but does not include prices. The latter are apt to change; besides, as in a store window, a lack of price tag can draw you into the store to ask. For richer or, most likely, for poorer, this fashionably slim book should accompany the acquisitive to Sydney. It is available in the United States only at www. amazon.com or at its own Web site, www.shoppingsecrets.com, but it is sold in bookstores in Australia.</p>
        <p>IN A SUNBURNED COUNTRY, by Bill Bryson. 307 pages. 2000. (Broadway Books, $25.)</p>
        <p>The flight to Sydney is long -- about 14 hours nonstop just from Los Angeles -- but the travel writer and humorist Bill Bryson's vastly entertaining takes on Australia should make it elapse swiftly. The only risk is that laughing aloud may intrigue neighboring passengers, possibly engaging them in unwanted conversation, or simply make them irked that they're not having fun, too.</p>
        <p>If there is one book with which to get oriented before departure or en route to Australia, this is it. Mr.  Bryson celebrates the quirks -- in history, in culture, in flora and fauna -- that together give Australia its eccentric character. He pokes gentle fun at Lachlan Macquarie, governor of the colony in the early 19th century, after whom lakes, streets, you-name-it are named. He mines the humor inherent in Australia's abundance of extravagantly toxic creatures such as the 10 most deadly poisonous snakes on the planet, box jellyfish and the blue-ringed octopus.  He takes us into the store that sells pet supplies and pornography in a small country town.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bryson's droll point of view even renders past events palatable for nonhistory buffs: I'd never known that the explorer Jean-Francois de la Perouse just missed claiming Australia for France, thus, notes Mr. Bryson, saving the country from 200 years of English cooking.</p>
