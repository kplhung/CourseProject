        <p>Dr Irwin Redlener letter on National Health Service Corps scholarship program that financially helps young doctors who agree to work in needy areas for at least two years (July 30 article)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re your July 30 front-page article about doctors who work with the poor: Although the National Health Service Corps does offer loan repayment for medical professionals, much of its work involves identifying highly dedicated medical and health professional students who apply for special scholarships.</p>
        <p>This assistance makes medical school possible for young people who might otherwise not be able to afford tuition. When training is complete, they ''pay back'' the scholarship by working in a needy area for at least two years. This benefits everyone, particularly communities with little chance to recruit adequate health care professionals in any other way.</p>

        <p>This program has never received sufficient attention -- or resources. With the current budget surplus, communities in trouble and clinicians willing to serve, it is time to provide the corps with the support it deserves.</p>
