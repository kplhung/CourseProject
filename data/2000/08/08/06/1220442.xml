        <p>As students get ready for the start of the college year, they -- or their parents -- will find that the cost of higher education in the state is getting higher. All of the public and private four-year colleges in New Jersey are raising tuition this fall.</p>
        <p>Increases range from a high of 10 percent at Rowan and Montclair, both public universities, to a low of 3.2 percent at Princeton University, which is already the state's most expensive institution of higher education, according to the Commission on Higher Education.</p>
        <p>Still, the increases should come as no surprise. ''Most schools raise tuition every year,'' said Janice Gams, associate director of public affairs for the College Board in New York City. ''People should be prepared for that.''</p>
        <p>The average increase nationally last year was 3.4 percent for public colleges and 4.6 percent for private ones, according to the College Board, a nonprofit education association of schools and colleges that administers the SAT tests.</p>
        <p>''College tuition rates regularly increase at more than the rate of inflation because colleges are labor-intensive and technology-intensive and both are expensive,'' Ms. Gams said. ''It is unfair to compare tuition increases to the Consumer Price Index because consumers have a lot of different kinds of things to buy that don't apply to schools.''</p>
        <p>Most colleges cite the costs of new buildings and equipment, particularly computers, and salaries as the chief reasons for the rise in tuition costs.</p>
        <p>Rowan University in Glassboro, where tuition will be $4,140 for the coming school year -- a 10.4 percent increase -- is in the fifth year of a five-year program that called for 10 percent tuition increases each year.</p>
        <p>''Students, faculty and administration all wanted to do this,'' said Jose Cardona, director of university relations for Rowan. ''We increased faculty, added six new master's programs, improved other academic offerings, added computers and increased financial aid for students.''</p>
        <p>He said he did not know if tuition at Rowan, where enrollment was capped at about 9,300, would increase again next year.</p>
        <p>The second highest increase will be paid by students at Montclair State University, where tuition will go up 10 percent, to $3,470.</p>
        <p>''The need for additional academic programs and facility renovations forced the increase,'' said Phyllis Miller, a university spokeswoman. ''Technology costs and salary costs are increasing.''</p>
        <p>Montclair State is buying land in Little Falls to build additional housing for 600 students because of growing enrollment, which went up 20 percent last year and will grow another 6 percent this fall to about 13,500. The school anticipates that enrollment will increase by another 2,500 within three to four years, she said.</p>
        <p>''We used to have the lowest tuition in the state and we are still the second lowest, even with the increase,'' Ms. Miller said.</p>
        <p>The lowest rate will be paid by students at Richard Stockton College of New Jersey in Pomona, where the third largest increase --  9.8 percent -- will bring tuition to $3,375.</p>
        <p>However, two factors could reduce that cost. The college recently started its most ambitious fund-raising program to date by holding a contest to win the right to name the college gymnasium. So far $250,000 has been raised toward the $1 million goal.</p>
        <p>An additional $1 million that had not been included in the budget was obtained from the State Legislature on the premise the money would be used to help hold down tuition costs for the 6,300 students at the school. The board of trustees will meet later this month to decide the final tuition cost, said Tim Kelly, college spokesman.</p>
        <p>The state's oldest and largest public college, Rutgers University, with 48,700 students, will raise tuition 5 percent. As at most of the institutions, room and board and some fees will also go up this fall.</p>
        <p>Rutgers and other public colleges receive substantial financing from the state, although not as much as in some other states, college representatives say. At Rutgers, 60 percent of operating costs are paid by the state, while Montclair and some other schools receive 50 percent or less of their operating revenue from the state.</p>
        <p>Public universities and colleges in general would like two-thirds of the costs to be covered by the state, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education.</p>
        <p>This year the state is increasing aid for operating expenses for public schools by 6.2 percent, to $1.2 billion. Aid to private colleges and to the 19 community colleges was also increased.</p>
        <p>Tuition at all the public colleges except  Stockton and at 8 of the state's 14 private colleges last year exceeded the national average, which was $3,110 for public schools and $13,392 for private schools, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education.</p>
        <p>With a 3.2 percent increase in tuition rates, a year at Princeton will cost $25,430. Costs at Drew University, $23,472 for a 4.5 percent increase, and Stevens Institute of Technology, $21,900 for a 4.8 percent increase, are not far behind.</p>
        <p>County colleges announced earlier this summerthat tuition would hold steady at 11 schools and would actually decrease by 7.1 percent at Sussex County Community College. Increases at the remainder range up to 3.4 percent. The state is in the third year of a four-year plan to increase the state subsidy for county colleges to one-third of the operating costs. The state now pays for 29 percent of the costs.</p>
        <p>The Commission on Higher Education, which does not set tuition rates, encourages schools to keep rates as low as possible, said Judy Savage, commission spokeswoman. But ''we also recognize keeping institutions strong requires an ongoing investment.''</p>
