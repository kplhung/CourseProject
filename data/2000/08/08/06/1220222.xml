        <p>Women are significantly less effective than men in doling out discipline to subordinates at work, according to a new study.</p>
        <p>The study, ''Gender and Discipline in the Workplace: Wait Till Your Father Gets Home,'' will be presented tomorrow at the Academy of Management meeting in Toronto. It was based on interviews with 163 employees  68 women and 95 men who had been disciplined by supervisors in all types of job settings.</p>
        <p>''In general, situations involving females delivering discipline are perceived by recipients to be less effective over all,'' conclude the authors, Leanne E. Atwater, James A. Carey and David Waldman of the School of Management at Arizona State University West in Phoenix. The authors said the issue had received no attention before their research.</p>
        <p>Concerning fairness, 58 percent of those interviewed thought the punishment was unfair from a female manager, while 42 percent thought it was fair; 44 percent thought it was unfair from a male manager, while 56 percent thought it was fair.</p>
        <p>Thirty-six percent thought the women mishandled the discipline, while only 18 percent thought the same of the men. Over all, 40 percent thought the women were effective, while 57 percent thought the men were.</p>
        <p>The authors conducted a follow-up study to see if the results reflected real differences in the way men and women administer discipline, or merely reflected biases of the recipients.</p>
        <p>In the follow-up, business students were asked to put themselves in the shoes of a recipient of discipline concerning a dresscode violation. In one case, the manager quietly pulled aside the employee to talk about the violation. In another, the manager loudly berated the employee in front of co-workers. Participants could have had male or female supervisors.</p>
        <p>For the most part, the authors said, the follow-up determined that there was some bias, but that ''stereotypes do not appear to be pronounced.'' It did find that when the female manager handled the situation appropriately, both male and female participants were angrier that a woman delivered it, Ms. Atwater said.</p>
        <p>Over all, the authors said, the possibility that female supervisors behave differently than males ''cannot be ruled out.'' More women are now being placed in the unfamiliar role of having to impose discipline, Ms. Atwater said.</p>
        <p>''Women may need specific training in how to integrate this type of behavior'' into their management skills, she added.</p>
