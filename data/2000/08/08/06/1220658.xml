        <p>In an effort to save money for Medicare, the Clinton administration is planning to cut payments for anticancer drugs administered to patients in doctors' offices. This could affect hundreds of thousands of elderly patients.</p>
        <p>The move has provoked an outcry from patients, doctors, nurses and members of Congress, who say the cuts will make it financially impossible for many cancer specialists to provide chemotherapy in their offices.</p>
        <p>Donna E. Shalala, the secretary of health and human services, says the cuts are justified because Medicare, the federal health insurance program for the elderly and disabled, is paying too much for the drugs -- far more than doctors pay for many of the medicines.</p>
        <p>Dr. Shalala said the government would reduce the ''excessive Medicare payments'' later this year, perhaps as early as Oct. 1, because federal investigators had obtained more accurate data showing what doctors actually paid for the drugs.</p>
        <p>Doctors said they would send many of their Medicare patients to hospitals for treatment, causing inconvenience to patients while increasing costs to Medicare.</p>
        <p>Representative Nita M. Lowey, Democrat of New York, said: ''I am very concerned about the impact of these cuts on cancer patients. Many oncologists will find that it's financially impossible to provide chemotherapy services in their offices.''</p>
        <p>Doctors confirm that they receive more than they pay for some drugs, but insist that the extra payments are essential to cover chemotherapy costs not reimbursed by Medicare.</p>
        <p>The dispute illustrates the passions aroused when the fate of cancer patients gets mixed up in debates over drug prices and doctors' income.</p>
        <p>At least 120 members of Congress -- 69 Republicans and 51 Democrats -- have signed letters to Dr. Shalala expressing alarm about the administration's plans. Many complained that the administration appeared to be acting unilaterally, without soliciting public comment, as agencies usually do before making major changes in federal regulations.</p>
        <p>Dr. Joseph S. Bailes, former president of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, which represents 15,000 cancer specialists, urged the White House to ''reconsider and rescind these cuts.'' He estimated that 750,000 Medicare beneficiaries received chemotherapy in doctors' offices each year. Most have cancer of the breast, colon or lung.</p>
        <p>Chris Jennings, the health policy coordinator at the White House, said he was not surprised at the criticism from cancer specialists because they derived substantial amounts of income from Medicare's payments for drugs. He said the White House had asked Medicare officials to assess whether the cuts would harm access to care or the quality of care.</p>
        <p>''Patients should not be hurt in any way, but taxpayers should get a fair deal,'' Mr. Jennings said in an interview this week. ''The current reimbursement policy is unsustainable. It's appropriate to reimburse doctors for the cost of the drugs they purchase, but they should not be allowed to mark up the price by 20, 70 or 700 percent, as they do now in some cases.''</p>
        <p>A 1997 study by the Department of Health and Human Services said that Medicare payments for 22 drugs, including many cancer drugs, exceeded the actual wholesale prices by 29 percent, or $447 million, in 1996. For 8 of the 22 drugs, it said, Medicare paid more than twice the actual wholesale price.</p>
        <p>In the last decade, most cancer chemotherapy has shifted from hospitals to doctors' offices. Doctors say the cuts in Medicare payments would reverse that trend.</p>
        <p>Medicare's policy is important for two reasons. At least half of all patients receiving chemotherapy in this country are on Medicare, cancer experts said. Private insurers, which cover other patients, often follow the government's example and could be expected to lower their reimbursement rates as well.</p>
        <p>''This is not just a threat to the Medicare program,'' Dr. Bailes said. ''It's a threat to cancer care in general.''</p>
        <p>Ellen L. Stovall, executive director of the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship, a patients' group, said, ''I'm not interested in helping the physician make more money, but I am worried that patients may have less access to care as an inevitable and unintended consequence of these cuts.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Barton C. McCann, who was the chief medical officer of the Medicare program from 1986 to 1998, said the cuts ''may have the unintended consequence of making it financially impossible for oncologists to treat patients in their offices.'' If Medicare beneficiaries cannot receive chemotherapy there, Dr. McCann said, they will seek it at hospitals, where care is more expensive, and ''total costs to the Medicare program could rise'' as a result.</p>
        <p>Medicare generally does not pay for prescription drugs outside a hospital, but there are exceptions. Medicare does, for example, pay for drugs provided ''incident to a physician's service,'' including cancer drugs given to patients by injection or infusion in a doctor's office.</p>
        <p>Doctors receive separate payments for the drugs and for the service provided when they or their nurses administer the drugs.</p>
        <p>The doctors acknowledge that they can buy some cancer drugs, especially older drugs, at prices lower than what Medicare pays. But, they say, Medicare pays much less than what it costs to administer the drugs. Federal officials agree that the doctors' ''practice expenses,'' including the costs of medical staff, supplies and equipment, far exceed the amounts recognized by Medicare.</p>
        <p>For years, doctors say, the markup on cancer drugs has partly offset the inadequacy of the payments for administering chemotherapy.</p>
        <p>Before 1998, Medicare paid doctors the average wholesale price of cancer drugs. Payments were reduced by a 1997 law, which said that Medicare would pay ''95 percent of the average wholesale price,'' but the law did not specify how that price should be determined.</p>
        <p>In 1999 and again this year, President Clinton proposed a further cut. He wanted to pay 83 percent of the average wholesale price. Mr. Clinton said that would ''eliminate the physician markup for outpatient drugs.'' Dr. Shalala said the cut would save Medicare $2.9 billion over 10 years.</p>
        <p>Congress has rejected that approach, but Clinton administration officials said they had found a way to achieve a similar result by different means. They intend to redefine ''average wholesale price'' to reflect the lower prices that they now believe are available to doctors.</p>
        <p>For years, the government obtained wholesale prices from trade publications like the Red Book, published by Medical Economics, a unit of the Thomson Corporation.</p>
        <p>Representatives Saxby Chambliss, Republican of Georgia, and Ken Bentsen, Democrat of Texas, said ''wholesale price'' was understood by Congress to mean the price listed in such publications.</p>
        <p>But now, Dr. Shalala said, the government will use the data it recently obtained from catalogs of certain drug wholesalers. The Justice Department compiled the data in an investigation of drug pricing under Medicaid, a separate program.</p>
        <p>By redefining ''average wholesale price'' in this way, federal officials said, they can reduce payments for drugs without any change in federal law or regulations.</p>
        <p>''This is the most immediate action we can take without undergoing the formal rule-making process,'' Dr. Shalala said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chambliss said the question of how to pay for cancer drugs had been repeatedly addressed by Congress in the last few years. ''It is,'' he said, ''disturbing that the Department of Health and Human Services would seek to circumvent those Congressional actions by unilaterally adopting a new definition of average wholesale price.''</p>
