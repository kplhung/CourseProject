        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Could Carole Berglie [Letters, July 30] have attended another Maryinsky Theater? Or perhaps visited another St. Petersburg? My wife and I went to two wonderful ballets at the Maryinsky three weeks ago. The crowd was as quiet and attentive as at any theater anywhere. We had no objection to the two-level pricing. If there were Russian ''nouveau riches'' who could have afforded the higher-priced tourist tickets, they were far outnumbered by the Russians who looked like even the subsidized tickets represented a luxury. Anyone spending any time in the city can see that life is a struggle for its residents. But you don't have to be observant to find the snacks that Ms. Berglie wants. All you have to do is go to the third level of the theater and you will find sandwiches, pastries, drinks and, yes, vodka and caviar. There are even tables and chairs, which are lacking at Carnegie Hall, Avery Fisher and the Met. St. Petersburg has a deep and rich cultural heritage that it has maintained during 85 years of trial and hardship. The citizens clearly cherish and support their ballet, opera and symphony orchestra. I would urge anyone with an interest in European culture to visit St. Petersburg. And I would tell them to go to the Maryinsky Theater.</p>
