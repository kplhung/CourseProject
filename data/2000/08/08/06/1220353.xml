        <p>Martha Clara Vineyards, a North Fork producer that went into business last year, has released its 1999 viognier ($15), which, following in the light footsteps of a 1998 predecessor, is pleasing and promising.</p>
        <p>This white wine, 88 percent viognier (pronounced VEE-awn-yay), is bolstered by 12 percent chardonnay grapes, all estate grown. It is bone-dry, delicately fruity, creamy, enlivened by a faint spritz and as light as Italian pinot grigio.</p>

        <p>Martha Clara Vineyards, a North Fork producer that went into business last year, has released its 1999 viognier ($15), which, following in the light footsteps of a 1998 predecessor, is pleasing and promising.</p>
        <p>This white wine, 88 percent viognier (pronounced VEE-awn-yay), is bolstered by 12 percent chardonnay grapes, all estate grown. It is bone-dry, delicately fruity, creamy, enlivened by a faint spritz and as light as Italian pinot grigio.</p>
        <p>A young wine, it needs more time in bottle to tame its acidity. In the meantime, because of that acidity, it will wash down any number of fish dishes satisfactorily.</p>
        <p>Martha Clara's '99 gewurztraminer ($16), one of the few made on Long Island, has a grip on the gewurztraminer idea: the famous litchi flavor, the spiciness, is there. But the wine is slight. If this year's vintage is rich and ripe, the grape can be used to fuller advantage next time around.</p>
        <p>Because Martha Clara does not yet have its own winery, the wines were made at the Wolffer Estate (Sagpond Vineyards) by its winemaker, Roman Roth.</p>
        <p>A total of 112 acres of 11 kinds of grapes are grown both on Robert Entenmann's 135-acre Big E Farm in Riverhead and on his 40 Martha Clara acres in Mattituck.</p>
        <p>If the renovation of an old barn on the Mattituck property marches ahead on schedule, it will open as a tasting room this fall. ''When the barn is finished, we'll give vineyard tours,'' Mr. Entenmann said. Next year, a winery and another tasting room are to rise next to the barn, but the barn room is likely to be used for tastings, too.</p>
        <p>Martha Clara is at 2595 Sound Avenue in Mattituck. Information: (631) 298-0075.</p>
