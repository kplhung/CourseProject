        <p>AND STILL WE RISE</p>
        <p>The Trials and Triumphs</p>
        <p>of Twelve Gifted Inner-City High School Students.</p>
        <p>By Miles Corwin.</p>
        <p>418 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>William Morrow &amp; Company. $25.</p>
        <p>Having had his fill of violence from years as a crime reporter, in 1996 and 1997 Miles Corwin sat in on a year's worth of English classes for gifted students at Crenshaw High School in South Central Los Angeles. The students he profiles in ''And Still We Rise'' come from the same streets as the pitiless and pitiful teenage murderers he documented in his previous book, ''The Killing Season,'' but for the most part they determinedly sidestep the community's pitfalls.</p>
        <p>Corwin sets out to show how some students manage to maintain their grades and hone their academic intelligence in spite of adult-size pressures. Olivia, the outstanding student of her computer science and English classes, is so charismatic and so unguarded about her past that she becomes the student we get to know best. She left her abusive mother at the age of 12 and, aside from brief stays in foster homes, has mostly lived on her own ever since. What sinks Olivia is not her set of circumstances (which press but never crush her) but her attempt to pass forged checks. She is caught and locked up, and, unable to get back to her advanced placement classes, loses her scholarship to a college she has idealized. (The happy ending: she is released in time to attend a state university in the fall, and ultimately regains the scholarship to her dream college.)</p>
        <p>Corwin devotes a couple of chapters to arguing the case for affirmative action in college admissions; California's dismantling of it through Proposition 209 has affected these very students, who, by the evidence of the classroom discussions, are as smart and capable as any high school kids anywhere. But what he does best is eavesdrop on two particularly exciting classrooms: that of Toni Little, a teacher whose candor, enthusiasm and egocentricity make her entertaining, inspiring and often obnoxious; and that of her rival, Anita Moultrie, or, as her gifted 11th-graders affectionately refer to her, Mama Moultrie. Little is white; Moultrie black. Little's seniors, whom she drives toward formal interpretations of the classics, love her in spite of herself, and are intimate enough with her to tell her to chill out when she rants about her problems.</p>
        <p>Moultrie, on the other hand, is a ''radicalized'' teacher who uses black literature and imaginative themes to awaken students' recognition of themselves and their connection to the world. Whereas Little's religion is literature -- If you read 20 classic novels since the 10th grade, do you have a greater advantage to determine what is right or wrong? I think you do'' -- Moultrie's is undisguised Christianity. ''I love all of you. I love you with the love of Christ,'' she tells her class, and, ''You are our community's best hope.''</p>
        <p>It isn't until the end of the book that Corwin addresses his own presence in the unfolding story. We know he's there -- recording the wonderful dynamics of Little's classroom (he was only an occasional drop-in in Moultrie's) or accompanying Olivia to juvenile court -- but how does his presence affect the behavior of the students? The ones he features by name have cooperated with the consent of their parents, but they seem protected from the</p>
        <p>3-D exposure that the exuberant Little and Olivia seem to bask in. One small comedy in the book, which forces Corwin to give up his pretended (and sometimes jarring) journalistic invisibility, occurs when, during an extended absence of Little's, he reluctantly takes over the class from an unprepared series of substitutes in the teaching of ''Hamlet.''</p>
        <p>''And Still We Rise'' isn't the book it could be -- Corwin's emotional involvement with the students should have been part of the story -- but readers have to be grateful for the abundance of classroom dialogue that is unexpected, fresh and interesting, and fine portraits, as good as fiction, of two teachers and one student.</p>
