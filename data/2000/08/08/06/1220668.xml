        <p>United Nations peacekeeping troops finally began spreading out in force along Lebanon's border with Israel today, after weeks of haggling over just where the border is and 22 years after their presence was first authorized.</p>
        <p>Convoys of white-painted armored vehicles began snaking through the stony hills of southern Lebanon, occupied until May 24 by the Israeli Army and its proxy local militia, shortly after 6 a.m., carrying about 700 United Nations troops.</p>
        <p>Over the last week, a smaller vanguard, in platoon strength of about 30 soldiers each, had taken up six positions along the border.</p>
        <p>By nightfall, the operation was proceeding smoothly, with the most serious incident being a brush fire that had detonated three land mines near a newly established position of Indian troops.</p>
        <p>But the troop movement was halted after nine hours because of land mines and because of the reluctance of a number of local landlords to rent out their land for new United Nations positions, fearing they would not be compensated by the Lebanese government, United Nations officials said.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, officials said, the troop movement, which is to resume on Monday went smoothly.</p>
        <p>Hezbollah guerrillas, the effective force on the ground, quietly turned over the fortified strongholds and observation posts they had taken when the Israelis abruptly departed two months ago, leaving the Christian-led militia called the South Lebanon Army to flee in their wake.</p>
        <p>Hezbollah, or Party of God, drawn from the regions predominately Shiite Muslim population, had already pledged to cooperate with the United Nations deployment and the expected sending of Lebanese Army soldiers and police to fill the security vacuum left when Israeli forces left in May after a 22-year occupation.</p>
        <p>''But the guerrillas are not giving up their weapons, which they will stash away in their homes and other hiding places,'' a Hezbollah official said.</p>
        <p>''The arms of the resistance will remain steadily within reach in the equation, but they will be kept invisible,'' the official said.</p>
        <p>The full deployment of troops from the Indian, Irish, Fijian, Nepalese and Ghanaian battalions of the command formally known as United Nations Interim force in Lebanon, or Unifil, is expected to take several days to a week.</p>
        <p>The force is being expanded from  about 4,600 troops to about 6,000, including a detachment of Ukrainian soldiers sent to dig up the land mines scattered around the area.</p>
        <p>A Lebanese force of 500 soldiers and 500 security police is supposed to follow the United Nations troops into the south some 24 hours after the United Nations sets up its posts.</p>
        <p>''We are ready for it now but we want to see where Unifil deploys so our special force knows where to go,'' Lebanese Prime Minister Salim al-Hoss said.</p>
