        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re your Aug. 3 editorial about Senator Robert G. Torricelli's brief bid for governor of New Jersey:</p>
        <p>You suggest that one of the reasons for the struggle among the New Jersey Democrats was the settling of old scores. There's an element of truth in that, as any politician as tough and as savvy as Senator Torricelli is bound to ruffle a few feathers. But Representative Robert Menendez's actions in rallying support for James E. McGreevey, the near-winner in the 1997 governor's race and presumptive front-runner in 2001, are better understood as a demonstration of loyalty.</p>

        <p>Perhaps the most surprising aspect of the skirmish was Senator Torricelli's miscalculations of the depth of Mr. McGreevey's resolve and of the loyalty he has engendered. No doubt Mr. Torricelli's considerable duties in Washington contributed to his disconnect with the political realities back home.</p>
