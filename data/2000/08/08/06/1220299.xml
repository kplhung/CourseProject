        <p>THE first week of her freshman year at Cornell University, Kate Wilkinson of Plymouth, Mass., made a big mistake. She agreed to play Trivial Pursuit with several other students in her dormitory. Kate was embarrassed that she did not know what element was converted to plutonium in the first nuclear reactor, what onetime Yugoslav republic is shaped like a boomerang or even the longest American war. Far worse, everyone else did (or seemed to).</p>
        <p>Kate called her mother and, between sobs, gave voice to her fear that she was not smart enough to succeed at the university.</p>
        <p>While some first-year students experience little or no anxiety, most freshmen have a stress story like Kate's, be it academic or personal -- about family or financial responsibilities, inadequate high school preparation or pressure to do well in today's increasingly competitive environment.</p>
        <p>In a 1999 survey of 683 colleges and universities conducted in the first days of school by the University of California at Los Angeles, 30.2 percent of freshmen acknowledged that they frequently felt overwhelmed, almost double the rate in 1985.</p>
        <p>The number of appointments at Cornell's counseling and psychological services has risen by 29 percent in the last four years. More than 40 percent of first-year students at Johns Hopkins University visit its counseling center.</p>
        <p>According to Dr. Samuel Parrish, medical director of the Student Health and Wellness Center at Johns Hopkins, better recordkeeping, greater awareness of on-campus services and additional staff and office hours account for some of the increase. And, he said, now ''there is no stigma in asking for help.''</p>
        <p>Mental health professionals say that young adults today appear to be under much more stress than past generations were. Many of them have fewer ''stabilizing forces in their lives,'' said Dr. David Fassler, chair of the American Psychi- atric Association's Council on Children, Adolescents and Their Families and author of ''Help Me, I'm Sad'' (Viking, 1997).</p>
        <p>''Many live far away from their extended family, or they've moved a lot of times so they're less connected to their neighborhoods,'' he said.</p>
        <p>At the extreme end of the continuum, more students may be arriving on campus with diagnosed psychological problems. After documenting a rising incidence of depression among students, Harvard University issued a report last year recommending, among other steps, that more psychologists be hired, that residence assistants and tutors receive instruction on mental problems and that two rooms be set aside in every living unit for students experiencing emotional crises.</p>
        <p>While academic pressure may not cause mental illness, it can act as a trigger. ''Some kids have a genetic predisposition for depression, and are more likely than others to get depressed,'' said Dr. Fassler, ticking off the warning signs -- ''sadness, decreased energy and appetite, loss of interest in usual activities, decreased interest in sex, any thoughts of suicide.''</p>
        <p>The vast majority of students, of course, are not clinically depressed but are experiencing the self-doubt and anxiety typically associated with the critical transition from high school and home to college, and will adjust. Ms. Wilkinson, for example, has made that transition and is now doing well.</p>
        <p>IN an attempt to minimize the trauma of freshman year, most colleges and universities supply peer counselors, residence hall advisers, faculty advisers, an academic advising center, a mental health clinic and suicide prevention services. At Cornell, students can call the Empathy, Assistance and Referral Service (EARS); at the State University of New York at Albany, the Middle Earth Peer Assistance Program sponsors a telephone line, a campus radio talk show, a weekly advice column and peer theater performances about student problems.</p>
        <p>Even the traditional organized activities of freshman year -- ice cream socials, Wilderness Reflection weekends, wrestling parties in kiddie swimming pools filled with yogurt -- have therapeutic undercurrents to help students let off steam and face the seemingly monumental task ahead.</p>
        <p>Noting that students who accept stress as normal and even beneficial tend to respond more creatively to its demands, therapists, counselors and faculty members offer a variety of advice for coping with freshman year.</p>
        <p>In ''Beating the College Blues'' (Checkmark Books, 1999), Paul A. Grayson and Philip Meilman advise students who are frequently irritable, anxious or angry, or have difficulty sleeping, to try relaxation techniques: warm baths, slow, deep breathing, meditation, guitar playing, a long walk.</p>
        <p>Dr. Grayson and Dr. Meilman, who direct counseling services at New York University and Cornell, also recommend making an inventory of commitments (say, a five-course load, 20-hour-a-week job, crew team practice at 6 a.m., a steady girlfriend); personal habits (procrastinating or partying too much?) as well as impressions of college life. That exercise helps students determine whether to drop a course or change study habits. A reality check by peers and parents can also identify flawed thinking (''I'm the only person here who has not chosen a major'').</p>
        <p>Students tend to waste time between classes, then try to read and to write papers at night, when they are tired and are tempted to socialize. It is better to complete three to four hours of course-related work, six days a week, before dinner.</p>
        <p>Students who get eight hours of sleep, get up early and study during the day, starting with the first week of classes, do not have to scramble as the assignments pile up. (This schedule has another advantage: the first person up in the morning gets immediate access to the bathroom and a hot shower.)</p>
        <p>Freshmen should get to know at least one adult on campus fairly well, starting with a faculty adviser. Alas, many students stand at the adviser's door with a hand on the knob, seeking a signature and speedy get-away, afraid to interrupt a Nobel Prize-winning experiment.</p>
        <p>More often than not, those who plant themselves in a chair ready to discuss their backgrounds, their academic and professional aspirations and uncertainties and their personal interests will get a warm response. Students who take the initiative to meet with advisers and visit professors' offices -not only after doing poorly on an exam but also to discuss a required text or ask how a professor became interested in a subject -- learn that many teach better in private than in a large lecture hall. And the college, whatever its size, begins to seem far less impersonal.</p>
        <p>In the midst of the forced social interaction that characterizes college life, it takes time and many false starts to make a real friend. Roommates do not have to be best friends, but they can be a freshman's first friend. Eating dinner with a roommate, even if she is only ''just O.K.,'' and meeting others in the dormitory and in class will help students get through those sometimes lonely first weeks.</p>
        <p>Participating in an extracurricular activity during the first semester provides contact with students who share interests. With their regular practice schedules, the marching band or rugby team may inspire discipline and efficiency.</p>
        <p>Noting that Henry David Thoreau went to the woods because he wanted to live deliberately, Prof. Allan Emery, who teaches English at Bowling Green State University in Bowling Green, Ohio, reminds his freshmen students to pause at least once a day to examine their lives.</p>
        <p>Too often, as students drive through day after busy day, waiting to vegetate, lubricate or unleash a primal scream on the weekend, college resembles anything but Walden Pond.</p>
        <p>''Seize opportunities to reflect on life -- your life and the lives of others,'' Professor Emery suggests, ''and you will be far less likely to lose your equilibrium.</p>
        <p>''That's what those well-stocked libraries, tree-lined avenues and peaceful quadrangles are for.''</p>
