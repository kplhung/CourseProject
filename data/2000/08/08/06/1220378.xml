        <p>MONTHS of speculation over Charles B. Wang's plans for the 58 properties he has purchased in Oyster Bay had made the billionaire Computer Associates executive larger than life. But he quelled the rumors and seemed to win over even the wariest of his neighbors at a meeting of more than 400 residents and local officials last week.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wang insisted that he and his partner, Sanjay Kumar, have no master plan for the hamlet and only want to do what they can to revitalize the downtown by refurbishing storefronts and bringing back the kinds of retail businesses that once thrived there.</p>
        <p>''There are no plans for ferries. There are no plans for bridges. There are no plans for the Pequot Indians to build a ferry to take anyone to casinos. There are no plans to make this into a Disneyland,'' he said, addressing just a few of the rumors that have been floated since Island Properties, a company owned by Mr. Wang and Mr. Kumar, starting buying up Oyster Bay properties about 18 months ago.</p>
        <p>''We may want to build a coliseum,'' he added. Mr. Wang, a co-owner of the New York Islanders, is looking for ways to improve or replace the Nassau Coliseum. But his impish grin gave him away. ''I'm only kidding,'' he added to a hearty round of applause.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wang said he called the meeting to formally introduce the principals of Island Properties and to reassure residents and local officials that their motives are good and that they intend to ''engage everyone in a dialogue'' to determine what would be best for the area.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wang and Mr. Kumar, who is his No. 2 at Computer Associates and a co-owner of the Islanders, are both residents of the town and are the investors in Island Properties, he said. But he stressed that Abraham Poznanski, a former Computer Associates executive, is the general manager of Island Properties. ''He speaks for us,'' Mr. Wang said, adding that while neither he nor Mr. Kumar has been very visible in any of Island Properties' transactions, Mr. Poznanski has met with local civic groups and officials more than 50 times in the last year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wang said Island Properties would issue a quarterly newsletter to keep residents apprised of their plans as they develop, and he urged residents to offer their suggestions and work with them to improve the town's quality of life.</p>
        <p>''To us, this is almost like fixing up your own house,'' Mr. Wang said. ''As private citizens, we have the resources and we think we can effect a change. We want to be a catalyst for that.''</p>
        <p>Residents seemed to like what they heard. Speaker after speaker rose to thank Mr. Wang and Mr. Kumar for their efforts. They offered ideas that included requests for a movie theater, a skating rink and a supermarket, to pleas to tear down oil tanks at the edge of town along the waterfront. One man offered to sell them a piece of property.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kumar stressed that the process would take years. ''We should agree that there will be many things we'll disagree on,'' he said. ''There'll be times when you'll be yelling at us and we'll be yelling back, but we do have in mind the best interests of the community.''</p>
        <p>Tim Archdeacon, president of the Oyster Bay Civic Association, was pleased with the meeting, even though there were few specifics offered. ''This was really needed,'' he said. ''Hopefully it will stop the reactionaries who were feeding the rumor mill and it will put a lot of the ridiculous speculation at bay.''</p>
