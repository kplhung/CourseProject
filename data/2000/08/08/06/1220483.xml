        <p>Many readers responded to Peter Applebome's July 23 Soapbox column about racial mores and suburban manners at a gas station in Westchester County. The problem the column posed was what, if anything, to say to or do about the black gentleman sharing his expletive-laden music with the world and also Mr. Applebome's 9-year-old daughter.</p>
        <p>Here is a sampling of readers' reactions.</p>
        <p>I would have simply left the gas station. I would connect the music to a very self-absorbed human being with an intellectual deficit.</p>

        <p>I am trying desperately, not to see color, but a person, and in this scenario, one who was being offensive.  Your article, calls attention to color, and in my opinion, promulgates prejudice, by asking people to judge a situation through racial glasses rather than one human being to another.</p>
