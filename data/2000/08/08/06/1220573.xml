        <p>Vladimir Putin, the new Russian president, has been a man in motion since his inauguration in May. He has curbed the power of Russia's regional governors, confronted the business moguls who control large pieces of the economy, proposed a flat tax and fired a gaggle of generals. But just where Mr. Putin is headed remains uncertain. So far much of the action seems more clearly aimed at rebuilding a strong central government than at advancing democracy and reform.</p>
        <p>Given the powerful centrifugal forces that have long tugged against Russian statehood, and the chaotic and corrupt administration of many regions in recent years, there is reason to construct an effective federal government. But as Mr. Putin draws power back to the Kremlin, the temptation to fashion a new autocracy will be great, especially for a man steeped in the ethic of the K.G.B, where he worked for many years. It was encouraging to hear him renounce a return to authoritarian rule earlier this summer, and to commit himself to the protection of political and economic freedoms. Yet nearly every step he has taken has been ambiguous on precisely that point.</p>
        <p>By curtailing the power of Russia's 89 governors, Mr. Putin may be acting to clean up years of misrule by local potentates. Many of the governors enriched themselves through illegal schemes and prevented Moscow from collecting taxes in their regions. But in other regions, the devolution of authority after the collapse of Communism gave enlightened leaders the opportunity to create democratic institutions and thriving market economies. An indiscriminate effort to rein in all governors is bound to trample the good work along with the bad.</p>
        <p>The same concern applies to Mr. Putin's dealings with Russia's tycoons. Their economic and political power should be diminished, but not by unlawful or unconstitutional means and not in a way that inhibits the media enterprises that many of them own. The government's dubious criminal case against one of the oligarchs, Vladimir Gusinsky, was wisely dropped after Mr. Putin made known his unhappiness with the crude attack. But an economic vise is now being tightened around Mr. Gusinsky's company, Media-Most, probably with the assent of the Kremlin. The goal seems to be to wrest control of Russia's main independent television station from Mr. Gusinsky.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin's economic program embraces free-market principles, and calls for a long overdue simplification of the tax system. But Mr. Putin seems to think that the government can re-engineer the economy from the top down, another example of his tendency to centralize power in the Kremlin.</p>
        <p>For now, Mr. Putin's authority is partly checked. He had to settle for less control than he wanted with both the governors and the businessmen. His dismissal last week of six generals allied with Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev suggested he could not fire Mr. Sergeyev himself in a dispute over military policy. But as he learns to wield the nearly dictatorial powers that the Yeltsin-era Constitution gives him, Mr. Putin will have to decide whether he intends to build a durable democracy or just rebuild the machinery of state.</p>
