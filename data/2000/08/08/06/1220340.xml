        <p>As Fiji struggles to establish a new government, cruise lines remain concerned about the safety of some of the country's ports. Fiji has been in turmoil since mid-May, when indigenous rebels, objecting to leadership by people of Indian descent, seized government officials and held them hostage until July 13.</p>
        <p>Crystal Cruises has decided to scratch a scheduled Sept. 6 stop at Suva, the capital of Fiji, during a 20-night voyage aboard the Crystal Harmony that leaves San Francisco for Sydney on Aug. 22. The ship will be at sea on the 6th and substitute a call at the Isle of Pines in New Caledonia on Sept. 7.</p>

The ship will be at sea on the 6th and substitute a call at the Isle of Pines in New Caledonia on Sept. 7.</p>
        <p>The Seabourn Sun of Seabourn Cruise Line, originally scheduled to call at Suva on Oct. 13 during a 14-night cruise out of Sydney that begins Oct. 3, will also bypass Fiji for now. The line will call at Port Vila in Vanuatu instead. The Seabourn Sun, however, is still scheduled to call at Lautoka, Fiji, on the west coast of the main island, during a 13-night cruise from Sydney beginning Oct. 17.</p>
        <p>Peter Deilmann Cruises still intends to have its ship the Deutschland call at Suva for 24 hours on Sept. 4 during an 18-night voyage from Papeete, Tahiti, to Sydney that begins Aug. 25.</p>
