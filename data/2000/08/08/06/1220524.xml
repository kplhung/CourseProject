        <p>The Williamsburg Savings Bank, Brooklyn's tallest building, may soon have a neighbor sharing its skyline.</p>
        <p>As the development firm Forest City Ratner negotiates with the Metropolitan Transit Authority to build a retail complex over the nearby Long Island Rail Road station, the plans may make provisions for an office tower of unspecified height above the complex, said Tom Kelly, an authority spokesman.</p>
        <p>The 435,000-square-foot complex, whose anchor tenant will be a Target store, will be about four stories high, but its design may include pillars that could support a larger building above the retail complex.</p>
        <p>Joyce Baumgarten, a spokeswoman for Forest City, said the city approved the site for an office tower in the early 1980's but it was never built. She said the company has not yet decided whether to build a tower but acknowledged that ''they are designing the retail center so that an office tower could be developed there.''</p>
        <p>Kenneth Diamondstone, treasurer of the Atlantic Avenue Local Development Corporation, said Community Board 2 had approved a tower in the 1980's, when Baruch College was considering building on the site; he added that he had not heard about the options for a tower on the Forest City site.</p>
        <p>Irene Van Slyke, vice president of the Atlantic Avenue Betterment Association, said she was concerned that the developer might not take neighbors' concerns into account. ''My personal experience has been that Ratner does not negotiate with the community,'' she said, adding that the nearby Atlantic Center Mall, built by Forest City in the 1980's, is fortresslike and unpopular among some residents.</p>
        <p>While the project may require an updated environmental impact report, community board approval is not required. Ms. Baumgarten said Forest City would keep the board informed of its plans.</p>
