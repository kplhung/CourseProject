        <p>To the Editor: The timeliness of Lisa Fugard's ''Rare Flowers and Ruined Choirs'' (July 9) can only be explained by the influence of mystical Ireland. For on July 10, the High Court of Ireland ended a saga begun in 1991, when it ordered the Office of Public Works to restore to its former condition the area at the Burren where the agency had started construction on an interpretive center, parking and tourist facilities within the Burren itself.</p>

        <p>To the Editor: The timeliness of Lisa Fugard's ''Rare Flowers and Ruined Choirs'' (July 9) can only be explained by the influence of mystical Ireland. For on July 10, the High Court of Ireland ended a saga begun in 1991, when it ordered the Office of Public Works to restore to its former condition the area at the Burren where the agency had started construction on an interpretive center, parking and tourist facilities within the Burren itself.</p>
        <p>The High Court ruling came after a number of court cases brought by a determined group of farmers, academics, environmentalists, other professionals and just plain folk who banded together as the Burren Action Group to fight what they saw as a desecration of this unique landscape. In spite of major support in its fundraising, the BAG, as it is known here, remains $225,000 in debt for legal costs.</p>
