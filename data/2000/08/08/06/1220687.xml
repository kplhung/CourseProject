        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>Marc Bloom pays appropriate homage to Floyd Heard's great run in the 200 meters at the recent United States Olympic track and field trials (''Viewers Are Losers When TV Sets Track's Agenda'' July 30). However, Bloom misses the mark in stating that NBC ''set the schedule'' or the agenda for what turned out to be the much ballyhooed Michael Johnson versus Maurice Greene matchup, stating that USA Track and Field merely ''went along'' with an NBC edict.</p>

        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>Marc Bloom pays appropriate homage to Floyd Heard's great run in the 200 meters at the recent United States Olympic track and field trials (''Viewers Are Losers When TV Sets Track's Agenda'' July 30). However, Bloom misses the mark in stating that NBC ''set the schedule'' or the agenda for what turned out to be the much ballyhooed Michael Johnson versus Maurice Greene matchup, stating that USA Track and Field merely ''went along'' with an NBC edict.</p>
        <p>The scheduling of the Olympic trials involved complicated consideration of the number of day and night sessions available to us; usage patterns of the field-event areas and track; desire of long-distance runners to compete in the cool of the night and sprinters to compete in the heat of the day; accommodation of athletes who might want to run multiple events; and an interest in roughly approximating the Sydney Olympic schedule (such as having the semifinals and final of the 200-meter races within a two-hour time frame).</p>
        <p>Only once those basics were in place was the schedule's ''entertainment value'' for the live and television audience taken into account. The 1992 and the 1996 Olympic trials both ended with the men's 200-meter race, and NBC's only role in scheduling the 200 this year was to request that we move our proposed start from 5:50 p.m. to 5:48 p.m. to allow time for a post-race interview.</p>

        <p>The writer is the chief operating officer of USA Track and Field.</p>
