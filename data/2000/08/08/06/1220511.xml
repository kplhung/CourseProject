        <p>SOMETIMES prophets who cry out in the wilderness are heard. Even heeded. In the realm of urban preservation, Nathan Silver is among that rare and happy breed.</p>
        <p>In 1967, as a 27-year-old assistant professor of architecture at Columbia University, he researched and wrote a book, ''Lost New York.'' Among other things, it denounced the recent demolition of Pennsylvania Station with its ''ingenious magniloquence.'' (Mr. Silver's writing style might be described as Conjunctive Baroque.) And it exhaustively recorded the loss of many distinctive buildings, from the Rococo auditorium of the old Metropolitan Opera House at Broadway and 39th Street to the low vaulted spaces of the gilt-edged Canfield's Gambling House on East 44th Street, which proved ''infinitely attractive to society's layabouts'' in the early 20th century.</p>
        <p>Thumbing through the book's archival photos was like viewing a black-and-white kinescope of an architectural dream city that, many readers realized with a shock, had really existed. To Mr. Nathan, the steady demise of that phantom New York was symptomatic of the city's pursuit of ''change in a heedless and suicidal fashion.''</p>
        <p>Attention was paid, particularly by the city's nascent preservation groups, for whom ''Lost New York'' became an essential document. The author estimates that over the years the book has sold 100,000 copies.</p>
        <p>This week, Houghton Mifflin is publishing a revised edition. Mr. Nathan said he had added 108 photos, most of them in a new section titled ''Places and Monuments.'' They include such scenes from ''the metropolitan space-time continuum'' as a police re-creation of the 1906 Stanford White killing at the Madison Square roof garden on Madison Avenue and 26th Street, the upper-class frippery of the 1911 Easter parade on mansion-lined Fifth Avenue, and the 1952 nightclub set at Ladies Night at the Savoy Ballroom on Lenox Avenue in Harlem.</p>
        <p>The book also updates the fate of several places that the first edition had listed as endangered. Among the saved are the former Friends Meeting House on East 20th Street, the cast-iron buildings on Broome and Grand Streets, the Custom House at Bowling Green, and Sailors' Snug Harbor on Staten Island.</p>
        <p>Mr. Silver moved to London 32 years ago to teach, and he has remained there. Asked recently to predict which buildings might be preserved today and kept out of future editions of his book, he replied: ''I wouldn't, at the 3,000-mile distance that I am now, try to tell New Yorkers about which buildings should be saved or lost. More and more, my interest is in memory.''</p>
        <p>Here are Mr. Silver's observations, taken from the new edition of his book, on three notable buildings that have been lost.</p>
        <p>JIM O'GRADY</p>
        <p>The Singer Tower, Lower Broadway</p>
        <p>Ernest Flagg's impressive design of the little Singer building on Broadway at Prince Street, which survives, led to his commission for the 47-story Singer Tower at 149 Broadway and Liberty Street. It was the tallest building in the world from 1908 until the completion of the Metropolitan Life Tower 18 months later. The tower's projecting attic floors, mansarded roof and lantern long remained a characteristic figure in the New York skyscape. The shaft rose above the lower section -- a building stage that had been completed earlier -- with an unprecedented slenderness, braced by crossed diagonals in the corners, a kind of support against wind pressure now commonly used in steel buildings. The demonstration of a tall tower limited to a quarter of the site area influenced New York's 1916 zoning ordinance.</p>
        <p>The form of Flagg's tower top, and the materials of his extroverted lobby of colored marble, bronze and glass saucer-domes, reflected some of the stylistic preoccupations of his training at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. But the main exogenous inspiration seems to have been the client's product: that ornamental, practical, technologically advanced turn-of-the-century Singer sewing machine, whose logo even appeared on the lobby capitals. The building was demolished in 1966 to clear the site for a bulkier and higher one, and achieved another first: the first widely recognized former ''tallest'' building to bite the dust.</p>
        <p>The Laing Stores, Washington and Murray Streets</p>
        <p>In 1849 James Bogardus finished this four-story row of storehouses for Edgar H. Laing, some time before his own Eccentric Mill Works was completed. The Laing Stores -- erected in two months -- was not a complete iron structure such as those Bogardus and Daniel Badger separately fabricated later. It was valuable because it had a historically early iron-clad exterior and was the only complete building by Bogardus that survived in New York.</p>
        <p>As the first edition of ''Lost New York'' noted, the building was ''slated for demolition, but with the cooperation of other city departments, the Landmarks Preservation Commission has succeeded in saving most of the iron facades. They will be taken down and preserved for re-erection on a future site.'' What actually happened was that the commission stored the 150 tons of cast-iron elements in a vacant lot in lower Manhattan, where thieves were caught stealing the last pieces in June 1974. The rest had been sold for scrap. The 59 panels recovered were moved to an empty building uptown, but in June 1977 it was discovered that these, too, had been stolen. Mocked by all, the chairman of the Landmarks Commission wrote to The New York Times blaming everyone else for not taking historical renovation seriously because public indignation was greater about the thefts than the demolition. Sadly, the commission's neglect was what proved terminal.</p>
        <p>82 Beekman Street</p>
        <p>A 1967 photo from the Danny Lyon series ''The Destruction of Lower Manhattan'' records the demolition of 82 Beekman Street -- a humanistic and innovative cast-iron-clad building sacrificed, with others, for a traffic scheme. The wanton destruction was justified as ''slum clearance.'' James Bogardus built 82 Beekman Street in 1853 for Tatham &amp; Brothers.</p>
