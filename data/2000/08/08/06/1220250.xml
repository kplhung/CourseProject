        <p>Hunting With Hemingway</p>
        <p>Based on the Stories</p>
        <p>of Leicester Hemingway.</p>

        <p>For so brief a memoir, ''Hunting With Hemingway'' lacks focus. Primarily it is about listening to an audiotape discovered by Hilary Hemingway, a niece of Ernest Hemingway and the daughter of Ernest's brother, Leicester, on which Leicester tells tall tales around a campfire in Florida in the 1970's about hunting with Ernest years earlier. The memoir presents not only the tales but also the chitchat of two audiences: Hilary, her husband, Jeffry Lindsay, and their daughter as they listen to the tape, and Leicester's campfire companions, among them an English professor on a hunt of his own for Hemingway fodder. This excess of remarkers remarking is cloyingly artificial. Leicester tells a good story, though, of battling cobras, tigers, bears, ostriches, baboons and crocodiles throughout Africa, as well as sea snakes and Nazis in the Caribbean. Inevitably, Ernest's Batman comes to the rescue of Leicester's Robin just as the poor boy is about to be stomped, poisoned or eaten. For Hilary, the book is also a personal journey as she ponders her father's suicide (''the family exit'' as the Hemingways call it) in 1982 when she was in college. Although she admits the stories may be fiction, she makes a minimal effort to verify them and then does something totally unforgivable: she tosses the tape into the ocean! Could it be that this whole thing -- tales, tape and search for truth -- is a sham, proving once again that, as Hilary notes, ''It's a Hemingway trait to embellish''?</p>
