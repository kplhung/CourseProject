        <p>AS the helicopter whined to life and we lifted up and away on a cloudless morning last month, the low winter sun threw long, sharp shadows across Sydney's terrain. We were flying toward a land known for 20,000 years as the place between two worlds.</p>

        <p>AS the helicopter whined to life and we lifted up and away on a cloudless morning last month, the low winter sun threw long, sharp shadows across Sydney's terrain. We were flying toward a land known for 20,000 years as the place between two worlds.</p>
        <p>It is an area of wetlands, grassy fields and eucalyptus forest about a half hour's train ride from downtown. Aborigines know it as the place between sea and mountains, the place that divided the coastal people from the forest people. After the English arrived  in 1788, it became the pathway to the Blue Mountains and the vast, harsh land beyond. A settler named it Homebush; the country was the bush and this was his home. Over time it became the site of a salt mine, a slaughterhouse, a prison, an ammunition depot and the municipal dump.</p>
        <p>In a few more weeks, after an ingenious makeover, Homebush Bay, as it is now called, will become the main site for the Games of the XXVII Olympiad. It is the pride of Sydney and the most dramatic proof of the new city that has blossomed in the bright light of Olympic preparation. About 70 percent of the action will be held in Homebush Bay, in strikingly sleek steel-and-glass structures that seem to float and soar at the same time, including Stadium Australia, with its 110,000-seat capacity one of the largest facilities in Olympic history.  Most of the 15,000 athletes, coaches and officials will live a long javelin's throw away in solar-powered town houses and apartments on streets named after Olympic heroes like Michael Jordan and Muhammad Ali.</p>
        <p>Many of the 300,000 spectators expected each day from Sept. 15 to Oct. 1 will arrive by train, entering the site from a new station that features a rippling series of vaulted roofs conveying a crowd surging forward. They will walk across giant stone plazas and along tree-lined promenades connecting the separate sports arenas. They will be surrounded by hundreds of acres of parks, which include a man-made mountain the same height as Kronos Hill, which overlooked ancient Olympia in Greece.</p>
        <p>When we last visited Sydney in 1993, just a few days after it was awarded the Games, it was a pleasant and pretty place, but it felt parochial. Today, befitting a metropolis of four million, it feels like a major international city. The streets are thick with new skyscrapers. Hundreds of expensive shops, restaurants and clubs have opened in familiar tourist neighborhoods like the Rocks and Darling Harbour and in areas like Woolloomooloo (The Loo, for short), a former haven for waterfront rogues.</p>
        <p>To us, the people seemed different, too, this time -- more worldly, more together  and more in a hurry. Walk quickly or you will get stranded in the middle of intersections when the lights change. Everyone seems to have a mobile phone; along George Street, the city's Fifth Avenue, many Sydneysiders are draped in Prada, Versace or Armani. With 140 nationalities among them, they also come in as many colors as New Yorkers and speak as many languages -- Chinese is the second most-spoken.</p>
        <p>Their crime rate is low, their tolerance  high. Gambling is now legal and so is prostitution. You can throw your money away in the very Las Vegas-like Star City Casino in Darling Harbour or in smaller gaming rooms in bars and restaurants around town.  In Kings Cross, strip joints adjoin Internet cafes; despite a few nodding down-and-out, this mildly garish area is so harmless that we took our 3-year-old son Jake there for a stroll one evening.</p>
        <p>Gambling and prostitution are just two of Sydney's diversions. Most Sydneysiders prefer its dance clubs and lively pubs, which are often called hotels. We watched hip crowds mill in and out of the Brooklyn Hotel -- yes, Brooklyn -- on George Street. A big gay scene unfolds nightly in Darlinghurst, south of Kings Cross. Sydney has one of the world's largest gay populations, and is set to play host to the 2002 Gay Games.</p>
        <p>Tolerance is the natural byproduct of Sydney's easygoing nature. The people of Sydney are upbeat and friendly. ''No worries, mate,'' they all seem to say, after you beg their pardon, inquire of the time, thank them for a service.</p>
        <p>The Sydney boom began when the city was awarded the Games in September 1993. But it was not just the Olympics that propelled Sydney forward. Australia escaped most of the Asian financial crisis. Like the United States, it has enjoyed nearly a decade of economic growth. The public and private sectors poured money into the infrastructure, not just in anticipation of the Games but also millennium events and a major celebration next year marking the centenary of the Australian federation.</p>
        <p>''This has been the biggest transformation the city has ever experienced,'' says Lucy Hughes Turnbull, the stylish deputy lord mayor of Sydney and the author of a book on the city's history.</p>
        <p>Developers spent over $4.7 billion on new skyscrapers and hotels. The city spent $190 million more to repave streets, widen sidewalks and add parks. Private companies and institutions also spruced up. Even gothic St. Mary's Cathedral, used but unfinished for more than a century, finally got its twin spires. When they are finished, Sydney's Olympic organizers and their partners in the state of New South Wales will have spent $2.5 billion to build and run the Olympic sites, most of which have long been completed and field-tested in local and national competitions.</p>
        <p>Stadium Australia, a marvel held together by two steel trusses the length of football fields, and the Sydney SuperDome next door, a 20,000-seat arena for basketball and gymnastics, are linked by the site's main plaza and a soldierly line of 19 solar-powered lighting towers, one for each of the cities that have been host to the modern Olympic Summer Games.</p>
        <p>The Aquatic Center and the Hockey Center are on the other side of the stadium, along Olympic Boulevard. Across the Boulevard is the Baseball Stadium; at the south end is the Tennis Center. Practice facilities, support buildings and two hotels rise near the main venues, which are arrayed around the vaulted railway station. The athletes' village sits on a bluff overlooking the venues and parkland. The entire setting somehow seems intimate and spacious; the planners' guiding idea was to leave behind another place between worlds, a place for public relaxation between the worlds of work and home.</p>
        <p>For those who want to visit, more than a million of seven million tickets to various events, including basketball, soccer and synchronized swimming, were still available in late July -- as were some very pricey closing-ceremony tickets ($800 and $575). With some previously reserved hotel rooms being released by Olympic officials, it may still be possible to find city accommodations; tourism officials recommend visiting their site, www.visitnsw.com.au. Visitors are not likely to find rooms in any of the recently built or refurbished deluxe hotels, but one, the Westin Sydney on the site of the General Post Office on Martin Place, is worth a look anyway. An atrium connects it with the old Macquarie Bank building and creates an airy lobby that includes murals, sleek sculptures and escalators leading to a waterfall.</p>
        <p>AFTER buzzing the main Olympic site, our helicopter flight took us directly over the Sydney Harbour Bridge, locally known as the coat hanger. You can take a train across it; you can walk it; you can even climb the arch. To the right is newly buffed up Darling Harbour, which will be host to some Olympic events and offers some of Sydney's best views. In addition to the new casino, it has new restaurants, promenades, exhibition halls and attractions, including a giant IMAX theater, playgrounds and arcades for children.</p>
        <p>A couple days earlier, a musician at the harbor's Northern Territory and Outback Centre had given our son a lesson on playing the didgeridoo, an Aboriginal musical instrument made from small logs found in the bush that have been hollowed out by termites. The center was an Aboriginal arts and cultural exhibition when we visited seven years ago, but  attendance fell off, a clerk told us, and the owners had to try something new.</p>
        <p>Until recently, the Aborigines, who make up about 2 percent of the country's 19 million people, remained in the background of modern Australian life. Most still live in the bush and suffer high rates of unemployment, poverty and illiteracy. But an Aboriginal rights movement has gained strength as the Olympics draw near.  One catalyst was a 1997 government report describing how, during much of this century, about 50,000 children of full or mixed Aboriginal blood were forcibly taken from their parents and placed with white families or institutions in a government-directed effort to assimilate them into white culture.</p>
        <p>Many white Australian leaders have issued apologies to the Aborigines for the so-called ''stolen generations,'' but not Prime Minister John Howard, who says he can only regret -- but not apologize for -- previous governments' mistakes.</p>
        <p>Some predict major protests during the Olympics, but few seem to want or expect violence.</p>
        <p>''I think the prime minister should apologize,'' said the prominent Australian artist John Moriarty, who was taken from his Aboriginal mother when he was 4 years old. ''But I don't see any reason to give the world negative demonstrations. I would leave it to Aboriginal athletes to make the boldest statements, by winning medals.'' The Aboriginal athlete most likely to do so is Cathy Freeman, a sprinter who won a silver medal in Atlanta in 1996 and is a gold-medal favorite in Sydney. During our visit, she made headlines by accusing the government of insensitivity toward indigenous people.</p>
        <p>Spectators who come to see Freeman go for gold and other Olympics visitors will find buses and trains  their best bets: Private cars will be banned in the city center and Homebush Bay. Many buses and trains will serve the sporting sites (Olympic ticketholders travel free), and you can get around the city by ferry, taxi, bus, commuter train and monorail.</p>
        <p>Our son, who has developed a healthy obsession for public transport while living in Manhattan and Hong Kong, loved Sydney, and so did we, again. It is not as muscular as those cities, but it shares some of the same vibrations while being much easier to navigate.</p>
        <p>As a tantrum-prone toddler, Jake did not allow us to dine in finer establishments. But we made do with the Star City casino buffet in Darling Harbour and in the city center at the charming Ark Sushi King Train on Pitt Street, where you sit at a counter and take your food from dozens of choices available from a conveyor belt passing endlessly before you. We also tried many sidewalk cafes; at Bondi Beach, Australia's most famous patch of sand, we got a tasty platter of fried calamari, shrimps and whitefish -- and the chance to ogle tattooed, long-haired cross-dressers, among other individualists -- for only $5.</p>
        <p>Bondi Beach is also the setting of an Olympic site that is still being built; the planners wanted to wait as long as possible before placing a temporary beach-volleyball stadium  on its famous sand, which has many zealous guardians. Those guardians were upset about the stadium until late July, when it was revealed that it had caused a bowl effect to develop in the sand beneath the surf, which yielded bigger waves for Bondi's year-round surfer dudes. So now, even the famously laid-back beach bums of Bondi are said to have Olympic fever.</p>
