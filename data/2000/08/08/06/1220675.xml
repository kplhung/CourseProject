        <p>There are always stories about Daniel Snyder, the Washington Redskins' owner. Some are true. Some are tall tales. They swirl around him as if he were living an Aesop fable. The moral of the stories is, well, mixed. He is a savior, a braggart, a genius and the big bad wolf all wrapped up in one.</p>
        <p>And he wants to win. Snyder, who took control of the Redskins in the spring of 1999, is a poor loser, and because of that he might be the best thing to happen to professional football in years.</p>
        <p>No owner since Oakland's Al Davis or Dallas's Jerry Jones has shaken up professional football like the 35-year-old Snyder, who plans to outwork and outspend his competitors. This off-season he undertook the most aggressive free-agent spree ever, paying $40 million in signing bonuses to assemble what amounts to an all-star team. Because of free-agent pickups like Deion Sanders and Bruce Smith, both future Hall of Famers, many in the league believe the Redskins are the Super Bowl favorites.</p>
        <p>The rest of the National Football League has taken notice, not only of Snyder's fat wallet, but also of his brashness, and some say, his outright arrogance. Snyder may not be a renegade like Davis, who sued his own league, and Jones, who sought to dismantle the N.F.L.'s revenue-sharing system, but his aggressiveness is causing the same kind of allergic reaction among his fellow owners. He particularly irked some owners by being the first to charge fans admission to training camp practices.</p>
        <p>''A lot of it is true,'' Snyder said, ''I'm aggressive, I'm entrepreneurial, I want to win. I want to win fast and now. All of this is true, absolutely.</p>
        <p>''But I've run a lot of businesses and I've been very rational,'' he said. ''And I've been in a lot of competitive environments and this is just another competitive environment where if you want to win you really need to be aggressive. If you're not, you won't win.''</p>
        <p>Wellington Mara, the Giants' co-owner, who is in the Hall of Fame, has said in the past that he is no fan of Jones, and during a recent interview Mara made it clear he was not a member of the Snyder fan club, either.</p>
        <p>When asked if he had met Snyder, a rival owner in the National Football Conference East, Mara responded: ''Yes, we've met. I wouldn't use the word charming with him, but he's been fine.</p>
        <p>''I don't agree with a lot of what he has done, and I don't want to get specific about what I don't like,'' said Mara, the first owner to publicly criticize Snyder.</p>
        <p>''He is entitled to do what he wants, because he paid $800 million for the team. A lot of us old fogeys wish we had made as much money as he has at that age. But I wonder if he is the type of person who will only look out for himself, instead of the well-being of the entire league.''</p>
        <p>When asked if he thought Snyder was a younger version of Jones, Mara joked, ''Please don't say that.'' Then with a serious tone, Mara said: ''Let's hope he doesn't become an older Jerry Jones. That would be unfortunate. But I think he's headed in that direction.''</p>
        <p>Mara's comments were typical of those from other team owners, many of whom spoke only on condition of anonymity, and illustrate Snyder's plight. While trying to make the Redskins winners again, he must be aggressive, but in doing so, he is angering many of the people with whom he must coexist, partly because he goes against some N.F.L. traditions, partly because he has rubbed some the wrong way with his cockiness. Only Davis and Jones are referred to with the same kind of venom by the N.F.L.'s elite.</p>
        <p>Snyder represents a new breed of N.F.L. owner. As millionaires get younger, and more begin to buy their way into professional football, they will move with the kind of urgency that made them so rich so quickly. Snyder earned his first million by the time he was 20, and by 31, he was the youngest chief executive of a company on the New York Stock Exchange. He is president of Snyder Communications, a direct-marketing firm, and before there is a speck of gray in his hair, he may have a Super Bowl ring.</p>
        <p>The Redskins were once a model team in the glory days of Joe Gibbs, but they have made it to the playoffs only twice since their last Super Bowl appearance in 1992. Wanting the Redskins to shed their veil of mediocrity, Snyder has turned the team upside down, moving with all the tenderness of a thunderstorm. He has fired some two dozen employees, including General Manager Charley Casserly. The team's contract negotiator, Joe Mendes, quit late last month, citing the need to take a break. From what, he did not say, but to work for Snyder, or to compete against him, requires skin as thick as concrete.</p>
        <p>Direct Managing Style</p>
        <p>Which leads to the stories, told throughout the league, by owners, coaches, general managers and former and current Redskins officials.</p>
        <p>Like the one about Snyder yelling himself hoarse in dressing down Coach Norv Turner in the trainer's room immediately after a loss at Dallas last October. Turner came out of the meeting ashen-faced. Snyder, who said that jobs were on the line, added, ''I'm going to get my voice fixed, and then I'm going to use it.''</p>
        <p>During one practice, Snyder is said to have called one of the team's personnel men a ''dumb idiot'' in front of other members of the organization after the man made a derogatory remark about a player Snyder liked. Snyder denied the story.</p>
        <p>And this off-season Washington was interested in Seattle wide receiver Joey Galloway, but the Seahawks froze out the Redskins and traded Galloway to N.F.C. East rival Dallas. Incensed, Snyder, with only one year of league experience, called Mike Holmgren, the Seattle coach and general manager and a 20-year N.F.L. veteran, the story goes, and chewed him out.</p>
        <p>Truth or fiction? Holmgren refused to give details of his conversation with Snyder. Snyder said only that the two men ''kidded each other pretty good.''</p>
        <p>During one of his first league meetings, Snyder met the Detroit Lions' vice chairman, William Clay Ford Jr., son of the team's owner, and made an obnoxious remark about Ford's family business, the automobile industry.</p>
        <p>Ford said through a spokesman that he could not recall the story. An owner who spoke on condition of anonymity said that he was standing next to Ford and heard the conversation and that Snyder did indeed say something that irritated Ford. Snyder called the story ''total garbage.''</p>
        <p>''Everything I have done,'' Snyder said, ''has been twisted into great pretzels. I don't go into the locker room before games ever. I don't stand on the sideline like Jerry Jones. I don't watch film with the coaching staff.''</p>
        <p>The stories overshadow Snyder's contributions to his team. He has unified a formerly divided front office and coaching staff. He hired the talented Vinny Cerrato to replace Casserly.</p>
        <p>Snyder also increased the number of blacks in the organization. He fixed a disgraceful parking problem that caused fans to wait hours to get in and out of the stadium he owns, FedEx Stadium, and he replaced substandard practice fields.</p>
        <p>Over all, because of his sweat and more than $15 million out of his pocket to finance the needed stadium changes, he has made watching a Redskins game more enjoyable for fans, and the organization more of a home for coaches and players.</p>
        <p>''Most of all he has made everyone accountable,'' said Bruce Smith, the Redskins defensive end, ''from the top to the bottom. As a player you have to respect that.''</p>
        <p>Snyder, his supporters say, has other positive attributes. Because he grew up in a multicultural setting in suburban Maryland, they say, he has an easier time relating to black team and league officials, who often complain that some owners speak condescendingly to them. One black league official said Snyder was the first owner to ask him out for a beer.</p>
        <p>Snyder is invaluable in another way -- he has what players call juice. Today's N.F.L. has no dynasties. And fascinating characters like Mike Ditka, Lawrence Taylor and Refrigerator Perry are gone. Stars such as John Elway, Dan Marino and Steve Young have retired. Now some of the greatest football debates are about the salary cap.</p>
        <p>Snyder is giving the league personality, several owners conceded, and a much-needed kick in the shin, by forcing everyone else to work harder and to be more creative to keep up. ''Competition never hurt anybody,'' Mara said. ''The moves he is making, yes, they hurt the league in a sense, but on the other hand, it is good to shake things up every once in a while. The worst thing is being comfortable, and he is disturbing our comfort.''</p>
        <p>Washington Winning Again</p>
        <p>Snyder deserves credit for quickly building what looks to be a championship-caliber team. In 1998, the season before Snyder took over, the Redskins were 6-10. Last year they were 10-6 and won the N.F.C. East before losing in the second round of the playoffs.</p>
        <p>Then in April, Washington drafted Penn State linebacker LaVar Arrington ($34 million contract) and Alabama offensive tackle Chris Samuels ($30 million); both are having excellent training camps and will be starters. Snyder signed veterans Mark Carrier (five years, $15 million), Jeff George (four years, $18 million), Smith (four years, $23 million) and Sanders (seven years, $56 million).</p>
        <p>Snyder and his staff quickly assembled not just talent, but also depth. Nothing quite like it has been done before. It is true that eventually the signings may seriously affect the team's salary cap, just as the San Francisco 49ers' maneuverings in the 1990's have hurt them now. One owner who has analyzed Washington's cap contends that after next season, the Redskins will have to do major salary restructuring and dump players to stay within the cap, now $62.2 million. Snyder denied this.</p>
        <p>But Snyder is not afraid to take chances. There are teams that are perennially stuck near the bottom of the standing but rarely make aggressive moves to break out of the funk.</p>
        <p>Yet Snyder can taint his positive efforts by going too far, the same way Davis and Jones have before him. For example, Snyder, in an attempt to market the Redskins brand beyond Washington, began advertising in Baltimore, violating a gentleman's agreement not to advertise in each other's market. David Modell, the Baltimore Ravens' president, said the Ravens might retaliate with airplane ads over the Redskins' training camp in Ashburn.</p>
        <p>No one should think Snyder is without supporters, however. He said he had a good relationship with Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, and just last week the Carolina owner, Jerry Richardson, visited the Redskins' complex, observing the changes Snyder has made.</p>
        <p>So don't be surprised if several years from now, many teams are charging fans to watch training camp practices. It is, after all, a copycat league. ''Did you see that trophy case out there?'' Snyder asked. ''My goal is to add as many trophies as I can. I plan on being here a long time.''</p>
