        <p>Elizabeth Doyle has always had a passion for precious rocks. She majored in geology at Amherst and studied at the Gemological Institute of America. In May, with a sister, she opened a store on 189 Orchard Street, near Houston Street on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, specializing in estate and antique jewels. ''It's not what I envisioned,'' Ms. Doyle said, ''but it's exactly what I want.''</p>

        <p>Elizabeth Doyle has always had a passion for precious rocks. She majored in geology at Amherst and studied at the Gemological Institute of America. In May, with a sister, she opened a store on 189 Orchard Street, near Houston Street on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, specializing in estate and antique jewels. ''It's not what I envisioned,'' Ms. Doyle said, ''but it's exactly what I want.''</p>
        <p>Framed cases display jewelry from 5 years old to over 200. Pieces include the eccentric, like a $450 ring from the 1940's that interweaves gold and elephant hair,  and the costly, like a $15,000 emerald and diamond Art Deco bar pin.</p>
        <p>Jewelry, Ms. Doyle said, is ''so beautiful and interesting, especially when it has a lot of history.'' One such piece is an oval mourning pendant, $500, worn after a loved one's death in the late 19th century. One side is blue enamel with a pearl cross; on the other is a window containing a rose petal.</p>
