        <p>The Manhattan location, at 102 North End Avenue, caters to the business people of the financial district, and to residents who have had few options in nearby movie theaters. It has 16 screens and stadium-style seating.</p>

        <p>Regal Cinemas, with more than 400 theaters in 32 states, has moved into New York, opening two theaters last month in Battery Park City in Manhattan and in  Brooklyn Heights.</p>
        <p>The Manhattan location, at 102 North End Avenue, caters to the business people of the financial district, and to residents who have had few options in nearby movie theaters. It has 16 screens and stadium-style seating.</p>
        <p>The Brooklyn Heights theater is at 108 Court Street, near Atlantic Avenue, and with 12 screens is the largest theater in the neighborhood. To fit into the neighborhood's small scale, the theater's signs are smaller than most of the chain's.</p>
