        <p>With Internet funds hemorrhaging cash and wireless funds careening after an earnings warning from Nokia, America needs a cool new mutual fund sector. How about water? It's eternal. It's cool. And this most basic of life's necessities even has its own mutual fund.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the initial returns of the $4.5 million Water Fund have been slightly soggy. Since its introduction last Oct. 28, the fund has gained just over 2 percent, compared with the 8.2 percent return of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index.</p>
        <p>The fund is managed by the Avalon Trust Company, a Santa Fe, N.M., investment concern that specializes in socially conscious investing. Despite the slow start, Owen M. Quattlebaum, the fund's manager, predicts that opportunities for water investments will not dry up anytime soon.</p>
        <p>''It has elements of a scarce commodity,'' he said. ''More people appear to be looking to use it in areas where the supply is not growing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Quattlebaum said the bulk of his portfolio was devoted to playing mergers and acquisitions in domestic water utilities and to buying companies developing water filtration technologies.</p>
