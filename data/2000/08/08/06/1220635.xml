        <p>Reporter finds that a private dinner with Vice Pres Al Gore that Gore is the good company that his friends say he is, laughing over some of his favorite stupid country music lyrics, making fund of himself for pandering to Roman Catholics, and even gossiping a little (S)5</p>

        <p>Al Gore's Hank Williams imitation is certainly surprising, and he did it at dinner, by request -- with his mouth full of food, actually.

        <p>Al Gore's Hank Williams imitation is certainly surprising, and he did it at dinner, by request -- with his mouth full of food, actually. ''Have you ever seen a robin cry,'' he twanged, ''when leaves begin to fall.'' Then, on a roll, he sang a few lines of Garth Brooks's ''I've Got Friends in Low Places.''</p>
        <p>Though there is no sense in which a recent on-the-record dinner with a reporter can be considered an occasion to glimpse the ''private'' Al Gore, he was the good company his friends swear that he is, laughing over some of his favorite stupid country lyrics, making fun of himself for pandering to Roman Catholics, even gossiping a little.</p>
        <p>And the fact that the dinner took place at all, unsupervised by aides, in Mr. Gore's hotel suite on the road in New York several weeks ago, says that he is not always as cautious as he is generally considered.</p>
        <p>He began by saying grace over the herb chicken and roasted vegetables and remarked that he had always been puzzled by the idea that a person cannot believe fervently in both God and science. ''I never saw the slightest inconsistency,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Speaking unselfconsciously of his own faith, he said, ''The separation of church and state is a very healthy principle I would die for, but this insistence on separating belief from our daily life is at the root of many of our problems.''</p>
        <p>He expressed interest in Garry Wills's new book, ''Papal Sin: Structure of Deceit,'' and because it is critical of the Catholic Church, said, laughing, ''I guess I won't be able to praise his work any more with any degree of political safety.''</p>
        <p>And he mocked himself, too, in describing his stubborn efforts to proselytize the astronomer Carl Sagan, saying: ''My great challenge was to convert Carl Sagan. I moved him from atheist to agnostic. But I think he was just playing word games with me.''</p>
