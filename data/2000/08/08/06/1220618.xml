        <p>Orlando Patterson Op-ed article on some observers contending that Republicans' posturing on inclusiveness is a mere charade; argues, however, that Gov George W Bush is likely to benefit from rainbow parade for a simple reason: Democrats have made their own mockery of inclusion; contends Vice Pres Al Gore has succumbed to left wing of his party on issues of race (M)0</p>

        <p>A lot of people have made fun of the charade of inclusiveness last week at the Republican Convention, as one black or Hispanic speaker after another trooped to the podium. But George W. Bush is likely to benefit from the rainbow parade for a simple reason. The Democrats have made their own mockery of inclusion.</p>
        <p>Just as the G.O.P. platform calls for cultural and ethnic policies favored by the party's fringes, belying Mr. Bush's eloquent pleas for racial equality, Al Gore has succumbed to the left wing of his party on issues of race. Both candidates, knowing that most Americans now genuinely favor inclusiveness, have spun cobwebs of centrist deceit, projecting images of moderation that bear no relation to the underlying intolerance among hard-liners of their respective parties.</p>

        <p>A lot of people have made fun of the charade of inclusiveness last week at the Republican Convention, as one black or Hispanic speaker after another trooped to the podium. But George W. Bush is likely to benefit from the rainbow parade for a simple reason. The Democrats have made their own mockery of inclusion.</p>
        <p>Just as the G.O.P. platform calls for cultural and ethnic policies favored by the party's fringes, belying Mr. Bush's eloquent pleas for racial equality, Al Gore has succumbed to the left wing of his party on issues of race. Both candidates, knowing that most Americans now genuinely favor inclusiveness, have spun cobwebs of centrist deceit, projecting images of moderation that bear no relation to the underlying intolerance among hard-liners of their respective parties.</p>
        <p>From Mr. Bush's convention speech, you'd never know his administration in Texas has imprisoned and executed more African-Americans than any predecessor; that he scuttled a bill to provide health insurance for poor children; and that he is generally hostile to legislation aimed at reducing racial profiling, restraining police brutality or getting the guns that disproportionately kill young blacks and Latinos off the streets.</p>
        <p>No Republican strategist was so naive as to believe minority voters would be taken in by the show in Philadelphia or by the campaign's photo ops at ghetto schools. But the smart-money punditry that this was all aimed at moderate Republicans and independents makes even less sense; they are the nation's most politically savvy and educated voters and can see through the illusion of an aristocratic walk through the barrios.</p>
        <p>Yet the strategy is working. Mr. Bush leads in all national polls. Why? Perhaps because the swing voters sense that Mr. Gore is playing a similar game on the left. The Democrats are certainly more inclusive demographically and favor policies that more directly meet the immediate needs of underprivileged minorities. What is disturbing about Mr. Gore's campaign is that he has yielded to the established minority leadership (like the Congressional Black Caucus and some minority mayors), which is now committed to a conception of inclusiveness that eschews genuine social and cultural integration.</p>
        <p>''Ethnic diversity'' and ''cultural pluralism'' are the buzz words of deception on this side of the spectrum. Certainly on college campuses, diversity no longer means genuine cultural exchange, but the promotion of differences; in politics, the protection of ethnic turfs is at stake. While most African-Americans and the middle classes generally still say they favor integration, some prominent black political leaders have given up on this strategy. The N.A.A.C.P. even had an internal debate over continued support for the ideal of integration.</p>
        <p>I consider this development a disaster, for the simple sociological truth is that the main source of the problems among black Americans is their isolation from the overarching capitalist culture that their leaders misleadingly identify with white society.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore and the Democrats have rightly criticized the growing use of the death penalty and incarceration, and lamented internal problems of the African-American population, like collapsing families and the education gap. But they dare not suggest specific bold solutions for fear of alienating core constituencies: they shy away from ideas to deal with the persistent failure of black students, for example, to avoid offending teachers' unions, and they yield to urban leaders opposed to plans aimed at moving inner-city dwellers to areas that offer better job and educational opportunities.</p>
        <p>Instead we find Mr. Gore playing the identity game to the hilt, one day holding court with Al Sharpton, the next pandering to the fanatical Cuban-American leadership over Elian Gonzalez. Nor did it matter that Cuban-Americans and African-Americans often have strongly opposed interests. Give the demagogues what they want and let them take care of their own.</p>
        <p>What both the Republican and Democratic fringes fail to see or acknowledge is a vigorous ecumenical change sweeping the nation. It bears no affinity to any party or ethnic group. Its most remarkable feature is its market-driven inclusiveness. America continues to absorb vast numbers of newcomers from everywhere, and,  contrary to what multiculturalists imagine, they stay for the sheer liberation of living where they can get any job if they have the skills, can marry across any ethnic or cultural boundary and can live pretty nearly anywhere they want if they can afford to.</p>
        <p>Most Americans have come to accept this genuinely inclusive ecumenical center, even if there are howls of pain and resentment as vested interests and cherished particularisms, left and right, fall by the wayside. That most people reject Buchananite calls for jingoistic exclusion is the best indication of the maturity of the electorate. This is America's real vital center, and it is precisely what the political parties overlook, even as they issue vague pieties about inclusiveness and moving to the center.</p>
        <p>It may be that the genuinely centrist and independent voters consider Mr. Bush's contradictions more palatable, not because they are racists, but because they believe that the long-term consequences for African-Americans, and for a truly integrated America, are not as devastating in Mr. Bush's camp as in the alternative.</p>
