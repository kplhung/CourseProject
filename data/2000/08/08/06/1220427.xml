        <p>A LAW to establish gun-free zones around every school in the county drew support at a public hearing Monday and is expected to win approval by the Board of Legislators next month.</p>
        <p>Of the eight people who spoke, seven were members of the Westchester chapter of the Million Mom March, a nonprofit organization dedicated to gun control.</p>
        <p>The objector, David Fusco, a gun owner from Mamaroneck, called the proposal, which would make it illegal for anyone with a gun to come within 750 feet of school property, ''a way to look like you're doing something'' while ignoring the causes of violence.</p>
        <p>Legislator William J. Ryan, chairman of the Committee on Public Safety, described the measure as ''an additional element of protection for kids,'' but he added, ''Most importantly it increases public awareness of the need to keep schools free of firearms.''</p>
        <p>He said the law, which was proposed by County Executive Andrew J. Spano, would probably be passed when his committee sends it before the Board of Legislators for a vote.</p>
        <p>The law would apply to universities, day-care centers and religious schools as well as elementary and high schools, and violations would be punishable by a year in prison and a $10,000 fine.</p>
        <p>Tracy Pyper, head of the gun policy committee for the Million Mom March, conceded that the law was ''more of a step toward something else,'' observing that the group favors registration of all guns.</p>
        <p>''It is more of a statement,'' she admitted, but added: ''If someone shows up at a school brandishing a weapon, they can throw the book at them. This is close to our goal of keeping guns away from kids.''</p>
        <p>Annette Arthur of Yonkers described how her son Henry was shot in the face on a playground at a public school in Yonkers in 1989 and then survived another shooting.</p>
        <p>''Please pass this legislation,'' she said. ''It's for all of us. It's for the future. You don't have to wait for something to happen to you.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fusco, whose sister was murdered in 1973, said that although he understands how Ms. Arthur feels, the law will make life difficult for law-abiding gun owners.</p>
        <p>''You're basically taking people who obey the law and finding a way to criminalize them,'' Mr. Fusco said.</p>
        <p>While the law provides exceptions for people who live or work in the affected areas and those going to shooting ranges, Mr. Fusco said that with so many institutions affected, it would be hard not to pass through one of the zones. Mr. Ryan said, ''If you have a permit to carry that gun and it is secured properly, you don't have a problem.''</p>
        <p>After the hearing, Mr. Fusco and Ms. Arthur sat down together to discuss their differences. Afterward Ms. Arthur said, ''As with everything, this is just a beginning.''</p>
