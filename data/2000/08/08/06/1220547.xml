        <p>Employers are so anxious for access to the latest crop of M.B.A.'s that a venture capital firm and a leading executive recruiter are counting on them to support a giveaway magazine aimed at university students.</p>
        <p>Eight times a year beginning in September, MBA Jungle will have traditional business articles and lifestyle features. A companion Web site will also include job listings and information about prospective employers, and students will be able to post their resumes.</p>
        <p>The magazine and the Web site (www.mbajungle.com, now in testing)  will be free to M.B.A. students. MBA Jungle and its backers, Ridgewood Capital, a venture firm in Ridgewood, N.J., and Korn/Ferry International, the executive recruiter, hope to make money from advertising and by compiling a national A-list of names and resumes to sell to recruiters and employers.</p>
        <p>To reach its audience and build its subscriber base, MBA Jungle has asked dozens of business schools to distribute its magazine to their students and to link their Web sites to MBA Jungle's. Many schools have agreed, most without charging except to cover distribution costs.</p>
        <p>''We don't do it for the money,'' said Jean Eisel, director of the Carnegie Mellon University's career center. ''Hopefully we are giving our students great information to go out and be successful.'' The  Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania has also signed up.</p>
        <p>But not everyone has been as receptive. At Harvard Business School, Jim Aisner, a spokesman, said a student group was distributing the magazine. The school is very cautious about giving out student names or affiliating itself with outside organizations, he said. ''We would never do anything with anybody's Web site.''</p>
