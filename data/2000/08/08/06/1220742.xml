        <p>ANDORS-Ellen Bess. Died after a long, brave home-based battle with cancer at Cabrini Hospice Unit on Wednesday, August 2. She was 54. Ellen was a dedicated teacher, a brilliant computer programmer, a Ph.D anthropologist, a fabulous cook, an avid gardener, a sometime piano player, a devoted mother. But, above all, she was a tireless fighter for social justice and used all her considerable talents and intelligence on the many causes that caught her attention. She leaves behind her beloved daughter Nora Maya Andors, her grieving father and two brothers, Irving Andors, Stephen and Leon, her beloved and caring aunt Rachel Andors, a supportive and loving group of friends including Carol Buck, Sue Harris, Janet Mayes and Kaarli Tasso. A memorial gathering will be held at her home in the Fall.</p>
