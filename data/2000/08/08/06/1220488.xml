        <p>CONSTRUCTING a simple fence, in a straight line on relatively level ground without a gate, is within the skill level of an intermediate do-it-yourselfer. The hardest part is making an accurate layout, estimating the needed materials and setting the posts.</p>
        <p>First check with community building officials to see if the local codes affect your project. Many codes require that the ''good'' side of the fence project away from the house. Codes often have restrictions on height and how far the fence must be from the property line, the setback.</p>

        <p>CONSTRUCTING a simple fence, in a straight line on relatively level ground without a gate, is within the skill level of an intermediate do-it-yourselfer. The hardest part is making an accurate layout, estimating the needed materials and setting the posts.</p>
        <p>First check with community building officials to see if the local codes affect your project. Many codes require that the ''good'' side of the fence project away from the house. Codes often have restrictions on height and how far the fence must be from the property line, the setback.</p>
        <p>Also check with utility companies to find the location of all underground pipes and cables. Many companies will come to your property and mark the locations for you. When you dig the post holes, stay at least 18 inches from these marks. It is also a good idea to notify your neighbors that you plan to erect a fence. This simple precaution can ease a lot of tensions before they have a chance to fester.</p>
        <p>When you are ready to plan the fence, put in stakes and string to mark its position. The line should be at least six inches within your property line. Be certain you know exactly where your boundary lines are. If you are not sure, hire a surveyor to mark the lines before proceeding.</p>
        <p>After you have determined the length of the fence, map out the sections. Each will be supported at the ends with a post. Fence posts should not be farther apart than eight feet from center to center. To find the total number of posts needed, divide the total length of the fence by eight. If you come up with a remainder, divide again by a slightly smaller number. By adjusting the number through trial and error, you will eventually come up with a whole number. To that number, add one (for an end post), and that will be the number of posts needed. Return to the string line and mark the location of the posts with stakes.</p>
        <p>Each section will be made up of three elements: the posts, the stringers and the pickets. Make a scale drawing of a section, and use it as a guide to help estimate the amount of lumber needed for the entire fence.</p>
        <p>You have already determined how many posts are needed, but you need to figure their length. The posts will be made of 4 by 4 stock. The length will be determined by the height of the post plus enough extra stock to set the posts in the soil. Minimum setting depth is 32 inches. Assume that your fence will be 6 feet high. Add 32 inches to that and you will arrive at fence posts about 8 1/2 feet long.</p>
        <p>Two stringer boards are required for each section. The stringers are the horizontal boards that support the pickets. Use 2 by 4's for the stringers. They will be four inches shorter (to allow for the width of the posts) than the section length.</p>
        <p>Finally, you need to calculate the amount of lumber needed for the pickets. The total number of pickets will be determined by the dimensions of the fence and by its design. First, decide the width of the pickets. Next determine how much space you want between them. You can, if you desire, butt the pickets together so there is no space. This will create a fence that will give you plenty of privacy, but it will also block the breezes.</p>
        <p>If you decide to space the pickets out, consider the picket width and space as an individual unit. Divide that number into the section length. You may have to adjust either the picket width or spaces to arrive at a whole number. Multiply this figure by the number of sections to find the total number of pickets.</p>
        <p>Next, determine the length of the pickets. This is really a design choice. There are only two factors to consider. The pickets should be at least one inch off the ground and they should not be higher than the posts.</p>
        <p>In addition to the lumber, you will also need rust-resist nails made of aluminum or stainless steel, or nails with a galvanized coating. If you decide to set the fence posts in cement (you can use ordinary dirt but the posts will not be as sturdy), you will need about two 80-pound bags per post.</p>
        <p>The best place to order this material is from a lumberyard that sells fencing materials. The dealer can check your estimates and the yard will have a stock of ready-cut fence parts in a variety of woods. Pine is the cheapest wood, but requires periodic maintenance. Cedar and redwood are maintenance-free but more expensive. Next week, this column will describe the technique for building the fence.</p>
