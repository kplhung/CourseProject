        <p>For the 80,000 people who live in the southern part of Staten Island, commuting to Manhattan can take longer than flying to Florida.</p>
        <p>Denise Allegretti said that when she lived in Tottenville, at the southernmost tip of the island, in 1991, she spent at least two hours traveling to  her job as a nurse's aide on the Upper West Side, taking two buses, a ferry and two subway trains.</p>
        <p>Had city express buses served her neighborhood then, she said, she could have ridden one straight through to Midtown in a little over an hour. And she might not have moved a year later to Rosebank, on the north shore, where the buses do run.</p>
        <p>''I have compassion for those folks stuck out on that part of the island,'' she said. ''It's hard for them to maintain a working life.''</p>
        <p>Nine years later, there are still no city express buses from southern Staten Island, though the private Academy bus line provides service from the area. But Academy charges $4 per trip, compared with the city fare of $3, and so residents want city service. And they may get it if Gov. George E. Pataki signs a bill that would require the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to add four express bus routes to the area.</p>
        <p>The bill, sponsored by Assemblywoman Elizabeth A. Connelly, has  passed the Assembly and Senate but not yet reached the governor's desk.  Once it does, the governor will have 30 days to sign it. If he vetoes or fails to sign, the legislature can override him with a two-thirds majority vote, which is unlikely.</p>
        <p>Ms. Connelly has an ally in Transit Now!, a coalition of labor, environmental and civic groups backing the bill. Larry Hanley, president of the Amalgamated Transit Union, Local 726, which is a coalition member, said the bill should be passed because city express bus service has not kept pace with population growth on the south shore.</p>
        <p>''The number of people has probably tripled there in the last 30 years,'' he said, ''but they are relegated to a transit system that their grandfathers used.''</p>
        <p>A spokesman for New York City Transit, Al O'Leary, said his agency opposed the bill because express bus service was more expensive than any other form of mass transit.</p>
        <p>''The buses are subsidized by the city by about $7 per passenger trip,'' he said.</p>
