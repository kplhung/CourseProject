        <p>ON a glowing mid-July evening at Giants Stadium in New Jersey, Derek Pedersen, 11, was settling in to enjoy his first rock concert. Waiting for the show to start, he leaned shyly on the shoulder of his mother, Leslie Pedersen, 43. But later, as the Dave Matthews Band took the stage and built to a crescendo of rhythmic guitar and violin, he climbed aboard his 21-year-old sister's shoulders, threw his arms into the air and swayed rhapsodically with the rest of the crowd.</p>
        <p>A few rows back, Emily and Glenn Blair, an obstetrician and podiatrist, from Easton, Conn., were enjoying a similar musical communion with their daughters, Madeline, 8, and Hillary, 15. Although dressed as country club stalwarts -- he with linen shorts and loafers, she with pearls -- they are rock concert regulars. This was the third Dave Matthews concert the family had attended. Enjoying the jazzy, soulful improvisations that have made the band a favorite among today's college undergraduates is a bonding activity, the Blairs say. ''On the way home in the car, we discuss our favorite guitar riffs,'' Mr. Blair said.</p>

        <p>ON a glowing mid-July evening at Giants Stadium in New Jersey, Derek Pedersen, 11, was settling in to enjoy his first rock concert.

        <p>A few rows back, Emily and Glenn Blair, an obstetrician and podiatrist, from Easton, Conn., were enjoying a similar musical communion with their daughters, Madeline, 8, and Hillary, 15. Although dressed as country club stalwarts -- he with linen shorts and loafers, she with pearls -- they are rock concert regulars. This was the third Dave Matthews concert the family had attended. Enjoying the jazzy, soulful improvisations that have made the band a favorite among today's college undergraduates is a bonding activity, the Blairs say. ''On the way home in the car, we discuss our favorite guitar riffs,'' Mr. Blair said.</p>
        <p>The rock concert, once a raucous and often drug-filled rite of initiation into American adolescence, is slowly becoming a family affair. Parents of teenagers and younger children -- ones who, in their day, treasured concerts as escapes from the parental clutches -- now want to share the experience with their own offspring. It is increasingly easier to do this as the musical tastes of the generations meld -- the 40-plus group of Americans now buy more rock albums than those 15 to 24 -- and as concerts have been tamed by commercial sponsors to be as clean as Broadway musicals.</p>
        <p>''We definitely see that there are two generations that come to see our shows,'' said Paul Tollett, of Golden Voice, a leading West Coast concert promoter of acts like Rage Against the Machine and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. ''Parents nowadays understand music that their kids like, whereas parents 20 years ago would not have gotten the music.''</p>
        <p>Sting, the singer-songwriter, who has been on and off the touring circuit since 1976, says he has watched his audience grow older with him, and expand to the next generation. ''I look out and I see the baby boomers who have been with us since the 70's, and now they have their kids,'' he said. ''It is very multigenerational.''</p>
        <p>In his own home, he added, he has watched his six children, ages 2 to 24, discover music of previous decades on their own. His 9-year-old daughter, Coco Sumner, who is a budding guitarist, likes to pick out tunes from Jimi Hendrix's ''Voodoo Child'' album.</p>
        <p>''The idea that music should separate the generations is a new one,'' Sting said. ''Historically, it used to bring everyone together.''</p>
        <p>Of course, not all bands have a sound that is so convivial or that makes for family togetherness. Not a lot of moms and dads will groove this summer to Eminem or the latest edition of Ozzfest, with its hard-rock headbangers. The acts that the baby boomers grew up with are the ones that are pulling in the largest mixed crowds. This year, five of the top 10 largest grossing concert tours were long-in-the-tooth acts like Bruce Springstein, Tina Turner and Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, according to Pollstar, a concert industry magazine.</p>
        <p>Kids sometimes attend such outings basically at the behest of parents, who hope to pass on their own musical tastes. But in just as many cases. children have been exposed to these favorites on car trips or home stereos and have acquired a love of the artists all their own.</p>
        <p>At a Santana concert at Jones Beach last week, two generations of the Ramirez family gathered in the parking lot drinking beers and blasting ''Supernatural,'' the artist's 1999 smash hit album, from their van's stereo. Pepe Ramirez, 49, who recalls seeing Carlos Santana at the Filmore East in 1969, said he and his brothers played the music at all kinds of family gatherings, beginning when the children were young.</p>
        <p>To prove the point, his niece Laura Benito, 23, hummed hit tunes off the Abraxas album from 1970. ''This is the first time we've all been to a concert together,'' said her brother, Antonio Benito Jr., ''but we grew up listening to this music and I knew it was going to be inevitable that this would happen.''</p>
        <p>The concert industry does not keep records of fans' ages: it is a business dominated by independent-minded impresarios, who judge an act's popularity by the gut. But many performers, promoters and recording executives say they have personally observed that concerts become more multigenerational every year.</p>
        <p>This is not just classic rock nostalgia fueling the graying of the scene. Although boomers do have a soft spot for the artists of their youth, many keep current with music through  VH-1 and radio, and they are responsible, in part, for the success of younger performers like Shania Twain, Macy Gray and Faith Hill.</p>
        <p>The fastest-growing category of customers for rock albums is those 45 and older, according to the Recording Industry Association of America. This middle-aged group bought 24.7 percent of all CD's last year, more than double the 11.1 percent they purchased in 1990. Meanwhile, young people from 15 to 24, widely perceived as the big pop industry drivers, bought a significantly smaller share of recordings than a decade ago.</p>
        <p>Alex Walsh, the vice president of marketing for the recording association, attributed the shift partly to the Internet, which allows busy working parents to shop from their desks. The fact that a larger percentage of the general population is over 40 today than a decade ago also affects the numbers.</p>
        <p>Parents who recall how their love of Janis Joplin or Jimi Hendrix defiantly marked their differences from their own parents now want to share music with their children, hoping it will bridge the generation gap. At a Dixie Chicks concert last month at Radio City Music Hall, none of the three members of the Perrucci family there could remember whether it was Mary Perrucci, 46, or her daughter Christine, 18, who first brought home ''Wide Open Spaces,'' the band's platinum-selling 1998 album. But both parents and daughter listen to the music at home, and Mrs. Perrucci said it brings them closer. ''It gives us something fun to do together,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The fact that parents see concerts as venues for family fun, sometimes even for very young children, also, of course, speaks much about the transformation of concerts themselves. ''Concerts don't have the same rebellious nature,'' said Gary Bongiovanni, the editor of Pollstar, who has  been following the industry for many years. ''It is a more conservative atmosphere these days. It's not just that there are less drugs -- I mean, no one smokes cigarettes.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bongiovanni also said that open concert seating, which was common two decades ago and added to the anarchic nature of events, has been replaced almost entirely with reserved seating. ''Before, it was much more social,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Jim Steen, director of marketing in the Northeast for Delsner/Slater, the nation's largest concert promoter, says rock concerts have become so commercialized that some now resemble Las Vegas floor shows. ''The production of the shows, the lighting, the sound, the amount of extras and dancers is greater than 10 years ago,'' he said. ''There is more emphasis on preshow activity. There is also a different level of expectations, especially from the upper-scale demo. They want V.I.P. areas and fancy boxes and corporate suites.''</p>
        <p>Most rock concerts may no longer be bacchanalias, but they are not Disneyland -- not yet. There can be drugs in the audience, or explicit sexuality from the stage, but parents seem to take these in stride. At the Dave Matthews Band concert at the Meadowlands, a marijuana haze perfumed the air almost as soon as the sun went down. Ms. Pedersen said 11-year-old Derek did not really notice. ''Besides, my feeling is that kids are going to be exposed to it anyway,'' she said. ''I am really strict, and I'd rather be around to explain what is happening if they have questions.''</p>
        <p>Similarly, the lewd antics and graphic lyrics that bothered previous generations of parents slide more easily off this generation's back. At the Dixie Chicks concert, Clare Ryan, 33, and her husband, Kevin, 34, brought their three sons -- John, 5, Liam, 6 1/2, and Danny, 9 -- each of whom had a Norman Rockwell crew cut and a clean-scrubbed face. Mr. Ryan said the kids loved the music but had questions about a song called ''Goodbye Earl,'' about an abused wife who plots to kill her husband.</p>
        <p>''They asked why Earl has to die,'' Mr. Ryan said. ''And I explained that if you grow up and hit your wife, you might deserve to get killed. And they accept that.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most mysterious part of the intergenerational phenomenon is why teenagers seem to accept their parents' company at rock shows so easily. Many used the word ''cool'' to explain their feelings about their parents' presence at the kind of event once framed as a pageant of youth rebellion.</p>
        <p>One possible explanation: with the average price of concert tickets skyrocketing -- up 30 percent in the last  year, to $43.63, according to Pollstar -- bringing Mom and Dad means there is always someone ready with a Visa card.</p>
        <p>There are other conveniences, as well. Zoe Reid, 18, and two teenage friends didn't seem to mind that Zoe's father, Gerald Reid, 51, was sitting next to them at the Dave Matthews concert and passing the time with a hand-held computer. ''What do you think about Gerald being here?'' Zoe asked her friends. ''He's cool,'' one replied. ''And besides, now we have a ride home.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 20, 2000, Sunday  An article on Aug. 6 about the increasing number of parents and children who attend rock concerts together misspelled the surname of a star who has had one of this year's 10 largest-grossing tours. He is Bruce Springsteen, not Springstein.</p>
