        <p>IT was an urban nightmare that ended in murder. Many people remember the date -- March 13, 1964 -- and the place, Kew Gardens, Queens. And everyone recalls the number: 38 people who ignored the cries of the victim.</p>
        <p>People can also tell you where they were when it happened. If they were not in New York, they were afraid to go there. If they were, they were afraid to stay. For it was not just another write-off in a city of danger, where criminals stalk innocents, and people are too numbed to be bothered.</p>

        <p>IT was an urban nightmare that ended in murder. Many people remember the date -- March 13, 1964 -- and the place, Kew Gardens, Queens. And everyone recalls the number: 38 people who ignored the cries of the victim.</p>
        <p>People can also tell you where they were when it happened. If they were not in New York, they were afraid to go there. If they were, they were afraid to stay. For it was not just another write-off in a city of danger, where criminals stalk innocents, and people are too numbed to be bothered.</p>
        <p>This one penetrated that numbness, signifying the absence of a collective conscience. It told an unconcerned society that their unconcern is itself a danger and a crime. For those 38 who remained mute to the killing of Kitty Genovese -- a series of stabbings lasting 30 minutes, just outside their windows -- were accomplices to the crime. And because it can be persuasively argued that society is now even more numbed and unconcerned, it is essential to be reminded of that complicity.</p>
        <p>Paulette Haupt, who moved to Manhattan from Colorado just after the killing, remembers her relatives trying to stop her from going to New York. Thirty-six years later, ''Kitty Genovese's name is imprinted on a whole nation,'' Ms. Haupt said, but who remembers the name of the killer? It is Winston Moseley, who remains in prison, his death sentence overturned, his plea for parole denied.</p>
        <p>Will Todd, an English composer, knew nothing about this chapter in New York's book of shame until until two tears ago, when he met the American playwright David Simpatico at a writers' workshop in Kent. Mr. Simpatico was working on a dramatization of the horrific tale.</p>
        <p>''The moment you hear about it, you know it crosses cultures; it could have happened in any city,'' Mr. Todd said. And somehow a musical collaboration between Mr. Simpatico and Mr. Todd grew out of their perception that it is a horrific tale that must be retold in a bold new way.</p>
        <p>The beginning of their collaboration -- it is titled ''The Screams of Kitty Genovese'' -- was presented last summer at the National Music Theater Conference of the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, which is under the artistic direction of Ms. Haupt. It lasted 20 minutes, ending with the killer raising his knife. ''It created quite a buzz -- after people caught their breath,'' Mr. Todd recalled.</p>
        <p>''The Screams of Kitty Genovese,'' in its second phase of development, is to continue from Wednesday through Saturday at the theater center in Waterford (tickets 860-443-1238).</p>
        <p>In a 12-character chamber musical, 10 chorus members represent a distillation of the infamous 38 witnesses and more. ''They are a chorus and each is an individual,'' Mr. Todd said. ''They are not only Kitty's neighbors, they are the voices inside the head of the killer.'' The other two characters are the victim and the murderer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Todd said his music means to represent ''the circularity of a serial murderer'' -- Kitty Genovese's killer randomly slayed two women before he set upon her. Mr. Todd's music is all the more chilling when it ethereally explores the murderer's delusions of love, his obsession with the women he killed and his sense of betrayal in childhood. As neighbors, the chorus travels from apathy to denial. Ms. Haupt pointed out that Mr. Todd's score is classically based, with the melody of musical theater as well as funk and jazz riffs. In her 23rd year as muse, matchmaker and cheerleader for new musicals, Ms. Haupt said that the National Music Theater Conference laboratory is a new aspect of the conference this summer.</p>
        <p>Eight writers and eight composers, ''who never met before,'' Ms. Haupt said, are creating scenes, songs and short musicals that are to be performed as curtain-raisers for ''The Screams of Kitty Genovese.''</p>
        <p>''We're looking at works in an embryonic stage, not even up to their first draft,'' Ms. Haupt said. The journey from evolving to emerging, ''takes many years,'' Ms. Haupt explained.</p>
        <p>Indeed, it took an O'Neill play to inspire the longest journey so far. ''Desire Under the Elms,'' in an operatic adaptation by Joe Masteroff and Edward Thomas began life at the theater center in Waterford in 1978, was performed at the City Center in Manhattan in 1989 and is being recorded by the London Philharmonic this summer. That's process.</p>
        <p>Some musicals run on a faster track, notably ''Nine,'' Broadway's Tony Award-winning musical of 1982, which was born at the theater centerin Waterford three years earlier.</p>
        <p>In recent seasons that fast lane included ''Violet,'' ''The Wild Party'' (in the version that wound up at Manhattan Theater Club) and ''The Bubbly Black Girl Sheds Her Chameleon Skin'' (which was acclaimed at Playwrights Horizons Off Broadway last month).</p>
        <p>Perhaps the fastest mover of all is Kirsten Childs, who wrote ''Bubbly Black Girl'' -- ''the first musical since 'Rent' that seems born with a wholly healthy, independent heartbeat'' in the words of one critic. On Aug. 8 and 13, ''The Highwayman'' --  book, music and lyrics by Ms. Childs -- will have public performances at the theater center.</p>
        <p>The work, commissioned by the McCarter Theater in Princeton, N. J., is also an important example of an alliance between two theatrical organizations.</p>
        <p>Then there is ''Hoochy Koo and the Mack.'' It is in development only, not yet for public viewing. Ms. Childs wrote that one too, but not the book, which is by Walter Mosley. Sometimes a bubbly creator has to know where to draw the line.</p>
        <p>In gathering the new sounds of musical theater, Ms. Haupt said, these composers have to find their own voices. And in finding his, Mr. Todd has been listening to the voice of Kitty Genovese and to the choral sounds of silence.</p>
