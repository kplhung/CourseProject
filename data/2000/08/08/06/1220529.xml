        <p>UNTIL recently, Nadja Swarovski wore a bracelet of rose quartz beads said to bring the wearer luck in love. ''But it was no use at all,'' she complained. So these days Ms. Swarovski, the New York representative of an Austrian crystal company founded by her family, puts her faith in a wide mesh cuff that might have come straight out of ''Gladiator.''</p>
        <p>In her arsenal of charms, the outsize bauble is an item of heavy artillery. ''It makes me think of Wonder Woman -- I find it very empowering,'' said Ms. Swarovski, who wears the cuff in the hope it will give her an aura of Glamazonian invulnerability.</p>
        <p>When Estelle Leeds, a New York photo agent, needs a little boost from the spirit world, she piles on jade bracelets, whose soothing green hue is believed in the Far East to possess healing qualities. The magic of such amulets may be mostly in the wearer's mind, but don't tell that to Ms. Leeds. ''Jade has had a good effect on my business,'' she insisted. ''Since I've worn it, I seem to get a lot more work.''</p>
        <p>Both women are members of the vastly expanding tribe of New Yorkers who, trusting nothing to chance, attempt to ward off evil or beguile the gods by draping themselves in exotic beads and talismans. Beetles and Buddhas, scarabs, pentagrams and pale pink quartz -- any of these may function as a symbol of sincere religious belief. But in the age of Spirituality Lite, they are also likely to attest to the wearer's inner grooviness, just as her Jimmy Choo mules speak of her up-to-date chic.</p>
        <p>Which might go a way toward explaining why they have lately cast their spell not just on neo-hippies, religious seekers and the doggedly contrarian souls who first gave them cachet in the 1960's, but also on fashion addicts and otherwise conventional types with no particular New Age creed.</p>
        <p>So ubiquitous is the second group that a random survey in Times Square the other day turned up no fewer than one in four passersby wearing some interpretation of a charm or amulet -- jewelry believed by some cultures to be imbued with magic to ward off evil or bring good luck.</p>
        <p>''You certainly see a lot of this jewelry -- everything from Egyptian ankhs to Celtic and Druid symbols,'' said Richard Leonard, a vice president at the Zandl Group, a New York youth-marketing firm, whose clients include the Limited. ''Whether people are buying them for their aesthetic value or their spiritual heritage I'm not sure, but talismans and charms have definitely crossed into the mainstream.''</p>
        <p>At boutiques and gift shops, in airports and on street corners, charm vendors are springing up like ragweed, selling Mideastern Hands of Fatima and miniature Chinese turtles, alongside knockoffs of last year's wildly popular crystal-beaded power bracelet.</p>
        <p>H&amp;M, the cheap-chic emporium on Fifth Avenue, peddles a version of the power bracelet that is so cheap ($2) that shoppers buy them by the fistful. The store also offers geometric-beaded chokers and feathered necklaces that look as if they had been pilfered from a Native American burial ground.</p>
        <p>Kirna Zabete, MZ Wallace and Hedra Prue are among the downtown Manhattan purveyors of hip who keep reinventing the lucky charm genre. Their inventory includes crystal drop ''energy'' earrings and pendants, and the latest twist on the power bracelet, a slender piece of rawhide or scarlet ribbon meant to stay knotted on the wrist until the wearer's wish comes true.</p>
        <p>Kamuti Kiteme, the president and co-founder of Polyverse, an Internet company, rarely removes his Buddha pendant, a small gold charm that was a gift from his kick-boxing partner. ''Call it a luck charm, if you will,'' he said. ''It keeps bad things from happening to you.''</p>
        <p>Desmond Morris, the social anthropologist and author of ''Body Guards'' (Elements, 1999), a coffee-table book about amulets, said in an interview that, judging by the masses of New Yorkers and Londoners he has seen sporting charms, a great many people feel the world is a menacing place, and they need protection from the spirit world.</p>
        <p>''You can laugh, but I blame TV news,'' Mr. Morris, said, emitting a small groan. ''Every time you turn it on, you see another disaster. You can't escape.''</p>
        <p>Amulets can also symbolize an aversion to technology, said Mr. Leonard, the marketing consultant. ''All these new tools that people are using but don't understand -- that's what's fueling contemplation of greater powers.''</p>
        <p>In an increasingly complex and artificial world, ''people find comfort in something that is natural,'' said Kazuko, a first-name-only designer of raw-crystal-and-gold-wire jewelry sold at Barneys New York (devotees include Bianca Jagger and Sue Mengers, the Hollywood agent).</p>
        <p>Michele Quan and Robin Renzi, who own Me &amp; Ro, a New Age-inspired line of jewelry, are offering silver cuffs and bangles with Sanskrit inscriptions from the Bhagavad-Gita. And when Aurora Lopez and Steven Alan open Borealis, a jewelry boutique, in NoLIta this month, they will showcase silver amulets by a Mexican jewelry designer, Beth Orduna, and handbags by Jade Jagger embroidered with trident symbols. ''All these things resonate magic,'' Ms. Lopez declared.</p>
        <p>For some designers, they also resonate healing powers. Zoe Metro, the designer for Stella Pace, one of the companies that spawned last summer's power bracelet mania, is packaging her latest collection of gold and lapis, bronze and onyx beads in plastic prescription-drug vials. The labels say things like ''prescribed to infuse your being with love,'' and  ''Career Queen . . . glass ceilings beware.''</p>
        <p>Even fashion and beauty heavyweights like M.A.C., the cosmetics maker, and Danskin, of leotard fame, now use charms to promote or enhance their products. M.A.C. is offering an amulet with a groove designed to hold its fragrances. And Danskin recently sent fashion editors samples of its new ''Zen'' yoga togs, packaged with polished, quarter-size pebbles. The pebbles are meant to be rubbed between forefinger and thumb -- a Zen-inspired variation on worry beads.</p>
        <p>Wearing amulets, the more outlandish the better, is partly a legacy of the 60's. During that decade, spiritual and cultural sampling became the order of the day. Many people took a kind of supermarket approach to religion, shopping from a variety of choices before finding a faith that suited them.</p>
        <p>The wearing of charms today suggests a similar mind-set. ''Some people feel that amulets attract or bring forward the power they represent,'' said Joe Zuchowski, who manages Enchantments, a Manhattan boutique for aspiring Wiccans, or modern-day witches. ''But,'' he added offhandedly, ''other people might wear them because they go with their outfit.''</p>
        <p>Sometimes, wearing charms attests to nothing more than a gauzy wishful thinking. On a recent trip to Hawaii, Ally Tomi, a creative director at Coty International, the cosmetics giant, bought a chain with a pendant that reads ''Aloha.'' She wears it wherever she goes.</p>
        <p>''It helps me create my own little aura and gets me through my New York life,'' Ms. Tomi said. ''Sure, the taxi driver is screaming at me, but I'm thinking 'aloha,' '' she said, pronouncing the word with a lilt. ''It creates a sense of peace.''</p>
        <p>''I'm wearing this for myself, not for other people,'' she said. ''Still, when they read 'aloha,' their mood might change, too.''</p>
