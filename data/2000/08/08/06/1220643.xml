        <p>When Montreal's huge gay pride parade rolls through downtown on Sunday, organizers expect more than 100 marching groups and 500,000 people, either watching or walking. Oddly, the parade will march without the one Montrealer whose recent coming out caused the biggest media debate over homosexuality that French Canada has seen in years.</p>

        <p>When Montreal's huge gay pride parade rolls through downtown on Sunday, organizers expect more than 100 marching groups and 500,000 people, either watching or walking. Oddly, the parade will march without the one Montrealer whose recent coming out caused the biggest media debate over homosexuality that French Canada has seen in years.</p>
        <p>''I find these pride parades ridiculous,'' said Daniel Pinard, a celebrity television chef, whose congenial disposition masks a cantankerous spirit. ''I have always hated parades, all these people singing to the same tune.''</p>
        <p>Last New Year's Eve, Mr. Pinard decided, at age 57, to stop smoking, to stop drinking, and to make public his homosexuality. The decision by Mr. Pinard, a prominent member of Quebec's celebrity star system, to speak publicly about being gay set off Quebec's most publicized coming out.</p>
        <p>''I did 11 TV shows, 16 radio programs, and I got 4,000 letters,'' Mr. Pinard said recently over dinner, a gastronomic excursion in which he never sipped wine or lit up a cigarette and largely talked about what it is like to be gay in Quebec.</p>
        <p>When the big day for his announcement arrived last March, Le Journal de Montreal, a tabloid that reminds its readers daily that it is ''the number one French daily of America,'' used yellow ink to highlight the headline on the cooking star's decision to talk of his ''homosexualite.'' A soap opera star magazine ran his photo on its cover, and upscale French newspapers devoted dozens of columns and articles to digesting his decision.</p>
        <p>On one level, media attention mushroomed because a familiar household figure for the last 25 years had decided to talk about being gay. But in the largely laissez faire society of Quebec, interest seemed to grow because when Mr. Pinard came out, he came out against something: homophobic television comedy shows and radio talk shows.</p>
        <p>This city of commuters offers a wide selection of radio talk show hosts pandering to the perceived prejudices of their audiences, largely suburban white men trapped behind steering wheels. In the late afternoons, comedy shows take over, pitching raunchy fare to teenagers.</p>
        <p>One television program, ''Piment Fort,'' or ''Hot Pepper,'' had degenerated into ''mean programming, where they make fun of gay people, of short people, of ugly people, of fat people,'' Mr. Pinard said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pinard, a silver-haired man who still burns with resentment over the day half a century ago when a schoolmate taunted him with an insulting French term for homosexual, decided to denounce ''Piment Fort'' on an intellectual talk show.</p>
        <p>The response was overwhelmingly positive. ''Of all the letters I got, only 10 were opposed,'' said Mr. Pinard. ''I had police cars stop, and policemen get out to congratulate me.''</p>
        <p>Not only did his appearances lead to discussions of attitudes toward gays, but the province started debating the subject of bullying in general. One letter came from a 10-year-old boy who said he was lampooned at school because he stuttered.</p>
        <p>People involved with producing the show have taken a low profile, refusing to speak with most journalists. On Wednesday, Jean Bissonnette, the producer, said in a brief interview: ''We don't have any comments to offer. We don't want to feed what we call the Pinard affair. He has his own cause to push.''</p>
        <p>Normand Brathwaite, the show's host, boasted last spring to Journal de Montreal, ''I back up what I say.''</p>
        <p>While television land's celebrity chef may have scored points for tolerance, his outspokenness began to antagonize other gay people after he started last month to serve as spokesman for Gai Ecoute, this city's leading gay telephone hot line and social service referral service.</p>
        <p>''The only ones who have attacked me, were the gay press,'' Mr. Pinard said over a plate of quail at his favorite St. Catherine's Street restaurant, Le Paris.</p>
        <p>Montreal's thriving gay press wondered why Mr. Pinard should be considered a gay spokesman when he called Montreal's gay community a ''ghetto,'' and said that, if there were a pill to become a heterosexual, he would take it in 30 seconds.</p>
        <p>Rejecting the gay label as his overriding identity, he said: ''Ambiguity is the zest of life. I hate it when they categorize you in a little category.''</p>
        <p>These views, gay leaders and journalists contend, are insensitive to gay people in Quebec.</p>
        <p>''He really expressed a lot of disdain for the gay community, and that created a chill,'' said Yves Lafontaine, editor of Fugue, a gay magazine. ''He can have his own opinions, but not as spokesman for Gai Ecoute.''</p>
        <p>So at the march on Sunday, Mayor Pierre Bourque of Montreal will be riding atop the lead limousine for Gai Ecoute. The mayor, a heterosexual, will be filling in for Gai Ecoute's spokesman, the man who set the city talking this year about homosexuality.</p>
