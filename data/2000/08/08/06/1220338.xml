        <p>Virgin Atlantic Airways says passengers can now receive calls made to their cellular telephone number during flights.</p>
        <p>Passengers get a card with a magnetic strip and an identification number from their cell phone service. Swiping the card at the phone at the passenger's seat and entering the identification number activates the service, which is provided by the BT Aeronautical division of British Telecommmunications.</p>
        <p>Callers who dial the individual's cell phone number will have their calls routed to the telephone at the Virgin passenger's seat. There is no extra charge to the callers, but the passenger will pay a per-minute fee of $8 for incoming calls and $9 for outgoing calls.</p>
        <p>This Skyphone Mobile Connect is available only for cell phones using GSM, the dominant cell phone technology outside the United States. Virgin Atlantic said that it eventually expected to expand the service to American-style cell phones.</p>
        <p>Another airline, Air Canada, said that in October it will make it possible for passengers on its Boeing 767's to use their laptops to gain access to the Internet and get and send e-mail messages. After six months, it will decide whether to expand the service, which is provided by Tenzing Communications of Seattle.</p>
