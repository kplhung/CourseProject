        <p>It's not an old record, but it's been shredded. Last Wednesday, Ozzie Canseco, a first baseman and designated hitter for the Newark Bears -- and twin brother of Jose Canseco, who now plays for Tampa Bay -- broke the Atlantic League single-season home run record with his 34th dinger. In a day game against the Nashua Pride at Riverfront Stadium in Newark (the Bears won, 10-9), Canseco first tied Juan Thomas of the Atlantic City Surf, who hit 33 in the league's inaugural season in 1998, and then he surpassed him with his second long ball of the afternoon. And since there were 53 more games left in the schedule, the new record was sure to grow much larger. Canseco, 36, who had three brief stints in the big leagues -- and is still being scouted by American League teams -- started as a pitcher but moved to other positions after he tore a rotator cuff. As of midweek he was hitting .319, leading in slugging percentage with .702 and leading in R.B.I. with 93.</p>
