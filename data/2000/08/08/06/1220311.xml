        <p>In 1978, George W. Bush's first campaign ad showed him jogging through Lubbock, Tex. It didn't help him. The only folks who run around here, his opponent joked, are trying to get away from someone. Two decades later, when the cardiovascular health of Bush's vice-presidential running mate, Dick Cheney, is front-page news, it's hard to imagine the public electing someone who doesn't jog -- or at least make all the right claims about physical fitness. (Bush's spokeswoman, Karen Hughes, in fact, made sure to emphasize that when Bush called Cheney to offer him the position, Cheney was on the treadmill and could not answer the phone.) But who could beat whom in a real race?</p>

        <p>In 1978, George W. Bush's first campaign ad showed him jogging through Lubbock, Tex. It didn't help him. The only folks who run around here, his opponent joked, are trying to get away from someone. Two decades later, when the cardiovascular health of Bush's vice-presidential running mate, Dick Cheney, is front-page news, it's hard to imagine the public electing someone who doesn't jog -- or at least make all the right claims about physical fitness. (Bush's spokeswoman, Karen Hughes, in fact, made sure to emphasize that when Bush called Cheney to offer him the position, Cheney was on the treadmill and could not answer the phone.) But who could beat whom in a real race?</p>
        <p>GEORGE W. BUSH</p>
        <p>EXERCISE  Runs 4 to 6 miles daily. Also uses the treadmill and the elliptical trainer two days a week; lifts weights one or two days a week. Counts hunting, fishing and horseshoes among his regular fitness activities.</p>
        <p>LAND SPEED  Before arthroscopic surgery to repair torn cartilage in his left knee: 7 minutes per mile. Post surgery: 7:30. Has run a 10K in 42 minutes and a 5K in 20:20.</p>
        <p>RUNNING MATE  ''I prefer to run alone, but I no longer have that luxury.''</p>
        <p>WHY HE RUNS  ''After my father's loss in 1992, I made running the Dallas Marathon, which was in December, my goal. Running became my therapy for getting over the disappointment and frustration of the presidential campaign. Apparently, I ran too far and too fast. I got a severe cold and then a stern lecture from my doctor. But that changed my plans only slightly -- I decided to shoot for the Houston Marathon in January, which I completed in 3 hours 44 minutes.''</p>
        <p>AL GORE</p>
        <p>EXERCISE  Runs between 3.5 and 7 miles at least four times a week. Also curls dumbbells, which the Secret Service carries on trips for him, and does push-ups and sit-ups aboard Air Force Two. Counts canoeing and hiking among his regular fitness activities.</p>
        <p>LAND SPEED  Between 8 and 9 minutes per mile. SGMA Capital Challenge (1998), 3 miles: 27.04</p>
        <p>MARATHONER?  Ran 1997 Marine Corps Marathon with two daughters. Time for all three: 4:58:25. ''For a big guy, with his body type, he really does move well,'' says Ellen Hart Pena, a member of the President's Council on Physical Fitness.</p>
        <p>WEIGHTY THOUGHTS  Gore has been quoted as claiming: ''Making decisions is a little bit like working out with weights. When you start working out, you may get sore and the gains don't come very quickly, but if you hang in there, then you begin to build up and get stronger. I think there is a decision-making muscle, and I think it gets stronger the more you use it.''</p>
