        <p>AUSTRALIA has well-deserved credentials as one of the great sporting nations of the world, but its reputation in the arts is a more recent phenomenon. For visitors to the Olympic Games, the Sydney Olympic Arts Festival, with its roster of dance, music, art, theater and film, offers an enticing bonus, a way to appreciate the rich and diverse culture of this antipodean nation and place Australia's artistic achievements in an international context. The six-week-long festival actually starts a full month before the Games commence, to set the stage and to showcase the full scope of arts offerings.</p>
        <p>At daybreak on Aug. 18 on Congwong Bay in La Perouse, southeast of the city, the dawn call of the Eora people -- the Aboriginal tribe of the Sydney area -- begins a day of welcoming the world to the festival. The Aboriginal opera singer and actor Deborah Cheetham will join other female singers in arias accompanied by local musicians playing traditional instruments. These ceremonies, entitled ''Tubowgule'' (pronounced TIE-bah-gool), meaning ''The Meeting of the Waters,'' continue at noon in the Royal Botanic Gardens with traditional male dancing, body painting and story telling, all of which pay respect to ancestral traditions.</p>

        <p>AUSTRALIA has well-deserved credentials as one of the great sporting nations of the world, but its reputation in the arts is a more recent phenomenon. For visitors to the Olympic Games, the Sydney Olympic Arts Festival, with its roster of dance, music, art, theater and film, offers an enticing bonus, a way to appreciate the rich and diverse culture of this antipodean nation and place Australia's artistic achievements in an international context. The six-week-long festival actually starts a full month before the Games commence, to set the stage and to showcase the full scope of arts offerings.</p>
        <p>At daybreak on Aug. 18 on Congwong Bay in La Perouse, southeast of the city, the dawn call of the Eora people -- the Aboriginal tribe of the Sydney area -- begins a day of welcoming the world to the festival. The Aboriginal opera singer and actor Deborah Cheetham will join other female singers in arias accompanied by local musicians playing traditional instruments. These ceremonies, entitled ''Tubowgule'' (pronounced TIE-bah-gool), meaning ''The Meeting of the Waters,'' continue at noon in the Royal Botanic Gardens with traditional male dancing, body painting and story telling, all of which pay respect to ancestral traditions.</p>
        <p>As dusk falls, the forecourt of the Sydney Opera House is the setting for the climax of the welcoming ceremony, choreographed by Stephen Page, artistic director of Australia's leading indigenous performing arts group, the Bangarra Dance Theatre. Dancers and children will be accompanied by Marc Newson's dramatic lighting of the opera house in aqueous patterns.</p>
        <p>This is one episode of his four-part ''subliminal lighting'' installation, ''Energy of Australia,'' which will transform the Opera House every night during the Festival. In this first installation, the desired effect is that the 21st century will seem to disappear into the earliest times of Australia's first inhabitants. All three of the ''Tubowgule'' events are free.</p>
        <p>This sense of drama and spectacle permeates the festival, according to Leo Schofield, the festival's director. ''I felt that it was important to mount events of scale since the Olympic Games are the most important international festival of all,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Thus, the first musical event, on Aug. 19, is Mahler's Symphony No. 8, the Symphony of a Thousand, at the SuperDome in the heart of the Olympic Park. ''I see this symphony as the invocation of the creative spirit and, as such, I hope it will be a cultural highlight,'' Mr. Schofield said.</p>
        <p>Edo de Waart conducts the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, which will be joined by an international roster of soloists, including Alessandra Marc, Elizabeth Connell, Jane Henschel, Vinson Cole and massed choirs from Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra and Britain. ''It is a little quirky, too, staging a classical symphony in a sports stadium, but it is important to make the link between sport and art and to emphasize that the arts festival is part of the action, not elitist and separate,'' Mr. Schofield added.</p>
        <p>Olympic arts festivals were enshrined in the modern Olympic Games ethos by Baron Pierre de Coubertin, who revived the Games in the late 19th century. ''Olympism,'' Coubertin said, ''is the concept of strong physical culture, based in one part upon the spirit of chivalry and, for the other, upon aesthetic sensitivity.'' Thus in both the ancient and early modern Olympic Games a country might win gold not only for discus throwing but also for poetry.</p>
        <p>While this sentiment appears a little naive in our high-stakes sports world and while it would be politically imprudent to find judges for artistic events today, Sydney's full-scale Olympic Arts Festival is a salute to the baron's aims. On the eve of the opening ceremony of the competition, Sept. 14, the festival and the games will be united in the Olympic Torch Galas at the Sydney Opera House. The ballet superstar Sylvie Guillem will appear with stars of Opera Australia and the Australian Ballet at the Opera Theater, while the tenor Andrea Bocelli will perform at the Concert Theater.</p>
        <p>The Olympic torch will arrive at the opera house en route to the Olympic Stadium, and as the torchbearer runs up the steps, the opera house itself will appear to burst into flames in another of Mr. Newson's installations.</p>
        <p>So what are the festival's themes? ''I wanted to emphasize the celebratory nature of this international event,'' Mr. Schofield said. ''And considering the fact that many visitors are not English speaking, I placed a strong focus on dance and music. There is also a highlight on youth at the dawning of a new century.''</p>
        <p>About 70 percent of the performing and visual arts events are Australian, with some remarkable indigenous Australian work. These are benchmarked against a diverse array of international talent. Here are some highlights:</p>
        <p>Dance</p>
        <p>There is an embarrassment of riches in the dance offerings, from Pina Bausch and her Tanztheater Wuppertal's ''Masurca Fogo,'' from Aug. 30 to Sept. 3 at the Capitol Theater, to Graeme Murphy's epic ''Mythologia,'' performed by the Sydney Dance Company and the 60-member Sydney Gay and Lesbian Choir from Aug. 19 to 26, also at the Capitol. Lin Hwai-Min's Cloud Gate Dance Theater performs ''Nine Songs'' (which begins with the image of a magical water-filled lotus pond and ends with 800 candles leading into a star-filled night sky) Aug. 19 to 22, and the tai-chi-based ''Moon Water,'' Aug. 25 to 27 at Her Majesty's Theater, danced to Bach's Six Suites for Solo Cello.</p>
        <p>The Bangarra Dance Theatre performs ''Skin,'' a new work in two parts by Stephen Page. ''Shelter'' is inspired by the cultural world of the women of Utopia, in Australia's Central Desert region, highlighted by the art of Emily Kngwarreye.</p>
        <p>''Spear'' is a collaboration with the Aboriginal singer-songwriter Archie Roach and forges a new urban identity for Aboriginal men, from Sept. 19 to 30 at the Sydney Opera House Drama Theater. The New York choreographer Bill T. Jones uses an astonishing range of music in his latest work, ''You, Walk,'' to explore the blending of different cultures Aug. 31 to Sept. 4 at Her Majesty's Theater.</p>
        <p>Music and Opera</p>
        <p>The violinist Maxim Vengerov performs Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra Sept. 29 and 30 at the Sydney Opera House Concert Hall. The orchestra  will also be performing Wagner's ''Gotterdammerung'' in concert Sept. 5 and 8 at the Concert Hall.</p>
        <p>Simone Young, the only woman to have conducted the Paris Opera, will conduct Opera Australia in a new production of Verdi's ''Simon Bocca negra'' on Aug. 30 and eight days in September at the opera house. Riccardo Muti conducts the Orchestra Filarmonica Della Scala performing works from an all-Italian repertory Sept. 27 and 28 at the Opera House Concert Hall.</p>
        <p>The Asian Youth Orchestra, representing outstanding young musicians across the continent, teams up with the Beaux Arts Trio on Aug. 26, as well as the Chinese-Australian violinist Cho-Liang Lin on Aug. 25, both at the Opera House Concert Hall. The violinist Pinchas Zukerman plays Beethoven's Violin Concerto and Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra with Australia's premier youth orchestra, the Global Freeway Australian Youth Orchestra on Sept. 1, also at the Opera House Concert Hall.</p>
        <p>The amplified strings of the Australian Chamber Orchestra joins with New York's Bang on a Can's rock-classical lineup of cello, bass, keyboards, percussion, electric guitar, saxophone and clarinet to present new works by the Australian composer Brett Dean and the British composer Steve Martland. And the German cabaret singer Ute Lemper also stars in two concerts at the Concert Hall, on Sept. 17 and 24.</p>
        <p>Theater</p>
        <p>The British company DV8 Physical Theater straddles the boundaries of dance and theater and challenges conventional notions of both. Its Australian-born producer, Lloyd Newton, is creating a new work for the festival, which will later open in London. The play, at the Everts Theater, Seymour Theater Center, Aug. 16 to Sept. 3, explores perfection and pretense, how society measures individuals and how they, in turn, value themselves.</p>
        <p>Neil Armfield directs an Australian cast in Company B. Belvoir's adaptation of ''The Marriage of Figaro'' at the Sydney Opera House Drama Theater, Aug. 19 to Sept. 14. Students of the Australian National Institute of Dramatic Art present the premier of ''There Is No Need to Wake Up,'' a hallucinogenic fantasy inspired by Sigmund Freud, Aug. 31 to Sept. 14 at the Opera House Playhouse.</p>
        <p>Gale Edwards directs the Sydney Theater Company in the Jacobean thriller ''The White Devil'' Aug. 18 to Sept. 13 at the Theater Royal. Michael Bogdanov directs the Bell Shakespeare Company (Australia's national Shakespeare company) in a radical interpretation of Shakespeare's antiwar play ''Troilus and Cressida,''  Sept. 18 to 30 at the Sydney Opera House Playhouse.</p>
        <p>And for all of September, the young performers of Australia's renowned Flying Fruit Fly Circus team up with performers from the Shanghai Acrobatic Troupe of China under the Big Top in Prince Albert Park.</p>
        <p>Visual Arts</p>
        <p>From Aug. 18 to Nov. 12, the Art Gallery of New South Wales is presenting ''Papunya Tula: Genesis and Genius.'' This landmark exhibition highlights the key role of the Western Desert art movement of the 1970's, when Western media like canvas and acrylic began to be used by indigenous Australian artists.</p>
        <p>The gallery is also saluting 20 Australian icons of visual art -- including Tom Roberts, Russell Drysdale and Sidney Nolan -- from Aug. 4 to Oct. 29, as well as mounting an exhibition of fragments of the Dead Sea Scrolls through Oct. 15.</p>
        <p>The Museum of Contemporary Art will show a retrospective of the Aboriginal urban artist Lin Onus, this Friday through Oct. 29, and highlight the work of six international and Australian installation artists as they explore the intersection of art and sport Aug. 16 to Nov. 13.</p>
        <p>At the Powerhouse Museum, Leonardo's masterwork of art and science ''The Codex Leicester'' is on loan from Bill Gates from Sept. 6 to Nov. 5. Also on view through Nov. 15 is ''1,000 Years of the Olympic Games,'' sculptural and ceramic treasures from ancient Greece.</p>
        <p>Through Dec. 3, the Museum of Sydney will offer a major photographic survey, ''Sydneysiders,'' by Lorrie Graham.</p>
        <p>Potpourri</p>
        <p>In addition to all these events, performances and exhibitions, there are  two more festivals within the Olympic Arts Festival.</p>
        <p>Hemispheres, a festival of music from around the globe, Sept. 9 and 10 at Centennial Park, will star more than 40 contemporary, Latin, world, funk, dance and blues acts performing on two stages with D.J.'s and dancers. Juan de Marcos's Afro-Cuban All Star band is a highlight.</p>
        <p>Sunscreen Sydney, a celebration of cinema from Sept. 1 to 10, will offer a free program of Australian classic films, which will be shown in five unusual locations. They include Bruce Beresford's ''Breaker Morant'' at St. Andrew's Square; Fred Schepisi's ''The Devil's Playground'' at Cathedral Square; George Miller's ''The Man From Snowy River'' at Hyde Park, and Peter Weir's ''The Cars That Ate Paris'' on the top floor of the Enacom Car Park, King Street.</p>
        <p>Other highlights will include dinner conversations with Australia's best-known filmmakers, a mainstream international cinema champions program at Hoyts Paris Cinemas and a free national short-film competition, at the Fox Studios backlot, Sept. 4 to 10.
