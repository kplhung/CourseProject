        <p>WHEN Trevor Mallard became New Zealand's Minister of Education several months ago, one of his first steps was to bolster direct government assistance to troubled urban schools.</p>
        <p>Although the programs he announced were hardly unusual -- more money for early-childhood education, clustering of schools with common problems, a bigger national investment in teacher training -- they were notable far beyond this island nation. The reason: they signaled the end of a decade-long flirtation with the notion that parental choice and competition among schools would, in and of themselves, improve the educational offerings of troubled urban schools.</p>
        <p>''We're definitely moving away from the nonintervention approach,'' Mr. Mallard said in a recent interview in his office here. ''Our goal is to close gaps between rich and poor schools, not widen them.''</p>
        <p>For the last 10 years, New Zealand has provided a laboratory for many of the educational theories that have become increasingly popular among would-be reformers in the United States in recent years, most notably charter schools and vouchers.</p>
        <p>With a population of 3.8 million, New Zealand is roughly comparable to an American state, and its Ministry of Education is the functional equivalent of a state department of education in the decentralized American system. It has social, cultural and political traditions similar to those in the United States and, perhaps most important, a significant minority population.</p>
        <p>Those minorities, Maori and Pacific Islanders, many of whom live in urban areas, make up 20 percent of the population, and schools affirm their cultures, both through the formal curriculum and through extracurricular activities and festivals.</p>
        <p>As in the United States, success in school correlates closely with socioeconomic status. Large numbers of Maori and Pacific Island pupils come from low-income families, and their collective achievement levels are well below those of white students. At high schools -- which are called colleges -- administrators have taken steps to deal with such obstacles to learning as iron deficiency, high cholesterol rates and family violence. For example, they have created a health clinic at Tamaki College in South Auckland.</p>
        <p>In 1989, New Zealand embarked on what is arguably the most radical overhaul of a state education system ever taken by an industrialized country. The first step was taken by a Labor government that abolished the country's heavy-handed central educational bureaucracy and turned the running of all primary and secondary schools over to locally elected boards of trustees dominated by parents.</p>
        <p>Two years later, in 1991, a new National government committed to free-market principles added to the reform mix by giving parents the right to choose which school their children would attend. Schools that attracted more applicants than they could accommodate had considerable discretion over which ones to accept.</p>
        <p>Under the package of reforms, known collectively as Tomorrow's Schools, the central Ministry of Education continues to fund schools, draft national curriculum guidelines and operate an accountability system under which teams from an independent Education Review Office visit schools.</p>
        <p>Many school reformers in the United States and other developed countries see governance changes like those adopted in New Zealand as a key to improving the quality of public schools, including those serving disadvantaged students. The core argument is that if schools are freed from bureaucratic controls and forced to compete for students, they will have both the means and the incentives to become successful.</p>
        <p>Since New Zealand has no national standardized tests, it is not possible to measure the impact of Tomorrow's Schools on student achievement. Nevertheless, it is evident that self-governance and parental choice were generally popular and that they had an energizing effect on many primary and secondary schools in middle- and upper-middle-income communities.</p>
        <p>The Gladstone Primary School in Auckland, for example, has prospered by offering a program organized around the theory of multiple intelligences articulated by Howard Gardner, a Harvard University psychologist. ''No one is restricting us,'' said Colin Dale, the principal. ''The potential is now there to do whatever you want. It's all about meeting needs and performing. If you get it right, people will flock to you.''</p>
        <p>On the negative side, however, the educational marketplace has polarized enrollment patterns by ethnicity and seriously complicated the problems of schools serving large disadvantaged populations.</p>
        <p>Research shows that New Zealand parents of all races judge the quality of schools in part by the ethnic mix of their students. Schools with a preponderance of European students are seen as superior to those with large numbers of Maori and Pacific Islanders. In the new educational marketplace during the 1990's, student transfers caused schools that had served predominantly white students to grow in size, while those that served large numbers of minorities saw their rolls decrease.</p>
        <p>DATA from the Ministry of Education show, for example, that here in Wellington the proportion of Maori and Pacific Island students in primary and intermediate schools who ranked lowest in socioeconomic status increased to 84 percent from 76 percent between 1991 and 1996. A recent study by the government-supported New Zealand Council for Educational Research also reported that the intended reforms ''appear to have acted in an unintended manner, which has increased ethnic polarization.''</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, competition has produced both winners and losers. Popular schools have been able to fill their rolls with students from family backgrounds conducive to academic success, while undersubscribed schools, which by law must accept all comers, must now cope with greater concentrations of difficult-to-teach students -- those from impoverished homes, with weak English skills or with learning problems. Ministry data show that suspended students are likely to end up in a school with a higher concentration of poor and minority group students than the school from which they were suspended.</p>
        <p>By the mid-1990's New Zealanders had come to speak of downwardly ''spiraling'' schools in which declining enrollments and the subsequent loss of teachers and other academic resources compound the challenges they face. A student at one such high school in Auckland, Tangaroa College, said that she dreamed of going into medicine but feared that she would not be adequately prepared. ''At our school, dreams seem so far away,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Market theory holds that if schools lose the capacity to attract a sufficient number of students, they will close their doors and other schools will come along to serve their students. But that shift rarely occurred in New Zealand, partly because it is politically difficult to close a school and partly because there were few</p>
        <p>incentives for educational entrepreneurs to move in unpromising situations.</p>
        <p>Faced with mounting political pressure to rescue troubled urban schools, the National government began in the late 1990's to look for ways to assist them. Policy makers did so reluctantly, however, knowing that under the theory of the educational marketplace, there was no justification for direct intervention.</p>
        <p>Initial efforts centered on improving the management skills of principals in troubled schools. It soon became evident, though, that while good management was important, it was not sufficient in and of itself to turn around spiraling schools.</p>
        <p>''With the benefit of hindsight, there was far too much optimism about what managerial reform could accomplish,'' said Howard Fancy, a civil servant who was secretary of education under the National government and continues in that post in the Labor-led coalition government that was sworn in last December.</p>
        <p>The Ministry then initiated a School Improvement Project aimed at assisting struggling schools with substantial direct investment. A plan for Hilary College, a high school in Auckland, provided the equivalent of approximately $1 million for such purposes as buying out ''underperforming'' staff members, an anti-violence program, counseling services and new equipment. A similar plan for nearby Tangaroa College provided funds for staff buyouts, new equipment and support of a guidance clinic, a nurse, a truancy officer and a part-time sports coordinator.</p>
        <p>The new government has vowed to strengthen the School Improvement Project. Eighteen primary, intermediate and secondary schools in a low-income and immigrant section of Auckland have now formed a coalition to address common problems, and leaders say they plan to try new approaches.</p>
        <p>''We have to think long and hard about pedagogy,'' said Terry Bates, the director of a new project linking schools in Auckland.</p>
        <p>''The teaching methods that we developed after World War II are not suitable for inner-city kids who have all kinds of interruptions in their lives that do not hinder middle-class kids,'' he continued. ''We need to provide more one-on-one instruction. We need to find ways of using technology in ways that allow pupils to take greater control of their own learning.''</p>
        <p>The new government has taken other steps to address what it views as some of the excesses of the Tomorrow's Schools reforms. In an effort to rein in the ability of popular schools to cherry-pick easy-to-teach students, new legislation requires schools that have more applicants than they can handle to hold a lottery to determine who can enroll.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fancy, the education secretary, pointed out that while Tomorrow's Schools had exacerbated the problems of some urban schools, many of those schools were failing well before 1989. In highlighting the negative impact that a competitive environment had on troubled schools, he suggested, the reforms had the effect of drawing public attention to their needs.</p>
        <p>''Tomorrow's Schools has sharpened our focus on educational failure,'' he said. ''Only now, 10 years into the reforms, are we seeing a serious effort to turn schools around.''</p>
