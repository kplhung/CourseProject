        <p>OVER the years, I have seen Chekhov's plays performed on many stages -- in London, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Paris and throughout the United States. I have seen all the late great ''Cherry Orchards'': the Romanian-born Andrei Serban's silver-boughed one at Lincoln Center in 1977, Peter Brook's carpeted version at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 1988, Peter Stein's Wagnerian one (in German) at the Moscow Art Theater in 1993. Also, Oleg Yefremov's ''Three Sisters'' in Russian, at both the Moscow Art Theater in 1997 and at BAM in 1998, and every other Chekhov play he directed. To name only a few. I am a Chekhov translator, so it's an occupational hazard, as well as a passion. I have also directed the four major plays, several more than once.</p>
        <p>But there was something extraordinarily moving about seeing Chekhov performed earlier this summer on a tiny stage here. It was in Czech, of course, a language I understand minimally. Still, I wasn't prepared for its impact. I hadn't even planned to go. The last weekend of my six-week stay, Czech colleagues told me about an ''Uncle Vanya'' that I had to see at the Divadlo na Zabradli (Theater of the Balustrade), an independent (as in Off Broadway) theater not far from the building where I was teaching for New York University.</p>

        <p>OVER the years, I have seen Chekhov's plays performed on many stages -- in London, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Paris and throughout the United States. I have seen all the late great ''Cherry Orchards'': the Romanian-born Andrei Serban's silver-boughed one at Lincoln Center in 1977, Peter Brook's carpeted version at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 1988, Peter Stein's Wagnerian one (in German) at the Moscow Art Theater in 1993.

I am a Chekhov translator, so it's an occupational hazard, as well as a passion. I have also directed the four major plays, several more than once.</p>
        <p>But there was something extraordinarily moving about seeing Chekhov performed earlier this summer on a tiny stage here. It was in Czech, of course, a language I understand minimally. Still, I wasn't prepared for its impact. I hadn't even planned to go. The last weekend of my six-week stay, Czech colleagues told me about an ''Uncle Vanya'' that I had to see at the Divadlo na Zabradli (Theater of the Balustrade), an independent (as in Off Broadway) theater not far from the building where I was teaching for New York University.</p>
        <p>''Be sure to see it,'' they told me, ''before it closes this weekend. It's the hit of the season. You'll like it. Act III is set in Texas. And there is country-western music.''</p>
        <p>Now ordinarily that would be discouragement enough. Besides, I thought, hasn't there been enough of ''Uncle Vanya'' lately? What about the two recent productions in New York, one with Derek Jacobi and the other with Tom Courtenay, and Ian McKellen's in London in the mid-90's, plus the recent trio of Vanya films? Moreover, as a translator, I'm a purist and avoid productions that threaten to deconstruct a sacred text or tamper with the author's intent. (My students still haven't forgiven me for missing ''Brace Up!,'' the Wooster Group's deconstruction of ''The Three Sisters.'')</p>
        <p>But rather than disappoint my Czech friends, I found my way through the maze of narrow streets behind the Old Town Square to a tiny cobblestone courtyard. There stood the most charming of theaters. From the moment I walked into the lobby, I felt glad that I had come. What I didn't know was that I was about to have the most inspiring theatrical experience of my life.</p>
        <p>The crowded, airless theater was so narrow that members of the audience had to sidle down the aisle, shoulder first, squeezing between folding seats set up to accommodate the overflow. I had been given a balcony ticket, but never attempted to find the stairs. Feigning foreign ignorance, I slipped into the one remaining orchestra seat in the third row.</p>
        <p>And then the curtain went up, or, I should say, opened. The set was behind a rough-hewn wooden gate that swung out over the heads of the audience (we all ducked, literally), revealing the most exuberant, creative, vital and wildly imaginative production of ''Uncle Vanya'' that I had ever seen.</p>
        <p>Yes, it was unorthodox. There was the Nanny whose hair was dyed bright red and who spent the entire production playing soccer with four young men clad in rugby shirts and soccer shoes, as was the Nanny, too. (Who were those young men? It's a nine-character play. I should know, I translated it.)</p>
        <p>Then there was the Yelena, who sat in a swing -- as she is supposed to -- gently rocked by Vanya. Only the swing, made of wood, was shaped like a Viking boat and had ''The African Queen'' marked on its bow.</p>
        <p>And what about the crate of bananas that a character carried on during Act I, from which cast members helped themselves at provocative moments?</p>
        <p>Or the classic Sonya-Yelena nocturnal confidante scene at the end of Act II? In this production, the two actresses eventually stripped to their rose-colored undergarments, smoked cigarettes and munched on chicken cutlets; then the walls of the library flew away and the sleeping house was revealed, through which the pair of lovely, lost women wandered.</p>
        <p>Or the renowned map scene between Dr. Astrov and Yelena, which took place on a raked rooftop, with the lovers rolling over each other on their shingled bed, slipping and sliding precariously and hilariously.</p>
        <p>And then there were the remarkable musical choices: strains of piped-in Mozart (the Act II quartet from ''Cosi fan Tutte'') alternating with a live country-western ensemble (the soccer players, doubling as musicians) that broke into a spirited ''Yellow Rose of Texas'' when Vanya presented Yelena with her bouquet.</p>
        <p>Incomprehensible? Exhausting? Or worse, postmodern? Not at all. It was exhilarating. The audience filed into the lobby laughing and humming ''Beyond the Blue Horizon,'' the song that played under Sonya's final speech, those eternal Chekhov lines resounding over the country-western combo: ''We shall live, we shall live.'' And how.</p>
        <p>This ''Uncle Vanya,'' with its flamboyant flights of fancy and extravagant mixed metaphors, was closer in spirit to the original tragicomic intent of Chekhov than any interpretation I have seen. There was more laughter from this Chekhov audience than I have ever heard from others -- and more tears at the end, too.</p>
        <p>In the lobby, I thought about all the versions of the play I have been to and the artistic liberties taken. Wallace Shawn in ''Vanya on 42nd Street'' with his ''I Love NY'' coffee cup. Anthony Hopkins's Welsh Uncle Ieuan, in the movie ''August,'' reciting fragments of Chekhov's text from a sanitized screenplay.</p>
        <p>Then I thought of the ''Uncle Vanya'' I had just seen. Liberties? What liberties? The text has been preserved by the director. Why should he change it? Clearly, he reveres Chekhov. He is adorning the script, dressing it lovingly in an eccentric fashion, not to impress the audience but to celebrate Chekhov.</p>
        <p>Country music? Why not? ''Scenes From Country Life'' is the subtitle the author gave his play. Soccer? A bit of a stretch, and yet, they're bored. Nanny especially. Her life will never change. So why not have fun? It all makes Chekhovian sense. And it is faithful to what he has written. Which is, after all, tragicomedy.</p>
        <p>I take a seat in the lobby cafe with other excited audience members and actors chatting in half a dozen languages. A tall, lanky man in a buzz cut and caramel-colored jeans sits beside me. His name is Jiri Ornest, the actor who played Uncle Vanya. He is still in costume, looking as if he might have come straight from Wyoming. His sharp blue eyes flash as he talks to me in fluent English. ''We didn't agree on everything,'' he says, about the director, Petr Lebl, as if I know all about him. ''But we worked together. Free association.''</p>
        <p>''Where is the director?'' I ask. A young woman sits down next to me. She is the theater's dramaturge, Ivana Slamova, and she has been summoned by Uncle Vanya in response to my question. In a soft, low voice she explains that Petr Lebl is not with us tonight. For in December, the 35-year-old artist committed suicide by hanging himself from the rigging of the theater we had just been sitting in, only two months after his ''Uncle Vanya'' had opened. He suffered from depression. A pause, a silence.</p>
        <p>And then, slowly, the story unfolds. During Petr Lebl's charismatic six-year tenure as artistic director, the Theater of the Balustrade had regained its reputation (established in the 1960's, in that golden period when Vaclav Havel and other dissident writers made it their home) as the leading independent theater of Prague, producing dynamic seasons of new Czech work, the classics and adaptations.</p>
        <p>With his passion for Chekhov and his ''Seagull'' (1994) and ''Ivanov'' (1997) -- both of which won the prestigious Alfred Radok Award, named after a Czech director, for best production of the year -- Petr Lebl's reputation as the leading young visionary of Czech theater was established. His ''Cabaret'' also won prizes. His ''Cyrano'' toured internationally. His ''Ivanov'' was invited to the Moscow Art Theater.</p>
        <p>But despite the theater's success and his own recognition, there was always the depression. And with the mixed reviews of ''Uncle Vanya'' last fall -- from wildly ecstatic to damning what he considered his best work -- the depression deepened.</p>
        <p>Now, six months later, they still find it painful to talk about. ''Come back Sunday,'' Ivana says. ''It's the closing night of the season. We'll have more time.''</p>
        <p>And I do. And meet Petr Lebl's mother and sister and the company members who love him so much. Surrounded by the actors and their children and friends, there is a feeling of family -- theater family -- of warmth, of life.</p>
        <p>I am seated at the oval table in the cafe where Petr Lebl used to gather his cast. The actress sitting to my right, who played Vanya's mother, shakes her head, smiling. ''He can never be replaced,'' her husband translates for her into Russian. Petra Spalkova, who had played Sonya that night and looks just like the English actress Emily Watson, sits on my left. She points to another woman in the cafe: ''That's Olga Sommerova. Did you see her documentary about Petr on Czech national television a few nights ago?''</p>
        <p>I am dismayed that I missed it. She leaves for a moment and returns with a video copy. ''Take it,'' she says. ''Return it whenever you like.''</p>
        <p>AS I watch the film the next day, with the help of an interpreter, I realize that the story of Petr Lebl is still evolving. In the moving, hourlong program, the actors whom I had met the night before speak with pride and compassion about their beloved director as they struggle to understand and accept his choice.</p>
        <p>''The Amadeus of the Czech theater''; ''He left a space no one can fill''; ''I still can't believe it happened''; ''He's here, he's still here''; ''He loved the theater with all his heart''; ''I miss him, he was my nourishment''; ''He must have suffered so much''; ''We don't understand the darkness''; ''He had the right to do it''; ''I cried, but I'm not going to cry anymore.''</p>
        <p>Tall, solidly built, with a pony tail and a warm, open face, he had the sweetest of smiles. There are clips in which he talks of depression. They are chilling to watch in retrospect.</p>
        <p>''All my heroes kill themselves,'' he says, speaking of Chekhov's heroes Ivanov and Treplev (''The Seagull''). ''They don't mean it; they're just trying to solve their problems and this is the best they can do.''</p>
        <p>''What is your wish?'' an interviewer asks.</p>
        <p>''I'd like to parachute and still be alive, but I'm afraid I'd pull the strings improperly and embarrass myself. I want my jump to be elegant.''</p>
        <p>But that Sunday evening at the cafe there was no feeling of mourning. Members of Petr's company sat at the table, arms around each other, laughing and talking about the next season. The actor who played Astrov in ''Uncle Vanya'' confided, ''I'm playing Ivanov,'' and spoke with excitement of the theater's plan to remount Petr's ''Ivanov'' in the fall.</p>
        <p>So I left the cafe that night with sadness and elation -- a true Chekhovian mixture. A young artist had died tragically and yet his art is still alive, with all its power, humor and imagination. His art, which is making a vital contribution to the reviving Czech theater and inspiring a new generation of Czech artists. ''Beyond the Blue Horizon.'' Chekhov would have loved it.</p>
