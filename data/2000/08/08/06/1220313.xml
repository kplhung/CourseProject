        <p>I am an anesthesiologist. Last week, I had a young male patient on the table for an apendectomy. As I was pushing the drugs to put him to sleep, I noticed a Nazi flag tattoo enveloping his upper arm. Being Jewish and having a grandmother who lost her entire family to the Nazis, I was disturbed. What level of care must an ethical physician provide to a patient he finds offensive? -- Anonymous, Atlanta</p>
        <p>You must give every patient proficient treatment. That is your sworn obligation. It is not for you to judge your patients' worth as people.</p>

        <p>I am an anesthesiologist. Last week, I had a young male patient on the table for an apendectomy. As I was pushing the drugs to put him to sleep, I noticed a Nazi flag tattoo enveloping his upper arm. Being Jewish and having a grandmother who lost her entire family to the Nazis, I was disturbed. What level of care must an ethical physician provide to a patient he finds offensive? -- Anonymous, Atlanta</p>
        <p>You must give every patient proficient treatment. That is your sworn obligation. It is not for you to judge your patients' worth as people.</p>
        <p>You may find the tattoo an obvious emblem for the man, but it's not. In fact, you know little about him except that at some point in his life he got a tattoo expressing odious ideas; you have no idea what he thinks now or what bad behavior, if any, he has ever engaged in. You do know, on the other hand, that your patient is probably too young to have been an active Nazi in the war.</p>
        <p>Still, it is true that we all treat different people differently. Plumbers, shopkeepers and the late General Patton have been brusque with some people, solicitous with others. You, too, are entitled to human feelings. But you must always be thoroughly professional. If you can't do that, recuse yourself and let another anesthesiologist handle the patient.</p>
        <p>I will be starting college in a few months and wonder if I am obligated to tell my dorm mate that I'm a lesbian. Is it wrong to hide something that could be deemed significant, or may I keep my sexual orientation to myself? If I do tell her, can I at least wait until we know each other, so that she doesn't perceive it as my defining feature? -- H.H., Gainesville, Fla.</p>
        <p>Sharing a room with someone does not mean relinquishing all claims to privacy. You have no ethical obligation to discuss your sexual orientation with your dorm mate. And while it is certainly possible that someone may feel uneasy with a gay roommate or a Jewish roommate or a black roommate, that's his or her problem.</p>
        <p>Of course, sharing a room with someone makes her comfort your problem too, so your sense of tact is well placed. That is, if you decide to tell her, do it when you know each other well enough to feel at ease sharing so intimate a confidence. Unless you are planning to bring paramours back to the room your first week of school -- this sounds awfully optimistic to me, but perhaps my own freshman experience is not a reliable guide here -- there is no reason to hasten this conversation. And if you never feel like telling her, that's O.K., too.</p>
        <p>My garbage cans were stolen, contents and all, and dragged down the street to a waiting van, trash spilling behind them. Was it my responsibility to clean up the trash left on the street? I feel as if I, the victim, was being made to pay for the crime against me. -- Martin Golan, Montclair, N.J.</p>
        <p>You may not want to clean up, but if you don't, you'll be walking in garbage. (It is unlikely that the thief will return to tidy up.) Much of adult life entails responding to circumstances not of our making. For instance, you have to shovel your sidewalk even if you didn't seed the clouds or install the ski-resort machinery that dumped a blanket of snow on it. This civic duty comes with the house -- and in many cities is also a legal obligation. But the real question is this: Why is someone stealing cans of garbage? Have our nation's thieves completely lost their way?</p>
