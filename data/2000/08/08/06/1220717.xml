        <p>With a heartbreaking 24 hours behind him and another harrowing 24 ahead, Todd Pletcher summoned a comfortable truism he learned as a boy from his father, J. J., as they knocked along the back stretches of the Southwestern racing circuit.

        <p>With a heartbreaking 24 hours behind him and another harrowing 24 ahead, Todd Pletcher summoned a comfortable truism he learned as a boy from his father, J. J., as they knocked along the back stretches of the Southwestern racing circuit. One of three talented 3-year-olds in his barn, Graeme Hall, had just galloped home a surprise winner in the Jim Dandy, earning a relieved shake of the head from Pletcher, his 33-year-old trainer.</p>
        <p>''You eat chicken one day, feathers the next,'' he said. ''It's just the way this game is. You have to enjoy the chicken when you have it.''</p>
        <p>The trophy from the Grade II race represented the chicken he could enjoy, the $240,000 first-place check could provide some healthy feed for Graeme Hall's owners, Eugene and Laura Melnyk, and the victory in this prep for the Travers Stakes catapulted Pletcher to the top of the trainers' standing here at Saratoga Race Course.</p>
        <p>On Friday, however, Pletcher's prospects were not nearly as promising. His blazing sprinter, Trippi, was anything but in finishing third as the odds-on favorite in the Amsterdam. A bruise discovered on his left hoof explained part of the problem.</p>
        <p>As Graeme Hall was preparing to run the best race of his young career, Pletcher received more bad news. The jockey John Velazquez, who was supposed to fly to the Jersey Shore and ride More Than Ready, the morning-line favorite, for Pletcher in Sunday's $1 million Haskell Invitational at Monmouth Park, was involved in a nasty spill in today's fifth race and might have broken his left collarbone.</p>
        <p>That tension was suspended for a startling 1:48.95 -- the time it took Graeme Hall to dash 1 1/8 miles and ruin the coronation of the front-running Albert the Great -- as the slightly built son of Dehere showed his victory in the Arkansas Derby was not a fluke before an enthusiastic crowd of 64,979. Under Jerry Bailey, Graeme Hall sat on the wing of the Nick Zito-trained Albert the Great as the two clicked off a swift half-mile fraction of 46.11 seconds.</p>
        <p>''We're going too fast,'' Pletcher suspected from his perch in the owner's box.</p>
        <p>Bailey was unruffled and believed he was just following the trainer's instructions. ''He told me to let him find his rhythm,'' Bailey said. ''My horse was real aggressive around the turn. I could have put Albert the Great away any time.''</p>
        <p>By the time Bailey and Graeme Hall hit the top of the stretch, they had, stopping Albert the Great's four-race winning streak and leaving Zito sputtering for a reason. ''I'm at a loss for words,'' Zito said. ''I have no excuse. I thought we were just going to gallop out to the lead and make the move, but we didn't. He cleared to the lead, and the next thing I knew, he stopped.''</p>
        <p>Much as he did in the Arkansas Derby, Graeme Hall continued to dig down the middle of the lane, determined to hold off the late runners, Curule and Unshaded. That pair loped along in sixth and seventh place until getting interested at the bottom of the final turn.</p>
        <p>''I was stuck going into the final turn,'' said the rider of second-place Curule, Mike Smith, a last-minute replacement for Velazquez. ''He's not like a horse you ride every day. He's got a quick trigger. Now I know.''</p>
        <p>Carl Nafzger, the trainer for the 2-1 favorite, Unshaded, took responsibility for his gelding's uneven race, but with a qualifier. The trainer had said all along that his goal was to win the Aug. 26 Travers Stakes.</p>
        <p>''Maybe I should have had him a little sharper,'' he said. ''This wasn't our main goal.''</p>
        <p>Like Nafzger's, Pletcher's sights are on winning the Travers and making a case for one of his talented colts to be named 3-year-old of the year. Besides More Than Ready, who will be ridden by Richard Migliore on Sunday at Monmouth, the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness's third-place finisher, Impeachment, will represent his barn in the big race in Oceanport, N.J.</p>
        <p>With the racing future of the Kentucky Derby winner Fusaichi Pegasus clouded by an impending sale as a stallion and the Preakness winner Red Bullet still recovering from a viral infection and ulcers, the 3-year-old division is wide open. There was no mistaking that one of Pletcher's horses had earned his way into the Travers.</p>
        <p>Asked if he would run, the trainer responded: ''That's why we're here.''</p>
        <p>If More Than Ready and Impeachment run well on Sunday, Graeme Hall will have plenty of company.</p>
        <p>FINISH LINES</p>
        <p>Horse racing lost one of its international stars when Godolphin Racing announced Saturday that Dubai Millennium sustained a lateral condylar fracture of his right hind and will be retired to stud. The prize runner of Sheik MOHAMMED BIN RASHID AL-MAKTOUM apparently injured himself while working out at Newmarket in England. The 4-year-old son of Seeking the Gold won the Dubai World Cup and looked invincible in an eight-length victory in the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot.</p>
