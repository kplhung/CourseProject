        <p>LAST year was a great year for Latin music, and by extension Latin culture, in the United States, if one accepts that the enthusiastic reception of Latin music by non-Latinos was a true indication of the music's health. What happened, in fact, was that some of Latin music's most popular artists -- Ricky Martin in Latin pop and Marc Anthony in salsa -- made records in English that were huge sellers in the United States. As might be expected, the English-speaking press took notice.</p>
        <p>The attendant articles and discussions promoted the idea of a flowering of Latin culture. The news media were discovering what had long been obvious to marketers, advertisers and venture capitalists: the Spanish-speaking population in the United States was growing and asserting itself culturally through its buying habits.</p>
        <p>Optimists saw a rosy, multicultural future, in which the Anglo majority gave up some cultural room to the Hispanic minority, slapping them on the back and inviting them over to dinner. Meanwhile, pessimists grumbled and waited. In their view, Latin music in the United States was in big trouble, facing internal and external conflicts that were largely ignored by the commentators. And now, a year later, the fault lines have grown wider. As the pessimists predicted, the non-Hispanic media have lost interest in the story, and Latin music in the United States continues its tumble toward a state of crisis.</p>
        <p>Salsa, the dance music from Puerto Rico and New York, offers a case in point. It is virtually dead both in terms of sales and the paucity of promising new artists. Where Marc Anthony, at the peak of his success three years ago, sold 400,000 copies of his album ''Contra la Corriente,'' the newest pretender to his throne, George Lamond, sold 41,000 copies of his album ''Entrega'' last year, putting him in the league of a good-selling jazz artist. (By comparison, Keith Jarrett's solo piano record ''The Melody at Night, With You'' was a hit last year, selling 84,000 copies.)</p>
        <p>Latin record distributors along 10th Avenue in Manhattan are clamoring for new records to push to stores -- and not finding any. What is showing up, from labels large and small, is dreadful, badly produced and profoundly out of step with the times. To appeal to young consumers, salsa, like all pop music, must reflect their concerns. But there are few salsa singers under 30, and none showing much more than modest promise.</p>
        <p>It isn't the artists' fault. The problems are systemic. In New York, where there had been hundreds of clubs in the 1960's and 1970's, places where artists could learn how to play and the art of dominating a room, there are now only a handful. Much the same thing is happening in Puerto Rico. And salsa record companies are a generation or two behind the time, selling salsa's elders, dressed in coat and tie, to teenagers who are just as much a product of hip-hop as they are of classic salsa. In a grave misstep, record companies have stifled innovation in salsa, and as a result the music has suffered.</p>
        <p>Radio, once the music's lifeblood, has become a major part of the problem, sticking to imitations of years-old hits and ignoring new, youth-oriented trends, most notably timba, the dance music coming out of Cuba. Mega (WSKQ, 97.9 FM), the tropical station in New York, which was in the No. 2 spot last fall, fell to No. 6 this spring, according to the latest Arbitron ratings. Its programming has become lackluster, the music has grown stale and, unsurprisingly, listeners have tuned out.</p>
        <p>What's happening in salsa is symptomatic of the difficulties facing all Latin music in the United States, and the reasons are many. Latin teenagers flex their bicultural muscles, moving through all the musical genres available on the radio and among their peers. It's entirely possible for a Latin teenager in New York to listen to the rapper Jay-Z one minute, the rock group Matchbox 20 the next and the reggae singer Sean Paul a moment later. All of it is well-made pop, tailored to the dance floor. It sounds good, translates well to radio and is on the receiving end of lots of promotional money from record companies, much of it aimed at the teenage market. Teenagers are buying the comfort of mass success.</p>
        <p>Venture capitalists, advertisers and marketers are now hedging their bets, revising investments in the Latin market on the assumption that assimilation may rob the market of its uniform buying power. Experience has shown them that the influence of national loyalty lasts one generation, then shows up only occasionally thereafter. Latin teenagers act just like any other American teenagers, voting their aesthetic preference every time they buy music or turn on the radio.</p>
        <p>IT is possible for salsa, and Latin pop more generally, to be a part of teenagers' listening habits, but it has to meet their definition of hipness (which more than ever means blackness), danceability and both songwriting and technological sophistication. In its current state, it comes with none of these elements. When two second-generation New York Spanish-speaking teenagers were asked to name the top three salsa stars a few weeks ago, they shrugged and said: ''There aren't any. Maybe D.L.G.'' -- a reference to Dark Latin Groove, a salsa group with an urban sound.</p>
        <p>But something else profound is happening in the world of Latin music: it's exploding with creativity, with uncountable genres mutating and spawning across the Americas, virtually none of which have had commercial success in the United States. Mainstream Latin music companies are pinning their hopes on an astoundingly narrow group of artists, mostly pop crooners and smooth salsa singers. This isn't to argue that pop music from elsewhere in the world has produced an abundance of personalities, but Latin pop simply hasn't kept pace.</p>
        <p>Without question, an audience for different forms of Latin music exists in the United States, and it needs cultivation. Unlike the United States, many of the countries of Latin America, until recently, never developed an audience large enough to sustain the kind of intelligent experimentalism now taking place in Latin pop under the rubric of rock en espanol. But Latin music has failed to develop an infrastructure to support anything but the most obvious music like classic salsa. The success of Latin pop, for example, depends, like much of popular culture in Latin countries, on its relationship to telenovelas, the Spanish- and Portuguese-language soap operas that promote glamour and escapism. An alternative rocker doesn't stand much of a chance of using that medium, nor does a salsa singer, especially one with dark skin.</p>
        <p>Radio could help, but it hasn't. Rock en espanol, which over the last several years has produced a slew of exceptional albums aimed at a sophisticated, young audience, doesn't get played on Latin radio, and the few commercial radio stations in the United States that do, only do so occasionally. Without radio airplay, disseminating the music is almost impossible. Worse, the Latin major labels are run by people whose strengths are in marketing pop or tropical music, and they don't really know how to market music outside those genres. Consider ''Caribe Atomico,'' a 1998 album by the Colombian group Aterciopelados that is a beautiful experimental rock record and one of the genre's best. It was released by the Latin affiliate of a major American label and sold just under 10,000 copies in the United States. Notwithstanding such failures, bands and record labels are looking for ways to break with past practice: the next albums by Titan, an experimental hip-hop and pop hybrid from Mexico, and Manu Chao, a French and Spanish group, will be released through the non-Latino side of Virgin Records and treated as priorities.</p>
        <p>So as the second generation of Latins in the United States continues to grow and develop more sophisticated tastes, the appetite for less mainstream music is likely to expand beyond artists in the Ricky Martin or Marc Anthony mold. Shows by bands from Cuba in the United States used to draw predominantly Cuban audiences; now they attract fans from across Latin America, along with others looking for new rhythms to dance to. Ditto for performances by rock en espanol bands. A recent show at Mercury Lounge in Manhattan by the band Sergeant Garcia drew listeners from France, Cuba, Puerto Rico and elsewhere.</p>
        <p>This is the music of the future, with audiences that can be cultivated. While the cracks in the Latin music industry are getting bigger, there are encouraging signs for the music's eventual viability in the United States. Yet the question remains: can an audience be found for it? If not, the marketplace will decide and listeners will simply go elsewhere, exercising their right to exist in several cultures at the same time, and derailing, at least in the United States, the possibility of a real surge in creativity.</p>
