        <p>For young people in Hastings-on-Hudson, it is a dream come true: their own skateboard park. Last month the Village Board voted to replace a basketball court in Riverview Park with the first skateboarding course in southern Westchester.</p>

        <p>For young people in Hastings-on-Hudson, it is a dream come true: their own skateboard park. Last month the Village Board voted to replace a basketball court in Riverview Park with the first skateboarding course in southern Westchester.</p>
        <p>''We'd been looking for the last couple of years for a location that would be a safe alternative,'' Village Manager Neil P. Hess said. Officials have often voiced concern about the risks of skateboarding in front of the Hastings Middle School and on local streets.</p>
        <p>Skateboarders lobbied for the park, and sixth graders signed petitions for it, Bill Finkleday, the village's youth manager, said. One of them attended the Village Board meeting but forgot to bring the petitions.</p>
        <p>The park, which will roughly be 50 by 80 feet and cost about $25,000, should be completed in the fall, Mr. Hess said.</p>
        <p>It will be limited to Hastings residents and will be policed by a supervisor, probably an older teenager, Mr. Hess said. Safety equipment, including helmets, wrist pads and knee pads, will be required.</p>
