      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Many readers responded to Peter Applebome's July 23 Soapbox column about racial mores and suburban manners at a gas station in Westchester County. The problem the column posed was what, if anything, to say to or do about the black gentleman sharing his expletive-laden music with the world and also Mr. Applebome's 9-year-old daughter.</p>
        <p>Here is a sampling of readers' reactions.</p>
        <p>Our family enjoyed discussing your dilemma and we came to a consensus that all people should strive to meet new people in new situations. Then we can all learn that people, regardless of race, will offer individual responses.</p>

        <p>Many readers responded to Peter Applebome's July 23 Soapbox column about racial mores and suburban manners at a gas station in Westchester County. The problem the column posed was what, if anything, to say to or do about the black gentleman sharing his expletive-laden music with the world and also Mr. Applebome's 9-year-old daughter.</p>
        <p>Here is a sampling of readers' reactions.</p>
        <p>Our family enjoyed discussing your dilemma and we came to a consensus that all people should strive to meet new people in new situations. Then we can all learn that people, regardless of race, will offer individual responses.</p>
        <p>My husband admits that his prejudice in the situation you describe is that he anticipates anyone who plays loud music, from white teen to black adult, will ignore any request or offer an angry response. He would ignore anyone playing the loud music.</p>
        <p>My 13-year-old son notes that most black parents whom he has met would be just as upset as you were about the profane lyrics.</p>
        <p>I am a strong advocate of free speech and hesitate to criticize another person's form of art. However, the mother in me might offer a gentle reminder to either the black adult or the white teen about the damage he is causing to his ears.</p>
        <p>Finally, let us offer you a warning. If your daughter attends all-white schools, then she has probably heard much worse than the lyrics to a rap song. My son has sat in classrooms where he is the only white child, and he has attended camps in shoreline Connecticut where there are no black children, and he assures us that he has heard far more bigoted, cruel and ignorant comments in the latter location.</p>
