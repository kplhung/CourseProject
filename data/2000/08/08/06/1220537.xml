        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The writer of an Aug. 2 letter about ''Tales of Raw Misery for Ages 12 and Up'' (Week in Review, July 30) talked about her fourth-grade daughter. The writer said, ''In her classes she was treated to stories of children ripped from poor families, girls hounded for being suspected as witches, girls sent to live with intolerant relatives, girls who were bullied or excluded, and families without mothers, fathers or money.''</p>
