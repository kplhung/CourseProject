        <p>Article, in light of upcoming performance at Ives Concert Park in Danbury, Conn, on favorite Motown groups, including The Temptations and Martha Reeves and the Vandellas, which, for variety of reasons including deaths and firings, use different performers to fill vacant spots; photo (M)</p>

        <p>FANS of oldies music have learned by now to read the fine print of advertisements before seeing their favorite groups in concert. In many cases, the people they see on stage are not the same ones who recorded the groups' hit singles. Three years ago, after the Four Tops performed live on a morning television show in London, a woman called the station to dispute the group's identity.</p>
        <p>''She called to say we couldn't be the Four Tops because she just saw them in Spain,'' said Abdul (Duke) Fakir -- one of the real Four Tops -- with a laugh.</p>

        <p>FANS of oldies music have learned by now to read the fine print of advertisements before seeing their favorite groups in concert. In many cases, the people they see on stage are not the same ones who recorded the groups' hit singles. Three years ago, after the Four Tops performed live on a morning television show in London, a woman called the station to dispute the group's identity.</p>
        <p>''She called to say we couldn't be the Four Tops because she just saw them in Spain,'' said Abdul (Duke) Fakir -- one of the real Four Tops -- with a laugh.</p>
        <p>''I've seen it a lot,'' said the baritone Otis Williams, the Temptations' sole original member, who will perform on Friday night at the Ives Concert Park in Danbury with Martha Reeves and the Vandellas as well as the Marvelettes and the Sentinels. ''I've performed with a couple different groups of the Marvelettes, the Platters,'' Mr. Williams said. ''It's misleading to the public.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Reeves, best known for such hit songs as ''Heat Wave'' and ''Dancing in the Streets,'' said there was no confusion about her identity. ''I'm the only Martha Reeves, the only one they hear singing. There are no full-time Vandellas, only part time. I see who's available and decide who to take with me.''</p>
        <p>Because bands such as the Temptations and have been around for 40 years, some personnel changes are expected. Along the way, people die, quit or get fired. The Temptations -- known for the hit songs ''It's The Same Old Song,'' ''Reach Out, I'll Be There'' and ''Standing In The Shadows Of Love'' -- originally consisted of Mr. Williams, Melvin Franklin, Eldridge Bryant (replaced by David Ruffin in the early 60's), Eddie Kendricks and Paul Williams. Before signing on with Motown Records in 1960, the group where called the Elgins, then the Primes. Ruffin left the group in 1968 for a solo career, only to return in 1981. Paul Williams died in 1973, Ruffin in 1991, Kendricks in 1992 and Franklin in 1995.</p>
        <p>Today Otis Williams surrounds himself with Ron Tyson, Terry Weeks, Harry McGillberry and Barrignton Henderson. This is the same lineup that recorded last year's successful album, ''The Temptations Phoenix Rising.''</p>
        <p>''These guys remind me of the original lineup we had in the early 60's,'' Mr. Williams said. ''Same energy and cohesiveness.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Reeves uses two backup singers from a pool of about six, including two of her sisters, as her Vandellas. When she started singing for Berry Gordy at Motown, she was the record label's secretary. ''It was all in Berry's house, and it was like a family,'' she said. ''Berry picked 18 groups from the Detroit club scene that he thought could make it, and he worked with each of us very closely. Back then, I knew nothing about the business. I had to acquire that knowledge over the years.''</p>
        <p>By the 80's, Mr. Gordy reverted the rights to Martha Reeves and the Vandellas to Ms. Reeves. Since then she has held close reins over the music. In the case of her big hits (''Nowhere to Run,'' ''Dancing in the Streets'' and ''Heat Wave,'' all of which have been licensed to successful movies and commercials), she has made a handsome profit from the rights.</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams said that Mr. Gordy gave him the rights to the Temptations' name in 1975. As licensee of his group's name, Mr. Williams has done his best to nip any pirating in the bud.</p>
        <p>''It's hard to police everywhere,'' he said. ''I know that a Temptations group surfaced in Australia. There was little we could do about that.''</p>
        <p>Like Ms. Reeves, Mr. Williams started out in a rough business rather naive. Now he thanks his good sense to attain the Temptations' exclusive rights 25 years ago. ''Every day I think of that decision and thank my good fortune,'' he said, ''every day.''</p>
        <p>The Temptations, Martha Reeves and the Vandellas, the Marvelettes and the Sentinels will perform at 7:30 p.m. Friday at Ives Concert Park, Western Connecticut State University's Mid-Town Campus, Mill Plain Road, Danbury. Tickets for reserved seating are $10 to $50. The numbers to call for further information are (203) 744-8100 or (203) 624-0033.</p>
        <p>MUSIC  Correction:  August 13, 2000, Sunday  An article last Sunday about Motown acts appearing in Danbury misidentified the group that recorded the three hits ''It's the Same Old Song,'' ''Reach Out, I'll Be There'' and ''Standing in the Shadows of Love.'' It was the Four Tops, not the Temptations.</p>
