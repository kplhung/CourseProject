        <p>If there is anyone who understands the difficulty of following a legend, it is the quarterback Steve Young. In the early 1990's, Young and Joe Montana were in a heated battle for the starting job in San Francisco. Montana was struggling to overcome injuries and refused to be a backup. He eventually finished his career in Kansas City, and just last weekend was inducted into the Hall of Fame. Young went on to win a Super Bowl with the 49ers and will also someday be inducted.</p>
        <p>But on his way out the door, Montana made it known that he and Young were not friends. ''Steve is on a big push for himself,'' Montana said in a 1991 interview. ''And any time you have a competition, there is always that certain amount of animosity towards each other. I can say we only have a working relationship. That's all it is. After that, he's on my team, but as far as I'm concerned, he's part of the opposition. He wants what I have, and I have to approach it that way. There is no other way to deal with it.''</p>

        <p>If there is anyone who understands the difficulty of following a legend, it is the quarterback Steve Young. In the early 1990's, Young and Joe Montana were in a heated battle for the starting job in San Francisco. Montana was struggling to overcome injuries and refused to be a backup. He eventually finished his career in Kansas City, and just last weekend was inducted into the Hall of Fame. Young went on to win a Super Bowl with the 49ers and will also someday be inducted.</p>
        <p>But on his way out the door, Montana made it known that he and Young were not friends. ''Steve is on a big push for himself,'' Montana said in a 1991 interview. ''And any time you have a competition, there is always that certain amount of animosity towards each other. I can say we only have a working relationship. That's all it is. After that, he's on my team, but as far as I'm concerned, he's part of the opposition. He wants what I have, and I have to approach it that way. There is no other way to deal with it.''</p>
        <p>At the time, Young vowed that if he was ever in a situation where a younger player was behind him, he would not treat that player the way Montana treated him. A decade later, Young got the chance to make good on those words, but if you believe the current 49ers quarterback, Jeff Garcia, Young failed.</p>
        <p>The quarterback soap operas in San Francisco have been legendary, and while what happened between Garcia and Young may not make the top five, it is still interesting. And around the league, both now and historically, relationships between a starting quarterback and his backup can often be tense.</p>
        <p>Garcia said this week that he wishes Young, who retired during the off-season, had been more supportive last year. Young was the only returning quarterback, and behind him were Garcia and Steve Stenstrom. When Young sustained a season-ending concussion in Week 3, Garcia became the starter. Garcia said that at that point, Young's attitude became quite chilly.</p>
        <p>''I'm sure not being in the role he was normally used to being in, as far as being the starting quarterback and the guy everybody else can count on, that really changed his mind-set,'' Garcia said. ''In doing so, I didn't really feel there was a whole lot of activity from him in helping us young guys. He was dealing with his own thing, so he kept to himself in that way.''</p>
        <p>Garcia understands part of why Young was distant. It was a difficult time for Young who, because of a series of concussions, faced the end of his career. Those times are always the most difficult, and they can wreck a player's emotions, turning someone as classy and friendly as Young into more of a loner.</p>
        <p>''Other than questioning during games, asking him what we could do to hopefully have some success on the field, other than that, it didn't seem like -- I don't know -- that's sort of a difficult area to describe,'' Garcia said. ''I think everybody's going to approach those situations the best way they know. If I'm in those shoes, I approach it differently.''</p>
        <p>''When I looked at his situation last year and realizing that it got to the point he wasn't going to be back as a player,'' Garcia said, ''I would have liked to have seen more of the coach come out in him. Especially when dealing with new guys on the team.''</p>
        <p>So Young's personal soap opera had come full circle. He survived Montana's jabs, only to act not exactly personable years later, Garcia said, when injuries were forcing him to contemplate his mortality as a player.</p>
        <p>Garcia's words caused a stir in 49ersville, and prompted a meeting between Garcia and Coach Steve Mariucci, who chastised Garcia for chastising a team legend. After the meeting, Garcia was complimentary of Young. That is called damage control.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Garcia should prepare for what could be a long season. The 49ers are a wreck, the victims of manipulating the salary cap for far too long. They have little talent and even less depth.</p>
        <p>''Maybe we'll surprise some people,'' Garcia said. ''That's the attitude I'm taking.''</p>
        <p>Rhodes Finds a Supporter</p>
        <p>When Ray Rhodes was fired as coach of the Green Bay Packers after last season, one of the people who remained a big fan was the Washington owner, Daniel Snyder. He brought Rhodes to the Redskins, made him the defensive coordinator and thinks Rhodes will soon become a head coach again.</p>
        <p>''I want Ray to take advantage of what I think is a great opportunity here,'' Snyder said. ''I think ultimately Ray will be one of the great head coaches in football. I really believe that.''</p>
        <p>Rhodes has been fired twice in the past 20 months, in Green Bay and before that in Philadelphia. Yet there has never been a question about his skills as a coordinator. He remains perhaps the best defensive mind in the game. Now, Rhodes is trying to turn around a defense that was ranked 30th last year and nearly mutinied under Mike Nolan, now the defensive coordinator with the Jets.</p>
        <p>One of the first things Rhodes did was change the scheme, which asked linemen to hold up blockers, while the linebackers made the play.</p>
        <p>''This defense allows everyone -- not just the defensive line -- but everyone to be a little more free and allow our football skills to take over,'' said Dan Wilkinson, a defensive lineman.</p>
        <p>''It was frustration across the board last year, because were asked to do things that we didn't think made too much sense.''</p>
        <p>Better Role Models</p>
        <p>Professional football players have made a lot of off-field news recently, much of it negative. They have been arrested on charges of everything from driving while intoxicated to murder.</p>
        <p>But there are players in the game who do positive things. Tampa Bay linebacker Derrick Brooks, for example, took 19 disadvantaged teenagers from the Tampa and Orlando Boys &amp; Girls Clubs on a 12-day trip to South Africa as a reward for good grades.</p>
        <p>Indianapolis Colts running back Edgerrin James donated $250,000 to his alma mater, the University of Miami. Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb is giving $100,000 to Syracuse University, his alma mater, for a new locker room in the school's football complex. In addition to his gift to Syracuse, McNabb is also financing scholarships at his former high school and a business loan program through his hometown church.</p>
        <p>And Tennessee's Eddie George, who recently signed one of the largest contracts ever for a running back, took 20 credits this spring at Ohio State University toward the completion of his undergraduate degree.</p>
