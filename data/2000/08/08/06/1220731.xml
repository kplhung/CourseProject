        <p>International efforts to end the diamond-driven civil war in Sierra Leone, where rebels have wrecked the country and mutilated thousands of civilians, are being thwarted by the president of neighboring Liberia, American and British diplomats said at a United Nations hearing.</p>
        <p>The Liberian president, Charles Taylor, has taken command of the rebels' fight against government troops and international peacekeepers, the diplomats said, adding that  Mr. Taylor meets regularly for strategy sessions with rebel officers, while personally profiting from trading arms, ammunition and food for smuggled diamonds. The Liberian government denied the charges.</p>
