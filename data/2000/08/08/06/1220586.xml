        <p>Most young people would scoff at the thought of anyone over 25 years old being considered hip. But Neil Young, at 54, is embraced by a whole generation of young music lovers who consider him ''The Godfather of Grunge.''</p>
        <p>The best part of Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, his music ranges from raging rock-guitar distortion to plaintive acoustic piano playing.</p>
        <p>When he comes to the Blockbuster Sony Entertainment Center in Camden at 8 p.m. Wednesday and the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel at 8 p.m. Aug. 19, he will be performing mostly from his new ''Silver and Gold'' album, a sometimes sappy, always eloquent, simply-crafted recording that sounds like a stripped-down ''Harvest.''</p>
        <p>Count on him performing totally engrossing sonic revelations from the past as well.</p>
