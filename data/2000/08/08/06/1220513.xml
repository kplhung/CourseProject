        <p>THE eye-watering fumes of fresh paint waft into the office in a former airport hangar, where Zofia Kargul-Smalewska, president of Gielda C.D., a small exhibitions company, is organizing the annual auto show this summer in this small city in western Poland. She expects 10,000 people to show up for the three-day event, kicking the tires of new and used cars and watching drag races and motorcycle demonstrations on a former Soviet air force base that was decommissioned after the cold war.</p>
        <p>There is no comparable building in Legnica, said Mrs. Kargul-Smalewska, who has helped turn the base into a makeshift industrial park. ''The Russians have been good for my business,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kargul-Smalewska is among thousands of Poles who, with government aid, have worked to beat Soviet swords into shares of post-Communist prosperity, an opportunity they have grabbed with both hands. The Russians left behind scores of military installations around the country, and at many of them factories, apartments and even resorts are rising or are being planned -- although some of these plans do not yet amount to much. Most of the investors so far are Poles, including several former redevelopment officials; no one has tracked the totals.</p>
        <p>Ten years ago, the 108,000 inhabitants of Legnica (pronounced leg-NEE-tsa) had a very different view of the Russians, and there was not much fresh paint to be smelled in the cavernous hangar. The occupying Soviet Army's Northern Group of Forces used the town, which was once German, and its garrison buildings from the 1930's as their Polish headquarters. The occupying forces  were despised by the locals.</p>
        <p>The Soviets invested billions of rubles building roads, an airport, barracks, bunkers and fuel dumps for their army. War never arrived, but when the Russians pulled out of Poland, Hungary and what had been Czechoslovakia in mid-1993, they took with them every sewage pump, electrical wire, door frame and window pane.</p>
        <p>What they left behind across the region resembled battlefields. But it was also a unique opportunity. Mrs. Kargul-Smalewska, in fact, was one of the economic development officials in charge of finding a new use for the abandoned airport before she decided to form her own company and use the base for trade fairs and other purposes.</p>
        <p>Getting started was a struggle, she said. First, the Polish army had to remove the mines seeded around the airfield. Then experts had to clean up the fuel spills and industrial wastes. Because the Soviets even took the maps of the water and electric lines, it was simpler to put in new ones. ''It looked like a typhoon had been through here,'' she said. ''Only the sewer lines were still good.''</p>
        <p>TODAY, crop dusters and private planes occasionally use the runway. The hangars alongside the tarmac house a supermarket, a hardware and building supply store and a string of apparently successful small businesses.</p>
        <p>Last October, Ryszard Kliszewski moved his small workshop, which makes burglar-proof steel doors,  from the city center to a former Russian electric transformer station near the airstrip. The Russians left only a roof and four walls. He invested about $10,000, he said, and business is up 30 percent. He has increased his work force from four to six men.</p>
        <p>''You add a door here, a window there and you have a building,'' he said. ''It's a good location. All the big companies are around you and because of the exhibitions next door, lots of people see you.''</p>
        <p>Some abandoned airfields find less exalted uses. In Kluczewo in northwest Poland, Franciscus Nouwen, a Dutch farmer and one of the few foreign investors, raises potatoes along the abandoned runway, storing his crop in the bunkers that hid Soviet warplanes from NATO.</p>
        <p>In Legnica itself, the Soviets occupied an entire district of the city -- called Tarninow -- that before World War II was home to the mercantile upper crust. Gates and armed patrols kept most Poles out of the quarter, which had its own shops and services for the Soviets. Nearly everything the Soviets occupied was left damaged or destroyed, but much has been rebuilt.</p>
        <p>''We didn't have any choice,'' said Stanislaw Kasprowiak, who runs the Legnica city office charged with reviving the formerly Soviet areas that were handed back to the Polish authorities. ''We had to reconstruct these bases. Otherwise our city would be half dead.''</p>
        <p>The fall of Communism in 1989 and the ensuing economic shock therapy brought Poland hyperinflation and 20 percent unemployment, from which it is still recovering. Legnica had almost no cash to put into redevelopment, but investors were attracted by ads in local newspapers and, later, a Web site (www.celarf.gov.pl) and speeches that public officials gave around the region. ''The goal was for people with money to come here and take over the properties, and basically it worked in Legnica,'' Mr. Kasprowiak said. More than 92 percent of the property once occupied by the Russians in the town has found new owners.</p>
        <p>Bogdan Wyznikiewicz, an economist who is deputy director of the Gdansk Institute for Market Economics, said Poles have been able to capitalize quickly on the Russian withdrawal. ''This entrepreneurship is something in the national character,'' Mr. Wyznikiewicz said.</p>
        <p>Investors and economists say that spirit is an important factor in Poland's booming economy, which is expected to grow 5 percent this year. The country is also bursting with start-up companies and high-technology ventures.</p>
        <p>While entrepreneurs are making the most of the old bases, it was only through government-run programs that the bases were sold. Western governments provided no money and just a few training programs for Polish officials trying to build capitalism on these Communist ashes. But national and local officials provided tax breaks, advice and inspiration.</p>
        <p>Last year, the city of Legnica finished rebuilding two of the Soviets'  rickety prefabricated concrete apartment blocks as a demonstration of the gold that could be found amidst the Soviet dross. The refurbished buildings were so attractive that the apartments were rented within weeks, and now developers are rebuilding the remainder of the apartments for sale.</p>
        <p>Most of the buyers and investors were from the area. The city offered easy terms, and Mr. Kasprowiak said most borrowers were making their mortgage payments on time. He estimated that while the city has taken in only about $7.5 million from selling 497 buildings, 10 to 15 times as  much was privately invested in rebuilding the old installations, and 600 to 700 new jobs were created, increasing tax revenue.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere, the Polish government has used the changes as an opportunity to encourage people to settle in certain areas. In Borne Sulinowo, a northern village that once housed Soviet intelligence officers, some 5,000 migrants were recruited; most of them were from Warsaw and the Silesian coal basin and fed up with high prices and polluted air.</p>
        <p>A local entrepreneur was lured in to build a furniture factory that now employs more than 400 people. New government jobs for doctors, teachers and public administrators helped to draw in others. So did the prices. ''We were selling apartments for an eighth or a tenth the price of places in Warsaw,'' said Maria Czerwinska, who heads the Polish government agency overseeing the sale of the bases.</p>
        <p>But not all the reconstruction stories have turned out so well. Warsaw city officials had high hopes for one abandoned airfield near the city center after the singer Michael Jackson signed a letter of intent in 1997 to build a $500 million theme park there. On a visit to Poland, he told local journalists that he had fallen in love with the nation.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Jackson's project has yet to materialize, and the Warsaw mayor canceled a scheduled news conference in March as negotiations stalled. Mr. Jackson said in a statement then that he remains interested.</p>
        <p>But even as the sale of former military property winds down, other opportunities remain. ''There's an airport on the Baltic Coast,'' Ms. Czerwinska said. ''A beautiful space for a golf course or a luxury hotel.''</p>
