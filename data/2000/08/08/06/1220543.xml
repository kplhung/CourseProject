        <p>Would it be a wheelchair-friendly doorway or a scar on a historic building? That is the question before the Landmarks Preservation Commission, which is considering a proposal to alter the entrance to the first apartment building in the Carnegie Hill Historic District.</p>
        <p>The St. David's School, a private Catholic school for boys, wants to move its main entrance several doors east to the Graham House, a Romanesque building it owns at 18-22 East 89th Street, at Madison Avenue. As part of the restructuring, the school wants to rip out the building's four-step stoop and lower the doorway to street level, in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.</p>
        <p>''To make any changes, the law requires that the space be handicapped accessible,'' said Donald T. Maiocco, the school's headmaster. ''This will allow us to comply with the letter and spirit of the law.''</p>
        <p>But residents and preservationists vehemently oppose the design. Community Board 8 recently passed a resolution arguing that the plan clashed with the architectural character of the building.</p>
        <p>''It's not about wheelchair access,'' said Myrna Wollitzer, who lives on the fifth floor. ''It's about the expansion of St. David's at the expense of our landmark building.'' The seven-story brick building has classrooms on the lower floors and apartments above.</p>
        <p>The Graham House was built in the early 1890's as an apartment hotel that aspired to imitate the grand buildings of the Upper West Side. Some people had referred to the building, with its ornate limestone moldings and carved cherry wood windows, as the poor man's Dakota.</p>
        <p>The school bought the property in 1971 and tried to evict several tenants with the purpose of putting up a larger building. Those plans never materialized, and Graham House was included in the expanded Carnegie Hill Historic District in 1994.</p>
        <p>Last year, the school replaced most of the building's 400 hand-crafted windows with stained wood and metal replicas, a move that further soured the school's relations with some residents.</p>
        <p>Taking a page from the fight of her neighbor, Woody Allen, who battled successfully against the construction of a high-rise nearby, Ms. Wollitzer submitted a 10-minute video about the building's history to the landmarks commission.</p>
        <p>Some preservationists have also argued that  doorways in an adjacent building could be altered with less impact. But Mr. Maiocco said the proposed design offered the most elegant solution and would provide handicapped students with the easiest route to an elevator planned for the main hall in Graham House.</p>
        <p>The commission plans to hold a hearing on the issue this month.</p>
