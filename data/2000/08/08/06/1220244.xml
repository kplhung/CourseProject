        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>We were delighted to see the warm appreciation of our late friend Hayward Cirker (''The Last Paperback Revolutionary,'' June 18); no full-page article could encompass the protean interests of this amazing, gentle man of letters. Our ''After the Ball'' Nonesuch album owed most of its repertory to the Dover Books ''Favorite Songs of the Nineties'' compilation. We have been close to him and his wife, Blanche, since that time; one of us was himself involved with a reissue (of a historically important orchestration book), and a better editor than Hayward would be unimaginable.</p>

        <p>It was, however, saddening to read the last paragraph, in which Tom Reiss excoriates the Dover dollar classics so often found throughout America. We do not find them a falling-off of the high standards Dover has come to represent. If Reiss toured around as much of the United States as we do, he would encounter many mall bookstores seemingly filled with nothing but best sellers, self-help books, romances and Danielle Steel -- except for the Dover dollar-book stand next to the cash register. In such cultural deserts (and there are many in this land of ours), one of these books in a reader's hands might change a life.</p>
