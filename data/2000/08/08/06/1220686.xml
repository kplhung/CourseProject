        <p>Robert S Gruber letter on Robert Lipsyte's July 30 column notes how Pee Wee Reese calmed down Jackie Robinson during 1947 game when opposing third-base coach made bigoted remarks against Robinson</p>

        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>Regarding Robert Lipsyte's column (''Two Statues but Myriad Lessons to Absorb,'' July 30) recounting the 1947 game in which Pee Wee Reese, as a symbol of support, put his arm on Jackie Robinson's shoulder: Reese spoke of this incident about four years ago at a discussion with old Dodger players at the 92nd Street Y.</p>
        <p>In essence, Reese said that he and Robinson were standing at second base before the home team's at-bat when the opponent's third base coach unleashed a bigoted verbal assault at Robinson. Reese saw Robinson's body coil as if he were about to make a violent charge at the coach. To prevent a serious fight, Reese put his arm on Robinson's shoulder and said, ''Calm down, Jack, calm down.'' And Robinson did.</p>

        <p>Incidentally, Reese could not recall the identity of the opposing team; Robinson's various biographers, too, differ as to which team was the host in this game.</p>
