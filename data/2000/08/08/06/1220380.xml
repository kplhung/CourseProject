        <p>Two investment banking companies, Salomon Brothers Smith Barney and Lehman Brothers, have leased all 78 furnished apartments in the Cambridge Club, a renovated building at 56 Pine Street in Manhattan's financial district.</p>
        <p>The companies are paying an average of $3,500 a month to rent each studio and one-bedroom apartment in the renovated building. Weekly maid service is provided.</p>
        <p>The deals were agreed to within 24 hours of the apartments going on the market at what was essentially the asking price, said Joseph Barbaccia, the president of Joseph Gregory Marketing, the rental agent. The companies plan to use the apartments to house employees coming to New York for corporate training programs. The property is owned by Cambridge Management, a subsidiary of Cambridge Development and Construction.</p>
        <p>The Cambridge Club has 28 studio apartments, 43 one-bedrooms and seven large loft studios ranging from 450 to 800 square feet. Twenty more apartments are to be added when a commercial tenant's lease on the lower three floors expires in a few years. The 16-story Romanesque Revival structure was built in 1893 as a commercial office building and was designated a city landmark in 1996.</p>
