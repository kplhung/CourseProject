        <p>On the menu at the Hopewell Inn -- which is decorated with a girl at a well -- there are chicken fingers among stuffed cabbage and pirogis. This tells you that in a restaurant with a smattering of standard American fare, the real treats are the Hungarian and German specialties.</p>
        <p>The Hopewell Inn, which is the name of both the former hotel and the restaurant in it, is more than 100 years old and was the operations center for reporters covering the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby from the family home nearby. For the past 23 years the inn has been owned and operated by Ernie and Rose Nemeth, with Mrs. Nemeth doing much of the cooking. The restaurant often gets tourists stopping in town to see the renovated train station or the town's famous gazebo, but it also is a favorite stop for locals.</p>

        <p>The Hopewell Inn, which is the name of both the former hotel and the restaurant in it, is more than 100 years old and was the operations center for reporters covering the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby from the family home nearby. For the past 23 years the inn has been owned and operated by Ernie and Rose Nemeth, with Mrs. Nemeth doing much of the cooking. The restaurant often gets tourists stopping in town to see the renovated train station or the town's famous gazebo, but it also is a favorite stop for locals.</p>
        <p>Lunch specials include home-cooked stuffed cabbage or stuffed peppers, which have flavorful pork and beef stuffing cooked just right to retain a touch of crispness. A typical American offering is a generous portion of sliced turkey with mashed potatoes -- no slice of white bread underneath to stretch the portion and the stomach. Lunch for two can run as little as $15.</p>
        <p>Dinner specialties include Hungarian chicken paprika, homemade egg dumplings and a Budapest mixed grill that includes two filet mignons, two pork chops, kielbasa and stuffed cabbage that is billed as a $36.95 meal for two -- a bit higher than the Quick Bite rating, but in fact it can satisfy at least four people. Patrons can eat in the dining room, which seats 80, or at the bar. Susan Molnar, the Nemeth's daughter, and her husband, Paul, are in the process of taking over the restaurant. They had owned a bistro in Pennington. The same basic menu and generous portions will be retained, and Rose Nemeth will continue to do much of the cooking, Mrs. Molnar said.</p>
