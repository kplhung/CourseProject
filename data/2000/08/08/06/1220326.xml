        <p>TWO souls do dwell, alas!, within my breast,'' cries the title character of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's ''Faust.'' Struggling between his thirst for pure knowledge and his desire for earthly pleasures, he finally chooses youth over embittered old age, signs a pact with the devil and embarks on the epic drama that is the cornerstone of German literature -- a text, some say, that is a key to understanding the German soul.</p>
        <p>There are also two souls within ''Faust.'' ''Faust,'' Part 1, published in 1808 and a work of both Goethe's youth and maturity, contains the well-known plot -- the bargain of the learned Doctor Faust with Mephistopheles, the seduction of the innocent Gretchen -- that has been echoed in novels, movies, puppet shows and several operas. ''Faust,'' Part 2, written in Goethe's old age and published shortly after his death in 1832, is more abstract, disjunct -- Faust travels from the court of the Emperor Maximilian to the shores of classical antiquity -- and downright difficult. It is seldom read and hardly ever staged.</p>
        <p>So when one of Germany's most celebrated theatrical directors, Peter Stein, determined to mount a production of the complete uncut ''Faust,'' Parts 1 and 2, it became an event of national magnitude. Asserting that no one has ever presented an unedited staging of the work, Mr. Stein calls his ''Faust'' a world premiere, and it has certainly gained the equivalent attention. Tickets for the production, which opened on July 22 at Expo 2000 in this northwestern German city, sold out within hours when sales began in January. The premiere was front-page news in every paper in the country. And this even though the full play lasts a total of 21 hours, including intermissions. The production is being presented in Hall 23 at the world's fair here in two formats: in two-day marathons on Saturdays (7 hours) and Sundays (14 hours), and on six consecutive nights.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Stein, 62, staging ''Faust'' was a longtime dream that somehow had never been realized: not at the Berlin Schaubuhne, which he took over in 1970 and where he made his reputation as a revolutionary during a 15-year tenure, nor at the Salzburg Festival, where he was the head of the spoken theater branch from 1991 to 1997 under Gerard Mortier. During those years, Mr. Stein developed a reputation for seeking an ever-larger canvas as well as complete control over his projects. The size and scale on which he prefers to work were evident in an earlier project in 1994 in Moscow: a staging of the ''Oresteia'' trilogy, a theater marathon in its own right.</p>
        <p>But the director had not forgotten his dream; he had been trying to find sponsors for ''Faust'' all along. Expo was the first organization to make him a concrete offer of $2 million. But that wasn't nearly enough to finance the kind of staging the director had in mind. The 33 actors in ''Faust,'' including the Swiss-born star Bruno Ganz -- one of the leads in Wim Wenders's film ''Wings of Desire'' -- started rehearsals a year before the premiere. The cast is committed to the production through December 2001, going on, after Expo ends in October, to a 37-week run in Berlin and a 15-week run in Vienna. With healthy subsidies from DaimlerChrysler, Deutsche Bank and the German federal government, the project has ended up costing about $15 million. ''Wonderful,'' say some Germans; ''megalomania,'' say others.</p>
        <p>MR. STEIN'S ''Faust'' was to be a highlight of another project with megalomaniacal aspects: Expo 2000 in Hanover. The first world's fair held in Germany, Expo was forecast as Europe's biggest event of the new century, with an expected 40 million visitors thronging to see elaborate new national pavilions and an extensive theme park with exhibits devoted to Expo 2000's theme: ''Humankind-Nature-Technology: A New World Arising.''</p>
        <p>But walking through the grounds of the fair is a reminder that there are also two souls in the breast of Germany. One is the spirit of culture or learning that makes the staging of a work as challenging as ''Faust'' the talk of the entire country. The other is the more earthly spirit responsible for the ''economic miracle'' of fat-cat postwar Germany: a spirit that tends to express itself in a kind of earnest, dull didacticism and in huge trade fairs.</p>
        <p>These characteristics are prominent at Expo 2000, which is also making headlines -- as a flop. People are staying away in droves, put off by high prices, negative assessments in the press and a geographical location that nobody is interested in visiting. As the arts pages of Germany's newspapers were filled with articles about ''Faust'' in the days leading up to the premiere, the financial pages were devoted to stories about Expo 2000's lack of visitors, a desperate new advertising campaign and the question of whether the government would step in and bail the fair out of a debt that Germany's education minister fears could exceed $900 million.</p>
        <p>''Faust'' is hardly going to affect the financial fate of Expo 2000, since there are only 460 seats available on any given night. But the work itself does echo Expo's stated theme, exploring the relationship of man and technology. And Mr. Stein's staging of it also represents a huge endeavor, comparable to the scale on which Expo 2000 was conceived.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stein's goal was to create a monument to Goethe's masterpiece, and to do so in a spirit of reverence rather than reinterpretation. His main concern, he has emphasized, was to reproduce the text as faithfully as possible. ''I don't want to reinvent theater,'' he said in a recent telephone interview from his home in Rome. ''I want to bring the experience I have amassed in 35 years of working in the theater and place it at the disposal of this piece.''</p>
        <p>But his intention to follow Goethe's stage directions and vision to the letter, changing not a word of the original poem, aroused skepticism from those who believe a director's job is not merely to present a piece but to interpret it as well: to create, in other words, the kind of Regietheater, or directors' theater, that Mr. Stein and his peers have helped to define.</p>
        <p>''Stein was one of the great revitalizers of German theater in the 1960's and 1970's,'' said Andreas Mury, the theater critic for the weekly newsmagazine Fokus. ''But now he has turned away from the principles that made him famous. He has become reactionary. Simply taking a text and putting it onstage -- that's not artistic.''</p>
        <p>A certain amount of theatrical artistry is required to get Goethe's text -- with its witches, Greek gods and startling metamorphoses -- on the stage in any form. ''In the 20th century,'' Mr. Stein said, ''artistic forms developed that allow this piece to be performed.''</p>
        <p>The idea of a choppy, episodic presentation is not as foreign to a modern audience as it might have been to one in Goethe's time; Mr. Stein likens Part 2, in particular, to cabaret. At the same time, he said: ''We have developed theatrical structures akin to the ones Goethe uses. The idea of a circle, of something coming up again and again, was a formal principle of Goethe's.''</p>
        <p>In other words, in Mr. Stein's view, it is only now possible, in the early 21st century, to stage the piece at all. And he paid tribute to the idea of the circle by using a spiral to represent the approach to heaven. In the first scene, a circular metal construction was suspended from the flies overhead with a few actors representing angels aboard; in the very last scene, the circle unwound into a spiral path along which the angels led Faust, now redeemed, to the Almighty.</p>
        <p>In general, however, the most avant-garde element in the work of Mr. Stein's two set designers (Ferdinand Wogerbauer for Part 1 and Stefan Mayer for Part 2) and the costume designer (Moidele Bickel) is the juxtaposition of elements both traditional and modern in the service of illustrating the story. Some sets are as conventionally representative as Faust's messy, manuscript-lined study, erected on a proscenium-style stage; others as abstract as the geometric contours of a forbidding, fortress-like mountain in the fourth act of Part 2. The witch's kitchen where Mephistopheles takes Faust for the potion he needs to regain his youth is inhabited by marvelous, ''Planet of the Apes''-style monkeys and a witch who looks like something out of a Halloween decoration, warts and all. By contrast, the centaur Chiron is a man fastened to a wheeled metal contraption that forms his horsey hindquarters and back legs: a more modern, if no less literal, representation of a mythological creature.</p>
        <p>Another modern element is the way Mr. Stein involves the audience. There are two separate performance spaces in Hall 23, each fitted out with bleacherlike seating that is continually reconfigured to create various arenas for the different scenes. The audience is kept moving between these spaces, each time taking a different place, sometimes in regular seats, sometimes standing on risers, and even, at the Emperor Maximilian's court, sitting at banquet tables set with glasses of real wine.</p>
        <p>Moving from one space to another creates a kind of theatrical democracy: no one is guaranteed a better seat than anyone else. An unfortunate by-product of this concept, at least during the premiere, was a kind of cattle-stampede effect every time the doors opened, as elegantly clad, presumably sophisticated men and women practically mowed one another down in their efforts to get a good spot. But at least it kept everyone awake.</p>
        <p>The theme of duality was also present in the casting: Mr. Stein divided each of the two leading parts -- Faust and Mephistopheles -- between two actors. This meant that the younger version of Bruno Ganz's Faust was to be played by Christian Nickel, 31. But the concept ran into some problems.</p>
        <p>IN the case of Mephistopheles, one of the devils, Robert Hunger-Buhler, another Swiss actor, was much better than the other, Johann Adam Oest. Mr. Oest tended to bluster ineffectively, while Mr. Hunger-Buhler was at once suave and earthy, understated yet in perfect control. The contrast between the two performers gave the character a regrettable disjointedness.</p>
        <p>Far worse was the news, five weeks before the premiere, that Mr. Ganz had fallen from a ladder in rehearsal and broken his wrist and pelvis. After speculation about whether the premiere would be called off, Mr. Nickel took over the entire role, a speaking part that adds up to about six hours. He did remarkably well under the circumstances, but his performance was, naturally, uneven. Surprisingly, he was more convincing as the older Faust than as the hot-headed young seducer of Gretchen, the role in which he was originally cast. As a young man, he lacked the sense of making up for lost time that motivates Faust's disregard for Gretchen's feelings and her future.</p>
        <p>Faust's actions were all the harder to understand because the Gretchen, Dorothee Hartinger, was so excellent: believable but never cloying in her innocence, a bit saucy, and heartbreaking in her final madness.</p>
        <p>In part because of the absence of Mr. Ganz, Mr. Stein said, he regards the performances on July 22 and 23 as a phase in a continuing process rather than a premiere. ''The real premiere will take place in December,'' he said, when ''Faust'' opens in Berlin; by then, Mr. Ganz should have resumed his role.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Mr. Stein himself sustained physical injury in the pursuit of his dream. During a rehearsal, he closed a rusted metal door on one of his index fingers, and half the finger had to be amputated. Of course there were comments that Mr. Stein had made his own pact with the devil, sealed, literally, with flesh and blood.</p>
        <p>Intentionally or no, it was just this kind of literal-mindedness that characterized the whole production. In Goethe's text, Mephistopheles first appears to Faust in the guise of a black poodle: so there, onstage, was a real black poodle, too cute and well trained to evoke anything very diabolical and greeted with affectionate titters by the audience. When Goethe's stage direction reads that Mephistopheles enters by emerging from a pair of seven-league boots (an image from German fairy tales), Mr. Stein has him come out from behind a pair of huge red boots. And when Faust's former student, Wagner, creates his own hominid in a glass beaker in his laboratory, Mr. Stein had a little boy in a glowing glass ball suspended over the stage, an original test-tube baby.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, this kind of literalness can approach caricature. In Part 1, it seemed that Mr. Stein might have been deliberately working tongue in cheek; after all, he had been quoted before the premiere as saying that ''any idiot can stage Part 1.'' But in Part 2, he followed the text as literally as he had done in Part 1 -- and it fell flat. The actors declaimed each and every line and wore costumes Goethe might have recognized: the sea gods ''swam,'' miming the freedom of moving through the water with the help of invisible roller blades; carnival figures danced, strutted and expostulated from beneath their comic masks between the ranks of standing audience members. But it was hard to tell what was going on. At moments, when a foreign critic might struggle to follow the words, perhaps during what is called the Classical Walpurgisnacht section in Part 2, many of the native Germans in the audience seemed to be asleep.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stein has spent years trying to understand Part 2 of ''Faust,'' and now that he has finally come to terms with it -- to the envy of many of his compatriots -- he talks about it with unconcealed excitement. ''Goethe is trying to deal with the subject of the genetic program of the human race,'' he said. ''Man does whatever he is able to, even if it's harmful to nature, or to himself. He won't refrain from doing something he's able to do just because it's bad for the environment. That's the Mephistophelean element of the human race. With the help of the devil, Faust can do everything he wants to; at the end, he's draining the ocean, creating a new society. And he fails. But all of this happens in a very humorous way. Goethe described it as very serious jokes.''</p>
        <p>If only more of that excitement, and humor, had come across. Flushed with discovery, Mr. Stein may have forgotten how much of the text still needs to be explained to others. On the page, the words seem livelier and funnier than they do in the stentorian readings of Mr. Stein's actors. Which brings to mind another observation that Goethe made about Part 2, to wit, that it is unstageable.</p>
        <p>For once, the critics were virtually unanimous. ''A disappointment,'' said the Suddeutsche Zeitung of Munich. ''Too much Goethe, too little Stein,'' said Die Welt. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung compared Mr. Stein's pursuit of ''Faust'' to that of a young man who spends his life running after a young woman, finally gets together with her in old age for a night of passion, and has no idea what to do with her, ultimately stripping off her clothes and leaving her, naked but untouched, on the ground.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stein's description of Man doing something simply because he can applies (as he well knows) especially to himself, embarking on this seemingly impossible theatrical project simply because he could. The consensus after the first round is that he, like Faust, has failed.</p>
        <p>And yet it may not be that simple. In his goal of creating a monument to the greatest work of German literature, Mr. Stein may have succeeded. For monuments are also for the general public; and in avoiding interpretive excess, the director may have won over a wider popular audience to his vision. However flawed the production, there is something undeniably exhilarating about experiencing this whole text in two days.</p>
        <p>It may emerge that there are two souls within the German audience as well. The critical one has had its say, but the popular one raised its voice at the end of the premiere in jubilant ovation. An account of the dress rehearsal in Die Welt am Sonntag, one of Germany's less intellectual newspapers, was ecstatic. Furthermore, plenty of people will be able to see some of ''Faust'' without sitting through the entire 21 hours, if they choose single evenings from the six-consecutive-night format.</p>
        <p>DOES Faust really fail? At the start of Part 1, the doctor, sick of words, demands deeds. Nonetheless, he remains more a man of letters than of action. In translating Goethe's text from page to stage, Mr. Stein is also moving from word to deed. The complete ''Faust'' may remain more successful as a literary creation than as a work for the theater. But for Peter Stein, as for Doctor Faust, the act of striving for deeds is what makes it a story in the first place.</p>
