        <p>Most of the Most of S. J. Perelman. (Modern Library, $15.95.) These essays by the cranky, urbane humorist, first published between 1930 and 1958, zing targets large and small, from Hollywood to Raymond Chandler and Groucho Marx. ''Perelman misses no mad word we write or say, and its image and essence he translates back to us with an artistry acute, brilliant, devastating and . . . funny,'' Eudora Welty wrote in the Book Review in 1958.</p>
        <p>Spinners, by Anthony McCarten. (Harper Perennial, $13.) In this first novel, a 16-year-old girl discombobulates a small town in rural New Zealand when she claims to have been abducted and molested by space aliens. ''McCarten is part barker, part juggler, part aerialist,'' David Finkle said here last year. ''He hangs attributes on his characters as if they were caps and bells, and he has these unwitting jesters say and do thigh-slapping things.''</p>
        <p>Appointment at the Ends of the World: Memoirs of a Wildlife Veterinarian, by William B. Karesh. (Warner, $13.95.) The author, who works for the Wildlife Conservation Society, describes his harrowing, often hazardous, job making house calls around the world and helping the society in its far-flung research efforts. In 1999 our reviewer, Marcia Bartusiak, called this an ''engaging memoir'' that ''puts the need for conservation on a personal level.'' Elephant Memories: Thirteen Years in the Life of an Elephant Family, by Cynthia Moss (University of Chicago, $18), follows the histories of 25 or so elephants in Amboseli National Park in Kenya, detailing their daily lives and close family bonds. ''Moss tells the story in a style so conversational, so free of academic jargon, that I felt like a privileged visitor riding beside her in her rickety Land-Rover as she showed me around the park,'' Sarah Blaffer Hrdy wrote here in 1988.</p>
        <p>Pushkin's BUtton, by Serena Vitale. (University of Chicago, $16.) An Italian scholar mines family archives, diplomatic records and letters in this meticulous account of the impulsive Russian poet's death in a duel in 1837 and of the society that allowed people to settle grievances in such a way. The result ''is a delightful combination of retrograde pleasures (court balls, the demise of a doomed genius) and primary sources,'' Richard Lamb wrote here in 1999.</p>
        <p>The True History of Paradise, by Margaret Cezair-Thompson. (Plume, $13.95.) Set in Jamaica in 1981, this ambitious first novel uses the experiences of a young woman trying to flee her homeland during a time of political upheaval to explore the island's vibrant history and culture. Last year in these pages, Madison Smartt Bell admired the author's ''talent, grace and confidence.''</p>
        <p>The Book of Blam, by Aleksandar Tisma. (Harvest/Harcourt, $13.) This novel, originally published in Yugoslavia in 1972, traces a family history of Hapsburg Jews migrating across Eastern Europe in the 19th century and describes in chilling detail the massacre of thousands of Jews and Serbs in the city of Novi Sad by the Hungarian military in 1942. '' 'The Book of Blam' offers a literary memorial to the former Jews of the former Yugoslavia,'' Larry Wolff wrote in the Book Review last year.</p>
        <p>Liar's Moon: A Long Story, by Philip Kimball. (Plume, $12.95.) This neo-western, in which two toddlers fall off a wagon and are raised by coyotes, ''explores the horizon where the West of myth and the West of reality merge,'' Alanna Nash wrote here in 1999. ''Kimball's bold use of character and language puts a new jingle into the step of an often hoary genre.''</p>
        <p>Can You Wave Bye Bye, Baby?: Stories, by Elyse Gasco. (Picador USA, $12.) These seven interwoven tales, each dealing with contentious issues of adoption and parenthood, feature mothers who are biologically or emotionally uncertain and fathers who, while absent or unhelpful, have no such doubts. ''Moments of insight are one of the strengths of Gasco's collection,'' Margot Livesey said here in 1999. ''Another is its zany humor.''</p>
        <p>The Code Book: The Science of Secrecy From Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography, by Simon Singh. (Anchor, $14.) The author employs a series of historical incidents, including a plot to assassinate Queen Elizabeth I and put Mary, Queen of Scots on the English throne, in this survey of code making through the ages. ''The almost universal fascination with codes undoubtedly derives from the extraordinary feats of ingenuity that have gone into devising and breaking them, as well as their enormous impact on world events,'' Robert Osserman said here last year. ''Singh's book offers more than its share of both.''</p>
