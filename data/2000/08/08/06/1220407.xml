        <p>FIFTY-EIGHT works of art, wrapped in brown cardboard, stood lined up on the floor against the freshly painted, unadorned walls in the galleries at the Katonah Museum of Art here. The works had traveled from their homes -- in museums, with artists and in private collections -- in climate-controlled trucks.</p>
        <p>The second leg of their journey, from floor to gallery wall, involved much shorter distances but no less care. It was three days before the opening last month of the exhibit ''Maine and the Modern Spirit,'' time to turn a long-planned show into reality.</p>
        <p>The chief installer, Michael Prudhomme, lifted strips of blue painter's tape off the glass surface of a Robert Indiana silkscreen. The tape holds the glass in place should it happen to break in transit, a misfortune that can get an installation off on the wrong foot.</p>
        <p>With magnifying glass in hand, Julie Kelly, a former museum registrar who inspects the works as they are unwrapped, leaned over the Indiana silkscreen and, in true sleuthing style, spotted a little residue on the surface. ''Oh, it's just dust,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The art arrives packed in glassine, a transparent glazed paper, lots of plastic bubble paper and corrugated cardboard, layered like children bundled up in extra sweaters going off on the school bus in winter. Some are crated. Notes are made on the sequence of the wrappings so they can be sent back exactly as they came in. ''Unwrapping these paintings is no different than Christmas or birthdays,'' Mr. Prudhomme said. ''Always a surprise. For me it's like going to graduate school and getting paid for it.''</p>
        <p>Flashlight in hand and crouching on the floor in front of a painting by Edward Hopper on loan from the Whitney Museum in Manhattan, Ms. Kelly detected a minute indentation on the bottom of the canvas, indicating, she said, slight paint loss. She noted this on a diagram on a form that is filled out for each work upon arrival and again at departure.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kelly said she loves this detective work, a process that in museum terminology is called ''conditioning in a painting.'' It gives her an intimate, hands-on connection to the art.  ''You can find things on the back the public doesn't see,'' she said. ''I found a poem by Emerson on the back of a Frederic Remington painting in the Adirondack show here in 1992.''</p>
        <p>Anne Holman, registrar at the Katonah Museum and therefore responsible for the transportation, insurance, care, handling and security of the art, is less enthusiastic about the installation part of exhibition work. ''Getting the paintings up on the wall safely and in a timely fashion is nerve-racking to me,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Once the art is unpacked and conditioned in the fun begins, said Shauna Mosseri, the architect and exhibition designer for the ''Maine'' exhibition. She had seen the slides sent by the lenders and designed a tentative arrangement plan. She designed two free-standing walls to create intimate spaces within big spaces, and developed the color palette, a series of sun-faded, dense greens and blues subtly evoking the sea and pines of Maine.</p>
        <p>''Hanging the paintings is a thoughtful process,'' she said. ''The actual works have their own aura, scale and sensibility. The reality of them is so different from the slides.''</p>
        <p>Paintings need to be enhanced by their place on the wall, displayed to seduce the viewer. Thinking out loud and talking to the crew, Ms. Mosseri played with different placements. ''Put the purple fires on the green wall for a second,'' she said. ''Could be a disaster. I don't know, I don't know. I'd rather have a landscape.''</p>
        <p>Curators are usually present at installations, but Susan Larsen, who chose the works of art for this exhibition, relayed her suggestions by telephone from Tenant's Harbor, Me., where she lives. ''Installation is the biggest treat of the whole project,'' she said. ''If I weren't 10 hours away I'd be hanging around.''</p>
        <p>The track lighting, soft and focused on each work and designed here by Mr. Prudhomme, is done at the end, as are the computer-printed transparent labels. The temperature and humidity, which needs to be between 68 and 72 degrees with a relative humidity of 50 percent, is checked in front of each painting with a device called a hygrothermograph. A light meter held by hand within a half inch of the painting measures the foot candles of light, which are generally kept at 10.</p>
        <p>This exhibition was simpler to install than some other shows, Evelyn Fay, project director, said. She recalled, for example, a 1996 exhibition that involved building a Buddhist temple and the Adirondack exhibition, which included a tent filled with furniture and a canoe placed on glass-like material to create the illusion of water. ''It's theater,'' she said.</p>
        <p>What to put next to a particularly dynamic painting of two bright red horses by Charles DuBack in 1956? Although the exhibition is ''loosely chronological,'' Ms. Fay tried a much later painting of a young clam digger, done by John Heliker in 1992. ''It just worked,'' she said. ''It's calm, recessive and is so good it can't be eclipsed.''</p>
        <p>The show runs through Sept. 24.</p>
