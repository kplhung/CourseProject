        <p>OFFICE rents, which have been rising steadily for several years, spiked upward in the second quarter of this year, leading some real estate executives to express concern that vital service providers, such as smaller law and accounting firms, may be driven out of Manhattan.</p>
        <p>According to figures compiled by the Williams Real Estate company, the average annual asking rent for office space in Manhattan increased 16.9 percent in the three months that ended in June, to $54.44 a square foot. Asking rents have increased 28.1 percent since the beginning of the year; the year-to-year increase was 35.3 percent.</p>

        <p>OFFICE rents, which have been rising steadily for several years, spiked upward in the second quarter of this year, leading some real estate executives to express concern that vital service providers, such as smaller law and accounting firms, may be driven out of Manhattan.</p>
        <p>According to figures compiled by the Williams Real Estate company, the average annual asking rent for office space in Manhattan increased 16.9 percent in the three months that ended in June, to $54.44 a square foot. Asking rents have increased 28.1 percent since the beginning of the year; the year-to-year increase was 35.3 percent.</p>
        <p>The increase in rents is directly linked to the shrinking amount of space available for occupancy. Williams calculates that the overall vacancy rate for all office space in Manhattan is 5.1 percent, a decrease of 14.2 percent during the second quarter and a drop of 47.7 percent from June 1999.</p>
        <p>And the averages understate the actual shortage of space available at what many consider affordable rents. In the Midtown market, 53.5 percent of the space on the market had an asking annual rent under $50 a square foot at the end of the second quarter of 1999. By the end of June this year, only 9 percent of the space was under $50 a square foot.</p>
        <p>''A plausible Midtown business address is going to cost at least $55 a square foot and more likely $60 or $70,'' said Michael T. Cohen, the president of Williams. ''For a while the financial district was the last refuge for companies priced out of Midtown, but it's not a refuge anymore. The space has been absorbed, and the rents spiked again in the last quarter.''</p>
        <p>The downtown business district had a 12 percent availability rate at the end of the second quarter of 1999 and an average annual rental rate in the low $30's a square foot. By the end of June this year, the availability was under 6 percent and the average rent over $40 a square foot.</p>
        <p>''The vacancy rate is at the lowest point in 20 years,'' said Steven A. Swerdlow, senior managing director of the New York office of CB Richard Ellis, a real estate services company. ''And rents have eclipsed the highs of the early 1980's on an inflation-adjusted basis.''</p>
        <p>The strength of the market is all the more remarkable because of the recovery from the financial crises in several parts of the world in the fall of 1998, said Barry Gosin, the chief executive of Newmark &amp; Company Real Estate, a brokerage and property management company. ''People were very concerned there would be no liquidity, but now with the economy healthy and growing, everybody needs space.''</p>
        <p>Once again the averages mask some of the high points in a market where prosperous companies needing space to grow compete with one another for the limited amount available. ''I am negotiating rates that start at $115 a square foot,'' said Tara Stacom, an executive director at Cushman &amp; Wakefield, a large brokerage and real estate services company. ''My father [Matthew J. Stacom, also an official at Cushman &amp; Wakefield] predicted we would see rates of $100 a square foot by the end of the century, and people told him he was crazy. Well here we are and here they are.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen said he was concerned that Manhattan would become home to an elite, with only the biggest, richest companies able to pay the rent to stay at prime locations. He said it would be bad for the city in the long term, and bad for his business as well.</p>
        <p>Medium-size law firms, those with fewer than 100 lawyers, and moderate-size accounting firms are coming under intense pressure as a result of the rising rents. He said that one law firm that is his client -- which he would not name -- recently agreed to a rent increase before the expiration of its current lease to avoid being pushed immediately to the market rate when it rolls over.</p>
        <p>''You like to think of New York as a land of opportunity, with a quilt of entrepreneurial companies of different sizes,'' he said. ''But if only the big, rich companies can afford to stay, that thins out the city's economic base and leaves it vulnerable in the long term.''</p>
        <p>IN addition to the big picture, Mr. Cohen said he had strong little-picture fears as well. ''I am a purchaser of legal and accounting services and I get better quality services when there are many firms competing for my business,'' he said. ''If high rents thin out the ranks of local services providers, that works to my disadvantage.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Swerdlow said he also saw that as a danger. ''There will be haves and have  nots,'' he said. He said that Internet and new-media companies say they cannot afford to wait for new construction, such as the million-square-foot building Forest City Ratner Companies is planning at its Metrotech complex in Brooklyn, and so they increase the pressure in the existing market.</p>
        <p>If only the richest companies can remain in Manhattan, ''it changes the fabric of city life,'' said Mary Ann Tighe, vice chairman of Insignia/ESG, a real estate brokerage and services company. ''It will be different if only the top knowledge workers and their immediate support staff remain, and the effects will ripple out to the stores and restaurants.''</p>
        <p>Real estate executives said they saw nothing on the horizon to dampen the office market in Manhattan and said it would continue to drive tenants to look for alternatives such as Jersey City and the rest of the New Jersey coast facing the city. Many say they expect more building in downtown Brooklyn and in the Long Island City section of Queens.</p>
        <p>And the remaining fringes of Manhattan are expected to be renovated for tenants who cannot overcome a reluctance to cross a river.</p>
        <p>''We are going to see a lot of activity on 11th and 12th Avenues between 30th and 59th Street,'' said James S. Meiskin, president of Plymouth Partners, a brokerage specializing in representing tenants.</p>
        <p>This area is one of the last sections of Manhattan that is primarily industrial, with garage, warehouses and distribution centers. But the successful conversion of old factories farther south in Chelsea to offices for new media and Internet companies makes it likely there will be demand for office space farther north.</p>
        <p>The high rents for office space are forcing companies to decide how many people they actually need in Manhattan, and how many might be just as well based in less costly boroughs and suburbs, real estate executives say.</p>
        <p>Regardless of the effect it may have on the ambience of the city, economics are forcing tenant companies to look hard at their Manhattan operations. ''Every business has to consider why they are here,'' Ms. Tighe said. ''They have to determine what kind of work has a profit margin that justifies housing a person in Manhattan.''</p>
        <p>As companies split their operations, with  only the high-value-added jobs staying in Manhattan, the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens should benefit, she said. ''Queens is going to be hopping and downtown Brooklyn is going to be active too,'' Ms. Tighe said. ''These areas have not shared in the job growth because, at least in the past, people wanted Manhattan addresses.''</p>
        <p>But even soaring rents are not a deterrent to companies that are lacking an even more precious commodity: skilled workers to operate the business.</p>
        <p>''I have two clients who moved out and are trying to move back in,'' Ms. Stacom said. ''They couldn't find the labor they needed and they're trying to come back because New York still has the right labor supply.''</p>
