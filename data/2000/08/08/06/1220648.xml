        <p>Kerry Sanders, who suffered from schizophrenia, often lived on the streets of Los Angeles. Robert Sanders, a career criminal, escaped from a prison in the Bronx. They looked nothing alike. Their fingerprints, of course, did not match. They simply shared a last name and date of birth.  Yet for two years, Kerry Sanders was imprisoned as Robert Sanders at Green Haven Correctional Facility in Stormville, N.Y. He constantly asked the staff there why he was in prison. He constantly told them his name was not Robert. He told them a lot of things, especially about his life in Los Angeles. None of it matched the information in their files on Robert Sanders. But no one noticed. A report by Benjamin Weiser in The Times Magazine.</p>
