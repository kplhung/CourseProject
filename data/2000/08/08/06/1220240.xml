        <p>If it could be said that there is a tide in the affairs of literary studies, it might now be ventured that there are indications -- hints, clues, suggestions -- that the flood tide of theory in the academy has begun to ebb and questions of value and aesthetics have begun to creep back in.</p>
        <p>In fact I feel I may have been a witness to the moment when the tide could be seen to turn -- a remarkable moment in which a hard-core theory partisan delivered an eloquent, witty and rueful critique of the reign of theory. The occasion was the annual meeting of the Shakespeare Association of America, at a seminar on the cultural and commercial phenomenon of Harold Bloom's best-selling book ''Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human.'' Shakespeare, of course, has been a focus of the theory wars from the beginning: for those who believe in ''the death of the author,'' he is the author whose dissolution into autonomous ''discourses'' was most devoutly to be wished.</p>
        <p>My sense of that seminar as a turning point comes from three decades of observing Shakespeare studies, ever since witnessing the Last Great Transition at ground zero in the Yale graduate English department, when the theorists began to supersede the ''close readers'' of the New Criticism. What followed was an entire generation of the best and brightest graduate students earning tenure by turning Shakespeare's works into exemplars of various Continental theorists ranging from Jacques Derrida and deconstruction to Michel Foucault and the new historicism, Theodor Adorno and postmodern Marxism to Jacques Lacan and postmodern Freudianism. It was a time when theorizing Shakespeare replaced reading, seeing or enacting Shakespeare for academics specializing in ''early modern'' literature, to use the term favored to replace ''Renaissance'' literature (which implies that the rebirth of Western civilization was a good thing).</p>
        <p>The theorizing tendency -- which argues that the artistic value of what Shakespeare wrote is not merely overrated but irrelevant, as are all questions of value -- could be seen, in the beginning at least, as a salutary response to ''Bardolatry,'' the uncritical celebration of Shakespearean genius. And yet the theorists came to share with the Bardolaters a certain overheated obsession with perfection: If the Bardolaters regard Shakespeare as the Perfect Master and the job of a scholar to further reveal his perfection, the theorists, in effect, regard Shakespeare as a Perfect Slave -- a slave to the power relations of his moment in history, ''the hegemony'' whose forces his work perfectly represents.</p>
        <p>But at the Shakespeare scholars' convention this spring in Montreal, there were signs that theory's partisans were having second thoughts about their own hegemony. Consider the first ''paper session,'' at which three scholars delivered related talks, in a forum entitled ''Before Theory.'' All were surprisingly respectful appreciations of Shakespearean commentaries by three pretheoretical literary figures: T. S. Eliot, Oscar Wilde and William Empson, a New Critic and an avatar of close reading. These are figures who had long been relegated by the postmodernists to the dustbin of history as woefully ''undertheorized.''</p>
        <p>And consider as well ''Shakespeare After Theory,'' a new book by a presenter at a subsequent paper session, David Scott Kastan of Columbia University, who is a general editor of the Arden Shakespeare, a leading scholarly edition of the plays. Whatever its achievements, ''theory's day has passed,'' Kastan argues in his book. He cites as evidence ''the Modern Language Association job listings from which theory jobs, after a proliferation in the early 1980's, have now virtually disappeared.'' (In part that's because so many theorists have filled up the tenured positions, of course.) Kastan believes that we are entering a post-theory age ''not because theory has been discredited; on the contrary . . . in explaining the mystifications that have dominated our categories of literary analysis, theory has now brought us to the point where we must begin to respond . . . not by producing more theory but more facts'' -- facts about ''the actual historical circumstances of literary production and reception.'' Facts are not as seductive as theory, not as sexy as the power-centered new historicism, Kastan conceded in his talk. In a good-natured way, he even calls his fact-based investigations into the collaboration among printers, booksellers and theatrical managers in the making of Shakespeare ''the new boredom.''</p>
        <p>If Before Theory and After Theory were hot topics at the Shakespeare Association convention, what to do During Theory had clearly been ''problematized,'' as theorists like to say. Lately, for instance, there has been more excitement in two other areas of Shakespeare scholarship: textual studies, which in the past two decades has produced a challenging if still controversial new picture of Shakespeare as a recurrent reviser of his work, and performance studies, which focuses on directors and actors (and increasingly filmmakers) as what you might call the working theorists of Shakespeare.</p>
        <p>What was shocking about the seminar on Harold Bloom's book was the candor with which one of theory's own, one of the brightest adepts, delivered a call for self-criticism that amounted to a ''goodbye to all that'' valedictory to theory. Her name is Linda Charnes; she is a professor of English at Indiana University and the author of a Harvard University Press book called ''Notorious Identity: Materializing the Subject in Shakespeare.'' Just to get a feel for the customary texture of her prose style when she's ''doing theory,'' consider this excerpt from her recent essay called ''We Were Never Early Modern,'' ostensibly on ''Hamlet'':</p>
        <p>''Mass culture is being increasingly 'quilted,' to use Lacan's term, by the points de capiton of what I would call the 'apparitional historical.' It is therefore no accident that 'Hamlet' is the play to which contemporary culture most frequently returns. Hamlet-the-prince has come to stand for the dilemma of historicity itself. . . . But the subject of affective time is incommensurable with the order, and the nature, of events. This was one of Lacan's greatest insights, and one of his advances over Freud: his assertion that the true subject of the 'impossible real' isn't constituted by her narrative reconstruction of her 'story' but rather by the failure of that story to 'include' its affective event-horizon -- its epistemological starting- and end-point. As Joan Copjec has recently written about the Lacanian gaze. . . .''</p>
        <p>Some might see this as an example of what Frank Kermode, the noted British Shakespearean, complains about when he speaks of those who profess to be concerned with Shakespeare while actually using Shakespeare to write about more fashionable concerns. But something has happened to cause Charnes to question her ''practice'' (as theorists like to call their work) in terms almost as critical as Kermode. I wondered if it might have to do with a seminar she led at last year's Shakespeare Association convention, which I also audited, on '' 'Hamlet,' 'Troilus,' 'Measure for Measure' and the Interpretation of Time,'' a seminar that found itself hopelessly entangled in a prolonged and comically futile effort to reach agreement on the nature or existence of ''inwardness.''</p>
        <p>But in the year since the inwardness debacle, something else had happened that caused Charnes to look outward: the Harold Bloom phenomenon. As Charnes wryly observed, addressing the seminar on Bloom, he is ''someone who comes from our ranks and has contemptuously risen above them and has written a best-selling and profitable book. . . . How dare he make us vulnerable to well-meaning family members who say, 'Who is this Bloom guy? You should write a book on Shakespeare that could make the New York Times best-seller list.' ''</p>
        <p>Bloom is a ''tempting target,'' she suggested to her fellow theorists sitting around the seminar table and to the 25 or so auditors like myself seated around the perimeter of the room. But the public's embrace of such theoretically unfashionable concepts in Bloom's book as ''poetic genius, great intelligence in art, terms that postmodernists dismiss,'' argues that ''we'd better look very carefully not at what Bloom's doing, but what we're doing in the academy.''</p>
        <p>She then proceeded to take on the jargon of the theorists. ''We all avow we speak for oppressed voices of class, race, gender, nationality; we don't 'interpret,' we 'intervene,' we don't 'analyze,' we 'interrogate.' . . . For the last 20 years this has been important, but is this all we have to offer as critics?'' We don't have to accept Bloom's Bardolatry, she said, the way Bloom puffs up the importance of a few Shakespearean characters to the point where ''Hamlet and Falstaff, inflated like the Sta-Puff Marshmallow Man in 'Ghostbusters,' stalk through our towns and cities.'' But, she insisted, ''it's time to get beyond the institutionalized debunking of the bourgeois autonomous or essentialist humanist self. The time to make a career beating that horse has passed.''</p>
        <p>There was a mixture of amused and nervous chuckles of appreciation around the room as her astonishingly frank self-critical monologue rose to a climax: ''Our institutionalized solidarity in bashing the 'bourgeois subject' has to some extent calcified us into an elite corps of yuppie guerrilla academics. . . . It's turned us into social moralists who increasingly prescribe correct and incorrect ways of understanding our objects of inquiry. If Bloom's right about anything it's this: the world doesn't give a fig for our critiques of its epistemology. Post-humanism may exist in the academy but it won't be found in the hearts and minds of the book-buying public. For at least in Bloom's zesty world there's some humor, some poignancy and some openly avowed love of art.''</p>
        <p>The love of art! Astonishing for a theorist to even utter such a retrograde formulation. But Charnes boldly wants to reclaim the love of art for a generation of theorists who she says have ''cleared the ground for Bloom by ceding the discussion of the aesthetic to him and his fellow reactionaries.'' Postmodern theorists have tended to demonize ''the aesthetic'' -- any discussion of beauty in art -- as a lure, a snare, a Trojan horse of the power structure to keep the oppressed distracted and deluded while the hierarchies of power in art like Shakespeare's brainwash them, turn them into slaves of the dread hegemony. In calling for a return to a concern for judgment, and for a focus on beauty and feeling, Charnes may, in fact, find common ground with Frank Kermode, who does something remarkable in his new book, ''Shakespeare's Language'': he finds a third way, the way of imperfection you might call it, that transcends the gulf between the Perfect Master of the Bardolaters and the Perfect Slave of the theorists.</p>
        <p>The distinctiveness of Kermode's approach, in fact the genesis of his new book, he told me in a phone interview from his office at Cambridge University, was his willingness to argue that some of Shakespeare, particularly some of the later, deeply knotted, compacted verse, simply failed to make sense. ''There's lots of what has to be called bad writing,'' Kermode said.</p>
        <p>Around 1600, in works like ''Hamlet'' and ''Measure for Measure,'' Kermode believes Shakespeare found a new way of representing the mind in the process of thinking. (This is not the same as Bloom's great claim that Shakespeare ''invented the human'' or created self-consciousness -- Kermode told me he regards such claims by Bloom as ''incense burning.'') But Kermode also believes that by 1608, beginning with ''Coriolanus,'' Shakespeare's language often becomes too fraught, too overwrought to bear the weight of the meaning he wants to load into it: ''He doesn't take the time to make it work.''</p>
        <p>The response of the idolaters to the knotted later verse has been to say that it's our fault, we are just not deep enough to penetrate into the mysteries that Shakespeare is trying to express. The response of the theorists is to say it's the fault of language itself. Kermode has the courage to suggest that it might be Shakespeare's fault.</p>
        <p>This, in fact, is an immensely liberating perspective because it licenses the return of aesthetic considerations Linda Charnes called for. A return to questions of value: How good is this passage or play, how do we judge it better or worse than something else in Shakespeare or in the work of other dramatists? How did Shakespeare achieve what he did at his best? It calls for the return of aesthetic judgments without incense burning, for a willingness to question why we think what is good is good. This might sound old-fashioned but, in fact, the convergence of Charnes's courageous critique of theory and Kermode's courageous critique of Shakespeare suggests this third way might be the future. Not a quaint return of the past, but something new: the post-postmodern, perhaps.</p>
