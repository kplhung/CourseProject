        <p>When a team has been where the Chicago Bears have recently been -- four straight losing seasons, a 6-10 record last year with a different offensive lineup starting each game and a defense ranked 29th -- help is required. The Bears have not been to the playoffs since 1994. Given the Bears' hefty history, that is a pitiful drought.</p>
        <p>In recent years, the Bears have trudged through turmoil in the front office, on the coaching staff and in personnel. A football team that makes passing its fancy is supposed to be a fun and exciting team. But though the Bears gained nearly 75 percent of their offense via passing last season and led the National Football League in passing attempts (684) and in completions (404), they were relatively ignored. The Bears changed quarterbacks five times last season.</p>

        <p>When a team has been where the Chicago Bears have recently been -- four straight losing seasons, a 6-10 record last year with a different offensive lineup starting each game and a defense ranked 29th -- help is required. The Bears have not been to the playoffs since 1994. Given the Bears' hefty history, that is a pitiful drought.</p>
        <p>In recent years, the Bears have trudged through turmoil in the front office, on the coaching staff and in personnel. A football team that makes passing its fancy is supposed to be a fun and exciting team. But though the Bears gained nearly 75 percent of their offense via passing last season and led the National Football League in passing attempts (684) and in completions (404), they were relatively ignored. The Bears changed quarterbacks five times last season.</p>
        <p>They arrived at Giants Stadium last night as a bunch most opponents would heartily welcome. Chicago had not won a preseason game on the road in three years, a span of five consecutive defeats.</p>
        <p>This was a good opening test for the Bears, tackling a Giants team that was only slightly better (7-9) last season than the Bears were. And the Bears mastered it, defeating the Giants, 20-8.</p>
        <p>The Bears have high hopes for this season. Consider that last season they lost by 1 point to Seattle, by 7 to Oakland, by 4 to Philadelphia, by 3 to Tampa Bay, by 3 to Minnesota and by 4 to Detroit. Victories in those games would have made the Bears a 12-4 team, instead of 6-10. For the Bears, to turn close losses into victories, help is required.</p>
        <p>Chicago gained a boost via free agency by acquiring defensive end Phillip Daniels from Seattle, cornerback Thomas Smith from Buffalo and safety Shawn Wooden from Miami. All three will start.</p>
        <p>But more help is required. If Chicago is to transform itself from a near-miss team to a winning one, it needs plenty of help from its rookies.</p>
        <p>Often in the N.F.L., rookies gain the chance to absorb and learn. Seldom are they asked to produce and lead. But that is exactly what the Bears require from their new crop. With it, the Bears can reach a .500 record or be slightly better and push for the playoffs. Without it, the Bears are staring at their fifth consecutive losing season.</p>
        <p>The Bears' top three draft picks are linebacker Brian Urlacher from New Mexico, safety Mike Brown from Nebraska and receiver Dez White from Georgia Tech. Chicago has other intriguing picks, including a seventh-rounder, kicker Paul Edinger from Michigan State. The initial trio, however, help form the backbone for a desired jolt.</p>
        <p>BRIAN URLACHER -- He played safety in college and at 6 feet 4 inches and 258 pounds was fast enough to keep pace with -- and tough enough to whack -- receivers and backs carrying the football. Scouts found his skills spellbinding in February at the combine in Indianapolis.</p>
        <p>Chicago made him the ninth pick in the draft, gave him No. 54 and made him an instant starter. He made his debut as a strongside linebacker last night and, impressively, he was in front of the defensive huddle calling the Bears' pre-snap sets occasionally early in the game.</p>
        <p>Imagine a stout defense like Tampa Bay's or even a solid one like the Giants' or even a green one like Cleveland's asking a rookie linebacker to do that.</p>
        <p>Urlacher has presence, toughness and mobility. He looked comfortable in his pro debut and he figures to be one of the most productive rookies in the N.F.L this season.</p>
        <p>''I just flew around and tried to make it happen,'' he said. ''I was making the calls for the defense in nickel situations and I don't even know all of the calls yet.''</p>
        <p>DEZ WHITE -- He began the night by dropping a 35-yard pass that could have easily been stretched for more. For much of the rest of the night, he faded into the scene.</p>
        <p>The Bears like his speed and playmaking ability, but it might be a while before he can change the course of a game. He will be helped most by big seasons from the Bears' other receivers, Marcus Robinson, Bobby Engram and Eddie Kennison. The more those players flourish, the more White can slip in and make an impact. In effect, the Bears are looking for White to help replace the flashy receiver Curtis Conway, who is now playing in San Diego.</p>
        <p>MIKE BROWN -- The first thing you notice about him is that he looks more like a fullback than a safety. He is 5-10, 210 pounds. Brown is a throwback compared to some of the league's more rangy, lanky safeties. But he can run, and he can hit. On a Giants' double-reverse run in the second quarter last night, it was Brown who made the tackle after a 17-yard gain to the Chicago 14. Most of the Bears flowed right and left, but Brown was able to gather himself, read the play well in front of him, position himself and make a hard, clean, definitive tackle. Nice. But how frequently will teams try to throw over the top on Brown? And can he consistently defend that type of pass in the N.F.L.?</p>
        <p>The Bears will find a tough road in 2000. Dick Jauron, their coach, is a sound and spirited leader, but they play in the N.F.C Central, where they are looking upward at Tampa Bay, Green Bay, Minnesota and Detroit. All four are better teams. Chicago's rookies could help to make it interesting and sometimes even fun. But over all, the Bears still need more help.</p>
