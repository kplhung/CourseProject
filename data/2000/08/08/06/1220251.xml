      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Alice Neel (1900-84) once said that had she not been an artist, she could have been a psychiatrist. Her psychological and artistic acumen are evident in the numerous portraits she painted during her six-decade career. ALICE NEEL (Abrams, $45), edited by Ann Temkin, a curator at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, underlines her commitment to portraiture, often despite changing trends in art. The book surveys Neel's range of subjects and unconventional approach to depicting children and families, along with her bold handling of sensitive subjects, from pregnant women to male frontal nudity. The essays present three portraits of the artist: as a woman seeking to forge meaningful connections between her art and personal life; as a product of the New Deal era who shared the democratic ideals of the Federal Art Project, in which Neel participated from 1935 to 1943; and as an opinionated chronicler of the New York art world in the 1960's and 70's, when she portrayed luminaries like Henry Geldzahler and Andy Warhol with a candor that has been compared to vivisection. Neel is also shown to be a keen social observer, who captured the gesture and dress of her day and achieved her declared goal of getting the ''person plus the zeitgeist.'' The composite view is rounded out with anecdotal accounts by sitters who posed for Neel and recall her working methods and tendencies, including talking incessantly during portrait sessions. What emerges from this study is the image of a colorful woman who unflinchingly bore witness to her age.</p>
