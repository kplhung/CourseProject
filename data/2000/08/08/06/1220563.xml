        <p>Letter from Andrew Stettner and Doris Busch-Boskey sees need for federal intervention to ensure justice in New York City, in light of some recent police killings</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In your coverage of the exoneration of the officer involved in the shooting of Patrick M. Dorismond (news articles, July 28 and 30), you note that four unarmed black men have been killed by New York police officers in the last 13 months. You do not mention the similarities with the killing of Gidone (Gary) Busch, an observant Jew in Borough Park, Brooklyn, who was shot and killed in front of his apartment by at least six police officers.</p>
        <p>In both cases, the mayor and the police commissioner repeatedly laid the blame on the victim, castigating both Gary and Mr. Dorismond as aggressors. In each incident, the true instigators were the police -- either through a belligerent buy-and-bust operation or, in Gary's case, the use of aggressive tactics on a man who witnesses say posed no threat.</p>

        <p>These two cases, along with the failed Diallo prosecution, demonstrate that federal intervention is our best hope for justice.</p>
