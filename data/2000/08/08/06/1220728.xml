        <p>The Los Alamos National Laboratory, where the atomic bomb was developed during World War II, has come  under investigation by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a federal civil rights agency. The agency is looking into possible discrimination against Asian and Asian-American scientists, some of whom have charged that security measures put in place after the arrest of Dr. Wen Ho Lee, a former Los Alamos scientist charged with mishandling nuclear data, have focused unfairly on them. The commission began a similar investigation of another weapons laboratory, Lawrence Livermore, last year.</p>
