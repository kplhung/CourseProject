      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>THE Yellow Victorian is a yellow-painted, gingerbread-accented 1880 frame house with white trim in Riverton, near the Massachusetts border. The house is charming, well suited to the attractive, tree-lined little town where Lambert Hitchcock built his first chair factory in 1826 and where reproductions are still being produced in the same building. Visitors to town should find the restaurant a snug little spot for lunch or dinner, before or after a tour of the chair factory showroom or a visit to the Hitchcock Museum. Meals are served in three small, homey rooms. In addition, there is one table in an entrance room that doubles as a gift shop and two more tables on the front porch.</p>
        <p>The cozy atmosphere is enhanced by a super-friendly, enthusiastic staff. After a lengthy drive, we looked forward to a leisurely dinner. The warm welcome of our waitress was augmented by the arrival of freshly made, warm and crusty bread, which arrived with big slabs of butter and our wine and beer orders.</p>

        <p>THE Yellow Victorian is a yellow-painted, gingerbread-accented 1880 frame house with white trim in Riverton, near the Massachusetts border. The house is charming, well suited to the attractive, tree-lined little town where Lambert Hitchcock built his first chair factory in 1826 and where reproductions are still being produced in the same building. Visitors to town should find the restaurant a snug little spot for lunch or dinner, before or after a tour of the chair factory showroom or a visit to the Hitchcock Museum. Meals are served in three small, homey rooms. In addition, there is one table in an entrance room that doubles as a gift shop and two more tables on the front porch.</p>
        <p>The cozy atmosphere is enhanced by a super-friendly, enthusiastic staff. After a lengthy drive, we looked forward to a leisurely dinner. The warm welcome of our waitress was augmented by the arrival of freshly made, warm and crusty bread, which arrived with big slabs of butter and our wine and beer orders.</p>
        <p>We began with steamed Prince Edward Island mussels in an aromatic broth of lemon, white wine, fresh dill and bits of chopped garlic, which we happily sopped up with the delicious bread. Alas, the mussels themselves were mostly too shriveled and half-formed to eat; they should have been discards. We fared better with smoked salmon with rye toast points and the classic accouterments of lemon, capers and shaved red onion, plus herb-crusted cream cheese.</p>
        <p>Pan-seared sea scallops lacked flavor and were barely browned, and the ''pineapple-kiwi salsa'' consisted of cubes of pineapple, with scant sign of kiwis and no salsa piquancy. Portobello mushroom with bits of sausage (a recited special) was an intriguing combination, but it arrived swimming in a bowl of pesto. Much as we savor this pungent Genoese sauce -- and this one had plenty of verve -- the huge quantity was overkill. Our most satisfying entree was saute veal cutlet, tender and lightly breaded, in a sauce of roasted shallots, white wine, diced fresh tomatoes and fresh Italian parsley. It was served, like most of our entrees, with basmati rice, broccoli and al dente miniature carrots.</p>
        <p>Sometimes the menu prose was more romance than reality. For instance, in the ''pecan-crusted catfish,'' the crust was really a plethora of toasted nuts sprinkled over and around the fish, which rested on a mattress of lightly dressed fresh greens. While the fish was moist and sweet-tasting, its beurre noisette (browned butter) had gone missing.</p>
        <p>Bay scallops Bellini, described as ''seared scallops accented with earthy shiitake and vegetable cream base,'' turned out to be pale, bland scallops with no evidence of having been seared, enveloped by a cream sauce with a few mushroom bits.</p>
        <p>Desserts are few but taste freshly made. Most memorable of the ones we eagerly devoured was a giant portion of chocolate crunch layer cake, an opulent creation of dark chocolate cake with milk chocolate frosting and whipped cream, surrounded by a pool of milky, delicate mocha sauce. White chocolate cheesecake was a fluffy addition to a standard cheesecake. A more appealing dish was the lemon coconut tartlets. Two petite round tarts,  stacked precariously on top of one another, sported zesty lemon flavor, foamy meringue covers and flaky coconut macaroon crusts.</p>
        <p>Dinner for two came to $63.30, before tax, tip or drinks. The wine list is eclectic, with bottle prices from $16.99, wines by the glass $4.50. There is also a wide assortment of soft drinks and juices.</p>
        <p>The efforts of an unusually amenable staff with a great willingness to please, the old-fashioned charisma of the Yellow Victorian house itself, and a menu that speaks of fresh ingredients and creative concepts (not always realized), all contribute to a relaxing mealtime stop at one of the quieter outposts of the state.</p>
