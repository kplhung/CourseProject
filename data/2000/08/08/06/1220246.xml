        <p>Ben, in the World</p>
        <p>The Sequel to ''The Fifth Child.''</p>
        <p>By Doris Lessing.</p>
        <p>178 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>HarperCollins Publishers. $23.</p>
        <p>You remember Ben: the monster born to a determinedly happy family in middle-class England, an ugly, murderous goblin, all muscle and appetite. He first appeared in Doris Lessing's 1988 novel, ''The Fifth Child.'' He might be a genetic throwback, an untimely Neanderthal, even nature's violent reaction to his family members' smug assumption that they can control their lives. He's much like the growing underclass they fear, happiest of all with the workless, shiftless kids who get into fighting and roaming and thieving. The root of the word ''monster,'' after all, is the Latin verb meaning ''to warn.''</p>
        <p>And Ben's arrival in the family does have terrible consequences. His proper, moral grandparents are ready to put him in an institution, where the death of such freaks is never quite deliberate or much delayed. His mother saves him from the straitjackets and hose baths, but at the cost of her family. Everything around him is in ruins. Ben goes on.</p>
        <p>''The Fifth Child'' is a spectacularly disturbing story: a woman's body invaded, a family under the constant, ominous watch of an alien. Parents see a metaphor here for the unmanageable strangers they seem to be raising. Adolescents identify too, since Ben represents all their differences rolled into one -- their ungainly, unloved, lonely selves. Ben's power also draws on our fears of</p>
        <p>a hooligan culture, of a fragile order threatened by a mob of marginal others, the dread of slipping backward in a world that can't live without progress.</p>
        <p>Ben's story is such a fine one, in fact, that it can be read a dozen ways -- as social commentary, allegory of parenthood or spiritual warning -- in which case it is subtler than some of Lessing's didactic science fiction. In the Sufism that she follows, as in other religions, there is a duty to control spite, anger, lust -- everything Ben personifies. But Ben, when he learns to manage such things, has no spiritual purpose; he does it only to survive. He is every obstacle to godliness, including an indifference to God.</p>
        <p>Or so it seems. But what Ben is, mostly, is a character who comes wrestling and reeking off the page, a monster whose humanity we must recognize when we least want to. We start off identifying with the nice family; we end up wanting to see the world through those goblin eyes. So ''Ben, in the World,'' which tells his other story, the one that belongs to him alone, is a most unusual kind of sequel: the absolutely necessary one.</p>
        <p>Ben is now 18, although he looks a musclebound 40. He is in the world, but not of it (which is a Sufi notion too). He has long been exiled from his family, living rough, always being tricked, not able to master the intricacies of filling out a form, let alone getting enough money to live on. He's dependent on the kindness of marginal people: an old pensioner living alone in a London tower block, a tart who likes his brute kind of sex. He loves to be told that he's good, but he knows everyone keeps asking as he passes: ''Who is he?'' ''What is he?''</p>
        <p>Ben is taken up by a gypsy-cab driver who needs a drug courier, a very innocent one, and then by a movie director who envisions an epic about surviving Neanderthals. He's abandoned on the Cte d'Azur, spirited to Brazil, kidnapped for a viciously inhuman research institute that sees him only as a specimen, rescued and taken to see ''my people,'' people like him. Discovering who they are and where they are and when they were is what triggers the novel's calamitous ending. There's no reason this should be plausible; Ben's story is a fable and therefore fabulous. The notion of Old Ones still among us could be a device from H. P. Lovecraft, but Lessing still takes quite extraordinary risks.</p>
        <p>In place of the claustrophobia of ''The Fifth Child,'' where the family house confines everyone, ''Ben, in the World'' is picaresque, replacing the domestic detail of the earlier book with exotic locations. Lessing deliberately anticipates at times, tells us what will happen before it happens; she is not pursuing conventional suspense. And Ben's humanity -- his kinship with us, which makes him so disturbing -- is diluted by the constant references to animal appetites, even by the plot device that reduces him to an experimental animal.</p>
        <p>You may also feel bullied when Lessing hangs out her values like flags -- the persistent virtue of the working classes and the beastliness of the bourgeoisie, the distaste for scientific certainty, some lofty patronizing of the poor (''children of wild places'' is an odd description for kids from the slums of Rio). You may think all this, and yet you will still cry, such is the conviction that underlies this subtle meditation on what could possibly happen to a creature like Ben. The sun hurts his eyes; you flinch. He dances for joy, just once, at the hope of finding people like him, and your sympathy is painful. He is more poignant than Frankenstein's monster just because he has hope. At times, Lessing's spare, sharp prose lets you see things as Ben sees them, as you have not seen things before. The book shares that uncanny effect with the best fiction.</p>
