      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Benjamin Zucker's first novel, BLUE (Overlook, $40), is at once a spiritual challenge and a gorgeous typographical object. Echoing the style of the Talmud, the book presents a continuing narrative in the center of each right-hand page, where a passage from the Mishna -- ancient commentary on the Torah -- would ordinarily be placed. The protagonist of this core text, a New York gem merchant named Abraham Tal, specializes in giving advice to others. Unfortunately, he appears to be incapable of taking decisive action in his own life, most notably in the matter of setting a date to marry Rachel Beller, his girlfriend of many years. He is constantly at odds with his brother and partner, Tuviah, in a sibling rivalry that recalls numerous biblical antecedents. The central story is wreathed with commentaries, including those of Abe's mother and father, the impatient Rachel and a host of others both living and dead: Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, Chief Crazy Horse, Modigliani, Isaac Luria, Bob Dylan and dozens more. Their remarks all begin with a word or phrase taken from the main text; the words attributed to them are a mixture of direct quotations, in italics, and the author's expertly constructed inventions of what they might have said. The left-hand pages all bear illustrations -- dazzling reproductions of Vermeers and Van Goghs, photographs of Kafka, Talmudic texts -- that preside over the profusion of stories, judgments and opinions on the facing pages. More than a novel, ''Blue'' may in fact be a collective meditation on character. Is Abraham Tal's inaction wrong, or is he merely waiting for something as yet unannounced? Is he a coward, or simply a man seduced by a vision of the infinite? The color blue, whether in a painting by Monet, Kafka's ''blue notebooks'' or the amazing 204-carat sapphire that graces the book's jacket, functions as a symbol of eternity. In the struggle to comprehend a secular life that somehow and always includes the divine, these many commentators, like Luria and his fellow cabalists in the holy city of Safed, all seem to be ''floating in their own prayer.''</p>
