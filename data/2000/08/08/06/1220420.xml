        <p>Tyler Hill was teeing off at the first hole, a grudge match with his brother and his father.</p>
        <p>Neither one was much watching him, though. Their heads were turned to the small Cherokee with an open cockpit taking off not 100 yards behind them, and then whipsawing to look at an attractive woman in a bikini who was walking by.</p>
        <p>Presumably, Tiger Woods never had the distractions that 8-year-old Tyler had last Saturday afternoon. But then, Mr. Woods has never played the Ocean City Municipal Golf Course, in all likelihood the only 12-hole golf course in the country and one of few bordered on one side by an airport and three blocks from a jam-packed beach.</p>
        <p>Legend has it, says the city's director of recreation, Mike Allegretto, that the course -- built in 1957 just as the post-World War II building boom was billowing in earnest at this no-alcohol family-oriented resort just south of Atlantic City -- was rushed to completion that summer with only 12 holes because that is all that were ready.</p>
        <p>''I was about 10 years old when they did it,'' said Mr. Allegretto, who took over responsibility for the golf course this spring. ''Then I guess it was like any other city project. You get going and then you lose steam, and then sometimes, you don't get to the final phase of it.''</p>
        <p>Eventually, the land near 26th Street and Bay Avenue, where the golf course entrance is situated, was put to other uses. A recycling center and soccer fields, instead of six more golf holes, now lie west of the existing 12 holes.</p>
        <p>Curiously -- jutting only a few yards behind a swath of marsh grass along the 8th, 9th and 10th holes -- is the runway for the Ocean City Municipal Airport. Built in part for commercial and military dirigible traffic along the coast as a Works Progress Administration project during the Great Depression in 1935, the airport now parks as many as 100 small planes on a summer weekend. It costs $7 to park a plane there 24 hours, although the fee is refunded if the golf course is played.</p>
        <p>''Theoretically, you can fly in, play a round of golf, walk to the beach and fly out,'' said Mr. Allegretto. ''Some people do actually do that. It's a good day, I would think.''</p>
        <p>A small pro shop is connected to the airport waiting room by a winding corridor. Go through another door in the waiting room and you come to the Airport Diner, a restaurant with 50 seats that boasts the ''best breakfast at the shore.''</p>
        <p>''An all-purpose friendly place,'' said Mr. Allegretto.</p>
        <p>Indeed, complaints about exorbitant prices are rare here. Complete breakfasts at the diner include creamed chip beef with home fries for $5.50 and a large stack of French toast for $4.50. Ocean City golf shirts go for only $11, golf umbrellas $9.</p>
        <p>But the real bargain is the golf. A round -- 12 holes, remember -- costs $9, and $7 for those over 62 and under 19 on weekdays. It costs $5 to rent clubs and a bag (emblazoned RENTAL in two-foot-high letters to thwart theft). There are two carts that can be rented, though Mr. Allegretto says the 1,560-yard layout is not much of a strain. A 10-play pass is $75.</p>
        <p>Russell Hill was getting his 10-play pass punched for himself and his sons, Tyler, 8, and Stephen, 10. The Hills stay about three blocks from the course on summer weekends, and while none of them profess to be a great golfers, all like coming to Ocean City Municipal.</p>
        <p>''It's good for the kids, even if it can be slow when it's crowded,'' said Mr. Hill. ''Frankly, I come here because its the only place I can par a hole.''</p>
        <p>Ocean City Municipal plays to a par 37, which means that all holes except the 235-yard 10th, which has a bit of marsh surrounding it, are a par 3. The first hole, in fact, going from the airport runway east to just short of Bay Avenue, is only 60-yards long.</p>
        <p>''Even I use a pitching wedge on that one,'' said Mr. Allegretto, who gives golf lessons during the school year through the recreation department, and admits to having once played a par round there. Even novices are unlikely to use a wood on the course, except for perhaps the par-four 10th hole. The bag of rental clubs includes only a 3-, 5- and 7-iron, a wedge and a putter.</p>
        <p>But it is the coziness of the course that attracts Rich Dominico and his son, Richie Jr., 16.</p>
        <p>''We come down for vacation for a week and we get to play twice or so,'' said the elder Mr. Dominico. ''It's great. Instead of driving somewhere and taking five or six hours to play, well be done here in two and a half hours and be on the beach a half-hour later.''</p>
        <p>Richie Jr. added: ''When you're on vacation, you want to do a lot of things. Ocean City is a place where you can do everything.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Allegretto said the course more or less ran itself, and he got few complaints, though he would like to hire someone next summer to give lessons. Because the course is so close to Bay Avenue and the runway, large nets are suspended from utility poles to protect passing vehicles.</p>
        <p>''We just want to be safe,'' said Mr. Allegretto, ''though we haven't had anyone slice one into an airplane taking off yet.''</p>
