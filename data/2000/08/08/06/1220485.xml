        <p>Many readers responded to Peter Applebome's July 23 Soapbox column about racial mores and suburban manners at a gas station in Westchester County. The problem the column posed was what, if anything, to say to or do about the black gentleman sharing his expletive-laden music with the world and also Mr. Applebome's 9-year-old daughter.</p>
        <p>Here is a sampling of readers' reactions.</p>
        <p>At that moment when you looked over your shoulder at the distraction, you had already made your decision that this was not music that you wanted your child to be exposed to even for a few minutes. Common sense says drivers can wait until they get back on the highway to blast music and they will hurt (or offend, in this case) no one. Whether it was rap or country western makes no difference to me. Loud is loud.</p>

        <p>Here is a sampling of readers' reactions.</p>
        <p>At that moment when you looked over your shoulder at the distraction, you had already made your decision that this was not music that you wanted your child to be exposed to even for a few minutes. Common sense says drivers can wait until they get back on the highway to blast music and they will hurt (or offend, in this case) no one. Whether it was rap or country western makes no difference to me. Loud is loud.</p>
        <p>The fact that it was a large black man or a rich kid from Greenwich should not have prevented you from speaking your mind (politely, I would hope). Not doing so because of race is racism in itself. But not the racism we read about or see on the news; it's a racism that is more damaging to the inner self. This form of inner racism prevents one from following the basic tenets he/she believes in (religious or common sense on my part). This is sad.</p>
        <p>Whether it's complaining about loud music or inviting a new acquaintance to your home or giving to the poor or respecting the other person, we must all learn to look at the person. Not the other thing.</p>
