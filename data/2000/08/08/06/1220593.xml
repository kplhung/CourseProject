        <p>A column July 23 by Peter Applebome described a situation at a gas station in which he and his 9-year-old daughter were exposed to loud rap music with X-rated lyrics booming from the car of a black man wearing a prison guard uniform. He debated asking the man to turn the music down but decided not to. He asked readers what they would do. Here is a sampling of the many responses.</p>
        <p>I would have done nothing, I am sure. But then again, my daughter is almost 12, and there is a song (the revolting ''Slim Shady'') like the one you described that is her favorite because of the bouncy rhythm and the nasty words and because I don't like it. But all the middle school kids think it is fabulous to reject the norms of their parents and are busy memorizing the lyrics. What could I possibly say when the song is on my car radio too?</p>
