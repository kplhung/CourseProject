        <p>THE wave of economic reforms that has washed over Latin America first touched shore in Chile. That small nation, with an economy roughly the size of New Jersey's, was the first to tear down import barriers, liberalize exchange-rate policy, bolster the domestic savings rate and otherwise whip itself into shape for the new global economy.</p>
        <p>Now it wants to go further.</p>
        <p>Chile already has the highest bond ratings of any Latin American country. Its finances are impeccable, and it has remained stable even during regional crises. A recession last year was its first in 16 years; it is now on track to springing back to 6 percent growth. Perhaps most vividly, Chile has managed in the last decade to cut by half the number of its people who live in poverty.</p>
        <p>Problems remain, of course, but even so, other nations in the region look to Chile as a shining example. Mexican leaders seem particularly enchanted. President Ernesto Zedillo based his reform of Mexico's social security system on the Chilean model, which lets workers contribute to individual retirement accounts. And Mr. Zedillo's successor, Vicente Fox, wants Chilean-style changes that lower corporate taxes when profits are reinvested locally.</p>
        <p>Despite all that, there were a few moments of economic uncertainty before Chile's presidential elections in January. Voters and investors wondered whether a new president -- particularly a Socialist candidate like Ricardo Lagos, who won -- might stunt or even reverse some of that much-admired record.</p>
        <p>The uncertainty did not last long and, in hindsight, it appears that there was never much to worry about. There may be a lesson in that: New administrations in the region, no matter their political leanings, have scant leeway to radically change economic policy.</p>
        <p>''It's true -- there is very little in terms of sound market-dominated economic policy and market-oriented resource allocation that any new president can change,'' said Nicolas Eyzaguirre, Chile's minister of finance. While some tinkering is possible, no country that has bought into a system that relies on free trade and open borders can easily afford to back out.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox's victory in Mexico may be a good example. Although he campaigned against almost everything that the Institutional Revolutionary Party stood for, his promise of sweeping change did not extend to economic policy. He says he wants to put a human face on the economy, but his background as an entrepreneur and former head of Coca-Cola of Mexico actually put him closer to the free-market ideas of Mr. Zedillo, an economist, than was the ruling party's own candidate, Francisco Labastida, a former state governor with a populist bent.</p>
        <p>IN Chile, Mr. Lagos seems committed not only to continuing economic liberalization but also to making a course change even more difficult. Advisers say he is preparing to introduce a reform package that would remove the temptation to fool with the economy for short-term political gain.</p>
        <p>The new laws would mandate an average 1 percent surplus in the structural balance, or what public finances would be like if the economy was at or near full employment. On a theoretical level, this is a mechanism to take account of cyclical conditions. In practical terms, it puts the Chilean president in a fiscal straitjacket.</p>
        <p>Mr. Eyzaguirre said recent problems in Asia and Russia, as well as the Mexican peso crisis in 1995, were set off not by unsound policies but by the inconsistent way that sound policies were administered. The rules that Chile is considering would pre-empt much of the chief executive's discretion. ''We want to arrive at a position where macroeconomic policy is not just sound,'' Mr. Eyzaguirre said. ''It is based on rules.''</p>
        <p>Chile's proud record has a glaring omission: The Clinton administration has not kept a promise to bring Chile into the North American Free Trade Agreement. A leery Congress denied President Clinton the fast-track authority needed to negotiate the deal.</p>
        <p>Chile's disappointment is unmistakable. ''We put our house in order and then we put our house in order even further,'' Mr. Eyzaguirre said. ''We thought this would be an easy marriage.''</p>
        <p>Being jilted by Washington has given Chile incentive to pursue other deals. It has signed its own trade pacts with Canada and Mexico, the other parties of Nafta, and is working on others with the European Union, South Korea and perhaps Japan.</p>
        <p>So now it is Chile that is looking to Washington for a policy change that might revive trade talks. ''We are waiting for a new administration to give signals,'' Mr. Eyzaguirre said. ''But the experience so far has not been brilliant.''</p>
