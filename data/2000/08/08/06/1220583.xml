        <p>After the malfunction of a Ferris wheel last summer at the annual Fireman's Carnival in Mahopac, a father, godfather and grandfather have sued firefighters and officials in the Sheriff's Department. The suit, filed in State Supreme Court in Carmel, contends that a deputy sheriff used excessive force when he tried to stop the plaintiffs -- Michael Barile, Michael Bunyea and William LaScala -- from entering the firehouse to search for Mr. Bunyea's 12-year-old daughter, Nicole, who had been on the ride but was not injured. The suit says the deputy sheriff threw Mr. Bunyea against a firetruck and onto the ground. Mr. Barile is Nicole's godfather, and Mr. LaScala is her grandfather. The men were charged with assault after trying to enter the firehouse. Although all charges were dropped, the plaintiff's lawyer, Joseph J. Tock, said the arrests damaged their reputations. They are seeking $21 million in damages.</p>
