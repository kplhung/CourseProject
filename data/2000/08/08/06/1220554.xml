        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re your Aug. 3 news article about former Prime Minister Charles J. Haughey of Ireland, who is the focus of an inquiry about suspected corruption:</p>
        <p>You relate the tale of someone who achieved political success after years in political isolation. But the article also shows an all-too-often occurrence of such a person's using a leadership position for personal gain.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re your Aug. 3 news article about former Prime Minister Charles J. Haughey of Ireland, who is the focus of an inquiry about suspected corruption:</p>
        <p>You relate the tale of someone who achieved political success after years in political isolation. But the article also shows an all-too-often occurrence of such a person's using a leadership position for personal gain.</p>
        <p>Mr. Haughey is described as having a ''regal bearing'' and as someone who ''fancies himself as quite a bit of an emperor.'' But in Ireland, or in any democracy, there can be no ruling class. Politicians and political parties exist to carry out the hopes of the people. When those in government view public service as a means to private wealth, they betray the people.</p>
        <p>Ireland has economic prosperity, yet it also requires a wealth of integrity. There is a danger that the ''Celtic Tiger'' may create an economically partitioned society. Ireland must find a new generation of leaders whose concept of personal enrichment is to gain the trust and respect of the people.</p>
        <p>DANIEL J. DONOVAN  Brooklyn, Aug. 3, 2000</p>
