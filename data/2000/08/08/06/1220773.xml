        <p>RESNICK-Muriel. On July 26, 2000, having recently celebrated her 80th birthday surrounded by her family. Totally devoted to her husband of 60 years, Spike (Dr. Herman) and her daughter, Amy. She was a wonderful sister, aunt, grandmother, great-grandmother and friend to many. She kept us laughing and we can only assume she's up there in heaven raising some hell. For information on her burial, call Margo at 713-385-6764.</p>
