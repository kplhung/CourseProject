        <p>New York and Connecticut lobstermen are not alone in fearing that their precious resource is being threatened by man-made contaminants. Maine, the nation's largest lobster source, has not suffered the alarming die-off that decimated the Long Island Sound lobster fishery this spring, but Maine fishermen, environmentalists and town officials have seen enough red flags to voice their concerns.</p>
        <p>In April, Maine's Department of Transportation announced plans to dump dredge spoils contaminated with lead, mercury, PCB's and petroleum derivatives, into the prime lobster grounds of Penobscot Bay. The proposed disposal site, five miles from Vinalhaven, Me., an island about 50 miles northeast of Portland, lies within an area where 19 million pounds of lobster were caught last year -- nearly 40 percent of the state landings.</p>
        <p>When Penobscot Bay lobstermen and community leaders heard about the dumping proposal, they came out in force to protest.</p>
        <p>''I'm not a scientist,'' said Vinalhaven's town manager, Sue Lessard, looking at the Transportation Department's plan. ''But I'm intelligent enough to know this is not a good idea.''</p>
        <p>Although the causes of the Long Island Sound disaster remain uncertain -- last week, New York area lobstermen blamed pesticide spraying -- some scientists believe contaminated dredge spoils played a role. Consequently, Maine fishermen have asked regulators to find new ways to dump dredge material.</p>
        <p>Maine's Transportation Department did not expect any opposition when it applied for its dredge material disposal permit, part of a port redevelopment project at Mack Point, in upper Penobscot Bay. At an April hearing on the application, Paul Pottle, the department's project manager, told the public that the permit called for dumping 121,000 cubic yards of dredge material and that the contaminated material would be left at the site.</p>
        <p>Lessard, armed with facts, caught Pottle off guard when she took issue with his statements.</p>
        <p>''I obtained copies of the permits being applied for,'' Lessard told Pottle, ''and I'm a little confused as to what I've heard.'' Lessard said the application asked to dispose 375,000 cubic yards of material at the Rockland, Me. site, at least 50,000 cubic yards of it contaminated.</p>
        <p>Lessard also pointed out that federal rules required the Rockland site to be monitored every 10 years and that it had not been monitored since 1989. She, and many others, said that they did not object to the Mack Point port project, only the proposed disposal of the dredge spoils. They called for a review of the Rockland site before any future dumping.</p>
        <p>The Mack Point project, high on Gov. Angus King's list of priorities, has ''a lot of political will behind it,'' Lessard said. ''If it's a state mission to build this port, we want it handled responsibly,'' she said.</p>
        <p>In Vinalhaven, where 75 percent of the year-round residents depend on the lobster industry for their livelihood, it comes as no surprise that a furor over the disposal of dredge spoils spread in coastal areas and led to another meeting in late April. State and federal officials addressed the concerns of Vinalhaven and other Maine fishing communities.</p>
        <p>Carl Boutilier of the New England office of the United States Army Corps of Engineers said the disposal site off Vinalhaven was scheduled for review this year. ''We'll be seeking input from fishermen on how best to conduct the site evaluation in order to address their concerns,'' he said, but he added that the results might not affect the Mack Point project.</p>
        <p>Peter Jones, owner of the Vinalhaven Lobster Company, suggested that a review of the Rockland site should lead to the end of dumping. ''We don't want another Long Island Sound,'' he said. ''We need to close the Rockland site permanently.''</p>
        <p>Maine's commissioner of marine resources, George Lapointe, urged fishermen and community leaders to work with the state to find solutions to Mack Point and future dredge disposal issues. ''Let's get the facts on the table,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He noted that ''dumping had occurred at the Rockland disposal site since the 50's, concomitant with the largest increase in lobster landings in Maine history.'' Lobster landings have increased to 53 million pounds from 22 million pounds in the last 50 years.</p>
        <p>With dredge material from Mack Point and several harbor maintenance projects scheduled to go to the Rockland disposal site, Maine's transportation commissioner, John Melrose, asked fishermen to consider the economic repercussions of closing the area's only ocean disposal site.</p>
        <p>''One thing that's left me sort of unsettled is that much of the discussion has been focused on the lobster resource,'' Melrose said. ''You need to consider what will happen to other projects.''</p>
        <p>Ocean dumping of contaminated dredge spoils has become a nationwide problem, and Melrose acknowledged that ''the long-term prospects for doing business as usual are not good.'' But for the short term, he expressed worries that if the Rockland dump closes, the rising cost of dredge spoil disposal might shut down marine activity in Maine.</p>
        <p>The Transportation Department estimates that each ship entering a Maine port generates $40,000 to $74,000 for local communities. In addition, the Mack Point port would link shipping with rail service to northern Maine, Montreal and maritime Canada, providing goods to those areas and export opportunities for the region's forest products.</p>
        <p>Leroy Bridges, president of the Downeast Lobstermen's Association, countered that Maine's $70 million lobster industry also contributed to the state's economy and the tourist industry. ''People don't come to Maine to see ships unloading,'' he said. ''They come to eat lobster, and see us catching them.''</p>
        <p>Lance Stewart, a University of Connecticut marine biologist who has studied the effects of dredge disposal on lobsters for decades, believes the lobsters in Long Island Sound succumbed to a number of stresses, including pesticide spraying and rising water temperature. ''Although dredge spoils may be having some impact, they are not at the top of my list as far as the cause of the die-off,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Bob Bayer, executive director of the University of Maine-affiliated Lobster Institute, agrees that anything that will kill an insect will kill a lobster, but he remains cautious. ''We still worry about dredge spoils,'' he said. Many Long Island Sound lobstermen had lost boats and homes, Bayer said, as a result of the economic repercussions of the crisis. ''Is it worth the risk?'' he asked.</p>
        <p>Seeking a resolution of conflicting interests, Bridges, Lessard and representatives from several advocacy groups met with state officials on June 13. The meeting resulted in some progress, but the situation remains tentative, said Ben Neal of the Island Institute in Rockland.</p>
        <p>''M.D.O.T. agreed to consider reducing the total volume on its application to 75,000 cubic yards and find an upland disposal site for the contaminated material,'' he said. ''I think it's good that people are talking, but the jury is still out on what level of commitment M.D.O.T. has.''</p>
        <p>Lessard said she believed the department ''is cognizant of our concerns and is trying to compromise.'' She added, however, that nothing had yet been put in writing.</p>
        <p>Melrose, the transportation commissioner, is hopeful that affordable ways can be found to use contaminated material, possibly in the construction at Mack Point. But dredge material will continue to be generated by other projects, and Melrose wants to avoid future conflicts.</p>
        <p>To that end, the Army Corps of Engineers and Maine agencies, including the Transportation Department, have set to work with various individuals and groups to create a long-range plan balancing environmental and economic interests.</p>
        <p>Lessard and Bridges have faith in the negotiations. But economic realities continue to drive the Mack Point project, and contaminated dredge material could still legally be dumped in waters off Vinalhaven.</p>
        <p>''It's important we don't go down that road,'' Lessard said. ''There's way too much at stake.''</p>
