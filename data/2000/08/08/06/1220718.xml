        <p>Coach Al Groh was biting off his words Friday night, seething at the Jets' 37-24 defensive self-destruction against the Packers at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wis. The 409 yards of offense allowed, the missed tackles and the touchdowns on which Marcus Coleman and Aaron Glenn of the Jets were torched were all thrown into Groh's caldron of criticism.</p>
        <p>Groh looked at film of the preseason game yesterday morning and his assessment had softened only slightly. ''It wasn't so much mistakes as execution,'' Groh said. ''There were a number of positions where the execution wasn't quite what it had been in preceding days.''</p>

        <p>Coach Al Groh was biting off his words Friday night, seething at the Jets' 37-24 defensive self-destruction against the Packers at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wis. The 409 yards of offense allowed, the missed tackles and the touchdowns on which Marcus Coleman and Aaron Glenn of the Jets were torched were all thrown into Groh's caldron of criticism.</p>
        <p>Groh looked at film of the preseason game yesterday morning and his assessment had softened only slightly. ''It wasn't so much mistakes as execution,'' Groh said. ''There were a number of positions where the execution wasn't quite what it had been in preceding days.''</p>
        <p>Groh did not have to elaborate, although he conceded that much of the Packers' 196 yards rushing had come in the second half when there were a lot of substitutions and the defense's cohesion suffered.</p>
        <p>Coleman was burned in the second quarter when Packer quarterback Matt Hasselbeck, looking more like Brett Favre than Favre did on Friday night, threw a pass toward the left corner of the end zone.</p>
        <p>The rookie receiver Charles Lee, a seventh-round pick from Central Florida, was stride for stride with Coleman until about the 10-yard line. Lee accelerated, leaving Coleman behind, and made an over-the-shoulder catch for a 31-yard touchdown.</p>
        <p>Earlier, Glenn could not break up a 15-yard touchdown pass from Hasselbeck to Donald Driver.</p>
        <p>Hoping to Be Hit</p>
        <p>Quarterback Vinny Testaverde emerged from his two games without so much as a splat of dirt on his uniform, and the Jets' offensive line was one of the few units that earned unmitigated praise from Coach Al Groh.</p>
        <p>Testaverde has looked superb. He is 10 of 18 for 234 yards in two games, but he is still waiting for his first contact of the season.</p>
        <p>''I'm actually losing sleep over it,'' he said. ''One of the things you go through before games, preparing for a game, is when you get out on the field, the contact you'll have, especially when it's been a whole year. So I look forward to that.''</p>
        <p>Rookies Will Be Rookies</p>
        <p>Friday's game was meant to feature the rookies in the intense atmosphere of Lambeau Field. After nearly universal acclaim after the Jets' victory over the New Orleans Saints last weekend, the rookies seemed more like, well, rookies. Tight end Anthony Becht, in his first start, did not have a catch. Receiver Laveranues Coles had three receptions but dropped two very catchable balls. Coach Al Groh attributed Coles's sloppiness to a lack of endurance; he was also returning kickoffs.</p>
        <p>The pass rush was mostly silent, although linebacker John Abraham had one sack and four tackles, and defensive end Shaun Ellis, in his first start, had three tackles.</p>
        <p>Receiver Windrell Hayes, who had a miserable game against the Saints,  was relieved of his punt-return duties, at least temporarily, in favor of Dedric Ward and the rookie Tony Scott. Groh said Hayes was not out of the mix for returning punts. Hayes had a marvelous night offensively, catching 5 passes for 52 yards, including a 22-yard reception from Chad Pennington during the Jets' two-minute drill at the end of the first half.</p>
        <p>''I like the way he went inside to get the ball in the two-minute situation,'' Groh said.</p>
        <p>Pennington continues to show impressive poise, although Groh said Friday night that there was no chance he could bump Ray Lucas from the backup job.</p>
        <p>Pennington was 7 of 11 for 136 yards and led the Jets to two touchdowns in the three drives he directed.</p>
        <p>Scott, who is also competing at cornerback, faced two punts, returning one for 9 yards and calling for a fair catch on the other.</p>
        <p>''I thought he did a good job on both of them,'' Groh said. ''He was pretty gutty throughout.</p>
        <p>''There's a little bit of the same kind of bravado needed to be a punt return man as what's important to be a corner.''</p>
        <p>Job Is Still Open</p>
        <p>Al Groh said nobody has moved ahead in the race for the free safety spot. Scott Frost will start next week against Baltimore. . . . Receiver Yatil Green finally entered the game in the third quarter but did not have a reception. He is zero for the preseason.</p>
