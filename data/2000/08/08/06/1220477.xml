        <p>Many readers responded to Peter Applebome's July 23 Soapbox column about racial mores and suburban manners at a gas station in Westchester County. The problem the column posed was what, if anything, to say to or do about the black gentleman sharing his expletive-laden music with the world and also Mr. Applebome's 9-year-old daughter.</p>
        <p>Here is a sampling of readers' reactions.</p>
        <p>If your true concern was in protecting your 9-year-old from profanity, you could have done the simple thing and just moved on to the next gas pump.</p>
