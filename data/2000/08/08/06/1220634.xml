        <p>A senior official of the Council of Europe has warned Belarus that the human rights body will refuse to send observers for parliamentary elections planned in October if the government of President Alexander G. Lukashenko fails to ensure that the vote is free and fair.</p>
        <p>''We are very, very disappointed by the apparent lack of progress in creating adequate conditions necessary for holding free and fair elections in Belarus,'' Terry Davis, the chairman of the council's political affairs committee, said in Minsk, the capital of Belarus, on Friday.</p>

        <p>A senior official of the Council of Europe has warned Belarus that the human rights body will refuse to send observers for parliamentary elections planned in October if the government of President Alexander G. Lukashenko fails to ensure that the vote is free and fair.</p>
        <p>''We are very, very disappointed by the apparent lack of progress in creating adequate conditions necessary for holding free and fair elections in Belarus,'' Terry Davis, the chairman of the council's political affairs committee, said in Minsk, the capital of Belarus, on Friday.</p>
        <p>''The consequence of our disappointment is that we will not recommend to the Council of Europe to send observers to the elections.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis said that a final decision on whether European governments would send observers would be made Aug. 30.</p>
        <p>A decision to withhold observers would further alienate Mr. Lukashenko's authoritarian government and deepen the political crisis in the country of 10 million, where opposition parties clashed with security forces in large demonstrations last spring.</p>
        <p>Since Mr. Lukashenko, a former collective farm manager, won election in 1994 with an overwhelming majority, his original nationalistic appeal and charismatic sway over the electorate have devolved into repression of political opponents.</p>
        <p>The Foreign Ministry of Belarus issued a statement calling Mr. Davis's conclusions ''unjust and biased.'' The Council of Europe delegation ''might have seen positive changes that have occurred lately had they really wanted to see them,'' the statement added.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Lukashenko has prepared for the elections, opposition leaders have been subjected to arrest and prosecution on charges relating to their political activities, leaving them barred from participating in the vote. Some opposition leaders have simply disappeared.</p>
        <p>''We are deeply concerned by reports of human rights violations and continued persecution and harassment for political reasons, including sentences and imprisonment of potential opposition candidates,'' Mr. Davis said. ''In the next 27 days, we will watch Belarus.''</p>
        <p>Belarussian opposition parties are threatening to boycott the elections if demands such as having their representatives join electoral commissions across the country are not met.</p>
