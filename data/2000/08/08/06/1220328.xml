        <p>'STEPHEN HOUGH'S NEW PIANO ALBUM'  Stephen Hough, pianist. Hyperion CDA 67043; CD.</p>
        <p>The English pianist Stephen Hough has made many fine records but none as cherishable as his collections of short parlor pieces. This is his third foray into the genre and is, if anything, even more rewarding than his previous efforts.</p>
        <p>As before, the pianist mixes old favorites by past masters like Godowsky, Chaminade and Rachmaninoff with works he has arranged or even written himself. But more than good programming distinguishes this package.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hough is a pianist of considerable technical polish and panache, and he uses his talents to good advantage here. His limpid tone in Godowsky's arrangement of Schubert's ''Morgengruss,'' his pointillistic turn in Moszkowski's ''Etincelles'' and the gentle ache he effortlessly evokes in Paderewski's Melody in G flat all work toward establishing this music's merit.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the pianist's original creations, surely the best evidence of his dedication to the form, don't match the brilliance of the older works, though his ''Etude de Concert'' proves an engaging fleet-fingered exercise. More persuasive are Mr. Hough's arrangements of two chestnuts by Richard Rodgers: a tender, filigreed version of ''Hello Young Lovers'' and a haunting, increasingly percussive account of ''Carousel Waltz.''</p>
        <p>Four Tchaikovsky items close the album, including Earl Wild's jazzy take on a pas de quatre from ''Swan Lake'' and a titanic paraphrase of ''Sleeping Beauty'' originally devised by Eugene Pabst and reworked by Mr. Hough.</p>
