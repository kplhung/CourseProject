        <p>Everyone else had a cow. Why not the South Bronx?</p>
        <p>When the ''Cow Parade'' rolled into New York in March, directors of the Point, a Hunts Point community organization, wanted to get one of the fiberglass cows for themselves.</p>
        <p>The group's effort began with the usual bovine banter: ''I wrote and said I had a beef with them,'' said Paul Lipson, the group's executive director. ''I told them Bronx artists would stampede their offices.''</p>
        <p>But months passed without reply.</p>
        <p>Finally, on July 26, a truck pulled up to the Point. Inside was the coveted cow. The organization's directors placed it outside their building.</p>
        <p>But the following Monday, Mr. Lipson got a call from the Bronx borough parks commissioner, William T. Castro. According to Mr. Castro, the police had called him to inquire about a stolen cow. Were any missing from the other boroughs? Because, the police said, the one in Hunts Point looked quite out of place.</p>
        <p>''There have been some cases of cattle rustling, apparently,'' Mr. Lipson said. ''But I assured him that wasn't the case here.''</p>
        <p>While there are hundreds of fiberglass cows in the Manhattan herd of the ''Cow Parade,'' only a few roam in the outer boroughs. Robert Lawson, a spokesman for the Parks Department, which is coordinating the project, said the Bronx had only five cows, only one of which is in the South Bronx.</p>
        <p>''For this cow, it took considerable effort just crossing the Harlem River,'' said Parks Commissioner Henry Stern, who learned of the (not) stolen cow last week. ''But the cow is a happy cow, and we know now that the police will keep an eye on her.''</p>
        <p>As for fitting in, Mr. Lipson said, ''I am happy to report that our cow has not been molested or moved or even tipped.''</p>
