        <p>Nobody writes about the bad old days down South like James Lee Burke. ''I remember the slot and racehorse machines, their chromium and electric glitter among the potted palms in the old Frederic Hotel on Main Street, and the cribs on each side of the train tracks that ran the length of Railroad Avenue,'' he tells us in PURPLE CANE ROAD (Doubleday, $24.95), capturing in a single sentence the feeling of the undead, only-sleeping past that keeps stirring to life in his crime novels.</p>
        <p>His Louisiana sheriff's deputy, Dave Robicheaux, doesn't need much of a mental shove to bring to mind Vachel Carmouche, the state executioner who sent many a prisoner to glory (or damnation) until Letty Labiche chopped him up on the kitchen floor for having abused her and her twin sister, Passion, since childhood. Now Letty is about to die in Angola, and everyone from a 20-year-old prostitute named Little Face Dautrieve to Belmont Pugh, the governor, is begging Robicheaux to get her off. To add to his incentive, two corrupt cops who figure in the case might also have killed his mother.</p>

        <p>Nobody writes about the bad old days down South like James Lee Burke. ''I remember the slot and racehorse machines, their chromium and electric glitter among the potted palms in the old Frederic Hotel on Main Street, and the cribs on each side of the train tracks that ran the length of Railroad Avenue,'' he tells us in PURPLE CANE ROAD (Doubleday, $24.95), capturing in a single sentence the feeling of the undead, only-sleeping past that keeps stirring to life in his crime novels.</p>
        <p>His Louisiana sheriff's deputy, Dave Robicheaux, doesn't need much of a mental shove to bring to mind Vachel Carmouche, the state executioner who sent many a prisoner to glory (or damnation) until Letty Labiche chopped him up on the kitchen floor for having abused her and her twin sister, Passion, since childhood. Now Letty is about to die in Angola, and everyone from a 20-year-old prostitute named Little Face Dautrieve to Belmont Pugh, the governor, is begging Robicheaux to get her off. To add to his incentive, two corrupt cops who figure in the case might also have killed his mother.</p>
        <p>Maybe I'm just getting used to this stuff, but the vicious physical punishment that Burke's characters inflict on one another isn't as wounding as the words they choose to express their bitter thoughts about their sorry lives. Although few characters in Burke's books can anticipate much of a life span, their language lives after them, and in this past-obsessed series they can always count on coming back as ghosts.</p>
        <p>''Florida's beauty creates the illusion of civilization,'' says Tim Dorsey, who strips away that illusion with a vengeance in HAMMERHEAD RANCH MOTEL (Morrow, $24), another raucous roadshow in the spirit of ''Florida Roadkill.'' With a wildfire raging across the Everglades and a killer hurricane gathering strength offshore, the stage is well and truly set for the cast of crazies who converge on a funky motel near Tampa Bay to pursue their various criminal trades.</p>
        <p>Harvey Fiddlebottom has installed a boiler-room operation in the boiler room. The Diaz Boys are running a smuggling ring from Room 10. There's a Balkan war criminal in Room 3, a mob boss in the witness protection program is hiding out in Room 5, and the arms dealers in Room 4 are being shelled by five Navy Seals who paddled ashore in a black raft. But the star boarder in this asylum is Serge A. Storms, a spree killer with the endearing trait of rattling off esoteric facts and folklore about Florida at the drop of a hat. Serge has killed (and stuffed) his quota of victims and is closing in on a stolen briefcase with $5 million when Hurricane Rolando-berto finally hits, bringing an end to this party but sparing a few survivors to continue the hilarious adventure another day.</p>
        <p>The ''odd couple'' is a staple of the classic whodunit (think Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, all those amateur detectives who confer with their cats), and Simon Brett gives it a sweet twist in THE BODY ON THE BEACH (Berkley Prime Crime, $21.95). The first entry in what promises to be a new series, this disarming cozy mystery introduces two mismatched sleuths who become friends and partners when they find themselves living side by side in Fethering, a seaside village (''not far from Tarring'') on the south coast of England.</p>
        <p>''Fethering is its own little world of double-glazed windows and double-glazed minds,'' but it suits Carole Seddon, a former civil servant with the Home Office whose anticipation of a quiet and sensible retirement is shattered when she goes walking on the beach and finds the body of a stranger. Even more disconcerting, the body disappears after she reports it to the police. Only her new neighbor, a blowsy bohemian who calls herself Jude, believes in Carole, and promptly persuades her to join forces in an undercover investigation -- starting with drinks at the town pub. Although Brett offers some acidic commentary on ''the suffocating aspirational gentility'' that is poisoning Fethering, he's more concerned here with getting a very nice friendship off the ground.</p>
        <p>There are things you really ought to know about Baron Alexander von Reisden -- disturbing things about this Austrian scientist's uncertain parentage and violent heritage -- before plunging into the dense narrative thickets of</p>
        <p>A CITIZEN OF THE COUNTRY (Ballantine, $24.95). Sarah Smith's dark and dreamy novel about fathers and sons and their family curses is unbearably coy in doling out background on its brooding hero; but Smith is such a seductive storyteller that it's worth stumbling through the foggy patches of the plot to reach Paris in 1911, where Reisden is currently director of a neurological health clinic.</p>
        <p>Jouvet Medical Analyses will lose a lucrative army contract unless Reisden agrees to spy on a friend, Count Andre de Montfort, whose family estate in Flanders holds an ancient military secret that could affect the outcome of a German invasion. But first he has to cure Andre, who runs a Grand Guignol theater company in which he plays Necrosar, ''King of Terrors,'' obsessively acting out macabre dramas about an accursed family whose members are forever murdering one another. Reisden gets his chance to accomplish both tasks when Andre invites him to the medieval castle and abbey of Montfort, where he is shooting a military film. (''The revolution, the Terror, witches, battles, guillotines. Oh G-d, it would be wonderful.'') But the venture is plagued by sinister deaths and disappearances, and rumor has it that someone in the company is practicing the evil arts.</p>
        <p>Once the story settles into Flanders, Smith has the perfect outlet for her romantic imagination. Taking inspiration from the chalky hills, the Roman history, the witchcraft legends and local landmarks that would soon be reduced to rubble in the war, she finds the ideal setting for resolving the sad, strange mysteries that have haunted Reisden since childhood.</p>
