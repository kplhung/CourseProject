        <p>Palm Springs is known for its population of dapper white-loafered, blue-haired snowbirds. Less known is that when they fly back north they molt, leaving behind bits of wardrobe and some very rich vintage shops. One, the Angel View Prestige Boutique at 454 North Indian Canyon, is stocked with Dior, Escada, Versace and, recently, a 40-pound Bob Mackie beaded gown. Charles Deichert, the general manager of the shop, which benefits the Angel View Crippled Children's Foundation, attributes his inventory to donors who don't want to be seen in the same dress more than a few times.</p>
        <p>On a recent visit it looked as if Krystle Carrington's wardrobe trailer had imploded; amid the other padded and peplumed 80's-wear were a black silk Oscar de la Renta cocktail dress with pouf sleeves and big purple polka dots ($20) and a Carol Horn jacket with faux baby seal padded shoulders ($75).</p>

        <p>The customers, often as vintage as the clothes, include Jane Wyman, Kaye Ballard and Barbara Sinatra. ''They all love this resale,'' Mr. Deichert said. ''They'll donate and then buy something else.'' But he added that not all the patrons are golden oldies: ''My staff says all kinds of L.A. rock groups come in to shop and everyone gets all atwitter, but I never know who they are.''</p>
