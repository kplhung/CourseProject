        <p>IT is not as if George W. Bush needed to convince Bobby Valentine that he could manage the country. Valentine is a registered Republican who last voted for the other ticket in 1972, for George McGovern.</p>
        <p>No, Valentine made it clear one day last week in his Shea Stadium office that he is a W. man, all the way to November, his 1992 dismissal as manager of the Texas Rangers notwithstanding.</p>
        <p>''We were third, two games behind Oakland, which wound up winning the division,'' Valentine said, his this-is-between-us smile tempting you to read between the lines. ''But there were all these higher expectations.''</p>
        <p>The Rangers were 45-41 at the time, it was only July, but Valentine was in his eighth year with a team that had never won its division. His retrospective, seen from the high ground of a better-paying job and another playoff race, is that ''they probably needed to make a change, a little acceleration, even if it didn't work.''</p>
        <p>At least Bush, who inherited Valentine when he became the Rangers' managing partner in 1989, didn't have some coach or functionary stick his head into Valentine's office and suggest he pack up, as another George with Republican Party ties has been known to do.</p>
        <p>''What I always thought was different than what I expected was that he worked within the structure,'' Valentine said of Bush. ''I figured he would be the one to say, 'O.K., we have a five-game losing streak, so we're going to wear a different color uniform today.' He didn't. That is, he recognized that there were part-owners, a team president, a general manager.''</p>
        <p>So Bush had Tom Grieve, the g.m. and Valentine's good friend, break the news, then summoned Valentine into his office, where the future governor said, ''If you have any complaints, I want to hear 'em.''</p>
        <p>''When someone gives you a closed-end statement, what are you going to say?'' Valentine said. ''I think what I did say was, 'I understand what you're doing, but I don't agree.' And after that, what I always appreciated was that we spent a lot more time talking about family, about more important things.''</p>
        <p>Valentine never did learn if his firing was a Grieve idea that Bush agreed with or a Bush idea that Grieve had no choice but to agree with. He settled on its being a ''collective decision,'' which made him more comfortable when the hotel room telephone rang in Pittsburgh in May at 7:30 a.m. and the candidate said, ''I've got a meeting this morning, but let's work out when I get back.''</p>
        <p>Bush, it turned out, was in town to make peace with John McCain after their bitter primary campaign. The governor and the manager hit the weights, just as they used to in the Rangers' clubhouse before the players would come in. They had lunch, Bush seemingly more interested in the Mets than in McCain.</p>
        <p>Oh, that was another thing that surprised Valentine about Bush. He was never a sports-talk-radio caller disguised as an owner, not the type to suggest they trade two utility infielders and his presidential father's autograph for Don Mattingly.</p>
        <p>''He actually immersed himself in the game, in the organization, from A ball on up,'' Valentine said. ''Sometimes it would be a little scary. He would ask if we could use some guy on another club's bench who really could have filled the need of a curveball-hitting pinch-hitter. I'd look at Grieve and say, 'Did you tell him that?'</p>
        <p>''What I really liked about him was that he didn't control conversations. He'd show off his intelligence most with his wit. He listened a lot but he had a wonderful presence. When he did say something, it was like E. F. Hutton, and he was usually outside the status quo. If I had a five-man rotation, he would say, 'Have you thought about going with a sixth starter in the hot weather?' There were times when we were losing, not drawing and some of the investors were worried about the return on their dollar. I just felt he always knew how to act, that he had good judgment. He knew the difference between right and wrong.''</p>
        <p>Before starting their current road swing through Arizona and Houston, Bush country, Valentine said he was eager to watch Bush's acceptance speech at the Republican convention in Philadelphia last Thursday night. People have been asking him all the time, he said, why they should vote for Bush, but he doesn't want to sound like some cable network partisan.</p>
        <p>''I know the man better than I know the candidate,'' Valentine said.</p>
        <p>George Bush, like Valentine, was an unconventional baseball man, and a political conservative who canned him with compassion.</p>
