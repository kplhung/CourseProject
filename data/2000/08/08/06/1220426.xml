        <p>FOR the first time, the median price for a single-family house in Westchester has exceeded $400,000, primarily because of a highly competitive market, multiple bids and a greater number of sales of high-priced properties.</p>
        <p>According to the report for the second quarter of 2000 from the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service, the median price of a single-family house was $412,000 -- $57,000, or 16 percent, higher than the same time last year. The report reflects sales that took place during April, May and June, traditionally the busiest selling season.</p>

        <p>FOR the first time, the median price for a single-family house in Westchester has exceeded $400,000, primarily because of a highly competitive market, multiple bids and a greater number of sales of high-priced properties.</p>
        <p>According to the report for the second quarter of 2000 from the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service, the median price of a single-family house was $412,000 -- $57,000, or 16 percent, higher than the same time last year. The report reflects sales that took place during April, May and June, traditionally the busiest selling season.</p>
        <p>''I wouldn't be surprised if it came down to under $400,000 again,'' said P. Gilbert Mercurio, the executive vice president of the Westchester County Board of Realtors. ''This number really reflects the peak of the spring selling season, when there tends to be more sales and more competition for houses.''</p>
        <p>Since then, brokers say, things have slowed down a bit, but houses are still selling quickly and often over the asking price. ''Now we're in the summer doldrums,'' said Merritt Mitchell, the president of Merritt Associates, which has offices in Larchmont, Scarsdale and Rye. ''Our inventory is being replenished, and a lot of buyers are out of town. Things are still moving, but the pace is not as frenetic as it was a few months ago.''</p>
        <p>Prices increased during the busy spring selling season because of two factors, Mr. Mercurio said: ''There was a highly competitive market with high demand, combined with low inventory. That accounted for price acceleration across the board.''</p>
        <p>The averages were also pushed up by a higher-than-usual number of sales of houses costing $500,000 and more, Mr. Mercurio added. That is reflected even more starkly in the average price for a single-family home, which reached $579,240, 24 percent higher than last year. ''The whole market pricing structure was pulled upward as a result,'' Mr. Mercurio said.</p>
        <p>Jane McAfee, a sales agent in the Bronxville office of Prudential Ragette who sells houses primarily in the Village of Bronxville and the Bronxville section of Yonkers, said that the most active part of her market was  homes priced from $300,000 to $340,000. ''It used to be $225,000 to $300,000,'' Ms. McAfee said. ''Now if someone calls me and asks to see something in the mid-$200,000's, I don't have anything to show them. I really feel sorry for buyers today. Westchester is really a tough place to find anything reasonable anymore.''</p>
        <p>There has also been a sharp increase in multiple bidding at all price levels, Mr. Mitchell said. ''I call it the passion of buyers,'' Mr. Mitchell said. ''They want the house and are willing to compete to get it. As a result, a lot of these houses are going for substantially over the asking prices.''</p>
        <p>In this atmosphere, Ms. McAfree said,  ''buyers have to really be ready to buy, or they lose out on houses.'' ''Being ready now means being preapproved for mortgages,'' she added. ''If a house is in good condition and is priced right, it can be sold over a weekend.''</p>
        <p>But some of those deals, particularly at the higher end, can fall apart because of  fluctuations in the stock market, said Anthony P. Cutugno, the director of Houlihan/ Lawrence's luxury properties division, in Bedford. ''After someone has successfully bid on a house, I've seen deals fall through,'' he said, ''because their stock wasn't worth as much later as it was when they were bidding.''</p>
        <p>Although the median and average prices have set records, the volume of sales slowed in the second quarter, compared with the last two years, when all previous sales records were broken. There were 2,342 closings in April, May and June, 6 percent fewer than the same period the last two years.</p>
        <p>''The drop in sales was due primarily to the lack of inventory,'' Mr. Mercurio said. ''That and higher interest rates knocked some people out of the market, particularly at the lower-priced end.''</p>
        <p>The inventory of all housing fell to 3,788 units in the second quarter, which was 24 percent below the level of the second quarter of 1999, and 43 percent below the 1998 level. The shortage was felt in all categories, including single-family homes, which experienced a 19 percent drop in supply to 2,351 units; condominiums, which dropped 40 percent to 280 units; and co-ops, which dropped 32 percent to 742 units.</p>
        <p>AS a result of the sharply lower supply, prices of condominiums and co-ops also rose. The median price for a condominium hit $180,000, a 12 percent increase in the last year, and the median price for a co-op was $70,500, an 8 percent increase.</p>
        <p>''There was great demand for the higher-priced co-ops,'' Mr. Mercurio said, ''which drove up the median. But at a median price of $70,500, co-ops are still the best bargain in Westchester. They're the most affordable option in the county and still a great way for someone to start out owning something in the county.''</p>
        <p>There are some signs that the dwindling inventory may be reversing itself. This year, inventory went from 3,288 units in the first quarter to 3,788 in the second, a 15 percent increase.</p>
        <p>''I think that the worst is over,'' Mr. Mercurio said. ''We're obviously going to be tracking it from quarter to quarter, and the  inventory has a long way to go to be at healthy levels for the market.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cutugno of Houlihan/Lawrence said that in the luxury properties division, inventory was the lowest it had been in 11 years. ''Inventory usually starts coming in after the Super Bowl in January,'' he said. ''But I've gotten more calls in May and June than for the first four months of the year.''</p>
        <p>Ms. McAfee of Prudential Ragette in Bronxville said that while she was starting to get more listings, too, ''I still can't take a buyer out to see 10 houses in their price range, because I don't have that many to show.''</p>
        <p>She added that she was looking forward to a less frenetic market and having more product to show.</p>
        <p>''This is not an ideal Realtors' market,'' she said. ''It's stressful having buyers making spilt-second decisions and being part of multiple-bidding situations. You have to deal with the buyers who lose out, too. I'd much prefer a calmer atmosphere, and still make money.''</p>
