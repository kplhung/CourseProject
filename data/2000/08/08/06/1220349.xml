        <p>ABOUT 150 students on the University of California campus in San Diego wear uniforms to class, have never taken the College Boards and can probably forget about spots on the school's basketball team.</p>
        <p>The sixth, seventh and eighth graders at the Preuss School, which opened last fall, are part of an unusual but growing arrangement between lower and higher education: a charter school. The school was the idea of a provost who, in the words of its director, Doris E. Alvarez, believed that ''the university should do more than talk about how kindergarten to 12th grade does not prepare you for college.''</p>
        <p>Such sentiments are driving universities to forge closer ties with charter schools -- public schools that operate under a state charter, independent of local bureaucracy. About 20 charter schools have recently opened on campuses in several states, including Arizona, Florida, Michigan and Massachusetts. The colleges are looking for an opportunity to influence education before students show up at their doors, especially in an era of rising standards in college and earlier. For the University of California, with affirmative action abolished in admissions decisions, it is also a way to lure minority students.</p>
        <p>The Preuss School is named for Peter Preuss, a software developer who donated $6 million for a building on campus. It accepts only poor youngsters, who attend for longer hours and more days than the norm and are tutored by university students and professors. Campus facilities are available to them, and when the school expands to higher grades, they will be able to take university classes.</p>
