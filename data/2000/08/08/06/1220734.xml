        <p>A bombing that wounded nine immigrants, six of them Jews, prompted Germany's foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, to suggest that a silent majority of Germans may be abetting such crimes by not speaking out against them.</p>
        <p>Immigrants, particularly in the formerly Communist east, find themselves repeated targets for neo-Nazi rightist groups, and Mr. Fischer was clearly taking aim at the apparent passivity of many Germans in the face of racist crimes that have become commonplace. It is time, he said, that the silent majority was ''roused.''</p>
