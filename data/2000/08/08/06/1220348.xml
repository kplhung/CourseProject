        <p>LABOR Day may seem a long four weeks away for most Americans, but for recent college graduates who took the summer off before beginning a lifetime of work, the holiday, also known as the day of reckoning, is approaching like a runaway train.</p>
        <p>Wistful hours of drifting in the pool like a youthful Dustin Hoffman have turned to hours of panic and free-floating dread: Will I get along with my new boss? Will I be able to express my opinions at work the way I did in school? Do I need to buy a suit?</p>
        <p>In the past, those questions were often answered by trial and error. Now the answers have been honed to a near science at Agnes Scott College in Decatur, Ga., a suburb of Atlanta, and provided to students there as part of a seminar series, called Senior Transitions, offered by the school's career-planning center just before seniors toss their tasseled caps.</p>
        <p>About 20 of the 200 students in a graduating class generally attend, said Gail L. Bell, acting director of career planning at Agnes Scott. The seminars are taught by employment specialists, local business leaders and the prior year's graduates, who provide anecdotes about mishaps and faux pas from their first year in the outside world.</p>
        <p>One aspect of life that troubles recent graduates is the difference between what is appropriate behavior in the classroom and what will fly in the office, Dr. Bell said. ''The boss may not be as enthusiastic about being challenged and questioned as your professor is,'' she said.</p>
        <p>In the office politics seminar, students are told that they should tend to overcommunicate with a boss at the beginning of a job, until they know how much information he or she wants and needs. Other pointers: Return calls promptly. Follow through on promises to the boss or co-workers. About buying that suit, there is no one answer, just some sage advice: observe the dress patterns at work, and follow them.</p>
