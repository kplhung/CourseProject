        <p>Despite all the high-minded claims about the Internet's potential for transforming business, education and much more in today's society, much of what is on the World Wide Web today still tends toward the prurient. Is there room in cyberspace for a discourse on ethics?</p>
        <p>All but four of the nation's 28 Jesuit colleges have decided there is. Last summer the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities began the Jesuit Distance Education Network, (www.ajcunet.edu/jnet/jnet.htm) to offer online classes, teaching ethical principles.

        <p>All but four of the nation's 28 Jesuit colleges have decided there is. Last summer the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities began the Jesuit Distance Education Network, (www.ajcunet.edu/jnet/jnet.htm) to offer online classes, teaching ethical principles. Each of the institutions involved donated $35,000 to get the network, known as JesuitNet, started.</p>
        <p>Richard P. Vigilante, the executive director of JesuitNet, said, ''What we're very consciously attempting to do now as we develop these courses is to embody the principles of Jesuit learning in the online offering: academic rigor, personalized instruction, faculty support, service learning and ethical concerns.'' He continued, ''So, we'll have smaller classes, and if you're studying biology, and if you're talking about genetics, the ethical implications of that will come up. That's what will set us apart.''</p>
        <p>So far, only 8 or 10 schools are offering classes online, many of them courses that were already being taught in traditional classrooms. About 2,500 students are enrolled in almost 200 virtual classes this summer, studying not only religion but also business education and nursing. Creighton University in Omaha offers two of its basic theology courses, ''Reading the Old Testament,'' and ''Catholicism; Creed and Question,'' online. And Regis University, in Denver, is offering a variety of business-related classes from its regular curriculum.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vigilante said he hoped to double the number of students by next summer, when the program is to be expanded to offer new courses and programs that could lead to graduate degrees. The network also hopes to develop new collaborative academic programs that are not available elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Fordham University, for example, is planning to help create a program called Catholic School Leadership with Boston College and the University of San Francisco in which students could earn master's degrees in school administration. And Fairfield University in Fairfield, Conn., and Georgetown University are jointly developing a graduate program in business ethics, which would lead to a master's degree in business administration.</p>
