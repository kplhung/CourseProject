        <p>FAR from the spotlight, the four will be living a dream at the United States Olympic swimming trials, which start a weeklong run in Indianapolis on Wednesday. For the two youngest, it is a chance to dip their toes into the waters of competition at the highest level. For the oldest, it is a last chance to realize an Olympic dream. For the fourth, it is a personal and medical triumph.</p>
        <p>Cristina Teuscher of New Rochelle and the Crestwood native Lea Loveless Maurer, gold medalists in the past, figure to produce the bulk of Westchester County's success at the Trials as well as medal hopes for the Games in Sydney in September.</p>
        <p>But 26-year-old Richelle Fox of Rye, who has taken a year out of her life for this, her third Olympic bid, has an outside chance to qualify. Andrew Chadeayne of Pleasantville has even less. And Kim Kelly of Mount  Vernon and Kathleen Morrissey of White Plains are two of the longest of long shots among the 1,400 hopefuls.</p>
        <p>''It's going to be a good experience for the next time around,'' Kathleen said.</p>
        <p>She has been 15 for all of 12 days as she heads into her sophomore year at the Ursuline School in New Rochelle. She stands 5 foot 3 and weighs 125 pounds. Her favorite activity, besides swimming, is ''hanging out with my friends.'' And she says she is as surprised as anyone else that she has a plane ticket to Indianapolis in her pocket.</p>
        <p>It is all because of one magical moment in a pool in Buffalo this spring.</p>
        <p>John Collins, coach of the Badger Swim Club in Larchmont, remembers that March day well. ''It was in the junior championships,'' he said. ''And Kathleen swam the race of her life. She was an upset winner at 1,000 yards and on the way got beneath the 800-meter qualifying time for the U.S. Trials.''</p>
        <p>It has not been smooth stroking since.</p>
        <p>''Realistically,'' Mr. Collins said, ''the U.S. will have Diana Munz and Brooke Bennett, the two fastest in the world at 800 meters. Kathleen would have to improve on her surprise best by 40 seconds to be in contention.</p>
        <p>''But she has promise, and it is a great opportunity to be there and a good learning experience. She has, however, tailed off a bit this summer.''</p>
        <p>Mary Beth Morrissey, Kathleen's mother, agreed.</p>
        <p>''She's had a really hard time, mentally, struggling with the whole idea of it,'' Mrs. Morrissey said of the upcoming Trials. ''But the last two weeks, Kathleen has started to feel more comfortable with it. She's gotten enormous support from her Badger teammates.''</p>
        <p>Kathleen said, ''Yes, I'll be nervous -- but now I think it will be a good nervous. It will help me.'' Kim Kelly, a classmate of Kathleen's at Ursuline, has had little time to worry about her long-shot status, having  qualified only eight days ago, on her 14th birthday. Her mother, Dorothea, who will be going to Indianapolis, too, described her daughter as ecstatic. Mr. Collins describes the 90-pound Kim as ''a little dynamo with a big opportunity.''</p>
        <p>Kim herself says she is ''very excited.''</p>
        <p>''Since I was about 8,'' she said, ''going to the Olympics has been a high dream of mine. This is just for the experience but, hopefully, the next time . . . I just love to swim.''</p>
        <p>So does Chadeayne (pronounced SHHA-dane) -- so much so that he stayed in the water after doctors told him not to.</p>
        <p>About to enter his senior season at Princeton, the backstroker was enjoying a standout junior year -- until February.</p>
        <p>''I was swimming better than I ever had,'' he said by phone from DeNunzio Pool at Princeton, where he practices every day, ''and I got mono right smack dab in the middle of the season.''</p>
        <p>Mononucleosis is an infectious blood disease that leaves its host weak. Hard physical activity, like competitive swimming, is definitely not recommended.</p>
        <p>Chadeayne swam anyway, finishing Princeton's dual meet and Ivy League championship schedule.</p>
        <p>Rob Orr, the veteran Princeton swimming coach, said: ''He went downhill a bit, but he was still our best backstroker, the one we put in our medley relays.''</p>
        <p>Chadeayne said: ''I made a decision. I could either swim with mono and feel bad or not swim and maybe get better faster.''</p>
        <p>He swam.</p>
        <p>''They told me that I needed two months off. My own doctor advised me against swimming. I had to sign a bunch of waivers, and we had doctors down at the pool. It was kind of a hassle.''</p>
        <p>It was before the mono that he qualified for the trials in the 200-meter backstroke. How fast can he go at Indianapolis? ''The way I've been training,'' he said, ''I could do a 2:06, or a 2:12.'' And what would he need to make the team? He laughed. ''Oh, about a 1:58. But I'll enjoy just seeing and being with the best of the best.''</p>
        <p>Richelle Fox's goals are different. She is living a long-distance marriage in a bid for a long-shot Olympic berth. After seven years on the national team as a leading butterfly and freestyle swimmer, she is still waiting for an Olympic spot.</p>
        <p>''This is the last time around,'' she said from her Rye apartment, her base when not swimming or lifting weights. ''I think I'm best in the 100 fly -- there's Jenny Thompson and then a lot of us who could finish second, including me. But only two make it, and in the 100 freestyle they take six, to have people for the relay.''</p>
        <p>She estimates that in the butterfly, it will take a 58.5-second effort to make the team, a second under her personal best. Mr. Collins, however, said: ''She's trained like a dog. She'll be in the mix.''</p>
        <p>And then, after Sydney or after not making the team, she will move to Philadelphia. She will again be with her husband, the 1996 sprint relay gold medalist David Fox, a financial executive.</p>
        <p>The two prime medal hopes, Teuscher, an individual medley and freestyle specialist, and Maurer, a backstroker, also come up to the trials in excellent shape. ''They've trained well, and they're focused,'' Mr. Collins said. ''Their chances? Well, I wouldn't trade places with any other coaches.''</p>
