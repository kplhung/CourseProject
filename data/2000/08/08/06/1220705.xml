        <p>IT'S funny how most women in movies of the 60's look slightly preposterous in the bouffant flips and false eyelashes of the day - except Catherine Deneuve, who looks spectacular in Luis Bunuel's BELLE DE JOUR (1967). Ms. Deneuve plays Severine Serizy, a bored french newlywed who takes an afternoon job at a tasteful little brothel and learns a lot about herself. Or does she? What's real and what's fantasy in this film isn't always clear (although I'm pretty sure the duel, muck-throwing and horsewhipping scenes exist only in Severine's mind). N'importe pas. It's just Bunuel's way of having fun with us, brilliantly - Tuesday at 10:30 p.m. and Tuesday/Early Wednesday at 4 a.m. on Bravo.</p>

        <p>Were it not for ''West Side Story,'' Stanley Kramer's JUDGMENT AT NUREMBERG (1961) might have swept the Oscars in its year. Only Maximilian Schell, who was named best actor for his role as the Germans' defense lawyer, and Abby Mann, who won for his screenplay, beat out the New York street-gang musical for their awards. The cast also includes Burt Lancaster, Judy Garland and a very young William Shatner. Montgomery Clift is brilliant as a mentally unbalanced witness who was forcibly sterilized by the Nazis. Marlene Dietrich seems slightly ill at ease asa German general's widow. Spencer Tracy plays the American judge come to lead the tribunal a little smugly. But that doesn't detract from the film's strength as a potent, thoughtful drama about guilt, following orders and degrees of goodness among the ''good Germans'' - Saturday at 10:30 p.m. on TCM.</p>
        <p>Tita is the youngest of three daughters, and her mother decides that she won't be allowed to marry. Pedro, the man she loves, must marry one of the older sisters, while Tita stays home and devotes her life to serving her mother. Overcoming the prospects of a future like that will be tough, but Alfonso Arau's sublimely sensual LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE (1992) shows the way, with a lot of great food, a little magical realism and time. Lumi Cavazos, Marco Leonardi ad Regina Torne are the stars - Monday at 8 and 11 p.m. and Tuesday at 5 p.m. on Bravo.</p>
        <p>Don't let David Mamet fool you. Writing profane staccato late-20th-century American dialogue is not his only talent. He does beautifully with Edwardian Londoners' speech as writer and director of THE WINSLOW BOY (1999), based on Terence Rattigan's 1946 play. The story - about a boy (Guy Edwards) accused a stealing a five-shilling postal order and his father's determination to clear his son's name, even if he destroys himself and his family in the process - stays true to its period while pointing out all sorts of contemporary parallels. Nigel Hawthorne is outstanding as the father, Jeremy Northam is powerful (and devastatingly handsome) as the celebrity lawyer he hires, and Rebecca Pidgeon is striking as the Winslows' self-possed suffragist daughter - Thursday at 8:15 p.m. on Cinemax.</p>
        <p>Herbert Ross could have gone so wrong with BOYS ON THE SIDE (1995). But this three-woman road movie about a black lesbian singer, a battered blond mother-to-be and a white real estate agent with AIDS driving cross-country to start new lives turns out to be gutsy, wistful and nicely sardonic. The cast helps: Whoopi Goldberg, Drew Barrymore and Mary-Louis Parker (the standout here) - Thursday at 8 p.m. on Channel 5.</p>
