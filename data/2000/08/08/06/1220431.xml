        <p>YOU can call him Paul Fischer. Or you can call him Paul. Or you can  call him Mr. Fischer. But if you really want to get to heart of the matter, call him Mister Mustard. Really. He doesn't mind. Everybody calls him that.</p>
        <p>For 28 years the Mr. Fischer, a 69-year-old Franklin Lakes resident, has owned and operated House of Herbs Inc., a Passaic company that puts out jars of a spicy condiment called Mister Mustard. It's a quirky brand that sports a retro image of a chef with a luxuriant mustachio and a dreamy look in his eyes.</p>
        <p>''How shall I describe it?'' said Mr. Fischer. ''We make a mustard that's better in quality than the run-of-the-mill, but we're not a Grey Poupon.''</p>
        <p>Ah, but it's a Jersey mustard, and that's got to count for something.</p>
        <p>More sophisticated than ketchup, more daring than mayo, mustard is the king of condiments, and the condiment of kings. King Louis XI of France traveled everywhere with his mustard pot. He would always have a supply on hand -- and he neatly sidestepped nasty poisoning plots. During the 14th century Avignon Papacy, Pope John XXII named his nephew Chief Mustardeer to the Pope. And Thomas Jefferson, who was consumed as much with perfecting the gardens surrounding Monticello as he was with nailing down inalienable rights, planted mustard seeds after sampling a good Dijon during his French ambassadorship.</p>
        <p>Travel the nation in this season of beaches, ball games and cookouts, and you'll find millions slathering yellow or brown paste on their dogs and sausages, their pretzels, knishes and bratwursts.but historically, Americans have preferred not to mess with eye-watering, nose-running mixtures consumed with such, well, relish in the rest of the world. When the upstate New Yorkers George and Francis French introduced their classic yellow mustard in 1904, they softened the mustard seed's kick and added turmeric for coloring. The result was a mild (some would say bland) yellow mustard that has become the No. 1 mustard in North America, forever duking it out with the slightly spicier (though not by much) brown mustard first concocted by Charles Gulden on Elizabeth Street in Manhattan in 1862.</p>
        <p>Mustard sales hit $300 million last year, a 10 percent rise over the last five years, and New Jersey tosses its fair share into that fray. Numerous food companies call the Garden State their home. There is French's (with headquarters in Wayne), Gulden's (Parsippany), Hellman's (Englewood Cliffs), and A&amp;P (Montvale). Even Grey Poupon is distributed by Nabisco in East Hanover. This doesn't mean the mustards are made here. French's, for example, produces its condiment in Springfield, Mo. But scan the label on these products and you come up Jersey.</p>
        <p>So in that sense, New Jersey brings mustard to the masses.</p>
        <p>But faceless national brands don't exactly inspire local loyalty. Heck, in Cleveland, baseball fans alone are torn between two hometown brands -- Bertman's Ballpark and Stadium Mustard -- which have slugged it out for years. Things don't get that heated in Jersey. But if there is passion to be found, it could lie with the state's few small mustards.</p>
        <p>One of the oldest is Pulaski Stone Ground, produced by family-owned Pulaski Products in Carlstadt. It is a strong, yellow-brown mustard that has graced shelves in Polish-American homes since 1934. According to Stanley Mazepa, who bought the company in 1977 from its founder, John Warren, the mustard is still popular in towns with a large Polish community: Garfield, Clifton, Linden, and Wallington.</p>
        <p>As a youngster, Mr. Mazepa recalls slathering his grandmother's own homemade Old World mustard. ''I wished I'd gotten that recipe,'' he said wistfully. ''It had a kick.''</p>
        <p>When he wasn't eating that, his family enjoyed one of two types of Polish mustard: Pulaski or its rival, Chicago-based Kosciusko. Both came packed in a glass mug. The Pulaski label bore the image of Gen. Casimir Pulaski, the Polish-born hero of the American Revolutionary War.</p>
        <p>Today, the glass mug is gone, but the general lives on, with his own delicate mustachio and presiding over a condiment that, thanks to a touch of horseradish, takes no prisoners.</p>
        <p>''A few years ago we did kick it up a few notches,'' said Mr. Mazepa, 54. ''We made it a little stronger, and people called saying they liked it. It's not bland. You could have it on a kielbasa and it stands out.''</p>
        <p>Another standout -- and maybe even hotter -- is the Original Hot Mister Mustard. According to Mr. Fischer, the pungent recipe was first conceived as a specialty mustard by the brand's originator, a man he knows only as Mr. Frank, of the Frank Tea and Spice Company of Cincinnati. ''He liked mustard but he could never find one that he liked when he went out to dinner,'' said Mr. Fischer. So, like King Louis XI, Mr. Frank packed his own. ''He'd walk into restaurants with this mustard pot and people would say, 'Here comes Mister Mustard.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fisher bought the Mister Mustard brand, recipe and customer list from the Durkee company 20 years ago. Using the original recipe and label, he began grinding mustard seed with a stone mill at his Ann Street operation in Passaic, and introduced two more varieties: Sweet Hot Mister Mustard and a Mister Mustard with Honey.</p>
        <p>Predictably, he could not escape picking up the monicker, too. ''I started walking into my country club and people call me Mister Mustard,'' said Mr. Fischer. ''I have a house down in Florida, and when I go down there, the same thing happens.''</p>
        <p>He has accepted the mustard mantle with pride. When in Florida, Mr. Fischer tools around Boca Raton in a sports Mercedes with an unofficial license plate that reads -- what else? -- MR. MUSTARD.</p>
        <p>In the teeming world of condiments, Pulaski and Mister Mustard are scrappy supermarket sellers that consistently earn the love of their fans. They stand outside the realm of flashier brands competing in the same market. The Silver Palate, a specialty foods company in Cresskill associated with the ''The Silver Palate Cookbook,'' produces five mustards and two mustard sauces. Jars are topped with a dainty red-and-white cloth tied with a bit of string. A 7.5 ounce jar of Mister Mustard retails for $1.39, tops; a 7-ounce jar of Silver Palate green peppercorn garlic mustard runs $3 to $4.</p>
        <p>Customers pay for the product, and they also pay for the cachet.</p>
        <p>Or the story. Like the one about Ed and Doris Simpson, high school sweethearts who grew up in Irvington before World War II. He was a mechanical engineer, she was a home economist with an interest in colonial recipes. In 1974, they opened Muirhead, a restaurant in their historic 14-room colonial home in Ringoes. They kept an herb garden and mixed their own dressings and condiments. Patrons often left asking for a bottle of the vinaigrette. In time, said Mr. Simpson, now 73, the couple decided to shift gears. In 1994, they closed the restaurant and devoted themselves to managing their growing food line, Muirhead of Ringoes. Their signature product, pecan pumpkin butter, is now sold through Williams-Sonoma.</p>
        <p>Muirhead makes three mustards; the two best are the honey mustard and horseradish (the other is a Dijon). The operation is decidedly small: family members and employees still gather in the kitchen to mix small batches. A national company acts as distributor, and Mr. Simpson himself delivers jars to stores like Delicious Orchards in Colts Neck. He also fills orders placed through muirheadfoods.com.</p>
        <p>A member of the World Mustard Association, Mr. Simpson can attest to the expanding challenges and headaches of the market. With so many mustards out there, how can customers find yours? And for all the market growth, not everyone is a mustard nut. A jar can last six months in most refrigerators. He chuckled when a wiseacre recently suggested that he approach the Meadowlands.</p>
        <p>''Ballparks and stadiums in this country use about 15 million pounds of mustard a year,'' said Mr. Simpson. ''Would one be able to corral that market, you'd be talking thousands of pounds. To them it becomes a price picture. If they can buy it for a penny cheaper, they will.''</p>
        <p>But the thought lingered in his head.</p>
        <p>''Volume would enable me to lower the price,'' he said. ''Let's just say it's available.''</p>
