        <p>BIAYS-Virginia Langshaw, age 86, of Delray Beach, Florida, died at her Abbey Delray South residence on July 31, 2000. Before moving to Delray Beach in 1988, Virginia and her family lived in Manhasset (Long Island), New York City, and Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. Known to friends and family as ''Ginny,'' she was a loving and devoted wife for fifty-two years to John Sheridan Biays (Lt. Col. USAR-Ret.) who passed away in 1994. While raising her family, she became an active volunteer for several organizations, including Christ Church Episcopal and Beaches Hospital. She is survived by her daughter, Carol Biays Cushmore of Edina, MN; her son, John S. Biays, Jr. of Boca Raton FL; her grandson, Christopher Biays Cushmore; her niece, Deborah Langshaw Simon of Kennebunkport, ME; and her nephew, Michael Wood of Kansas City, MO. A graveside service will be held at Arlington National Cemetery on August 15 at 11AM. In lieu of flowers, her family suggests memorial contributions be made to one's favorite charity. Lorne &amp; Sons Funeral Home, Delray Beach, FL.</p>
