        <p>Public Advocate Mark Green, calling state rules that require pharmacies to post their drug prices outdated and virtually useless, said yesterday that a survey by his staff had found the posted prices wrong at virtually every one of the 65 drugstores they visited.</p>
        <p>Mr. Green was joined at a news conference by Richard N. Gottfried, a Manhattan Democrat and chairman of the Assembly Health Committee, who said he would introduce a bill requiring more accurate consumer notification through frequently updated computer printouts.</p>

        <p>Public Advocate Mark Green, calling state rules that require pharmacies to post their drug prices outdated and virtually useless, said yesterday that a survey by his staff had found the posted prices wrong at virtually every one of the 65 drugstores they visited.</p>
        <p>Mr. Green was joined at a news conference by Richard N. Gottfried, a Manhattan Democrat and chairman of the Assembly Health Committee, who said he would introduce a bill requiring more accurate consumer notification through frequently updated computer printouts.</p>
        <p>The two officials, speaking to reporters in front of a pharmacy near Union Square Park in Manhattan, directed their criticism at a 27-year-old state law that requires pharmacies to display large cardboard posters listing the store's prices for 154 commonly used prescription drugs.</p>
        <p>Pharmacists are required to update the prices, but Mr. Green said that most either ignored the rule or found it too cumbersome to follow. He called the system ''a cardboard cutout of bureaucracy at its worst.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gottfried said the proposed law would require that computer printouts be posted in stores and made available for shoppers to take home.</p>
        <p>A report by Mr. Green's staff said its survey of 65 pharmacies last month found the current system to be fraught with inaccuracies. Where prices were posted at all, it said, they were often lower than what customers where actually charged.</p>
        <p>In two extreme examples, it said, one store posted its price for Pravachol, a cholesterol-reducing drug, at $7.29 when the price was actually $248.75, and another posted Lipitor, another cholesterol drug, at $69.50, when the price was $180.</p>
        <p>Even where the posted prices were accurate or closer to reality, Mr. Green said, many of the posters were illegible because of repeated erasures, or were obstructed by store displays or hung too far behind drugstore counters to be read easily. Mr. Green's inspectors said only two of the stores they inspected complied fully with the law.</p>
