        <p>IN a business culture that has long fixated ambivalently on the image of computer wizards brewing technological revolution in their garage, the back-story to the pair of digital copyright battles being waged in federal courts on either coast has a familiar ring.</p>
        <p>The Napster case in San Francisco involves a 19-year-old college student who created a program allowing him to swap music files with his friends. The program became so popular so fast that the major record labels claim it has led to widespread music piracy, threatening their ability to turn a profit and the incentive of artists to create music.</p>
        <p>The DVD trial in New York began with a Norwegian high school student who cracked the encryption program protecting Hollywood's digitized movies from unauthorized copying. Leading movie studios argue that unless a judge stops a Web site publisher from distributing the 16-year-old's decryption code, they will soon suffer the same fate as the record industry.</p>
        <p>Depending on who you believe, these are either tales of David vs. Goliath or of irresponsible hackers taking aim at the establishment. But no matter which side you're on, both cases have underscored the unprecedented ability of individuals armed with digital technology to upset the status quo.</p>
        <p>''We're very much looking at a biological model of an epidemic,'' said Esther Dyson, publisher of the technology newsletter Release 1.0. ''On the Internet, a product doesn't require a central host and it doesn't require central distribution, it just spreads. It's new in business. It's been going on a long time in viruses.''</p>
        <p>As more people connect to the Internet, with faster connections, the information released on it takes on ever-greater momentum and scale. Services like Napster are seen as only the beginning of a technological siege for industries founded on traditional notions of intellectual property.</p>
        <p>In fact, many Internet watchers, Ms. Dyson among them, believe that companies that put information online, from music to books to software, may have to resign themselves to relinquishing control over that material. The fact that you copyrighted something simply may no longer entitle you to control it or get paid for it.</p>
        <p>''This is an idea whose time has come,'' said John Perry Barlow, the vice chairman of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and author of an essay ''The Economy of Ideas,'' which in 1994 predicted a fundamental shift in the way intellectual property is valued. ''We're dealing with a profound historical shift in the economy that has been enabled by technology.''</p>
        <p>This is essentially what happened in the Napster and DVD cases, and though federal judges saw fit to issue injunctions in each case, that may be irrelevant in the world of electronic commerce.</p>
        <p>PERHAPS the most telling moments in the Napster saga came between the time Judge Marilyn Patel issued a temporary injunction effectively shutting down the service and the stay that was granted not quite 48 hours later by a higher court. Despite a clear statement by Judge Patel that Napster was likely to be found guilty of contributing to copyright infringement, millions of individuals swarmed to download music from the service, or learn about alternative services that provide the means to swap music files.</p>
        <p>Similarly, the DVD decryption code patched together by Jon Johansen in Norway has been posted on hundreds of Web sites besides the one that Hollywood has taken to court, many of which say they are simply upholding their right to share technology information.</p>
        <p>In both cases, technology and its users are undermining traditional institutions, while asserting a populist sense of what is ethical that may well clash with what is legal. That has raised questions that go well beyond the outcome of the court battles.</p>
        <p>What happens, for instance, if Judge Patel in San Francisco and Judge Lewis A. Kaplan in New York come down on the side of the entertainment industry, but the distribution of both copyrighted music and a computer code that cracks legally protected encryption continues undeterred?</p>
        <p>''Law is very vulnerable when it makes orders that don't get enforced,'' said Charles Nesson, director of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University. ''Law consists of two things, the coercive power to impose a sanction on someone who violates it and the willingness of people to obey the law without actually putting it to the test. The more you undermine the credibility of law with the people who are governed by it, the more you need sanctions to keep order.''</p>
        <p>But can any court arrest 20 million Napster users around the world? Intellectual property has always depended on both legal and physical barriers to copying, Mr. Nesson noted. With the physical barriers all but removed, the reliance of copyright holders on the law may be straining it beyond its capacity to be effective.</p>
        <p>These information-sharing technologies are still in their infancy. Napster's file-swapping progeny, like Freenet and Gnutella, dispense with any vestiges of central information altogether. Everything from video games to Scientology texts are being traded over such networks, which hit the Internet just a few months ago. And the inventors of even newer ones with names like MojoNation and COLAVision were demonstrating their wares last week at a hacker convention in Las Vegas.</p>
        <p>BASED on what has become known as ''peer-to-peer'' technology, such services have vastly simplified the ability of individuals to trade files of any sort among themselves, and to decide for themselves whether or not to obey copyright law. Most seem to be choosing the latter.</p>
        <p>''I use Napster, I'd be crazy if I wouldn't,'' wrote one 14-year-old in an e-mail message after Judge Patel issued her preliminary injunction last month. ''It lets me sample the songs from a CD and I get to see if I want to buy the CD or not. I don't find it to be any damaging to any musicians. I actually think it is helping them.''</p>
        <p>In part because that attitude may herald a shift in the law and in part because the music industry will face other, less centralized networks using similar technology, many legal experts and economists believe that the record labels would be better off adapting their business models than suing Napster for copyright infringement.</p>
        <p>''We are still very much a common-law culture,'' said Lawrence Lessig, a law professor at Stanford University who has submitted a brief urging that Napster not be shut down. ''If the law does not accord with the view of the common kid, then the law will change.''</p>
        <p>Few of the Napster refugees flooding the Gnutella mailing list with set-up questions last week seemed terribly concerned about the outcome of the San Francisco case.</p>
        <p>''Can someone please inform me on how to start everything up,'' read one typical post by a new user, ''I wanna get to mp3's.''</p>
