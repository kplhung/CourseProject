        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As the editor of Douglas Brinkley's ''Rosa Parks'' in the Lipper/Viking Penguin Lives series, I was troubled by Michael Anderson's assertion (July 16) that Brinkley was guilty of ''sloppy sentence structure'' in a passage that ''has Bayard Rustin rather than A. Philip Randolph threatening a march on Washington in 1941.'' I can understand how Anderson might have misread the sentence. Not many historians know that Rustin, later one of the key figures of the civil rights movement, was linked to the proposed march as the leader of its ''youth wing.'' Brinkley wasn't ''careless,'' as Anderson supposes: the sentence linking both Randolph and Rustin to this march (which never actually took place) is factually and grammatically accurate.</p>
