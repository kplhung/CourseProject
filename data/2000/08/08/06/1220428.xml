        <p>DANIEL J. MOONEY of Bridgeport, a World War II veteran, and two of his grandsons shared a common distinction this June. They all received their diplomas, but while his grandsons were young men graduating from high school and college, Mr. Mooney, at 76, was getting his diploma from Central High School, following a hiatus of 57 years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mooney received his long-delayed diploma because of state legislation that went into effect on Memorial Day, authorizing school districts to award diplomas to all honorably discharged World War II veterans who would have graduated had they not been called to serve in the armed forces and did not receive a diploma as a consequence of their service.</p>
        <p>Since the bill passed, veterans across Connecticut have received diplomas at high school graduation exercises and private ceremonies. Milford, Bridgeport, Danbury, Bristol, Cheshire, Stratford, New Britain, New Haven and Windsor are among the cities and towns that have awarded diplomas since the law went into effect. Others are expected to follow suit.</p>
        <p>Referring to his youngest grandson, Bryon Karagas, 18, who graduated from Fairfield Preparatory School, Mr. Mooney said: ''He got his high school diploma the easy way, playing football. I had to go under fire to get mine.'' He said he felt it was ''a great honor'' for his grandsons to graduate at the same time he did.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mooney was a high school senior when he joined the Army on Feb. 5, 1943. His father was against it, he said, because his father and one of his brothers had been wounded in World War I. A second brother was killed in action, Mr. Mooney said.</p>
        <p>''But I wanted to go,'' he added. ''I was deployed to Italy and quickly committed to combat. When we were just south of Bologna, Italy, I was on the receiving end of a German grenade. I was hit in the leg and was 80 percent disabled.'' As a result of being wounded in action, he received a Silver Star, a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart. His injury led to multiple surgeries and an honorable discharge. He returned home, recovered from his injuries, got a job, married and started a family. With all these things going on in his life, he never got around to returning to school, he said.</p>
        <p>Like many young soldiers of his generation, Hudson Pelton Jr., 75, of Old Saybrook, willingly left Windsor High School at the age of 17 to join the Navy in 1942. He considers himself fortunate that he returned from the war unharmed, and soon afterward married and had two daughters. But he said it was always ''rather embarrassing'' when people would talk about their high school reunions because he had never graduated and could not join in the conversation. On July 18, he received his diploma during a private ceremony at Windsor High School.</p>
        <p>Grandfathers typically feel pride in the accomplishments of their grandchildren, but Mr. Pelton has extra reason to extol the accomplishments of his granddaughter, Colleen Fenn, 13, of Ledyard, because she was instrumental in getting the diploma legislation passed. Colleen approached Representative Ruth Fahrbach, a Windsor Republican, about her grandfather's sadness over never having received his high school diploma.</p>
        <p>''I knew my grandfather didn't get his diploma because of the war, and I knew it meant a lot to him,'' Colleen said. ''We called a few people who told us who we should talk with at the State Capitol. It was definitely a very special thing to do and brought me and my grandfather a lot closer.''</p>
        <p>With the assistance of Ms. Fahrbach, Colleen presented her case to Lt. Gov. M. Jodi Rell, who backed the initiative and helped them bring it to fruition through a series of conferences and the acquisition of more high-powered allies: Gov. John G. Rowland, Department of Veterans Affairs Commissioner Eugene Migliaro and State Board of Education Commissioner Theodore Sergei.</p>
        <p>''Many of the soldiers who fought in World War II put their country before themselves by going to battle before finishing their high school education,'' Mr. Rowland said. ''But now, with many of them in their 70's and 80's, we have a chance to do the right thing, recognize them for their accomplishments and acknowledge that except for their own selflessness, they would have earned a high school diploma long ago.''</p>
        <p>The commissioner's office had received a similar request from the New Hampshire wife of a veteran who left high school in Connecticut to join the service and always felt bad about not having his diploma, said Bob Norman, a spokesman for the State Veterans Administration. The veteran was in a Connecticut nursing home with a terminal disease. Although New Hampshire had enacted Operation Recognize for this purpose, Mr. Norman discovered that he could not obtain a diploma for the veteran under existing Connecticut statutes, although he managed to obtain an honorary diploma before the man died.</p>
        <p>''From there we said, 'Let's do it right to enable all of the state's World War II veterans to graduate and get their diplomas,' '' Mr. Norman said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Migliaro, 74, is himself a World War II veteran who joined the Marines at the age of 17. He was adamant about making sure full-fledged diplomas would be awarded in the future, not honorary ones.</p>
        <p>''When our soldiers were shot and dying, they weren't hit by honorary bullets,'' he said. ''No one has tried to award an honorary diploma, but the minute anyone does, I'll be back at the Capitol. Our veterans deserve the real thing, not an honorary degree.''</p>
        <p>Like many veterans, Mr. Migliaro said he did not have time to return to high school once the war was over. He took a test and obtained his high school equivalency certificate, but said he knew countless veterans who did not have this opportunity. Mr. Migliaro, a former State Representative who served in the General Assembly for 12 years, said he knew how embarrassing it was not to have a diploma or degree when it seemed everyone else did. He earned his bachelor's degree in 1993 from Charter Oak University at the age of 67.</p>
        <p>The General Assembly held public hearings and enacted the legislation. In addition to New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Florida have legislation to award high school diplomas to World War II veterans, and Mr. Migliaro would like to see the initiative enacted nationwide.</p>
        <p>Out of 16.5 million World War II veterans, only five million are still alive, and 400,000 are dying each year, Mr. Migliaro said. Connecticut originally had 238,000 World War II veterans, but only 140,000 are still alive, and they are dying at a rate of 2,500 a year. Mr. Migliaro estimates 2,000 to 5,000 Connecticut veterans will request diplomas.</p>
        <p>''What's interesting about this initiative is it serves two purposes,'' said Tom Murphy, spokesman for the State Department of Education. ''It recognizes the veterans who sacrificed a great deal, and it provides a very powerful image to high school seniors whose futures are as bright as can be about how their counterparts were swept into world conflict. The world at peace they are living in was brought to them by the sacrifices of their grandfathers.''</p>
        <p>The statute leaves school boards wide latitude concerning who should be awarded the diplomas, Mr. Murphy said. ''It doesn't even say the veteran has to be alive,'' he said. ''If a family member knows it was something the veteran always wanted, it can be awarded posthumously.''</p>
        <p>Qualifying dates of active service to receive a high school diploma are Dec. 7, 1941, to Dec. 31, 1946. Veterans must submit a copy of their honorable military discharge and evidence of high school attendance.</p>
        <p>''I always felt like a dummy in the legislature and was proud as a peacock in my cap and gown,'' Mr. Migliaro said. ''It's important right now to take care of a dying breed. It's a heart-touching award and a tribute to veterans to get their diploma out of respect. They earned it the hard way.''</p>
        <p>World War II veterans who would like to receive their diplomas should contact the Board of Education for the school district where their high school is situated.</p>
