        <p>''I'm Raven, I'm a Satanist and I'll be doing your makeup.'' It is a line no actress wants to hear when facing the mirror. But in ''Cecil B. DeMented,'' the latest John Waters comedy, Honey Whitlock, a kidnapped Hollywood starlet, will never be ready for her close-up as long as she looks like Melanie Griffith. No surprise, then, that Ms. Griffith, right, doesn't look like herself for very long in the film, which opens Friday. With her hair bleached beyond blond (''You're going off the deep end of the Clairol color chart,'' her hairstylist says) and her eyelids painted kohl black, Honey goes from Left Coast banal to the height of terrorist chic. Van Smith, the costume designer, said the film marks a return to the radical makeup he provided for the earlier Waters films ''Pink Flamingos'' and ''Female Trouble.''</p>

        <p>''I'm Raven, I'm a Satanist and I'll be doing your makeup.'' It is a line no actress wants to hear when facing the mirror. But in ''Cecil B. DeMented,'' the latest John Waters comedy, Honey Whitlock, a kidnapped Hollywood starlet, will never be ready for her close-up as long as she looks like Melanie Griffith. No surprise, then, that Ms. Griffith, right, doesn't look like herself for very long in the film, which opens Friday. With her hair bleached beyond blond (''You're going off the deep end of the Clairol color chart,'' her hairstylist says) and her eyelids painted kohl black, Honey goes from Left Coast banal to the height of terrorist chic. Van Smith, the costume designer, said the film marks a return to the radical makeup he provided for the earlier Waters films ''Pink Flamingos'' and ''Female Trouble.''</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Smith's extreme makeup has competition. In ''X-Men,'' for instance, blue body paint and reptilian prosthetics give Rebecca Romijn-Stamos her Mystique, while in ''The Eyes of Tammy Faye,'' false eyelashes and gallons of mascara do the same for the fallen religious broadcaster Tammy Faye Bakker Messner, right. And in her latest video, Christina Aguilera wears a surplus of shimmering blue shadow that would have done Divine proud.</p>
        <p>While makeup artists may be influenced by these films, most women won't be swayed. That disappoints Mr. Smith. ''People say you're hiding behind makeup; I don't agree with that,'' he said, invoking the name of a known kohl abuser: ''Look at Louise Nevelson. Was she hiding?  No. It was 'Look at me and look what I created.' '' Cecil B. DeMented's sentiments exactly.</p>
