        <p>SIX FLAGS amusement parks are best known for their scary roller coasters that turn riders upside-down, and this summer investors may well feel that they have been along for the ride. The stock has had a negative total return of 43.29 percent so far this year, and its price has fallen to $16.375 from its 52-week high of $39.1875, set last August.</p>
        <p>Even more frightening, much of that slump has happened since the start of July -- at the height of the parks' season -- and two leading Wall Street analysts say the cool, rainy summer weather in the Northeast and Midwest has further dampened the company's prospects.</p>
        <p>The company's results for the second quarter are to be released this week. But investors are much more on edge about the outlook for the remainder of the summer, particularly after word on July 21 from Six Flags' smaller rival, Cedar Fair L.P., that attendance at its five parks has been below expectations.</p>
        <p>The two companies are the only publicly traded regional amusement park operators; they have several parks in the same geographic regions. Six Flags Inc., which changed its name last month from Premier Parks, operates 27 amusement and water parks in the United States, 7 in Europe and 1 in Mexico. Cedar Fair has four water parks in addition to its five amusement parks.</p>
        <p>The industry's problem, analysts and institutional investors say, has been the weather. Parts of the New York metropolitan area had 10 consecutive rainy days extending into last week, putting a damper on one of Six Flags' largest and most profitable operations, a cluster of three parks in central New Jersey -- Great Adventure, Wild Safari and Hurricane Harbor. After that rainy stretch, analysts at Merrill Lynch and Salomon Smith Barney lowered their estimates for 2000 operating income for the company, as well as their price targets for the stock.</p>
        <p>''If someone delayed visiting the park in June, we thought they would make it up in July because a visit is usually delayed instead of canceled,'' said Hayley Kissel, the Merrill analyst. ''But the last week of July was an absolute washout, and that's making it harder and harder to make it up.''</p>
        <p>Last week, Ms. Kissel lowered her estimate for 2000 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, to about $400 million, or about $2.28 a share, from her earlier one of $435 million, or $2.47 a share. Still, she maintains a buy rating on the stock, but has lowered her 52-week price target to $27 from $34. ''They've had severe weather, but that doesn't change the fundamentals or the operating model,'' she said.</p>
        <p>For the last two years, the company has developed a reputation as an amusement park consolidator, buying older, underperforming parks cheaply, spending money to add attractions and spruce them up and branding them with the well-recognized Six Flags name. That has helped the company increase cash flow steeply, said Cliff Greenberg, portfolio manager for the Baron Small Cap fund, which owns about a million shares of Six Flags.</p>
        <p>''Ideally, they're going to buy additional parks in the U.S. and do the same thing,'' Mr. Greenberg said, adding that there are ''also opportunities in Mexico and Europe.'' He said that at six to seven times 2001 Ebitda estimates, the stock was attractive. ''It's not just about this year, but next year and the prospects beyond,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But some large investors are clearly skittish. On July 25, just after Cedar Fair's warning, 3.77 million shares of Six Flags traded hands, and the stock fell  to a 52-week low of $13.93. And short interest in the stock, which stood at 5.37 million shares as of July 10, remains high.</p>
        <p>Several analysts criticized Six Flags executives for not doing more to allay investors' fears. But others say that considering the importance of any given weekend, management could not have done much before announcing second-quarter numbers.</p>
        <p>''The conclusion is that if Cedar Fair lowered their guidance then Six Flags will probably do the same,'' said Kathy Styponias, senior entertainment analyst at Prudential Securities. ''But at this point, it's unclear if that will be.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Styponias said she believed that any bad news was priced into the stock, which she rates as a strong buy with a 52-week target of $48.</p>
