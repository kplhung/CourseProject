        <p>Staten Island is now the epicenter of the West Nile virus, according to the borough president, although many residents are not taking extraordinary precautions to avoid becoming infected.</p>
        <p>''The West Nile problem is primarily a Staten Island problem,'' the borough president, Guy Molinari, said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Of the 31 infected birds found in New York City, 26 were on Staten Island, said John Gadd, a City Health Department spokesman. Of three pools found with infected mosquitoes, one was in Central Park and two were on Staten Island.</p>
        <p>Staten Island residents have been encouraged to call (718) 816-2000 to report sightings of dead birds.</p>
        <p>''The evidence of infected birds in upstate New York suggests it may be moving northward,'' said Tom Skinner, a spokesman for the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. On Friday, the state health commissioner confirmed a statewide outbreak of the virus.</p>
        <p>Since the end of May, Staten Island University Hospital has treated 13 patients with symptoms that could have been caused by the virus, but only one case, an elderly man's, has been confirmed, said Brian Morris, a hospital spokesman.</p>
        <p>The 78-year-old Staten Island man  was the first person in the United States to have become infected with the virus this season. The man, whose name was not released, has returned home.</p>
        <p>Mr. Morris said the patient, though among those most at risk from the virus, was doing well.</p>
        <p>''He is older and more frail,'' Mr. Morris said. But he is ''90 percent better.'' At his sickest, the man had a  temperature of 104.7, a stiff neck and mental confusion, Mr. Morris said.</p>
        <p>Staten Island was sprayed on July 19 and 24 and again on Wednesday.  Health Department officials believe that the spraying killed 90 percent of the mosquitoes, Mr. Molinari said, but ''only in areas we've been able to reach.''</p>
        <p>One problem, he said, is that Staten Island has ''tons and tons of wetlands, creeks and tributaries,'' and spraying from the road does not reach all of these areas.</p>
        <p>Of more than a dozen people walking around the Westerly neighborhood yesterday morning, only one was wearing the long pants and shirt recommended by health officials as armor against the mosquitoes that carry the virus.</p>
        <p>Artie Quadrino, 59, a salesman from the New Springville section of Staten Island, said he was dressed that way because he was working.</p>
        <p>Yshana Gambrell, 21, an administrative assistant from the New Brighton neighborhood, was out with her 5-year-old son. She was not very worried about the virus, either.</p>
        <p>''My son and I are indoors during the day, and when he's not, I use bug spray on him,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Laura Esposito, 49, of Westerly  said she was not worried for herself, but for her father, who is 86.</p>
        <p>''I always make sure that he sprays himself during the day when he goes out, because he's most susceptible to it,'' Ms. Esposito said.</p>
        <p>The virus, which can cause flulike symptoms and, at its most dangerous stages, encephalitis, a potentially fatal brain inflammation, is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes. It has spread into Connecticut and  Massachusetts in birds that have been bitten by infected mosquitoes. The elderly, children and people with weakened immune systems are most susceptible to infection, but not everyone in those categories who is bitten by an infected mosquito will develop symptoms, according to the C.D.C.</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 17, 2000, Thursday  An article on Aug. 6 about the reaction of Staten Island residents to the outbreak of West Nile virus in the borough misspelled the name of a neighborhood. It is Westerleigh, not Westerly.</p>
