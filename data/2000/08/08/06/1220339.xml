        <p>Deerhurst Resort, a luxurious lakeside 425-room hotel in the Muskoka region of Ontario, a two-and-a-half-hour drive north of Toronto, has opened for this season after a $12.3 million expansion.</p>
        <p>The new owners, Massachusetts Mutual Insurance Company, acquired the late 19th-century resort in 1998 and spent 18 months adding a 102-room wing, a grand ballroom and a solarium-enclosed swimming pool near Peninsula Lake. A floor-to-ceiling stone fireplace dominates the new lobby.  In the adjoining bar, slate floors and intricately milled, lodge-style woodwork echo the building's new stone and timber facade. Eclipse, the newest of Deerhurst's three restaurants, offers views of Sunset Bay from a wraparound porch.</p>

        <p>Deerhurst Resort, a luxurious lakeside 425-room hotel in the Muskoka region of Ontario, a two-and-a-half-hour drive north of Toronto, has opened for this season after a $12.3 million expansion.</p>
        <p>The new owners, Massachusetts Mutual Insurance Company, acquired the late 19th-century resort in 1998 and spent 18 months adding a 102-room wing, a grand ballroom and a solarium-enclosed swimming pool near Peninsula Lake. A floor-to-ceiling stone fireplace dominates the new lobby.  In the adjoining bar, slate floors and intricately milled, lodge-style woodwork echo the building's new stone and timber facade. Eclipse, the newest of Deerhurst's three restaurants, offers views of Sunset Bay from a wraparound porch.</p>
        <p>Summer diversions at the resort include kayaking, canoeing, sailing and tennis; winter guests can cross-country ski on the 800-acre property. There are two 18-hole golf courses, including Deerhurst Highlands, with dramatic shifts in terrain that include a 30-foot rock wall on one hole.</p>
        <p>Once the preserve of wealthy American industrialists -- one stretch along Lake Muskoka is called Millionaire's Row -- the Muskoka region is known as much for its cottages and lavish summer estates as for its 1,600 lakes, sheer granite cliffs and maple forests.</p>
        <p>Rooms at Deerhurst range from $88  to $225, at $1.47 Canadian to the U.S. dollar; multiroom suites cost as much as $463.  For information and reservations, (800) 461-4393.</p>
