        <p>The ancient oval seems as wide and smooth as a boulevard, but the Indianapolis Motor Speedway snatched another victory from a driver who thought he had the great racetrack figured out.</p>
        <p>Today it was Rusty Wallace's turn to go home baffled. He led 110 laps of the Brickyard 400, but failed to make enough of an adjustment in his powerful Ford on his last pit stop to deal with the thickening clouds and the rapidly changing track temperature.</p>
        <p>Wallace lost enough handling in his car to enable Bobby Labonte to pass him on the 146th of 160 laps. Labonte, the Nascar Winston Cup points leader, rolled on to a 4.3-second victory -- about 20 car lengths -- over Wallace and got to stand on the roof of his car in Victory Lane afterward and do a funky victory stomp.</p>
        <p>''It really threw me for a surprise,'' Labonte said. ''I didn't think I was going to get him all day.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Wallace was second-guessing himself for failing to tweak the tire pressure and aerodynamics on his Ford. In essence, his car became too difficult to steer. Wallace had the horsepower to win the race, but not the handling.</p>
        <p>''I couldn't shake that 18,'' Wallace said, referring to Labonte by his car number, ''and I knew I had a tiger by the tail then.''</p>
        <p>Labonte, who stretched his lead over Dale Jarrett in the overall points standing to a healthy 85, posted a winning average speed of 155.918 miles an hour, a record for this seven-year-old event.</p>
        <p>Neither the points nor his speed seemed to matter much to Labonte after the race. He won his first race at Indianapolis today, which superseded everything. He also got a chance to celebrate briefly on pit road with his older brother Terry, whose 21-year streak of 655 Winston Cup starts came to an end because of the effects of a concussion.</p>
        <p>Labonte's late pass was one of the few highlights on a quiet day, at least by Nascar's brassy standards. There were only two caution periods, covering seven laps, and only five drivers held the lead.</p>
        <p>The top subplot of the afternoon, Darrell Waltrip's last ride at the Brickyard, ended quietly.</p>
        <p>Waltrip, 53, who had qualified for the front row of the starting grid on Thursday, finished 11th, a season best, but failed to seize the lead from the pole-sitter Ricky Rudd at the start of the race, which would have fired up the capacity crowd.</p>
        <p>Asked if he considered conspiring with Rudd to take the lead, Waltrip wrinkled his nose, then replied, ''I told him, 'Don't you dare change what you'd do for me. That would mess me up.' ''</p>
        <p>Labonte started behind Rudd, but thought he was capable of winning the race. That meant he would have had to pass a number of other cars -- quite an adventure for the heavy stock cars at Indianapolis.</p>
        <p>Cars running in the open are fine, as Wallace and Labonte said after the race, but the aerodynamics create enough of a disturbance for the trailing cars to make it almost impossible to pass.</p>
        <p>That makes race car minutiae vital, even down to the air pressure in the tires.</p>
        <p>''You don't think a pound of air would make a difference,'' said Bill Elliott, who finished third today, ''but sometimes that can make all the difference.''</p>
        <p>Wallace, who started 10th today,  took the lead on the 19th lap, and it appeared as if no one would, or could, catch him. That would be the one positive that Wallace's crew chief, Robin Pemberton, would take away from this race.</p>
        <p>''At least we know we can dominate,'' Pemberton said. ''People can criticize us all they want, but at least we're in a position to give them away.''</p>
        <p>Even after Labonte made his final pit stop and barely wheeled his fluorescent green Pontiac on the track, Wallace surged past Labonte on the 123rd lap and held onto the lead by blocking him constantly.</p>
        <p>''All I saw was blue car all day long, it seemed like,'' Labonte said, referring to Wallace's Ford.</p>
        <p>Finally, Wallace gave Labonte precious room to pass. Labonte, seeing a crack, pulled next to Wallace near Turn 3 of the two-and-one-half-mile oval. Coming out of the fourth turn, the two cars bumped.</p>
        <p>Labonte, laughing, said the bump was a lot harder than it might have looked on television or to the crowd estimated at 325,000. But he gathered himself and pulled away.</p>
        <p>''Once he got that clean air and he could turn the car perfectly, it was just a matter of him running off,'' Wallace said.</p>
        <p>And that is exactly what Labonte did. He and his crew earned the right afterward to engage in the tradition of kissing the strip of bricks at the speedway's start-finish line.</p>
        <p>''That was a great thrill for me -- a great experience,'' said Labonte's crew chief, Jimmy Makar.</p>
        <p>It was also an unexpected experience, if one listened to Labonte long enough. ''All in all, I didn't think it was going to be a bad day,'' Labonte said. ''Only it was better.''</p>
