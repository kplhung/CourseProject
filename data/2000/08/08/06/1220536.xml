        <p>This is what Anton Chekhov said about news reporters in a letter to a friend written around 1888: ''The word newspaper-writer means, at the very least, a scoundrel. I am one of them. I work with them. I shake hands with them. I'm even told that I've begun to look like one. But I shan't die as one.''</p>
        <p>According to Chekhov, the miscreance of newspapermen is an organic problem, something rotten in the blood, as ineluctable as bitterness and bad skin. The secret villainy of journalists? Their helplessness before the two worst poisons known to man: self-importance and cheap drinks.</p>

        <p>This is what Anton Chekhov said about news reporters in a letter to a friend written around 1888: ''The word newspaper-writer means, at the very least, a scoundrel. I am one of them. I work with them. I shake hands with them. I'm even told that I've begun to look like one. But I shan't die as one.''</p>
        <p>According to Chekhov, the miscreance of newspapermen is an organic problem, something rotten in the blood, as ineluctable as bitterness and bad skin. The secret villainy of journalists? Their helplessness before the two worst poisons known to man: self-importance and cheap drinks.</p>
        <p>At Siberia, a boozy little cubbyhole  carved from the scummy tiles of the 50th Street subway station, there were plenty of newspaper writers indulging in the cheap drinks recently.</p>
        <p>Buds and Rolling Rocks were going fast at four bucks a pop. But by midnight, the hacks getting drunk in the red-fluorescent gloom were almost too polluted to be smug.</p>
        <p>Though the landlord wants to kick Siberia out in October -- a skyscraper is to be built atop it -- the bar has been a hangout for reporters since it opened in 1996. The New York Post comes here, as does The Associated Press. The writers like its downtrodden, slumming-in-the-underground appeal. They like that you can see a bank of turnstiles from the front door. They like the smokiness and wet-dog smell. The place reminds them of the dissolute dreams they had before getting older, getting jobs and getting a taste of the temporary immortality of the reporter's life.</p>
        <p>Tracy Westmoreland, the owner, is a beefy, fast-talking jokester. Tosses around free beers like the jabs he once threw as an amateur boxer. Jumpy as a pogo stick. A big, chesty, teddy-bear-turned-tavern-owner type.</p>
        <p>Tracy loves reporters, loves their way with words, and loves being known as the guy they come to when they want to cut loose on a Friday night. ''First six months I was open,'' he says, ''it was free drinks for every journalist who walked through the door.'' It's a bit more selective now, but not much.</p>
        <p>Considering that so many folks drinking in Siberia's ''parents on vacation so let's bash in the basement'' decor were ladies and gents of the press, it seemed to make sense to leave a pen and notebook hanging about and allow writerly instinct and bottled beer to take its course.</p>
        <p>''Drinking, like journalism, is too much today, too little tomorrow,'' one veteran A.P. hand wrote, somewhat alcoholically. ''Drinking, like journalism,'' he tried in his next observation, ''is a step toward the perfect romance, where words about love intersect with thoughts unattainable without one more question, one more drink.''</p>
        <p>While the copy was pretty good overall, it was clear that not everyone in the room made his or her living in the news trade. There was, for example, the pleasantly down-to-earth woman at the bar, who appeared a little shopworn by the end of the night.</p>
        <p>''Look, I'm not one of these journo-types,'' she said, her nose wrinkled in disdain. ''I'm a librarian. A normal person.'</p>
