        <p>Amateur astronomers and other sky watchers will have a new West Coast spot to stargaze from when the Chabot Space and Science Center, an 86,000-square-foot facility in the hills of Oakland, Calif., opens Aug. 19.</p>
        <p>While the center covers a broad range of sciences, the focus is on astronomy and space exploration. An observatory complex houses 8- and 20-inch refractor telescopes (the bigger the telescope, the clearer the view) that were relocated from the center's former facility. A new 36-inch reflector, one of the largest public telescopes in the country, will be installed sometime next year.</p>

        <p>Amateur astronomers and other sky watchers will have a new West Coast spot to stargaze from when the Chabot Space and Science Center, an 86,000-square-foot facility in the hills of Oakland, Calif., opens Aug. 19.</p>
        <p>While the center covers a broad range of sciences, the focus is on astronomy and space exploration. An observatory complex houses 8- and 20-inch refractor telescopes (the bigger the telescope, the clearer the view) that were relocated from the center's former facility. A new 36-inch reflector, one of the largest public telescopes in the country, will be installed sometime next year.</p>
        <p>Live and recorded star shows will be presented in a 240-seat planetarium equipped with one of the world's most advanced star projectors, capable of creating more than 9,000 points of light using fiber optics. The inaugural show is ''The Soul of the Night,'' a 35-minute presentation featuring constellations, the Milky Way, laser graphics and a musical soundtrack. A separate 210-seat, dome-screened theater will be used for a changing selection of 70-millimeter films.</p>
        <p>In the galleries, visitors can walk through full-size mockups of International Space Station modules and learn about  planetary landscapes and meteorites. One exhibit recreates the Earth's changing atmosphere, oceans and continents through a 3-D device called a Hologlobe, on permanent loan from the Smithsonian Institution.</p>
        <p>The center is at 10000 Skyline Boulevard. Admission $8, $5.50 ages 65 and over and 4 to 12; separate planetarium or theater tickets are $8.75, $6.50 seniors and children. Combination tickets including either the planetarium or theater are $14.75, $11 seniors and children; tickets including both are $19.75, $15.50 children.</p>
        <p>There is no charge for the telescopes, which are positioned by staff members and are open to the public on Friday and Saturday evenings. Information: (510) 530-3480; www.chabotspace.org.</p>
