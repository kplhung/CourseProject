        <p>Dancing in Paris</p>
        <p>Q. When I go to Paris this fall, I'd like to find places for ballroom dancing. Can you tell me of any? -- Robert Vitullo, Somerville, N.J.</p>
        <p>A. There are several dance hall restaurants, known as guinguettes, lining the Marne River east of Paris. In towns like Joinville-le-Pont or Champigny-sur-Marne, about 30 minutes from the center of Paris by car or the R.E.R. A train in the direction of Boissy St.-Leger, a number of guinguettes with live orchestras offer the opportunity to cha-cha, waltz, rumba and salsa.</p>

        <p>Dancing in Paris</p>
        <p>Q. When I go to Paris this fall, I'd like to find places for ballroom dancing. Can you tell me of any? -- Robert Vitullo, Somerville, N.J.</p>
        <p>A. There are several dance hall restaurants, known as guinguettes, lining the Marne River east of Paris. In towns like Joinville-le-Pont or Champigny-sur-Marne, about 30 minutes from the center of Paris by car or the R.E.R. A train in the direction of Boissy St.-Leger, a number of guinguettes with live orchestras offer the opportunity to cha-cha, waltz, rumba and salsa.</p>
        <p>Le Petit Robinson and Chez Gegene, next to each other in Joinville-le-Pont, draw large crowds on Friday and Saturday evenings and Sunday afternoons, where admission for dancing, including a drink, is about  $14.30, at 7 francs to the dollar. L'Ile du Martin Pecheur, farther out on a small island in the Marne, has a live orchestra for dancers on Sunday between 3 and 7 P.M. but is open Wednesday through Saturday from noon to 2 A.M. with recorded music.</p>
        <p>The atmosphere at these guinguettes is relaxed and informal, with dancers of all levels. The dance halls  serve basic French food, with a three-course meal costing about $30, without alcohol.</p>
        <p>La Coupole cafe, 102, boulevard du Montparnasse, (33-1) 43.20.14.20, has a legendary tango evening every Tuesday in its dancing space on the lower level. One-hour lessons begin at 8:45 P.M. and cost $13 a person. The soiree, with live orchestra, is from 10 p.m. to 3 a.m. and costs $14.30 each, with a drink included.</p>
        <p>While reservations for dinner at these places is recommended, none is needed for dancing.</p>
        <p>If you want work on your moves before going out, the Marais Dance Center, 41, rue du Temple, (33-1) 42.72.15.42, offers dance classes weeknights for about $13 a class.</p>

        <p>Hudson Valley Drive</p>
        <p>Q. We will be visiting New York soon, and want to drive up the Hudson to Albany, visiting Franklin D. Roosevelt's home. Do you have other ideas for historic sites to visit and scenic routes? -- K. Charney, Seattle</p>
        <p>A. The Franklin D. Roosevelt Home National Historic Site, on Route 9 in in Hyde Park, is only one of dozens of attractions in the Hudson River Valley. From the Bronx, the Hudson Valley covers some 130 miles of green hills, dramatic cliffs and rolling farmland to Albany.</p>
        <p>A nice drive starts by crossing the Hudson into New Jersey at the George Washington Bridge and following the Palisades Parkway about 45 miles to Bear Mountain State Park, (914) 786-2701. There is a $5 parking fee, and the zoo costs $1 to enter. But you can stop free at the peak for views that can include a squinting glimpse of Manhattan.</p>
        <p>A few miles north is the United States Military Academy at West Point, (845) 938-2638. You can stroll the campus or visit the military museum (free), or take a guided tour ($6). Staying on the west side of the river brings you to Storm King Art Center in Mountainville ($7), (845) 534-3115, an outdoor sculpture museum with 120 modern works by Calder, Nevelson, Noguchi and others.</p>
        <p>Should you cross the river at the Bear Mountain Bridge and head north on Route 9D, you'll soon come upon the Boscobel Restoration, (845) 265-3638. This 1806 Federal mansion on beautifully landscaped grounds overlooking the Hudson is open for tours ($8, $5 just for the grounds).</p>
        <p>To get to Hyde Park, go east to Route 9 then north through Poughkeepsie. With reservations, from (845) 471-6608, you might dine at one of the five Culinary Institute of America restaurants before seeing Roosevelt's home ($10), and Val-Kill  ($5), Eleanor Roosevelt's retreat.  Also just up Route 9 is the Vanderbilt Mansion National Historic Site ($8), an eye-popping look at the robber-baron life style. A ticket for all three homes cost $18; information, (845) 229-9115.</p>
        <p>Continuing up Route 9 brings you to Rhinebeck, with America's oldest operating inn, the Beekman Arms, (800) 361-6517, and its 1776 Restaurant, (845) 871-1766. The Old Rhinebeck Aerodrome ($5, $10 weekends), a few miles east, exhibits historic airplanes, puts on air shows and even offers rides in a 1929 open-cockpit biplane ($30 for 15 minutes); (845) 752-3200.</p>
        <p>North of Rhinebeck are more historic homes, like Olana, (518) 828-0135, the Moorish mansion of the artist Frederick Church, on Route 9G in Hudson ($3 to tour the house), and the Martin Van Buren National Historic Site ($2 for tours), (518) 758-9689, on Route 9H in Kinderhook.</p>
        <p>For more details about Hudson Valley attractions, call the New York State Travel Information Center, (800) 225-5697 or Hudson Valley Tourism, (800) 232-4782, or see www.enjoyhv.com, www.hvnet.com and www.go-hudsonvalley.com.</p>
        <p>Shipping Golf Clubs</p>
        <p>Q. My husband and I are taking a trip to Barcelona, Corsica and then Malaga, Spain, for a week of golf. Our first and last legs are on Iberia Airlines. How can he avoid carting his golf equipment the whole trip? -- Mary Jane Cote, New York, N.Y.</p>
        <p>A. Because you enter Spain in different cities your options are limited.  Iberia Airlines says you can ship your clubs as freight, separate from your ticket, to your final destination. The minimum price would be $95, and Iberia would hold a shipment up to four days for no extra charge. Beyond that, it would cost 10 cents a kilogram -- about 2.2 pounds -- a day. To find out more, call the Iberia cargo service, (800) 221-6002.</p>
        <p>But the cost of any international shipment can grow high because of taxes and import duties, warned John Flick, a spokesman for United Parcel Service. Those fees and the fact that shippers like U.P.S. focus on businesses can bring the bill for a sending a set of golf clubs by U.P.S. to well over $250, he said.</p>
        <p>U.P.S. has domestic service in Spain, and it could be considerably cheaper to take your clubs with you to Spain and ship them from Barcelona to your final destination, Mr. Flick said. You would have to get the clubs to the local U.P.S. center and have arranged with your hotel or resort to accept them. For more information, call the U.P.S international information number, (800) 782-7892.</p>
        <p>A Federal Express sales and marketing official, Ed Guiragos, estimated that five- or six-day delivery of the clubs to Spain would cost about $398. The company would hold the package up to five days at a Fedex World Services Center, but the company does not have such a center in Malaga. To talk to Fedex about your needs, call (800) 463-3339.</p>
