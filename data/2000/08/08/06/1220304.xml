        <p>Few Americans understand how hard it is for the federal government to exert any leverage on educational change. Most important places for imposing reform reside within of state governments. Nevertheless, responding to political dynamics, presidential candidates put education planks in their platforms. But their ideas, while perhaps attractive to voters, as well as to special-interest constituents, are probably useless in practice.</p>
        <p>Polls suggest Americans want better schools, although they may not agree about what ''better'' means or know what policies will work. Still, they believe education is crucial to their children's success, and they want elected leaders to be honest and to help with the details.</p>
        <p>Both major candidates, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Vice President Al Gore, have shown themselves to be sensitive to those wishes. Mr. Gore is sticking to a 1960's Democratic format of strong federal intervention in education issues. Mr. Bush, true to Republican traditions, relies upon financial incentives for state and individual action.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, neither candidate is capable of cutting to the core of America's educational problems. Mr. Gore's activist approach ignores the history of federal failures in setting education policies. Uncharacteristically for a Republican, Mr. Bush has also adopted an activist role for government, and his voucher proposals overlook public schools' historic successes.</p>
        <p>However, the problems are more in the structure of American educational governance than in policies that a president could change.</p>
        <p>There are three reasons that presidential candidates swim upstream when trying to promote federal education reform policies. They face constitutional, financial and practical impediments.</p>
        <p>First, the nation's constitution gives the federal government only the most restricted role in education. This is the antithesis of what happens in most countries, where the national government is the reigning education authority. Given the high levels of learning among the Constitution's framers, the restraint might seem ironic.</p>
        <p>However, America's founding fathers equated education so strongly with the ability to exercise influence and power that they made no mention of education or schooling in their final document. Governmental power was to be separated, not concentrated. Back then, it was thought that a federally directed school system was too great a centralization of power and at risk for abuse. Many American policy makers still agree with this position.</p>
        <p>The Constitution is equally silent regarding the government's paying for the education of private individuals and the financial support of private schools.</p>
        <p>The longstanding American compromise between the two extremes -- an overarching federal education system and a splintered and possibly socially divisive system of private schooling -- has been to empower states in education and to rely upon local school districts.</p>
        <p>States, not the federal government, have constitutional responsibility for determining what is taught in schools, what texts and instructional materials can be used in classrooms, what standardized tests, if any, will be administered to students, who will pay the bill for schooling, who can serve on school boards, how large districts will be, how many charter schools, if any, will exist and who is eligible to teach.</p>
        <p>This decentralized decision-making model has its costs. Fifty state systems, operating through almost 15,000 local school districts, present an awesome obstacle to those impatient to achieve fundamental change. However, this complexity would also present an awesome impediment to the brainwashing aspirations of any prospective despot.</p>
        <p>The federal government is only a minor contributor to American education budgets. Federal money pays only approximately six cents out of every nationwide education dollar, an amount insufficient to gain leverage over important parts of the system. With America now spending close to $2 billion each day to operate its schools, federal revenue appropriations keep the nation's schools open only about two to three weeks of each year.</p>
        <p>Finally, presidential candidates are hampered by the post-World-War-II history of substantial federal education failure.</p>
        <p>The last true ''education president'' was Lyndon Baines Johnson. His hopes for improving American education were idealistic and intense. Still, his activist federal legacy has proven to be more disruptive and wasteful than positive.</p>
        <p>Johnson's ''war on poverty'' education programs relied upon highly specific government regulations to ensure that federal funds were exclusively used for the benefit of low-income students. This strategy succeeded in getting the federal money to the eligible students. It also ripped apart the operational integrity of many of America's public schools, particularly large city systems.</p>
        <p>Poor children supported by federal funds were assigned for part of the day to specialized classrooms. Thereafter, neither their regular nor special teacher was held accountable for their learning. Each pointed the finger of accountability at the other. Moreover, the school principal was now beholden to both the school district hierarchy and the federal government bureaucracy.</p>
        <p>Legislative and administrative changes have begun to ameliorate this condition. However, it did not happen until many of the nation's schools experienced 30 years of unproductive turmoil.</p>
        <p>A similarly dismal story could be told regarding federal efforts involving special education, vocational education, racial desegregation and subsidies for students' cafeteria meals. Both Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore are making proposals that fly in the face of these historic federal government limitations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore appears willing to gloss over conventional wisdom regarding a limited federal education role. He caters to teachers' union supporters by pledging anticipated government budget surpluses to raise teacher pay through a federal stipend, to have a vastly expanded Federal Teacher Corps and to have a major federal government influence over teacher licensing standards.</p>
        <p>In a speech in Michigan in May, Mr. Gore said, ''I will ensure that there is a fully qualified, well-trained teacher in every single classroom, everywhere in this nation, by the end of the next four years.''</p>
        <p>If he wins the Presidency, Mr. Gore had better hope the public has a short memory, lest this promise become the embarrassing analog of President Bush's infamous ''read my lips'' promise regarding tax increases. Neither the money nor the necessary political consensus is likely be present to enable Mr. Gore to fulfill his promise of good teachers everywhere.</p>
        <p>If history is a guide, a dominant federal government presence in a crucial operating sphere such as teacher recruitment, training, licensing, pay or placement would portend disaster.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, while offering no such sweeping promise, does propose a federal government reading program, based upon successes he has had in Texas. States and districts accepting federal funds would have to follow a federally specified set of strategies for teaching reading. This is hardly a states-rights, federal-government-hands-off approach.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush further steps outside traditional boundaries by advocating use of federal education funds for private school support. This is similar to the plan of his brother, Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, for schools in his state that perform poorly. This modified voucher plan is not a central feature of the Bush platform, but it is notable for its departure from convention.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's voucher sentiments are admirable. Poor children should not bear the burden of failing schools anymore than should the children of the wealthy who can afford to buy their way out of low-performing public schools.</p>
        <p>Practically, however, the idea is unproven and risky. It might jeopardize the secular status quo that protects America from the religious warfare plaguing such areas as Northern Ireland and Kosovo.</p>
        <p>If an activist federal role may be useless and vouchers for private schooling are untried, what can be done? What should a president expect to accomplish for American education? There are three answers.</p>
        <p>Exhortation: The president should mount the bully pulpit and admonish officials to change the education system. As hollow as it sometimes sounds to those unversed in history, the federal government's ability to influence state and local reform agendas is substantial. Ronald Reagan was hardly an activist president when it came to education. However, he and his education secretary, William Bennett, provoked much of the current reform movement by taking advantage of the ''A Nation At Risk'' task force report to browbeat education officials into setting higher standards.</p>
        <p>Equalization: Certain states are insufficiently wealthy to provide an adequate education to their students, even when they tax themselves fairly. That is where selected block grants would make sense. States such as Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, Louisiana and New Mexico actually would benefit from federal funding for programs such as preschool education and school construction.</p>
        <p>Inquiry: There is almost no powerful research conducted about important education matters. America's philanthropic foundations have virtually abandoned the field of serious inquiry in favor of supporting will-o'-the-wisp fads that ultimately only reinforce the status quo. The class-size study supported by Tennessee stands out as one of the nation's rare inquiries into an important education topic. However, one cannot depend upon individual states to support the scientific inquiry that the entire nation desperately needs. This too is an important and appropriate federal role.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the big news here is that candidates from both major parties are willing to forego conventional federal government education roles. The question then becomes whether they are in tune with the rest of the nation's policy makers, governors and state legislators.</p>
