        <p>Former President Gerald R. Ford underwent successful surgery in a Philadelphia hospital today to relieve swelling in his tongue from a rare bacterial infection, his doctors said.</p>
        <p>The infection was unrelated to the stroke that caused Mr. Ford to be admitted to Hahnemann University Hospital last week during the Republican National Convention, doctors said.</p>
        <p>Doctors said the 87-year-old former president was on a path to full recovery from both the stroke and the abscess in his tongue, and was resting comfortably. A biopsy showed no sign of a tumor causing the pain and swelling in his tongue, the hospital reported. Doctors said the condition was a case of a bacterial infection known as actinomycosis, a common oral bacillus that rarely attacks the tongue.</p>
        <p>The abscess was drained, easing the swelling considerably, doctors said. Mr. Ford received a general anesthetic for the 25-minute procedure and, after about 30 minutes of recovery, returned to his room where he was reported to be alert as he was greeted by his wife, Betty, and his family.</p>
        <p>''He's now, I think, completely recovered from his small stroke,'' said Dr. Robert J. Schwartzman, the hospital's chief neurologist, who added that Mr. Ford's blood-thinning drugs were still being adjusted. ''As soon as that is accomplished he should be ready to go home.''</p>
        <p>The pocket of infection deep within the tongue was described as an exceedingly rare condition with so little precedent that the doctors declined to speculate on how the tongue became infected. The doctors and Mr. Ford's spokesman, Calvin McDowell, unofficially referred to it as ''the president's syndrome'' in discussing it at a news conference.</p>
        <p>''There simply aren't enough cases for us to draw conclusions in the medical literature,'' said Dr. Richard Hayden, chairman of the hospital's department of otolaryngology, who performed the surgical procedure on Mr. Ford.</p>
        <p>''His comfort level is markedly improved and his speech has come back,'' Dr. Hayden said.</p>
        <p>After being saluted at the convention on Tuesday night, Mr. Ford later went to the hospital and told doctors he was suffering acute facial pain. He was told he probably had a bad sinus infection and was given some antibiotics and released.</p>
        <p>But after a sleepless night, Mr. Ford returned to the hospital on Wednesday morning. The symptoms were worse, he told doctors, and besides pain included dizziness, numbness and an inability to speak without slurring words.</p>
        <p>Tests indicated that he had suffered at least one mild stroke in the rear portion of the brain that controls basic functions like balance, speech and swallowing, doctors said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ford was admitted to the neurological intensive care unit and, after a day of treatment that included blood-thinning drugs, doctors reported that he was doing much better and could expect a full recovery.</p>
        <p>With Mr. Ford neurologically stable, the doctors decided to treat the tongue abscess this morning. As part of the treatment after the surgery, Mr. Ford began taking antibiotics. Dr. Hayden said he expected a full recovery over the next several weeks, with Mr. Ford to be treated as an outpatient after he returns home.</p>
