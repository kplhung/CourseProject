        <p>Seeking a Keeper of Traditions</p>
        <p>Wanted: full-time folklorist to run the Westchester Arts Council's folk art program. Abundant opportunities, authentic locales. Apply now! Time running out for program designed to help preserve traditional crafts and practices.</p>
        <p>''We've advertised nationally, but it's a very specialized kind of field,'' Janet T. Langsam, the council's executive director, said. ''It's not offered at every college.'' She defined a folklorist as a specialist who studies, documents, interprets and displays the culture of everyday life.</p>
        <p>Marion S. Jacobson was the council's folklorist until recently, when she left to complete her doctoral dissertation in Yiddish culture. Unless a replacement is found in the next few weeks, Ms. Langsam said, the council could lose a $25,000 grant from the State Council for the Arts.</p>
        <p>The term folk art may conjure up patchwork quilts and weather vanes, but the council's scope is more worldly. Ms. Jacobson, for example, documented Irish music and dancing in Yonkers and White Plains, Mexican pinata-making in Yonkers, Japanese crafts in Scarsdale and Hartsdale and Haitian dancing in New Rochelle. Other research focused on Italian stone cutters, whose handiwork is visible in walls and terraces throughout Westchester.</p>
        <p>The council also held an Irish house party to spotlight ''ceili'' dancing, and was a co-sponsor of the Cinco de Mayo festival last spring in Yonkers, which featured carnival dancers in costumes and masks.</p>
        <p>''These are disappearing arts,'' Ms. Langsam said. ''How will the traditions be passed on?''</p>
        <p>Leaving the Museum Behind</p>
        <p>Philip Verre, director of the Hudson River Museum in Yonkers, has the river practically flowing through his veins. Raised riverside in Sleepy Hollow, formerly North Tarrytown, where he currently lives, he is accustomed to riverboats and barges passing outside his office window.</p>
        <p>But after 10 years at the museum, Mr. Verre is moving on. He will leave Westchester after Labor Day to become the deputy director of the High Museum of Art in Atlanta. A six-member search committee has begun looking nationwide for his successor. The High Museum is devoted to fine arts with a focus on 19th-  and 20th-century European and American art. Mr. Verre said the museum also had strong collections in the decorative and folk arts.</p>
        <p>The recent controversy over the ownership of a Jasper Cropsey landscape, which the Hudson River Museum has held in safekeeping, had nothing to do with his decision, Mr. Verre said. ''That's just in the course of doing business,'' he said, adding that ownership of the painting would probably be determined in the fall. The Hastings-on-Hudson school district and the village of Hastings both claim to have inherited the work, and the museum has refused to release the painting until the dispute is settled.</p>
        <p>Mr. Verre said he leaves with a feeling of pride for the museum's recent $2 million  renovation of the Glenview Mansion, which offers a multimedia view of daily social and domestic life at the end of the 19th century, and for his role in strengthening the museum's exhibitions and public programs.</p>
        <p>''I've enjoyed working with such a variety of people, from school kids to volunteers to elected officials,'' he said, adding, ''Ill miss the river valley.''</p>
        <p>Twitches Before Flashes of Insight</p>
        <p>How often and easily the words slip out:  ''pain in the neck,'' ''no leg to stand on,'' ''beside myself.'' Cliches, to be sure, but fertile territory for Annegret Wolf Rice. ''There is so much more to these colloquial expressions than meets the eye,'' she said. ''So many phrases remind us of the body-mind connection.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Wolf Rice, a painter, writer and yoga teacher, sneaks up on writers' block with such expressions. In her course for the Hudson Valley Writers Center called ''Writing From the Bones,'' writers first sit quietly and listen to their bodies. Where does it hurt? Where is the strain? ''After awhile, someone may feel tense in the hips,'' she said. ''Any message in that place? That's something to work on.''</p>
        <p>The twitches lead to intuitive flashes, like ''Oh, I must call my mother-in-law!'' Eventually, she said, the twitches, tensions and flashes lead to core ideas that allow associations to flow.</p>
        <p>''Anything that needs healing comes out on the page,'' said Ms. Wolf Rice, who holds classes in her Sleepy Hollow yoga studio. Emotions are felt in the bones, she said. When this teacher tells you to stretch yourself, she means it literally.</p>
        <p>The class meets on Wednesdays from 9:30 to 11:30 a.m., Sept. 27 through Nov. 15. The cost is $230, or $195 for center members. The information number is (914) 631-2658.</p>
