      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Many readers responded to Peter Applebome's July 23 Soapbox column about racial mores and suburban manners at a gas station in Westchester County. The problem the column posed was what, if anything, to say to or do about the black gentleman sharing his expletive-laden music with the world and also Mr. Applebome's 9-year-old daughter.</p>
        <p>Here is a sampling of readers' reactions.</p>
        <p>1. I would have returned to my car, tuned my radio to WQXR, put it on high volume and changed pumps to the full-service bay and waited for an attendant. I would thus have shielded my ears and my daughter's from any unwelcome infringement on my pursuit of peace and quiet (you did say it was a Sunday afternoon).</p>

        <p>Here is a sampling of readers' reactions.</p>
        <p>1. I would have returned to my car, tuned my radio to WQXR, put it on high volume and changed pumps to the full-service bay and waited for an attendant. I would thus have shielded my ears and my daughter's from any unwelcome infringement on my pursuit of peace and quiet (you did say it was a Sunday afternoon).</p>
        <p>2. I would have returned to my car and driven to the next gas station .</p>
        <p>3. If the above two solutions do not please you for any reason, I am suggesting an alternative method: Invest in the purchase of a decibel meter reader. Record the level and determine if it is acceptable for the local laws. If not, use e-mail or your car phone, and report it to the police. The police have the responsibility for noise abatement and nuisance control.</p>
        <p>I am not suggesting this last choice tongue in cheek. You were concerned about racial confrontation. This will eliminate any possibility of such racism (and reverse racism too, as in a black person being offended by a non-black's reveries). For all you know, the police officers might be African-American, too. Infringement upon your peace, quiet and moments of happiness with your child is a matter for the police to handle.</p>
