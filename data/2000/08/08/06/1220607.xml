        <p>ONE of the enduring mysteries of the school shootings in places like Littleton, Colo., and West Paducah, Ky., is how so many people could have known so much but done so little to prevent bloodshed. The Columbine High School massacre, in which 15 people were killed, took place in April 1999. This May a 13-year-old boy fatally shot a teacher in Lake Worth, Fla.</p>
        <p>In case after case, the friends and acquaintances of the killers had heard boasts, muttered plans for mayhem or seen warning signs, like a fascination with guns, that may have seemed dissonant even in communities of sportsmen and firearms. But they did nothing to stop the crimes.</p>
        <p>The recently released testimony of teenagers who knew one such killer provides some explanation. At 14, Michael Carneal killed three girls and injured five other students when he opened fire on a prayer group at Heath High School in West Paducah, Ky., on Dec. 1, 1997.</p>
        <p>The following excerpts are from depositions of the teenagers that were filed in a civil damage suit in McCracken County Circuit Court in Paducah. The questioner, in most instances, is Mike Breen, a lawyer for the parents of the three murdered girls, Nicole Hadley, Kayce Steger and Jessica James. The parents sued more than 50 people, including many of the teenagers who knew Mr. Carneal, claiming that they could have prevented the killings or, in some cases, that they had helped plan them. The judge, William L. Shadoan, dismissed the suits, ruling that only the killer could be held liable for his crime. Mr. Carneal, now 17, is serving a life sentence after pleading guilty, saying he was mentally ill at the time of the shooting.</p>
        <p>WILLIAM GLABERSON</p>
        <p>Jeremy T. Ellis, a 10th grader at the time of the killings, describing Mr. Carneal, a friend from the school band:</p>
        <p>He was just this goofy kid that just did really silly stuff. And I liked that, because I'm a silly guy myself. . . . He told me, once or twice, that he thought it would be cool to walk -- or run -- down the halls shooting people. And he told me once he thought that it would be cool to go to prison. . . . He told me that he would, like, get keys to people's houses, and, like, just go up and unlock the door and, like, steal medication and stuff, and money from people's houses. . . . You, like, look back and you see all these little things that he did that were like, sort of like warning signs, sort of, but you didn't really realize them at the time. . . . At the time, I thought I knew him, you know. But then, like, after all this, I really didn't know him at all, because . . . like, this silly person was just a cover-up of this other guy.</p>
        <p>Matthew R. Neamon, a ninth grader, Mr. Carneal's friend since second grade.</p>
        <p>He brought a gun to school, and he showed it to me . . . the November before. . . . He had it in his backpack. . . . It was a pistol . . . semiautomatic. . . . He was like, ''Do you want to see something?'' And I was like, sure. And he showed it to me. And, ''Ooh, a gun.'' . . . There was a rumor on other days that he had one. . . . Just ''Michael has a gun.''</p>
        <p>Q. Was it against rules at school to have guns there?</p>
        <p>A. Yes.</p>
        <p>Q. Did you tell anybody about it?</p>
        <p>A. No.</p>
        <p>Q. Why not?</p>
        <p>A. Like I said, because I didn't want to get my friend in trouble.</p>
        <p>Amanda M. Jones, a ninth grader, was Michael's girlfriend the fall before the shootings.</p>
        <p>[He was] usually quiet, but then sometimes he would get noisy and annoying. . . . More when we were in high school, probably to fit in. . . . He got picked on a lot because he was small and -- I don't know -- he didn't play football, or anything. But a lot of freshmen got picked on. . . . He wasn't a big part of the jock population. . . . He just wasn't real tough and big. He was small. . . .. He was stranger than we are, more strange.</p>
        <p>Q. Did you ever hear Michael talk about taking over the school?</p>
        <p>A. Yeah. Not as in seriously. A lot of kids talk about taking over the school. . . . No one likes school, so. . . . Every school I've been to, someone would mention we should burn down the school. It's not strange for someone to not like school. . . . It was around Halloween, he brought a gun to school that he was trying to sell.</p>
        <p>Q. Do you know what kind of gun it was?</p>
        <p>A. A revolver? It's silver and the kind that has the spinny thing that comes out. . . . For some reason, it didn't strike me as odd.</p>
        <p>Q. Really?</p>
        <p>A. I just thought, well, he's trying to sell a gun. . . . I didn't really -- I didn't think, ''Oh, goodness, he's going to kill someone at school,'' because that just never had happened.</p>
        <p>William J. Alonso, a 12th grader, whose younger brother was a friend of Mr. Carneal.</p>
        <p>Q. He was [at your house] the Saturday before the shootings?</p>
        <p>A. Yes. . . . I talked to Michael Carneal. . . . His sister had told me that he was doing stuff with credit cards, buying stuff off the Internet with credit card numbers that were not his. And I warned him about getting in trouble and getting caught. And I told him that if he got caught, he had to shower in front of a bunch of guys, and probably wouldn't like that. That's about all I can remember of the discussion.</p>
        <p>Q. O.K. Did he have any weapons with him at the time?</p>
        <p>A. Yes, he did. . . . There was a handgun and some rifles. They were . . . on the floor, like, on a blanket type thing [in my brother's bedroom]. . . . There was no conversation about the guns.</p>
        <p>Q. You didn't say anything about them?</p>
        <p>A. No, I did not.</p>
        <p>Q. Did you tell anybody about the guns?</p>
        <p>A. No, I did not.</p>
        <p>Q. Why not?</p>
        <p>A. It didn't seem too out of place. . . .</p>
        <p>Q. You go in there to counsel Michael Carneal about other matters. You see other weapons there. You counsel Michael; is that right?</p>
        <p>A. Yes.</p>
        <p>Q. What does he say in response to that?</p>
        <p>A. Wait until Monday.</p>
        <p>Q. And how did you take that?</p>
        <p>A. I took it like he was going to pull a prank in school.</p>
        <p>Matthew T. Barnett, a 10th grader, another friend of Mr. Carneal.</p>
        <p>Q. I have a statement here that you gave to the police. . . . And it says . . . ''Michael Carneal said  we should go into [the school administration] office and shoot them while in their offices. Barnett responded 'Yeah, yeah,' but didn't think anything about it.'' . . . What was your reaction to that statement, when Carneal made it to you?</p>
        <p>A. Not much of one. It's just idle conversation.</p>
        <p>Q. You considered a statement that Michael Carneal wanted to go in and shoot school personnel an idle statement?</p>
        <p>A. Sure. I mean, I'm sure people, all over the place, say random things like that, you know, not meaning anything by them. You know, like, ''I really hate this,'' you know. And they don't mean anything by it. And people don't take them  seriously.</p>
        <p>Q. And so, people, according to you, don't take threats to murder like this seriously?</p>
        <p>A. It wasn't a threat to murder, though. . . . It was probably just us hanging around at school, at lunch.</p>
        <p>Alan W. Coleman, a 12th grader and friend of Mr. Carneal.</p>
        <p>[On the morning of the shootings] I arrived at school approximately 7:35 a.m. . . . Usually, I was there a little bit later. But I did get there to see what Michael was going to do. . . . Because he told us, on the Wednesday before  Thanksgiving, that he was going to do something. . . .</p>
        <p>Q. And you took him seriously enough, at least to the extent that you thought he was going to do something that was going to be worth watching, right?</p>
        <p>A. Yes.</p>
        <p>Q. And you showed up to school early that day so you could see?</p>
        <p>A. Yes.</p>
        <p>Q. All right. And during the time that you were thinking about this, between the Wednesday that he made the statement and the Monday morning that he actually did it, did you contact anybody about it and tell them?</p>
        <p>A. No.</p>
        <p>Q. Why not?</p>
        <p>A. I was expecting a practical joke of some sort. . . . Perhaps fireworks, water balloons, something of that nature.</p>
        <p>Toby Nace, a ninth grader, was once one of Mr. Carneal's best friends, although they had drifted apart.</p>
        <p>After we watched a movie, ''Basketball Diaries'' [which includes a fantasy of a violent school shooting], he said that would be neat to go in the school and shoot people that you don't like. . . . And he said, if you're going to take over the school, you could use those axes. . . . I just went along with him. I said, ''Yeah, if you're going to take over the school, you would have to cut the phone lines,'' or something. . . . He just did stuff to get attention.</p>
        <p>[The morning of the murders] I seen him put earplugs in, and [I] say, ''Hey, it would be funny if you wore those during class while the teacher is giving a speech.'' And he laughed. And then I just turned around. And then, when I turned back, he was pulling a gun out of his backpack.</p>
