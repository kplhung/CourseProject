        <p>IN certain circles, mostly among the younger, good-schools crowd, the conversation skips a beat when he says what he does. There are murmurs of curiosity, maybe. But no applause.</p>
        <p>Douglas George is a teacher. These days, he teaches history to students in grades 7 through 12 at the Choir Academy of Harlem, a small, alternative public school for students in the Harlem Boys Choir and the Girls Choir.</p>
        <p>Mr. George, a 26-year-old graduate of Duke University, said his choice of profession was considered odd for the usual reasons: not much money and not much glamour. And at a time when smart, college-educated African-American men like him are considered a commodity in certain job markets, his choice to forgo the professional and dot-com circuit puzzles some of his peers.</p>
        <p>''The question among my friends was, 'Do I go out and make my money for myself and then do something, or do I take a more active role, become a foot soldier in the community?' '' Mr. George said. ''More people, I think, went to the first option.</p>
        <p>''People hear you're a teacher and it's 'that's interesting,' or 'that's noble,' '' he said. ''I pick up the vibe 'I wouldn't do that.' ''</p>
        <p>Education and the dismal state of public schools are always on the short list of hot political topics, locally and nationally. That is especially true in this presidential election year. One of the questions up for consideration is how to attract the best minds to a profession that has been so denigrated in recent times? Is it just a matter of money?</p>
        <p>Particularly, how do schools attract so-called minority teachers to the big urban school systems where Asian, African-American and Hispanic students are decidedly not a minority?</p>
        <p>Here in New York, for instance, 64 percent of the public school teachers are white, about 32 percent are black or Hispanic and just under 3 percent are Asian, according to Board of Education statistics for the 1998-99 school year. Of the students that year, 15.5 percent were white, a bit over 73 percent were black or Hispanic and almost 11 percent were Asian.</p>
        <p>Only a ninny would argue that teachers have to be the same race or ethnicity as their students. But, likewise, it is hard to refute the argument that it helps students, especially those from struggling backgrounds, to have more teachers whose experience in the world more closely resembles their own.  Or that white students also need a chance to work with a more diverse group of adults.</p>
        <p>''There are certain intangibles that are a reality and are a legacy of what this country is,'' is how Mr. George put it.</p>
        <p>''My students have experienced racism. Maybe there is a bit more of a gravitation toward me,'' he said. ''Maybe there's a bit more of a leg up, an ease.''</p>
        <p>When he arrived at Duke in 1991, Mr. George considered himself a pre-law major. Mostly everyone he knew was pre-professional something. And although he tutored and took part in teaching programs, he felt torn between the desire to follow his heart and the push to acquire the traditional trappings of success.</p>
        <p>''There were recruiters from corporations,'' he said wryly. ''Schools don't come to campus.'' Mr. George was able to make the leap through a program sponsored by the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, a New York-based philanthropic organization.</p>
        <p>In 1992, the organization started the Fellowship Program for Minority Students Entering the Teaching Profession. Since then, the program has helped 150 students recruited from two dozen colleges and universities across the country. The students are given the money and personal support to become teachers.</p>
        <p>The program gave Mr. George more than $10,000 in financial aid, which he used to complete his master's in secondary education from Vanderbilt University in Nashville. It turned out to be more than just a matter of money, though. Even Mr. George took a couple of career detours.</p>
        <p>For a time, he worked with some former Duke classmates who went on to make millions for creating a simulated stock market for educators. And he worked on Wall Street at Oppenheimer Funds, in the marketing and communications department.</p>
        <p>During those days outside the classroom, he said, there was the sense from the larger world that he was doing what he was supposed to be doing with his life. He contrasted it with the time when, as a substitute teacher, a sixth grader asked why he was teaching, instead of pursuing law or medicine.</p>
        <p>Still, the fellowship newsletters kept coming. And he stayed in touch with fellows who were happy to be teaching. It was the personal support that pushed Mr. George, who lives on the same block in Canarsie where he grew up, back to teaching. He started at the Choir Academy two years ago and is looking forward to returning in the fall.</p>
        <p>In the end, it is about redefining what it means to be successful, Mr. George said. And what it means to make a contribution.</p>
        <p>''If I don't teach, who will?'' he said. ''Who's out there?''</p>
