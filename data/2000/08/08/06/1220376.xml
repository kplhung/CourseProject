        <p>Uggams in Comedy</p>
        <p>Leslie Uggams stars in the TheaterWorks production of the comedy ''The Old Settler'' by John Henry Redwood, opening in Hartford on Thursday and running through Sept. 17. She portrays one of two aging, church-going Harlem sisters in 1943 who rent a room in their apartment to a handsome young man newly arrived from the South. The play was originally presented at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford.</p>
        <p>Ms. Uggams has had a long career in show business, beginning at the age of 6 when she portrayed Ethel Waters's niece in the television series ''Beulah.'' After training at the New York Professional School and the Juilliard School, her range as an actress and singer brought her numerous nightclub engagements and roles on the stage, including ''Hallelujah Baby!'' for which she won a Tony award. Among her many television roles, her portrayal of Kizzy in ''Roots'' won a Critics Choice Award.</p>

        <p>TheaterWorks is at 233 Pearl Street. Performances are on Wednesday through Saturday at 8 p.m., Sunday at 7:30 p.m., and matinees on Saturday and Sunday at 2:30. For tickets, priced from $20 to $35, or more information, call (860) 527-7838.</p>
        <p>Disney Cels for Sale</p>
        <p>Disney production cels have acquired the status of collectible art in recent years. An exhibition and sale of more than 50 of them may be seen at the Greenwich Workshop Gallery in Fairfield through Aug. 19.</p>
        <p>Cels, for the benefit of the uninitiated, are the hand-painted animation drawings from which cartoon films are made. The examples in this exhibit, according to the gallery, have never before been released.</p>
        <p>They are mostly of individual characters rather than scenes from Disney films, including Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh, Tigger, Ariel and many others. One, from ''Mary Poppins,'' is signed by Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke, priced at $2,500. Small, unframed cels cost between $300 and $750. A framed limited edition piece from ''101 Dalmations'' costs $1,775.</p>
        <p>The gallery, at 1657 Post Road, is open Monday from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Tuesday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., Sunday from noon to 5 p.m., and on Thursday evening until 7:30. For more information, call (203) 255-4613.</p>
        <p>Steam Engine Launch Show</p>
        <p>The Third Annual Steam Engine and Launch Show will be in progress today from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the Connecticut River Museum in Essex. What's a launch? Think the African Queen upscaled with soap and water, a highly functional steam, gas or electric engine, and in some cases a roof or a gaily colored canvas canopy to provide shelter from the elements.</p>
        <p>While 25 boats participated three years ago, this year's date unfortunately coincided with a major launch meet on the Hudson River at Kingston, N.Y. Consequently, there will be fewer launches in Essex tooting their whistles and chugging around in the water off the museum dock at the foot of Main Street.</p>
        <p>Along the broad wood-plank dock and inside the museum, an impressive array of steam engines will be operating and a display of model steamboats from the museum's collection and on loan will be on view. The 19th-century landmarked museum building once served regular steamboat traffic for people traveling from New York City to Hartford. The last trip was made in 1930.</p>
        <p>Refreshments will be available and there will be people scooping crabs from the dock as usual, oblivious of the goings-on in the river.</p>
        <p>Museum admission is $4 for adults, $3 and $2 for older adults and children, respectively. Call (860) 767-8269 for more information.</p>
        <p>'Mystery of Irma Vep'</p>
        <p>Charles Ludlam's ''Mystery of Irma Vep,'' a show for which the word hilarious is inadequate, had them rolling in the aisles Off Broadway. Now it may be seen at the Summer Cabaret at Yale from Wednesday through Aug. 19.</p>
        <p>Two men play all the numerous roles, male, female and monster, slipping in and out of costume, wig, makeup, voice and character with lightning alacrity. The mystery is as dense as can be, sending up a typically overblown British Gothic tale of Irma, Lord Edgar Hillcrest's first wife, who haunts the current Lady Enid Hillcrest and everyone else on the estate.</p>
        <p>But to scan the plot here would only abort the outrageously funny  confusion and operatic posturing to be enjoyed by the audience. Mr. Ludlam founded the Ridiculous Theatrical Company and taught at the Yale School of Drama in the 1970's and 80's.</p>
        <p>Performances are held at the cabaret, 217 Park Street in New Haven, on Wednesday through Sunday at 8:30 p.m., with dinner service at 7 p.m. Tickets are $10 to $16. Call (203) 432-1567 for reservations or more information.</p>
        <p>Treasures and Antiques Sale</p>
        <p>Historic Keeler Tavern Museum in Ridgefield has scheduled its fifth annual Treasures and Antiques Sale on Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and next Sunday from noon to 5 p.m. on the grounds at 132 Main Street.</p>
        <p>This is a hometown-based event featuring antiques, collectibles, furniture and accessories donated or on consignment from the attics and basements of local residents. Desks, tables, art, silver, china, trunks, textiles and sports equipment are a sampling of the merchandise for sale.</p>
        <p>Early buyers on Saturday from 8 to 9 a.m. will be charged $10, but admission afterward is free. Donations are tax deductible and may be left in the Garden House on the grounds after calling (203) 438-5485 to notify the Keeler Preservation Society. Proceeds from sales will be used for educational programs and to help maintain the buildings, which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.</p>
        <p>The tavern was originally a two-room farmhouse built in 1713. Timothy Keeler bought it in 1769 and opened it as a tavern in 1772. Cass Gilbert became the owner in 1907, adding the Garden House, where many concerts, lectures and annual public Christmas lunches are held. The kitchen, dining room, tap room and bedrooms of the tavern have been restored with some of the original furnishings and antiques of the period.</p>
        <p>Call (203) 438-5485 for more information.</p>
        <p>Arts Marathon</p>
        <p>A poetry and painting marathon is to take place today from 2 to 4 p.m. at the P.M.W. Gallery, 530 Roxbury Road, in Stamford. Poets and poetry lovers are invited to come and read their favorite works, including their own, or just sit back and listen.</p>
        <p>Barnaby Ruhe, an artist for whom process is as much an exhibition as exhibiting, will paint expressionistic portraits one after the other from 2 p.m. until dusk.</p>
        <p>Admission to the dual event is free. To reach the site take Exit 3, Den Road, off the Merritt Parkway. Coming from the north take the first three lefts onto Roxbury Road. Coming from the south go right at the end of the exit road to the gallery entrance about 500 yards ahead on the left.</p>
        <p>For more information, call (203) 968-1699.</p>
