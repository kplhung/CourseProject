        <p>IT might have been almost any Saturday night in the last decade: a string of tail lights blazing like coals in the blue dusk; the air resinous with the scent of chaparral where the Foothill Freeway ribbons along the slopes that cradle the city's sprawl; and the voice. Ratcheting out of the car radio, nasal and husky at the same time, the Spanglish cadences straight from the barrios along Whittier Boulevard, the tone falling midway between a hedge clipper and croon.</p>
        <p>''Check it out, check it out. You gotta call if you want me to play this song again.'' A flight of falsetto harmony, as shimmery as the haze veiling downtown's distant skyscrapers, soars above the thump of fuzz-tone bass and fills the car with romantic yearning. ''Doesn't that sound good?'' the hedge clipper inquires solicitously. ''Let me start it again from the top.'' The disc jockey, known simply as Sancho, has admitted to playing the opening bars of a song he likes -- it might be a bilingual ballad by a struggling local group, it might be brassy classic of Latin jazz -- as many as 19 times in succession. ''C'mon,'' he wheedles, cutting off the falsettos in mid-lift. ''I've heard from Azusa, Downey, Garden Grove, Sylmar, City Terrace, Echo Park.''</p>

        <p>IT might have been almost any Saturday night in the last decade: a string of tail lights blazing like coals in the blue dusk; the air resinous with the scent of chaparral where the Foothill Freeway ribbons along the slopes that cradle the city's sprawl; and the voice. Ratcheting out of the car radio, nasal and husky at the same time, the Spanglish cadences straight from the barrios along Whittier Boulevard, the tone falling midway between a hedge clipper and croon.</p>
        <p>''Check it out, check it out. You gotta call if you want me to play this song again.'' A flight of falsetto harmony, as shimmery as the haze veiling downtown's distant skyscrapers, soars above the thump of fuzz-tone bass and fills the car with romantic yearning. ''Doesn't that sound good?'' the hedge clipper inquires solicitously. ''Let me start it again from the top.'' The disc jockey, known simply as Sancho, has admitted to playing the opening bars of a song he likes -- it might be a bilingual ballad by a struggling local group, it might be brassy classic of Latin jazz -- as many as 19 times in succession. ''C'mon,'' he wheedles, cutting off the falsettos in mid-lift. ''I've heard from Azusa, Downey, Garden Grove, Sylmar, City Terrace, Echo Park.''</p>
        <p>The broadcast does not come from the oldies stations, the soundtrack of choice for four decades for cruising down Whittier Boulevard; nor from the Spanish-language stations, the fastest-growing segment of the Los Angeles market, whose featured groups, long-haired rockers like Los Temerarios glower from a billboard above Hollywood and Vine. It comes instead from the public radio station KPCC-FM (89.3) on the manicured campus of Pasadena City College. And the communities named by the disc jockey, known off-air as Daniel A. Castro, a 56-year-old Pasadena native, extend ripple fashion along the length of the Foothill Freeway (Pasadena lies at the midpoint), stretch south toward the coast and into Orange County, span aging downtown neighborhoods and newly minted tracts in the far ends of the San Fernando and San Gabriel valleys.</p>
        <p>The list reflects both the strength of KPCC's signal and the breadth of the audience for ''The Sancho Show.'' But to those familiar with Los Angeles's ethnic geography, the list has a deeper meaning. The suburbs named are compass points of the Chicano Diaspora. Not ''Latino.'' That term embraces those with Central and South American as well as Mexican ancestry. And not ''Hispanic,'' with its colonial disregard of Mexico's Aztec heritage and its inexactness in the face of second- and third-generation Americans whose command of Spanish -- like many Jews' command of Yiddish -- may comprise only a short list of familial endearments, the occasional interjection and a variety of insults. In California, ''Chicano'' is the designation of choice when the speaker wishes to invoke an identity at once Mexican and American, and something else as well: a consciously defended middle ground between tradition and assimilation.</p>
        <p>Radio -- portable, affordable and interactive from the beginning -- has been one of this constituency's favorite forms of self-expression. This despite the fact that on air, as in politics, the community often lacked an official voice. Indeed, Chico Sesma, a Los Angeles jazz musician who (beginning in 1949 and continuing for two decades) broadcast a bilingual mix of traditional boleros and jazz-inflected salsa, was until the 1980's virtually the city's only Mexican-American radio personality. Nonetheless, radio took on the stamp of its listeners, giving rise to identifiably Chicano stations.</p>
        <p>RECENT changes, however, suggest that as an increasing segment of their audience disperses into the suburbs, a middle ground may be harder to stake out between a musical tradition identified with low-rider cars, conspicuous displays of machismo and other elements of barrio style -- including, perhaps most important, poverty -- and the sounds of assimilation, whether the casual interspersions of Spanish accents on teen-oriented hip-hop stations or the Latin-heavy world-beat programs that draw a hip, young, professional audience. To those who equate assimilation with featureless blandness, any shift toward the mainstream can seem like the closing of a frontier. This may be especially true in the West, where radio has a history of unofficial use.</p>
        <p>In the late 1920's the Federal Radio Commission (precursor to the Federal Communications Commission) moved to regulate station wattage and advertising content; shortly thereafter, some businesses leery of regulation set up shop south of the border. Their stations, with huge, 100,000-watt signals, flooded Texas and California with outsiders' voices: the pie-in-the-sky pitch of patent-medicine pushers, the crazed howling of the legendary disc jockey Wolfman Jack, rock 'n' roll itself. Before long, border radio was also transmitting instant messages, in the form of song dedications, from wives in Mexico to husbands working undocumented in the Southwest.</p>
        <p>Even now, dedications -- a feature largely replaced by call-in contests in most parts of the country -- are still so popular in Los Angeles that a newcomer may suspect that her tuner, ''Twilight Zone'' fashion, has begun to pull in 40-year-old signals. These time-honored rituals, in which callers identify themselves by first name and place of residence, provide a public means of acknowledging ties to the old neighborhood even as one moves elsewhere. They also create a kind of ''placita'' of the air, a central place in which young men and women declare their interest in one another under the watchful ears of the community.</p>
        <p>Often they do so with the same songs that their parents used during their courtship. These might include the 1961 heart-throb classic ''Angel Baby'' from San Diego's own Rosie and the Originals; or ''Natural High,'' a 1973 hit by the Missouri-born, London-based soul group Bloodstone. (Its lyrics, backed by a gravity-defying falsetto descant, offer what is perhaps the ultimate in romantic juxtapositions, ''I will love you till the day that I die'' and ''I don't even know you.'')</p>
        <p>David Reyes and Tom Waldman, authors of ''Land of a Thousand Dances: Chicano Rock 'n' Roll From Southern California'' (University of New Mexico, 1998), cite cross-generational listening as one of the hallmarks of a Chicano audience. ''There's not the same sense of rock 'n' roll or rhythm-and-blues being something you listen to as rebellion against your parents,'' Mr. Waldman said in an interview. ''In fact, you pay close attention to what your parents listen to, and you respect that music as your parents respected it, and you see in it what they saw in it.''</p>
        <p>That loyalty extends to radio personalities as well, like Art Laboe, whose in-store broadcasts were memorialized by the Los Angeles poet Luis Alfaro (''just in time to watch Mr. Oldies,/ Art Laboe, introduce/ 'the oldie of the week'/which was always Angel Baby,'') and the unquenchable Dick (Huggy Boy) Hugg. Now 70 and still broadcasting regularly from oldies station KRTH-FM (101), Mr. Hugg likes to refer to himself as ''the Dick Clark of the Chicanos.'' For more than three decades his voice (which sounds like it's projecting through a mouthful of sugar) was the one heard introducing Thee Midniters, East L.A.'s home-grown rhythm-and-blues band; or bantering with female callers between dedications of ''Darling Baby'' to errant boyfriends during his 14 years at KRLA-AM (1110). In what is perhaps a typically West Coast exercise in assimilation and tradition, Mr. Hugg and Mr. Laboe, the city's longest-serving disc jockeys, made careers as white men broadcasting black music to a brown audience.</p>
        <p>More than a means of communication, however, radio in the Los Angeles barrios became an instrument in an ambitious project of cultural assemblage. Listeners used the request and dedication lines to shape a regionally distinctive playlist out of B-sides, album cuts and obscurities. Much of the material had its roots in doo-wop, in part because of proximity -- Los Angeles was a mecca for black recording artists in the 1950's, doo-wop's heyday -- and in part, Mr. Reyes suggests, because the emotion-laden ballads recalled styles popular in Mexico. But what emerged was a locally enshrined aesthetic, ''brown-eyed soul.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Reyes and Mr. Waldman point to its emphasis on smoothness and sincerity -- and, one might add, syncopation. Certainly one can trace a continued fondness for doo-wop's dolorous beat and insistent focus on vocals (so that each tender nuance can be heard in all its breathy glory). But in those sudden bursts of multipart harmony that so often greet a telling line, or in the falsetto voice spiraling giddily above the bridge, an imaginative listener can hear a powerful metaphor. These voices ignore borders. They soar free of pigeonholes and stereotypes, of gang turf and familial obligation, even when their owners might not.</p>
        <p>Aesthetics are independent of income. Chicano radio shaped the area's musical landscape as surely as developers striped its hills, and with a style as evocatively Southern Californian as pink stucco and orange tile. What emerged in the process was a sense that radio was a tool that could be adapted to the community's needs. And yet, at the core of this aesthetic -- however vibrant -- are songs already written and thus, with constant hearing, possibly in danger of wearing thin. The danger has been less, thanks to Sancho's eclectic musical tastes (everything from Chicano country and western to comedy and sometimes memorable hybrids of the two like Lalo Guerrero's ''Mexican Mamas, Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Busboys'').</p>
        <p>No wonder, then, that e-mails from outraged listeners flooded ''The Sancho Show'' Web site when at the end of February, the program, a fixture on KPCC for 16 years, was abruptly canceled without even the traditional farewell broadcast. Many writers, including a number with Anglo-Saxon surnames, testified to Mr. Castro's civic-mindedness, as evidenced by his keeping musical traditions alive, exposing listeners to a wide variety of new styles and artists and especially his raising of money for scholarships and his relentless homilies on the importance of education (''No School No Class'' was a favorite). ''When I first moved to California from West Virginia 11 years ago,'' one man wrote, ''I felt the Chicano culture was alien. After 'The Sancho Show,' I am much more sympathetic. Most important, my children know if they don't get down with the libros, they will have to get down with the burros.'' Others were poignantly personal: ''I work the graveyard shift at Kal Kan Pet Foods. No production, just boring washing down with a hot/cold water hose. I always have my walkman set to 89.3. There will be a tremendous void.''</p>
        <p>The cancellation was not an isolated event, but part of a sweeping reorganization that followed the decision by Pasadena City College trustees, facing a budget deficit at the station, to lease KPCC's license. The lessee, Minnesota Public Radio, through the newly created nonprofit Southern California Public Radio, canceled all of the music programming to institute a 24-hour news and public-affairs format. And while protesters questioned what ''public'' was being served by jettisoning quirky locally produced programs in favor of those produced by National Public Radio and readily available on other area stations, there was a deeper fear.</p>
        <p>This was the second hit Chicano radio had taken in two years. KRLA, the definitive voice of brown-eyed soul for more than three decades, had suffered a similar format change when new owners took over at the end of November 1998. The emotional 14-hour farewell marathon, presided over by Huggy Boy, was accompanied by an Internet betting pool to name the actual swan song, no easy task at a station whose record collection, estimated at 6,000 songs, made it the oldies Library of Congress. If Sancho's distinctive regional voice, with its obvious community-service message, could be stilled as well, perhaps the culture he spoke for was no longer so distinctive nor as much of a community as it had imagined.</p>
        <p>The grass in the small quadrangle in front of the administration building at Los Angeles Mission College is sparse and shin high. The campus, located in Sylmar, where the northern end of the San Fernando Valley meets the mountains, was named by The Los Angeles Times as the community college system's most crowded, although that fact is not much in evidence on a July afternoon. Its 7,000-member student body is 70 percent Latino.</p>
        <p>It is easy to believe Mr. Castro, the college's vice president of academic affairs, when he says he never actually meant to become a disc jockey. Silver haired, dark suited and wearing a tie whose swirling figures resolve themselves after a couple of minutes of contemplation into lutes, he is every inch the dean. He envisioned a radio show as a kind of Trojan horse, smuggling positive messages about the value of education to local youth under the guise of entertainment. And he's the first to admit that his priorities have not always made him popular either with music lovers, who resent his autocratic penchant for interrupting songs, or with callers accustomed to radio as an extension of their neighborhood.</p>
        <p>''Somebody'd call up and say, 'This is so and so from White Fence.' I'd say, 'Where's White Fence at?' '' (White Fence is the name of an East L.A. street gang and the neighborhood it controls.) ''I know where White Fence is, but I'd say: 'I don't want to hear about all that. You live here on his earth, man. You better learn to get along with the person next to you.' ''</p>
        <p>Eventually Mr. Castro gave up taking dedications. There was ''the potential to be kiting messages back and forth into the institutions,'' he explains. ''You going to university, you going to college, you going to barber school, I'll mention your name. I ain't gonna mention your name 'cause you're locked up.'' He ends, like so many born teachers, on a Socratic note. ''What kind of message am I telling that little kid out there?''</p>
        <p>For Ramon Miramontes, a program director at Cal State Northridge who first encountered Mr. Castro as a community college student and who was one of the two dozen supporters of ''The Sancho Show'' who attended Pasadena City College's' board of trustees meeting in July in continued protest, the message was simple. ''He allowed me to keep my language,'' Mr. Miramontes explains.</p>
        <p>KPCC's ''Intelligent Talk'' format is entering its sixth month and the mood of supporters of ''The Sancho Show'' at the trustees meeting is more dogged than hopeful. The show has been replaced by ''Prairie Home Companion.'' As for the possibility of another public station picking up Mr. Castro's program, he only says, ''They haven't come asking.'' There are, however, new voices making themselves heard (although not as yet in Pasadena except via the Internet).</p>
        <p>FROM Friday night rush hour to 7 on Saturday morning, Radio Aztlan controls the airwaves at KUCR-FM (88.3), the voice of the University of California at Riverside, with a series of Chicano-specific grooves: jazz, rap, oldies and ''movimiento,'' or protest music. ''Aztlan'' is the ancient Aztec homeland, believed to lie north of Mexico, in what is now Chicano country. Riverside, 60 miles east of Los Angeles, is the kind of place writers have in mind when they refer to the ''death of the California dream.'' Its orange groves have been overrun with town houses; architectural glories, including a ''Mission Revival'' fruit packing shed, stand mouldering in neglect. That particular dream's death is less frequently mourned by Californians like Roberto Tijerina, 34, KUCR's director of Chicano programs, who grew up the son of Spanish-speaking farm workers and graduated from the university last year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tijerina, who with his student staff coordinated a conference on Chicano alternative radio earlier this year, dreams of an expanding network of stations with similar programs joining those in San Jose, Berkeley, even tiny Blythe on the California-Arizona border. At present, however, he sees Radio Aztlan's influence closer to home, in a local commercial station's decision to institute its own Chicano rap program, with a former member of Lighter Shade of Brown, a Los Angeles group that was one of the founders of Latin hip-hop in the 1980's, as host. There is a cheerfully instructive irony here. Among the sounds Lighter Shade of Brown sampled in its heyday was the voice of Huggy Boy.</p>
        <p>This June, ''border radio'' took on new meaning when the Fresno-based non-profit Radio Bilingue began broadcasting from Tijuana's XHITT-FM (88.7). Founded by the Oaxaca native and Harvard graduate Hugo Morales in 1975 to serve -- and connect -- Spanish-speaking farm workers, it now broadcasts news, call-in programs and music (everything from mariachis to rock en espanol to oldies) to both agricultural and urban Latino communities in the United States, Puerto Rico and northern Mexico.</p>
        <p>The only thing missing, perhaps, in these new developments is the sense of radio as itself a middle ground -- a kind of aural city park, a pleasantly public form of transport -- where for a few decades, at least, a wider-reaching California dream came true, and music-loving listeners black, brown and white, young and old, Spanish- and English-speaking, learned to recognize one another's voices and know themselves as neighbors.</p>
