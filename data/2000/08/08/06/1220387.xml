        <p>The days of girls' wearing their boyfriends' class rings to symbolize going steady may be right up there with curfews and dorm mothers, but the rings themselves are far from out. Lately, students have been shucking traditional designs in favor of those with personal resonance.</p>
        <p>Students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, class of 2002, have added symbols of their own to the Brass Rat, so named because from a distance the carving of a beaver on the brass ring looks like a rat. The traditional image of a blacksmith now clutches a picket sing, commemorating a continuing debate over housing earlier this year, and the carving of a book-wielding bearded scholar has morphed into a female holding a laptop computer. The other side shows M.I.T.'s Great Dome, recalling a 1999 student prank when a group covered the dome in vellum and made it look like the ''Star Wars'' robot R2D2.</p>
        <p>Last year, students and staff at Marquette Univeristy in Milwaukee redesigned the university's previously generic class ring. It now features the Marquette seal; the St. Joan of Arc chapel, one of Milwaukee's oldest buildings; and the Tower of Marquette Hall, which houses a carillon of 48 bells.</p>
        <p>The Virginia Women's Institute of Leadership, a four-year baccalaureate program begun in 1995 at Mary Baldwin College in Staunton, Va., requires additional math, science, leadership studies and military training. Crista Cabe, associate vice president for college relations, said the members of the first class ''wanted a special ring - different from the regular Mary Baldwin College ring - to symbolize the high level of accomplishment demanded of them.'' The class of 2000's ring shows combat boots, a tent (for the wilderness experience), a lyre (for the marching band), two clasping handes (for the connection between academia and military) and curved stairs (freshmen must use straight stairs, not the quad's curvy ones).</p>
        <p>But not everything changes. Texas A&amp;M would not dream of altering the layers of tradition on its ring, especially the shield symbolizing protection of the ''good reputation of the alma mater,'' as the campus newspaper The Texas Aggie explained it in 1969. Porter Garner, class of '79, said, ''We want people to know we are Aggies.''</p>
