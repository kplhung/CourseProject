        <p>IT happened 30 years ago, but it's still one of David T. Link's favorite stories.</p>
        <p>He was a partner at the Chicago law firm Winston &amp; Strawn, and the Greyhound Corporation, his biggest client, had struck a deal to buy a small company. Mr. Link discovered that the target company had undervalued its inventory by nearly $1 million. He persuaded Greyhound, which was at first reluctant, to increase its bid.</p>
        <p>''Too many law schools teach that a lawyer's obligation ends at maximizing the client's profits,'' Mr. Link said. ''I say there's a moral obligation to get justice.''</p>
        <p>Until last year, Mr. Link was content to promulgate that idea at the Notre Dame Law School, where he had been the dean for 24 years. But then, the Rev. Dennis Dease, president of St. Thomas University in Minneapolis, asked him to design and run its new nondenominational faith-based law school, to  open in September 2001. He jumped at it.</p>
        <p>''What a challenge!'' said Mr. Link, who is 63. ''I get to start a new Notre Dame.''</p>
        <p>As Mr. Link sees it, doctors heal the body, ministers heal the soul and lawyers heal society. ''I don't think there is a legal question that doesn't have a moral facet,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Maybe not, but should lawyers act on those moral facets? Definitely not, said Mario Cuomo, the former New York governor who is now a lawyer at Wilkie, Farr &amp; Gallagher. He remembers bridling when an appeals court applied concepts of morality to a breach-of-contract suit.</p>
        <p>''The chief judge wrote, 'The result was unjust; the case is reversed,' '' Mr. Cuomo recalled. ''My reaction was: What standard is he applying? The Koran? The Talmud? How can anyone use the law to make people behave in ways that are not required by the law itself?''</p>
        <p>To Alan M. Dershowitz, the Harvard Law School professor, Mr. Link's concept of lawyer as healer is a pragmatic impossibility. ''Clients will say, 'You are not my priest, you are not my mother; I've decided to make money, and if you won't help me, I'll get another lawyer,' '' he said.</p>
        <p>Nor are all professors at Roman Catholic law schools in tune with Mr. Link. Here is how John Q. Barrett, an associate professor at St. John's University School of Law in Jamaica, Queens, reacted to the Greyhound story: ''It's the seller's lawyer's job to notice that assets were undervalued.''</p>
        <p>Clearly, Mr. Link does not agree. He has asked lawyers whose values he likes to be mentors to St. Thomas's students. The school will help pay off loans for students who go into public service; it will offer joint degrees in law and social work, divinity, education or business, and will staff its law clinic with people from those fields.</p>
        <p>The United States has 183 accredited law schools -- 3 in Minneapolis alone. The total includes 25 Catholic law schools. Still, Father Dease says St. Thomas has received hundreds of letters from would-be students and faculty members.</p>
        <p>''David believes so strongly in faith-based law that he is an apostle,'' Father Dease said.</p>
        <p>David Link grew up in Sandusky, Ohio, the youngest of six children in a strict Catholic home. He often visited his father, a car dealer, at work, and he was struck by how well his father treated customers -- and by the repeat business he got.</p>
        <p>''My mom taught us that ethics were necessary even if they hurt,'' Mr. Link recalled. ''My father showed that ethics could make you successful.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Link majored in advertising and philosophy at Notre Dame in South Bend, Ind. His plan to take over his father's dealership was scrapped when his father sold the business.</p>
        <p>He toyed with becoming a journalist -- after all, he met Barbara, his wife of 42 years and mother of his four children, while working on his high school newspaper -- but instead attended Notre Dame Law School.</p>
        <p>After graduating in 1961, he joined the Internal Revenue Service. He  became friends with the I.R.S. chief counsel, Crane Houser -- ''He liked my J.F.K. imitations,'' Mr. Link recalled -- and eventually followed him to Winston &amp; Strawn. Mr. Link took a leave in 1970 to help Notre Dame Law School set up a program in tax law. He never came back.</p>
        <p>''Technically, I'm in my 31st year of leave,'' said Mr. Link, who became the dean in 1975.</p>
        <p>Mr. Link has helped to set up Catholic law schools in Australia and South Africa. In South Bend, he helped build housing for homeless people, and was a mentor to minority students.</p>
        <p>''A lot of African-Americans balk at going to a Catholic school in the Midwest, but Dean Link helped us recruit,'' said Elton Johnson, a second-year law student at Notre Dame, who is black.</p>
        <p>Even former students who have gone into politics -- a profession not always known for its ethical standards -- say they have been influenced by Mr. Link's willingness to walk the walk.</p>
        <p>Clark Durant, a 1976 Notre Dame law school graduate, consulted with Mr. Link before running unsuccessfully in 1990 for a Michigan seat in the United States Senate. ''I always valued David's counsel, his belief that being a leader goes beyond just teaching law,'' Mr. Durant said.</p>
        <p>Joseph A. Cari Jr., another of Mr. Link's former students, managed Senator Joseph Biden's campaign for the Democratic nomination for president in 1988. When his candidacy was crushed, Mr. Cari's first reaction was to leave politics. ''I kept hearing David's voice, saying 'do constructive things in times of pain,' '' Mr. Cari said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cari is now finance chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Last year, when he was named chairman of the Woodrow Wilson Center for International Scholars in Washington, he invited Mr. Link to the swearing-in ceremony. ''It just wouldn't have felt the same without David,'' he said.</p>
