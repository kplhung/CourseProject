        <p>THE legends and lore of the Bloomsbury Group, especially the messily entangled lives of its members, have outrun its actual achievements. Only Virginia Woolf and John Maynard Keynes are widely known today for their serious work as well. But as ''The Art of Bloomsbury''at the Yale Center for British Art in New Haven makes clear, Bloomsbury artists made art with an enviable thoroughness. In the exhibition, that art is presented with almost equal thoroughness.</p>
        <p>Although Bloomsbury flourished in cosmopolitan London in the early 20th century, the art has the earmarks of provincialism. It's a universal axiom that when an art style is practiced outside the center where it was developed and perfected, its most obvious features tend to be overemphasized. Modern art began and flourished in Paris and the Bloomsbury art picked up on the Fauves' bold use of color and the formal achievements of Cezanne, Picasso and Matisse -- but the new license was often used with an awkward abandon. The large traveling exhibition, organized by the Tate Gallery, gives the Bloomsbury artists a clear shot at making their case. The curator Richard Shone was able to borrow extensively, and he has supplemented the art with cases of ephemera: photographs and letters, so that viewers become well acquainted with the major players.

        <p>THE legends and lore of the Bloomsbury Group, especially the messily entangled lives of its members, have outrun its actual achievements. Only Virginia Woolf and John Maynard Keynes are widely known today for their serious work as well.

In the exhibition, that art is presented with almost equal thoroughness.</p>
        <p>Although Bloomsbury flourished in cosmopolitan London in the early 20th century, the art has the earmarks of provincialism. It's a universal axiom that when an art style is practiced outside the center where it was developed and perfected, its most obvious features tend to be overemphasized. Modern art began and flourished in Paris and the Bloomsbury art picked up on the Fauves' bold use of color and the formal achievements of Cezanne, Picasso and Matisse -- but the new license was often used with an awkward abandon. The large traveling exhibition, organized by the Tate Gallery, gives the Bloomsbury artists a clear shot at making their case. The curator Richard Shone was able to borrow extensively, and he has supplemented the art with cases of ephemera: photographs and letters, so that viewers become well acquainted with the major players. Display cases are devoted to the Hogarth Press as well.</p>
        <p>The press, founded in 1917, published all of Virginia Woolf's novels, the critical writings of Roger Fry as well as small books by writers outside the circle such as T.S. Eliot and Henry Green. The jackets of Hogarth Press books look charmingly hand drawn.</p>
        <p>The two commanding figures among the painters are Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant. They are the most ambitious and energetic, and are clearly enamored of their metier. They were clearly enamored of each other, too, for more than 50 years. Although Vanessa Bell, Virginia Woolf's sister, was married to Clive Bell, an art critic, she had a daughter with Grant, who was publicly known as homosexual. Vanessa Bell seems to have been devoted to both her husband and Grant, and they all frequently lived and traveled together.</p>
        <p>As artists, Bell and Grant are amazingly chameleon-like, zooming in and out of pure or semi-abstraction, frequently touching down in representationalism. But they had enormous energy and it's easy to imagine them goading each other on.</p>
        <p>Portraits of the Bloomsbury fold and their friends, as well as self-portraits, are perhaps the most engaging works in the show, which is not surprising since the group excelled in personality, which also seems to be its lasting achievement. Grant's 1913 portrait of the eccentric and often caricatured hostess, Lady Ottoline Morrell, is distinguished by her exaggeratedly sharp chin and the colorful extended plumage of her hat. Nevertheless, as Mr. Shone comments, it is a remarkably sympathetic portrait.</p>
        <p>A contemporary portrait of Virginia Woolf by Bell startlingly shows the writer with a literally blank face. Mr. Shone credits this to Woolf's impatience with being scrutinized and her mobility of expression. Lytton Strachey is almost devoid of facial features, too, though Bell has painted them in faintly, in pink against yellow complexion. A red beard outlines his face. The portrait was obviously done speedily.</p>
        <p>The painters' enthusiasm spilled over into the decorative arts, through the Omega Workshops that their comrade Roger Fry opened in 1911. Although the results can seem amateurish, viewers can see how these utilitarian creations could truly brighten someone's day.</p>
        <p>Grant painted folding screens and decorated a tabletop with an all-over composition meant to look like a lily pond. Bell and Grant designed fire screens that feature highly abstracted vases of large flowers. Fry, who gained eminence as an art critic, also painted, but his most striking contribution to the show is a set of heavy clay dinnerware. Bell created an unusual folding screen distinguished by tents that serve as stabilizing triangular elements in the design.</p>
        <p>It is hard to conceive of the Bloomsbury group in the great outdoors, but many of them made a camping trip in 1913. Bell's related painting ''Summer Camp'' features people sitting before the tents looking very urbane.</p>
        <p>World War I evidently took a lot of steam out of the Bloomsbury way of art and life. Paintings made after the war and into the 1930's have a kind of gravity in them that borders on the academic. The most sympathetic picture in the show is a self-portrait by Bell done as late as 1958 (she died in 1961). She is appropriately world weary under a big-brimmed straw hat. Grant made a lot of self-portraits wearing a similar hat in his old age. (He died in 1978 at 93.) The exhibition goes somewhat full circle. It opens with a 1909-10 self-portrait in which Grant wears a turban.</p>
        <p>Bloomsbury art fills two floors of the center, but one floor includes British artists who were contemporaries of Bell, Grant and the others. Having to contend with Bloomsbury's panache, most of them are destined to be also-rans.</p>
        <p>''The Art of Bloomsbury'' is at the Yale Center for British Art in New Haven through Sept. 3.</p>
