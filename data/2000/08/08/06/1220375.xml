        <p>It's a baseball watch. But the Game Time Schedule Watch does more than show the time and the insignia of your favorite baseball team. It also shows who the Yanks, Mets -- or even the Chicago Cubs, if you prefer -- are playing that day.

        <p>THE baseball fan who has everything doesn't have this.</p>
        <p>It's a baseball watch. But the Game Time Schedule Watch does more than show the time and the insignia of your favorite baseball team. It also shows who the Yanks, Mets -- or even the Chicago Cubs, if you prefer -- are playing that day. And each day at the game's starting hour, it alerts its wearer by playing a rendition of ''Take Me Out to the Ball Game.''</p>
        <p>A Yankee fan puts it on, say, on the morning of Saturday, Aug. 5, and can see that his World Champions are playing Seattle at Yankee Stadium at 4:05 p.m. With a push of a button, the team's season schedule comes on the face.</p>
        <p>The watch, preprogrammed to a time zone and 10 years in the making, is the brainchild of two brothers from Hastings-on-Hudson who now live in Tarrytown: Adam and Carter Pennington.</p>
        <p>The idea, said Adam Pennington, grew out of a baseball fan's frustrations.</p>
        <p>''I'm a big Mets fan,'' he said, ''and my brother and I were in New York one afternoon over a decade ago when someone listening to the game on radio said David Cone was pitching a no-hitter for the Mets. I didn't even know the Mets were playing an afternoon game that day. 'With my luck,' I said, 'I'll miss the first no-hitter in Mets history!' ''</p>
        <p>By the time Cone actually pitched a no-hitter 10 years later with the Yankees, the schedule watch was well on its way to production. ''I gave the first one to my 13-year-old son, Julian,'' Adam Pennington said. ''He loved that it went off at 5 a.m. when the Mets opened the season in Japan.''</p>
        <p>The watch is priced at $49.95, with seasonal replacement schedules available at $14.95.</p>
        <p>It can be ordered by calling (888) 249-9627 or by clicking on the company's Web site, www.schedulewatch.com. Nascar watches are available for auto racing fans, and the brothers are developing watches for all major sports.</p>
