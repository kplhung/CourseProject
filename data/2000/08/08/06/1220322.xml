        <p>AT a recent dance forum, Elizabeth Streb introduced herself with considered clarity: ''Ten years ago I thought of myself as someone who had a dance company. Today I think of myself as someone who creates wild actions and movement moments in a show that I sell.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Streb, artistic director of Streb, has never been a typical choreographer. More like a daredevil, she gained recognition in the mid-1980's for her gravity-baiting feats of physicality using trampolines, gyroscopic belts and bungee cords. But like a true postmodernist, she hated music (''too bossy'') and rejected narrative. Her focus was on the abstract properties of pure movement -- time, space and the body.</p>

        <p>AT a recent dance forum, Elizabeth Streb introduced herself with considered clarity: ''Ten years ago I thought of myself as someone who had a dance company. Today I think of myself as someone who creates wild actions and movement moments in a show that I sell.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Streb, artistic director of Streb, has never been a typical choreographer. More like a daredevil, she gained recognition in the mid-1980's for her gravity-baiting feats of physicality using trampolines, gyroscopic belts and bungee cords. But like a true postmodernist, she hated music (''too bossy'') and rejected narrative. Her focus was on the abstract properties of pure movement -- time, space and the body.</p>
        <p>For her new show, ''Action Heroes,'' parts of which will be performed on Friday and Saturday at Vanderbilt Hall in Grand Central Terminal, Ms. Streb has pumped up the spectacle with a music-sound score and at least the semblance of a story. During the 70-minute show, the eight performers career through more than a dozen episodes, including crashing though a pane of glass and bouncing off walls. Ms. Streb has gone Vegas. Or, at least, that's where she's headed.</p>
        <p>''Action Heroes'' embeds new and familiar stunts into a music-video-style format that pays homage to Ms. Streb's early inspirations, like Evel Knievel, the motorcycle showman, Cannonball Richards (he caught them in his gut) and Annie Edson Taylor, the first person to survive Niagara Falls in a barrel.</p>
        <p>With ''Action Heroes,'' Ms. Streb leaves the dance world behind, at least in economic terms. Her technical ambitions for its ultimate development will be too costly for dance venues, so she is turning to public spaces, commercial ventures and an earned-income business model.</p>
        <p>The company's self-contained metal performance structure, a box truss nearly 20 feet tall, is considered an exemplar of market-driven strategies for nonprofit arts institutions by the Joyce Mertz-Gilmore Foundation, which financed the portable stage in 1998. The performance space -- complete with its own lighting, moving walls, video screens and sound -- lets the company set up cost effectively in any context. No longer limited to large, traditional theaters, Streb productions can be marketed to broader audiences and potentially yield more earned income.</p>
        <p>The line between performance and entertainment has blurred considerably in the last few years. Riverdance, Matthew Bourne's ''Swan Lake'' and most notably the teaming of the experimentalist Julie Taymor with Disney to produce Broadway's ''Lion King'' have forged significant links between art and commerce.</p>
        <p>Ms. Streb, herself a hybrid of working class roots and MacArthur Foundation ''genius grant'' credentials, cites Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey, Cirque du Soleil, Stomp, ''Bring In da Noise, Bring In da Funk'' and Zingaro as precedents. The franchise scheme used by Blue Man Group, the sly East Village trio that has organized outposts in three other cities, she says, ''is radical and very inspiring to everyone.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Streb was one of a number of downtown performance artists who approached the Blue Man operation in the early 1990's, after it had managed to break through to the mainstream media. Manuel Igrejas, the press representative for Blue Man and now for Streb, had learned that the public was ready for exciting new work. ''It was starved,'' he recalls, ''for entertainment that moved it on a fundamental level.</p>
        <p>''I think a lot of artists want to move out of the not-for-profit zone. I think there is a funding ceiling that can keep artists at a certain level. It takes a lot of courage to turn down the beneficence -- which is arduously sought -- of a kindly Uncle Funder. Blue Man Group has created the template for artists to be self-sufficient and self-producing, to make work the way they want to and make a profit.''</p>
        <p>Carol Derfner, president of C. W. Shaver &amp; Company, Inc., a consulting firm for nonprofit organizations, agrees. She advises her clients, including the Paul Taylor Dance Company, to ''start thinking their way out of the scarcity model of economics that the not-for-profit management system is based upon.''</p>
        <p>''Entrepreneurial artists and cultural executives are figuring out that they produce something with real value in the marketplace and are taking more control over their destinies,'' she says.</p>
        <p>Before Grand Central, Ms. Streb was seen on MTV, at Coney Island and under the Brooklyn Bridge. The company performed during a baseball game at the Metrodome in Minneapolis. Now, she wants to follow Blue Man, Cirque du Soleil and the new vaudevillians Penn and Teller to what Mr. Igrejas calls the ''new frontier in entertainment'': Las Vegas.</p>
        <p>''It's my next dream,'' says Ms. Streb, who is 50 and retired from performance. Las Vegas offers her an appealing scale: more people, more space, more equipment. ''I am very interested in what I would make if money were not an issue,'' she says. ''Well, what artist wouldn't? So right now it's 'Las Vegas or Bust.' ''</p>
        <p>She now conceives of her art as a series of events in public places, not as a repertory dance company. And public space, she adds, is not tame territory. During the monthlong residency at Grand Central Terminal, people wandering or hustling through the hall gave her instant and uncensored feedback. They told her if they didn't get it, didn't like it or couldn't believe she got paid for doing it. The terror of receiving such uninhibited (and instructive) commentary from complete strangers enthralls her.</p>
        <p>''I wonder if it's how we look, the unitards and all?'' she says. ''I try to analyze all of the private symbols and secrets we employ -- choices we made way back when. They are so automatic that we don't notice them any longer.''</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, her artistic goal remains the same: to take her audiences on a ride, inducing their own physical experiences and spatial confusion. To ''amaze, even shock, worry and surprise'' them, she says. But not to alienate them. So for ''Action Heroes'' she has integrated video projections and music as narrative devices to remind the audience that the performers are real people, not cartoon characters.</p>
        <p>P EOPLE like music and need to be told a story,'' Ms. Streb says. ''Me, too. It's a welcome relief from having to experience real work. It's the sherbet moment that cleanses the palate. So I am using music and story to mitigate the brutality of what we do and its eventual numbing effect on audiences.''</p>
        <p>The ostensible story -- more associative than narrative -- is Ms. Streb's own story. ''This is the action whence I hail,'' she says. ''The action heroes I emulated as a kid growing up. It was at the circus that I actually witnessed transgressive, outlawed and untidy action in America.''</p>
        <p>Nick Fortunato's ''video rodeo'' brings Evel Knievel, pole sitters, monster trucks, Harry Houdini and bull riders right into the ring. Using a layered mix of live cameras, pure geometric forms and prerecorded images like old newsreel footage or cloud formations, Mr. Fortunato, a video, installation and performance artist, evokes the spirit of action heroes past and present.</p>
        <p>The projections sometimes function as moving scenery, as when drifting clouds give the swan-diving dancers an expansive sense of flight. The images are sometimes referential, as in ''Squirm,'' a Houdini tribute, which features a clip of the escape artist wriggling out of a straitjacket. ''All the while I am controlling his movements live, in time and to the music,'' Mr. Fortunato says. ''The result is something like Houdini break-dancing.''</p>
        <p>The music similarly ranges from the abstract to the emblematic, including the company's aural trademark: the amplified sounds of the performers' bodies colliding with floor and wall.</p>
        <p>Ms. Streb's free fall into music comes with an immediate caveat. ''I am not actually interested in music,'' she says. ''Music is the true enemy of dance.''</p>
        <p>The composer and sound designer, Miles Green, explains: ''Often music is used to provide propulsion to dance. Elizabeth's movement has so much thrust that the music has to be carefully constructed to not get in the way. The score is more about mood than drive.'' He has created a palette of organic and human sounds, taking his cue from the pioneering daredevils themselves, who ''dealt with really basic elements: water, air, wood, breath and bone.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Green also uses popular songs to suggest the genealogy of Ms. Streb's action vocabulary. A vintage 1920's recording of ''Happy Days Are Here Again,'' for example, leads into the pole-balancing sequence, but then the mood darkens, with composed music that conveys the drama of the danger-seeking desperados.</p>
        <p>By placing the performers in historical context, Ms. Streb hopes to defuse any questions that might distract her spectators. ''If someone asks, 'But why do you dive through the glass?' I have failed. If the event I construct does not take over the physicality of the person watching, then it is not an integral enough moment. Well, perhaps now it will be clear why we do it. We are transgressive action maniacs and have no other choice but to do the move right now this second.''</p>
