        <p>For Kendall Gill, the cost of placing winning above money and security above doubt was nearly $5 million. After 10 seasons in the National Basketball Association and nearly a decade's worth of wise financial investing, the veteran swingman was willing to pay that steep price.</p>
        <p>So Gill turned down a one-year offer of $7 million from the Nets on Friday and told them he would join the defending champion Los Angeles Lakers, who will most likely be able to pay him $2.25 million next season.</p>
        <p>Speaking by telephone last night from his parents' home in suburban Chicago, Gill said he would sign with the Lakers tomorrow. He hopes the Nets can pull off a sign-and-trade deal that would enable him to make more than $2.25 million, but if they cannot, he said he would not hesitate to take less money.</p>
        <p>''I've been smart financially, so I'm not in a position where I have to take that,'' Gill said of the Nets' $7 million offer. ''I'm real excited about playing for the Lakers, about being in the purple and gold, about having the chance to win 70 games, about playing with two of the best players in the league, playing in the best system in the league and playing for the best coach in the league.''</p>
        <p>Besides the opportunity to win a title, play with Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant and for Coach Phil Jackson, another factor in Gill's decision was his view that the Nets did not respect him during the free-agency period. He did not like their decision to pursue Ron Mercer and other shooting guards before making him an offer, and he thought he probably would have been traded if he had accepted the Nets' offer. ''What it came down to is that a championship team wanted me and a team that will be fighting to make the playoffs this year really wasn't sure if it wanted me a week ago,'' Gill, who expects to start, said.</p>
        <p>Rod Thorn, the Nets' president, said last night that he had spent ''nearly eight hours'' on the telephone Friday trying to work out a sign-and-trade deal, but so far nothing had materialized. The Nets are not interested in any of the players the Lakers have offered, so a third team will have to be involved for such a deal to take place.</p>
        <p>The Nets have great interest in guard Doug Christie and center Michael Stewart of Toronto, but it will be difficult to swing a three-team deal. With Gill heading west, the Nets have only one shooting guard on their active roster: the career backup Lucious Harris. Most starting-caliber free-agent shooting guards have signed with other teams; and the Nets have only $1.2 million to spend.</p>
