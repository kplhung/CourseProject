        <p>DINERS who develop an advanced case of the blahs from organic and natural food, who flee from vegetable-dominated dishes and shun any preparation labeled healthful will find Planet Bliss on Shelter Island to be a revelation.

        <p>DINERS who develop an advanced case of the blahs from organic and natural food, who flee from vegetable-dominated dishes and shun any preparation labeled healthful will find Planet Bliss on Shelter Island to be a revelation. This cute, cozy restaurant and natural-food market, at 23 North Ferry Road (631-749-0053), offers a rare combination: food that tastes good and is good for you as well.</p>
        <p>Sebastian Bliss, who was the sous chef at the Rams Head Inn on Shelter Harbor, and his partner, Julie O'Neill, from the fashion industry, have moved into the house where the Cogan Family Restaurant and before that the Bohack Market had been and turned it into a bright, cheery spot that oozes low-key charm.</p>
        <p>Laidback locals, and especially tourists, seem to be gravitating to this place of candles and cool jazz, orange-yellow walls, sky-blue ceilings, glossy varnished hardwood floors, overhead fans, bare tables, Tiffany lamp lighting and a tiny bar.  Outside, the 10 well-spaced porch and garden tables offer the kind of tranquil, green milieu that expensive restaurants along Nassau and western Suffolk's busy major arteries can not duplicate, even in more elaborate venues (it's the anti-Jericho Turnpike).</p>
        <p>At lunch, patrons munch on salads (baby spinach, mesclun, daikon, carrot and ginger slaw) and sandwiches (smoked turkey and Swiss cheese, beef or tuna burgers, pastrami or tempeh Rubens, hummus and vegetables on pita) and wash everything down with smoothies and mixed juices. Strawberry banana and blueberry melon are among the former and grapefruit apple and pear lemon ginger among the latter.</p>
        <p>But Planet Bliss is building its growing reputation mostly as a result of the taste wallop that springs from its dinner fare. Its salads taste as though they were assembled after a raid on the backyard gardens of Provence. The baby spinach, mesclun and hijiki are especially excellent. An absolutely glorious creamy seafood chowder special ($5.50), with equal parts of corn, crab, shrimp and salmon, was rich, full bodied and not to be missed, and an unconventional bruschetta ($8) crowned with goat cheese, crushed olives, roasted red peppers and basil instead of tomatoes and onions turned heads and set tongues wagging and salivating.</p>
        <p>Medium-rare, rum-glazed salmon ($18), perched on a moist mountain of couscous and escorted by sweet, ripe tropical fruits, proved to be a subtle, rewarding blend. Half of a juicy, free-range chicken ($15.50), marinated in rosemary, thyme and lemon, tasted like chicken used to before factory farms. A comforting pristine special of seared local stripped bass ($18), with leeks, tomatoes and herbs on a bed of terrific whipped potatoes, is also a winner.</p>
        <p>Even dishes that are usually bland and boring yielded full-bore flavors.</p>
        <p>The coarse turkey sausage nuggets, mixed into a tomato-basil linguine ($14.50), were earthy and satisfying. Two vegetarian choices showed that it's not necessary to get on the red-meat-lamb-bandwagon in order to eat food with some kick to it. The stewy amalgam of thyme-touched watercress, cherry tomatoes, olives and artichoke hearts over penne ($14) was far tastier than most such combinations, and the vegetable plate of the day ($14), ratatouille over basmati rice topped by a portobello mushroom cap, was a nostalgic paean to the days when peppy Spanish rice was the rage.</p>
        <p>Even a usually austere vegeterian dish like a bowl of vegan chili ($4) brims over with an admirably lively spicyness.</p>
        <p>Among the entrees, only a tough too-quickly grilled pork chop ($16) disappointed, while a starter of three tiny shrimp with an Asian dipping sauce, which cost $8, was skimpy.</p>
        <p>A homemade dessert that deserves special mention is the solid, dense, delicious whipped cream-covered chocolate mousse. A citrusy lemon cheesecake, strawberry-rhubarb pie and apple crumb pie (the last two from the East Hampton Gourmet bakery) all passed muster.  But an ordinary bread pudding arrived not warm, but microwave hot.  (Sweets are in the $4 to $5 category.)  Special mention too, should be made of the two or three varieties of hearty breads from the acclaimed Sullivan Street Bakery in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>At meal's end, settle down in this mellow venue and sip a cranberry spritzer, natural root beer, $5 glass of wine or blackberry tea, and if it's a bit chilly, don't be surprised if Ms. O'Neill offers you a sweatshirt, the one that she wore the night before. Planet Bliss is that kind of place.</p>
        <p>Openings</p>
        <p>Last month a 40-seat, white-tablecloth restaurant replaced Sam's Bar and Restaurant in Greenlawn. The new restaurant, 252 Broadway (631-262-7200), is an Italian-Continental spot with traditional entrees in the $9.95 (fusilli pomodoro) to $18.95 (grilled yellowfin tuna) range. Adam Pitre, who previously worked at J. DeCarlo's in Huntington, is the chef and Jeff Elliott, a contractor, is the owner of 252 Broadway.</p>
        <p>Apretador II, a 50-seat Salvadoran restaurant, opened at 767 New York Avenue in Huntington (631-421-9729) on June 16. Owned by Juan Gonzalez, who runs Apretrador in Brentwood, the new place, where the Colonial Diner was for years, serves everything from burgers ($4.95) to lobster stuffed with crab and shrimp ($17.95).</p>
        <p>Pancho Villa's, a Mexican restaurant, opened a month and a half ago at 107 East Jericho Turnpike in Huntington Station (631-673-6580). The 72-seat spot, where Musashino Japanese restaurant was, serves dinner entrees in the $7.50 to $19.95 bracket. It is not connected to the restaurant of the same name in Huntington Village.</p>
