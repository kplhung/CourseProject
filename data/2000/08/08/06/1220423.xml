        <p>AARON COPLAND, whose music is often said to be quintessentially American, had a connection with the Yale School of Music in the 70's and early 80's.</p>
        <p>Joan Panetti, director of the Norfolk Chamber Music Festival and Yale Summer School of Music, was a Yale professor at the time and remembers the composer's sitting in on master classes and conducting the Yale School of Music orchestra in a concert of his works. Years before that encounter, when she was still a student, Ms. Panetti was among the composers to be selected to hone their craft at Tanglewood, the summer music festival and institute in Lenox, Mass., and Copland was one of those masters with whom she studied composition.</p>
        <p>But Aaron Copland, whose 100th birthday would be Nov. 14, 2000, also went to Yale because he was interested in the Charles Ives collection at the Yale Music Library and wanted to have a look at the manuscripts. At that time he met Vivian Perlis, director of the Oral History Project in American Music and someone who had conducted many interviews with people who had known or worked with Ives.</p>
        <p>Ms. Perlis developed a rapport with Copland, interviewing him and amassing reams of material, and he asked her to help him with his autobiography. The two-volume work was published by St. Martin's Press in 1984 and 1989 (a new edition is available in conjunction with the Copland birthday centennial).</p>
        <p>On Friday evening in Norfolk, Ms. Panetti and other Yale School of Music faculty and fellows of the Yale Summer School of Music will mark Copland's birthday with a concert of his most American music. The program includes ''Appalachian Spring,'' ''Billy the Kid,'' ''Hoe Down,'' ''Ukelele Serenade'' and ''Old American Songs,'' the last of which will feature the baritone Richard Lalli.</p>
        <p>Ms. Panetti noted that there were not many places celebrating Copland with chamber music performances. ''I'm celebrating his music because I love it,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Michael Boriskin, the pianist and artistic director of the Copland Heritage Association, said: ''Part of the problem with Copland is that he's been part of the American landscape for so long and a treasured icon that he's a little bit taken for granted. A lot of people simply don't know what an important figure he was in the growth of a recognizable American musical idiom.''</p>
        <p>The Norfolk Chamber Music Festival concert begins with a rarely heard version of ''Appalachian Spring.'' Among the 13 required musicians for this original version will be the members of the Vermeer String Quartet as well as the Yale faculty member Frank Morelli on bassoon. ''This is a very intimate, touching version that was a ballet,'' Ms. Panetti said in a telephone conversation between rehearsals in Norfolk. She will be performing at the piano in the concert.</p>
        <p>From her basement nerve center in an aging music building at Yale, Ms. Perlis spoke by phone about the program as well. ''The chamber version was the original,'' she said. ''The one everybody has been used to hearing was the full orchestra suite. The original was not published. Mr. Copland had to be convinced later in life to publish the original. Many feel it has a clarity and authenticity, the way it was done for the Martha Graham ballet.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Perlis added that the reason the composer wrote the piece for 13 instruments was that it was the number of people who could fit into the intended performance space.</p>
        <p>''Billy the Kid'' will be given in a transcription made by Copland himself. A transcription of ''Hoe Down'' for two pianos will be performed by two Yale fellows. Ms. Panetti described this version as being ''so much fun.''</p>
        <p>''Ukelele Serenade'' has no uke in sight and never did. Written for dazzling virtuosic piano and violin, Ms. Panetti said: ''I turn into the ukelele player. For all of its three minutes, it's as hard as any Beethoven sonata I've encountered. It's got to be played in a way that doesn't seem like it.''</p>
        <p>The concert will conclude with a selection of ''Old American Songs,'' which, Ms. Panetti said, really touch one's heart. ''They go from being funny and playful to something dignified and gorgeous such as 'Simple Gifts,' '' she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Perlis, who attended many events with Mr. Copland over the years, remembered him fondly. ''He was so easy to be with,'' she said, ''it was just part of my life. It's nice when a genius is a nice fellow.''</p>
        <p>The Norfolk Chamber Music Festival will present the Aaron Copland Centennial on Friday at 8 p.m. Tickets are $12 to $30, $5 for adults 18-25.
