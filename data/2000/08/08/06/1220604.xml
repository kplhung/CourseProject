        <p>POLITICAL slogans tend to long outlive their authors in this part of the world and none is more enduring, or more musty with age, than the 1950's-vintage catch phrase ''Arab unity.''</p>
        <p>Ten years have passed since all 22 leaders of Arab League countries last gathered for a summit meeting, which was held here, in the aftermath of Iraq's surprise invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, 1990. It was not a pretty sight, marred by food fights between angry Kuwaiti sheiks and bellicose Iraqi officials, and by recriminations and vacillation all around.</p>
        <p>Now, at the urging of the Palestinians, a few Arab leaders like Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak and Jordan's King Abdullah have renewed the perennial call for a new summit meeting, this time billed as an emergency meeting for Arabs to regroup after the failure at Camp David and to counter the spin from Washington that the breakdown was due solely to Arab recalcitrance. Chances for a summit meeting and a new Arab consensus are slim, Arab officials now say. Still, the chimera of a united Arab front continues to shimmer on the horizon -- and, suddenly, not just for the Arabs.</p>
        <p>The United States has long found the Arabs' fractiousness useful in promoting bilateral peace talks and maintaining sanctions on Iraq. But now Edward Walker, the American assistant secretary of state, has been sent  on a tour of Arab states that maintain relations with the United States; he is asking leaders to persuade Mr. Arafat to accept Israeli and American proposals for a final peace.</p>
        <p>The centerpiece of those proposals is an offer of shared administration of Arab East Jerusalem, but not of sovereignty over it. So far, the public reaction to Mr. Walker's trip has been resentment that the United States seems to be calling in its chits in the Arab world.</p>
        <p>''True, the Arab state of affairs is sufficiently dismal to foreclose a decisive pan-Arab stand on Jerusalem and the need to restore Arab sovereignty over its eastern sector,'' wrote Joseph Samaha, a Lebanese analyst for the international Arabic daily newspaper Al Hayat. ''But it's not that bad that the Arabs will concede the loss of the city to Israel forever.''</p>
        <p>If a less fragmented Arab leadership would be helpful to Washington and Israel for the first time in a decade -- and helpful to Arabs who are nostalgic for the days when, collectively, they counted for more -- it is also much harder to nail down now.</p>
        <p>First, the internal political and economic situation in the Arab world is more fragile than it was a decade ago, when Washington could stitch together an anti-Iraq alliance that included most Arab nations and then proceed to establish its own primacy in the region, where many countries are beggars for money and arms.</p>
        <p>Long-serving military figures who once could simply impose their will on their people, like King Hussein of Jordan and Hafez al-Assad of Syria, are gone. The nations they left behind for their sons and successors suffer under sick economies with raging unemployment.  Moreover, their heirs are still consolidating power, making them more sensitive to hints of internal discontent and to the threat, real or not, of minority extremists who criticize anything that seems to be catering to Israel or the West.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the new cast of characters in Arab politics is theoretically more free of the constraints of history than the old.</p>
        <p>King Hussein and President Assad, along with the assassinated Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, were warriors of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Mr. Rabin carried an aura of victory, as the former commander in the 1967 war, in which Jordan and Syria lost big chunks of territory to Israel. But their 1967 defeats, and their failure to regain either the West Bank or the Golan Heights through war or diplomacy, weighed heavily on the shoulders of the two Arab leaders.</p>
        <p>THE history of the Syrian and Jordanian leaders also contributed mightily to the lack of Arab unity. No friends of each other, both also had hostile relations with Mr. Arafat, as did the late King Hassan of Morocco, another leader who has bequeathed a regime to his son.</p>
        <p>While their absence from the scene could be considered helpful to peacemaking and Arab unity, the legacy they left of failing economies and ideologically rigid governments may sabotage those goals for their heirs.</p>
        <p>''The baggage of history on their sons is just as great,'' said Kamel Abu Jaber, a former Jordanian foreign minister who is now president of the Jordanian Institute for Diplomacy. ''That's the historical danger of Camp David. It may revive in these young leaders, who may be willing to compromise, a tendency to refreeze into rigid attitudes.''</p>
        <p>More than ever, the Arab world is also running at different speeds.</p>
        <p>Islamic fundamentalist movements, while brutally suppressed in places like Egypt and Syria, are still alive and well elsewhere. The ruling family of Saudi Arabia feels under constant threat from extremists inside and outside the country who criticize it for the continued presence of American troops on its soil. Fundamentalist groups opposed to the Saudi policy of cool cooperation with the West send out streams of e-mails each day accusing the royals of corruption and decadence.</p>
        <p>In Kuwait, a new alliance of Islamists and nationalists has warned the government against making contacts with Israel or Israelis. So while people in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and Egypt may yearn for the presumed economic benefits of a comprehensive peace, the domestic message to the rulers in the Gulf is far different. ''Nobody here cares about the supposed economic benefits,'' said Ahmed al-Baghdadi, a professor of political science at Kuwait University. ''In contrast, the religious movement in the National Assembly is very strong.''</p>
        <p>SO the Old City, a tiny island that contains sites holy to Islam, Christianity and Judaism, may be the one topic that can unite the Arab world.</p>
        <p>''The place where Jesus Christ was resurrected, where Omar built his mosque, where the Prophet Mohammed ascended to heaven -- that's not big stuff?'' commented Abdel Moneim Said, director of the Al Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies. ''It's in the Koran. It's in the prayers.''</p>
        <p>A number of Arab analysts warn that those concerned with the Middle East should be careful of what they wish for. Unity in the Middle East has historically been reactive: a collective ''no.'' The Arab League was created in 1949 to organize opposition to the state of Israel. The Organization of the Islamic Conference, a broader group, was created in 1969 to focus Muslim anger at an attempt by a Christian extremist in Jerusalem to burn down Al Aksa mosque.</p>
        <p>In the end, if a final peace settlement is the goal, the region may be better served by disunity, with each nation following its own interests and path.</p>
        <p>''If there is a final settlement, then here in Jordan at least we hopefully can start talking about a country that is concerned about something other than the Palestinian question,'' said Adnan Abu Odeh, a former adviser to Jordan's King Hussein. ''These days, unfortunately, the region is clouded with illusions.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 10, 2000, Sunday  An article on Aug. 6 about efforts to achieve Arab unity misstated the date and purpose of the formation of the Arab League. A letter dated Sept. 1 from its Washington representative points out that the treaty establishing the league was signed on March 22, 1945; the date was not 1949 and the purpose was not to organize opposition to the state of Israel, which had not yet been founded. The treaty spoke only of strengthening relations among members in financial, communications, cultural, health, social, nationality and social areas.</p>
