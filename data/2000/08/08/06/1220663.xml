        <p>For WLTV, the Univision station in Miami, covering the Republicans in Philadelphia was like getting a seat at a national banquet.

        <p>For WLTV, the Univision station in Miami, covering the Republicans in Philadelphia was like getting a seat at a national banquet. Each day, the outlet was given the access it needed to tailor its Spanish-language newscast via interviews with, among others, Al Cardenas, the chairman of the Florida delegation, and Representative Lincoln Diaz-Balart, a Republican from Miami-Dade County.</p>
        <p>''At 11 p.m., there was a highlight and later we localized the issues and went live with a local delegate,'' said Bernadette Pardo, the station's senior political correspondent. ''The coverage ended up much more productive because there was a larger local emphasis.''</p>
        <p>On the airwaves in Atlanta, prominent Republicans like Colin L. Powell, Dick Cheney, Elizabeth Dole and Newt Gingrich were not mere fixtures on network news programs, but also appeared in profile pieces and sat for interviews with local anchors and reporters. On Chicago's top-rated WLS, Bush family members spoke with Linda Yu, an anchor.</p>
        <p>And in Boston, the final night of WCVB's coverage from Philadelphia featured one of its reporter-anchors, Natalie Jacobson, proclaiming in a way that put a familiar local face on convention-floor exuberance: ''What a night for George W. Bush! What a convention!''</p>
        <p>The major networks may have complained loudly about a dearth of breaking news and even cut back their coverage this year of the four days and nights in the First Union Center. But no such griping was heard from the local electronic news media, whose broadcasting needs convention officials tried to satisfy to a degree unmatched by previous party gatherings.</p>
        <p>Using a battalion of bookers, the Republicans put 200 Bush surrogates at the disposal of radio stations, Web sites and especially local television outlets. They provided free satellite time to stations that did not book their own, and concentrated heavily on contacting outlets in markets in crucial states like Florida, Ohio, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Michigan, with offers to put Republican talking heads on their news programs.</p>
        <p>''It ranged from congressmen to Condoleezza Rice,'' Nels Olson, the convention's master scheduler, said, referring to Mr. Bush's top foreign policy adviser. ''She was going on local shows, even the Internet. The idea was to get as many people out there as we could talking about George Bush. This is my third convention in this job and in terms of sheer volume, this is two or three times the volume we did last time.''</p>
        <p>In the absence of real news, or even real debate, what dominated American news pages and airwaves last week was the sound of one party clapping. How that played depended greatly on how much each of the 1,600 news organizations at the convention, and myriad others that watched from afar, was willing to go beyond the happy talk and examine the nature of Mr. Bush's appeal and the issues that defined his campaign.</p>
        <p>And for the Republicans, the public-relations bonanza -- and the bounce in Mr. Bush's own ratings -- was the payoff for the intensive message discipline imposed on the proceedings.</p>
        <p>Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, said she was impressed by the meticulousness with which the Republicans were collectively putting on one face for the news media. On a stroll on the convention floor before a session, she came upon a copy of the ''message points'' for talking to the media that convention organizers had placed on every delegate's seat.</p>
        <p>The document was nine pages. ''I haven't seen anything this detailed,'' she said. ''It's nicely structured to brief an activist to make a case. Usually it's a two-page 'message profile' with sound bites in it.''</p>
        <p>The lesson? ''The Republicans know what their message is,'' she continued. ''They are able to outline it and outline the line of defense, given the likely Democratic response.''</p>
        <p>An upbeat message seemed to be delivered uniformly from one end of the country to the other, from the pages of The Honolulu Advertiser (''State G.O.P. leaders say Bush will do well in Isles,'' said a Friday headline) to The Portland Press Herald (''Mainers Uplifted by Bush Message''). Mr. Bush's acceptance speech was not only the most prominently reported event of the week but also the most favorably received. Commentators as diverse as Jacob Weisberg of the Webzine Slate, Margaret Carlson of Time magazine and the conservative columnist Robert Novak all gave it admiring notices.</p>
        <p>The address, by Mr. Bush's chief speechwriter, Michael Gerson, was loaded with quotable lines, and the media turned some into overnight classics. Among the most often cited, a reference to President Clinton, ''So much promise, to no great purpose,'' and a dig at Vice President Al Gore, ''I am not running in borrowed clothes.''</p>
        <p>In Houston, the largest city in the governor's home state, coverage of the convention was voluminous, particularly by the strictures of local television news.</p>
        <p>''I've been covering conventions a lot of years, and I never remember one where so many local people were playing a role,'' observed Nancy Shafran, news director of KPRC, an NBC affiliate that sent six staff members to Philadelphia. The convention led the newscast every night, and on Thursday, the program was expanded. ''There was so much to cover it couldn't fit in the typical 35-minute  show,'' Ms. Shafran said.</p>
        <p>New York City's three network affiliates sent reporters to the convention, but devoted a lot less time to what was going on. Thursday night, in fact, none led the 6 o'clock programs with political news; at 11 p.m., the speech moved up to the off-lead position on WNBC. ''But first,'' Chuck Scarborough, the anchor, announced as an introduction to a piece about a death from E. coli bacteria, ''a family copes with tragedy.''</p>
        <p>KNX, an all-news radio station in Los Angeles, site of the Democratic convention next week, sent two reporters to Philadelphia and broadcast reports from there for 9 to 10 minutes every hour. And talk radio in Boston, a Democratic town, was nonetheless consumed with the topic on the night of Mr. Bush's speech. ''The crowd tonight would applaud and go crazy,'' said Jon Keller, a WBZ radio commentator reporting from the convention floor, ''if he held up a piece of French toast.''</p>
        <p>The sense that the response was preordained is probably what turns off many potential viewers and listeners. Though the number of people who follow convention coverage locally is hard to measure, nationally the viewership was down. On the three major networks, for instance, an average of 16.6 million viewers watched the 1996 Republican convention on a given night; this year, the number dropped to 16.1 million.</p>
        <p>Locally, the numbers were off, too. In Atlanta, for instance, according to Ray Carter, news director for the market-leading WSB-TV, an average of about 88,500 households watched this year's convention, down from 118,600 in 1996. In fact, at 10 p.m. Thursday, when Atlanta's big three affiliates carried Mr. Bush's speech in its entirety, they were easily beaten by the Fox affiliate, WAGA, which chose to run its regular newscast with only about eight and a half minutes of convention coverage.</p>
        <p>''It's the consummation of the 'showbizification' of politics,'' Martin Kaplan, associate dean of the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Southern California, said of the convention. ''Whether it was better entertainment than 'Survivor,' that the audience has already voted on.''</p>
        <p>Almost invariably, the local stations had agendas in Philadelphia customized to stories in their own backyards.</p>
        <p>Glen Horn, executive producer of WFOR, a CBS affiliate in Miami, said his reporter, Elliott Rodriguez, covered a meeting Mr. Bush held with Hispanics.</p>
        <p>Not that any of it had the bite of a juicy crime story. ''I don't think that it had any great surprises,'' Mr. Horn said. ''Does it even have the drama of conventions gone by? No. But it's part of our history and for that reason alone we pay special attention.''</p>
        <p>Even so, WLS, Chicago's ABC affiliate, found a home-grown angle with a little mischief in it.</p>
        <p>The station covered a bomb scare in a Philadelphia hotel set off innocently by ticking clocks in a box. The clocks belonged to the Illinois attorney general, Jim Ryan, who planned to give them away as mementos. Fans attending a ''Star Trek'' convention had to be evacuated.</p>
        <p>''We had a shot with a Vulcan in it,'' said Eric Lerner, the station's news director. He liked the story so much he ran it twice.</p>
