        <p>Churches are as integral to life in Harlem as trattorias to Little Italy, dive bars to the East Village and chain stores to the Upper West Side.</p>
        <p>Mostly, people in Harlem have seen their religious institutions as agents of positive change. So, residents of Harlem's western neighborhoods, Sugar Hill and Hamilton Heights, were particularly disturbed when they recently learned about development projects being undertaken by two local churches. Because both projects are in areas that have been nominated for inclusion in historic districts, neighbors said they were worried that important parts of Harlem's history would be lost.</p>
        <p>Luana Robinson, who has lived on West 154th Street, in Sugar Hill, since 1980, was dismayed about two months ago, when a Seventh-day Adventists church bought 883 St. Nicholas Avenue, between West 154th and 155th, and began gut renovation.</p>
        <p>The house is one of three 19th-century row houses with large stoops set back off the street, and Ms. Robinson expressed concern that the alteration would destroy the character of the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>''They're taking down all the old fashioned cornices, all the beautiful old decorations on these houses,'' she said, ''and that's what makes these old homes valuable.''</p>
        <p>She also has complained repeatedly to the police, the city's buildings department and the health department about security on the site, which she said was so poor that it invited loitering. She said debris from the construction was piled beneath her windows. Officials at the Seventh-day Adventists church did not respond to repeated requests for comment.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, neighbors of the 14th Church of Christ, Scientist, on 141st Street between Hamilton Place and Broadway, in Hamilton Heights, said they were concerned that the church might sell two adjoining 19th century limestone row houses at 553 and 555 West 141st Street to developers who might demolish them.</p>
        <p>Judith E. Matloff, who lives on West 141st Street, said she had spoken to members of the congregation who told her that the church was taking bids on the property and that one of the proposed plans was a high rise.</p>
        <p>Church of Christ, Scientist, officials declined to comment.</p>
        <p>''People are very very upset here,'' Ms. Matloff said. ''The one thing that has created stability in the neighborhood in recent years is home ownership, and the last thing we need is a high rise.''</p>
