        <p>Many readers responded to Peter Applebome's July 23 Soapbox column about racial mores and suburban manners at a gas station in Westchester County. The problem the column posed was what, if anything, to say to or do about the black gentleman sharing his expletive-laden music with the world and also Mr. Applebome's 9-year-old daughter.</p>
        <p>Here is a sampling of readers' reactions.</p>
        <p>Your piece on the service station nonconfrontation struck a sympathetic chord in me.</p>

        <p>Many readers responded to Peter Applebome's July 23 Soapbox column about racial mores and suburban manners at a gas station in Westchester County. The problem the column posed was what, if anything, to say to or do about the black gentleman sharing his expletive-laden music with the world and also Mr. Applebome's 9-year-old daughter.</p>
        <p>Here is a sampling of readers' reactions.</p>
        <p>Your piece on the service station nonconfrontation struck a sympathetic chord in me.</p>
        <p>I've even taken the time to learn from my 18-year-old about the differences in rap (Dr. Dre vs. Eminem, for example). But I'm not certain that you and I are so concerned about the music. And not really about race, for that matter. For me it's the rudeness and lack of the simplest level of civility.</p>
        <p>We could call it an in-your-face mentality, but even that requires some degree of concern for the other person, albeit a negative concern.</p>
        <p>I think what bothers us is a degree of solipsism that we try to wean our children from, certainly by age 4. We are dealing with a cultural phenomenon that stems from everyone believing what Mr. Rogers said about everyone being special. If everyone thinks he or she is special, then what we all want individually is all that counts.</p>
        <p>So I'll play my music the way I want to because I'm special. I don't recognize the others. I'm indifferent. That's the part that chills my soul. The indifference.</p>
        <p>I don't think it's race, age, ethnicity or religion. I think it's America.</p>
        <p>I've been an educator for 40 years, and I peg the mid-to-late 70's as the time when this indifference started. Everyone had to get in touch with his and her feelings. And then express them. Whether anyone else cared about those feelings was irrelevant.</p>
        <p>And so it grew, and so it goes.</p>
