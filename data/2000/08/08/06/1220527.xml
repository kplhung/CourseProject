        <p>I ONCE disdained cannas, but that was before I met Cleopatra. And before encountering Aaron, I was among those who looked down on caladiums.</p>
        <p>Maybe we've all loosened up a bit, or perhaps summer bulbs have improved their image. For whatever reason, summer bulbs are way cool again.</p>
        <p>Until fairly recently, it seemed that cannas served mostly as bull's eyes in the center of Victorian circles, those little islands of blazing color stranded on the expansive lawn of the town bank or post office.</p>
        <p>You saw them loitering in bedding displays, balancing their eye-popping blossoms on top of long, spear-shaped green leaves. But, back then, cannas were in the same category as marigolds, bright red bedding geraniums and wax begonias.</p>
        <p>Well, all that has changed. Cannas are now downright trendy, filling a new job description: punctuation marks in the perennial garden. Polite society may still frown on parading cannas in ribbon borders, but a well-placed canna or two as an accent among more discreet perennials is usually applauded.</p>
        <p>With one little difference. Nowadays, many gardeners snip off the bright orange, patriotic scarlet or school-bus-yellow blossoms. Although the Victorians put considerable effort into breeding low-maintenance orchid-size blossoms that drop off after they bloom, that trait is no longer the main draw. Instead, it's the side show that gardeners now find appealing. Somewhere back in the 19th century, one of the orchid-flowering cannas that became known as Cleopatra had burgundy-striped leaves. It also had harlequin yellow, red or spotted flowers side by side in the same umbel. The Victorians liked that sort of thing.</p>
        <p>More recently, breeders have enhanced the leaf colors, resulting in such popular hybrids as Pretoria (alias Bengal Tiger) with yellow-striped foliage. If a six-foot plant is more than you can handle, there are ''dwarf'' versions, like Striped Beauty and Striata, with all the visual kicks but condensed to a relatively compact four feet. Alice McGowan of Blue Meadow Farm in Montague Center, Mass., which specializes in rare annuals and perennials, said that Striata is a best seller in their catalog, second only to Panache.</p>
        <p>Why is Panache popular? ''Because it has discreet, cream-colored blossoms,'' she said. ''Some people still retain their longstanding prejudice, but cannas are rising in popularity, just like coleus.''</p>
        <p>The same could be said for several other summer bulbs. Take colocasias, for example. Brent Heath of Brent &amp; Becky's Bulbs in Gloucester, Va., which specializes in bulbs for all seasons, said colocasias are so popular now that they can't keep them in stock. Commonly known as elephant's ear because of its enormous foliage, which is deeply veined and billows in breezes, Colocasia esculenta was another denizen of shady Victorian circles -- surrounded by impatiens or ferns, perhaps. It is now used in containers, especially the Cranberry Taro, with its dark red veins, and Black Magic, with its lustrous purplish black leaves.</p>
        <p>Mr. Heath never met a bulb he didn't like. But he ranks caladiums high on his roster of up-and-comers. Like colocasias, they have seemed like too much of a good thing for many gardeners. These shade-loving, heart-leaved plants were splashed, spangled and zoned with several different colors.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the older varieties scorched easily. Recently, the Florida series has produced thicker-leaved, light-tolerant versions. In addition, many quieter hybrids are now on the market, like the luminous white-veined Aaron and rose-veined Florida Sweetheart.</p>
        <p>Flashy leaves are part of the lure, but flowers are definitely a factor.</p>
        <p>Dahlias, too, have hit their stride again. But they're not quite as buxom as the versions that were coddled in greenhouses a century ago.</p>
        <p>Lilies never really lagged in popularity, but calla lilies have been subject to fashion's yo-yo. Perhaps for good reason: in gardens north of New York, flowers rarely arrive before frost threatens.</p>
        <p>New varieties, however, have intriguing leaves as well as a blossom or two before the time comes to dig the bulbs up and transform them into houseplants.</p>
        <p>Likewise, tuberoses often fail to fit their cycle into our growing season.</p>
        <p>Brent Heath's solution is to start them indoors in April on a heat mat. ''All summer bulbs like warmth,'' he explained, ''and most prefer moisture. Given that, they'll thrive.''</p>
        <p>Calla lilies and tuberoses aside, however, most bulbs perform just when you need them to. Indeed, one reason for summer bulbs' new popularity might be that most of them swing into action immediately in hot weather, filling the gap when the garden is mired in midsummer lull.</p>
        <p>If you don't mind the chore of digging the bulbs up in autumn and bringing them into a frost-free place, few plants could be easier to please than amaryllis-like crinums or spider-shaped hymenocallis. For a splash of midseason color, just add a crocosmia, with its long wands of bright tubular blossoms jutting from iris-like leaves. If you yearn for fragrance as well, opt for acidanthera, recently redesignated as Gladiolus callianthus, with white maroon-marked nodding star-shaped blossoms on long spikes, a 19th-century heirloom that has slipped back into the limelight.</p>
        <p>Which brings us to another summer bulb that has yet to be re-embraced: gladiolus. Tall, elegant, great for cut flowers and easy to grow if you don't mind staking stately spires dense with blossoms in all colors of the rainbow, gladioluses have one major strike against them, which is that many people associate them with funeral parlors.</p>
        <p>But the way I figure it, if cannas overcame the obstructions of taste, can glads be far behind?</p>
