        <p>SINCE the Exploratorium was founded here 31 years ago as an innovative ''museum of science, art and human perception,'' it has taken pride in breaking traditional museum rules. Mixing science exhibits and artworks with little concern about which is which, the Exploratorium encourages a giddily high level of interactivity, inviting visitors not just to stand and contemplate but to touch, pump, spin or otherwise mess around with most of the 600-plus items on display.</p>
        <p>This summer, however, a few distinguished visitors are being treated with decidedly old-fashioned formality.</p>
        <p>One of them is the ''Medical Venus,'' a lifesize and alarmingly lifelike 18th-century Italian wax sculpture of a young beauty who lies in a swoon on pink damask cushions. It's hardly surprising she feels faint, since she's not only naked but cut open from stem to stern to reveal her heart, liver and other viscera, as beautifully made as the rest of her dainty person.</p>
        <p>The Venus, who hails from the Museo La Specola in Florence, is making her first appearance in the United States as one of the star turns in ''Revealing Bodies,'' which runs through Sept. 4. The show uses an array of artifacts and artworks to demonstrate that our view of human anatomy has always been informed as much by culture as science.</p>
        <p>And for the first time in the Exploratorium's history, this temporary exhibition has been given a traditional gallery-style installation off to one side of the museum, acoustically and visually segregated from the whirling, flashing, wiggling exhibits on the cavernous main exhibition floor. Moreover, while dozens of the exhibits in ''Revealing Bodies'' welcome participation, the Venus and other items are tucked safely under glass -- no interactivity allowed.</p>
        <p>''This is our first attempt to do something like this, but 'Revealing Bodies' is where we're headed,'' said Kathleen McLean, the Exploratorium's director of public programs. While more traditional museums try to move toward greater interactivity and livelier, less contemplative exhibitions, she said, for the Exploratorium, doing something new and different means ''creating more environments for focus and reflection and slowing down.''</p>
        <p>That strategy isn't sitting well with everyone. ''There's been a lot of concern here among staff that we're going to slip into being just another museum,'' Ms. McLean said. ''But I don't think very many museums could have done the 'Revealing Bodies' show.''</p>
        <p>For while ''Revealing Bodies'' may be straitlaced by Exploratorium standards, its multicultural, cross-disciplinary blend of art, science and participatory technologies is very much in the institution's mold-breaking tradition.</p>
        <p>Along with the ''Medical Venus,'' the show includes African carved figures used in healing rituals, prosthetic legs from a variety of eras and cultures, Ken Wilkes's elegant, horrifying photographs of dissections, a screen that displays the heat emanating from the viewer's body in vivid colors, historic and contemporary X-rays and copies of astonishingly varied medical drawings from 17th-century Persia, 16th-century Holland and 1920's France.</p>
        <p>Within the relatively staid ''Revealing Bodies'' environment, there's also plenty of hard science and a number of the kind of interactive exhibits that the Exploratorium is famous for. For example, visitors can draw their own silhouette, peer into the inside of their own eyes or page through a giant flipbook-style display of the ''Visible Humans,'' two corpses (one male, one female) that were frozen, milled from the feet up removing a paper-thin section at a time, photographed and reassembled as stacks of digital images that look disturbingly like human-shaped slices of headcheese.</p>
        <p>But these days, when so much of contemporary art aims to subvert rather than investigate the truth, it can be problematic to bring art into a science museum. So if one source of internal controversy about the ''Revealing Bodies'' show is its artiness, another is that some of the artworks look too much like science, while turning scientific realities topsy-turvy.</p>
        <p>One example is the ''Face Value'' machine created by the British artist Alexa Wright and the computer scientist Alf Linney. ''Face Value'' compares the viewer's face to a composite portrait of some 200 other visitors, then spits out a ''personal face reading'' that purports to use that comparison to define character. The readings are nonsense, of course, a commentary on our naive willingness to trust both technology and first impressions. But Melissa Alexander, the show's project director, said some Exploratorium staff worried that visitors would assume that ''Face Value'' was as real as a nearby exhibit that lets them hear their lungs at work.</p>
        <p>Another source of potential confusion is the New York artist Scott Serrano's curiosity cabinet of drawings, artifacts and photographs telling the story of a 19th-century anatomist, Wilson Quain, a man so ''science-intoxicated'' that he took to dissecting himself. Quain is a fiction, but on one recent afternoon several visitors clearly believed he was a historical figure. ''How could anyone do that to themselves?'' one mother exclaimed as she and her child stared at a series of animated digital photographs of Quain (played by Mr. Serrano) apparently peeling off his own face. They were too horrified to notice that the photographs obviously dated from the 21st rather than the 19th century.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the show's juxtaposition of the fine and the medical arts is stimulating on all fronts, highlighting the formal beauty of the latter and the sometimes grim reality embedded in the former. An artificial heart made of shiny metal and intricate swirls of plastic could pass for a sinisterly futuristic sculpture. Rosamund Purcell's stunning photograph of a dissected hand, which on a conventional gallery wall might too easily be seen as merely an arty novelty, becomes a moving reminder of all the ways the living feed on the dead when it's juxtaposed with a set of three dissected, mummified hands used as teaching aids a century ago.</p>
        <p>''The distinction between art and science didn't always exist in our culture,'' Ms. Alexander said. ''The Venus is proof that they used to be much closer together. And the Exploratorium was based on the idea of not making any distinction.''</p>
        <p>That course was set by the museum's founder, Frank Oppenheimer, a brilliant physicist and teacher who worked with his brother, Robert, on the development of the atomic bomb. Where most museums expected people to absorb information passively, like students sitting in a lecture hall, Oppenheimer sought to create a place that would emphasize play rather than pretension, where visitors could do their own experiments and make their own educational leaps. From the beginning, artists and scientists have worked side by side in the museum's workshop, using scientific phenomena as the basis for exhibits that inspire  aesthetic delight as well as curiosity about how the natural world works.</p>
        <p>Since the Exploratorium opened in 1969, its innovative ideas have been adopted by museums all over the world. But Oppenheimer's vision tended to scant the cultural side of the art-science partnership, focusing more on science phenomena and less on their social interpretations and ramifications. Moreover, the institution's anti-museum environment -- dark, noisy and usually full of excited children dashing from one activity to the next -- favors the didactic over the contemplative, and sometimes hyperactivity over either.</p>
        <p>Following Oppenheimer's death in 1985, his successors have struggled to keep his vision alive while coping with sometimes rancorous internal disagreements about future directions. What to some looks like greater professionalism to others looks perilously close to selling out.</p>
        <p>''There's a new emphasis on making everything clean and organized,'' said Joe Ansel, an exhibition designer who worked at the Exploratorium from 1972 to 1992. ''I think they see that as the better way, but it's really the more conventional way.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. McLean is confident that ''Revealing Bodies'' marks a step forward rather than a retreat. ''I'm planning to install more of these kinds of shows so that we can offer a variety of experiences, from wild, crazy, chaotic, open spaces to quiet, reflective spaces,'' she said. ''At the Exploratorium we're so fixed on the kinds of experiences we've done in the past, which were so powerful, that it's hard for some people to see how inventive and experimental a show like 'Revealing Bodies' is.''</p>
