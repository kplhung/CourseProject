        <p>Strategists at S.M.E. Power Branding, which specializes in athletic branding, have cured Elon College in North Caroline of its identity crisis. In May, after four months and $40,000 in focus groups and consultations (read: institutional gestalt therapy), the college, which has graduated to Division I athletics, selected a new identity - the Phoenix.</p>
        <p>The Fightin' Christian, the old leprechaun-like mascot and moniker, was misleading, said Chris Marciani, director of business development at S.M.E.; not only is Elon a secular institution (although it was founded by a predecessor of the United Church of Christ 111 years ago), but Christians do not customarily advocate fightin'.</p>
        <p>''The students were embarassed when confronted in public about the name,'' said George Dennis, Elon's homecoming king and captain of the men's basketball team.</p>
        <p>''During athlectic competition, we were ridiculed whenever we were on the road.''</p>
        <p>Of the 125 names considered - including Fat-Tailed Geckos ad Rancorous Existentialists - Golden Eagles, Mighty Oaks, Elon Express and the Phoenix made the final cut. A 15-member task force of students, faculty members and coaches picked the mythological bird for its graphic viability, class and relevance (Elon, too, rose from the ashes after the devastating fire in 1923).</p>
        <p>But a name-change is just the first step in building school spirit, according to Mr. Marciani, whose newest client is the United States Military Academy at West Point, which is seeking a more contemporary look for its mascot, the donkey, and nickname, Black Knights.</p>
        <p>To make the Phoenix identity more than just a name, Elon still needs a fight song, mascot, uniforms, letterhead and brand-related merchandise. S.M.E. has helped reshape the identities of some 145 universities, often when they were seeking to make a national impression during an athletic division upgrade.</p>
