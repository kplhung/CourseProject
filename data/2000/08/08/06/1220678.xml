        <p>No, Jason Giambi said, he was not responsible for his team's acquisition of his brother, Jeremy, earlier this year.</p>
        <p>''Billy approached me about it,'' Giambi, Oakland's most productive hitter, said recently, referring to the team's general manager, Billy Beane. ''He said: 'We want to get your brother.

        <p>No, Jason Giambi said, he was not responsible for his team's acquisition of his brother, Jeremy, earlier this year.</p>
        <p>''Billy approached me about it,'' Giambi, Oakland's most productive hitter, said recently, referring to the team's general manager, Billy Beane. ''He said: 'We want to get your brother. What do you think?' I'm like, 'Oh yeah, that'd be awesome.' So he went out and did it. It wasn't any of my doing. It was all Billy Beane's doing.''</p>
        <p>The Athletics are basically all Billy Beane's doing. A challenger for the American League West championship and the leader in the A.L. wild-card race, the Athletics are in Chicago this weekend playing the team with the league's best record, then come to New York for a three-game series with the Yankees that will end the most rigorous segment of their 2000 schedule.</p>
        <p>The Athletics will have played 10 successive series, a total of 30 games, against teams with winning records, and they will have lived to tell about it. After splitting the first two games with the White Sox, they have a 15-10 record in those games, having increased their wild-card lead from one and a half games to three and a half, and sliced their distance from Seattle from three games to two.</p>
        <p>Their position is somewhat remarkable considering that, in this age of payroll disparity, they have one of the five smallest payrolls in the major leagues. Among the lowest-paid players on that payroll are Mark Mulder and Barry Zito, rookie starting pitchers who epitomize the idea that the Athletics are ''all Billy Beane's doing.''</p>
        <p>Mulder and Zito, neither of whom began the season with Oakland, are pitching in only their second seasons professionally. Mulder turned 23 yesterday; Zito is 22. Both left-handers, they will start in the series against the Yankees.</p>
        <p>''We knew we had a covey of position players who were already here or would be here in the next year or two,'' Beane said, explaining the presence of the young pitchers. ''When we went into the Mulder and Zito drafts, we tried to find the most polished pitchers so they could be part of this. We passed on some pitchers who maybe had a higher upside but might not be ready as quickly. We needed to get pitching prospects here quickly to mesh with the good young position players.''</p>
        <p>The Athletics made Mulder the second player chosen in the 1998 draft; Zito was the ninth the next year. Mulder became a member of the Oakland rotation April 18 and responded with a 5-2 record in his first 13 starts. He has since slumped, going 1-5 in his next seven starts.</p>
        <p>Zito is a more recent addition, pitching his first major league game July 22 and gaining a 1-0 record and 2.37 earned run average in three starts.</p>
        <p>The rotation has another young pitcher, slightly more experienced than Mulder and Zito. Tim Hudson, 25, is the team's No. 1 starter in his fourth professional season, his second in the majors. He is scheduled to pitch against the White Sox today with his 12-3 record.</p>
        <p>The young position players Beane referred to are abundant, whether or not Jason Giambi, at 29 with a .321 average, 27 home runs and 95 runs batted in, qualifies. Shortstop Miguel Tejada is 24, third baseman Eric Chavez is 22, catcher Ramon Hernandez isi 24, left fielder Ben Grieve is 24 and center fielder Terrence Long is 24.</p>
        <p>Beane himself is 38, a former major league outfielder, whose wisdom was well ahead of his playing talent.</p>
        <p>''He sort of retired as a player on spot,'' Sandy Alderson recalled, ''when he found out the advance scouting position was open. He applied for the job and did a great job in that capacity.''</p>
        <p>Alderson was the Athletics' general manager when Beane played for them in 1989, the last season of his decidedly unspectacular career. Starting in the Mets' organization, Beane produced a .219 average in 148 games and 301 at-bats over six seasons. He has already accomplished more as a general manager, which he became in October 1997, after Alderson groomed him for the job.</p>
        <p>''There was a tremendous amount of enthusiasm for the game, an excitement for the game that translated into a great deal of energy and tremendous work ethic,'' said Alderson, now the top baseball operations executive in the commissioner's office. ''He just ate and slept the game. Beyond the enthusiasm, he's as intelligent as anyone I've ever met in the game. He grasped concepts and really was receptive to new ideas and different approaches to the game.''</p>
        <p>One approach that Beane has learned well is how to construct a team with a payroll less than a third of the Yankees' pay sheet. The Athletics have not won anything yet, but the real test for Beane will come if they do reach the playoffs for a couple of seasons and the good young players remain good.</p>
        <p>Those players will also accrue major league service time and will reach the point in their careers when they can become free agents. But the owners, not Beane, will determine the type of contracts the players are offered.</p>
        <p>Beane, meanwhile, will continue searching for good young players and making judicious trades, such as the two deals he made with the Mets last July that brought Long to the Athletics to play center field and Jason Isringhausen to be their closer.</p>
        <p>Isringhausen was not a closer in the Mets' system, but Beane saw the potential long distance. The 27-year-old right-hander has adapted well to this role, gaining 25 saves in 31 chances this season. Except for a four-game stretch early in May, during which he squandered three save chances, Isringhausen has been generally effective. His success has served as another example of Beane's ability.</p>
        <p>''I never had any doubt when I left that he would do an exceptional job,'' Alderson said of Beane. ''That's one of the reasons I felt comfortable leaving.''</p>
        <p>Everett's Tantrum Costly</p>
        <p>The 10-game suspension Carl Everett earned with his temper tantrum has ended, and none too soon for the Boston Red Sox. Without their No. 1 power hitter and run producer, the Red Sox won five and lost five, losing five of the eight games Pedro Martinez did not pitch.</p>
        <p>Obviously, no one knows what Everett might have done in those games (hitting, not erupting), but during his absence, the Red Sox averaged 3.8 runs a game compared with 5.4 in the 10 games before his suspension. Had they been able to score five or six runs a game in four of the five games they lost, the Red Sox would have won the games.</p>
        <p>As it was, they fell an additional two and one-half games behind the Yankees in the A.L. East without Everett.</p>
        <p>The Deal(s) With Surhoff</p>
        <p>Just about everyone the Yankees talked to in the weeks leading to the nonwaiver trading deadline wanted shortstop Alfonso Soriano. If they could have divided their top minor league prospect into several parts, the Yankees could have had any number of outfielders and pitchers.</p>
        <p>The Montreal Expos wanted Soriano for Rondell White. The Baltimore Orioles wanted Soriano for B. J. Surhoff. The San Diego Padres wanted Soriano for Surhoff. Whoa. How many teams does Surhoff play for?</p>
        <p>Right now only one, the Atlanta Braves, though the Mets would like to have acquired him for their outfield. But first story first.</p>
        <p>How could the Padres have had Surhoff and traded him to the Yankees for Soriano? By engineering a three-team deal that would have also included the Orioles.</p>
        <p>Under the plan, the Orioles would have sent Surhoff to San Diego for outfielder Eric Owens, catcher Carlo Hernandez and Jeremy Owens, a minor league outfielder. The Padres would then have packaged Surhoff with the starting pitcher Matt Clement and the reliever Donne Wall and shipped them to the Yankees for Soriano and several other minor leaguers.</p>
        <p>The germ of the three-way deal was the Yankees' attempt to get Clement for their starting rotation. But the teams couldn't agree on appropriate payment so Kevin Towers, the Padres' general manager, asked Brian Cashman, his Yankees counterpart, if there was another player he could get elsewhere to justify the package of players the Padres wanted. Surhoff, Cashman said.</p>
        <p>Talks between the Padres and the Orioles progressed to the point where Towers thought they could make a deal. But then Syd Thrift, the Orioles vice president for baseball operations, asked Towers this critical question: Are you getting Soriano in this deal?</p>
        <p>Why do you have to know, Towers replied. Because, Thrift said.</p>
        <p>Because if the Orioles gave the Padres Surhoff and he then went to the Yankees for the player the Orioles had wanted for Surhoff in direct talks with the Yankees, Thrift's standing with his employer, Peter Angelos, would not be worth a broken bat.</p>
        <p>So Towers felt obliged to admit that yes, he would be getting Soriano. End of three-way transaction.</p>
        <p>But the collapse of those talks prompted the Orioles to renew their effort to send Surhoff to the Yankees for Soriano. But the Yankees refused to change the stance they had held since the winter: they would not swap Soriano for Surhoff.</p>
        <p>The Mets wanted Surhoff, but when rumors cropped up last winter that he might be traded to the Mets, Surhoff, wanting to stay in Baltimore, placed the Mets on his no-trade list. The Braves weren't on it, so the Orioles traded him to Atlanta.</p>
        <p>Soriano, meanwhile, remains in the Yankees' organization.</p>
