        <p>WHEN the Chicago Board of Trade opened for trading at 9:30 a.m., Earle Combs IV, known as Chip, was doing what he loves to do -- jostling for position in the soybean pit with his arms raised high.</p>
        <p>''Sell 200 at a half! Sell 200 at a half!'' he shouted into a crowd of burly traders, as he tried to sell 200 soybean meal contracts at $156.50. ''Sell 200 at a half!''</p>
        <p>Casting a glance to the left, he spotted a buyer in the crowd, a man in his 40's wearing a trading jacket decorated with roulette wheels. Their eyes  met, and a nod from Mr. Combs completed the sale.</p>
        <p>The trade was made virtually the same way that Mr. Combs' father, grandfather and great-grandfather would have been done it -- by two men winking and nodding across a frenzied trading pit, then recording the sale on index-sized trading cards.</p>
        <p>''That's the way it's been done here for more than 150 years,'' said Mr. Combs, who is 41.</p>
        <p>These days, however, more efficient and accurate computerized trading is threatening to wipe out Chicago's 19th-century trading pits, just as it did in London last year. And, some experts say, the demise of the ''open outcry'' method of trading -- the shouting and flashing of hand signals into a trading pit -- might doom the exchange itself.</p>
        <p>After more than a century and a half of dominating the sale of commodities, beginning with corn and soybeans, and expanding to include products like futures on Treasury bond prices, the Chicago Board of Trade, the nation's oldest derivatives exchange, can no longer lay claim to also being the world's largest. That honor belongs to Eurex, a fast-growing fully electronic market in Germany that was created only two years ago.</p>
        <p>Though the Board of Trade remains a force in the United States futures market, industry experts say the exchange's reluctance to adopt computer technology and its stubborn defense of face-to-face pit trading may be its undoing.</p>
        <p>''Unless they adapt in the next 18 months, it's over,'' said Richard L. Sandor, who helped introduce financial futures at the board in the 1970's. ''This is the endgame; this is not the opening or middle game. They have to get going.''</p>
        <p>New rivals are moving quickly to introduce their own electronic trading systems. Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs are part of a group of Wall Street firms that are planning to go head-to-head with the Board of Trade by creating computerized systems that they say will sharply reduce trading costs. Independently, Cantor Fitzgerald, the huge bond-dealing firm, also wants to grab a share of the electronic futures market.</p>
        <p>The rivals' chief target is financial futures, a multibillion-dollar marketplace where investors buy and sell futures to hedge against a shift in the value of stocks, bonds and currencies. Industry experts say screen-based trading is more efficient and can reduce or eliminate the need for a trading floor.</p>
        <p>As a result, the Chicago Board of Trade, which opened a new 60,000-square-foot trading floor three years ago, is facing its biggest challenge. And because control of the exchange rests largely with a group of agricultural traders who favor the auction-like style of open-outcry trading, exchange leaders have had to confront some difficult choices.</p>
        <p>If the exchange decides to adopt a fully electronic trading system -- and it is inching in that direction, offering experimental computer trading and starting a joint venture with Eurex -- members fear that it could doom the open-outcry system, eliminating the jobs of thousands of men and women who have staked their careers on face-to-face buying and selling.</p>
        <p>But if the Board of Trade insists on continuing to do most of its business through pit trading, the exchange could be outflanked by a fledgling electronic rival in the United States futures market.</p>
        <p>SOMETHING similar happened in Europe in 1998, after the Eurex electronic trading system in Germany went head-to-head with Liffe, the London financial futures exchange, which operated with a giant trading floor. The results: business dried up for Liffe, which just a few years ago was Europe's biggest futures exchange, and it was forced to abandon its trading pits in favor of computer trading.</p>
        <p>In France, Matif, the derivatives exchange that is a unit of the Paris bourse, tried to offer both electronic and open-outcry trading in April 1998. A month later, most trading migrated to computers and the trading floor was shuttered.</p>
        <p>''Floor trading is dead,'' says Benn Steil, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. ''It's not going to be pretty, but it's going to happen in a short, sharp shock. That's what happened in Europe.''</p>
        <p>In some ways echoing Matif's approach, the Board of Trade would also like to offer both types of trading. The Board plans to split itself in two: one company offering traditional floor trading and a competing one devoted to electronic trading. The exact framework of such a split is unclear, however, and will require a vote of the membership.</p>
        <p>The exchange has also vowed to make its operations more efficient, by moving orders into the pits via computers, rather than by using legions of clerks and ''runners'' who have long crowded the exchange floor.</p>
        <p>For now, however, the floor operates essentially as it did a century ago. Clerks and runners take orders by phone, dash to deliver them to traders in the 1,200-square-foot octagonal pits, return with messages to the brokerage stations. The floor is littered with paper: orders, erroneous trade tickets, lunch orders.</p>
        <p>It is as inefficient as it is colorful. There are more clerks than traders; many sit around reading papers and gossiping during trading lulls.</p>
        <p>When a trader sells, he might catch an eye, a nod, a tap from someone agreeing to buy. They record each other's badge acronym and the size of the trade. But there are frequent mistakes. Every morning, traders gather in a lobby just off the floor to check ''out trades'' -- transactions that did not match up the previous day.</p>
        <p>The financial trading floor, where futures on interest rates are traded, is more automated. But no derivatives exchange in the United States is as paper-heavy as the Chicago Board of Trade, and none have been as late to the game with technology.</p>
        <p>Advocates of electronic trading say it ends the need for a trading floor and all that it requires: clerks, runners, security officers, booths and so on. An electronic system, they note, simply posts and matches all prices and automatically clears and distributes the information.</p>
        <p>Behind the board's delay in implementing technology is the membership's longstanding reluctance to change the floor, or to alter an environment and a trading style that has worked for generations.</p>
        <p>Giving up the old way will not be easy for traders, many of whom are the second, third or even fourth generation of their family in the pits. Chip Combs's family, for example, is in its second century of working at the Board of Trade.</p>
        <p>Mr. Combs's great-grandfather, Earle M. Combs, bought a membership in 1898, when the Board of Trade was largely a marketplace for farmers to sell their corn and soybeans. His grandfather, the second Earle, worked through the Great Depression. And his father, Earle III, was a soybean trader for 35 years.</p>
        <p>LIKE many other people here, Chip Combs and his father say they never intended to work the floor. It just sort of happened.</p>
        <p>Earle Combs III, now 70 and retired, says he first tried to be a photographer. But when his father's partner died in 1952, he came to the floor and immediately fell in love with the business.</p>
        <p>When he arrived, Morse code was used to relay trades, grain prices were still listed on a chalk board and the exchange was largely a gentlemen's club, a place where members would enjoy a cigar on the edge of a pit after completing a trade.</p>
        <p>Chip Combs and his younger brother Rick followed their father to the floor. Rick didn't stay long, though. He left to become a salesman after a man for whom he was working committed suicide during a nasty market downturn. Chip, after briefly considering working as a banker, was eventually bitten by the trading bug and had a more auspicious start.</p>
        <p>He was, after all, Earle IV, the nicknamed ''chip'' off the old block. And while he says he felt no pressure to come to the Board, he grew up surrounded by the lore of the industry. As a boy, he saw images of the Board everywhere. At home, his father kept a large piece of marble that once rested inside the foyer of the old Board of Trade building, which was demolished in the 1920's. Later, vacations were spent at a log cabin in Wisconsin that his father had built in the shape of a trading pit.</p>
        <p>''Early on, I'd come down with a big trading jacket with sleeves down to the floor and my father would put trading cards in my pocket,'' he recalled. ''Standing by the pit, he seemed to know everyone in the world.''</p>
        <p>When Chip Combs started trading in the pits, colleagues joked that he would be a natural. It was all in the genes, they said. He recalled someone saying: ''Oh, you're Earle Combs's son. All you have to do is stand next to him in the pit. If he goes this way, you go that way.''</p>
        <p>For the last 16 years, he has made a good living on the floor. He commutes each day from Barrington, Ill., about 40 miles northwest of Chicago, where he lives with his wife, Karla,  and four children. He gets to the office at 7 each day. Between 9:30 a.m. and 1:15 p.m., he trades in the soybean meal pit, speculating on futures in the way that a day trader speculates in the stock market.</p>
        <p>His edge, he says, is being able to read the market by knowing the pit: the faces, gestures, positions and idiosyncrasies of people on the trading floor.</p>
        <p>For a while, he commuted by train with his father, and they swapped trading stories. But now that his father is retired, he comes in alone, sometimes pondering whether there will still be a trading floor when his children come of age.</p>
        <p>On the wall in his office is a portrait of Chip with his father and his 7-year-old son Marty, actually Earle Martin Combs V, now 14. Marty and his brother Matthew have both made the ritual trip to the floor in long-sleeved trading jackets. And their father and grandfather have already offered lessons in how to fill out a trading ticket.</p>
        <p>These days, Chip is worried about his own situation. He is concerned about the edge he would lose if the floor closed; if it did, he would probably have to move to the computer. He loves the energy of the floor, the emotion and the culture. He loves being part of a daily drama in which billions of dollars are funneled through a group of frenzied traders. And he loves the rush of making a great trade.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the pit is filled with personality. And families. Most of the agricultural pits are populated by second- and third-generation traders.</p>
        <p>The genealogy of the trading pits even includes David A. Brennan, 42,  the chairman of the Board of Trade -- and the man charged with moving the exchange forward in these perilous times. From time to time, Mr. Brennan still works the agriculture pits with his 77-year-old father and three brothers. His grandfather was on the floor at the turn of the century.</p>
        <p>The corn pit may have more families than any other. There are the Murrays, the McBrides and Andrew Flakus, a 23-year-old clerk who aspires to trade alongside his father and two brothers. There is John Pietrzak, a 44-year-old man with frayed vocal cords who followed his father and his grandfather into the pits, after working as an accountant. And there is Ted Dangles. When he retired as a clerk at another exchange at 76, his son Angelo, a trader in the agriculture pits, got him a job as a runner; today, at 89, he still scampers across the trading floor.</p>
        <p>The floor, however, is no longer confined to men. Mary Guth, who has worked at the exchange for 25 years, followed her father and her brothers there, as did her two sisters. And after graduating from journalism school, Kelly A. King joined her father, Richard King, known as Whitey, in the corn pit, where they now trade side by side.</p>
        <p>MANY traders cannot explain exactly what attracted them. They mention the adrenaline and the camaraderie --  the sense of community and family -- and even the danger. Visitors can sense the energy while watching the scene, hearing the voices in the crowd, the sounds of friendship that pass beneath the din of trading.</p>
        <p>''I just remember coming down here as a boy and liking it,'' said Terry Cullerton, a third-generation trader. ''I guess I thought it was thrilling; this was exciting. It got your blood going.''</p>
        <p>The pay can also be hefty. Although there are no official figures, people on the floor say traders' annual earnings often run well into the six figures, and that many make millions of dollars a year speculating; it's the kind of money that dazzles the young clerks, many of whom are high school and college age.</p>
        <p>''My girlfriend works in the bond pits and her boss made $12 million last year,'' said one clerk pacing the agriculture floor.</p>
        <p>On any given day, there are about 100 high-energy traders in the corn pit. They say they love the crowds and the sounds there, including the gong that signals the opening of trading. Many also love the hours, which let them head home by 2 p.m.</p>
        <p>And many are skeptics when it comes to electronic trading. There are some things that a computer cannot do, they say. And chaotic as the current system appears, they note that it has worked for generations. ''This is something that cannot be replicated electronically,'' said Jacob J. Morowitz, a longtime soybean trader. ''On the computer it's a single file, and the thing is much more susceptible to being dominated by the bigger players.''</p>
        <p>They also worry about the cost. One day a few weeks ago, Whitey King stepped out of the pit holding a copy of The Chicago Sun-Times. A small article said the Board of Trade was planning to spend $100 million over the next decade on trading technology. Some members are already grousing about higher fees they would have to pay to the board.</p>
        <p>''How are we going to pay for that?'' Mr. King said, pointing to the article.</p>
        <p>Deep down, though, many people here know that the computer is coming. And they fear that they will not  be able to compete.</p>
        <p>''If you have talents, they might be minimized on the screen,'' says Jeff Nicolaus, a trader in the corn pit. ''It might become how fast you can press a button. Sometimes here, opportunity is location, location, location. You won't find that on a computer screen.</p>
        <p>''There's a theory here that these bodies down here are lubricants; it's a whole different style of trading on computer. People go upstairs and they miss the feel of the pit; there's emotion here.''</p>
        <p>Then he turned his back and jumped into the pit to execute a trade.</p>
        <p>Still, some traders are making the transition. John Pietrzak is trading overnight on Project A, the Board's modest attempt at electronic trading. Terry Cullerton's sons, Terry Jr. and Jaime, both in their 20's, are also trading after-hours on Project A, preparing for the time when everything may be electronic.</p>
        <p>LIKE Chip Combs, many people here know that something has to happen. Even if the floor survives, everyone knows that it won't be the same; it's too antiquated.</p>
        <p>And the pressure couldn't have come at a worse time. With volume down 9 percent this year, in part because the federal government is selling fewer Treasury bonds, the Board of Trade has now fallen into second place among derivatives exchanges in Chicago, behind the Chicago Board Options Exchange.</p>
        <p>Thomas Baldwin, a legendary bond trader here, quit a few months ago after 20 years on the floor. He earned millions by trading up to 5 percent of the pit volume. But in recent months, that activity has slowed.</p>
        <p>''I was standing in the bond pits just wasting my time,'' he said in a recent interview. ''I'm definitely leaving the bond pits. I'm trading Nasdaq stocks. I'm staring at a computer screen right now. This is where it's at now.''</p>
        <p>Sensing bad times ahead, Merrill Lynch decided last January to close its agricultural futures operation and vacate a prime spot at the exchange's landmark Art Deco building.</p>
        <p>In a sign of the times, that space is now being rented by Yestrader.com, a high-technology start-up run by a former pit trader who is developing trading software for those who want to make the leap into the wired world.</p>
        <p>The Board of Trade is making its own leap by forming the alliance with Eurex. The Board will scrap Project A later this month and use Eurex technology to allow traders to sell futures online. But some members worry that the exchange is already far behind. Instead of investing heavily in technology a few years ago, the board spent $182 million to build the giant trading floor that opened in 1997.</p>
        <p>Now, with talk about trading floors around the country being shuttered, the Board is trying to cut costs and pay down a mounting debt load.</p>
        <p>Les Rosenthal, a former head of the Board of Trade, says the exchange erred in building the new trading floor and in failing to develop its own technology. But it made another mistake, he said, in failing to team up with its sister exchanges in Chicago, a move that he said would allow the three big exchanges here to share technology and back-office expenses.</p>
        <p>''This is survival time, and they're doing it all the wrong way,'' he said. ''The basic plan should be the Merc, the C.B.O.E. and the Board should be united on a single plan. But they'd rather make alliances with people overseas than across the street. They're going on these divergent paths and they're all going to end up dying.''</p>
        <p>BUT Chicago -- long considered a center of innovation -- still has a chance, the experts say. After all, it was the city that created the concept of financial futures and exported it to the rest of the world.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sandor said Chicago could be saved by a resilient, risk-taking set of people.</p>
        <p>And Leo Melamed, the former chairman of the Merc and the man credited with introducing financial futures, says the members must  wake up to the fact that new opportunities can come from technology, including a larger pool of investors and online traders.</p>
        <p>''The guys who want open outcry are looking at the back end of the telescope because they've made money in the past,'' Mr. Melamed said. ''But the past doesn't hold a candle to what's going to be made in the future.''</p>
        <p>The message may be getting through to the pits. There was talk one late July day about more traders taking computer courses. And while few think that the floor will disappear in the next few months, many are looking ahead by trading online through Project A -- learning the language of the computer.</p>
        <p>For Chip Combs, that means getting up at 3:45 a.m. to trade in the after-hours market. He is beginning to get a sense of a wider market waiting to be tapped through the keyboard -- albeit reluctantly.</p>
        <p>In the office, he and his father  agree. The history of the floor is great, the elder Earle said, but it may go the way of the buggy whip.</p>
        <p>''Businesses can't succeed on nostalgia,'' he said, pondering the floor's fate. ''If it's electronic, so be it.''</p>
