        <p>Rashard Casey does not talk or act like a man who is worried about going to jail after being charged with assaulting an off-duty police officer in a racially charged street fight last spring. Casey, a senior and the first-string quarterback of the Penn State football team, said today ''If I could talk, I'd talk'' about that incident outside a nightclub in his hometown of Hoboken, N.J., on May 14.</p>
        <p>But his coach, Joe Paterno, and his lawyer have advised Casey, 22, not to discuss the matter while it is pending on two different legal tracks. So Casey alluded to it only elliptically today at a news conference as the Nittany Lions gathered for the beginning of formal practice for the 2000 season.</p>
        <p>When asked if he is embarrassed that his legal affairs are overshadowing Paterno's quest for a prestigious personal record, Casey said he has ''nothing to be embarrassed about'' and added, ''I'm pretty sure the focus will turn to him sooner or later. Everybody will get tired of talking about me and start talking about him.</p>
        <p>''When you're in my shoes, and something like that nonsense, which I call it, happened, things come out and people write things and say things. You live with it and grow from it. I'm ready for it to pass. You learn a lot from things that happen in your life. It's just something I have to learn from.''</p>
        <p>When asked about his frame of mind, Casey said: ''My spirits are fine. They've been fine. I don't think I have anything to hang my head over.''</p>
        <p>According to the police, Casey and a friend, Desmond Miller, beat Hoboken Police Officer Frank Fitzsimmons, at about 2:30 a.m. The police chief, Carmen LaBruno, said Fitzsimmons, who is white, was with a black woman. When they encountered Casey and two other black men, the police said, the woman was asked: ''What are you doing with him? You should be with us. You're one of us.'' Another man with Casey, his cousin Keeon Walker, a tailback at Syracuse, was not charged by the police but was later named along with Casey and Miller in a lawsuit filed by Fitzsimmons.</p>
        <p>The police said Fitzsimmons was unconscious after being kicked in the head and that Casey had bloodstained boots. Casey and Miller have pleaded not guilty. Conviction could result in five years in prison. Anthony Pope, a lawyer representing the police officer in the civil suit, said today that Fitzsimmons has not returned to work since the incident and still has problems with his face and his jaw as well as psychological trauma. A call to Casey's lawyer, Dennis McAlevy, was not returned.</p>
        <p>Casey, who shared the quarterback job with Kevin Thompson last season, is expected this season to lead the Nittany Lions, who finished last season at 10-3. Penn State opens its 12-game, regular-season schedule on Aug. 27 against U.S.C. in the Kickoff Classic at Giants Stadium. Paterno, beginning his 35th season as Penn State head coach, needs seven victories to surpass Bear Bryant, whose 323 victories are the most in  N.C.A.A. history for a Division I university.</p>
        <p>Today, Paterno outlined ground rules for reporters interviewing his quarterback. ''As long as you talk about football, that's fine,'' Paterno said. ''Legitimate football questions, he'll certainly be available.'' But, Paterno said, ''I've told him it's ridiculous to get into a long discussion'' about matters outside football.</p>
        <p>''You guys are all looking for just one answer that's going to give you a headline,'' Paterno told about 200 journalists who gathered in the auditorium of the football complex. He also emphasized that Casey would be a starter, something he would not guarantee for other players.</p>
        <p>''I don't have anyone penciled in to start except Casey right now,'' Paterno said.</p>
        <p>When asked whether he was surprised or gratified that Paterno is backing him in this way, Casey said, ''No.'' Did he expect it? ''Yep,'' Casey said.</p>
        <p>Reflecting on the aftermath of the May incident, Casey said: ''People say things about you and don't even know you. You've got to learn to deal with it. Like my mother said, 'What don't kill you makes you stronger.'</p>
        <p>''Right now, nothing anybody can say about me or do toward me can change what I've got to do on the field.''</p>
