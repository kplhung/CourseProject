        <p>WEST HARTFORD, virtually equidistant between Boston and New York, has long capitalized on its proximity to more live culture than a lifetime supply of yogurt. Now, with construction under way on the Park Road Playhouse, the town is about to gain the first live theater of its 146-year-old history.</p>
        <p>''It's long overdue, and I think we have the infrastructure and the demographics to support it,'' said the town's mayor, Rob Bouvier. ''West Hartford has had a longstanding tradition of embracing and supporting the arts.''</p>
        <p>The theater, scheduled to open next winter, has already gained support. More than $375,000 of its $500,000 budget has been raised, including a $200,000 grant from the Connecticut Commission on the Arts, $100,000 from the State Office of Policy and Management and $27,000 from the town's community development fund. An additional $50,000 has come from individuals.</p>
        <p>''But the support, I think, is even above and beyond dollars and cents,'' said Barry Feldman, the town manager who is so enthusiastic that he submitted himself to public ridicule last spring at a roast to benefit the project. ''That's evidenced on almost a daily basis,'' Mr. Feldman said, ''by hundreds if not thousands of volunteer hours, from people who serve on the board of the theater to interested residents who donate their time to help do some demolition work in the building in which the theater is going to ultimately be housed.''</p>
        <p>That building is the former A. C. Petersen Farms dairy on Park Road, a terra cotta structure adjoining a 1939 Art Deco ice cream parlor still popular for its sundaes topped with hand-whipped heavy cream. In a garage where 48 milk trucks once revved up for their rounds, the curtain will soon rise on a theater in the round.</p>
        <p>Mr. Feldman and other community leaders hope that the playhouse will be a kind of catalyst for development along the avenue, where $5 million has just been spent on improvements such as lighting and paving as well as burying power lines under a completely rebuilt roadway.</p>
        <p>''This is something that's going to be very important in the future of West Hartford,'' said Rob Rowlson, who is in charge of business development for the town. ''I think from this other things will grow, such as opportunities for artists in residence who will come here, do work and perform and expose our community to creative efforts we don't normally see otherwise.''</p>
        <p>''This thing could spiral,'' said Angelo Faenza, a restaurateur and president of the Park Road Merchants Association, noting that ''when I first got involved in it, I had artists from Bridgeport and New Haven call me wondering if there would be studio space available for them in the building.'' Mr. Faenza said he thought that a busy theater might attract new businesses such as restaurants and boutiques, as well as generate other attractions. ''Once you have the staging and the lights set,'' he said, ''and you get a marquee out there, this place could be used every night, whether it be for a comedy show or jazz.''</p>
        <p>No one is as eager for the playhouse to open as its artistic director. The venture may be a major first for the town, yet for Howard Hirsch it is very much part of a second chance.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hirsch, a 63-year-old advertising executive, once aspired to a life in the theater. But that ambition was overridden by the need to feed a growing family. Although he remained active in local theater (as artistic director of the Mark Twain Masquers), his dream of running a theater was relegated to the list of things he hoped to do someday. That changed abruptly five years ago when Mr. Hirsch said he ''woke up and realized I'd almost run out of somedays.'' Mr. Hirsch had entered the hospital for an angioplasty, but there were complications and he was put on a list for a heart transplant. The doctors summoned his family; that's when they got word that a heart suitable for transplant had been found. And Mr. Hirsch said he knew just what to do with his revival.</p>
        <p>Virginia Woolf once said a writer needs a room of her own. For a community theater troupe to thrive, Mr. Hirsch said, it too needs a permanent space.</p>
        <p>''It's terribly important from an economic standpoint,'' he explained. ''If you have your own theater, the lights, seats, working space and sound equipment are all installed. If you're performing at a school, church or other borrowed facility, you have to rent all those things and pay a crew to install them. That can cause production costs to double.''</p>
        <p>Having space to call home, he said, is also essential in attracting a faithful audience. ''People like to feel comfortable knowing where they're going,'' he said. ''Imagine if you subscribed to a six-show season, and each time you had to find a new place.''</p>
        <p>When a company has its own stage, the audience arrives with a different attitude. ''They walk in expecting more, a higher level of both performance and production,'' he said. ''It allows the company to reach higher. You can choose subject matter and plays that are more thoughtful and far-reaching.''</p>
        <p>That is what Mr. Hirsch hopes to do on Park Road. ''I've worked in community theater now for about 40 years,'' he said, ''and the reason I want to start my own theater company is to stretch further and to do plays that, while entertaining and exciting, can also be thought-provoking and informative.''</p>
        <p>The first season is expected to include ''The Real Thing,'' by Tom Stoppard, and Arthur Miller's work ''The Price.'' He considers each one ideal for the space, which will have just 168 seats.</p>
        <p>Park Road, of course, is way off Broadway. It isn't even Main Street. This will indeed be community theater, although Mr. Hirsch said that doesn't mean acting that is amateurish.</p>
        <p>''When I had my ad agency, I used to go into New York to cast commercials. You'd have a cattle call, and who came? People from Albuquerque, Buffalo and Hartford. They'd been in the city for 60 days, signed with an agent and suddenly they were 'New York talent.' It didn't take me long to realize that talent is all over the place. You find it in every walk of life -- doctors, teachers, salespeople, postmen, housewives, plumbers.''</p>
        <p>The organization's directors, by design, also come from other fields. ''This theater had to have a business sense,'' he said, ''as well as an artistic one.''</p>
        <p>Among the board members he recruited are business owners, community leaders, engineers and academicians.</p>
        <p>''When you have theater people on a board,'' Mr. Hirsch said, ''their primary concerns are which plays are you doing that I like, which ones have parts for me, and which have parts for my friends.''</p>
        <p>One of Mr. Hirsch's most ardent volunteers is Plato Karafelis, the principal of an elementary school, who became involved on the condition that the playhouse have an educational component.</p>
        <p>Mr. Karafelis said he would like the theater to offer children's plays performed by adults, as well as scripts written and performed by children, student playwriting contests, poetry slams and excursions to Broadway shows.</p>
        <p>''There is no comprehensive children's theater program here,'' said Mr. Karafelis, ''and boy, if there's a town that's ripe for it, that would be West Hartford.''</p>
        <p>It is an idea that Mr. Hirsch readily embraces.</p>
        <p>''Most kids have no idea what live theater is about,'' he said, and with television, movies, CD's and the Internet, ''theater is in competition for the young mind, and it's a battle it could actually lose.''</p>
