        <p>IT wasn't as if Ann-Marie Saccurato was out of shape. At 23 she is a personal trainer who teaches kick boxing and spinning at the New York Sports Club in White Plains.</p>
        <p>Still, her friend Nick Delury was concerned when she told him she had signed up to compete in the state Golden Gloves tournament. ''Where have you been boxing?'' he asked her.</p>
        <p>''Nowhere,'' she answered.</p>
        <p>''You shouldn't be going,'' said Mr. Delury, who owns the Boxing Connection, a boxing and fitness center here. ''You could get hurt.''</p>
        <p>''No, I'm going,'' Ms. Saccurato insisted. Mr. Delury offered to train her.</p>
        <p>Five months later, Ms. Saccurato is a member of the Women's National Boxing Team, and she came in second in the New York State Golden Gloves finals in April at Madison Square Garden in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Now she is training to compete in the National Golden Gloves Tournament this month in Augusta, Ga., as well as a match against Russia in November.</p>
        <p>''I'm a warrior,'' she said recently at the Boxing Connection here, where she trains in the ring with sparring partners and works out on the punching bags for two to three hours every afternoon.</p>
        <p>Besides her work as a fitness instructor, which pays for her training, she follows a strict conditioning and running program. Her friends call her crazy, she said, but support her.</p>
        <p>''She's a powerhouse, so loving and giving, and I am so proud of her,'' said Stephanie Saccurato, Ms. Saccurato's mother who lives in Yorktown Heights with Ms. Saccurato's 19-year-old brother. ''When she was in nursery school,'' her mother recalled, ''her teacher suggested that I get her a jungle gym for her excess energy.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Saccurato lives in Eastchester with her maternal grandparents to be closer to the gym, she said. Although they don't quite grasp the idea of women's boxing, her grandparents are happy for her, Ms. Saccurato said.</p>
        <p>She tells of a difficult childhood in Eastchester, a home where violence was common. ''My father was abusive, and cops coming into my house was a regular occurrence,'' she said, adding, ''He's gone, I don't care where. It's just made me stronger.''</p>
        <p>An athlete since childhood, she attended Tuckahoe High School where she played basketball, volleyball and softball.</p>
        <p>One of the many tattoos on her muscular body is the head of a wolf, which covers her upper back. ''It represents courage,'' she said.</p>
        <p>In August 1995 after graduating from high school she was so badly hurt in a car crash that doctors gave her very little chance of survival. After 14 hours of surgery to repair broken bones in her legs, ribs and pelvis, her first words to the doctors were, ''What about sports?'' They said, ''We'll see.'' She said: ''Yes, you'll see. You'll see me out there.''</p>
        <p>After three months in the hospital and three months of rehabilitation she started working out again and working as a personal trainer. She enrolled in Seton Hall University to study health and physical fitness but left after one year to pursue her career in the fitness industry.</p>
        <p>The Boxing Connection, Ms. Saccurato's ''home away from home'' attracts professional and amateur boxers as well people who come to learn the basic moves of noncontact boxing and undergo an intense workout. The rat-tat-tat of men and women punching the bags mingled with the rock music in the background as Ms. Saccurato prepared to spar with Ernesto Dallas, 31, a business consultant.</p>
        <p>Mr. Delury leaned on the ropes outside the ring and started coaching the pair, both wearing mandatory headgear. ''Firm hands, firm hands,'' he said. ''Don't let him deflect that jab. Firm jab.'' She got hit. She stopped for barely a second and said, ''Let's go.'' Mr. Delury continued. ''O.K., now double jab, straight left, right hook. Circle to your right. Keep away from his power.'' He explained later that this was a combination for a southpaw.</p>
        <p>Another of her trainers, Maurice (Kid Sharkey) Sposato, 83, a coach who has trained top professional contenders, laughing, said: ''Ann-Marie? I don't even want to fight her, that's how tough she is. But she's a good-natured girl.''</p>
        <p>She spars with men to learn how to take a hard punch and handle different situations. ''Just another boxer,'' she said. ''That's how I look at a male sparring partner.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Delury establishes her schedule for road work, conditioning and  boxing basics, as well as nutritional counseling. ''Nick did a remarkable job with me in two months,'' she said.</p>
        <p>While her training readies her for battle, boxing is not about sending your opponent off on a stretcher, she said.</p>
        <p>''The intention is not to be barbaric,'' she said. ''It's a competition, like a physical chess game. But when I step into the ring as an athlete I'm a pit bull. I am going after you.''</p>
        <p>In Ms. Saccurato's first fight she took a punch that broke her nose. In Texas a week later she took a punch to the nose and started bleeding. ''I had to prove to the doctors and staff that I could go on,'' she said. ''I did it by staying aggressive in the ring. They pulled me aside and saw I was fine.''</p>
        <p>Why boxing?</p>
        <p>''It's the ultimate challenge you can put yourself through,'' she said. ''What other sport are you one on one with somebody full force who wants to take your head off? You focus and go. It's poetry in motion.''</p>
        <p>She would like to bring back a gold medal in women's boxing from the 2004 Olympics, turn professional and be where Muhammad Ali's daughter, Leila Ali, a professional boxer, is now, she said.</p>
        <p>Johnnie Woluewich, vice president of U.S.A. Boxing Metro, said in a phone conversation: ''Ann-Marie has come along faster than normal. She's national caliber now.''</p>
        <p>Upon hearing this, Ms. Saccurato said, ''I'm a warrior with a lot of work to do.''</p>
