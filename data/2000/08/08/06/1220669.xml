        <p>A shortage of pilots forced United Airlines to cancel 16 percent of its flights at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago yesterday, creating a wave of delays across the country that inconvenienced thousands of passengers.</p>
        <p>The cancellations, involving 156 flights, created one of the more serious disruptions in service since April, when United's contract with its 10,000 pilots expired and many refused to fly overtime in protest.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's difficulties were particularly surprising because United had already reduced its schedule of flights by more than 2 percent to ensure that it would have enough pilots.</p>
        <p>A United spokesman, Chris Brathwaite, blamed much of the problem on the weather. Heavy rains and thunderstorms over the last week had caused delays across the country, Mr. Brathwaite said, forcing many pilots to use up the hours they are legally allowed to be on the job and leading to yesterday's crew shortages.</p>
        <p>''It's kind of a domino effect,'' he  said. ''We are doing as much as we have control over to make sure that people get the kind of service that they expect.''</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Associations could not be reached yesterday, but in the past, the union has said that it is not involved in any concerted job action, which would be illegal under federal law.</p>
        <p>Individual pilots have said in interviews that there is an unspoken agreement among many of their peers not to volunteer for overtime.</p>
        <p>O'Hare is United's biggest hub, so the disruption there rippled through the system.</p>
        <p>Linda Carter, a psychologist and textbook editor in Pagosa Springs, Colo., was trying to fly to Washington, D.C., to escape the wildfires in her state.</p>
        <p>Ms. Carter got as far as Chicago only to find that her flight to Washington had been canceled.</p>
        <p>''I'm plenty frustrated,'' she said, standing at the end of a long customer service line. ''I may just go get a hotel because I'm tired and hungry.''</p>
        <p>Although United pared its schedule by 4,800 flights between May and August, and it has taken nearly 2,000 more flights out of the September schedule, there may be additional reductions, Mr. Brathwaite said.</p>
        <p>He also said there would probably be more delays today. He recommended that passengers call ahead, check United's Web site and ''exercise patience.''</p>
        <p>Full planes and severe thunderstorms have strained the country's air traffic control system, leading to record numbers of delays this summer. But United, the world's largest carrier, has been hurt far worse than others. Its flights arrived on time only 57 percent of the time in May, the last month for which statistics are available, and it has had a record number of cancellations.</p>
        <p>In addition to its pilots, United is negotiating a new contract with its mechanics, baggage handlers and gate agents, who are represented by the International Association of Machinists. The machinists and the pilots took deep wage cuts in 1994 in exchange for a majority of the stock in UAL Corporation, United's parent.</p>
        <p>At the time, the airline was struggling, but it has since recorded several years of record profits. Both unions said their members were promised generous contracts when the old ones expired. They accused UAL management of going back on its word.</p>
        <p>United executives have said they are committed to reaching an ''industry-leading'' contract with the pilots and the machinists.</p>
