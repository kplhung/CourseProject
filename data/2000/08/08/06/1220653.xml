        <p>One woman was attacked last spring in Central Park by two strangers who beat and sexually abused her until she broke free and ran to safety on Manhattan's West Side. The attackers were convicted of aggravated sexual abuse and are serving long prison terms.</p>
        <p>Another woman was attacked last summer by a man who dragged her under the Coney Island Boardwalk, where, according to her grand jury testimony, he punched her and raped her and told her that ''he was going to put me six feet under.'' This assailant, a serial sex offender, secured a lenient plea bargain for attempted assault. He will be eligible for a parole hearing in January.</p>
        <p>The drastically different outcomes of these similar cases were the result of what prosecutors, physicians and victims' advocates describe as a game of chance inside emergency rooms at New York City hospitals. The first woman received a thorough examination that documented evidence of the attack. The second woman did not.</p>
        <p>Years after forensic exams became a standard part of treatment for victims of sex crimes, the level of competence in administering the exams varies widely. Some victims get meticulous treatment. Many do not. This uneven quality of care, experts say, can mean an uneven quality of evidence with which to prosecute some of society's most malevolent criminals.</p>
        <p>''It's kind of a crap shoot,'' said John Albert, a director at Safe Horizon, an organization that assists crime victims in the five boroughs. ''Depending on which hospital treats you, you can either get care that is excellent, or you can get care that is delinquent.''</p>
        <p>Next month, Gov. George E. Pataki plans to sign into law the Sexual Assault Reform Act, which includes a provision directing the Department of Health to develop more rape treatment programs like the one at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, which treated the victim of the Central Park attack.</p>
        <p>This treatment model, known as a sexual assault examiner program,  provides every victim with immediate care, a private examination area and a nurse or a doctor with special training in forensic exams. It also encourages examiners to serve as witnesses before grand juries and in trials, giving prosecutors leverage when negotiating plea agreements with defendants.</p>
        <p>Only a handful of these programs exist in the 73 hospitals with emergency rooms in New York City, handling a small fraction of the 2,000 to 2,800 rapes reported in the city each year. Nationally, about 300 of these centers are in service, treating as few as 2 percent of sex crime patients in the country each year, though experts say the programs have been expanding each year since their inception in the mid-1970's.</p>
        <p>The precise plans for expanding the programs in New York, and for paying for them, have not yet been made, state health officials say. But Mr. Pataki and victims' advocates say the act gives New York a chance to create a network of sophisticated treatment centers throughout the city, bringing a measure of parity to the care and attention that victims of sex crimes receive.</p>
        <p>''Right now, emergency rooms too often lack the forensic expertise to  collect the evidence needed to convict sexual predators,'' Mr. Pataki  said. ''The advocates have been advocating, and we think they are right, that we need to have three of these special centers in each borough. Through the State Department of Health, we are going to work with them to make that happen.''</p>
        <p>Since 1991, state health law has required emergency rooms to examine survivors of sex crimes with rape kits -- a box of equipment and sampling envelopes that standardizes the collection of evidence -- approved by the state. But these exams are sometimes undermined, experts say, by tensions between the medical needs in emergency departments and the legal needs of the authorities.</p>
        <p>The potential problems are many. Prosecutors and victims' advocates tell of patients who have been subjected to long waits in public seating areas, of untrained examiners botching the exams and of physicians who have turned over evidence to the police but have refused to cooperate further. ''I've had nightmare examples,'' said Linda Fairstein, chief of the Manhattan sex crimes bureau.</p>
        <p>To offset these problems, sexual assault examiner programs rely on cadres of nurses, midwives and doctors who are trained in finding, handling and documenting forensic evidence. The examiners then volunteer to be on call, reporting to emergency rooms to perform the exams whenever a victim arrives.</p>
        <p>''Our examiners are only allowed to treat rape patients on their days off,'' said Karen Reichert, the program's coordinator. ''The idea is that when you are examining a rape patient, you have no other duties and no other priorities, so all of your attention goes to the victim.''</p>
        <p>The programs also provide victims with trained advocates who stay with patients throughout each hospital visit and provide counseling.</p>
        <p>Hospitals and their representatives say that many emergency departments without specially trained, on-call examiners can still provide effective treatment, and that the overwhelming number of patients receive competent exams.</p>
        <p>''People are incredibly compassionate and they really want to treat people in the right and appropriate ways,'' said Mary Johnson, spokeswoman for Greater New York Hospital Association, which represents 100 area hospitals.</p>
        <p>But the Boardwalk case, which was cited when state regulators fined Coney Island Hospital $46,000 last month, illustrates that when a hospital is unprepared, or protocols are not followed, the quality of care can sink by a baffling degree.</p>
        <p>The Department of Health's investigation found that the hospital made the woman wait three hours for the exam and then lost her underwear and vaginal swabs. It also found the hospital bungled two tests for sexually transmitted diseases, did not ensure she received a full birth-control prescription and failed to provide complete care from social workers.</p>
        <p>The authorities said that if the evidence had not been lost it might have been used to secure a rape conviction against Anthony Jones, a serial sex offender who attacked the woman the day after his release  from prison. Instead, prosecutors dropped a rape count in exchange for Mr. Jones's guilty plea to the comparatively minor offense. He was sentenced to two to four years.</p>
        <p>The handling of the Boardwalk case stands in sharp contrast to the treatment of the woman attacked in Central Park, who released her medical records to The New York Times on the condition that her name and the names of her attackers not be published.</p>
        <p>In this case, the victim arrived at the hospital at 8:05 a.m. and was  immediately led to a private examining room, where a physician performed an initial assessment within 10 minutes. A social worker arrived within 25 minutes. The examiner, Dr. Lorraine Giordano, was at the victim's side by 9 a.m., having been paged to work from home.</p>
        <p>Unlike the emergency departments in almost all hospitals, the rape treatment center at St. Luke's-Roosevelt is equipped with a video camera with a magnifying lens called a colposcope, as well as a Wood's lamp, which illuminates a victim with a purplish-blue glow, allowing examiners to find drops or smudges of an attacker's body fluids that can be swabbed and analyzed for DNA. These two pieces of specialized equipment let examiners search  victims for evidence that can prove an attack occurred and, in some cases, they can link a suspect to the crime.</p>
        <p>In the Central Park case, the assault was cut short when the victim's dog bit one of the attackers, allowing her to escape. The attackers left behind no DNA. But with the colposcope, Dr. Giordano was able to find and photograph genital abrasions that were consistent with sexual abuse, supporting the prosecutor's charge.</p>
        <p>One law enforcement authority said that after one of the defendants was confronted with the contents of the medical file -- which included images detailing the injuries -- he pleaded guilty to the maximum charge and accepted a 15-year prison sentence. Until that point, he had denied any sexual abuse had occurred.</p>
        <p>How often sex crime victims receive this level of treatment is not clear; prosecutors and hospitals say statistics have not been compiled in New York. Dr. Linda Ledray, of Minneapolis, who has studied the programs for the federal Department of Justice, said a study in the Midwest found that prosecutors introduced 48 percent more evidence in cases in which victims were treated in examiner programs.</p>
        <p>The study's contention supports local prosecutors' anecdotes about high quality evidence gathered from the examiners' work. ''The injuries these examiners identify can turn cases from a he-said-she-said case into cases of rape,'' said Marjory Fisher, chief of the special victims bureau in Queens.</p>
        <p>In New York, prosecutors complain only that the programs do not handle enough of the caseload. In Brooklyn, for example, the only forensic examiner program is at Long Island College Hospital in Cobble Hill. It treated 66 of 823 rape cases in the borough last year. ''The program is great,'' said Julie Schwartz, deputy chief of the Brooklyn sex crimes bureau. ''We just can't get as many cases into it as we would like.''</p>
        <p>The Sexual Assault Reform Act requires the state to start additional programs during 2001 and to develop standards for supervising them. John Signor, a spokesman for the Department of Health, said the department was working with hospitals to determine which emergency rooms would become part of the proposed network.</p>
        <p>Many issues remain unresolved, including finding a formula for underwriting the training and logistics required to develop new programs, and addressing the concerns of ambulance services about tying up crews on longer drives if they are required to bring all sex crime victims to the designated centers.</p>
        <p>''We're really trying to figure out how to do this,'' said Harriet Lessel, executive director of the New York City Alliance Against Sexual Assault, which lobbied for the passage of the act and is now assisting the Department of Health. ''All hospitals cannot start or maintain these programs. They are very complex.''</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, hospital representatives and state health officials say that some hospitals have expressed a willingness to take part. State health officials and the governor would not discuss estimates of the cost, but Mr. Pataki said he expected that the administration would provide some of the money to expand the centers.</p>
        <p>''Sex predators are very often serial predators, and if we can catch them and stop them after the first attack, we can prevent them from having more victims,'' the governor said. ''You can't put a price on that.''</p>
