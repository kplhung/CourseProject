        <p>In 1964, a chemical spill in the basement of St. Albans Naval Hospital's nuclear medicine laboratory  left traces of radioactive contamination.</p>
        <p>Now, more than 35 years later, a full cleanup is planned, and on Aug. 21, federal agencies are to begin removing more than 60 cubic yards of material that contains strontium-90, a radioactive isotope sometimes used to treat cancerous eye conditions.</p>
        <p>If ingested, strontium-90 can lead to bone cancer, said officials of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, one of the agencies supervising the cleanup.</p>
        <p>Residents of the St. Albans neighborhood and employees of the 231-bed hospital, known since 1974 as the St. Albans Veterans Administration Extended Care Center, have been told by the agencies that the contamination is minimal and poses no danger.</p>
        <p>But not everyone is satisfied with those assurances.</p>
        <p>''We're very nervous, very unhappy,'' said Sadie Westbrook, president of the St. Albans Improvement Association, a neighborhood group. ''The community wasn't properly notified.  They can downplay it all they want, but how do we know what damage has been done in 35 years?''</p>
        <p>The spill occurred when strontium-90 boiled over a beaker, seeping through the tiles into the laboratory's concrete floors, John Mazzulla, a hospital spokesman, said.</p>
        <p>The Navy believed that a cleanup done the same year was sufficient,  he said. But the strontium-90 got into the concrete, which is what must now be removed.</p>
        <p>The basement was sealed for many years and has never been used by the Veterans Administration, now known as the Department of Veterans Affairs, Mr. Mazzulla said.</p>
        <p>The spill was all but forgotten until 1992, when the Army Corps of Engineers reviewed it in a survey of former military sites and detected contamination.</p>
        <p>Ronald Bellamy, the branch chief for the regulatory commission, said that although the amount of radioactive material posed no threat, rules mandated a cleanup. But the job was given such a low priority that six years passed before planning began.</p>
        <p>The Corps of Engineers acknowledged that notification to residents, made in April, should have come earlier to assuage fears, but said it was not legally required because of the low level of risk.</p>
        <p>The corps said that if the contaminated concrete were powdered and inhaled, a person would absorb about 325 millirems of radiation, 20 to 30 times more than that of an X-ray but within the range of the amount absorbed over a year from background radiation.</p>
        <p>The corps manager for the project, Luz Labato, said soil and water tests showed no indication that the waste posed any threat to the environment or had infiltrated ground water. Some St. Albans residents get their drinking water from a combination of well water and upstate reservoirs.</p>
        <p>The cleanup is scheduled to take  about a month, Ms. Labato said, and should cost $800,000 to $950,000, though the commission said the job could take longer. The area will be sealed off, and the radioactive material decontaminated, placed in drums and hauled off.</p>
        <p>''I'm hoping everything will be done in a safe manner,'' Ms. Westbrook said. ''All I can do is hope.''</p>
