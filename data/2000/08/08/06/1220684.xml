        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>I was one of those baseball fans who argued that agents weren't ruining baseball and that players had a right to make as much money as they could negotiate. After all, their careers are relatively short and very few can make a living on who they used to be once their playing days are through.</p>
        <p>That was before the Orioles were shipped out of town en masse last week.</p>

        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>I was one of those baseball fans who argued that agents weren't ruining baseball and that players had a right to make as much money as they could negotiate. After all, their careers are relatively short and very few can make a living on who they used to be once their playing days are through.</p>
        <p>That was before the Orioles were shipped out of town en masse last week.</p>
        <p>I am happy that B. J. Surhoff, Charles Johnson, Mike Bordick and Will Clark all have a shot at going to the World Series this year. God knows they've earned it. No, the Orioles haven't been a serious title threat in the last few years, but you would have never guessed it by the way they always played their hearts out. And you would never have guessed it judging by the enthusiasm of the ever-present large crowds at Camden Yards. The Orioles have always had a tradition of playing hard, and Oriole fans have always had a tradition of enthusiastically supporting the team.</p>
        <p>I know it's unrealistic to expect that any player should remain in one city for the duration of his career, but it's so sad to show up at the Yard and not know for sure who's still in an O's uniform and who's on a jet on his way to Atlanta, Chicago, New York or St. Louis. I've been an O's fan since I was a little girl. I knew that Boog, Frank, Brooks, Eddie and Elrod were going to be there every time I entered Memorial Stadium (my dad holding my one hand, my grandfather holding the other). I miss those days.</p>
