        <p>In pop music, there's an old argument about whether music exists to give words meaning or whether it's the other way around. Ideally, music and vocals should carry as much weight as lyrics. It's not just the accumulation of indelible poetic images that give Bob Dylan's ''Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall'' its force (the song could be a missing Old Testament prophecy) but the fear and awe and perseverance in Dylan's hoarse vocal and the way the simple tune keeps repeating, as if the singer were on a road that offered no exit. But in theory at least, songwriting seems to offer good practice for writing short stories. Some of our best popular songwriters -- Bruce Springsteen, John Prine, Iris DeMent and Neil Tennant of Pet Shop Boys all come to mind -- winnow their tales down to the essentials without skimping on emotion.</p>
        <p>Now, two veteran British songwriters, Graham Parker and Ray Davies, the founder of the Kinks, have decided to have a go with words alone in their new books of short stories.</p>
        <p>Parker emerged in 1976 with a pair of albums, ''Howlin' Wind'' and ''Heat Treatment,'' that transmuted hard-edged soul music into bitter, blasted expressions of romance and resentment. And yet the music wasn't without hope. On perhaps his finest song, ''Fool's Gold,'' Parker sang about defying every disillusionment life put in his way, until the song reached a majestic peak. It was a young man's song, but a song from a young man who had already been forced to acknowledge -- but not concede to -- defeat as a fact of life.</p>
        <p>There's not a story in Parker's first book, ''Carp Fishing on Valium,'' that I wouldn't trade for ''Fool's Gold'' or any of his best songs. Progressing from the naturalistic to the surreal, the book follows the life of Brian Porker from schoolboy to teenage mod to harried young married to punk rocker to journeyman music veteran to stand-up comic. It's this final incarnation that hints at the self-loathing that runs beneath the book's surface.</p>
        <p>''Carp Fishing on Valium'' begins with a story in which the young Brian faces the sadism of his hobby of collecting bird eggs. The concluding story reaches its climax with a heavy-handed bit of symbolism in which the grown and disillusioned Brian watches a woodcock nearly become the prey of a peregrine falcon. We are meant to see that Brian himself has become prey to the vultures lying in wait in his chosen line of work.</p>
        <p>What's in between recycles both the iconography of the English teenage 60's (Brian's mod clothes, Lambrettas) and the cliches of rock-star excess. Parker isn't so self-pitying that he doesn't manage some catty swipes at rock-star royalty, from Cliff Richard to Chrissie Hynde. His writing style feels just as cliched: the first two naturalistic stories offer trite lessons about childish capacity for cruelty; the fanciful stories that follow trade in wan, hallucinatory black humor. I finished the book thinking that the man who sang ''Fool's Gold'' could do better than this morass of self-pity and curdled fancy.</p>
        <p>The travails of rock-star life take up the first half of Ray Davies's ''Waterloo Sunset.'' Davies has seen enough ups and downs, both with the Kinks and as a solo artist, to record those peaks and valleys with distanced mordancy. He clearly intends the book's central figure, the aging rock star Les Mulligan, to be a stand-in for himself. It's a rather sad choice for an autobiographical figure. Living on his past glory, Les is an aging casualty, drying up as a writer but knowing no other way to live. Along with the anger about being discarded by the music industry, there is a sense that Davies sees himself as deserving of the fate. Les feels like a shadow of his reputation.</p>
        <p>Davies himself has little to apologize for. The peak of his writing, on the late-60's albums ''Something Else by the Kinks'' and ''(The Kinks Are) the Village Green Preservation Society,'' turned its back on fashionable swinging London for the less stylish locales of suburban tea shops and parlors where the faded furnishings matched faded lives. It remains an unusual subject for rock 'n' roll -- the desperate propriety of failed lives.</p>
        <p>''Waterloo Sunset'' takes its title from Davies's most beautiful song. Many of the stories take their titles from other Davies songs and even end with the song's lyrics. At its best, ''Waterloo Sunset'' is suffused with the same sharp compassion that distinguished Davies's songwriting. In ''Rock-and-Roll-Fantasy'' a young man whose entire life is wrapped up in music slowly fades into the margins of his already marginal existence. The retired couple in ''Voices in the Dark'' are the characters Davies does best, aging people trying to hang on to the comforts they've spent their lives striving toward. In ''Art Lover,'' an atmospheric elegy for a love affair in which ardor is inseparable from self-destruction, Les is involved with a volatile young woman on the fringes of London's rock scene.</p>
        <p>''Donna looked at herself in the broken mirror in the living room. Her blond hair was lank and matted. She found some scissors and started hacking it off close to her scalp. When Les walked in and saw the pile of hair on the floor, he smiled as if to approve.</p>
        <p>'' 'Looks brilliant. Like Joan of Arc, with attitude.'</p>
        <p>''Les picked up the scissors and hacked some of his own hair and mingled it with Donna's as a token. Then they made love on the mattress in the bedroom.''</p>
        <p>The problem is that in expanding the characters from his life and his songs into these stories, Davies does not necessarily make them more vivid. The nameless man in the song ''Waterloo Sunset,'' watching young lovers from the loneliness of his dank room, is more vivid and pitiable than the con artist who steps into his shoes here. ''Waterloo Sunset'' is not a negligible book, but it's a superfluous one. Davies's characters seem to be waiting for the music that will bring them to life.</p>
