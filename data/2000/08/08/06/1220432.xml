        <p>Less than a decade ago, a section of waterfront here known as Harsimus Cove, a 40-acre expanse of trucked-in sand, lay like a bizarre, man-made Sahara amid the skyscrapers that had risen in the 1980's.</p>
        <p>But high-rise buildings have been sprouting like dune grass in Harsimus Cove in recent years, as well as along other formerly barren stretches of Hudson River in Hoboken as well as here, irrigated by economic good times and the urge to be a PATH stop from Manhattan. Farther north along what is called the Gold Coast, town houses and condominium clusters are mushrooming at the base of the Palisades.</p>
        <p>While the growth has generally been applauded by state and local officials, it has also increased the burden on firefighters, who say high-rise fires are labor intensive and demand knowledge of a building's intricate electrical and ventilation systems. They can also involve large numbers of residents with limited routes of escape.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, any high-rise fire, depending on the type of fire that you have, is going to tax anybody's department,'' said Chief Frederick G. Eggers of the Jersey City Fire Department. ''We had a certain amount of high rises up until this point, but ever since the Gold Coast has taken off, they're popping up every day.''</p>
        <p>Officially, high rises are buildings seven stories or higher. In the past 10 years, 20 of them have gone up here -- most on or near the waterfront -- for a total of about 120 buildings, officials say. Eight more are under construction, and more are planned.</p>
        <p>Hoboken, a much smaller city, has about 40 high-rise buildings, officials there say, with construction at a similarly brisk pace. As a result, fire departments in the region have been designing training and prevention programs, seeking more firefighters with the tax revenue generated by the new buildings, and even planning new fire houses financed by developers.</p>
        <p>Moreover, a plan is being developed by the fire director here, Armando Roman, who is also on the State Fire Safety Commission, requiring that high-rise buildings have fire personnel on duty around the clock.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roman said that in a fire's crucial early stages, the managers could use a building's intercom system to communicate with residents and help firefighters by shutting down the power and turning off the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning, which can spread smoke and fire.</p>
        <p>Officials said that is what happened last month in a new 26-story apartment building in the Harsimus Cove section, where four people suffered smoke inhalation. ''At that particular fire, had there been a fire manager, that person could have gotten on the P.A. system and as soon as he assessed the situation, could have told people, 'There's no need to evacuate the building, stay in your apartment,' '' Mr. Roman said.</p>
        <p>William Kramer, deputy director of the State Division of Fire Safety, said Mr. Roman's proposal would be the first such measure mandating safety managers. Mr. Kramer declined to comment on the proposal, which Mr Roman said he might offer at the next commission meeting Sept. 13.</p>
        <p>Tom Gallagher, chief of staff for Mayor Bret Schundler, said Mr. Roman had briefly discussed the proposal, although the mayor had not decided whether to support it.</p>
        <p>For now, state law requires that fire safety managers be on duty in Atlantic City casinos. In New York City, such personnel must be stationed in high-rise office buildings, whose wide floors make them more vulnerable to the rapid spread of fire.</p>
        <p>At least one of Mr. Roman's fellow commissioners, Deputy Chief Richard Blohm of the Hoboken Fire Department, said he would support such a requirement, which -- if recommended by the commission -- would have to be approved either as legislation or as a regulation of the State Department of Community Affairs, which includes the Division of Fire Safety.</p>
        <p>But the necessity, cost effectiveness and  the potential benefit of requiring fire safety managers are far from certain. Deputy Chief Blohm said last month that he had begun surveying high rises and would then develop plans for each building.</p>
        <p>Aside from last month's fire, in which no one was seriously injured, firefighters said they could not recall a major high-rise fire along the waterfront in recent years. But even supporters of such a requirement acknowledged that it would probably be opposed by most developers. Joseph Barry, president of the Applied Companies of Hoboken, which operates several high-rise builings there and in Jersey City, said the annual price tag could come to as much as $250,000 a building, a cost that would ultimately be passed on to tenants. In a building of 250 apartments, that would amount to $1,000 a year for each tenant, or $84 a month added to the rent.</p>
        <p>''It's a very big burden,'' said Mr. Barry, who suggested that the money could be better spent elsewhere.</p>
        <p>But Ed Cortese, a vice president for the Lefrak Organization, which has a dozen high-rise office and apartment buildings in its Newport complex, said the company already had the equivalent of round-the-clock fire safety managers. ''We think it is an excellent idea,'' Mr. Cortese said.</p>
