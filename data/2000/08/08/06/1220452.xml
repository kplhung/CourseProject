        <p>EVEN the parking lot hints that this is not the regular New Jersey.</p>
        <p>''Give Blood, Ride Bulls,'' ''Chicks Dig Scars'' and ''Forget the Whales, Save the Cowboys,'' read the bumper stickers.</p>
        <p>Among the pickups and the horse vans, there is a distinct chorus of ''Mooooooooo! Moooooooo!'' in the not-too-far-off distance.</p>
        <p>This is a Cowtown Saturday night, a country celebration of the longest continuous weekly rodeo in the United States. Every Saturday night at 7:30 from May through September, the stands at Cowtown fill up, just like they have since 1955.</p>
        <p>That was the year after Howard Harris III came back from winning the national intercollegiate rodeo championship as a student at the University of Idaho and persuaded his father, Stoney Harris, to put on a weekly rodeo. Stoney Harris had been holding an annual rodeo for the Salem County Fair for a number of years to supplement the family livestock business, so he was willing to take a flier on his son's idea.</p>
        <p>In 1957 and 1958, Cowtown was syndicated on national television, which attracted cowboys from all over the Northeast.</p>
        <p>What makes Cowtown wonderful, though, is that greenhorns are treated, if not like honored guests, at least quite amicably.</p>
        <p>The longtime public address announcer, Dusty Cleveland, fully explains every event and scoring system, from the need to spend eight seconds on a bareback bronc, to the intricacies of the proper way to ride in the calf-roping competition. With Mr. Cleveland's analytical patter and calls for cheers for fallen cowboys (''Talk about closer than a coat of paint! Let's put our hands together and appreciate a good ride!''), it's like having a vintage Phil Rizzuto on the P.A. system.</p>
        <p>No one laughs as the novice sidles up to browse at First Frontier Tack Shop, at the main gate.</p>
        <p>There are belts and hats and all sorts of cowhand paraphernalia for humans, but the more entertaining items are equine treats. The Stall Ball, for instance, is a rubbery soccer-type ball that a horse can bat with his head in his stall. It costs a mere $24.75 and is apple-cinnamon-scented. Then there are Great Hampton Horse Treats, multigrained packets in Moonbeam Apple, Sunshine Carrot or Starlight Molasses, for a mere $4.99.</p>
        <p>Admission at Cowtown is $10 for adults and $5 for children for the two-hour event. The refreshment prices run $1 for a pound of peanuts in the shell, 75 cents for a candy apple and $4 for the Bulldogger, a chili hot dog. There's a funnel-cake-only line, too, which must mean that cowboys don't have to look after their waistlines.</p>
        <p>The rodeo begins promptly at 7:30 with the Grand Entry, in which all the competitors parade into the ring on horseback, waving to the crowd and doing loops a Big Ten college band would envy. Howard Harris's granddaughter, Courtney, 19, leads the procession, sitting tall in the saddle and carrying an American flag. Howard Harris retired more than a decade ago and left the tradition of Cowtown to his son, Grant.</p>
        <p>Grant Harris calls himself the producer of Cowtown, overseeing livestock development, periodic flea markets and auctions, and selling clothing at the Cowtown Cowboy Outfitters shop, as well as overseeing the rodeo, on the 1,500-acre Harris property along the rural part of U.S. Highway 40. He also works the stands on Saturday nights, resplendent in his clean blue jeans and sturdy cowboy hat and boots. People, no doubt regulars, call to him and he tips his hat or says a quiet ''Hi'' as he moves along.</p>
        <p>During the bull-riding event, Mr. Harris sits on his horse in the middle of the ring, leaning forward in the saddle, and deferring to his dog, Buddy, a Queensland blue heeler. Buddy, about two hands high, stays low to the ground, close to his owner, most of the time. But when one of the rodeo clowns can't steer a bull back into the pen, Buddy jumps up and, yapping all the way, shoos him back where he belongs. The Goliath-cowering-before-David scene always elicits cheers from the crowd.</p>
        <p>Actually, there is lots of cheering. With Mr. Cleveland's public-address encouragement and the constant banjo music of Dave and the Wranglers, it is hard to feel anything but sympathy when, say, a bronc bucks a cowboy on his bottom or one of the horses kicks over a couple of obstacles in the girls' barrel racing.</p>
        <p>In girls' barrel racing, the competitors have to circle three barrels placed around the rodeo ring while being timed. It is the only event for women at Cowtown. No one questions the ''girls'' part of name; cowgirls is not an antifeminist term. As one T-shirt said, ''Cowgirls Lead; Cowboys Follow.''</p>
        <p>This particular Saturday night, Jennifer Ridgely, from Wyoming, Del., seemed a good bet to win, circling the barrels in a mere 18.50 seconds. But she was bested by Becky Baker, wearing a black hat and purple pants, in 18.06 seconds. Ms. Baker is from nearby Elmer, home of the Elmer Diner, where an official program from Cowtown gets customers 10 percent off a meal.</p>
        <p>Elmer isn't the only Southwestern Jersey metropolis represented at Cowtown. Some have businesses that have reserved-seat skyboxes of sorts along the north rim of the Cowtown ring. The wooden structure houses several boxes holding eight people (maybe 10 in a pinch) on what appear to be modified padded bus seats. Red-and-white painted signs show the owners of the boxes: Russ's Electric of Pennsville, Farmer's Bank of Mullica Hill, Pole Tavern Equipment.</p>
        <p>The events progress at a pretty good pace, with 8 to 20 or so contestants in each of seven categories: bareback riding, steer wrestling, saddle-bronc riding, calf-roping, bull-riding, team calf-roping and girls' barrel racing. Prize money runs a few thousand dollars a night, but sometimes cowboys come from as far as Florida and Texas to win it, hoping to qualify for regional seedings in the national rodeo finals.</p>
        <p>This particular Saturday had two milestones. Mojo, one of Grant Harris's prize bulls, had only been ridden successfully once. Russell Jones, a star rider from Ballston Spa, N.Y., was assigned to him. Mr. Jones looked ready, and held on for a few seconds short of the eight required. After he threw Mr. Jones, Mojo did a little prance, much like a winning boxer, before being yapped back through the gate by the ever-vigilant Buddy.</p>
        <p>Earlier, an aging bull named Lots of Spots had his last ride. He didn't throw his rider, Sean Harvey, but he, too, took a long last pass at the ring he had visited weekly for several years. The announcer, Mr. Cleveland, said Lots of Spots was going to stud the very next day to produce prospective bucking bull babies.</p>
        <p>And, with any luck, some will be Saturday night stars for a long Cowtown future.</p>
