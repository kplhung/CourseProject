        <p>Alan Metrick letter comments on Postings item (July 23) about new Chambers Hotel on West 56th Street, noting hotel's plans for all-male housekeeping staff; questions legality of such a plan, and asks who exactly is supposed to be impressed by this 'ridiculous affectation'</p>

        <p>One of the side benefits of reading The New York Times, especially on Sundays, is learning about the ever-spiraling heights of pretension in our town.

        <p>One of the side benefits of reading The New York Times, especially on Sundays, is learning about the ever-spiraling heights of pretension in our town. Accordingly, I'm not sure if I was more horrified or amused by the Postings item about the Chambers Hotel [''New Hotel on West 56th Street; A Downtown Look in Midtown,'' July 23].</p>
        <p>According to your reporter, the hotel plans an all-male housekeeping staff. Aside from appearing to be patently illegal and demonstrably unfair to women who might want these jobs, who, exactly, is supposed to be impressed by this ridiculous affectation?</p>
        <p>What level of exclusivity do the the developers hope to achieve? Or do I miss the point? Perhaps this is someone's idea of creating a subtle, high-toned bordello-like atmosphere for some guests. Next, I suppose, we'll be reading about a hotel that plans to have its cleaning staff wear abbreviated French maids' uniforms and carry feather dusters.</p>
