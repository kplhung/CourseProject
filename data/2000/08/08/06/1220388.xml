        <p>''Redmen had some political issues,'' said Chris Marciani, director of business development at S.M.E. Power Branding, which helped St. John's Univeristy find its new identity in 1994. ''Red Storm wasn't offensive but had the same strong impact.''</p>
        <p>The name Patriots, for the State University of New York at Stony Brook, ''really made more sense in New England,'' Mr. Marciani said. ''They became the Seawolves becasue of all the water around Long Island, and the wolf was a logical and intimidating animal.''</p>
        <p>At Wayne State University in Detroit, ''There were some liabilities with Tartars,'' Mr. Marciani said. ''Not a lot of people knew what that was.'' The new name, Warriors, respects its heritage - Tartars were Mongolian invaders.</p>
