        <p>Atomic Field</p>
        <p>Two Poems.</p>
        <p>By Nicholas Christopher.</p>
        <p>Harcourt, $23.</p>
        <p>Drawing inspiration from personal, cosmic and pop-cultural subjects, Nicholas Christopher's seventh book of poetry is made up of two long narrative poems, ''1962'' and ''1972,'' that trace watershed years in a young man's life. In a form that has the feel -- though not the structure -- of haiku, each of the poems consists of 45 short, numbered lyrics in which spare, immediate images are gathered together by a subtle epiphany. In ''1962,'' for example, the 11-year-old speaker presents haunting, sketchlike portraits of topics like Marilyn Monroe's death; the stars ''which constantly change position / while appearing never to move'' above his New York City apartment building; a neighborhood candy store; and a screening of ''Dr. No.'' A decade later, cultural signifiers like the Cuban missile crisis have given way to Vietnam's ''waves of napalm,'' and earlier odes to ''Superman'' comic books are replaced by more passionate objects of admiration -- like sexy women wearing tie-dye. But ''1972'' suffers from Christopher's occasionally nostalgic and prosaic descriptions of such well-trodden counterculture experiences as dropping acid (''the carpet now streaming thousands of colors / into an arc that spans the room''). Christopher uses the mystery of the atom as an overarching theme, and his intent seems to be to split two whole years into a montage of discrete, elemental images. Since a strong interaction never takes place among these atmospheric verse snapshots, their combined effect is less explosive than ethereal.</p>
