        <p>MARGARET CHO was a virgin. That was why her friends gathered Wednesday night in her suite at the Paramount Hotel to initiate her into the world of those who can spell Gervase -- a universe that does not include contestants on the television series ''Survivor.''</p>

        <p>MARGARET CHO was a virgin. That was why her friends gathered Wednesday night in her suite at the Paramount Hotel to initiate her into the world of those who can spell Gervase -- a universe that does not include contestants on the television series ''Survivor.''</p>
        <p>She needed help, because she was going to appear the next morning on ''The Early Show'' on CBS to analyze the latest ''Survivor'' episode. She knew nothing about it, not where the island was (''It's near China?'' she asked), nor any of the players or rules.</p>
        <p>Suite 1526 was fully stocked with viewing aids: Triscuits, Bagel Chips, salsa, Tostitos, peeled baby carrots, Evian, but no booze.</p>
        <p>Ms. Cho speaks honestly in her new one-woman film, ''I'm the One That I Want,'' based on her stage show, about battling her weight and her overindulgence in alcohol and other mind-altering substances. In the film, she also explores being a ''fag hag'' (''Thank god for gay men, because if it weren't for gay men, I wouldn't talk to men at all''), and addresses the question of her own sexual orientation. (''Am I straight? Am I gay?'' she recalls wondering in the film. ''Then I realized, I'm just slutty.'')</p>
        <p>Friends began arriving and showering her with gifts. Christopher Schelling, her literary agent (is there a stand-up comic who isn't writing a book?), offered a bag from Three Dog Bakery for her dog, home in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>Chin-a Panaccione, who shares a Korean ancestry with Ms. Cho but has an Italian father (''So my mother would make kim chee and lasagna,'' Ms. Panaccione said), offered Ms. Cho some DVD's.</p>
        <p>''The quality is so much better,'' Ms. Panaccione, who works in film, said. ''Porn looks really good on DVD. The camera angles are particularly good. Or 'Lost in Space,' '' she added.</p>
        <p>'' 'Matrix,' too!'' Evan Greenberg, a New York University student, interjected.</p>
        <p>The conversation turned to ''Survivor.'' One thing her friends agreed on: the naked gay guy had to go.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schelling said flatly, ''Every gay man I know just hates him.''</p>
        <p>Guests began free-associating. ''Did you know there's a 'Survivor' cow in front of 'The Early Show' near F. A. O. Schwarz?'' Jessie Cohen, an office temp, asked.</p>
        <p>Stephen Schulman, a publicist on Ms. Cho's movie, tried to get the star back on track. '' 'Survivor' is not about surviving,'' he offered. ''It's about back-stabbing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schelling, who was seated next to Ms. Cho on a white Philippe Starck  tall-back bench, which looked about right for King Cole, tried to fill her in on tactics. (The series will conclude on Aug. 23, with the voting of the winner of the $1 million purse.) ''At first, it was the people who were unpopular who got kicked off the island,'' he said. ''But now, they try to figure who is going to win, and then they vote them off.''</p>
        <p>Talk turned to the contests the castaways compete in to win a phone call home or temporary immunity from being voted off the island. ''The challenges are like, how long you can hold your breath under water, things that guys can win,'' Karen Taussig, Ms. Cho's manager, said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Panaccione then gave away a big secret. ''If you go to the Web site, and get under the HTML, there's a little red 'x' next to every name but one,'' she said. ''That's the one who gets the prize.''</p>
        <p>Her Deep Throat on this? Entertainment Weekly.</p>
        <p>''I've heard the winner is Gervase,'' Mr. Greenberg said.</p>
        <p>The program began. Like golf announcers, the assembled guests whispered asides to Ms. Cho as each castaway came on screen.</p>
        <p>''Richard used to be a corporate trainer.'' (Also ''the naked gay guy.'')</p>
        <p>''Rudy -- the old guy -- was a Navy Seal.''</p>
        <p>''Sean is a doctor.''</p>
        <p>''Gervase has two kids, but he's not married.'' (Almost true. Gervase has four children, but he's not married.)</p>
        <p>After 15 minutes, Ms. Cho made her first observation: ''The thing about human nature is to distrust people who excel. It's why we worship mediocrity.''</p>
        <p>Heads nodded. So true.</p>
        <p>Now, there were commercials to deride. The reaction to a teaser for ''Autumn in New York,'' a romance with Richard Gere and Winona Ryder, was unanimous. Eueueuew. One guest, Zekio Dawson, noted that Ms. Ryder was on the cover of Jane magazine. ''There was the cover line, 'Is Your Look Dated?' '' he said. ''I wouldn't want to be on a cover with that on it.''</p>
        <p>Back to ''Survivor,'' a cultural phenomenon that seems to positively require group viewing. There was universal consternation when Sue, the truck driver, burst into tears over what she would or wouldn't do to Kelly, the white-water guide. ''What happened just now?'' Ms. Cho said.</p>
        <p>''Could we get a replay on that one?'' someone else asked.</p>
        <p>Then Rudy, the Navy Seal, began expounding on Gervase's habit of fathering children out of wedlock. ''There's abortion,'' Rudy said.</p>
        <p>''Oh,'' Ms. Cho announced, ''that's Roe v. Wade-Rudy.''</p>
        <p>More time passed. Gervase shared his prize, a slice of pizza. No one made fun. Suddenly, Mr. Dawson had a revelation: ''You know what? They all have tattoos.'' He enumerated the tattoos he had seen, what they were and where they were located.</p>
        <p>Back to ''Survivor.'' Sean, the doctor, was on. ''Look at that six-pack!'' Mr. Schulman said, admiring his abdomen.</p>
        <p>Looking at strangers in bathing suits has to be one of the primary attractions of the series, especially for those who do not yet have their fall catalogs from Victoria's Secret. Ms. Cho leaped up and grabbed a bottle of Evian. Soon, the episode was over and -- consternation! -- it was Gervase who was voted off the island.</p>
        <p>''I guess the HTML was wrong,'' Ms. Panaccione said weakly.</p>
        <p>All assembled tried to sum the experience up for Ms. Cho, who was less than 12 hours away from needing a sound bite.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schelling said, ''This is 'Citizen Kane,' and that other show, 'Big Brother,' is . . .''</p>
        <p>'' 'Melrose Place?' '' Ms. Cohen offered.</p>
        <p>'' 'Big Brother' is 'No Exit,' '' Mr. Schelling finished.</p>
        <p>Ms. Cho wondered, ''Wouldn't you be sick of the people there after all that time?''</p>
        <p>''Yeah, I'd vote myself off the island,'' Mr. Schulman said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Cho practiced answers to the obvious questions: Who will win? Would you eat bugs for $1 million? What personal item would you bring? ''I'd bring an armoire,'' she said. ''Can't leave home without that.''</p>
        <p>She said the series was ''pretty addictive and dramatic,'' at least judging by the one episode. ''But I don't know if I'd watch it again,'' she added.</p>
        <p>Thursday morning, when Bryant Gumbel primed his three experts on the panel to discuss CBS's blockbuster show, Ms. Cho jumped right in: ''I hate Rich,'' she said. Welcome Ms. Cho. You're now a member of the tribe.</p>
