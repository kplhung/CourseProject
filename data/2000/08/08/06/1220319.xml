        <p>Even natives love to deride Los Angeles as a city without a downtown. Or more accurately as a city with several, from City Hall to the office towers and mall of Century City, to the beach at Santa Monica 15 miles away. But for at least one week this month, the Democratic National Convention will put the spotlight back on the city's original downtown, where it began and prospered until its center of gravity started shifting steadily westward more than 70 years ago.</p>
        <p>The skyline lacks an iconic landmark, save perhaps the City Hall tower made famous by ''Dragnet.''

        <p>Even natives love to deride Los Angeles as a city without a downtown. Or more accurately as a city with several, from City Hall to the office towers and mall of Century City, to the beach at Santa Monica 15 miles away. But for at least one week this month, the Democratic National Convention will put the spotlight back on the city's original downtown, where it began and prospered until its center of gravity started shifting steadily westward more than 70 years ago.</p>
        <p>The skyline lacks an iconic landmark, save perhaps the City Hall tower made famous by ''Dragnet.'' Streets are often all but deserted at night, and the district is crisscrossed by freeways whose ramps make navigating its vertiginous one-way streets tricky for the uninitiated. Its certain death and imminent rebirth have been alternately predicted for decades.</p>
        <p>But downtown is, in fact, experiencing what city officials and real estate titans hope will amount to a comeback, and nothing will symbolize those aspirations better than the convention's presence Aug. 14 to 17, in the spanking new Staples Center. Downtown can still seem a long hike from the luxury canyons of Beverly Hills and Brentwood, and it is only one slice of the bubbling pie that is Los Angeles, but an intrepid visitor could find plenty to do there.</p>
        <p>From the kitschy-quaint shops of Olvera Street, the brick arcade that was the site of the original Spanish pueblo of Los Angeles, to the Deco-mission-style grandeur of Union Station, to Little Tokyo, to the bustling multiethnic buzz of the Grand Central Market, with its butchers and  greengrocers stretching from Broadway to Hill Street, downtown can be a vital place. For better or worse, it remains the city's seat of high culture, with theater, opera and symphonies at the Los Angeles Music Center and a gaggle of museums.</p>
        <p>Events</p>
        <p>The convention has inspired Gallery at 777, 777 South Figueroa Street, an art gallery in a downtown office building. Through Oct. 26, it is presenting an exhibition of political cartoons portraying the history of the Democratic Party. The drawings  come from the collection of Dennis Ryan, a financial adviser with a trove of more than 2,000 cartoons, ranging from Thomas Nast to more contemporary artists. Open Monday to Friday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is free.</p>
        <p>The city's most prestigious live theater remains the Mark Taper Forum, and its schedule features one West Coast premiere and a new work by August Wilson. First is ''Expecting Isabel,'' Lisa Loomer's account of the complications that ensue when a 30-something couple decide to have a baby. It runs through Aug. 27, with performances Tuesday to Saturday at 8 p.m., Sunday at 7:30 p.m., and matinees Saturday and Sunday at 2:30, with no 8 p.m. performance Aug. 12. Tickets are $29 to $42. Call (213) 628-2772, or on the Web at www.TaperAhmanson.com. Previews begin Sept. 3 for Mr. Wilson's ''King Hedley II,'' which opens Sept. 14. It is the latest installment in his chronicle of the black experience in America. Tuesday to Sunday at 7:30 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday matinees at 2 p.m. Tickets: $30 to $44. Telephone same as above.</p>
        <p>In summer, the Los Angeles Philharmonic moves to the Hollywood Bowl, and there is no more elegant place for a cool California evening with a box supper and a bottle of wine in seats with flip-up tables. Performances there also include a concert version of Rodgers and Hammerstein's ''Carousel,'' on Sunday, to a Tchaikovsky fireworks spectacular Sept. 1 to 3. Most performances at 7:30 or 8:30 p.m., tickets from $3 to $110. Call (323) 850-2000.</p>
        <p>At the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, 250 South Grand Avenue, (213) 621-2766, the featured exhibition through Aug. 20 is ''The Social Scene,'' more than 300 documentary photographs from the 1930's through the 80's by photographers from Diane Arbus to Garry Winogrand, grouped thematically on topics like ''American Icons'' and ''Character Studies.'' Open Tuesday to Sunday, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Thursday to 9 p.m. (8 p.m. beginning Sept. 14). Admission: $6; $4 students and those 65 and over.</p>
        <p>The museum's sister institution, the Geffen Contemporary, 152 North Central Avenue, (213) 621-1727, features ''At the End of the Century: 100 years of Architecture'' through Sept. 24. The exhibition examines how architecture evolved in response to intellectual, cultural and social factors, and has over 1,000 objects from scale models to photos, films and drawings. Hours and admission are the same as at the museum, with a free shuttle between the two.</p>
        <p>Sightseeing</p>
        <p>For a bird's-eye view from Bunker Hill, the downtown cluster of office towers, try Angels Flight, a two-car funicular railway built in 1901 to connect the commercial heart of the city to the Victorian residential enclave above. Recently restored, it climbs a 315-foot incline to the modern financial district built in the 1960's and 70's where the Victorian homes once stood, in a quaint reminder of the city's relative youth and phenomenal growth. Fare: 25 cents.</p>
        <p>Not far away, at the grand old Union Station, is the terminus of Los Angeles's newly completed 17.4-mile subway, at nearly $5 billion the most expensive subway in American history. Troubled by more than a decade of construction delays and cost overruns, the subway opened its final link this summer, and at last offers some worthwhile destinations just a short ride from downtown: Hollywood Boulevard, and Universal Studios in North Hollywood. The trains are clean and quiet and the stations spectacularly decorated, with tile murals at one stop and lighting that mimics a stage set at another. The fare is $1.35 (cheaper for weekly passes) and there are no turnstiles, so you're on your honor.</p>
        <p>The Grand Central Public Market, 317 South Broadway at West Third Street, is one of the few places in all of Los Angeles where the city's rich polyglot population can be seen in all its diversity as downtown office workers and immigrants from virtually every country mingle amid the cheery, vital bustle of old-fashioned food stalls, butchers and fishmongers. Enter hungry, and you'll be full when you leave.</p>
        <p>No building downtown is more beautiful than the Los Angeles Central Library, 630 West Fifth Street, between Grand and Flower, a 1930 Byzantine-Moorish-Egyptian-Romanlandmark with a modern addition. The restored reading rooms are beautiful, and a new auditorium is host to a lecture series and special events; (213) 228-7000. Just outside is Cafe Pinot, a branch of a popular group of local brasseries with a charming outdoor cafe under a clump of olive trees.</p>
        <p>The Japanese American National Museum, which opened a major new building last year next to the Geffen at 369 East First Street, is the nation's only museum dedicated to the Japanese experience in the United States. It is housed in two structures, a 1925 Buddhist temple and the new 85,000-square-foot pavilion by Gyo Obata, which houses, among other rotating exhibits, a reconstructed barracks from a World War II internment camp for Japanese-Americans; (213) 625-0414.</p>
        <p>Where to Stay</p>
        <p>Hotels throughout the city, in addition to these downtown establishments, are booked solid for the convention week.</p>
        <p>The New Otani, 120 South Los Angeles Street, a mecca for Japanese businessmen and tourists, is a convenient, attractive downtown perch with an elegant garden, a reputation for good service, and a well-regarded restaurant, A Thousand Cranes. The 434 rooms include three Japanese-style suites, in the heart of Little Tokyo. Shiatsu massage and sauna are available in the spa. Rates: $180 to $250; (800) 421-8795, fax (213) 622-0980.</p>
        <p>The Los Angeles Marriott Downtown, 333 South Figueroa Street, was formerly a Sheraton. Renovated two years ago, this 14-story convention hotel has a crisp, clean feel, and is near the Music Center and other attractions. Rates: $199 to $350, with weekend packages as low as $119; (800) 321-2211 or (213) 617-1133, fax (213) 613-0291.</p>
        <p>Budget: Within walking distance of all civic-center attractions, the Miyako Inn and Spa, 328 East First Street, offers simple, spare guest rooms with floral print bedspreads and muted tones, all equipped with minibars and safes. The spa has four whirlpools, and there's karaoke in the lounge. Rates in the 174 rooms are $107 to $139; (800) 228-6596, fax (213) 617-2700.</p>
        <p>Luxury: The Biltmore, 506 South Grand Avenue, the grande dame of downtown, was the largest hotel west of Chicago when it opened in 1923. The site of early Academy Award  dinners, it has undergone several renovations in recent years and remains the pride of the neighborhood. Its elegant lobby and bar are the place to see and be seen. As typical for hotels of its age, guest rooms can be tiny, but the public spaces, with Moorish touches and coffered ceilings, will let you pretend you're Douglas Fairbanks or Mary Pickford. The 620 rooms and 63 suites go for $150 to $220, depending on availability; (800) 245-8673, fax (213) 612-1546.</p>
        <p>The Wyndham Checkers Hotel, 535 South Grand Avenue, is a boutique outpost convenient for business travelers. Its 173 rooms and 15 suites can be smallish. But it is among the classiest places downtown, and it has a rooftop pool. Rates from $199 to $1,200 for the penthouse suite; (213) 624-0000, fax (213) 626-9906.</p>
        <p>Where to Eat</p>
        <p>Routinely ranked as one of the best seafood houses in this seaside town, the Water Grill, at 544 South Grand Avenue, is all curving wood and cozy booths. Its ice-cold, honest martinis make the perfect foil for the towering platters of fresh, chilled shellfish stacked on crushed ice. Grilled, baked or sauteed, the fish is the freshest around, from Pacific tuna tartare to Dungeness crab cakes to a chowder of Manila clams. Dinner for two $150, with a moderately priced wine. Reservations: (213) 891-0900.</p>
        <p>Joachim Splichal is among the reigning imperial chef-entrepreneurs of Los Angeles (perhaps best known for Patina and his bevy of Pinot brasseries), and his latest entry is a traditional American steakhouse, Nick and Stef's, named for his two sons, in the Wells Fargo Center at 330 South Hope Street. In a sleek urban setting, with a glass-walled aging chamber displaying cold hunks of meat sitting on racks, waiters make Caesar salad tableside and serve up strips, filets, rib-eyes and Porterhouses grilled, juicy and thick. Biggest complaint: the side dishes are much less impressive than the main event. But the lemon meringue pie is the kind your grandmother made. Dinner for two $150, with wine; (213) 680-0330.</p>
        <p>The Original Pantry Cafe, 887 South Figueroa Street, a short walk north of the Staples Center, is a local institution, owned by Mayor Richard J. Riordan. It never closes and is the place to go for breakfasts, steaks, chops and baked goods. A greasy spoon and proud of it. Dinner for two about $30, but go for breakfast or lunch and it's even cheaper (and probably better); (213) 972-9279.</p>
        <p>Philippe the Original, 1001 North Alameda Street, across from Union Station, claims to have invented the French dip sandwich. There's certainly no questioning the authenticity of this beloved spot, with its sawdust-covered floors, long bench tables and fabulous food. Don't miss the homemade tapioca. Lunch for two with fresh lemonade, $15. (213) 628-3781.</p>
        <p>Hama Sushi, in the Japanese Village Plaza Mall at 347 East Second Street in Little Tokyo, is a highly reliable choice for sushi. Small and unpretentious, it is full of jovial chatter at lunch, and the fish is fresh  and the service friendly. A meal of sushi runs about $15 to $20, and beer and sake is available. (213) 680-3454.</p>
