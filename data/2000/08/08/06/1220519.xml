        <p>'21' CLUB  **  [Rating: two stars]  (212) 582-7200; 21 West 52nd Street, between Fifth Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas; $$$$; smoking in the lounge; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>Few New York City restaurants have a richer history than ''21.'' For most of the past century, American royalty has been entertaining at this place, which has the feeling of a private club. Current appetizers include tartare of ahi tuna, black bass and Alaskan salmon with fruit crisps; Maine crab cake with cucumber salad and curry-carrot sauce; butternut squash risotto with wild mushrooms and sugar snap peas; and baby dandelion greens with watermelon and shaved parmesan.  Main courses include roasted Maine lobster with purple potatoes and Napa cabbage; clove-studded rack of lamb with chive-potato dumplings; hickory fired filet mignon with morel mushrooms and endive; and pan-seared halibut with beluga lentils, coriander, cumin and mint.

        <p>ESTIATORIO MILOS  **  [Rating: two stars]  (212) 245-7400; 125 West 55th Street, between the Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenue; $$$$; smoking at the bar; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>Clean, spare, blindingly white, the entire focus of this Greek restaurant is on the display of fish by the open kitchen, where gorgeous fish are arrayed on ice; choose one and it is grilled simply and brought to your table. Appetizers include paper-thin zucchini, eggplant and saganaki cheese, lightly fried; Maryland soft shell crab; Canada sea scallops, charcoal-grilled on the skewer with Vidalia onions; and grilled calamari, stuffed with feta cheese and served over spinach. Entrees include Florida pompano; Holland dover sole, served on the bone; yellow-fin tuna, seared in red wine vinegar over a bed of baby beet leaves; marinated swordfish on the skewer with onion, peppers and tomatoes; and grilled organic baby lamb chops. (Review:  9/17/97)</p>
        <p>JUDSON GRILL  ***  [Rating: three stars]  (212) 582-5252; 152 West 52nd Street, between the Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenue; $$$; smoking at the bar; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>The secret of Bill Telepan's cooking is in the quality of his products.  Mr. Telepan, the chef at this big, bright place, has turned a good cafe into a terrific one. Appetizers include peekytoe crab cocktail with osetra caviar, avocado, scallion and a lemon verbena vinaigrette; ribbons of egg pasta with chanterelles, local baby vegetables and creme fraiche; and grilled quail salad with duck and dried fig sausage with fresh figs and purslane and almonds. Main courses include roasted rack of organic pork, steamed corn pudding, crisp fresh bacon with wild greens; roasted Maine lobster with sweet corn, stewed cabbage and potato puree; and Muscovy duck breast with seared foie gras, carrot puree, fricassee of carrots and flageolets in a sherry walnut vinaigrette. (Review:  6/3/98)</p>
        <p>OSTERIA DEL CIRCO  **  [Rating: two stars]  (212) 265-3636; 120 West 55th Street, between the Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenue; $$; smoking at the bar and outside; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>Circo means circus in Italian, and this is a cheerfully expensive one.  Appetizers include asparagus with lemon and extra virgin olive oil; fried shrimp, calamari, fish and zucchini served with remoulade and spicy tomato sauces; and warm capon salad with leeks, frisee and green tomato ''mostards.'' First courses include taglioni with fresh tomato sauce and basil; potato dumplings with bolognese sauce; and spaghetti with basil pesto, potatoes, green beans and tomato confit.  Entrees include grilled tuna with snow peas, zucchini, carrots and salmoriglio sauce; filet of beef with asparagus, endive and frantoiana salsa; and veal milanese with arugula salad and herb-roasted potatoes. (Review: 3/8/96)</p>
        <p>SUGIYAMA  ***  [Rating: three stars]  (212) 956-0670; 251 West 55th Street, between Broadway and Eighth Avenue; $$$$; no smoking; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>Dining at this small, spare, modern Japanese restaurant is like a little trip to Japan. The modern kaiseki meals are prix fixe; you tell the chef how many courses you want (5 to 14) and how much you are willing to spend, and simply put yourself in his hands. First courses include seasonal Japanese fish and vegetables.  Other courses include assorted sashimi; grilled steak or seafood served on a sizzling plate; seasonal clear soup; rice with various vegetables, miso soup, and Japanese pickles. Dessert is grapefruit wine jelly with cream. (Review: 3/17/99)</p>
