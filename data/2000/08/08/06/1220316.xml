        <p>Q I am one of the original incorporators of the Three Twenty Five Cooperative on Central Park West. When our co-op was formed in 1965, the incorporators approved a bylaw stipulating that there shall be 20 ''authorized memberships'' in the co-op and that each member shall have one vote. The number of memberships has remained unchanged since then. Recently, however, the board has said that it can reduce the number of memberships without any participation of the stockholders. This would seem to be at odds with another bylaw provision that requires a majority vote of stockholders to amend the bylaws. Does the board have the power to reduce the number of memberships in a co-op even though the bylaws state categorically that there shall be 20 authorized memberships? . . . Anita Lande, Manhattan.</p>
        <p>A Arthur Gussaroff, a Manhattan co-op lawyer, said that since the name of the letter writer's co-op includes the word cooperative, and since cooperators are referred to as ''members'' rather than shareholders, the co-op was most likely incorporated under the Cooperative Corporation Law rather than the Business Corporation Law, the law under which most co-ops in New York were formed. As a result, he said, the rules governing the letter writer's co-op are somewhat different from those that govern the vast majority of co-ops in New York.</p>

        <p>Q I am one of the original incorporators of the Three Twenty Five Cooperative on Central Park West. When our co-op was formed in 1965, the incorporators approved a bylaw stipulating that there shall be 20 ''authorized memberships'' in the co-op and that each member shall have one vote. The number of memberships has remained unchanged since then. Recently, however, the board has said that it can reduce the number of memberships without any participation of the stockholders. This would seem to be at odds with another bylaw provision that requires a majority vote of stockholders to amend the bylaws. Does the board have the power to reduce the number of memberships in a co-op even though the bylaws state categorically that there shall be 20 authorized memberships? . . . Anita Lande, Manhattan.</p>
        <p>A Arthur Gussaroff, a Manhattan co-op lawyer, said that since the name of the letter writer's co-op includes the word cooperative, and since cooperators are referred to as ''members'' rather than shareholders, the co-op was most likely incorporated under the Cooperative Corporation Law rather than the Business Corporation Law, the law under which most co-ops in New York were formed. As a result, he said, the rules governing the letter writer's co-op are somewhat different from those that govern the vast majority of co-ops in New York.</p>
        <p>One of the more significant differences, Mr. Gussaroff said, is that with co-ops incorporated under the Cooperative Corporation Law, the board has the power to amend the bylaws on its own and without the prior consent of the stockholders.  However, Mr. Gussaroff said, for an amendment adopted by the board to become permanent, it must be approved by an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the stockholders at the next annual meeting.</p>
        <p>What that means, he said, is that the board probably has the power to reduce the number of authorized memberships stipulated in the bylaws -- at least until the next meeting of the stockholders. At that time, Mr. Gussaroff said, the members have the ability to reject the change -- by not approving it by a two-thirds vote -- or to substitute a change of their own.</p>
        <p>He added that if the co-op's bylaws contain a provision that requires only a majority vote of members to amend them, and the co-op was organized under the Cooperative Corporation Law, then the provision would violate the law and be unenforceable.</p>
        <p>In any event, he said, the letter writer should be aware that any reduction in the number of members in a co-op ultimately increases the voting power of the remaining individual members.</p>
        <p>''In my mind it's better to be have one vote out of 19 than to have one vote out of 20,'' Mr. Gussaroff said.</p>
        <p>Parking Spaces In a Co-op</p>
        <p>Q In 1986 I purchased a co-op apartment in a building that had a parking garage owned by the co-op. At that time, I was told that parking spaces were not transferred with apartments, but that there was a waiting list for spaces that became available.  I asked to be put on that list. It has now come to my attention that residents who bought apartments after I did have been given parking spots. It has been suggested that our previous managing agent may have ignored the list in assigning spots. If there was a deviation from the list, can I force the building to grant me a spot and to reimburse me for what I have had to pay to park in a neighborhood lot for the period of time that I should have had a spot? . . . Michael Herman, Manhattan.</p>
        <p>A Eric P. Gonchar, a Manhattan co-op lawyer, said that if a co-op owns a parking garage, it would be up to the board -- acting through the managing agent -- to assign spaces in whatever manner the board deems appropriate. If there is a waiting list, he said, and if the previous managing agent skipped over the letter writer in assigning spaces, then it would appear that the board would have at least a moral obligation to give the next available space to the writer.</p>
        <p>Forcing it to do so, however, as well as forcing it to provide reimbursement for fees paid for an alternate space, would be difficult, Mr. Gonchar said. That, he said, is because courts will generally decline to second-guess a board's actions -- including those taken through a managing agent -- unless it can be shown that the board was not acting in good faith and in the best interests of the corporation.</p>
