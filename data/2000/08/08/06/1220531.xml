        <p>Aftabuddin Rayman smokes alone, in windowless rooms, deep into the night.</p>
        <p>Four times a week, as most people are getting off work, Mr. Rayman eases his Toyota Camry into a narrow canyon of warehouses near the East River on the edge of Greenpoint. Dressed in a blue cotton uniform, he enters the cool inner chambers of the Acme Smoked Fish Corporation, where, on a typical day, 30,000 to 50,000 pounds of salmon, brook trout, whitefish, bluefish, sable and chubs await his arrival.</p>
        <p>The fish, whole or filleted, has already been cured in brine. It hangs in neat rows on six-foot-tall racks, above tiled floors that still glisten after being hosed down by the day shift. Almost alone in a silent factory that smells like smoldering campfires, Mr. Rayman wheels the racks, one after another, into walk-in ovens, creating a solid wall of fish in each one. He sets the thermostat, leaving his charges to dry for several hours, and then returns like a sorcerer to conjure up the smoke that will give the company's fish its trademark flavor.</p>
        <p>Acme has its origins in the early 1900's as a pushcart owned by a Russian immigrant named Harry Brownstein, who sold smoked fish in Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn. Today, under three of Mr. Brownstein's grandsons, the 150-employee company processes about eight million pounds of North Atlantic, Great Lakes, Pacific and South Pacific fish a year, selling to all states except Alaska, and occasionally to Israel.</p>
        <p>Among its customers are some of New York's most discerning fish purveyors. Saul Zabar drops in once a week to select stock for Zabar's smoked fish counter; Aquavit gets its herring and smoked salmon there; Mark Russ Federman shops there for his Lower East Side store Russ &amp; Daughters.</p>
        <p>And although Mr. Rayman's name may be unknown among Manhattan's epicurean glitterati, the idea that he should end up as smoker to the stars seems logical.</p>
        <p>''Somehow, everywhere I turn I end up with fish,'' said Mr. Rayman, 54, who comes from Guyana and spent his teenage years catching prawns on trawlers in the Atlantic Ocean. He moved to New York in 1984 and found a job at Acme, curing fish by day. Two years later, fate intervened.</p>
        <p>''The previous smoker, he took ill,'' Mr. Rayman said. One of the owners, Eric Caslow, showed him some techniques, and he became the fourth smoker in the company's history.</p>
        <p>Soon Mr. Rayman, a soft-spoken man with a modest smile, was experimenting with his own tricks. ''Of course, at first it wouldn't come out right,'' he said. ''Some days I'd give it too much smoke and it became dark. Sometimes I didn't dry it properly and it wouldn't cook.''</p>
        <p>Over the years, he mastered the subtleties of the craft, like learning to tell, by squeezing with one latex-gloved hand, when a fish is dry enough to be smoked (when pressed together the two sides should feel tacky, so the smoke can adhere to the skin). Or knowing by sight which fish were wild and which were farm-raised (the wild fish, which ''struggle for their food'' are not as fatty and can have blood spots from writhing in nets or on hooks).</p>
        <p>Mr. Rayman also learned the difference between cold and hot smoking. Cold smoking, which gives nova its bright orange color and sushi-like consistency, is more automated, requiring only periodic monitoring of the 72-degree temperature. To do so, Mr. Rayman rides a slow electric lift through a two-tiered chamber where sides of salmon lie in multilayered bunk beds, half-obscured by an opaque blanket of smoke.</p>
        <p>But hot smoking is where the artistry lies. ''The hot smoke is done through human initiative,'' Mr. Rayman said, heaving a 50-pound bag of sawdust into one of two smoke generators. For the next few hours, the kilnlike contraptions, which look something like antique washing machines, burn through several bags of the sawdust, pumping dense smoke through pipes that lead to the ovens. The fish is then cooked for several hours.</p>
        <p>Hot smoking, Mr. Rayman explained, entails a lot more than just ''setting the oven to x or y.'' The type and size of the fish dictate the methods. Whitefish and whiting are cooked at 180 degrees, but sable should go up only to about 120, ''otherwise the bellies start to open up and it doesn't cook,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Weather, too, plays a role. On hot, humid days the fish require three or four hours of drying but less smoking time. Winter days call for more smoking, but then it's easy to make the fish too dry.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rayman's work includes cleaning the smoke generators every day to remove accumulated tar. It can also involve grueling extra duty; around Christmas or Passover, he regularly works 16-hour shifts to meet all the extra orders.</p>
        <p>But the job also allows for down periods while the ovens do their magic. Mr. Rayman, who is Muslim, uses the time to attend to his religious duties. A calendar of prayer times hangs behind the smoking machines, and Mr. Rayman keeps a prayer rug and a plastic-wrapped copy of the Koran in a soot-blackened locker along the wall.</p>
        <p>Mr. Caslow, who trained Mr. Rayman, said there was very little turnover for the smoker's position.</p>
        <p>''It's kind of a lifetime job,'' he said. ''It needs somebody who's reliable, conscientious and relatively bright; otherwise a lot of other people's labor has gone for naught.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rayman contends that good training alone is not enough to make an expert smoker. ''They've got to care about it,'' he said. ''They've got to care about how the fish comes out. Not just to do it as a job.''</p>
        <p>It would seem that a fish smoker would run some of the same health risks as firefighters: stinging eyes, irritated sinuses and lungs. But Mr. Rayman says that the smoke doesn't bother him and that his doctor has given him a clean bill of health. His wife, a former packer at the company, maintains certain rules, though.</p>
        <p>''When I come home, the clothes I wear, you've got to put outside the bedroom,'' he said. He takes a bath every morning to slough off his smoky outer layer, ''or else I can't go in the bed,'' he added, laughing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rayman has three children, but none have followed him into his profession. And if, somewhere in the city, there is a community of fellow smokers with whom Mr. Rayman might compare technique and exchange tips, he has never heard of it.</p>
        <p>''But I never went out looking,'' he added, explaining that for him, solitude is a treasured part of his job. ''I can do this as long as I'm able to do it, you know, because I'm happy here,'' he said. ''I read the paper, read the Koran, read whatever I've got to read.''</p>
        <p>What about partaking in the delicacies that surround him 10 hours a day?</p>
        <p>''Very seldom,'' he said with an abashed smile. Fish plays a big part in Guyanese cuisine, he said, but it is rarely smoked. ''We grew up using a lot of tropical fish,'' he explained. ''We eat them in curries. It isn't that this fish isn't tasty, but we haven't acquired a taste for it.''</p>
