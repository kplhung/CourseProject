        <p>Robert Marks letter on Don Terry's July 16 article in issue about race in America holds fear prevents people from being together</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>I haven't lived Don Terry's (July 16) life and don't pretend to have experienced similar struggles. But my response as I read was, ''I know this feeling.'' I've known separation, isolation, confusion; haven't we all? I'm gay, I'm Jewish, I fail to live up to American ideals in so many ways. Who knows which of these, if any, is most salient? There is something (but only something) about talking about race that's not about race at all; it's about what stops us from being together; it's about yearning and love and sadness and, perhaps most of all, fear.</p>
