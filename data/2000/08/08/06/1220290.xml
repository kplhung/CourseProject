        <p>IN the spring of 1998, Tammy Stevens of Jacksonville, Fla., who uses a wheelchair, booked a three-night cruise to the Bahamas aboard Premier Cruises' Oceanic, a 35-year-old ship sailing out of Port Canaveral. Although she said she was assured by her travel agent and the line that her cabin aboard the Oceanic, also identified as the Big Red Boat I, was wheelchair-accessible, she found it was not</p>
        <p>Ms. Stevens said she wrote Premier to complain and was given a certificate for a 50 percent discount on a future cruise. After that, she began to look for a lawyer. Her subsequent legal action passed a watershed on June 11, when the Federal Court of Appeals in Atlanta ruled that the Americans With Disabilities Act applies to ''places of public accommodation'' aboard cruise ships, even foreign-flagged cruise ships if they are in U.S. ports or waters.</p>
        <p>This marked the first court decision in which the provisions of the  disabilities civil rights act, which is just 10 years old, were declared to apply to foreign-flag vessels owned by foreign corporations. The only American-flagged ocean cruise ship, the Independence, owned by American Hawaii Cruises, was declared a ''place of public accommodation''  under the act last year by a court in Hawaii. The Justice Department says it has not received complaints about ferries, lake and river vessels in the United States.</p>
        <p>The Florida decision comes years,  at least five, before the Department of Transportation and the Department of Justice are likely to complete any guidelines for accessibility on oceangoing ships. On this basis, among others, Premier's lawyers  are asking for a rehearing by the  Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit.</p>
        <p>''The opinion as written,'' the Premier petition said, ''will have a significant effect on virtually the entire cruise and shipping industry, a major revenue source for the State of Florida and the United States.''</p>
        <p>''We believe the court has misinterpreted the A.D.A. to apply to vessels,'' said Gary E. Davidson, a lawyer for Premier in Miami.</p>
        <p>The lawyers on both sides acknowledge that the 3-to-0 ruling by a panel of the appeals court is unlikely to be reheard, and it is possible that Tammy Stevens v. Premier Cruises may go to the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>Conflicting Concerns</p>
        <p>Wheelchair accessibility on cruise ships is a complex issue. About the time Ms. Stevens took her cruise, a federal agency known as the Access Board was forming an advisory committee to discuss what sort of rule might be proposed. The committee includes representatives of the cruise industry, and such consultations are drawn out. The committee is scheduled to report to the Access Board on Nov. 17. The board will then ponder a recommendation to the Department of Transportation. After more public comment, a rule would become final. If the pattern in other areas -- hotels, for example -- is followed, ships entering service after a certain date would have to meet the criteria right away and older ships would get longer to make ''readily achievable'' adaptations.</p>
        <p>Paul Beatty, who calls himself project manager for the Access Board, points out conflicts likely to impede proposed rules. Safety laws for ships require ledges and sealable barriers to keep water from flowing everywhere if the hull is pierced. No one wants to reduce safety at sea, yet the difficulties for wheelchair users are apparent when one notes that the formal name of the Access Board is the Architectural Barriers and Transportation Compliance Committee. Further, Mr. Beatty said, you could create a series of protective devices that would be pointless if the boat heeled, as a sailboat inevitably does and even a big cruise vessel sometimes may.</p>
        <p>Old Ships vs. New</p>
        <p>Mr. Beatty and others note that market forces have brought improved accessibility, mainly on new vessels, built with an awareness that future customers are to be found among graying baby boomers. Elevators, selected cabins with extra-wide entrance and toilet doors, roll-in showers and closets with pull-down rods are found on new ships.</p>
        <p>Older ships are hard to fix, and as the A.D.A. unfolded in the 90's, retrofitting proved the most difficult.</p>
        <p>The Oceanic, built in 1965, is an older ship, with 604 cabins. In her complaint, Ms. Stevens said she saw an ad for a three-night cruise aboard the Oceanic and decided to buy a cruise for her mother, herself and two other family members for Mother's Day. She said in an interview she was told there were four ''handicapped cabins,'' one of them wheelchair accessible, and it was booked for Mother's Day.</p>
        <p>Ms. Stevens, who is a development officer for the Jacksonville Zoo, shifted her date to get the cabin, and said she had to pay more than the advertised starting price of $349 for it. The accessibility was limited to a ramp over the ledge on the bathroom door, she said, but the toilet was so close to the door that she could not get to it in her wheelchair. She was forced to use a bucket or have her guests lift her onto the commode, she said, and  bathe from a bucket or be lifted into and out of the shower.</p>
        <p>Ms. Stevens's lawyers, Jennifer L. Augspurger and Arlene Karin Kline of Boca Raton, initially sued for deceptive practices under Florida law and for an injunction under the federal disability law. The Department of Justice supported a revised complaint. Officials there and advocates for the disabled consider the facts in the case appropriate for a court test of the applicability of the law.</p>
        <p>The 1998 complaint identified Premier as a Canadian corporation, but Mr. Davidson said that the line was a Cayman Islands corporation then, and is now a Bermuda corporation. The Big Red Boat I continues to list itself as Bahamian, one of the more popular ''flags of convenience'' used by virtually all oceangoing cruise vessels visiting the United States.</p>
        <p>Premier has been discussing the case with other companies and the International Council of Cruise Lines, an association representing 17 lines that operate 95 vessels in the North American market. A spokeswoman for this organization said no conclusion had been reached.</p>
        <p>Another Issue: Fire Alarms</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the National Transportation Safety Board recently renewed efforts to get cruise ships to enhance their smoke detectors so they emit a sound in the area where smoke is found. At present, fire alarms register on the navigation bridge, and a general alarm is sounded by an officer there. The safety board said that in 1996 and 1997 fires the time elapsed led to six deaths and 77 injuries from smoke inhalation.</p>
        <p>In 1992, the International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea required that smoke detectors be installed by 1997, but not that an alarm sound in the area. In 1997, the safety board recommended the change, to no effect, and an effort before an international body earlier this year failed. Jim Hall, the safety board chairman, said that the cruise companies had failed to deal in good faith with the problem of cruise ship fires, which ''continue to occur with troubling regularity.'' The cruise line council said the sensitivity of the detectors would lead to false alarms, and passengers might ignore a real alarm. It said there were ''technical and operational drawbacks'' to the recommendations.</p>
