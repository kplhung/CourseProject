        <p>Defeat has drained his celebrated will, but David Cone could feel thousands of others trying to will him to victory yesterday, from the stands, from the Yankees' dugout. He merely held Seattle scoreless in the first inning, and Yankee Stadium fans, renowned for their mercilessness, stood and cheered earnestly, a show of tender respect that nearly moved Cone to tears.</p>
        <p>He struggled through five innings, building an awesome pitch count as he used to do with the Mets. His manager sent him to the mound for another inning, nonetheless, in the hope the Yankees would rally and Cone would win for the first time since April.</p>
        <p>Cone pitched well enough to win, but he did not pitch well; his outing had long since ended when the game was decided, when the Mariners scored three runs in the ninth and withstood Jorge Posada's homer in the bottom of the inning, his second homer of the game, and prevailed, 6-5.</p>
        <p>Cone allowed seven hits, five walks and three runs in six innings, striking out six; he has not won in his last 15 starts, and the Yankees have not won in his last 13. He threw 137 pitches, his most since delivering 147 against Seattle in Game 5 of the 1995 division series, and for that reason alone, Cone probably won't pitch in four days. Yankees Manager Joe Torre wants him to get more rest.</p>
        <p>But Cone will remain in the rotation. ''I thought he pitched fine,'' Torre said. ''I thought he got a little tentative in the middle, and he threw a lot of pitches, but he battled.''</p>
        <p>Dwight Gooden relieved Cone to start the seventh inning and shut out the Mariners into the ninth, but Seattle put together four  singles against Gooden and Mariano Rivera -- breaking a 3-3 tie on an infield single by Al Martin -- to take a 6-3 lead. Posada, who hit his 18th homer, in the seventh inning, ripped his 19th homer in the ninth, a two-run drive that cut the Mariners' lead to a run.</p>
        <p>But the Yankees lost and, again, Cone was left to explain the dynamics of a defeat. There have been times, in the 99 days since his last victory, that Cone has pitched effectively and been miserable because the Yankees lost. In the aftermath of yesterday's game, however, he seemed more at ease with the latest chapter in his summer-long plight: He felt he had battled, he said, and he was overwhelmed by how the fans and Torre reacted to him.</p>
        <p>''How many pitchers 1-10 get that kind of ovation?'' Cone asked. ''Clearly, the fans know what's going on. They showed me a lot of respect today and I appreciated that.''</p>
        <p>He needed the lift. George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, suggested July 27 that Cone be sent to Florida to work on his mechanics, hardly the standard handling of a former Cy Young award winner. The Yankees tried to acquire another starting pitcher before the July 31 trading deadline, and at the Tampa complex that day, Cone was nearly hit by a line drive and stalked off the field, the cumulative effect of his frustration. Cone met with Steinbrenner and the Yankees vice president Billy Connors that night; Cone said yesterday that Connors ''talked me off the ledge a couple of times.''</p>
        <p>Cone was well aware of the strong possibility he would be replaced in the rotation if he pitched poorly; there was no escaping that reality or the inherent pressure. But when he first walked to the bullpen to warm up, fans responded generously, loudly, and Cone raised a hand in acknowledgment. Cone was hit with another wave of cheers after he pitched the first inning.</p>
        <p>During his week with Connors, Cone made a handful of minor adjustments, compacting his delivery, keeping his hands close to his body, taking a short step back with his left foot at the outset of his motion, drawing his right hand back and firing. Everything he did was quicker: his hands, his feet, his pace. His fastball once reached 90 miles an hour.</p>
        <p>He allowed back-to-back singles in the second inning and escaped that jam with a double-play ground ball, but his recurring imprecision with his slider -- Cone's dominant pitch in past years -- hurt him again. He repeatedly reached two strikes and had trouble finishing off the Seattle hitters, and in one stretch of 13 batters, he reached a three-ball count with nine.</p>
        <p>The late-afternoon shadows reached Cone in the third, when he walked the lead-off batter and allowed a run-scoring single to Martin. Cone tried zipping a fastball over the outside corner to Alex Rodriguez but missed, and Rodriguez slugged a home run that gave Seattle a 3-2 lead. Cone's head tilted in disgust.</p>
        <p>Torre encouraged him in the dugout. The pitch counter in the right hand of the pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre read 72 after three innings, 92 after four innings, 113 after five. Cone finished the fifth with a strikeout of Mike Cameron, the 2,500th strikeout of Cone's career, and the fans used this as an excuse to stand even longer for Cone, and to beckon him for a curtain call.</p>
        <p>Cone was in the clubhouse, preparing for the sixth inning. If the Yankees had taken a lead in the bottom of the fifth, he would have been taken out. ''I was just trying to get him a win,'' Torre said.</p>
        <p>Carlos Guillen walked leading off the sixth; now the Yankees' bullpen was fully active, a left-hander and a right-hander. Cone struck out Dan Wilson with his 126th pitch. Guillen was thrown out at second on what appeared to be a botched hit-and-run, but McLemore singled. One hundred thirty-two pitches. Cone appeared exhausted.</p>
        <p>He summoned enough stuff to reach a 2-2 count on Rickey Henderson before throwing a fastball past the veteran, finishing the inning. Cone walked off in the twilight, to another ovation. He will pitch for them again, and they for him.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>The Yankees played the game under protest after Seattle Manager LOU PINIELLA told umpires that the starting pitcher, AARON SELE, was hurt and needed relief. Yankees Manager JOE TORRE argued extensively before protesting the game, perhaps upset that while the Mariners had a right-handed reliever warming up in the bullpen at the time Sele was removed, a left-hander was summoned to pitch to TINO MARTINEZ. . . . ORLANDO HERNANDEZ, who will be activated Sunday and start against the Mariners, apologized to Torre and the coaching staff for suggesting to reporters Friday that some coaches doubted the severity of his recent injuries.</p>
