        <p>Veeco Instruments Inc. of Plainview (Nasdaq: VECO) announced mixed second-quarter financial results after factoring in its $33 million acquisition of CVC Inc. this spring.</p>
        <p>Sales of $93.6 million, a second-quarter record, rose 21 percent from the year-earlier figure of $77.1 million. But operating income (excluding nonrecurring charges) was $7.8 million, down from $11.8 million. Veeco incurred inventory write-off charges of $15.3 million associated with the CVC merger.</p>
        <p>In the first half, operating income fell to $11.4 million, from $21.9 million in 1999. Net income dropped to $7.7 million, from $13.8 million. Diluted earnings were 31 cents a share, compared to 66 cents.</p>
        <p>The company attributed its decline in profits primarily to lower margins on its data storage and processing equipment.</p>
