        <p>FOR most people, applying to college is an agonizing affair, starting with anxious consultations in the spring and ending with a long-awaited letter a year later.</p>
        <p>But 18 women accomplished the whole process last week in less than four hours here at Marymount College, a four-year liberal arts college for women. Arriving in late morning, they applied, were accepted, applied for and received financial aid packages, took placement tests and even registered for their courses.</p>
        <p>Instant Admission Day may sound like a gimmick born of desperation. But it is the latest in a series of innovative recruiting strategies that have helped this and other women's colleges reverse a decades-long decline, said Irene Harwarth, an analyst at the Department of Education who has written extensively on women's colleges.</p>
        <p>Marymount has seen its enrollment grow 30 percent in the last five years. This fall's incoming class will be about 300, the largest in 25 years. The college's total enrollment is about 700, said Daniela Esposito, director of admissions at Marymount.</p>
        <p>Other women's colleges appear to be experiencing similar growth, thanks in part to efforts to reach out to nontraditional students. ''These schools are really making efforts to broaden the enrollment pool,'' Ms. Harwarth said.</p>
        <p>Lauren Humphrey, for instance, a 20-year-old from Brooklyn, might not have ended up at Marymount if not for Instant Admission Day.</p>
        <p>After dropping out of high school in 1996, she spent the last four years working, mostly at a nonprofit foundation in Manhattan. She finished her G.E.D. last year but didn't decide she wanted to apply to college until March, too late to apply to most schools. And with her job, she didn't have much time to visit campuses.</p>
        <p>She had, however, heard good things about Marymount from a colleague at work and from two of her father's friends. ''I feel kind of like I'm supposed to go here,'' she said. ''Everywhere I turn, someone's talking about Marymount.''</p>
        <p>So when she heard that Marymount allowed students to finish the whole process in one day, she decided to drive up with her mother and give it a try. ''I think it's a really good idea,'' she said. ''It's better for students, instead of having to keep coming up.''</p>
        <p>She brought only her transcript (an essay and recommendations are optional) and was accepted within an hour after meeting with Ms. Esposito. She also got a scholarship for $8,500 a year, covering a large portion of Marymount's annual $14,700 tuition.</p>
        <p>Instant Admission Day also drew some of the more conventional applicants who constitute the bulk of Marymount's student body. Elena Lopez, 17, who graduated from high school in Lawrence, Mass., in June, said she came because her plans for the coming year fell through when the National Guard suddenly postponed her basic training from August until next summer. Marymount's quick admissions process gave her a chance to fill the year.</p>
        <p>''I hardly slept, I was so nervous,'' she said of the night she spent at her uncle's place in Bridgeport before driving to Tarrytown for her interview. With a 2.5 grade point average and SAT scores of 1,015, she wasn't sure she would get in. But 45 minutes after arriving at Marymount, she had been accepted and received $4,000 in financial aid. (All 18 women who showed up for Instant Admission Day were accepted.)</p>
        <p>''I like the course of studies,'' said Ms. Lopez, who plans to major in criminal law. ''It's a small college, so the ratio's not too high -- you can actually have relationships with your teachers.''</p>
        <p>Instant Admission Day, which is advertised on radio and television, is only a small part of Marymount's recruitment drive, Ms. Esposito said. This is the first year students were able to register for classes on the spot. The college has expanded its recruitment team in the past year and has run telemarketing campaigns and on-campus events to publicize the college. Marymount tracks the number of contacts each applicant has with the college before deciding to attend. It is between 20 and 25, Ms. Esposito said, which is slightly higher than average, possibly because of a bias against single-sex education.</p>
        <p>Like most women's colleges, Marymount has tried hard to reverse that bias by telling parents, guidance counselors and potential students about the advantages of single-sex education for women. A number of studies suggest that women who graduate from single-sex colleges earn more, attain higher positions and experience more job satisfaction than their counterparts from coed colleges, Ms. Harwarth said.</p>
        <p>Those statistics have begun to overturn the view of women's colleges as prudish finishing schools where women go to escape from the world, said Elizabeth Tidball, a retired medical school professor who pioneered much of the new research on women's colleges. That view helped reduce the number of women's colleges to about 70 today from 300 in 1960.</p>
        <p>Instead, Marymount's brochures promote the school as a training ground for leadership and power, where women can speak out in class without fear of being overshadowed by men.</p>
        <p>The message appears to have reached the women who arrived for Instant Admission Day. Both Ms. Lopez and Ms. Humphrey said they thought being in a single-sex environment would help them to concentrate on their studies and achieve their goals.</p>
