      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Many readers responded to Peter Applebome's July 23 Soapbox column about racial mores and suburban manners at a gas station in Westchester County. The problem the column posed was what, if anything, to say to or do about the black gentleman sharing his expletive-laden music with the world and also Mr. Applebome's 9-year-old daughter.</p>
        <p>Here is a sampling of readers' reactions.</p>
        <p>As an African-American mother of a teenage son I found your article provocative. Do you think I want my son listening to that type of music at a light or gas station? I didn't see in your article the idea that there are parents of color who do not want their kids exposed to that stuff either!</p>

        <p>Here is a sampling of readers' reactions.</p>
        <p>As an African-American mother of a teenage son I found your article provocative. Do you think I want my son listening to that type of music at a light or gas station? I didn't see in your article the idea that there are parents of color who do not want their kids exposed to that stuff either!</p>
        <p>Isn't that racist on your part? Do you confront the co-worker who makes a remark about a Jew? Do you confront a skinhead hanging out spouting his brand of hate? Is the question here really race?</p>
        <p>Believe me, I face many more of these situations than you do. My child is also more vulnerable than yours, given the set-up of this society. What do I do? I turn it into teaching/ learning moments, which I've done from the beginning. And, F.Y.I., I have confronted armed, pit-bull-accompanied drug dealers and told them to get away from my house several times. I have experience with both approaches and I'm not sure what works best, but unlike you, I can't afford to be squeamish.</p>
