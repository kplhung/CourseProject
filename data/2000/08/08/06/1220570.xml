        <p>Joan Graham letter responds to Peter Applebome's July 30 column on loud, obscene rap music being played by man at gas pump (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Mr. Applebome writes of his reluctance to confront a black motorist about his booming rap music, but Mr. Applebome seems to have no such qualms about his gratuitous slap at the elderly. As someone who has just turned 70, I must point out that his protest that he is not ''a totally clueless, hopeless, addled, over-the-hill geezer'' points to another great divide, which he doesn't bother to hide.</p>
