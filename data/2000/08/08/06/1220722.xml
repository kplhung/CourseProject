        <p>The first noticeable difference was the uniforms, an old-style color scheme and a revived helmet logo. The next difference was the field. It was grass.</p>
        <p>And finally, even the new-look Giants offense, as pledged, was different.</p>
        <p>The Giants' reserves would later squander a first-half lead, but not before the Giants' starters made a solid opening statement in their first preseason game tonight at Giants Stadium. The first-string offense could not get the football in the end zone -- that's not new -- but the changed attack showed promise, with 215 total yards in one half.</p>
        <p>The Chicago Bears scored 17 consecutive second-half points to win, 20-8. Afterward, Giants Coach Jim Fassel was agitated by his special-teams play -- the Giants gave up a 65-yard kickoff return and a 50-yard punt return -- and glum about a knee injury to tight end Pete Mitchell that might be serious.</p>
        <p>But the Giants can focus on a host of positives.</p>
        <p>Quarterback Kerry Collins completed 15 of 18 passes for 117 yards. Most impressive, on two third-and-long plays, Collins threw over the middle to his starting wide receivers, Amani Toomer and Ike Hilliard, for gains of 29 and 20 yards, respectively.</p>
        <p>The Giants' remade offensive line played with unity and precision. A key to the Giants' regular-season hopes, the line protected Collins, who was rarely rushed in the pocket. More significant, the Giants' starting offensive line -- known in the last few seasons for its many penalties -- was whistled for just one infraction. And that was a holding penalty against the lone holdover from last year's line, right guard Ron Stone.</p>
        <p>The rookie running back Ron Dayne made a credible, steady debut, playing well into the third quarter and carrying the football 17 times for 48 yards. He also caught 2 passes for 18 yards. In one first-quarter sequence, Dayne had four consecutive rushing attempts, gaining 16 yards and picking up a third-and-1 easily with a powerful 6-yard burst off right guard.</p>
        <p>But in the second quarter, Dayne was also stopped on a third-and-1 at the Chicago 5-yard line. Tiki Barber, the Giants' starting running back tonight, stole some of Dayne's spotlight by catching 5 passes for 22 yards. Barber, perhaps the Giants' best offensive player last season, also had 4 rushes for 14 yards.</p>
        <p>Mitchell, who is being counted on in the Giants' expanded passing game, left the game with what was described as a severely sprained left knee. The Giants' initial examination of Mitchell's knee was inconclusive, and more tests are scheduled for Sunday. ''It doesn't look good with him walking around on crutches,'' Collins said. ''It's something they want to take a closer look at. The worst-case scenario, that would be tough to lose him for the season.''</p>
        <p>Fassel was not happy afterward either, particularly with his special teams. ''Our coverage teams were pretty disappointing,'' the coach said. ''We did some good things -- on offense we moved the ball -- but I'm disappointed in those other aspects.''</p>
        <p>One of the preseason goals for Fassel and his new offensive coordinator, Sean Payton, has been better balance to the offense. And in the first half, the Giants threw the football 18 times and ran it 17 times.</p>
        <p>And while Fassel maintained he would not reveal any tricks because the Giants play the Bears in September, midway through the second quarter the Giants ran a double reverse. The rookie wide receiver Ron Dixon ended up with the ball and gained 17 yards.</p>
        <p>The Giants may have sometimes looked like their old selves -- the first play of the game was a 1-yard run by Barber -- but, tellingly, the next two plays were passes, including the first of five first-half first downs picked up through the air when Collins connected with tight end Howard Cross on a 10-yard pass.</p>
        <p>That drive would stall, but the Giants' next possession lasted for 12 plays and opened the scoring when Brad Daluiso kicked a 37-yard field goal. This was the series that included Dayne's four successive carries, but the big play was Collins's crisp 20-yard pass to Hilliard on a third-and-10. The Bears tied the game with a 24-yard field goal by Jaret Holmes, but the Giants then drove to the Bears' 5-yard line. This is where Dayne lost a yard on a third-and-1. The Giants decided to go for a first down on fourth-and-2, but Collins's pass to the corner of the end zone for Hilliard was knocked away by Chicago's Jerry Azumah.</p>
        <p>On the next play, from Chicago's 6-yard line, Giants defensive tackle Christian Peter registered a safety by barreling into Bears quarterback Jim Miller as he was trying to pass in the end zone.</p>
        <p>Peter's play was not the only big one for the Giants' defense tonight. The rookie defensive tackle Cornelius Griffin, who is fighting for Peter's job, had two sacks. Middle linebacker Pete Monty, starting for Mike Barrow, who sat out the game with a slightly sprained knee, had four first-half tackles, including two crushing stops on third downs.</p>
        <p>The Giants' secondary survived the absence of free safety Shaun Williams, although Chicago quarterback Cade McNown was hardly having his best game and wide receiver Dez White dropped a pass deep down the sideline that might have led to a Bears score.</p>
        <p>The Giants lost their 8-3 first-half lead when Mark Hartsell, in relief of McNown, threw a 3-yard touchdown pass to Macey Brooks in the third quarter. Chicago later extended that lead to 13-8 on a 43-yard field goal by the rookie kicker Paul Edinger.</p>
        <p>The Giants' second- and third-string offenses and defenses -- and their special teams -- were largely ineffective the rest of the game. A 50-yard punt return by R. W. McQuarters set up the Bears' fourth-quarter touchdown, a 17-yard pass from quarterback Clint Dolezel to fullback Scott Dragos.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Running back JOE MONTGOMERY did not dress for the game because of a cut lip. . . . Safety SAM GARNES, who had to go to the hospital when he was hit in the throat during Wednesday's practice, continued to be among the most durable Giants and started the game. . . . The first permanent grass field inside Giants Stadium seemed to provide solid footing for the players.</p>
