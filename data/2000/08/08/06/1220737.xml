        <p>A study in The Journal of the American Medical Association says there is no evidence the 1994 Brady Law, which mandates background checks of handgun buyers, has contributed to the recent sharp decline in homicide.</p>
        <p>That is music to the ears of the National Rifle Association, which argues that laws don't stop criminals from getting guns.</p>
        <p>But gun control advocates say the study is flawed, and even the study's authors acknowledge that a major reason the Brady law may not have  been effective is its limited scope.</p>
