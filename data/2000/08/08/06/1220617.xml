        <p>Patients at White Plains Hospital Center can now open their own Web pages to let family members know how they're doing. A Manhattan-based company, VisitingOurs.com, is spending $40,000 to build nine computer kiosks around the hospital with access to its Web site, which can also be visited from any computer with Internet service.</p>
        <p>To create a page, a patient or family member simply enters personal information and the names of the people the patient wants to give access to. Users can also buy gifts for the patient by way of links to retailers.</p>
