        <p>SUSAN ESTRICH, the manager of Michael S. Dukakis's unsuccessful 1988 campaign for president, was rattling off ways Al Gore could use the Democratic convention to rebut George W. Bush's accomplished performance last week when she stopped short and laughed at herself. ''Most people won't be listening to any of this!'' she exclaimed.</p>
        <p>Ms. Estrich may be on to something. It is true that Mr. Bush went a long way toward achieving two essential goals: to recast the Republican Party's image as sunny, nonthreatening and compassionate, and to demonstrate that he was not the untested political ingenue that the Democrats have labeled him.</p>
        <p>But equally significant, at least as far as Mr. Gore is concerned, was Mr. Bush's success at orchestrating a convention that was uncontroversial and, for the most part, dull. At a time when public interest in political conventions is already in decline, the G.O.P. convention may have in effect been an anticommercial -- Don't Watch This! -- for Mr. Gore's convention next Monday in Los Angeles. Mr. Gore is getting a lot of advice on what he should do to spark his campaign, but it's not going to help his already uphill effort if no one is watching.</p>
        <p>Even if the convention didn't draw many viewers, its essential message -- a blurring of ideological differences between Republicans and Democrats -- was seeping out. A candidate doesn't have to be watched to be effective. As recent interviews with the voting public have made clear, it's not how many were watching but who: the opinions of those who do watch filter down to the public at large. Others turn to news coverage on television and in local newspapers. Convention viewership, however, was generally lower than in 1996.</p>
        <p>To be sure, Mr. Bush delivered a lively acceptance speech, and Dick Cheney, his running mate, went on the attack. But dissent was so discouraged that hours would slog by without any indication that this was a partisan gathering, much less a Republican one. The production, often as relentlessly upbeat as a Pepsi commercial, sent million of potential viewers (and potential voters) scurrying to find more compelling fare on television.</p>
        <p>The Republican convention was important to Mr. Bush, who entered it ahead in the polls, but the Democratic convention is crucial for Mr. Gore's hopes of moving from his residence on the grounds of the Naval Observatory to the White House next January. The gathering next week is likely to be one of the last high-profile opportunities that this very familiar political figure has to get voters to reconsider him, outside of the expected debates. Oddly, it is now Mr. Gore, who has spent a lifetime in government service, rather than Mr. Bush, who is in the position of having to make the speech of his life.</p>
        <p>The issue of viewership aside, there is no shortage of advice on what Mr. Gore should do and say once he gets to Los Angeles. Indeed, there is a surprising amount of agreement among Democrats and Republicans alike.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Bush needed to demonstrate that he had both intellect and an engaging personality, Mr. Gore probably needs to show the reverse: to demonstrate that he is something else than the brainy if drab No. 2 who has stood off to the side of the national stage for the past eight years. Accordingly, Mr. Gore's campaign has assembled a heavy package of biographical tributes (Mr. Gore, you will learn, served in Vietnam) in their undying hope that to know Mr. Gore is to like him.</p>
        <p>Beyond that, the orchestrated fluffiness of the Republican convention is being seized by Mr. Gore's advisers as a tactical mistake. And in response, a strategy is taking shape.</p>
        <p>''Given that the Republican convention avoided issues, we ought to have an issues-oriented convention,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, the New York Democrat. ''And everything should be related to prosperity. I am of the view that that is our strongest suit. And I would pound that theme in.''</p>
        <p>AND that is what Mr. Gore is intending to do. His advisers say convention speakers in Los Angeles, and the vice president as he campaigns en route, will offer detailed discussions of one Democratic initiative each day, starting with Social Security. They are already encouraging reporters to draw contrasts to what they describe -- with a touch of envy -- as Mr. Bush's ''cotton-candy convention.''</p>
        <p>The risk is that this might evoke an image of Mr. Gore as the dreary, pedantic candidate at a blackboard, holding a piece of chalk. That said, Mr. Gore may not have much choice.  ''Bush has a more appealing personality than Gore and the Republicans have put on an appealing convention in terms of image,'' said William Kristol, the publisher of the conservative Weekly Standard. ''They need desperately to make this a campaign about issues, rather than image. And here they have been given something of an opening.''</p>
        <p>Beyond that, Mr. Gore's advisers are taking solace in the fact that Mr. Bush spoke first, giving Mr. Gore the last word. For example, in what was probably the central political formulation of Mr. Bush's speech, the Republican argued that President Clinton and Mr. Gore squandered eight years of prosperity. It opened the way for Mr. Gore to respond with what his aides asserted was abundant evidence to the contrary -- as well as to remind voters of what the economy was like under the George Bush who preceded Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>''Gore now has an opportunity,'' said Michael McCurry, the former White House press secretary under Mr. Clinton. ''They're going to have to go back and remind people of what they've done for the past eight years.''</p>
        <p>The other George Bush, by the way, was in the convention hall almost as often as the most conscientious delegate, sitting in a V.I.P. section that included a who's who of Republican warhorses: among them, 87-year-old Gerald Ford, former cabinet officials under Presidents Bush and Reagan and Mr. Cheney, who served as defense secretary under Mr. Bush's father. This aging if distinguished tableau of power offers another point of contrast that Mr. Gore intends to make at the convention.</p>
        <p>''The mistake they made is the they posited themselves in the past,''  said Rahm Emanuel, an adviser to both Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore. ''And that's from the moment of the Cheney selection forward. The thematic of the campaign is future versus past.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore is well aware, an aide said, that none of this will matter if no one is there to hear his tree fall. His campaign has begun to try to deal with that: Mr. Gore will, for example, do hard-driving, telegenic events during the day intended to get him on the network news, and is considering a range of interviews with unusual sources, from MTV to Jay Leno, reminiscent of what Mr. Clinton did in 1992. The daytime events are designed to get the vice president on the television news every night, with the convention serving as something of a late-evening coda that reinforces the message of the day.</p>
        <p>THE challenge for Mr. Gore now is grabbing the the public's attention. Even someone like Ms. Estrich who has lived and breathed politics for more than 20 years had little interest in tuning into the high point of the Republican convention, Mr. Bush's speech. In the midst of an interview last Thursday, she noted that she had arranged to have drinks that night with another Democrat involved in planning Mr. Gore's convention. Their appointment, she said, was scheduled at the time Mr. Bush would take the stage to offer his vision for the presidency.</p>
        <p>''Watch his speech?'' she said. ''Why? I'll watch a clip in the morning.''</p>
