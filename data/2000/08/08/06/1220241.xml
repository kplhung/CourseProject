        <p>LUCIFER'S LEGACY</p>
        <p>The Meaning of Asymmetry.</p>
        <p>By Frank Close.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 259 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Oxford University Press. $27.50.</p>
        <p>When the Pakistani physicist Abdus Salam wanted to explain the tantalizing notion of broken symmetry, one of the key ideas in particle physics, he would invoke the image of diners seated at a circular table. Between the settings are salad plates -- a perfectly symmetrical situation that presents each guest with a problem. Which plate to use, left or right? There is no compelling reason to prefer one over the other. But once one diner has arbitrarily made a choice, the effect ripples around the table, with each guest forced to abide by the decision. The symmetry is broken.</p>
        <p>A pencil balancing on its tip randomly falls in a certain direction, a droplet of water crystallizes into a snowflake shaped in one of many possible hexagonal forms -- both illustrate the notion of broken symmetry. The universe, viewed as a limbo of pure potentiality, is a place of perfect harmony. But the delicate balance is constantly being upset, giving rise to the specifics of the real world.</p>
        <p>In his gracefully written book, ''Lucifer's Legacy: The Meaning of Asymmetry,'' the physicist Frank Close explores this concept, beginning with a visit to the Tuileries Gardens in Paris. After admiring the fidelity with which each side of the path -- each garden, fountain and statue -- mirrors the other, Close is surprised to come across a damaged figure of Lucifer with his head broken off and lying on the ground. Across the way, Lucifer's clone is intact, inspiring Close to take the interrupted pattern of the garden as his book's reigning metaphor. Like the ancient Gnostics, science sees the material world as a flawed creation, a fall from the grace of mathematical perfection.</p>
        <p>The belief sometimes seems almost mystical. Physicists theorize that at the moment of creation there was a single superforce that split into the four very different forces experienced today: gravity, electromagnetism and the weak and strong nuclear forces. In the earliest moments, one perfect ethereal substance shattered into the diverse spray of particles that make up matter. The resulting universe is imbued with hints of a corrupted primal geometry, riddled with broken symmetries.</p>
        <p>The consolation, for Close, is that in a perfectly symmetrical world, we wouldn't exist. In the beginning, creation consisted of almost equal doses of matter and antimatter. When these two substances came together they annihilated each other. Had the balance between the two been exact, the universe would have destroyed itself. But the symmetry was slightly askew, ensuring that something was left for us to contemplate.</p>
        <p>These ideas have been explored in other popular books, like A. Zee's ''Fearful Symmetry: The Search for Beauty in Modern Physics'' and Heinz R. Pagels's ''Perfect Symmetry: The Search for the Beginning of Time.'' Close breaks little new ground, but his rendition is among the best. He explores puzzles like why a mirror seems to reverse left and right but not up and down, or whether water really swirls down the drain in opposite directions north and south of the Equator. (In one of his funnier passages, he describes an inconclusive experiment involving the lavatory basin on a plane from England to South Africa.)</p>
        <p>Close also branches out into molecular biology, contemplating how organic molecules come in right- and left-handed versions, mirror-image structures with different chemical properties. Limone molecules, he tells us, smell like oranges or lemons depending on whether they are left- or right-handed. Though there are mirror forms of DNA, life on earth is made exclusively from the left-handed variety. Is this broken symmetry an accident locked in by evolution, or was the left-handed DNA seeded on earth from outer space?</p>
        <p>These speculations bring Close about a third of the way into his book. From there he uses symmetry as a device for a whirlwind tour of modern particle physics, starting with the discovery of X-rays in 1895 and ending with the puzzles of superstring theory, the leading candidate for the ultimate theory of matter and energy.</p>
        <p>Physics differs from theology in an important way: theorists must provide precise mechanisms for vague ideas like symmetry-breaking, and experimenters must find hints that the mechanisms exist. Close ends with a discussion of a hypothetical particle called the Higgs boson, which is believed to be responsible for causing the original superforce to split apart and for bestowing the subatomic particles with a hodgepodge of different masses. This symmetry-breaking particle will be avidly sought when a powerful new particle accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider, comes on line several years from now in Geneva. Leon Lederman, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist, considers the Higgs so important to creation that he nicknamed it the God particle. It might better be called the Lucifer particle: the embodiment of randomness constantly upsetting a world that would otherwise be too perfect and orderly to exist.</p>
