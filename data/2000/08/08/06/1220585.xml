        <p>Sometimes it just doesn't pay to have good advertising. The Wildwood Tourism calendar lists several events for the weekend of Aug. 26 and 27. Unfortunately, two of the major ones -- Oktoberfest by the Sea and the Wildwood Millennium Blues Festival -- aren't happening, and never were supposed to happen, at least on those dates.</p>
        <p>Main Street Wildwood, the nonprofit downtown development organization whose phone number is listed beside the alleged Aug. 26-27 events, will indeed play host to the Blues Festival, but on Oct. 6 and 7, on Holly Beach Mall. But the Oktoberfest, like the Doo-Wop Festival last month, is off.</p>

        <p>Sometimes it just doesn't pay to have good advertising. The Wildwood Tourism calendar lists several events for the weekend of Aug. 26 and 27. Unfortunately, two of the major ones -- Oktoberfest by the Sea and the Wildwood Millennium Blues Festival -- aren't happening, and never were supposed to happen, at least on those dates.</p>
        <p>Main Street Wildwood, the nonprofit downtown development organization whose phone number is listed beside the alleged Aug. 26-27 events, will indeed play host to the Blues Festival, but on Oct. 6 and 7, on Holly Beach Mall. But the Oktoberfest, like the Doo-Wop Festival last month, is off.</p>
        <p>The Main Street Wildwood executive director, Mike Porch, said all three festivals had been supported by downtown businesses for the last several years, but the manpower to put them on this year was just not there. They were apparently placed on the calendar and on billboards along the Boardwalk because they seemed to be annual events. Mr. Porch said he was prepared for people to come downtown on the August weekend looking for the Blues Festival, just as they did for the Doo-Wop Festival, but hopeds they will come back in October.</p>
        <p>''It will be a fun event,'' Mr. Porch said. ''I just hope everyone is flexible and comes back again in October.''</p>
