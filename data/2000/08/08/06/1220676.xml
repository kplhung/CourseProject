        <p>Some of the victims, like Joann Feliciano and Vivian Caraballo, knew each other. They would hang out together on South Fourth Street in Williamsburg, stopping in to see friends or sitting on a stoop, sometimes late into the night, as they scrounged for money to buy drugs.</p>
        <p>Katrina Niles met Patricia Sullivan at a housing project in Bedford-Stuyvesant, and the two had been friends for 10 years. Like Ms. Feliciano and Ms. Caraballo, both were drug users, and their lives had spiraled out of control because of their addictions. Rhonda Tucker, who lived in another housing project in Bedford-Stuyvesant, battled mental illness, and spent her days watching television or sitting in a nearby park.</p>
        <p>Until the police on Friday arrested a homeless man, Vincent Johnson, in  their deaths, the five women -- all poor and black or Hispanic -- shared a kind of invisibility. The police said three of the slain women had been arrested on prostitution charges, but they declined to say which ones. A sixth victim was tentatively identified yesterday as Laura G. Nusser.</p>
        <p>Troubled as many of the victims were, there was the sense among their relatives and friends that their lives and deaths had been cast in a marginal light.</p>
        <p>''No matter what these people did, they were human beings,'' said Salimah Malik, 31, who lives in Marcy Houses in Bedford-Stuyvesant, where Mrs. Sullivan, 48, had lived and where Ms. Niles, who was homeless, had often stayed with a friend.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Sullivan, who was found strangled on June 22 in a vacant lot about four blocks from her home, was a former teacher's assistant who had planned to become a teacher. But nine years ago her youngest son, Laquan, died suddenly at age 2 from complications of asthma, and she gave up teaching and her studies, said her husband, Glenn A. Sullivan, 51. ''The loss hit her hard,'' he said.</p>
        <p>It was then that Mrs. Sullivan  turned to drugs, members of her family said.</p>
        <p>''I was always concerned about her, but she was the strongest person I knew,'' said her son Shawn Martinez, 31. ''I would have never imagined what actually happened to her would happen.''</p>
        <p>Joann Feliciano, 35, was found strangled on the roof of 171 South Fourth Street in Williamsburg on Sept. 16, 1999. She lived a block away with her mother, Maria Feliciano, a native of Puerto Rico and a retired factory worker.</p>
        <p>Ms. Feliciano grew up in the close-knit neighborhood of Puerto Ricans and Dominicans. She attended Eastern District High School but dropped out and married at 17, her mother said. She had a son, now 19 and living in Puerto Rico. Her family called her Bright Eyes because she had piercing blue eyes, her mother said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Feliciano's friends and neighbors were aware of her drug problem, but they described her as quiet and friendly, and said she often spoke of trying to end her addiction.</p>
        <p>''She was really nice and easy to get along with,'' said Jimmy Perez, 35, who attended junior high and high school with her. But he said her life began to fall apart when she started using drugs years ago.</p>
        <p>Maria Feliciano said she had constantly tried to persuade her daughter to stop using drugs. ''She wanted to take the wrong way and nobody could stop her,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Less than a month before Joann  Feliciano was killed, Vivian Caraballo, 26, who lived nearby on South Second Street, became the first victim. Her body was found on Aug. 26, 1999, in the elevator room on the roof of her building. Ms. Caraballo lived with her mother and a son, neighbors said, and kept mostly to herself.</p>
        <p>Ms. Niles was found strangled with an electrical cord and with her throat slashed in the apartment of a friend, Clarence Girard. He said Ms. Niles was divorced and was struggling with drug addiction.</p>
        <p>Mr. Girard said he did not know how Mr. Johnson, the suspect, had met Ms. Niles.</p>
        <p>Residents of the Marcy Houses, where Mrs. Sullivan lived and where Ms. Niles's body was found, said they had seen him several times. At the Sumner Houses in Bedford-Stuyvesant, where Ms. Tucker, 21, was found strangled in her apartment on Sept. 25, 1999, residents said they had seen him regularly.</p>
        <p>Ms. Tucker lived with her 7-year-old daughter and her parents and had decided a few days before she was killed to begin studying for the high school equivalency test, her relatives said.</p>
        <p>Two weeks ago, Maria Feliciano left her apartment in Williamsburg for a stroll, as she does every day around noon after watching a Spanish soap opera.</p>
        <p>On this day, she walked for seven blocks and, at Marcy Avenue and Broadway, saw a familiar face. She said it was Mr. Johnson, whom she had often seen on the streets of Williamsburg, pushing a grocery cart filled with clothing and cans.</p>
        <p>He asked her for a quarter, saying, ''Miss, please, I'm hungry,'' recalled Ms. Feliciano. She decided to give him a dollar and told him to get himself something healthful to eat.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, after learning that Mr. Johnson was the suspect in her daughter's murder, Ms. Feliciano was haunted by the moment.</p>
        <p>''I fed my own enemy,'' she said.</p>
