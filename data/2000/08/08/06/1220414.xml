        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Karen Schoemer's well-written profile of the Jayhawks [''What If You Made a Classic, and No One Cared?,'' July 23] paints an unduly pessimistic picture of rock 'n' roll's prospects. Given the band's bitterness about its tepid commercial success, it seems to be missing the point as well. Ms. Schoemer asserts that rock 'n' roll has rarely been lower on the cultural radar. In fact, by many accounts, smart, accessible rock is enjoying a renaissance, albeit not in the multiplatinum stratosphere both she and the band seem to covet. Groups like Belle and Sebastian, Elliott Smith, Wilco and Ben Folds Five have enjoyed considerable success in the fertile ground between indie obscurity and the top of the pops.</p>

        <p>Karen Schoemer's well-written profile of the Jayhawks [''What If You Made a Classic, and No One Cared?,'' July 23] paints an unduly pessimistic picture of rock 'n' roll's prospects. Given the band's bitterness about its tepid commercial success, it seems to be missing the point as well. Ms. Schoemer asserts that rock 'n' roll has rarely been lower on the cultural radar. In fact, by many accounts, smart, accessible rock is enjoying a renaissance, albeit not in the multiplatinum stratosphere both she and the band seem to covet.

        <p>Serious, smart pop music has always made only cameo appearances on the charts. Although we tend to look back to a golden age when the top 40 was crowded with genius -- the Stones, the Beatles, Hendrix, Dylan -- the sad fact is that even then these were islands in a sea of bubble gum. With a few shining exceptions, serious musicians cashed in their 15 minutes and went on to either self-destruct or do what actually matters: make good music at a smaller scale for people who actually listen. Ms. Schoemer's point that most of the bubble gum on the pop charts these days isn't rock 'n' roll-flavored (arguably a long-overdue diversification) is well taken, but as the Jayhawks and their good company make clear, rock 'n' roll is doing just fine, thank you very much.</p>
