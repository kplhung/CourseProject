        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It never ceases to amaze me how much passionate correspondence the serialist debate still engenders. Wronged composers, angry listeners, defenders of the faith swirl around in a repetitive glaze, strangely reminiscent of the minimalist music that once challenged and now supplants the evil empire of academic composition (to be done in itself by New Romanticism, New Tonality -- whoever and whatever it is that tops this week's Arts &amp; Leisure section). Reading through the letters of July 23, one hears the faint echo of Berlioz's unsurpassed opening: ''Another Italian Opera is being given, etc. etc.''</p>
        <p>In an era where a college student who knows three chords on guitar is a musician, and one who knows six is a genius, contemporary art music of whatever type will only be seen as elitist, snobby, politically incorrect, too complex, long and boring -- precisely those terms we use to denigrate the classical music of our enemies. I guess we agree on something.</p>

        <p>In an era where a college student who knows three chords on guitar is a musician, and one who knows six is a genius, contemporary art music of whatever type will only be seen as elitist, snobby, politically incorrect, too complex, long and boring -- precisely those terms we use to denigrate the classical music of our enemies. I guess we agree on something.</p>
        <p>While one might take the continued and heated debate as a sign of vitality -- that classical music still means something to many (and to this we should be grateful) -- the more likely interpretation is that a lot of listeners hate Schoenberg. In either case, the merry-go-round of empty polemic no longer enlightens or endears. To the listeners who walk out in a huff after the first chord, you make fine role models for the next generation. For the rest of us, there is much work to do and it is time to move on.</p>
