        <p>GRAF-Shirley, A life-long New Yorker of 82 years and integral part of the city's entertainment industry, news industry, and city government died Wednesday. Before retiring in 1983 she served the City of New York as an exective in the office of budget, spanning the administrations of Lindsay through Koch. In 1948 Shirley ''went on the road'' with Gloria Swanson, traveling with her summer stock show and ghostwriting a newspaper column under Swanson's byline. Her three nephews, Jeff, Ron, and Mike Graf, survive her. Burial services will be held in Mt. Hebron Cemetery, Flushing. For details: 302-798-6119, or www. greysnapper.com/shirley.html</p>
