        <p>Editorial deplores continuing prominent role of soft money in US election campaigns, holding soft money has been making mockery of post-Watergate campaign finance laws ever since political moneymen discovered loophole that allowed unlimited contributions to political parties, as opposed to $1,000 limit on donations to individual candidates</p>

        <p>There were two parallel conventions in Philadelphia last week, one a televised coronation of the Republican ticket inside the First Union Center, the other an endless parade of off-camera fund-raising events in hotel suites, private clubs and restaurants throughout the city. In these genteel settings and others -- including a string of private railroad cars provided by the Union Pacific Railroad and a quiet Pennsylvania trout stream, where House Speaker Dennis Hastert found that donors were biting more readily than the fish -- corporations and wealthy individuals unloaded millions of dollars in an effort to buy influence with a Bush-Cheney administration and with Republicans in the next Congress.</p>
        <p>The Republicans, of course, are not alone in their addiction to the soft money that has come to dominate the modern campaign environment. Vice President Al Gore and the Democrats will engage in much the same tawdry exercise when they convene in Los Angeles next week. But it is worth pausing for a moment to reflect on the G.O.P.'s week of excess, not least because of the hypocrisy it exposes.</p>
        <p>The convention hall was full of talk about political morality, about restoring decency and respect and integrity to the Oval Office, code words for not only President Clinton's personal lapses but also his casual abuse of the White House -- the private coffees, the renting out of the Lincoln bedroom and all the other tacky devices he and Vice President Gore used to underwrite their political futures. But like so much else at this convention, there was a big gap between words and reality, and while the words promised reform, the reality was the spectacle of huge sums of money changing hands. Among other things, this conclave marked the emergence of a new group of superdonors known as Republican Regents, wealthy individuals and corporations that have given at least $250,000 in the election cycle that began in January 1999. This elite cadre now consists of 139 members whose largesse makes the 600 or so members of Gov. George W. Bush's Team 100 ($100,000 minimum) look like pikers. With checkbooks like these floating around town, little wonder that the Republican National Committee was able to raise $10 million at a single lunch on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The Democrats have their equivalent, the Leadership 2000 contributors ($350,000 and up) and the Jefferson Trust (at least $100,000). At the moment, the Republicans are ahead, having raised $137 million by the end of June. But with three lucrative months to go, the two parties together  are on pace to raise a half-billion dollars, about double the $260 million in soft money raised four years ago.</p>
        <p>Soft money has been making a mockery of the post-Watergate campaign finance laws ever since the political moneymen discovered a loophole that allowed unlimited contributions to the political parties, as opposed to the $1,000 limit on donations to individual candidates. It is these huge contributions that now dominate the political environment, poisoning the legislative system, turning the national committees into giant shakedown operations and the nation's lawmakers into full-time mendicants. Many corporations are coming to hate this system and about 30 have broken with it. But plenty of others came to Philadelphia with open arms and open bars. Even those that no longer write checks, like Time Warner, throw lavish parties and, in the case of General Motors, provide limousines and other ''in-kind'' services.</p>
        <p>The simple truth of the matter is this. The morality and integrity that Dick Cheney and Governor Bush invoked so easily last week will never become a reality in Washington until the present campaign fund-raising system is destroyed. Mr. Bush and the Republican platform both promise to end soft-money donations from corporations and labor unions. But they say nothing about the big individual donors, whose contributions account for at least half of the soft money the party and its various fund-raising arms have taken in so far. To his credit, Mr. Gore has promised to shut down individual gifts as well.</p>
        <p>It was reassuring to hear John McCain, who  did not mention campaign reform in his address to the convention, tell a television interviewer later that he would ''tie up'' the Senate until it approved the bill he has co-sponsored with Senator Russell Feingold to end soft money. ''We will have blood all over the floor,'' he said, ''until we accede to the demands of the American people to be represented in Washington again.'' These are noble, fighting words. But what reform really needs is a president, any president, who will go to bat for it. This addiction runs deep.</p>
