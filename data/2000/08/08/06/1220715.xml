        <p>THEY busted him in the shower. It was a gambit right out of ''The Sopranos,'' collaring a man when he is most vulnerable, soaping himself and singing ''Con Te Partiro,'' and thinking he's a regular Andrea Boccelli.</p>
        <p>After he was dried and dressed and escorted -- polite term -- to headquarters, Robert E. Brennan, once a very huge name in thoroughbred racing and investment circles, was charged with criminal fraud.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors say that in 1995 Brennan cashed in $500,000 in gambling chips but did not turn the money over to a trustee, who had been appointed after Brennan had declared bankruptcy a month earlier.</p>
        <p>Brennan has denied the charge, and several friends of his, including a former football coach by the name of Parcells, sprung for the bail of $500,000.</p>
        <p>People are loyal to Bob Brennan, including Dennis Diaz, who in 1985 opted for a $2 million bonus to race the Kentucky Derby champion he owned, Spend a Buck, in an arriviste event labeled the Jersey Derby at the racetrack Brennan owned, Garden State Park, rather than honor the tradition of the Triple Crown.</p>
        <p>Despite thumbing his long and handsome nose at the establishment, Spend a Buck wound up earning $3,552,704, the highest annual income ever in racing at that point, earned the Eclipse Award as Horse of the Year, and then retired.</p>
        <p>Diaz was busy monitoring the stock market from his Florida home Friday, but he found time to speak well of Brennan.</p>
        <p>''We had no relationship other than in racing that year,'' Diaz hastened to note. ''He was a heck of a nice guy, a very nice person, candid and honest. I had no bad experience with him. I read a story about him on the Internet, and that's really all I know, but I'm just sorry he's going through whatever he's going through.''</p>
        <p>Fair enough after 15 years, but Diaz surely cannot forget the buzz when Brennan came courting in his helicopter. There was an exciting whiff of marginality to Brennan's penny-stock dealing, more specific than the whispers that followed another charmer named Jay Gatsby to his new digs in East Egg.</p>
        <p>Greed has been around forever, but there are moments when it seems to be getting worse -- in the houses of cards of the dot-com world, the manic faces of Wall Street traders, the feeding frenzy of Manhattan apartment speculators, the scorched-earth zeal of bankers, lawyers, real-estate agents and developers who would squeeze gauche little houses into corners of suburbia.</p>
        <p>For his part, Brennan was the spiritual godfather of those pests who call us at home with stock offers. He made it sound almost patriotic, proclaiming ''Come grow with us,'' as if he were some kind of latter-day Franklin or Jefferson.</p>
        <p>Eventually, a federal judge in New York called Brennan ''a big crook'' for his actions with First Jersey Securities, then a symbol of opulence, now quite terminally defunct, along with the aspirations and savings of his followers.</p>
        <p>This was the fellow who was going to transform racing, a sport particularly open to new blood because all it takes is one good year at the various gaming tables of life to buy a horse or even a racetrack.</p>
        <p>Brennan, like Diaz, knew he would never be accepted by the crusty racing establishment, so he played on twisted populist urges like a Trump of the mainland. Talking about being one of nine children, growing up in an apartment in Newark, he called racing ''an elitist sport,'' saying he wanted to make it ''clean, healthy and wholesome.''</p>
        <p>Often he said, ''In this country we can still dream.''</p>
        <p>His dream was to land his noisy helicopter smack in the middle of the 1985 Belmont, which he had scorned by leaving Spend a Buck home. They waved him off, telling him to land on the fringe of the complex, but later that day he proclaimed how much he was doing for racing by subverting the Triple Crown.</p>
        <p>''What we're doing,'' he lectured, ''is a great argument for a racetrack run by the private sector, rather than a quasi-governmental agency.''</p>
        <p>And he added, ''I don't believe in accepting mediocrity just because it's always been accepted.''</p>
        <p>It sounded good for a month or two, but eventually he went back to his real life. This is the first time Brennan has been charged with a crime, investigators being cautious about indictments in the P. T. Barnum sucker-born-every-minute world of penny stocks.</p>
        <p>Brennan is not the first sports official to run afoul of the law. In recent years, Bruce McNall, the man who owned Wayne Gretzky, so to speak, has gone away for improperly dealing in valuable coins, and John Spano, a temporary owner of the Islanders, went to jail for being a wannabe millionaire. And one recalls the campaign contribution problems of a certain George M. Steinbrenner III, who ultimately required a pardon from President Reagan.</p>
        <p>Several executives in Salt Lake City are in big trouble for greasing delegates of the International Olympic Committee. In Australia, Olympic officials were funneling tickets to friends. In soccer, South Africa recently lost a close election to Germany for the right to hold the 2006 World Cup, when one delegate abstained, extremely suspiciously.</p>
        <p>Given his gall, Robert E. Brennan would have been right at home in international sport. In calling for high bail, one assistant United States attorney cited Brennan's expensive tastes, his trips by private jets and helicopters, and allegations he has money hidden overseas. There was even talk of a French girlfriend, which means he must be guilty of something.</p>
        <p>Now Brennan is home in New Jersey, presumably tethered by his high bail, courtesy of his friends, including the football coach. Who wants Bill Parcells mad at him for skipping bail? For the moment, Robert E. Brennan is back to taking showers without getting busted, and that's progress.</p>
