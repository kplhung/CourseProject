        <p>Gene Busnar letter responds to Peter Applebome's July 23 column on loud, obscene rap music being played by man pumping gas (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>A column July 23 by Peter Applebome described a situation at a gas station in which he and his 9-year-old daughter were exposed to loud rap music with X-rated lyrics booming from the car of a black man wearing a prison guard uniform. He debated asking the man to turn the music down but decided not to. He asked readers what they would do. Here is a sampling of the many responses.</p>
        <p>Under the circumstances, it would have been foolhardy to pretend that race didn't matter. Had you told the black prison guard to turn down the music, he surely would have noticed that you were white. His response to your request is another matter. Perhaps he has young kids of his own, and would have understood your concern. But the same response (saying nothing) would have been the wise choice if the offensive music was coming from a white punk's tape deck. Why risk an altercation with someone you'll never see again? No matter what you do to shield your daughter, she will eventually find out that there are tougher realities than the most vulgar rap lyrics, even in the cushy suburbs.</p>
