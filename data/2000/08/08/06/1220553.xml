        <p>In a new effort to put public toilets on New York streets, the City Council has set aside $5 million in its latest budget for 50 or more high-tech toilets.</p>
        <p>Peter F. Vallone, the City Council speaker, said he hoped the first ones would be installed by the end of next year. ''Everything else will fall into place.''</p>
        <p>Exactly how that will happen is too early to tell; no city agency has yet taken responsibility for the project.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vallone said earlier efforts had linked public toilets with other street amenities like bus shelters and news kiosks. This time, the idea is simply to install toilets.</p>
        <p>Under the last proposal for public toilets, in 1996, private companies were to pay for installing and maintaining toilets in exchange for lucrative advertising franchises in kiosks and shelters, as well as in the toilets themselves.</p>
        <p>Opponents, however, said city residents were already assaulted by too much advertising and raised concerns about safety and potential misuse as well as about access for the disabled.</p>
        <p>Steven Stollman, a self-described toilet advocate, pointed out that the previous proposal had envisioned  units that opened automatically after 20 minutes to discourage misuse. But, he said: ''Twenty minutes is a long time to do lots of stuff. Two people can go in there and have sex. Or do dope.''</p>
        <p>City officials note that if the toilets in the new proposal are too large, there will be limits on where they can be placed without creating sidewalk congestion.</p>
        <p>Douglas Lasdon, executive director of the Urban Justice Center, who wrote a paper in 1990 about the city's lack of public toilets that is credited with jump-starting the debate, said it would be a ''colossal bad idea'' for the city to proceed without thinking through maintenance issues.</p>
        <p>Councilman Walter L. McCaffrey, who supports the new effort, said maintenance would be addressed later. He said he thought that the fact that the money was there meant ''this project will move forward.''</p>
