        <p>The red bell and orange tentacles of the lion's mane jellyfish -- most common to New Jersey and other locations along the East Coast -- stir fear and awe as it gracefully pulses with the currents.</p>
        <p>The animal is hardly the thorniest of the ocean's beautiful blossoms, yet for those allergic to the sting of its protein-based toxins or unfortunate enough to be struck in the eye by the microscopic harpoons on its  tentacles, death and injury can result.</p>
        <p>In step with its annual visits, the lion's mane -- known formally as Cyanea capillata -- is beginning to appear off the Jersey Shore in greater numbers. But for such a seasonal regular, the jellyfish has come under remarkably little scrutiny. And by the end of the Labor Day weekend, it will drift from memory like a pair of lost sunglasses.</p>
        <p>Even scientists limit their studies of jellyfish to the summer, when the waters are warm and calm -- conditions that are believed to attract them, said Oscar Schofield, a biological oceanographer and assistant professor of marine science at Rutgers.</p>
        <p>''The problem really is that jellies are incredibly hard to study,'' Professor Schofield said. ''If you think of the way an oceanographer studies the ocean for critters, you drag a net. And if you drag a net, you destroy soft-bodied gelatinous critters, so you tend to underestimate their importance or how much is out there.''</p>
        <p>What is known about the lion's mane jellyfish seen off New Jersey is that they are mostly sexually mature adults that scientists trace to some of the ocean's deeper reaches. The adults shed their sperm and eggs, which -- once fertilized -- form larvae that grow into tiny bottom-dwelling polyps. Those develop into what resembles a small stack of pancakes, each of which is released and forms a jellyfish.</p>
        <p>''The metamorphosis that makes them a jellyfish is probably triggered by an elevation of water temperatures,'' said Peter Anderson, director of the Whitney Laboratory at the University of Florida. That's why you see them during the summer.''</p>
        <p>But the numbers of jellyfish, and when they will appear, are nearly impossible to predict because prevailing winds and currents dictate their movements.</p>
        <p>Though some beaches along the 127-mile-long coastline are reporting a late jellyfish season, officials in Cape May say the beach has been flooded with them.</p>
        <p>''There has been a much higher than usual amount of jellyfish in our water, especially this early in the season,'' said Lt. Geoff Rife of the Cape May Beach Patrol, which has treated as many as 60 stings a day. ''What we're not really understanding is why they're here, because the cold weather usually means the jellyfish aren't quite as prevalent.''</p>
        <p>In past seasons, nature's roulette wheel has also turned up Portuguese men-of-war, the more dangerous and infamous relative of jellyfish.</p>
        <p>Jellyfish tentacles host thousands of stinging cells, or nematocysts, containing  toxic threads that are wound up and triggered by chemical or physical contact. The threads then unfold and discharge like harpoons. But what many swimmers don't realize when they try to cleanse a jellyfish sting is that fresh water hastens the process.</p>
        <p>Arthur Goldberg, a marine toxin expert and professor of environmental science at Southampton College on Long Island, said fresh water increases osmotic pressure in the nematocyst capsules and induces the discharge of the harpoon-like threads.</p>
        <p>Although lion's mane jellyfish contain toxic proteins and peptides like those in more lethal species, they cause fewer fatalities because their harpoonlike threads shoot out in a curve, slowing penetration.</p>
        <p>Still, the lion's mane hurts when it stings, leaving large red welts or ridged zigzag lines across the skin that mirror the path of lashing tentacles. ''Poisonous and Venomous Marine Animals of the World,'' by Bruce W. Halstead and Donovan A. Courville, classifies the stings of their genus, Cyanea, as ''moderate to severe.''</p>
        <p>Barefoot beachgoers, wet from a recent outdoor shower, might feel discomfort if they walk on the tentacles of jellyfish that have washed ashore. But the stinging thread tubes of lion's mane jellyfish are unlikely to pierce the thicker skin on bare soles or palms.</p>
        <p>The gap between science and its application on New Jersey's beaches appears wide. Despite the warnings about using fresh water, some lifeguards say they recommended it as a salve.</p>
        <p>''We just encourage them to head home and take cold showers,'' said Michael Raymond, beach chief of Long Beach Township. ''We don't really endorse anything, but we've heard old wives tales about vinegar, meat tenderizer and rubbing alcohol. But the cold shower just really seems to relieve it. In severe cases when someone is having an allergic reaction, we have oxygen and  cold packs and try to make them as comfortable as possible.</p>
        <p>Scientists also warn against contact with dead jellyfish. Larry Madin, senior scientist and biology chairman at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute said that although the lion's mane does not have stinging cells on its bell, its tentacles, shorn by the battering of surf, could be nearby and may have active stinging cells.</p>
        <p>One preventive measure that appears to work is waterproof suntan lotion. Still, scientists are not certain if stinging cells fail to discharge because of the absence of the necessary chemical stimulus in the lotion, or whether the lotion simply blocks toxic thread tubes from penetrating the skin, said Richard Mariscal, a biology professor at Florida State University.</p>
        <p>Even more debatable than measures to prevent stings are the methods to treat them. For instance, Dr. Madin prescribes vinegar as the best antidote to neutralize the sting. Others use alcohol to dry the wound, though reaching for a beer is taboo because of its high water content. Still others swear by meat tenderizer, which contains an enzyme derived from papaya called papain that is said to break down proteins in the toxin.</p>
        <p>''I've also heard people say that most of these things are placebos and if you rub sand on it, it works just as well,'' Dr. Madin said.</p>
        <p>Preventiong and Treating a Sting</p>
        <p>Experts suggest a number of ways to reduce the chance of jellyfish stings:</p>
        <p>* Wear waterproof sunblock.</p>
        <p>* Wear a Lycra wetsuit.</p>
        <p>* Wear goggles or a facemask.</p>
        <p>* Keep your distance; lion's mane tentacles can reach 10 feet.</p>
        <p>* Don't touch dead jellyfish.</p>
        <p>In case of an encounter, these steps can ease the pain:</p>
        <p>* Dry your skin.</p>
        <p>* Avoid rubbing the area.</p>
        <p>* Gently peel off tentacles with a twig or stick.</p>
        <p>* Do not rinse with fresh water.</p>
        <p>* Apply meat tenderizer, vinegar or dry sand.</p>
