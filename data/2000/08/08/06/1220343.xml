        <p>To the Editor: My husband and I had the same reaction to Jill Abramson's piece on traveling with teenagers ''In Search of Phat'' (July 23).</p>
        <p>Even children who enjoy the privilege of extensive travel should be taught to appreciate its pleasures and not view a family vacation as a penance to be endured only if punctuated by ''phat.''</p>
        <p>On a recent trip to Paris -- complete with female teenager (17) and male preteenager (11) -- we found our children to be good humored and interested (almost all the time!) in whatever we were doing. We spent six and a half hours at the Louvre, and I was the one to cry ''uncle.'' Naturally, their appreciation of history and culture needed to be interspersed with activities such as timed runs up the stairs of Notre Dame, teasing of street mimes by my son and a two-hour stint in the boutiques of the Marais for my daughter.</p>
        <p>Openness to new experiences is the key to enjoying travel at any age, and I believe it is unfair to characterize all children -- even the dreaded teenager -- as unable to make the normal compromises involved in traveling.</p>
