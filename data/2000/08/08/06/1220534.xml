        <p>As rain came down on the small makeshift runway in Ferry Point Park on Thursday morning, John Pimentel, a 70-year-old retired tool-and-dye maker with a pilot's license, gave his airplane one last system check, looked carefully over the controls and gave the prop engine a hearty rev.

        <p>As rain came down on the small makeshift runway in Ferry Point Park on Thursday morning, John Pimentel, a 70-year-old retired tool-and-dye maker with a pilot's license, gave his airplane one last system check, looked carefully over the controls and gave the prop engine a hearty rev. With a gentle push of a lever, the plane accelerated across the pockmarked strip until it was airborne.</p>
        <p>The Piper plane was cruising the gray sky smoothly, but Mr. Pimentel, who built the machine himself, was not in it. As the plane, a one-fifth scale radio-controlled model, banked hard left and glided through the sky, Mr. Pimentel let out a boyish smile.</p>
        <p>''It'll do everything a real plane will,'' he said, standing next to the  runway holding a small control box. ''Except carry passengers.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pimentel is one of about 130 members of the Blue Angels Radio Model Flying Club. The 50-year-old Bronx-based club has been flying radio-controlled planes of every conceivable shape, size and type next to a sanitation depot in Ferry Point Park, a former city landfill in the shadow of the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge.</p>
        <p>The club's members, 80 percent of them from the Bronx, range in age from 9 years old to over 70 and include doctors, lawyers and even a few real pilots.</p>
        <p>''We have a diverse bunch,'' said  Carmine Cutrofello, the club's president, a retired construction worker.</p>
        <p>But the Blue Angels may be enjoying something of a swan song.</p>
        <p>Ferry Point Partners, a private developer, is spending $22.4 million to build a 222-acre, 18-hole par-72 golf course in the park, with a number of  restaurants, a waterfront promenade and other amenities. Construction began two weeks ago. The Blue Angels' runway and flying area, in which the club has invested more than $70,000, its members say, will be razed to make room for sand pits and greens.</p>
        <p>City officials said they expected the course to be completed in the fall of 2001. Ferry Point Partners has a 35-year contract from the city to run the course, which will be open to the public. But club members said they were worried that once the golf course was built, they would soon be homeless and have to disband.</p>
        <p>Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern said last week that the Blue Angels would always have a home in the city's parks.</p>
        <p>''They're very nice people, and they've got a great hobby,'' Mr. Stern said. ''They used Ferry Point Park when it was a landfill, and now that there's going to be a wonderful park there, we'd like to keep them if we can.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Stern said Soundview Park, which is west of Ferry Point Park,  was a possible future airport for the flyers. He also said he would help them find a home.</p>
        <p>''There will always be a place in the parks for them,'' Mr. Stern said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Cutrofello and Mr. Pimentel are skeptical about the club's future. ''The club has really lost its heart because of this,'' Mr. Cutrofello said. ''We just can't believe it.''</p>
