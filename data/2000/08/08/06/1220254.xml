        <p>Magic Terror</p>
        <p>Seven Tales.</p>
        <p>By Peter Straub.</p>
        <p>Random House, $24.95.</p>
        <p>The magic in Peter Straub's third collection is his revelation of human character as a source of both evil and innocence. The terror is what makes his people talk: every story turns on a confession, like that of the perversely homicidal kindergarten teacher in ''Ashputtle.'' In a somewhat creaky fashion that owes more to 19th- than to 20th-century narrative conventions, Straub's articulate characters go on for such great lengths that unless they're already dead, like the condescending ghost in ''Hunger, an Introduction,'' it's a wonder they're able to breathe. This, and Straub's affection for the gratuitiously disgusting, like the demented hotel worker who forces his 5-year-old son to help him feed and wash the rotting corpse of the boy's mother in ''Bunny Is Good Bread,'' can make some of these tales off-putting. ''The Ghost Village'' is the most restrained of the stories here. It's about American soldiers in Vietnam who discover that the wartime horrors that shove them into madness are reverberations of darker deeds that they will never fully comprehend. ''Magic Terror'' closes with ''Mr. Clubb and Mr. Cuff,'' a comic piece about a cuckolded financial planner who hires a two peculiar private detectives to injure his wife and her lover, only to be robbed and maimed by this twisted pair. Oddly enough, the man is reduced to a state of gibbering, surprisingly appropriate gratitude.</p>
