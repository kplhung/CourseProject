      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Prince Albert is in a can.</p>
        <p>And nobody is going to let him out.</p>
        <p>Al Gore has got to be dying.</p>
        <p>Nothing has been going his way. Everything has been going W.'s way.</p>
        <p>One White House official tried to dismiss the Republican convention, filled with black entertainers and sombrero-wearing Latino singers onstage and well-fed white guys in the audience, as ''Showboat.''</p>
        <p>(Related footnote: In 1962, W.'s uncle Jonathan made the front page of Variety when he considered reviving a black-face minstrel show Off Broadway.)</p>
        <p>But no matter What Lies Beneath his contrived tableau of inclusivity, W., in essence, has already had the Democratic convention.</p>
        <p>If the Democrats want to respond in kind, they will have to stick all their women and minorities in the audience and parade a bunch of rich old white guys in half-moon glasses checking the Nasdaq ticker onstage.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, already coiled to the max, must head to the West Coast for his big week with scenes of a Bush triumph buzzing in his head.</p>
        <p>It doesn't look promising.</p>
        <p>If the vice president wants to step out of the president's shadow, L.A. is not the place to do it. Indeed, it is impossible to think of a worse city to showcase the Democratic nominee.</p>
        <p>Hollywood is Bill's town, and Hillary's town.</p>
        <p>It is not Al's town, or Tipper's town. (Her relentless jamming on the drums has not drowned out the memory of her campaign against dirty rock and rap lyrics.)</p>
        <p>Sure, it's a palindrome. AL-LA. But how can the Uptight Al Gore try once more to set free the Real Al Gore if no one is paying any mind?</p>
        <p>Every day brings news of another lavish tribute/fund-raiser larded on for Bill and Hillary, with Whoopi, Barbra, Cher, Carly, Harvey, Bette. Best of all is one for Hillary at Kenny Rogers's ranch, starring Red Buttons.</p>
        <p>(Al baby, when your two weak points are a sex scandal and a fund-raising scandal, do you guys really have to go to the capital of sex to fund-raise? Not to mention the home of the Buddhist temple and Monica Lewinsky's birthplace, Rodeo Drive.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton, oblivious to such problems, is thrilled to get another chance to hang with David Geffen. He thinks L.A.'s the most fitting place for what he wistfully calls ''my farewell convention.''</p>
        <p>The president has even been invited to a fete Sunday for his sanitized, idealized alter ego, Josiah Bartlet, president of the luminous ''West Wing.'' (Where vixens never presume to linger over pizzas in the Oval Office.)</p>
        <p>Although Al is trying to hustle the First Couple out of town after the convention's first night, they're coming several days early to rattle their tin cups, so they will actually spend more time in L.A. than the nominee.</p>
        <p>Hollywood players have struggled to transfer their affections to Mr. Gore. But the most fickle town in the world remains steadfastly loyal to the Entertainer in Chief. The boy from Hope gave the glitteries all the respect and overnights in the Lincoln Bedroom they yearned for; plus he's a bona fide groupie.</p>
        <p>We had a movie star who was a president and a president who liked to cut loose with the Rat Pack. But Bill Clinton was the first president to act as if he would actually rather be a movie star. He didn't scorn Hollywood values. He aspired to them. He was the sort of world leader who liked to take a break from a meeting with Boris Yeltsin to spend quality time with Sharon Stone and Cindy Crawford.</p>
        <p>Hollywood, where focus groups also determine how the product is pitched, has an uneasy sense that Mr. Gore is a supporting character, not a leading man. He's bad box office. And we can only assume he hasn't taken advantage of offers from worried directors  like Steven Spielberg to help him improve his ''I Walked With a Zombie'' speaking style.</p>
        <p>Los Angeles also makes Mr. Gore a juicy target for the Republicans. The man who ''reinvents'' himself ''at every turn,'' according to Mr. Bush, is going to the capital of reinvention to reinvent himself yet again.</p>
        <p>On Thursday night, W. extolled simple Midland values -- humility, spirituality, a sense of community and an impatience with pretense.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore will give his speech amid Hollywood values -- out-of-control  egos, blatant materialism, a dog-eat-dog ethos and a devotion to pretense.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, who hopes to win by excoriating louche Clinton values, summed up the president this way: ''So many talents, so much charm, such great skill. But in the end, to what end? So much promise, to no great purpose.''</p>
        <p>What better way to describe Hollywood?</p>
