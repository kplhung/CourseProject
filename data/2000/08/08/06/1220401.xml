        <p>ONE pair of scientists observed that it resembles a mop hiding beneath a dinner plate. And a famous author exaggerated the threat of its sting: ''Behold the lion's mane!'' cried Sherlock Holmes as he revealed the murderer in an Arthur Conan Doyle story, declaring the jellyfish deadlier than a cobra.</p>
        <p>But the lion's mane jellyfish, whose red bell and orange tentacles stir both fear and awe as it pulses with the currents, is hardly the thorniest of the ocean's blossoms.</p>
        <p>The lion's mane, the jellyfish most common along Westchester and other East Coast shores, inflicts its most serious damage on those who are allergic to its protein-based toxins or unlucky enough to be struck in the eye by the microscopic harpoons on its flailing tentacles.</p>
        <p>Now on its annual visit, the lion's mane (Cyanea capillata) is beginning to appear, along with the sea nettle (Chrysaora quinquecirrha), a jellyfish that is sighted less frequently.</p>
        <p>For a seasonal regular, however, the jellyfish has come under remarkably little scrutiny. By the end of the Labor Day weekend, it will drift from memory like a pair of lost sunglasses.</p>
        <p>''One reason is that they are very difficult to capture and maintain alive, given their soft bodies,'' said Robert Nawojchik, staff biologist at the Mystic Aquarium in Mystic, Conn., adding that their commercial irrelevance has contributed to the dearth of research. ''Many of our best-known species of fish and marine mammals are ones that were commercially exploited, such as salmon, where there's tons of research.''</p>
        <p>David Barkley, the owner of Marenostrum Aquarium, an Elmsford store that specializes in saltwater fish, said few enthusiasts keep jellyfish because they require a special cylindrical tank ''and a circular water motion that keeps them spinning so they don't smash against the sides.''</p>
        <p>Lifeguards said it is hard to predict how heavy a jellyfish season is ahead for beachgoers, based on sightings so far.</p>
        <p>''Day to day it varies,'' said Joanne Marchesani, supervisor of the county's water recreation programs. ''I don't know if it's the weather or ocean environment, but some days there are more than others. Some days you don't see any at all.''</p>
        <p>What is known about the lion's mane jellyfish usually seen in local waters is that they are mostly mature adults, which scientists trace to the ocean's deeper reaches. The adults shed their sperm and eggs, which, when fertilized, form larvae, which  grow into tiny bottom-dwelling polyps. Those develop into what resembles a small stack of pancakes, each of which is released and forms a jellyfish.</p>
        <p>''The metamorphosis that makes them a jellyfish is probably triggered by an elevation of water temperatures,'' said Peter Anderson, a jellyfish expert and director of the Whitney Laboratory at the University of Florida in Marineland. ''That's why you see them during the summer.''</p>
        <p>But the numbers of jellyfish and their arrival dates are nearly impossible to predict because prevailing winds and currents dictate their movements. Indeed, experts said they could only guess why some summers bring more jellyfish than others.</p>
        <p>''How many jellyfish are out there depends on a number of factors, such as weather patterns, temperature patterns and current patterns,'' Dr. Nawojchik said.</p>
        <p>Jellyfish tentacles have thousands of stinging cells, or nematocysts, containing toxic threads that are triggered by chemical or physical contact. The threads then unfold and discharge, like harpoons.</p>
        <p>Although lion's mane jellyfish contain toxic proteins and peptides like those in more lethal species, they cause fewer fatalities because their threads shoot out in a curve, slowing penetration. It's the difference between a pin prick and planting a stake.</p>
        <p>Still, lion's mane jellyfish hurt when they sting, leaving large red welts or ridged zigzag lines across the skin that mirror the path of lashing tentacles.</p>
        <p>Scientists know more about how not to treat a jellyfish sting -- fresh water should never be applied, they advise -- than a positive remedy.</p>
        <p>Arthur Goldberg, a marine toxin expert and professor of chemistry and environmental science at Southampton College on Long Island, said fresh water increases pressure in the nematocysts and induces the discharge of the threads.</p>
        <p>Barefoot beachgoers wet from a recent shower could feel discomfort if they walk on the tentacles of some species that have washed ashore. But the stinging threads of lion's mane jellyfish are unlikely to pierce the thicker skin on soles or palms, Dr. Goldberg said.</p>
        <p>Scientists also warn against contact with dead jellyfish. Although the lion's mane does not have stinging cells on its bell, said Larry Madin, senior scientist and biology chairman at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute in Woods Hole, Mass., its tentacles, shorn by the battering of surf, could be nearby and may have active stinging cells.</p>
        <p>One preventive measure that appears to work is waterproof suntan lotion. Scientists are unclear, however, whether stinging cells do not discharge because of the absence of the necessary chemical stimulus in the lotion, or whether the lotion blocks the toxic threads from penetrating the skin, said Richard Mariscal, a Florida State University biology professor who specializes in marine stings.</p>
        <p>Even more debatable than prevention are the methods of treating stings. Westchester's lifeguards prefer to apply vinegar, said Chip Mathews, the county's deputy commissioner of parks and recreation who oversaw the county's lifeguards several years ago.</p>
        <p>Dr. Madin agreed that vinegar is the best treatment. But others employ alcohol to dry the wounded flesh, though reaching for a beer is taboo because of its high water content. Still others swear by meat tenderizer, which contains papain, an enzyme derived from papaya, which is said to break down proteins in the toxin.</p>
        <p>''I've heard people say that they're not sure meat tenderizer is that effective,'' Dr. Madin said. ''I've also heard people say that most of these things are placebos, and if you rub sand on it it works just as well.''</p>
