        <p>HOUSES that moderate-income families can afford have become elusive in the Town of Huntington, where the median price in the resale market is $338,000 and the price of new houses is often half a million dollars or more.</p>
        <p>Concerned about the lack of modestly priced housing, town officials have prepared legislation that would require that developers who are granted a zoning change set aside some units for moderate-income buyers. The Town Board is expected to vote on the proposal on Aug. 29.</p>
        <p>Town officials say that the prices on these units should not exceed $125,000. This amount, they say, is the maximum that families with annual incomes of $60,000 or less can afford. The $60,000 figure is 80 percent of Long Island's median, a measure often used to define ''moderate income.''</p>
        <p>All new subdivisions of 10 or more lots requiring a zoning change would be affected. Developers who are granted a higher density would have to set aside 20 percent of the additional units for moderate-income residents. A public hearing on the measure, which Frank P. Petrone, the town supervisor, and Steve A. Israel, a town councilman, are sponsoring, was held July 11.</p>
        <p>''This is the start of a very, very aggressive housing program, probably the most aggressive of any of the towns on Long Island,'' said Mr. Petrone, a Republican.</p>
        <p>While praising some aspects of the proposed law, housing advocates are sharply critical that it would not be retroactive, which means that it could not apply to one of the largest vacant tracts remaining in the town, on which a rezoning application is already pending.</p>
        <p>The 380-acre parcel was formerly occupied by the Long Island Developmental Center, a state-owned children's psychiatric hospital. The site, part in Melville and part in Dix Hills, borders the Northern State Parkway and Carman Road just north of the Long Island Expressway. The current owner, SBJ Associates, bought it from New York State in October for $16.1 million. The state retains one children's hospital building and 34 group homes on 78 acres.</p>
        <p>The zoning now in effect for the former hospital site would allow only one house on a two-acre plot, or fewer than 190 houses on the 380 acres. SBJ is proposing to build up to 1,375 housing units. Of these, 1,225 would be for sale: single-level condominiums, town houses, and semidetached and detached houses around a private 18-hole golf course. The remainder would be rentals.</p>
        <p>Only 75 of the larger detached houses on  half-acre and one-acre lots would be offered for sale to all age groups, and they are expected to sell for $500,000 and up. The remainder, including the rentals, would be restricted to families in which at least one member is 55 or older.</p>
        <p>That provision has stirred the most controversy. Critics contend that property that once was publicly owned should now include housing for young families and for residents with moderate incomes.</p>
        <p>SBJ is taking the position that it is meeting another important need: housing for older residents. ''This property cannot solve all the town's housing needs,'' said John A. Harras, a partner in Morton Weber &amp; Associates, the Melville law firm representing SBJ. ''We are providing a project that meets a housing crisis for seniors, who are the fastest-growing population in the town.''</p>
        <p>In its rezoning application, SBJ, which is a partnership formed by two development companies, Benjamin Development of Garden City and Jobco of Great Neck, has offered to sell 100 of its proposed 400 condominium apartments for $145,000, which represents a $30,000 discount. State and county subsidies could further reduce the price to $125,000, Mr. Harras said.</p>
        <p>Under an earlier proposal, SBJ wanted to build 150 assisted-living apartments. It is now offering to build 100 rental apartments under a federal program that subsidizes the rents of low-income elderly tenants.</p>
        <p>SBJ has also said it would donate $2.5 million to a housing trust fund that the town could use for such purposes as subsidizing  mortgages or providing grants for down payments for needy families. ''There is no way that anyone can criticize this project for not having an affordable component,'' Mr. Harras said.</p>
        <p>O NE of the two partners in SBJ, Benjamin Development, also owns an eight-acre tract on Ruland Road in Melville, where it is proposing to build 120 one-bedroom and studio garden apartments open to all age groups and selling for no more than $125,000 each. That would help provide badly needed starter homes for young couples working in the Melville area,  Mr. Harras said.</p>
        <p>But critics say regardless of all these proposals, moderately priced housing for young families should still be part of the mix at the former hospital property.</p>
        <p>Jim Morgo, the president of the Long Island Housing Partnership, a nonprofit group based in Hauppauge, called the SBJ plan a ''missed opportunity.''</p>
        <p>''It perpetuates the idea that seniors only want to live with seniors and be segregated, and it misses the chance to do a visionary community with various housing types,'' said Mr. Morgo, who served as a consultant on the proposed legislation.</p>
        <p>The Rev. John A. Jurik, the pastor of St. Peter's Evangelical Lutheran Church in Huntington Station and a member of a coalition known by the acronym Lican, which stands for Long Island Congregations, Associations and Neighborhoods, said: ''There is a crying need both for affordable housing for seniors and for affordable housing for families with children. Surely, out of 1,375 homes, 150 could be set aside for families.''</p>
        <p>The idea of developing the former hospital site largely for age-restricted housing was first proposed in 1996 by a task force formed to come up with a plan for the site when state officials first announced they would sell it. The 12 task force members represented the state and county governments and local residents.</p>
        <p>The concern was that building housing for all age groups would bring an influx of children into the Half Hollow Hills school district, said Mr. Petrone, the town supervisor. He said that about 1,500 new homes have been built in the district in the last few years, and if the number of children continued to grow, new schools would have to be built. School taxes could rise by as much as  30 percent, he said.</p>
        <p>''We understand that there is a need for affordable housing for families, but you also have the practical problem of crowded schools,'' he said. ''So balancing all that, we came out with a senior housing program, for which we have now negotiated 100 affordable condominium units and 100 affordable rental units.''</p>
        <p>The remaining housing on the former hospital property would be 350 three-bedroom town houses expected to sell for $250,000 to $270,000 and 400 semiattached and detached three-bedroom houses on the golf course selling for around $350,000.</p>
        <p>The Long Island Association, a nonprofit business group with offices in Commack, is also opposed to the SBJ plan, because it views high housing costs as a threat to the region's ability to keep or draw workers.  ''The issue of affordable housing on Long Island is more important than the effect on any individual school district,'' said Mitchell Pally, the group's vice president for legislative and economic affairs.</p>
        <p>Although the town officials appear to be  standing firm on the SBJ proposal restricting housing at the former hospital site mostly to older residents, critics of the plan have won concessions on the pending legislation.  It now specifies that developers cannot impose age restrictions on any of the units they are required to offer at reduced prices, and  units must have at least two bedrooms.</p>
        <p>But critics are pushing for another  change. As now written, the proposal would permit developers to reduce the 20 percent requirement to 10 percent by contributing to  the housing trust fund instead. The amount to be paid into the trust fund would depend on the density the developer is granted under a rezoning. A fee of $75,000 per house would apply where lots are 15,000 square feet or less; $150,000 per house for lots of 20,000 square feet and $200,000 per house for lots of one acre.</p>
        <p>Opponents of that provision say that with so little land still available for development within the town, building housing is more important than building a trust fund. ''Once the land is gone, the opportunity to build more affordable housing is also gone,'' said Mr. Jurik, the Lutheran pastor.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Israel, the leader of the Town Board's Democratic majority, said he was unwilling to concede that point because the trust fund could serve a broad base of needy families and first-time buyers. ''Housing advocates feel the entire 20 percent should be used for housing built on site, and I think that's very shortsighted,'' he said.</p>
        <p>To guarantee that the housing will remain  moderately priced, the proposed law would require deed restrictions to limit profits when owners resold their houses.</p>
        <p>Although critics of the town plan say that it falls short, they also praise the town for proposing any program at all. ''It's a town doing something,'' said Mr. Morgo of the Long Island Housing Partnership.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jurik said the need now was for all groups to work together. ''If reasonable people sit down around a table and talk about this,'' he said, ''we won't end up as a fractured society.''</p>
