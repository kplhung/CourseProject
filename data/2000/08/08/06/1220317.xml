        <p>I LIVED a powerful love story, I understood nothing about it, and I needed to delve into my questions in a film,'' said the Belgian director Frederic Fonteyne, by way of explaining his tender, unconventional and emotionally charged movie about middle-aged romance, ''An Affair of Love.''</p>
        <p>But he says the film, which has been acclaimed in Europe and which opens here on Friday, is not autobiographical. Written by his longtime friend and collaborator Philippe Blasband, it depicts a 40-something woman and a slightly younger man who meet in Paris through a personals ad that the woman has placed in order to fulfill a particular sexual fantasy. The characters never tell each other their names, nor do they (or we) have any information about their respective backgrounds.</p>
        <p>We also never see the enactment of the fantasy that brings them together: for the most part, the camera stops outside their hotel-room door. During the course of their encounters, the couple fall in love. But we aren't allowed to hope that their relationship will work out: interspersed with the flashbacks of their affair are interviews in which each character, alone, talks about the now-ended liaison. And as might be expected, each tells a slightly different story.</p>
        <p>The film, which was called ''A Pornographic Affair'' in its European release, stars the French actress Nathalie Baye and the Spanish actor Sergi Lopez. Ms. Baye was named best actress at the 1999 Venice Film Festival and the film earned the distinction of opening the New Directors/New Films series this spring at the Museum of Modern Art.</p>
        <p>''The film has a lot of interesting levels,'' said Richard Pena, program director of the Film Society of Lincoln Center, which presents New Directors with the museum. ''What is going on, what the characters say is going on, and then what we think is really going on.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fonteyne, a quiet 32-year-old with the burly build of a lumberjack, looks as if he would be more at home directing a buddy film (which he did for his first feature) than delivering a mysterious, intimate take on a thwarted midlife love affair. Part of a Belgian cinematic flowering that began in the early 1990's with offbeat films like ''Man Bites Dog'' and culminated in the first Belgian Palme d'Or at the 1999 Cannes International Film Festival (for Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne's ''Rosetta''), Mr. Fonteyne shares the ironic bent of his compatriots Benoit Mariage (''The Carriers Are Waiting'') and Alain Berliner (''Ma Vie en Rose'').</p>
        <p>But unlike their movies, ''An Affair of Love'' is an out-and-out love story, springing from Mr. Fonteyne's fascination with the unresolved romance in his own past. ''The film asks questions about what love is, but also explores how you talk about a love story once it's finished,'' he said, speaking in French, while in New York for the New Directors series. ''I wanted to film the pain and pleasure of recollection -- like a jewel in a box that you peek at before you close it again.''</p>
        <p>For him, the greatest irony in ''Affair'' is that the couple separate not from loss of love but because they fatally second-guess each other. ''I'm interested in how people talk to each other, and how do they not talk to each other,'' he said. ''When you explore communication, you also have to explore the moments when it breaks down.''</p>
        <p>By starting with the end, and by withholding background details, the film does away with many of the usual hooks of narrative. Instead, it focuses on the poignant contrast between experience and memory, and on the shifting sands of truth.</p>
        <p>Explaining why the characters he wrote remain anonymous, Mr. Blasband said he ''wanted to make this story as pure and elemental as possible.'' He chose Paris as a setting, he said with a laugh, because ''Brussels is such a small town that it would be difficult to have an affair here anonymously.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Blasband's original title, ''A Pornographic Affair,'' was a reference to the sexual nature of the couple's tryst. But the title proved troublesome for some European audiences, who stayed away thinking the film might be porn. Those who have seen the film sometimes have the opposite reaction, Mr. Fonteyne said. They ask him why he did not show (or tell) the couple's sexual fantasy outright. His reasons have nothing to do with coyness.</p>
        <p>''A fantasy is a completely private thing,'' he said. ''The strongest way to convey it is by a closed door. We wanted to do an erotic film where the eroticism exists not just in the sex scenes but also when the characters look at each other and think of their fantasy.''</p>
        <p>In fact, when we finally see the couple make love -- without the fantasy -- the impact comes from everything we haven't seen before. Mr. Fonteyne's approach to eroticism is clearly different from the explicitness of such filmmakers as Catherine Breillat (who directed the recent French film ''Romance''). But, as a Belgian filmmaker, he said, ''I did not want to do a typical French film about love.''</p>
        <p>Asked what distinguishes the Belgian point of view, he responded: ''I think it's in our slightly skewed sense of humor. Belgium is such a strange country, with its two languages and cultures; we're always at the point of the absurd. I also think that there's a realist side to our films, the opposite of glamour.''</p>
        <p>This gritty humor surfaces in scenes like the one where the characters first meet. In a painfully funny moment, Ms. Baye's character, who is nervous, starts talking about her longtime quest for a hairy man. As she recounts her saga in great detail to the astonished Mr. Lopez (who, fortunately, fits the bill), it becomes clear that we are far from a chic, Gallic-style first encounter.</p>
        <p>''That human tone is one of the things I really liked about this script,'' Mr. Lopez said from Madrid. ''So often, the man feels he must take the initiative. But in this film, there is no power struggle: the man accepts and enjoys the woman's strong personality.''</p>
        <p>MR. FONTEYNE had long wanted to work with Ms. Baye, who is one of France's most famous actresses and who has starred in such films as ''The Return of Martin Guerre.'' Ms. Baye, in turn, loved the character. ''It's rare to have a role of that beauty when you've passed 40,'' she said, on the telephone from Paris.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Fonteyne surprised everyone by casting Mr. Lopez as his leading man. The Spanish-born Mr. Lopez (who speaks French in the film) was well-respected for films like ''Western'' but was not widely known for romantic roles. ''I wanted to put together these two people who seem to have nothing to do with each other, and see what happens,'' Mr. Fonteyne said. ''Sergi didn't even know who Nathalie was, but there was a real curiosity and openness between them.''</p>
        <p>Although most of the film was scripted, Mr. Fonteyne had Ms. Baye and Mr. Lopez improvise some of the interviews. Since the two actors did not know their characters' backgrounds, what became important to them was, as Mr. Lopez said, ''playing people caught entirely by surprise by love.'' In their duet-like scenes, they relied upon Mr. Fonteyne's sense of balance. ''The three of us had a real complicity,'' Ms. Baye said. ''Frederic may be young, but he has a powerful emotional gauge,'' she added. ''He would listen intently until what we were playing rang true inside him.''</p>
        <p>According to his friends, Mr. Fonteyne has always combined his ability to listen with a quiet stubbornness. As an introverted teenager, he thought about becoming an artist. His father was at that time the artistic director of an advertising agency; his mother, who is Hungarian, had fled to Belgium as a young girl during the Hungarian uprising of 1956.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fonteyne ended up going to film school (at the Institut des Arts de Diffusion in Louvain-la-Neuve), where he met Mr. Blasband and, through him, Patrick Quinet, who is his producer and who founded the Brussels company Artemis Productions.</p>
        <p>The trio are like a youthful Three Musketeers of Belgian cinema -- and, indeed, soldierly grit is needed to get a film produced in Belgium. Even now, the paucity of domestic financing for cinema restricts the production of Belgian films to a handful a year, and requires most films to be international co-productions.</p>
        <p>In 1997, Mr. Fonteyne finally managed to direct his first feature, ''Max and Bobo,'' about the tormented friendship between a hairdresser and a hobo. ''Max'' flopped at the box office, but Mr. Fonteyne hardly blinked before embarking on ''An Affair of Love.''</p>
        <p>In the wake of his second film, he is pausing for breath. ''I did my first two films so fast,'' he said. ''I've said to myself that I will stop for one year and think about things, and just live. And I'm sure that my next film will be completely different. I've done my version of a love story now; I don't need to continue to do love stories all the time.'' He laughed. ''I still may not understand love, but at least I can now talk of other things.''</p>
