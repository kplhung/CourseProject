        <p>BELZ-Philip. The Yeshiva University family mourns the passing, in Memphis, of a longtime and deeply cherished friend, a distinguished worldwide philanthropist and communal leader, and patriarch of his family and community. He was an honorary YU trustee and honorary alumnus. He and his late wife, Sarah, were YU Benefactors who advanced the musical heritage of the Jewish people through the establishment of the Philip and Sarah Belz School of Jewish Music at our affiliated Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary. They also established in their names Yeshiva College's Department of Music and a Belz School scholarship fund. Mr. Belz's devotion to Yeshiva University was legendary and he will be sorely missed by his fellow trustees, the faculty, and students of YU. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his son, YU trustee and Sy Syms School of Business Board member, Jack A. (and Marilyn) Belz, YU Guardians and Sy Syms School of Business Founders; great-grandson, Andrew J. Groveman, Yeshiva College Board member; grandchildren; great-grandchildren; and the entire family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Dr. Norman Lamm, President Yeshiva University David S. Gottesman, Chairman YU Board of Trustees Cantor Bernard Beer, Director Philip and Sarah Belz School of Jewish Music</p>
