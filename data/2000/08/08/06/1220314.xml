        <p>Rick Delaney and Zo Charlton, Austin, Tex., May 11, 2000</p>
        <p>Rick Delaney: ''We are both artists. I do digital media. Zo's a painter. When we had a long-distance relationship, we talked at least five times a week, and every three or four months I would drive 13 hours to see her. And we did a lot of letter writing. But now that we live together, it's kind of hectic. At the time she moved in, I was the one working late. Then I started working days, and she has become a night owl. I leave her alone when she's working, so I come home and say hey and go to bed. A lot of times we just play catch up, I guess. That morning it was fun to lounge around.''</p>

        <p>Zo Charlton: ''It was exciting to see each other in the morning. We have opposite schedules. We live together and we don't see each other. Two months is the longest we've gone without sitting and having a meal. But that morning it was the strangest thing. It was like a date. We don't usually have real idle, relaxed talk. Those moments are so important because they make us realize what we miss about each other. It's like, I'm in love with you and that's why I'm here.''</p>
