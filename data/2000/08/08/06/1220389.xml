        <p>FOR as long as anyone can remember, the Boy Scouts of America have been using public school buildings for their troop meetings. But in at least two Long Island school districts, this longtime tradition may soon be broken.</p>
        <p>The debate in Smithtown and Huntington centers on concerns that the Boy Scouts discriminate against gays.</p>
        <p>After the United States Supreme Court, acting on the case of an assistant scoutmaster from New Jersey who was expelled for being gay, ruled in June that the the Boy Scouts have the right to ban homosexuals, the two Long Island school districts began to question whether to allow the Scouts to use their buildings this year.</p>
        <p>In Huntington, the debate began at a school board meeting last month, when one board member, Lynn Kaufman, suggested that in light of the Supreme Court ruling, the Boy Scouts should be considered a discriminatory group.</p>
        <p>''When I looked at the policy of our school district, it clearly stated that groups using the facilities must be nonexclusionary,'' she said in an interview, ''and since the Boy Scouts are not, they no longer fit the description outlined in our policy. It's a very emotional issue, but if you take the emotion out of it, it's pretty cut and dry.''</p>
        <p>The board deferred action on the issue, but by the next board meeting, on July 24, it had taken center stage.</p>
        <p>''If you want to make a point with the Boy Scouts of America, write a letter, but don't punish our children,'' Stephen Hoey of Huntington, a scout volunteer, told the board. ''The Boy Scouts of America believes that boys of scouting age should not be engaged in sexual activity of any kind, and its leaders, as role models, should keep private matters private. Clearly, the Boy Scouts should not have a scout leader advocating a lifestyle that, in the view of the Boy Scouts of America, was in direct conflict with the Scout oath and Scout law.''</p>
        <p>''The real issue before the Board is the fair treatment of my sons and the other 60 boys in Pack 181 and the hundreds of kids in other packs and troops in the district.''</p>
        <p>On the other side are parents like Les Baltimore, who also spoke at the board meeting. ''I think the Boy Scouts should be free to use the facilities if they make it clear that in Huntington they will not discriminate against anyone or exclude members, including individuals who may be gay,'' he said in an interview.  Interim Superintendent James Brucia, who met with Boy Scout representatives last week, defined the district's quandary.</p>
        <p>''Our district has a longstanding policy that says a school building cannot be used by community groups unless they are nonexclusionary and open to all people,'' Dr. Brucia said. ''But the Boy Scouts have a national policy that won't be changed, and they have a sent a letter to our attorney indicating that if we ban them from using our schools, they will sue.''</p>
        <p>In Smithtown, the school board president, Richard Weinblatt, raised the issue at last month's board meeting.</p>
        <p>Superintendent Ronald D. Valenti defended the status quo.</p>
        <p>''I have no evidence to indicate that our local Boy Scouts are doing any kind of scrutiny with respect to sexual orientation,'' he said. ''On the contrary, I'm told that it's a non-issue, and at this point I don't want any children hurt or victimized by what may be a national tug-of-war over this issue. Unless someone can bring evidence that they are exclusionary in nature, my advice is that we continue with the current practice of allowing the Scouts to use our facilities.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Valenti said the school board would vote on the issue at its next meeting, on Aug. 22.</p>
        <p>Though no votes on the issue are scheduled at other school districts on the Island, it was a topic at a law conference in Melville last month sponsored by the New York State School Boards Association.</p>
        <p>''A number of districts are concerned that if they permit this outside group to continue to meet after school hours, the district might be perceived as condoning a group that is discriminatory,'' said Jay Worona, general counsel of the association.</p>
        <p>At the conference, Mr. Worona said, educators discussed Section 414 of New York State law, which describes the limited purposes for which school district premises can be used.</p>
        <p>''The law states that a district can only use its facilities for purposes that are 'nonexclusive,' '' he said, ''which brings up the question: if a group bars an individual from joining it, would it be inconsistent with the obligations set under this section of the law?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Worona referred to a 1994 case that centered on the use of school buildings in the Rochester school district by the military.</p>
        <p>''The City of Rochester had an antidiscrimination policy that wouldn't allow any group to come on the premises and engage in an act that would be discriminatory towards any person or entity,'' he explained. ''When the military wanted to use the schools for recruitment, the city denied their request because the military engages in discriminatory actions against homosexuals. A lawsuit followed against the district for rejecting the military, and the final ruling by the New York Court of Appeals sided with the district.</p>
        <p>''The issue that school districts are now grappling with is whether the term 'nonexclusive' applies to the Boy Scouts,'' he said. ''It makes good sense for a local district to interpret these policies in a way that is logical to them, as long as it is applied consistently. If a district disallowed the Boy Scouts and then let in another group that is also discriminatory in its membership, that district could get into trouble.''</p>
        <p>Other interested parties are also sitting on the fence. The Nassau-Suffolk School Boards Association president, Judith Chen, said the group has taken no position, and Barbara Bernstein, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union in Nassau County, called the debate ''a complicated issue.''</p>
        <p>''The education law says that a school district does not have to open its facilities for public use,'' Ms. Bernstein said, ''but once it does, it has to let anyone use them equally. The problem arises when you have a school board that has its own anti-discrimination policy that would be in conflict with the education law.''</p>
        <p>Ken D'Apice, executive director of the Suffolk County Council of the Boy Scouts of America in Medford, said that denying access to scout units for their meetings would be unwarranted.</p>
        <p>''This will accomplish nothing but shortchange the children and families in the area,'' Mr. D'Apice said. ''The Suffolk County Council of the Boy Scouts has been here for 75 years, actively teaching tolerance, embracing diversity and never inquiring into the sexual orientation of youth or adult volunteers applying for membership. We are proud of the long and successful partnerships that the Scouts have had with community groups and school districts, and hope it will continue.''</p>
        <p>In Nassau County, Trip McMillan, executive director of the Theodore Roosevelt Boy Scout Council in Massapequa, said he had not been contacted by any of the county's school districts over this issue.</p>
        <p>Robert Kroll, a Merrick lawyer and father of an Eagle Scout, said that aside from legal issues, there are emotional issues involved.</p>
        <p>''Personally, I don't care if some of the Scouts are gay,'' he said. ''That's their concern, and I never would have tried to remove my son from the troop if any members were gay. But I would oppose my son's troop leader being gay because at that age, troop leaders are role models for the boys. While I agree with the Supreme Court decision that the Boy Scouts are a private organization and have a right to make their own decision over membership, I also understand not wanting to support an agency that is discriminatory. The bottom line is, this is really a dilemma.''</p>
