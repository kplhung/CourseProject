        <p>LAST month, when an arbitrator awarded Suffolk County police officers a contract that raises salaries by 20 percent over four years, officials across the Island who are facing their own negotiations shook their heads in disbelief and dread.</p>
        <p>Disbelief because Suffolk County officers are already among the highest paid in the nation. Dread because they know that the raises would set the pace for more than 40 municipalities and other entities on the Island that have their own police departments.</p>
        <p>''The arbitrator's decision was good news for police unions, but bad news for people trying to put budgets together,'' said Bruce Nyman, city manager of Long Beach, which is negotiating a new contract with its police union.</p>
        <p>Since the state law that governs negotiations with the police provides for binding arbitration and allows an arbitrator to consider the salaries of neighboring departments when making a decision, Mr. Nyman said, there is little doubt that unions will now confidently seek raises comparable to Suffolk County's.</p>
        <p>''Right now,'' he said, ''it doesn't look like a fair fight for us anymore.''</p>
        <p>Suffolk County's contract and the expected domino effect has brought renewed cries from local officials to change the state's 1967 Taylor Law, which governs collective bargaining for public-employee unions and which they feel favors the unions and hamstrings the municipalities.</p>
        <p>Thomas R. Suozzi, the mayor of Glen Cove, has also proposed that the counties, towns and villages negotiate to have their police contracts expire at the same time, which could end the current pattern, where pay scales leapfrog one another with each settlement.</p>
        <p>But union officials and state legislators who defend the current system say such a proposal ignores the fact that while state law grants police departments binding arbitration -- a bargaining tool most other public-employee unions do not enjoy -- it also denies officers the ultimate weapon, the right to strike.</p>
        <p>''Blaming the arbitrators and saying leapfrogging gives unreasonable raises -- these are just criticisms that give everybody some political air cover,'' said Gary DelaRaba, president of the Nassau County Police Benevolent Association. He noted that Nassau's police contract has gone to arbitration only once in 20 years.</p>
        <p>But Mayor Suozzi said that whenever one department wins a favorable decision from an arbitrator, as Suffolk County has, the mere threat of binding arbitration is often enough to put an end to meaningful negotiations in other police departments.</p>
        <p>''I'll posture one way, the P.B.A. will posture another way, and eventually I throw my hands up,'' he said, ''because an arbitrator will give what Suffolk County has, so why go through the expense of hiring lawyers and arbitrators to go through what's pretty much a charade?''</p>
        <p>Under the arbitrator's decision, the base pay of Suffolk County police officers with five years' experience will rise from $67,071 to $80,251 by 2003. Just with the initial annual increase, 4.6 percent, Suffolk officers will make more than Nassau's current base pay for officers with five years' experience, which is $68,662.</p>
        <p>Local officials say the subsequent increases -- 4.75 percent in the second year and 4.5 percent in each of the last two years -- will give other police unions unreasonable expectations.</p>
        <p>''As it is now, everybody's going to be bound one way or another by Suffolk County's contract until 2003,'' Mayor Suozzi said. So he has proposed that all administrators try to negotiate contracts that also end in 2003. In Glen Cove's case, this would mean no more than a two-year contract when the current one expires next year.</p>
        <p>Officials from both counties said they would welcome a change in the current system but were skeptical of the chances for a common contract expiration date because the police unions are sure to oppose it.</p>
        <p>''That's just nonsense,'' Peter J. Schmitt, the Republican minority leader of the Nassau County Legislature, said of Mayor Suozzi's suggestion. ''It's simply not doable. It's also not about when the contracts expire, but when they are settled,'' he added, noting that some villages and towns settle contracts quickly while others wind up in protracted talks, thus allowing a natural window for ''me too'' demands.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schmitt also added a partisan jab at Mr. Suozzi, a Democrat, for calling a news conference to make his proposal. ''I guess the county executive's race has started early,'' he said. Many politicians say Mr. Suozzi plans to run for county executive next year, and he has a war chest of about $500,000.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Suozzi said he is mainly interested in keeping police costs reasonable. ''It wouldn't be easy,'' he said of his proposal. ''But it's something you can negotiate for in good faith, and it's probably an easier point to win in arbitration than things like salary and benefits.''</p>
        <p>Many officials said it would be wiser to change the state law that dictates what an arbitrator can consider when making a decision, though similar proposals over the years have failed because of the heavy influence of police unions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schmitt held out hope, though, that the time just might be right. ''Perhaps there could be some adjustments made, especially now that the state is working with us to solve our fiscal problems,'' he said, referring to the $100 million bailout plan for Nassau that the state approved this year and the state's oversight board to monitor county finances.</p>
        <p>Michael J. Butler, a lawyer and a retired Nassau police captain who studies police compensation, said that in an ideal world, binding arbitration would be nothing more than a balance for the ban on strikes, as police unions claim.</p>
        <p>''The problem is, arbitrators frequently don't look to a municipality's ability to pay for raises, but to its ability to tax,'' he said. ''So instead of really taking into account how much a county or a village can pay, an arbitrator will look to an adjoining agency and say, 'You can raise taxes to meet the pay standards set by that agency,' when that just isn't always the case.''</p>
        <p>Nassau and Suffolk County officials both said that this kind of reasoning has led to what they view as unreasonable pay raises, and will lead to similar ones until the state modifies arbitrators' standards.</p>
        <p>Why, for example, asked Suffolk County Executive Robert J. Gaffney, don't arbitrators compare salaries on the Island with those in New York City, where salaries are significantly lower? The base pay for New York City officers with five years' experience is only $52,268.</p>
        <p>(New York City is not exempt from the upward pressure on salaries. The police union fought for years to cancel the city's exemption from the Taylor Law, which had police contracts reviewed by city and not state arbitrators. They finally won state arbitration in 1998 and will negotiate their first contract under the new guidelines this year. Police union officials hope state arbitration will help bring salaries in the city closer to suburban levels.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Gaffney said the Island's higher salaries have clearly helped recruit strong police candidates.</p>
        <p>''I recognize that we have an excellent police department that's free of a lot of the problems that other departments have because we can attract the best people,'' he said. ''But I don't know how long this leapfrogging can be maintained, because eventually we'll find that all our money is being used for police protection and little else.''</p>
        <p>Nassau County officials fear exactly that, because the department accounts for more than a quarter of the $2.2 billion annual budget. The police contract expires at the end of the year and officials are particularly wary because the county must find $50 million in budget cuts and new revenues this year and $70 million in each of the next three years to satisfy the state's bailout plan.</p>
        <p>Dianne Baumert-Moyik, a spokeswoman for County Executive Thomas Gulotta, said Nassau would favor new state guidelines similar to those used by some New Jersey municipalities, where ''standards are really based on a municipality's ability to pay.''</p>
        <p>But Assemblyman Eric N. Vitaliano, a Democrat from Staten Island who is chairman of the Committee on Governmental Employees in the state Assembly, noted that local officials have lobbied unsuccessfully for similar changes for years, and said the changes had been denied for good reason.</p>
        <p>''The truth is, a municipality's ability to pay already is a factor, and each side can offer evidence to make its case,'' he said. Local officials would no doubt rather see a municipality's ability to pay take precedence over other factors, he said, but that would unfairly skew the process.</p>
        <p>''The way the law is set up is a fair and equitable way to resolve these kinds of issues while still assuring that the delivery of police services will not be interrupted,'' he said. ''To do it any other way would give the municipalities an unfair advantage, and then we'd be going back to the days of wildcat strikes and all kinds of other nightmares we've been able to avoid because of the Taylor Law.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gaffney is not convinced.</p>
        <p>''The whole system is out of balance,'' he said, ''with police departments routinely getting higher raises than other municipal unions. So the law is creating an economic elite. There has to be a better way.''</p>
