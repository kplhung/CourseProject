        <p>World Wrestling Federation champion known as The Rock, whose real name is Dwayne Johnson, appears at Republican National Convention, where he delivers voter registration message; photo (S)</p>

        <p>BY the evidence of flying headbutts, figure-four leglocks and The People's Elbow, you might not see The Rock as a G.O.P. kind of guy.

        <p>BY the evidence of flying headbutts, figure-four leglocks and The People's Elbow, you might not see The Rock as a G.O.P. kind of guy. He is usually in black underwear, talking trash, wiggling eyebrows as expressive as John Belushi's, in his role as the World Wrestling Federation's hunkiest heel and its reigning champion.</p>
        <p>But there he was last week, not at a Wrestlemania or a Smackdown, but at the Republican National Convention, which shared two things with the W.W.F.: the event was scripted and the outcome was never in doubt.</p>
        <p>The Rock was ''in the house,'' as he likes to say, to deliver unto the conventioneers a voter registration message and to introduce Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, a former wrestling coach, strictly an amateur.</p>
        <p>''Can you smell what The Rock is cooking?'' he asked, a trademark question (translation: ''If you know what I mean''), which he first uttered at Wrestlemania XIV in 1998, sitting next to Gennifer Flowers, who was interviewing him.</p>
        <p>See, The Rock is political. And politic. He never labeled the convention crowd at First Union Center in Philadelphia a ''bunch of jabronis'' (that is to say, nobodies).</p>
        <p>''Fourteen million eligible voters watch The Rock every single week,'' he said with an oratorial fervor calculated to inspire young Republicans and voters everywhere to perform their civic duty. But were they watching? Do the G.O.P.'s demos mix with the W.W.F.'s young male viewers? Only if they were hoping to see a steel-cage death match pitting the tag team of George W. and Poppy Bush against John S. McCain and Jesse (The Governor) Ventura, who wrestled when The Rock was a mere pebble.</p>
        <p>Just who is The Rock?</p>
        <p>His real name is Dwayne Johnson, a 28-year-old, third-generation wrestler, who is half Samoan and half African-American.</p>
        <p>The Rock, a thoroughly rotten character, is short for his former nom de mat, Rocky Maivia, a nice guy who finished last -- like Michael S. Dukakis. He speaks of himself almost entirely in the first person. As in, ''The Rock says . . .''</p>
        <p>His autobiography, ''The Rock Says . . .'' (Regan Books), was on the New York Times best-seller list for 20 weeks, falling six weeks short of ''Have a Nice Day!'' by another another wrestler, Mick Foley (a k a Mankind and Cactus Jack).</p>
        <p>In his 283-page memoir, he writes about why The Rock is The Rock.</p>
        <p>His irresistible personality: ''The Rock is charismatic, funny, smart . . . and completely over the top in terms of ego and arrogance.''</p>
        <p>His modest ego: ''With his sculpted physique, honey-brown complexion, razor-trimmed sideburns and piercing gaze, The Rock looks like a million bucks -- which is appropriate since that's almost exactly what The People's Champion will earn for his evening's labor.''</p>
        <p>His serendipitous character development: ''The quirks and peculiarities evolved organically. I never said, 'Hmmm, I need a gimmick. I need an angle, I need . . . I need . . . I need an eyebrow! And then -- I know! -- I'll take the most basic maneuver in wrestling and turn it into the most electrifying move in wrestling, and I'll call it The People's Elbow! Yeah, that's the plan!' ''</p>
        <p>His ingenious mission statement: ''It's funny, I always like to say now that The Rock is the kind of guy who won't kiss a baby and he'll throw an old lady across the street.''</p>
        <p>Now, get out and vote!</p>
