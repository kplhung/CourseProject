        <p>IT has been 32 years since Lorraine Serabian sang ''Life is what you do while you're waiting to die'' in the Broadway musical ''Zorba.''</p>
        <p>Coming full circle in the art of grand despair, Ms. Serabian is playing Maria Callas. Ms. Serabian recalls that Callas, in her last reclusive years, said to a friend, ''All one more day of life means is having one day less of having to deal with it.''</p>
        <p>That Ms. Serabian, whose life is cheerier than her roles, is performing in Terrence McNally's ''Master Class'' at Hofstra University in Hempstead is another sort of full-circle story.</p>
        <p>Hofstra is where Ms. Serabian first happened upon the stage, as a Polynesian princess in Maxwell Anderson's ''Wingless Victory.'' ''Nineteen roles in four years,'' she said, recalling the roles, but not the years.</p>
        <p>Even in college, Ms. Serabian went for the diva parts. She was Queen Gertrude in ''Hamlet,'' Clytemnestra in ''Iphigenhia in Aulis'' by Euripides and Irina Nikolayevna Arkadin in Chekov's ''Sea Gull.''</p>
        <p>She graduated with a theater major, recalling that Francis Ford Coppola was in her class -- as well as a neighbor in Hollis Hills ''when it was just a forest'' -- and that Lainie Kazan was at Hofstra ''around that time.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Serabian saw Callas ''at the old Met, when I was a mere child,'' she recalled and again during one of Callas's ill-fated Carnegie Hall recitals. That was in 1974, three years after her fabled series of 23 master classes at Juilliard, and four years before her death in Paris at the age of 53. ''I have the emotion, but I don't know if I can sing,'' Ms. Serbian recalls Callas saying, from the stage.</p>
        <p>In his play, Mr. McNally fictionalized one of those classes, using it as a framework for Callas's remembrances of her glory days, when she represented the lost art of bel canto, and her heartbreaking ones, after Aristotle Onassis abandoned her.</p>
        <p>In ''Master Class,'' Callas announces to the students and the audience, ''I hope you're not expecting me to sing.'' About the bravura role, Ms. Serabian said, ''It's the most taxing I've ever done.</p>
        <p>''She was so driven, from being fat, ugly and horrible to reinventing herself as a beauteous creature. But she never believed that. This business can make you crazy and you can become a monster.</p>
        <p>''With her own demands upon herself, investing so much in every role, she blew her voice out in 10 years, and then she was fighting for survival. She lost her humanity as an artist. And in her grasping for a reason to live, she was totally vulnerable with Onassis who made her have an abortion. She allowed herself to become a victim. I have a good time portraying him as a lowlife in the flashback scenes.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Serabian's career hasn't all been melodrama and tragedy. A ''wonderful gig'' Ms. Serabian has had, three times now, is the role of Jacqueline in ''La Cage aux Folles.'' Jacqueline is the one who who leads the chorus in ''The Best of Times.''</p>
        <p>''Master Class,'' through Aug. 20, Monroe Lecture Center Theater, Hofstra University, (516) 463-6644.</p>
