        <p>For years the pier jutting 800 feet into the Hudson River along Jersey City's shoreline has served as a giant parking lot for the Harborside Financial Center office complex. That will soon change.</p>
        <p>The first full-service hotel on the resurgent waterfront will rise atop the old pier over the next 24 months. The nine-story, 350-room hotel is being developed by the Hyatt Hotels Corporation of Chicago and the Mack-Cali Realty Corporation, the real estate investment trust in Cranford, N.J., that owns Harborside. To be called the Hyatt Regency South Pier, the hotel will have over 20,000 square feet of meeting and conference space, a restaurant and a health club.</p>
        <p>To support the hotel, some of the pier's wooden pilings, which shipworms and other marine borers have snacked on over the years, are being encased in concrete. Portions of the pier's concrete deck will also be replaced and supported by steel pilings, said Sidney M. Johnson, the chief engineer at Sidney M. Johnson &amp; Associates, a marine engineering concern in Clark, N.J. That work is expected to be completed in four to six months. Brennan Beer Gorman, the Manhattan architectural firm, has designed ''a contemporary hotel with lots of windows to maximize the views'' of the river and the Manhattan skyline, said Peter Gorman, a partner.</p>
        <p>As now planned, the hotel will step back at the fourth and ninth stories, and its eastern facade will feature a curtain wall of curved glass and concrete and 300-degree views.</p>
        <p>The exterior will be clad in salmon-colored panels resembling stucco.</p>
        <p>The main lobby and the meeting rooms will be on the third floor, with the restaurant at its eastern end. The hotel's top floor will house a 4,500-square-foot ballroom opening onto a terrace.</p>
        <p>There will also be a 120-foot long public park at the eastern end of the pier, linked by public walkways on either side of the hotel.</p>
        <p>The cost of the project, including the pier rehabilitation, will be close to $100 million, the developer said.</p>
        <p>Brian T. Banaszynski, the senior director of development at Mack-Cali, said that along with the hotel, a seven-story 300-unit rental building planned for Harborside's north pier will be completed by late summer in 2002.</p>
