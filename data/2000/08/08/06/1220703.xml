        <p>''Life is putting Prozac to the test,'' says the mobster and family man Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini) in a clip from ''The Sopranos.'' In the opinion of David Chase, that HBO show's creator and lead writer, life should do as much for television. Mr. Chase gets the most from the medium. Early in his career he wrote movies, but television was more about people. ''You could explore characters and not be so plot-driven,'' he says on ''Influences,'' a new series starting tonight at 7:30 and running for eight Sundays on Bravo.</p>
        <p>Introduced by Alan Alda, ''Influences'' invites 16 prominent actors and writers to describe who or what in television's past inspired them in their careers. The full title of the series is ''The Museum of Television and Radio: Influences,'' and if that sounds a little dry, know that participants like Roseanne and Ray Romano step lively through their reflections, backed by clips from the museum's 100,000 hours of television.</p>
        <p>For nine years the museum has produced network specials on subjects like teenagers and women on television, but this is its first series. Tracey Ullman and Ted Danson get their say tonight. On later shows, so will Tyne Daly, John Lithgow, Larry Gelbart, Tom Fontana, Eriq La Salle, Dick Wolf, Susan Lucci, and others. Roseanne is scheduled for Aug. 20, Mr. Romano for the week after. Each participant gets 15 minutes. There are no rules especially. As they talk, other influences occasionally sneak in -- radio, for instance, or theater -- but primarily they speak of television.</p>
        <p>''Television now has a history; a couple of generations have been brought up on it,'' said Robert M. Batscha, the museum's president. ''Now we have a group of entertainers and writers who have a frame of reference.''</p>
        <p>Hail, Caesar (as in Sid and ''Your Show of Shows'') and ''The Twilight Zone,'' Imogene Coca, Milton Berle, Lucille Ball, Jackie Gleason, Johnny Carson and ''Saturday Night Live.'' These days, with the same quiz show filling space three nights a week and ersatz castaways providing a slice of so-called reality, television can be excused a midsummer pause to reassure itself that it doesn't have to be this way.</p>
        <p>The giants, from Jack Benny to Bill Cosby, get their due, but influences come from everywhere. Ms. Ullman owes much to Lily Tomlin, both for her role as switchboard operator (''That's one ringy-dingy'') on ''Rowan and Martin's Laugh-in'' and her cross-dressing, a forerunner of Ms. Ullman's own male impersonations. But she also cites the starkly realistic 60's television plays of the British filmmaker Ken Loach.</p>
        <p>More in the mainstream, Mr. Danson remembers the physical comedy of Dick Van Dyke and John Cleese and cites Andy Griffith as being able to use comedy to reach the same sort of elemental sadness Mr. Danson strove for as the bartender Sam Malone on ''Cheers.''</p>
        <p>Most of those on ''Influences'' appear before the camera, but some, like Mr. Chase and the writer Larry Gelbart, work behind it. ''We wanted people working in TV today,'' Mr. Batscha said, ''and they needed a history.'' Obviously no newcomers to television, Roseanne and others on the show are affected by earlier television and are influences themselves.</p>
        <p>Mr. Alda speaks for them all. ''Sometimes their inspiration has become a more interesting and complex experience,'' he says. ''As they become mature artists, the new generation sometimes longs to take the earlier images and deepen them, find out what's under the comfortable surface.''</p>
        <p>Roseanne, he says, could be honest, brutal, tender and hilarious all in the same episode, sometimes all in the same line of dialogue. Asked to do something about her son in a clip from ''Roseanne,'' she replies, ''I gave birth to him, what more do you want?'' But on ''Influences'' she also longs for the utterly and impossibly simple parent-child relations on ''Leave It to Beaver.''</p>
        <p>Earlier she mentions ''The Twilight Zone'' and Rod Serling's ability to change viewer's sense of proportion. ''That's what television is,'' she says. Then she turns the question of influences back to the viewer: ''Do people think that something they spend a third of their lives staring at does nothing to them?''</p>
        <p>''The Untouchables,'' the 60's series with Robert Stack as the F.B.I. mob buster Eliot Ness, did something to Mr. Chase. The show represented the 20's, his father's time, a whole other era in which ''people made their own hell,'' he says. Other Chase influences: ''The Rockford Files,'' for its decency and lack of sentimentality, and ''Twin Peaks,'' for its nonlinearity and its habit of not being too clear about anything. Much television fails because people communicate so clearly, he says.</p>
        <p>''Dark means complex in Hollywood parlance,'' adds Mr. Chase. ''You don't know where people are coming from or what they're going to do from moment to moment.''</p>
        <p>He also credits ''The Twilight Zone,'' particularly for its wild camera angles and all the inventive ways Serling came up with to do things cheaply and on a three-day shooting schedule.</p>
        <p>Swinging away from television, Mr. Gelbart, a creator and writer of ''M*A*S*H,'' among many shows on television and the stage, mentions the early days of radio and how comedians like Bob Hope affected his style. ''Watch 'M*A*S*H' with your eyes closed and you're really hearing radio,'' he says.</p>
        <p>Later in his career he moved to ''The Red Buttons Show,'' whose 7-to-10-minute skits taught him structure. Then he worked for Mr. Caesar. ''Sid sat in the room with his writers on a simple gold throne,'' he says.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gelbart shares his half-hour with Mr. Lithgow, star of ''Third Rock From the Sun.'' An acclaimed stage actor whose father produced Shakespeare festivals in the Midwest, Mr. Lithgow watched little television as a boy. In fact, his family had no television until he was 9 years old and the Army-McCarthy hearings were being broadcast. When the black-and-white set was finally plugged in, young Lithgow took to Milton Berle, Jack Benny, old movies starring Chaplin, Keaton and Harold Lloyd, and shows with vaudeville roots. Later he made a name doing comedy on Broadway.</p>
        <p>On ''Influences'' he says that ''Third Rock'' is closest to the stage comedies of George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart, which he admires for their ability to bring many strands of comic complication to one roaring head. ''People ask me if I miss theater,'' Mr. Lithgow says. ''I tell them I do theater every week.''</p>
