        <p>WAS there ever a problem that couldn't be eased when contemplated in the presence of a water view? Probably not, which may explain why a home on the water has become the ultimate acquisition of the Long Island suburban dream.</p>
        <p>This thirst for beachfront runs especially deep on the Island, where most residents lead landlocked lives sprinkled with teasing reminders of their proximity to the sea -- the inland-ranging gulls, the occasional whiff of salt air and, a short drive away, mouth-watering stretches of coastal scenery.</p>
        <p>But anyone diving into the market for beachfront property had better be prepared for sticker shock.</p>
        <p>''About 40 to 50 percent of my clients request waterfront until they find out what it costs,'' said Robert Scribner, broker for the Prudential Long Island Realty office in Westhampton. There, beachfront prices range from a one-bedroom condo on Westhampton Beach for $120,000 to a $5 million estate in Quogue. He said that in the last year, the price of waterfront real estate had escalated 60 to 70 percent, while other property had risen only 20 percent.</p>
        <p>Not that price seems to be the deterrent it once was, given the booming economy. Of 22 waterfront homes that Mr. Scribner sold in the last 12 months, he said, all were paid for in cash.</p>
        <p>Robert Scalia, owner of Albertson Realty, which sells property from Calverton to Orient Point, said that in 1995 he had about 80 different waterfront homes to choose from, scattered across the North Fork's creeks, bays and beaches.</p>
        <p>''Today, if there is one, it's unique,'' Mr. Scalia said. ''Inventory has been gone for more than a year. The second home has replaced the luxury car as the status symbol of choice.''</p>
        <p>And understandably so. Who wouldn't be eager to show off a home situated, say, where Kathy and Desmond O'Sullivan live, on a crescent-shaped road that hugs Mount Sinai Harbor in Port Jefferson? Their summertime view of a brilliantly blue, boat-speckled harbor that looks as if it were lifted from a Caribbean travel brochure, could buoy anyone's spirits -- or fan anyone's envy.</p>
        <p>The O'Sullivans bought their home and its two acres of land 26 years ago, before the market took off. Then, their five-bedroom colonial home cost less than $200,000.</p>
        <p>Cindy Rothstein, whose wall-size kitchen window looks out onto Reynolds Channel in Oceanside, said that in her neighborhood 30 years ago, the difference between buying a home on the water or one overlooking the sidewalk was only a few thousand dollars. Now, the difference can be up to $200,000, according to Neil Sterrer, owner of Sterrer Realty in Long Beach.</p>
        <p>''One purpose behind purchasing an ocean- or bayfront property is to ensure an unobstructed water view,'' Mr. Sterrer said. ''For that reason, the value of these waterfront properties tends to appreciate better than comparable inland real estate.''</p>
        <p>Veterans of waterfront living, wise enough to stake their claim when bargains were possible, say they have not tired of life on the water because the view is always changing.</p>
        <p>''In fall, the leaves drop and our wraparound water view comes back,'' Ms. O'Sullivan said. ''In December, when the Sound is still holding on to its summer heat and the advancing winter is trying to suck it out, we've seen great plumes of mist rise up and march across the water like invading armies. Later in the year, we see magnificent ice formations that collect on the breakwaters. In the summer, we walk barefoot through our woods to the beach.''</p>
        <p>Of course, life on the water isn't always smooth sailing. Ms. O'Sullivan said that in calm summer weather, the bugs eat you alive. And in winter, she said the northeaster winds set the windows to rattling so ferociously that it's hard to stay home.</p>
        <p>There are, however, meteorological advantages to offset the drawbacks, said Aram Terchunian, a coastal geologist and president of First Coastal, an environmental consulting firm.</p>
        <p>''If it's 85 degrees on the beach on Westhampton in August it will be 95 degrees 10 miles inland in Riverhead,'' he said. ''In general, climate is more moderate by the water than it is farther inland.''</p>
        <p>Of course, hurricanes and northeasters happen with a respectable degree of regularity.</p>
        <p>''When someone thinks about buying a home on the water and asks me, 'Is this safe?' or 'Will it wash away?' the answer is, we don't know,'' Mr. Scribner said.</p>
        <p>The most notorious recent example is the series of northeasters, beginning in December 1992, that obliterated a mile of barrier beach and Dune Road in Westhampton. Evidence of that disaster, however, has practically vanished, thanks to a $30 million project, started in 1993, to repair the breach and build up the beach. Since its completion two years ago, homes on Dune Road have sprung up faster than in a game of Monopoly -- proof that water-seeking humans are as unstoppable as nature. Mr. Scribner said that a Dune Road house going for $200,000 before the breach is now valued at $800,000 to $1 million.</p>
        <p>But there are water-view opportunities on Long Island for the not-quite-rich. Bethany Marten, owner of Home Buyers' Resource Center in Riverhead, said there is so much waterfront diversity on Long Island, from narrow canal to expansive ocean, that with the right mix of commitment and compromise, anything's possible.</p>
        <p>''You can still get something with an ocean view in the $200,000 range in places like Mastic or Shirley,'' Ms. Marten said. ''Actually, one of the real great bargains had been Lindenhurst, where you could get a decent home on the ocean in the low 200's, although those are becoming scarce. Most people in that price range are going to be looking at canals, like those in Baldwin Harbor. Property there, however, can be very thin, and you can feel like you are living in a fishbowl.''</p>
        <p>On the North Shore of Nassau, however, waterfront is at such a premium that buyers have been asking real estate agents to solicit beachfront homeowners in the hopes that the right price might tempt someone to sell.</p>
        <p>''We are now starting to see people get tired of commuting out to the Hamptons and are looking to buy a summer home in Sands Point,'' said Karen Newhouse, executive vice president of Douglas Elliman in Port Washington. She said a two-acre parcel of bare Sands Point beachfront sold this year for $3.5 million, nearly triple the $1.3 million that was paid for the same site three years ago.</p>
        <p>But Luisa Reichardt, head librarian for Suffolk Community College, proves that even on an academic's salary, real estate miracles can happen.</p>
        <p>Ms. Reichardt found herself scenically deprived two years ago, when she moved to Long Island from a mountainside town in New Hampshire. She said she was surprised at how easy it is to live on Long Island and yet never get to see the shore.</p>
        <p>''I had grown accustomed to living in beauty, but now was in a place of strip malls, congestion and traffic lights, where it was an ordeal just to buy a carton of milk,'' Ms. Reichardt said.</p>
        <p>For $155,000 she bought a two-bedroom, two-bath condominium on the bay in East Moriches, with a deck that overlooks a cove where, in good weather, she has her morning coffee in the company of glossy ibises, egrets and goldfinches.</p>
        <p>Except that in summer, Ms. Reichardt must share her piece of paradise with invading Jet Skiers. When fall returns, the duck hunters surface.</p>
        <p>''One thing I didn't expect to see outside my window was shooting and killing,'' Ms. Reichardt said.</p>
        <p>In winter, her solitude is restored, though she conceded that winter on the water can get bleak. But Herbert Hoffman, a contractor who lives part-time overlooking the Atlantic from his home in Westhampton Beach, claims to like winter best.</p>
        <p>''It is then that you have raw, pure, unadulterated nature, like when I've seen deer coming across the frozen bay from the mainland,'' Mr. Hoffman said. ''It's something when you are all alone, peacefully watching the ocean coming and going. It's hypnotic.''</p>
        <p>It can also be monotonous.</p>
        <p>''I've lived on waterfront property for half my life, and the ocean can be beautiful and expansive,'' Ms. Marten said. ''Winter, spring, summer, it can be pretty unchanging. If it's views you want, I go with the bay.''</p>
        <p>Forrest Clock, a builder who has lived in Lonelyville on Fire Island for 13 years, has both: the Great South Bay, which he sees from his kitchen window, and the Atlantic, visible from his dining room.</p>
        <p>''The bay is a known entity, shallow and kindly,'' Mr. Clock said. ''But the ocean is vast, largely unknown. People think of space as the final frontier; here it's the sea.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clock said that the beach-loving lifestyle doesn't really come into its own until September, when the crowds leave.</p>
        <p>''Then, the water is still warm,'' he said. ''We can stop work to go surfing, or to cast for bluefish and bass, right on the beach.''</p>
        <p>Owen and Maryann Kilgannon, who live on the Great South Bay in Massapequa, are also partial to the fall, when the boaters drift back inland and the sun has traveled far enough south in the sky to set, California-like, into the bay. Unfortunately, not all of their 30 years on the water have been suffused with that rosy sunset glow. Their home has been flooded four times.</p>
        <p>''My wife, who puts her heart and soul into interior decorating, gets more anxious about it than I do,'' Mr. Kilgannon said. ''But I figure, if we get flooded every 10 years, well, I can live with that. By then it's time to change the carpets anyway.''</p>
        <p>For people like the Kilgannons, a home on the water isn't just a house but a lifestyle. Mr. Kilgannon, who at 61 still water-skis each summer, raised six children in his home. ''The water kept them so busy and so entertained that they didn't have time to get into trouble,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Cindy Rothstein of Oceanside said that living on the water helped her family stay close, since it was the source of so many activities.</p>
        <p>''It meant sports, recreation and summertime fun,'' she said. ''We had a slide, two docks and a boat. In summer, the children used to slide right off into the water to swim or water-ski. We also became a pit stop for all our relatives, and had barbecues every weekend. This house turned out to be a perfect, fun house to grow up in.''</p>
        <p>''Of course, every September there is the hurricane scare, and we're told, evacuate, evacuate, evacuate,'' she said. And every 10 years, she said, they have to redo the bulkheads and rebuild the landscaping that's been lost to erosion.</p>
        <p>The cycle of homeowner expenses can be enough to drive the most water-loving individual inland. Dr. Theodore Goldstein, an obstetrician based in Port Jefferson, left a contemporary home on the Sound in Stony Brook for a wooded farm ranch that, in his opinion, is cozier and more steadfast.</p>
        <p>''The sunsets on the Sound provided me my daily moments of meditation and the lights of Connecticut sparkled like a diamond necklace,'' he said. ''I had a visual paradise there, where my hammock was strung between two trees, five feet from the beach. But then, once the sun started to set, the bugs came out.''</p>
        <p>And in winter, the biting bugs were replaced by biting cold. Dr. Goldstein said that the north winds that blow across the Sound in February made the house shake, the dog howl and the heating bills soar. He also mentioned the northeaster that flooded his well with saltwater and surrounded his house like a moat.</p>
        <p>But he is outnumbered by those dedicated beach dwellers, like Mr. Clock on Fire Island, who continue to navigate their sea of troubles to reap the water's scenic and sporting pleasures. ''We have no memory for pain,'' he said.</p>
