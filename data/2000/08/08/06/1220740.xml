      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The newest Clean Rite laundry, a 10,000-square-foot space on Eastern Parkway near Atlantic Avenue in East New York, Brooklyn, is not a classic mom-and-pop laundry. But the store, with 218 washers and dryers, is aimed at moms and pops: there is a CD-filled jukebox and a children's area with DVD movies, videos and board games.  John Sabino, the company's president, describes the 24-hour laundry as ''a family sport.'' With this, the company's 37th location, it hopes to brighten a block that now contains many boarded-up buildings and vacant lots.</p>
        <p>''We're an economic engine,'' says Tim King, director of real estate.</p>
