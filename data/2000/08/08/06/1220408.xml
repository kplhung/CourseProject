        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The 10-concert American Mavericks series by the San Francisco Symphony was not an academic symposium on modern classical music [''Corralling a Herd of Musical Mavericks'' by Richard Taruskin, July 23]. It was the summer festival of a major American symphonic orchestra. Summer festivals normally consist of Mostly Mozart or ''pops.'' The astounding fact about this festival was not which composers were included or not included. It was that a major American symphonic orchestra, with its huge overhead and large hall, was willing to gamble on this unknown and unusual music. Michael Tilson Thomas carefully commenced most pieces with a rudimentary explanation, coupled with photos of the composer projected on huge screens. This was a festival designed to convert and educate the average person, not to debate academic fine points. It proved that there is a large audience for new and more challenging classical music. Companies will pay to sponsor it, and audiences will pay to see it. The average age of attendees was decades younger than during the regular season, and there was an excitement in the hall rarely seen during the regular season.</p>

        <p>The festival was a strong affirmation that you can fill a large symphony hall for two solid weeks with people eager to experience 20th-century classical music.</p>
