        <p>Zab Judah was tested tonight, but he was also victorious.</p>
        <p>After being knocked down in the first round, Judah stormed back to record a fourth-round technical knockout over Terronn Millett at the Mohegan Sun Casino. With the victory, Judah, 22, a native of Brooklyn, retained the International Boxing Federation junior-welterweight championship and remained unbeaten (24-0, 18 knockouts).</p>
        <p>The fight was halted at 2 minutes 47 seconds of the fourth round, when Judah knocked down Millett, 32, for the third time. Millett rose at the count of four, but his legs were unsteady and the referee, Michael Ortega, decided to stop the bout.</p>
        <p>It was a fast-pace brawl from the opening round, but Judah never lost his poise, showing the hand speed and boxing ability that have made him a rising star. Millett (22-2-1), the former champion, was not intimidated. He surprised Judah midway through Round 1, flooring the champion with a hard left to the body.</p>
        <p>More embarrassed than hurt, Judah rose quickly, and from that point on he dominated the fight. Judah hurt Millett with two combinations near the end of the first round. In the second round, Judah sent Millett sprawling with a right to the chin. Millett survived the round, but he was clearly hurt.</p>
        <p>Two rounds later, the fight was over. Judah charged across the ring and inflicted a series of blows on Millett, who staggered sideways near the ropes and tumbled to the canvas. Millett got up, but Judah continued his assault and floored Millett again. This time, when Millett got up, Ortega looked in the beaten fighter's eyes and wisely waved the bout to an end.</p>
        <p>''If anyone wants to be I.B.F. champion, they have to beat me,'' Judah said. ''I love to fight good competition. He was a strong fighter, but I'm the king.''</p>
        <p>Millett gave Judah praise, but also felt he was rusty after not fighting for more than 12 months.</p>
        <p>''He's not the best I've ever fought,'' Millett said, ''but he's a good fighter. He caught me with a good shot. My hat's off to him.''</p>
        <p>It was the third successful title defense for Judah, who won the title in February when he knocked out Jan Bergman in the fourth round. Judah's previous fight before tonight was a 12-round decision over Junior Witter on June 24, a performance that was not one of Judah's best. But tonight Judah looked impressive against a quality opponent. And more prominent fights are surely in his future.</p>
        <p>PUNCH LINES</p>
        <p>In the main undercard, JUAN LAZCANO (24-2-1) won a split decision over JESSE JAMES LEIJA (40-5-2) in a 10-round lightweight bout. There were no knockdowns, and Lazcano felt he was fortunate to win. ''I couldn't bend my knees and get inside,'' Lazcano said. ''My legs weren't there. But you have to perform even when you're not at your best.'' Leija said he did not feel 100 percent. ''I hurt my shoulder in the second round,'' he said. ''I don't think it was warm enough. I couldn't throw my left hook.''</p>
