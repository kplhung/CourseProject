        <p>Nearly three decades ago, real estate agents across the nation began to make life easier for home buyers by sharing listings. Buyers visited just one broker, who could tell them about everything on the market, even properties represented by other brokers.</p>
        <p>The holdout was Manhattan, where real estate was handled the old-fashioned way: brokers jealously guarded their listings to avoid having to split their commissions with rival brokers.</p>
        <p>Last week, Manhattan saw the light. The borough's three largest brokerage firms -- the Corcoran Group, Douglas Elliman and the Halstead Property Company -- announced they were creating a database that would place their combined listings on the Internet.</p>
        <p>Brokers, brokerage firm executives and academics say the companies are acknowledging sweeping changes in technology, consumer demands and financial realities.</p>
        <p>Manhattan brokers had contended that the complex nature of the co-op market -- having to deal with board approvals and sensibilities toward privacy -- justified keeping listings private.</p>
        <p>''Manhattan was always considered special and different, and just because it worked somewhere else did not mean it would work here,'' Sharon Baum, a top broker at Corcoran, said while taking a break from shuttling clients around in her Rolls-Royce with ''SOLD 1'' license plates. ''To know how to deal with the boards, to know people on the boards and how to get your clients in -- it was a real art.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Baum and other brokers  admitted that agents citywide were less concerned about giving sellers the greatest possible exposure than they were about representing both sellers and buyers and not having to split commissions with other agents.</p>
        <p>Scott Durkin, the new chief operating officer at Corcoran, said that ''technology has clearly upstaged the helmet-haired, blue-blooded, Kelly-bag-swinging real estate agent.''</p>
        <p>Kenneth Patton, the executive director of the Real Estate Institute at New York University, said that these days buyers expected to be able to go to one place for all listings. And, he said, several Internet companies -- like mlx.com and nyrealty.com -- entered the market to provide such a compilation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Patton, a former president of the Real Estate Board of New York, said the brokerage firms responded by considering buying the online companies. They also began placing listings on their own Web sites. But their sites did not get as many hits as the more comprehensive sites, which companies like Goldman Sachs began to explore investing in.</p>
        <p>''Our biggest fear was that some third-party with deep pockets was going to come in, collect all of our listings and take our business away,'' Mr. Durkin said.</p>
        <p>And smaller brokerage firms had long pushed for sharing so they could offer clients the thousands of listings from the big brokerage firms.</p>
        <p>The ice began to melt. About nine months ago, senior executives at Douglas Elliman and Corcoran began discussing the creation of a multiple listing service like those in other places across the nation. Halstead joined the discussions in the spring.</p>
        <p>The joint database is seen as a way to share the cost of upgrading technology and to virtually eliminate the unit at each company that compiles other firms' listings, a system called cobroking, where brokerage companies can choose to disclose information. The firms also hope that the database will eventually be the best place to go for home listings, perhaps allowing them to cut newspaper classified ads.</p>
        <p>In the announcement last week, the firms said that they were inviting each brokerage firm in New York to participate. The brokers in the system will have to post almost all their listings to the shared database within 24 hours or face fines (amounts have not been determined). The only exception will be homes of sellers who request that the listing not be made available to everyone.</p>
        <p>One real estate industry official involved in the negotiations said it ''took a lot of courage'' because the firms were upsetting some of their own brokers and because the firms knew that a joint multiple listing Web site would ''cannibalize'' their own dot-com businesses.</p>
        <p>The firms are near a deal with California's homeseekers.com, which put the first multiple listing service online, to create the New York City system. They hope to have it running by Jan. 1. So far, 30 brokerage firms, including William B. May Company and Bellmark Realty, have signed on.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the online listing services in the city are girding for competition. One, nyrealty.com, is about to change its name to cityrealty.com and launch a site that will allow transactions online. Daniel Levy, president of nyrealty.com, said, ''Everyone is realizing that the Internet is affecting the real estate business, just like it is impacting every other form of business.''</p>
        <p>Alice Mason, a prominent independent broker in Manhattan, said the shared listings could have a pleasant side effect: collegial brokers. She recalled when ''people would meet a client across the street -- they would be afraid to meet them in the doorway -- because other brokers would see them and think they had a new listing.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 13, 2000, Sunday  An article last Sunday about several major brokerage firms that reacted to pressure from Internet listing services by planning New York City's first multiple listing service misstated the number of firms that signed up. It was four. Thirty was the number of firms that had expressed interest.</p>
