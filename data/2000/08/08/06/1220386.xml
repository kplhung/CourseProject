        <p>EVER since they bought it in 1967, Pete and Niki Spanakos have enjoyed living in their brilliantly white all-steel house in Sea Gate, Brooklyn. The beachfront house, believed to have been designed in 1936 by William Van Alen, architect of the Chrysler Building, is known in the neighborhood as ''the sugar cube.''</p>
        <p>Now that their children are grown, they are thinking about adding a third floor -- or perhaps leaving behind their spectacular view of lower New York Harbor and moving to Brooklyn Heights.</p>
        <p>In the Depression, architects began searching for new solutions to building problems, especially housing. In December 1932 the magazine Building Investment predicted that ''the manufactured house is sure to come,'' and the next year companies like Armco Steel exhibited prefabricated steel houses at the Century of Progress exposition in Chicago.</p>
        <p>In 1934 the magazine House and Garden published designs for new kinds of houses by several leading architects -- including a Prairie-style copper-clad house by William Van Alen. In September 1935 a letter writer named Herman Lazarus wrote to The New York Times predicting that metal houses would take over the market -- he said he had seen one erected in Flatbush in 12 days by only three men.</p>
        <p>In 1935 Van Alen announced that he had devised an all-steel house of prefabricated hollow panels nine feet high and four feet wide, with steel casement windows. It was to be bolted together, spray painted and coated with marble dust -- not exactly imitating stucco, but hardly in the same flashy mode as the stainless-steel top of the Chrysler Building.</p>
        <p>On July 23, 1936, Van Alen, working with a new company called National Houses, erected a seven-room model house of steel on a vacant lot at the northeast corner of 39th Street and Park Avenue. The interior was decorated in modern style, with photo murals, glass-block detailing and mildly modernistic furniture. The house was designed to sell for less than $10,000, and 1,500 people walked through it by noon of opening day. In January 1937 the house was disassembled and shipped to Gloucester, Va., for a radio comedian, Pat Padgett; it still survives.</p>
        <p>Four days after the model-house opening, a building lot at the western edge of Sea Gate, a gated community at the western end of Coney Island, was purchased by Dean C. Gilmore, who does not appear in city directories. Tax records indicate that a house was completed on the land, 5100 Ocean View Avenue, in 1937, valued at $8,500. Under ''description,'' the tax assessor wrote ''steel,'' and gave the owner's name as Paul Gilmore. This may have been the Paul Gilmore who was the manager of the Cherry Lane Theater, at 38 Commerce Street, but Gilmore disappeared from directories by 1943.</p>
        <p>Although a building permit has not been found, Mr. and Mrs. Spanakos have drawings in their possession by Van Alen for typical details of a steel house, and the details of their building match written descriptions and period photographs of the model house. A 1940 photograph from the Municipal Archives shows the Sea Gate house as a brilliant white cube dramatically set on the beachfront -- it could be a French vacation home on the North African coast.</p>
        <p>ADDRESS telephone directories indicate that the next resident of 5100 Ocean View Avenue was Harry A. Pollack -- for several years the Judy Ann Nursery School operated out of his house. In the 1950's Saul R. Fine was the owner, and the Spanakoses bought it from him in 1967 -- they said he told them that he had been a Secret Service agent detailed to President Franklin D. Roosevelt.</p>
        <p>''We didn't expect to buy it, it was too expensive, and we looked in Brooklyn Heights and in Manhattan Beach,'' said Mrs. Spanakos, who was born on East 70th Street in Manhattan. ''But Mr. Fine would call us to come out and look at the sunsets -- here you have the whole ocean in front of you -- and we finally did.'' They said they paid less than the $65,000 Mr. Fine was asking.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spanakos grew up in Red Hook, Brooklyn. He said that he had had to learn to defend himself on the streets and that he ultimately won 10 Golden Gloves matches, but fought only once professionally. Mrs. Spanakos is a guidance counselor at Intermediate School 234 in Midwood, Brooklyn, and Mr. Spanakos is the director of the Wildcat High School, a public high school in the Bronx for students who have been suspended from other schools.</p>
        <p>They have raised their children in what other Sea Gate residents dubbed the ''sugar cube,'' making little changes and repairs over time, although they installed a swimming pool a few years ago. Trees planted in front and back have diminished its stark quality.</p>
        <p>The walls have no moldings, and the house's windows are small, considering the views. The home has a somewhat spartan quality, which the Spanakoses have leavened with an eclectic collection of furniture, from a medieval-style hutch to a streamlined chrome rocker.</p>
        <p>The hanging plants are held to the ceiling by magnets, but other than that the steel construction of the house is not obvious except from the basement, where the ceiling is unpainted.</p>
        <p>On the outside, the steel panels have been bumped and shifted in a few places, but it is hard to discern their condition because they are covered with repeated coats of paint and patched with roofing tar. Mr. Spanakos said he has had few problems with the house.</p>
        <p>In 1969, he wrote the late Elliot Willensky, co-author of ''The A.I.A. Guide to New York City,'' asking Mr. Willensky to include the ''sugar cube'' in the guide. The house was not listed, but since then Mr. Spanakos has been alerting others to his unusual building.  He is also co-president of the Brooklyn Coordinating Council for the Preservation of Neighborhoods, which encourages local historical societies.</p>
        <p>In 1936 National Houses announced that it was building similar houses in Pittsburgh and in Old Greenwich, Conn., as well as in other locations, and that it was building plants in several areas around the country.  But built-in-place metal houses never became popular, although mobile homes and metal two-by-fours have become common.</p>
        <p>Mr. and Mrs. Spanakos are contemplating the future of their unusual house. Mrs. Spanakos said that because of the setting, she would hate to move. ''For me the best part is when the sky gets dark,'' she said, ''and the white boats are rushing to get back against the dark sky.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Spanakos said he would like to add a greenhouse, or a glass-and-steel third floor for a better view of the harbor. But he gets calls every few months from potential buyers, and sometimes, he said, it occurs to him that ''Brooklyn Heights would be nice, it's closer to Manhattan -- we've been thinking about it.''</p>
