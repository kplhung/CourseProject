        <p>THE GREAT CAVIAR CRACKDOWN  In recent months, a series of high-profile arrests have cast a light on the sometimes shady dealings of the international caviar trade. The industry produces about 450 tons a year, of which as much as half may be illegal trade. Counterfeiting is considered to be a chronic problem, with distributors passing off local roe as purest Russian sevruga. So is smuggling: on July 21, U.S. Caviar, a Maryland importer, pleaded guilty to federal charges that it had imported tons of illegally harvested and fraudulently labeled sturgeon roe from the Caspian Sea. And the industry has long found itself at odds with politicians, who banned Iranian caviar under a 1987 trade embargo, as well as conservation and animal rights activists, who fear for the health of sturgeon.</p>
        <p>HOW DID IT GET THIS BAD?  Like any substance that sells for as much as $95 an ounce, caviar has always attracted a criminal element. But for 71 years, one company, Petrossian, had exclusive U.S. rights to distribute caviar from Russia, the biggest source. With the breakup of the Soviet Union, however, the market has opened up -- like Pandora's box, some say. ''It was a Wild West mentality,'' says Eve Vega, executive director of Petrossian. ''Anybody who had a boat, a fishing rod and proximity to the Caspian Sea went in and got the sturgeon.'' Amid all this poaching, many male fish were killed, as were female sturgeon who had not yet reached reproductive age.</p>

        <p>THE GREAT CAVIAR CRACKDOWN  In recent months, a series of high-profile arrests have cast a light on the sometimes shady dealings of the international caviar trade.

        <p>HOW DID IT GET THIS BAD?  Like any substance that sells for as much as $95 an ounce, caviar has always attracted a criminal element. But for 71 years, one company, Petrossian, had exclusive U.S. rights to distribute caviar from Russia, the biggest source. With the breakup of the Soviet Union, however, the market has opened up -- like Pandora's box, some say. ''It was a Wild West mentality,'' says Eve Vega, executive director of Petrossian. ''Anybody who had a boat, a fishing rod and proximity to the Caspian Sea went in and got the sturgeon.'' Amid all this poaching, many male fish were killed, as were female sturgeon who had not yet reached reproductive age.</p>
        <p>MAKE WAY FOR THE FISH COPS  In 1997, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species joined their efforts with the Russian government's to protect sturgeon, which was in danger of extinction. As of April 1, 1998, any caviar brought in had to have a CITES import certificate and documents stating that it was caught legally and within quotas. The one exception was ''Pre-Convention'' inventory, a title that smugglers then used to disguise a wide array of illegal product harvested well after the cutoff date. The grandfather clause expired in December. The first prosecution under the new rules was a big one: Eugeniusz Koczuk of Stamford, Conn., was found guilty of smuggling -- with the help of off-duty airline employees -- some 21,000 pounds of Russian caviar through Kennedy Airport. He was sentenced to 20 months in federal prison and fined $25,000. At a government lab in Ashland, Ore., the Fish and Wildlife Service even uses DNA testing to confirm the precise species of any suspect shipment. (Each kind of sturgeon -- on file at the facility -- has distinct genetic markers.)</p>
        <p>OPEN YOUR WALLETS  ''We speculated at one point that because there was so much illegal caviar on the market, the dealers had been forced to lower the price a little,'' says Andrea Gaski, a senior biologist with the Fish and Wildlife Service. ''But often it was being mixed with North American stuff or poor-grade caviar.'' Because of prior overfishing, the Russians are reportedly no longer able to fill their harvest quotas. In March, the U.S. government lifted certain trade barriers, though several importers believe that the Iranian caviar coming on the market now -- at prices 30 percent above Russian competitors -- may not be the cream of the crop. But over all, there's less to go around, with a predictable effect on price. ''Our Russian beluga from the spring catch is several hundred dollars more a pound than it was last year,'' says Mark Grobman, marketing director of Browne Trading Company in Portland, Me. ''Yet our caviar sales are up 30 or 40 percent over last year. People just don't hesitate to spend the money.''</p>
        <p>IS THERE ANY GOOD NEWS FOR THE FISH?  Yes. To harvest the roe, fishermen traditionally whack an egg-bearing sturgeon on the back of the head, rip the belly open and remove the egg sac. But a technique that has, to date, been used to increase offspring may someday yield more caviar: C-sections, performed on anesthetized sturgeon that may then produce another year's yield. ''The Iranians have been doing C-sections on sturgeon for a number of years,'' Gaski says, ''but they're not sure what happens to the female with the scar tissue and formation of the eggs.'' Such kid-glove treatment may be fitting only for a fish that some say is as intelligent as a dolphin and can live as long as 150 years. ''I was shocked when I heard this,'' Vega says, ''and I don't like to tell people.''</p>
