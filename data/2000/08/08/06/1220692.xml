        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The drying up of funds for the National Loan Repayment Program and the plight of physicians like Dr. Regan Andrade (front page, July 30) is grossly unfair, but it also begs attention to a larger problem: the enormous costs of medical education in the context of trimmed doctor salaries.</p>
        <p>I am a pediatrics resident in New York City with $150,000 in educational debts, and my loan payments far exceed my paycheck of $2,000 a month. This salary, while hardly extravagant, is too high to allow me to qualify even for interest subsidization of my federal loans.</p>

        <p>Recent college graduates working in the Internet industry make six-figure salaries with no postgraduate debt whatsoever. If the economy is willing to pay out so disproportionately for Internet communications, perhaps it is time for an education tax on the Internet.</p>
