        <p>THE PLEASURE OF THEIR COMPANY</p>
        <p>By Doris Grumbach.</p>
        <p>Beacon, $22.</p>
        <p>Sitting in her favorite swivel chair overlooking Billings Cove on the coast of Maine, the novelist Doris Grumbach contemplates her 80th birthday. In a buoyant memoir, ''The Pleasure of Their Company,'' she considers the guests and ''ghosts of the nonguests'' who will attend her upcoming party, a celebration in which she has reluctantly acquiesced. Grumbach keeps intellectual company with writers whose works she admires. Rereading Proust, C. S. Lewis and Beckett, she meanders, sometimes grumpily, through a summer of ''unexpected content.'' In between worrying that swarms of mosquitoes will afflict her guests, the tent will collapse and the caterer will be a no-show, she ponders ''the scrabbly, imperfect, unsatisfactory pages'' of her current novel-in-progress. Through Berenice Abbott's black-and-white photographs, she revisits the New York of her youth; she recalls her days as proofreader in the early 1940's at Mademoiselle, where Gypsy Rose Lee and Carson McCullers regularly visited the fiction editor. She reveals an unexpectedly ardent encounter with the 72-year-old Bertrand Russell: ''This is as close as I am ever likely to come to having sex with a Nobel Prize winner.'' Confronting the limitations of the eighth decade, her honest and occasionally acid observations are laced with dry wit. As the milestone birthday approaches, in an act of ''incredibly foolish optimism,'' she trades in her aged Subaru for a brand-new Toyota and vows never to write a book about her cat. The reader doesn't want this party to be over.</p>
