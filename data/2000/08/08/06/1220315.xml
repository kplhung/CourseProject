        <p>THERE's a scene in Barry Levinson's 1987 film ''Tin Men'' in which a bunch of aluminum-siding schleppers sit around a diner, ''Broadway Danny Rose''-style, talking television westerns. One salesman complains that ''Bonanza'' is not an accurate depiction of the Old West.</p>
        <p>''You ever see the show?'' he asks. ''It's a 50-year-old father and three 47-year-old sons. You know why they get along so good? 'Cause they're all the same age.''</p>

        <p>THERE's a scene in Barry Levinson's 1987 film ''Tin Men'' in which a bunch of aluminum-siding schleppers sit around a diner, ''Broadway Danny Rose''-style, talking television westerns. One salesman complains that ''Bonanza'' is not an accurate depiction of the Old West.</p>
        <p>''You ever see the show?'' he asks. ''It's a 50-year-old father and three 47-year-old sons. You know why they get along so good? 'Cause they're all the same age.''</p>
        <p>A second salesman demurs. ''I'm not an authority like you are,'' he grumbles, ''but I occasionally watch 'Bonanza' and I think it's, like, how can you believe there's a man who got three kids by three different wives and they all died at childbirth?''</p>
        <p>''Musta been a hell of a man.''</p>
        <p>''Musta been the kiss of death.''</p>
        <p>You don't get much breakfast-booth banter in the four Hebrew horse operas being screened Tuesday night at the Jewish Museum in Manhattan. Billed as ''Wild Wild West: The Jewish Experience,'' the program comprises hourlong TV oaters with Jewish themes, including a 1963 episode of the historically dubious ''Bonanza.''</p>
        <p>''We want audiences to look critically at the way Jewish ethnicity has been represented on TV,'' said Andrew Ingall, the museum's broadcasting archivist. ''The Jewish characters on these shows are basically stereotypes. But then, all four teleplays are products of their time.''</p>
        <p>Though these gunfights at the Oy Vey Corral address every nonsecular issue from anti-Semitism (''Gunsmoke'') to intermarriage (''Little House on the Prairie''), their leaden lyricism (''She awaits us, our farm, like the Sabbath bride, scented and anointed'') is leavened by very little Jewish humor.</p>
        <p>You hope the episode of ''Gunsmoke'' will show Marshal Dillon conducting a Seder in the Dodge City jail, or Doc performing a barroom bris, or Miss Kitty getting bat mitzvahed in the Long Branch Saloon. What you get is a stilted story line about the clash between frontier justice and Talmudic law, which makes no allowances for circumstantial evidence.</p>
        <p>MARSHAL DILLON (incredulously): Three men are running around loose that murdered your boy and you're standing here playing with words?</p>
        <p>MOSHE GOROFSKY (pedagogically): Words! Some we live by, and some we must die for.</p>
        <p>Each of the Jewish TV families facing these problems is ruled by a bearded Yiddisher with an accent as thick as pumpernickel and syntax as twisted as kugel noodles. ''A man tell me the ground in Dakota is black like swamp and fat like grease and there are no bosses,'' says Papa Kleinfeld in a 1954 Philco Television Playhouse production. ''There are not enough people for there to have bosses.''</p>
        <p>Each patriarch is a stern, intractable scholar who knows God on a first-name basis. ''He's a wise sage trying to preserve Jewish values -- honesty, devotion, compassion -- while surrounded by immoral outlaws,'' observes the comic Jackie Mason, an expert on Jewish Westerns by virtue of numerous appearances on ''The Ed Sullivan Show,'' a CBS neighbor of ''Gunsmoke.''  ''Today, it would be like an Old World rabbi arguing with Bill Clinton.''</p>
        <p>These Jewish fathers have brought their familes to the New West to escape the pogroms and harassment of the Old East. Exodus parallels are drawn so freely, you feel like you're in a Leon Uris novel. The Philco Playhouse narrator intones: ''Papa led us out of Chicago like Moses freeing the children of Israel.''</p>
        <p>As with Moses, a little blood is spilled -- in this case, Papa's. Shamed by his wife's reluctance to assimilate with other ''greenhorns'' of the 1850's, Papa Kleinfeld stomps out of the homestead and beds down on the plains, where he promptly burns to death in a brush fire.</p>
        <p>What Papa's hard work didn't accomplish, his sacrifice does. Mama embraces the idea of 1950's ecumenicalism and holds a prairie Passover service. Among the guests are a Norwegian and a Native American in full headdress -- a sight only slightly less incongruous than the appearance of a Yiddish-speaking Indian chief in Mel Brook's ''Blazing Saddles.''</p>
        <p>''After World War II, multiculturalism was valued by the liberal Jewish community,'' Mr. Ingall said. ''Jews wanted to participate in the same rituals with some boundaries.''</p>
        <p>Bonanzologists still debate the boundaries of the Ponderosa, though most agree Ben Cartwright's ranch must have been roughly the size of Mesopotamia. In the episode under consideration, the traveling salesman Aaron Kaufman and his Jewish mother of a daughter camp at the spread for the Sabbath.</p>
        <p>P APA, you always do nothing,'' scolds his daughter. ''The world spills scalding hot soup all over you, and you stick out your tongue and lick it and say, 'Thank you.' ''</p>
        <p>When the wandering Jews are held up by outlaws, Papa holds his tongue. Defying his Old Testament teachings, he becomes a kind of Billy the Kibbitzer, popping off the bandits as easily as if he were shooting lox in a barrel.</p>
        <p>''You got 'em both, Mr. Kaufman,'' Adam Cartwright says. ''That's pretty good shooting.''</p>
        <p>''Good shooting?'' says the angst-ridden peddler. ''I killed two men!''</p>
        <p>No such moral qualms afflict the avenging farm boy Richard Dreyfuss played a decade later on ''Gunsmoke.'' Gershon Gorofsky confronts his brother's killers with a shotgun and threatens to blow them away. ''The show was filmed shortly after Israel won the Six Day War,'' Mr. Ingall said. ''Dreyfuss's feisty farmer reflected the New Jew -- the young, macho Israeli filled with ethnic pride and willing to take the law into his own hands.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mason does not argue this point. He does dispute the farmer part.</p>
        <p>''Jews in the Wild West did not generally own farms or ranches,'' he contends. ''Jews have never been into that line of work. O.K., so there used to be some Jewish chicken farmers in Jersey. Maybe because they didn't have to lift nothin' heavy or get dirty. But very seldom did you see Jewish ranchers or Jewish cowboys. It was almost always a Gentile riding the horse or poking the cow or flying from the trees. As soon as a Jew got dirt on himself, he sold the ranch.''</p>
