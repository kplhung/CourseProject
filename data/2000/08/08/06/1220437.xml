        <p>IN the 10 years that Anna and Peter Bakst waited to buy their dream house, Mrs. Bakst regularly clipped architectural and decorating ideas from magazines. So by the time they finally bought, they pretty much knew exactly what they wanted. Which is why after buying a 4,200-square-foot condominium in SoHo in 1997 they were content to wait almost a year to move in while the contractor transformed a virtually empty space into a home for themselves and their two young sons.</p>
        <p>''It was a fairly high-end job, because we had been waiting 10 years,'' said Mrs. Bakst, the president of the accessories and footwear division of the Donna Karan fashion house. ''But it was worth the wait and the investment.''</p>
        <p>With loft prices soaring in lower Manhattan in the last few years, the Baksts' purchase of an unfinished condo in a former manufacturing building was indeed a solid investment. While Mrs. Bakst declined to give the price of her 10th-floor apartment, real estate brokers say that condos  in her building -- the 12-story New Museum building at 158 Mercer Street, between Prince and Houston Streets -- have tripled or quadrupled in price since they came on the market as raw space in 1997.</p>
        <p>''Back then,'' said Helene Luchnick, a senior vice president of the Douglas Elliman brokerage concern, who was showing a recent visitor around a 4,500-square-foot four-bedroom apartment in the New Museum building, ''this loft sold for $1.65 million raw. It just closed for $6.75 million.''</p>
        <p>Despite the high prices, developers say there appears to be no shortage of customers for raw-space condos. A number of buildings in which apartments are delivered as raw space have sold out within months of going on the market, the developers say, while some raw-space buildings now under development have waiting lists.</p>
        <p>The purchase price is only part of the cost of buying what is called raw space, ''white space'' or ''white raw.''  The cost of turning raw space into bedrooms, dining rooms, living rooms, kitchens, bathrooms, closets and the other comforts of home can easily amount to as much as the sale price.</p>
        <p>''With raw space you're basically buying four walls, floor and ceiling, so depending on what you plan to do with it, it can be expensive,'' said Steven M. Lamazor, the president of Taocon Inc., a Manhattan construction company that specializes in residential and commercial renovations. ''We just finished two $1 million renovations.''</p>
        <p>While the cost of transforming raw space into a finished home is typically at least $200 a square foot, Angelo Cosentini, a developer and the vice president of On the Level Enterprises, a construction company, said that he is doing a renovation in TriBeCa for $500 a square foot. ''And we're doing a 3,000-square-foot loft where the plumbing alone is $200,000,'' he added.</p>
        <p>The transformation from raw space to a finished home costs as much as it does, brokers and builders say, because many owners want the very best. ''Everybody wants to see their home in Architectural Digest,'' Mr. Lamazor said. The number of people with both the desire for showcase homes and pockets deep enough to pay whatever it takes has allowed contractors who specialize in such work to be selective. ''We're basically taking only jobs of at least $1 million or $2 million,'' Mr. Lamazor said, except for repeat clients.</p>
        <p>Decades ago, in some of the neighborhoods where million-dollar-and-up apartments are now common, artists, bohemians and those down on their luck lived in lofts or abandoned buildings with just the bare necessities, if that.</p>
        <p>Alex Katz and Al Held, artists who were then teaching at Yale, bought an entire building in SoHo in 1968. The price was so low that even now Mr. Katz is reluctant to say what they paid for it, other than that ''it was very little'' and that he was very lucky.  He and his wife live in the same 5,000-square-foot co-op penthouse to this day; a co-op of similar size two blocks away sold for $6.4 million last year.</p>
        <p>When lofts became highly popular in the 1970's, they were converted to co-ops, said Jan Hashey, a senior vice president at Douglas Elliman who specializes in the sale of raw space. A 3,100-square-foot loft in NoHo, Ms. Hashey's first raw-space sale, sold for $31,000 in the 70's, or $10 a square foot.  Today, she said, a similar property in NoHo would likely sell for $1.3 million.</p>
        <p>On Crosby Street in SoHo, where Ms. Hashey still lives in a loft she bought in 1977 for $15,000 -- and where she spent $75,000 more to bring it up to city requirements for a residence -- a penthouse in a raw-space condominium recently went to contract at $8.5 million.</p>
        <p>LOFTS continued to increase in popularity and price until the real-estate market soured in the late 1980's, after which  loans for such conversions were hard to come by. By the time the economy had turned around in the 1990's, raw-space co-ops had generally fallen out of favor, in part because co-op purchasers do not own the property -- they purchase stock in the co-op corporation, which entitles them to a proprietary lease to occupy the apartment. When the market recovered, developers and real-estate agents say, the co-op form of ownership yielded to the condominium, which imposes far fewer restrictions on buyers.</p>
        <p>As Manhattan became safer and cleaner,  families and others seeking large amounts of space were drawn to SoHo, NoHo, TriBeCa, Chelsea and the Flatiron and financial districts, home to an estimated 90 percent of the dormant factories and warehouses that could be converted into lofts.</p>
        <p>Those factories and warehouses not only have lots of space, many have ceilings up to 16 feet high, panoramic windows, Grecian columns, brick walls and maple floors.  These days many raw-space condos also have wood-burning fireplaces, dedicated basement storage, modern elevators, common terraces and roof gardens as well as supers and door attendants.</p>
        <p>And raw space is no longer synonymous with converted onetime loft buildings. The 28 apartments in the two sleek 15-story towers designed by Richard Meier that are to rise at 173 and 176 Perry Street in the far west area of Greenwich Village are to be delivered as raw space, at prices of up to $8 million.</p>
        <p>Location can also be a major factor in the lure of raw-space lofts.</p>
        <p>''When I saw that view of the Hudson, in one minute I said to the broker, 'I'll take it,' '' said Roy Liebenthal, the owner of PoP and Lemon restaurants.</p>
        <p>Mr. Liebenthal paid $1.7 million for his fourth-floor condo in an 11-story building at 495 West Street in the West Village. Then he spent $750,000 more renovating it. Now, Mr. Liebenthal said, he and his companion, Fabienne Terwinghe, a model, couldn't be happier. ''From our condo,'' he said, ''we can see only green trees, water and boats.  It's like living on vacation.''</p>
        <p>For developers, one attraction of delivering apartments as raw space is that such buildings take less time to complete than do those with finished layouts and equipment. ''And it's much less challenging for developers than finished space, no muss, no fuss,'' said Jane Gladstein, an executive vice president of Corcoran Group Marketing.</p>
        <p>Cary Tamarkin, the architect and developer whose conversion at 140 Perry Street is generally credited with bringing raw space back into vogue in 1996 after it had fallen out of favor a decade or so earlier, said that there were pitfalls for prospective buyers. ''Raw space costs less and takes less time if your only concern is the balance sheet,'' he said. ''That's why you see a lot of schlock out there. ''</p>
        <p>Rob Tiburzi, a developer with Houlihan-Parnes Realtors, suggested another motive for developers' penchant for raw space. In at least half the high-end loft conversions in Chelsea a few years ago, he said, buyers were substituting their own preferences for the finished space. ''So,'' Mr. Tiburzi said, ''the developers thought, why should I spend the money on finished space when it's just going to be tossed away?''</p>
        <p>And James Lansill, director of development for Stribling &amp; Associates, proffered a somewhat similar explanation. ''Some developers,'' he said, ''are inflicting their own vision, so people buy them to gut them.''</p>
        <p>And some buyers, according to Edward Ferris, a broker with the William B. May Company, will pay a premium for a blank canvas: ''Raw space is appealing to people who don't want to pay for other people's work. So they're willing to pay the same as others pay for finished space.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lansill oversees sales and marketing for the raw-space loft condos under construction at the Cooper Square buildings that until last year had been the home of Carl Fischer Inc., a music publisher for 76 years. Residential space at the 12-story building at 62 Cooper Street, whose exterior is adorned by a distinctive large clock in the shape of an eighth note, will range from 7,385 square feet per floor to 8,404 square feet, while residential space at the two vacant adjoining four-story buildings is 3,250 square feet per floor. No price has been established for the condos, pending acceptance of the offering plan.</p>
        <p>The Atalanta, a 17-story building being  converted into 43 raw-space condos at North Moore and Varick Streets in TriBeCa, went on the market two months ago, and, according to Mr. Tiburzi, one of its developers, ''We're going to contract with five buyers who are paying in excess of $5 million each.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Luchnick of Douglas Elliman said that at 6,900 square feet, the price for each of those properties -- in what had been the home of the Merchants Refrigerating Company -- works out to an average of $800 a square foot.</p>
        <p>In Chelsea, 5,720-square-foot residential condos in the 12-story City Prairie at 206 West 17th Street -- the renamed former business offices of Barneys, the fashion retailer -- range in price from $1.65 million to $6.25 million for the penthouse, which includes an additional 3,500 square feet of private roof deck. While the average price for the 11 condos is $520 a square foot, according to Mr. Tamarkin, the architect and developer, the penthouse price will work out to a lofty $1,000 a square foot for the residential space.</p>
        <p>Unlike buying a completed apartment, buying raw space is only the beginning of a time-consuming and expensive process, one that many apartment-seekers would have no patience for.</p>
        <p>''Many of them are extremely busy,'' said Ms. Gladstein of the Corcoran Group, ''so they're not inclined to spend millions buying lofts, then pay a minimum of $200 a square foot fixing them up and then having to wait at least nine months to move in. We counsel clients that it's a daunting prospect for most people.''</p>
        <p>As happy as Mrs. Bakst, the Donna Karan executive, is with her former raw space home, she acknowledges that even though she and her husband (an investment banker) hired an architect, an interior designer and a well-recommended contractor, the conversion was often stressful.</p>
        <p>''Even though I had in mind what I wanted, I'm also a working woman, so I needed somebody to come to me with ideas so I could pick from them,'' she said. ''And as the project moves along, there are a lot of technical details that require an engineer to come in and work out, like where your pipes go when you want a bathroom here instead of there, or where to put the heating and cooling system.''</p>
        <p>BECAUSE her sister had already developed a couple of raw spaces, Mrs. Bakst's experience was less onerous than it might have been. In addition to having already done her homework about what she wanted, she knew the importance of having detailed architectural plans for the contractor and of being resigned to wait.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Bakst also knew -- or does now -- that for all her planning, there are the inevitable changes. ''Once you're done with it you look and say I'd probably have done this or that differently,'' she said. ''For one thing, I would probably have made the size of the boys' bedrooms more equal.''</p>
        <p>But the biggest lessons she learned, she said, were not with space but with time and money. ''Assume every estimate will cost 25 to 50 percent more and that it will take 25 to 50 percent longer,'' she said.</p>
        <p>She also has few illusions that the money spent on improvements, as opposed to the appreciation of the real estate, will reap huge dividends. ''I think that generally whatever return you get if you sell is because of the space, not because of what you put into it,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Buyers of raw space need to have enough cash in hand, after paying the mortgage, to pay for the construction.</p>
        <p>While most banks usually do not give both a mortgage for buying the property and another loan for construction, Neil Bader, the president of IPI Skyscraper Mortgage, said there are banks known to most mortgage brokers that will make construction loans. Such loans typically cost one-half a percentage point more than a home mortgage, Mr. Bader added, and the money is given to the borrower as the work proceeds.</p>
        <p>Developers and architects who specialize in raw space acknowledge that its appeal is limited both by geography and by the unwillingness of most buyers to spend the time and put up with the frustration.</p>
        <p>But within that limited market, architects, developers and builders say they are confident raw space will remain popular.  For example, Mr. Tamarkin said he is ''definitely considering raw space'' for his proposed development at 91st Street and Madison Avenue, which was turned down in June by the Landmarks Preservation Commission but is being redesigned.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't need to be confined to old warehouses,'' he said. ''You can do it in an apartment house, if you do it in style. And if you do it in style, it will appeal to people who can afford it and are willing to go through what it takes to finish it the way they want.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lamazor, the contractor, cited another reason raw space is not likely to disappear. ''More and more people with money want something beautiful,'' he said. ''Not long ago it was a $2 million work of art.  But the $2 million works of art being commissioned now have walls, floors and roofs, and instead of being done by painters they're designed by architects.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 27, 2000, Sunday  An article on Aug. 6 about raw space referred incorrectly to the residence of Jan Hashey, a broker who discussed the history of the conversion of lofts into apartments. She no longer lives in the Crosby Street loft in SoHo that she bought in 1977. She moved to the far West Village in 1996.</p>
