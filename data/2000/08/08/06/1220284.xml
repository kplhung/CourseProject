        <p>THREE years after the Environmental Protection Agency launched a broad program to better protect the public from the hazards of sewage and other pollution at beaches, there has been only scattered progress on a number of fronts.</p>
        <p>With the summer recreation season now at its peak, it is still difficult for people in many places to find out at a particular time whether the local water is clean enough for safe swimming. Some states have improved notification procedures and some have tightened standards for testing water for pathogens, but others have not.</p>
        <p>Many people never consider that the surf may not always be clean enough to swim in, and data collected by the E.P.A. shows that problems are widespread. In its latest annual survey of both coasts and the Great Lakes region, the agency found that state and local authorities closed or posted warnings at 459 beaches at least once last year -- almost one out of four of the 1,891 beaches surveyed.</p>
        <p>The Environmental Protection Agency's  data showed that California had 182 beaches reporting at least one closure or warning during 1999. That's far more than the runners-up, Florida with 48 and Illinois with 46. New Jersey had 19, and New York 11. But state-to-state comparisons are difficult, because different states have different rules for testing the waters and responding to the test results.</p>
        <p>The agency said that the percent of beaches with polluted water was ''essentially the same as last year.'' Amy Gambrill, an official in the agency's water office, said the main problem was bacteria in the water coming from sewage overflows and runoffs after storms.</p>
        <p>Many beaches are frequently contaminated when untreated sewage flows into the ocean, carrying a variety of bacteria, viruses, protozoa and parasites that can cause illnesses ranging from diarrhea to hepatitis. The contamination can last for several days after each overflow.</p>
        <p>But much of what the agency has been trying to accomplish for the last three years to protect the public remains undone. About a third of the local jurisdictions surveyed have not yet adopted the E.P.A.'s criteria for monitoring water quality, which call for testing five times a month for E. coli (at freshwater beaches, such as the Great Lakes) and enterococcus bacteria (in ocean waters). At 5 percent of beaches, the water is sampled only after heavy rains or known spills.</p>
        <p>This summer, the agency will propose tighter standards against sewage overflows. And it recently completed its final storm-water regulations to better control runoff after heavy rains. Both steps should lead to fewer spills.</p>
        <p>President Clinton has also ordered the agency to come up with new offshore ocean water-quality standards, similar to those that govern freshwater rivers and lakes. And by next spring the E.P.A. expects to complete new guidelines for states on beach water quality. But all these regulations will take time to go into full force. Meanwhile, Congress has not acted on legislation, under consideration for several years, that would require state and local governments to follow uniform standards and make public announcements whenever beach waters are polluted.</p>
        <p>In most parts of the country there is no simple and reliable way for vacationers to find out about water quality at individual beaches. The Environmental Protection Agency generally recommends that people call the local department of public health or state department of natural resources. Agency officials said that people should avoid swimming shortly after heavy rains.</p>
        <p>The Clean Beaches Council, a nonprofit organization, has what it calls a Blue Wave program under which it has certified 30 beaches in 7 states as meeting its criteria for water quality and other standards. The organization works with state and local environmental authorities to verify compliance and lists certified beaches at www.cleanbeaches.org.</p>
        <p>Some states -- notably California, under a new state law -- are expanding their monitoring of beach waters and creating systems for letting the public know when the water is not safe, both by making announcements in the news media and by posting current data on the Web.</p>
        <p>But without uniform requirements under federal law, these systems are spotty at best.</p>
        <p>In Florida, for example, several counties post the results of bacteria sampling at their most popular beaches at www.doh.state .fl.us/environment/beach/default.html. But there is no law or source of money to allow for a statewide program, according to Robert Nobles of the state's health office.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A. also has a Web site, and for years has been promising to post current water conditions nationwide there, giving everybody a single place to check for water conditions. But agency officials said it was likely to be at least another year before that happens. Meanwhile, the Web site contains only data from the annual survey of beaches -- something that is of little use to somebody planning a weekend getaway.</p>
        <p>TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT  Correction:  August 20, 2000, Sunday  The Correspondent's Report column on Aug. 6, about detecting and disclosing water pollution at beaches in the United States, included an outdated reference to testing in Florida. A state law indeed exists; it was enacted in June to provide comprehensive testing by coastal counties, and participation in the program began on Aug. 1.</p>
