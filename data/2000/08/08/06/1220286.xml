        <p>SYDNEY, a diverse city of some four million inhabitants, offers a variety of cafes and restaurants to suit all tastes and budgets, satisfying even the most exigent and adventurous of diners. Visitors can sample the foods of 50 different nationalities, from Laotian larb to Mexican mole, from English pork pies to Vietnamese pho.</p>
        <p>Some of Sydney's most memorable eating is cheap -- fish 'n' chips on the beach, pie 'n' sauce from Harry's Cafe de Wheels in Woolloomooloo. The restaurants here, however, represent the other end of the spectrum, Sydney establishments renowned for the excellence of their kitchens and cellars.</p>
        <p>Tetsuya's</p>
        <p>Entering is to embark on a gastronomic adventure. This is no conventional restaurant -- it has no written menu and no standard three-course meal. In the domain of the chef Tetsuya Wakuda, the diner does not command the kitchen but rather succumbs to its spell.</p>
        <p>The restaurant offers a set menu of either 13 (dinner) or 8 (lunch) courses, each minuscule, with some choices -- in the case of an allergy to crustaceans, for example. The staff recites the dishes.</p>
        <p>Even so, it is impossible to anticipate the courses, either in appearance or flavor: ''two little soups'' gives no clue to the artful presentation nor to the unexpected flavor contrasts of first, cold leek and potato soup on soft slivers of jellied eggplant, in a tiny shot glass, plus a creamy puree of avocado topped with a dollop of salty caviar in a delicate ceramic bowl.</p>
        <p>A carefully composed concerto of taste delights begins with cold, Japanese-style dishes, eaten with chopsticks, and progresses through warm and hot French-influenced dishes to a selection of desserts. Tetsuya's cuisine, sometimes described as French-Japanese, reflects a highly intelligent and discriminating palate combined with a perfectionist's attention to detail, demonstrated, for example, in the tiniest dab of tapenade enhancing the tataki of tuna, one of a trio of bite-size raw fish variations.</p>
        <p>It would take far too long to describe each dish, and in any case, the menu might vary. Among the most memorable was the opening prelude of tartare of scampi with tomato sorbet, served in a martini glass, the crest of scarlet on translucent white giving it the appearance of a fresh scallop. The sorbet, not too icy, was both slightly sweet and rich, the very essence of tomatoes, and blended beautifully with the scampi flesh.</p>
        <p>Also unforgettable was the seared fillet of veal with puree of potato and shiitake, a fine disc of tender pink veal on a similar disc of creamy potato, the whole enlivened with a dash of truffle oil.</p>
        <p>A fixture on the menu is Tetsuya's signature dish, confit of Tasmanian ocean trout with unpasteurized ocean trout roe and marinated celery. Very slowly cooked in olive oil, the fish acquires a meltingly soft texture; it is served in slices, crusted with fine flakes of konbu (a form of seaweed), on thin, crunchy slices of marinated celery with a hint of lime. The trout, by itself, is disappointingly bland; but take a mouthful of fish, seaweed crust and celery and the whole fairly sparkles on the palate. Paired with the recommended wine, Henschke ''Joseph Hill'' gewurztraminer, the result is pure sensation.</p>
        <p>The gewurztraminer is one of a dozen or so wines available by the glass ($4.65 to $7, at the exchange rate of $1.72 to the American dollar). Diners may opt for half-glasses of nine different wines, or full glasses of three or four different wines. In addition, Tetsuya's boasts an excellent cellar, including fine vintages of Krug champagne and Grange Hermitage, and it allows people to bring their own wine (corkage is $11 a bottle).</p>
        <p>Finally, I must mention one particular dessert, a floating island with vanilla bean and praline anglaise. The description belies the inventiveness and skill of this masterpiece: a swirl of praline- and vanilla-flavored custards around a molded tower of poached unsweetened meringue, which, when broached, revealed molten cores of chocolate and raspberry puree.</p>
        <p>Tetsuya's, in a narrow, two-story building on an unprepossessing suburban street in Rozelle, west of downtown, will move to larger premises closer to the city center around October.</p>
        <p>MG Garage</p>
        <p>It's not often one dines at a restaurant where the most expensive item on the menu, costing $25,360, is a car -- in particular, an MGF 1.8i. It's on display, too, gleaming black between dining tables, offering irresistible temptation to some, who pause to stroke its sleek flanks.</p>
        <p>The restaurant, MG Garage, displaced a car showroom in the Surry  Hills neighborhood almost three years ago, and under the direction of the chef Janni Kyritsis, rapidly became one of Sydney's fashionable favorites. It is a comfortable spot; diners are greeted with a welcoming smile, and white-jacketed waiters display an affable courtesy.</p>
        <p>Somber grays and black predominate in three dining areas, separated from the kitchen by a long bar. From the banquettes opposite, one can catch glimpses of the kitchen; it gives the impression of efficiency, discipline and order.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kyritsis' cuisine pays homage to classic French techniques and combinations with a sure-handed originality that sometimes reflects his Mediterranean origins. His wide-ranging menu proposes 10 entrees (as appetizers are called in Australia) and 10 main courses, with vegetarian dishes by request.</p>
        <p>For a Southern Hemisphere winter dinner, a tiny tureen of fennel soup with crunchy chunks of almond and a thin slice of toasted almond bread was offered as an appetizer. The first course was Sicilian stuffed red mullet, a plump, crisp-skinned, boned fish filled with a typically Sicilian combination of currants, pine nuts and bread crumbs. Agreeably permeating the fine white flesh, the currant sweetness was beautifully balanced by the salty, sharp salad of flat-leaf parsley, black olives, tiny capers and small dice of preserved lemon.</p>
        <p>More substantial was the entree of quail and pig trotter sausage encased in vine leaves, appropriately seasoned with a perfect blend of Moroccan spices.</p>
        <p>Main courses display a bold individuality -- braised ocean trout wrapped in sorrel with anchovies and capers, roast pigeon with braised pine mushrooms and white polenta. My friend and I chose galantine and leg ham of suckling pig poached on a bed of Lucerne hay and covered with another layer of the hay, and bacon-and-herb-crumbed fillet of rabbit with liver faggots -- patties of liver wrapped in crepine (caul fat) -- betrayed a hint of charcuterie influence.</p>
        <p>The galantine was a rolled loin of pork, its stuffing seasoned with spices, its outer edge a layer of the most succulent, richest-tasting fat imaginable. The delicate pink ham, presented on a nest of hay, served as a counterpoint, as did the finely shredded cabbage tossed with citrus segments.</p>
        <p>The rabbit of the second main course -- small, lightly crusted medallions of tender white meat -- was slightly disappointing, with little distinctive flavor; but the liver faggots, enveloped in the finest film of crepine,  were superbly satisfying, especially with the accompaniments of fresh spinach and a good reduction sauce.</p>
        <p>We settled for a single shared dessert: a themed medley of deep pink poached quince, a quiveringly soft mound of pale, milky blancmange, and a warm quince tart with buttery almond pastry and touch of cinnamon.</p>
        <p>The wine list is international but sensibly short, though supplemented by a cellar list of older vintages. A dozen or so Australian and imported wines are available by the glass, among them a delicately aromatic Alsatian riesling ($4.65 a glass, $20.50 a bottle).</p>
        <p>Forty One</p>
        <p>Boldly positioned atop one of Sydney's prestigious business buildings, Forty One Restaurant is strangely reticent, its entrance so discreet as to be almost overlooked -- but perhaps this is in deference to Sydney Harbour, which brooks no opposition. At night, the wall of windows looks over the darkened Domain toward the classical facade of the Art Gallery of New South Wales and, beyond, the myriad points of light of Sydney's eastern suburbs.</p>
        <p>Forty One spells style with a capital S, all elegance and understated chic, from marble of deepest jade green to warm blond wood, from fine china to Alessi pepper grinders. A wide, graceful central staircase links the main dining area and kitchens, on the upper level, with the bar and lower dining area. Tables are placed  so that each enjoys the spectacular views, and are set far enough apart for conversations to remain private.</p>
        <p>Its wine menu, over 30 pages, also sets Forty One apart from most Sydney restaurants. For some fine Australian wines, like Penfold's Grange Hermitage and Henschke Hill of Grace, a sequence of vintages is available -- from 1962 for the Grange, from 1972 for the Hill of Grace.</p>
        <p>Our choice for the meal was a Shiraz, 1995 Crozes l'Hermitage Thalabert P. Jaboulet ($42). Carefully decanted, it was poured into large-bowled, fine-stemmed tasting glasses, all the better for savoring its aroma of rich dark cherries.</p>
        <p>It is difficult to categorize Forty One's cuisine -- if anything, one could describe it as international haute cuisine -- and while all dishes were perfectly executed and ingredients and skill were of the highest quality, to me it lacked a distinctive personality. For some dishes, individual components were excellent but the whole was less successful, as in roast Chinese duck with a quesadilla of foie gras and braised spinach.</p>
        <p>My first course of Tasmanian salmon variations, with a shot of vodka, consisted of three tiny mounds: raw salmon, on thin noodles; cured salmon, with a dill crust and dill oil; and cubes of superbly smoked salmon with avocado. After an interval came a kind of palate cleanser, a cup of duck consomme, lively with the tang of fresh ginger; delicious, but I wondered how it related to the courses to follow -- in my case, wild barramundi (a native Australian fish) fillet with asparagus and summer truffles, the latter distinctively aromatic but contributing little to flavor.</p>
        <p>The barramundi came with a crisp crust on the firm white flesh, surrounded by thin disks of potato (and truffle), tomato dice and small chanterelles (air-freighted from France). Another main course was a crown roast of wild hare, cooked rare and accompanied by braised Belgian endive and chartreuse jus.</p>
        <p>From an admirable array of Australian and French cheeses, I enjoyed an ash-covered Selles-sur-Cher goat cheese with crisp biscuits, fresh grapes, dates and dried apricots. My companion plumped for the Valrhona chocolate tart, rich and dense, but too chocolaty for my palate; in this case, less would have meant more.</p>
        <p>bel mondo</p>
        <p>In the heart of Sydney's historic Rocks district, bel mondo occupies a solid sandstone building, which in the early days of the colony, held its vitally important grain stores. The restaurant is reminiscent of a medieval barn, with high ceilings and dark timber beams (plus the modern touch of gunmetal gray plumbing) emphasizing its qualities of tradition and simplicity, evident also in the northern Italian-inspired cuisine of the chefs, Stefano and Franca Manfredi. The kitchen, to one side, is semi-open and slightly raised above the level of the tables, allowing diners a view.</p>
        <p>In such a busy, bustling establishment, service from white-shirted, black-waistcoated waiters is remarkably prompt and efficient. The menu is arranged as antipasto, zuppa, primi, pasta and secondi, with salads and vegetables available as side orders.</p>
        <p>My meal began with an appetizer of carpaccio of tuna and swordfish, with a green olive caponata, a handsome still-life composition. The thin slices of fish, translucent and rosy-red, covered the base of a plain white plate while around the rim were scattered pieces of dark-skinned eggplant, celery and tiny capers of the sweet-sour caponata accompaniment. The soup was quail and borlotti bean, with mushroom crostini -- homely and satisfyingly meaty but not too filling.</p>
        <p>The restaurant proposes a daunting catalogue of Australian and imported wines, with a strong emphasis on Italian regional wines, and features a wine maker of the season; when I visited, this was Wayne Stehbens of Katnook Estate. Preferring the by-the-glass option, and with advice from knowledgeable and well-trained staff, we sampled an Italian white, Erbaluce di Caluso, from Piedmont ($6.60), an Australian red made from the popular Italian nebbiolo, barbera and sangiovese grapes ($6.30), and a merlot from the Katnook range ($12).</p>
        <p>This last accompanied a plate of roast Illabo lamb, young suckling lamb from New South Wales, cooked with rosemary and served with roast potatoes. While very lean and tender, it lacked the succulence and distinctive flavor I associate with milk-fed lamb. Another main course, grilled marron (indigenous freshwater crayfish) and calamari, came in a light tomato-saffron sauce with an unusual (and somewhat extraneous) accompaniment of roast parsnips.</p>
        <p>The eight dolci, or desserts, display variations on classic Italian themes -- like a chestnut and caramel pannacotta with persimmon, a combination that proved surprisingly successful. Whole poached chestnuts, chestnut puree and tiny biscotti complemented the platter.</p>
