        <p>FOUR years ago, Lisa Heller, then a speech instructor at the University of Richmond, was astounded by all the perfectly good futons, lamps and even computers being tossed curbside when new graduates vacated their dormitory rooms.</p>
        <p>''Often they have less than 12 hours to get out of their dorms,'' she said. ''It kind of becomes an abandon-ship mentality.'' Given her pack rat habits, she could not resist the resultant treasure trove.</p>
        <p>''I just started picking stuff up in my little Honda Civic and driving it home and storing it in my living room,'' much to the dismay of her roommates at the time, she said. For two years, she held a yard sale with the bounty. Then, with the help of student members of the Sierra Club, she turned it into a charity event called the Recycle Sale.</p>
        <p>Ms. Heller left her job in Virginia this year and moved to New England, where she has organized Dump &amp; Run Inc., a nonprofit service to collect students' castoffs in the spring and sell them to incoming students in the fall, with the proceeds going to charity. Tufts University in Medford, Mass., is her current testing ground. The items she collected at the end of the past school year -- currently stored in her barn -- will be sold on Labor Day weekend, just in time for freshmen to snap up some bargains.</p>
        <p>The day after the Tufts sale, Ms. Heller will begin teaching a class in rhetoric at Bates College in Lewiston, Me. Not surprisingly, she is hoping to initiate a Recycle Sale there as well.</p>
        <p>Among the items stockpiled for the Tufts sale, the selection ranges from dormitory room staples, like inflatable furniture, microwaves, fans and halogen lamps (the ones that violate most college fire codes), to Russian soup mix and a framed seashell collage. And those dry-erase boards that hang on dormitory room doors? ''We have tons of those,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Selling half-full bottles of laundry detergent for $1, working hair dryers for $5 or mini-refrigerators for $25 to $50 did more than net $2,700 for charity at Richmond this year. The university also enjoyed a classic benefit of recycling: It cut its post-student-evacuation trash pickups in half.</p>
        <p>Ms. Heller said that while Dump &amp; Run is not her full-time job, she is going to be working hard to get more schools to join. She said her goal is to have 10 schools running Dump &amp; Run sales by next spring.</p>
        <p>Ms. Heller has already made great strides since her first year. Now, instead of picking through garbage, she solicits donations from students and will even make house calls to pick up goods. She pretty much runs the show, with the help of student volunteers. The proceeds from the Tufts sale will benefit Planet Aid, which helps needy communities in Africa.</p>
