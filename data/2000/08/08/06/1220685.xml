        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>Mike Piazza rules in our house, but Melvin Mora was still a favorite of my 6-year-old son, Tim. During our daily Whiffle ball games, when his team needed to start a rally, he would often cup his hands and mimic the Shea Stadium announcer: ''Now batting, No. 6, Melvin Mora.'' But each time he did it last weekend I had to remind him sadly that one of his favorites was traded, gone. By Sunday night, however, Tim had made the adjustment. With the score tied, 3-3, going into the ninth, he eyed me menacingly as he raised his hands to his mouth: ''Now pinch-hitting, No. 17, Mike Bordick.''</p>
