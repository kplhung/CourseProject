        <p>On a recent Monday morning, many Park Slope car owners awoke to find a decade of prayers answered. Under new street cleaning regulations posted along the curbs, their parked cars would have to be moved only once a week from each side of the street,  instead of twice.</p>
        <p>In a city where grime invades every crack and fissure, car owners in Park Slope, as well as Carroll Gardens and Cobble Hill,  had long argued that their streets were cleaned too often. Armed with petitions signed by people tired of moving their cars to make way for street sweeping machines, Community Board 6 lobbied for years to persuade the city's Department of Sanitation to reduce the number of cleaning days.</p>
        <p>''This is a service paid for by taxpayers,'' said Craig Hammerman, the board's district manager. ''Shouldn't the taxpayers have some say in how the service is provided?''</p>
        <p>Peter Fenty, a spokesman for the Sanitation Department, said the change, in about 34 blocks, from Fourth to Sixth Avenues and Union to 14th Streets, was a six-month experiment, the first of its kind in the city.</p>
        <p>Street cleaning, with its accompanying parking restrictions, has been a part of city life since 1950, when the first sweepers with mechanical brooms were introduced on the Lower East Side, replacing hand brooms and water trucks that sprayed the streets.</p>
        <p>By 1953, mechanical sweepers were the standard in all boroughs except Staten Island, which still does not have them, except in commercial areas. Yet, with its sparser population, Staten Island consistently wins the highest marks for cleanliness.</p>
        <p>The average mechanical sweeper lumbers along at two to three miles per hour, cleaning about 12 miles of curb a day. To make way for them, parked cars must be moved from one side of the street for the times posted on signs.</p>
        <p>For years, the periods were three hours for residential areas and one hour for commercial districts, but in 1994 the city began to cut the times to 90 minutes for residential and 30 minutes for commercial areas.</p>
        <p>''Those old three-hour limits really weren't helpful to the merchants or the community,'' Mr. Fenty said.</p>
        <p>Thirty-three of the city's 59 community board districts have switched to the shorter sweeping periods; the rest will do so within two years. ''City residents have really embraced the program,'' Mr. Fenty said, adding that a request for less service was rare.</p>
        <p>Loretta Mau, who lives on 13th Street and owns three cars, was so relieved at the change to two days of cleaning that she had been sweeping the street herself to help persuade the department to make it permanent. Before, ''there were almost killings for parking spots,'' she said. ''Now, it's much better.''</p>
