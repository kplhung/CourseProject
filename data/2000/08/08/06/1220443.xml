        <p>SO . . . Do you or don't you wish to enter the Land of Chocolate?'' Rei Prabhakar asked as I took a seat at his tiny restaurant here. I watched as he knelt beside his customers, observed his true-believer expression, and wondered where I was headed here at Karen and Rei's. As I looked around, I saw other waiters similarly poised on a knee beside their tables.</p>
        <p>A smiling blond woman approached my guest and me and handed us menus. ''Good evening,'' she said with a grin, and without pause, pointed out the nightly specials. ''Have you ever tasted opah?  Ah, but you must, this fish tastes like, well, almost like butter.''</p>

        <p>SO . . . Do you or don't you wish to enter the Land of Chocolate?'' Rei Prabhakar asked as I took a seat at his tiny restaurant here. I watched as he knelt beside his customers, observed his true-believer expression, and wondered where I was headed here at Karen and Rei's. As I looked around, I saw other waiters similarly poised on a knee beside their tables.</p>
        <p>A smiling blond woman approached my guest and me and handed us menus. ''Good evening,'' she said with a grin, and without pause, pointed out the nightly specials. ''Have you ever tasted opah?  Ah, but you must, this fish tastes like, well, almost like butter.''</p>
        <p>She mentioned Karen, Rei's wife and the woman in charge of the kitchen. In fact, our waitress and the rest of the staff spoke reverently and often about Karen, the mad scientist behind what Rei calls their ''melting pot'' food.</p>
        <p>How did I take my waluu? ''Karen recommends that you have that medium to medium-well.''</p>
        <p>I asked for a minute alone to absorb the menu. I had been told that everything was made in-house, from the bread to the ice cream (the bread is made by Rei, a Culinary Institute of America graduate). I noted some fanciful appetizers, soups, salads and pastas and a slew of fish entrees. And over the horizon lay this land of chocolate.</p>
        <p>But I quickly became distracted, overhearing the staff recommending  everything, described in detail, as if each server had been programmed to rattle off exactly what was printed on the menu (even when you are alone with the menu, you get a large of dose of Karen and Rei's dining philosophy), paired with words like ''exquisite'' and ''phenomenal.''</p>
        <p>This fervor certainly diverted attention from the decor. This spot, near the ocean and featuring fish, does not incorporate many nautical motifs, aside from the huge leather chairs on wheels. I imagined myself rolling along with the waves on the floor of a cruise ship lounge, but then there was nary an ocean view or even a salty breeze. In fact, the wall-to-wall carpeting and cramped layout made me question whether I was in a real restaurant or a converted  bungalow.</p>
        <p>When ordering, here's a bit of advice: don't fall for the specials. Although they may sound enticing, they must be a hodgepodge of leftovers from the night before. How else to explain an odd pairing like pickled ginger and strawberries? One dish read like a family shopping list: oven roasted ray with mashed Yukon gold potatoes, toasted garlic, red onion, sun-dried tomatoes, roasted sweet peppers, caper, basil and olive oil, garnished with jumbo lump crabmeat and topped with a grilled portobello mushroom. You want fries with that? Other fish specials also seemed to suffocate under a confusing mountain of accompaniments.</p>
        <p>That said, there are many wonderful items that made up for the unnerving service and the decor. Two soups, unfortunately the consistency of milk rather than cream, were nevertheless loaded with flavor. The mahogany clam chowder was smoky and rich, studded with bacon, potatoes and tender slivers of clam. The miso mushroom soup, centered on a slightly undercooked shrimp won ton, overflowed with oyster mushrooms and miniature cubes of tofu.  An appetizer of steamed clams lay piled in their own aromatic broth infused with garlic and cilantro, flavorful enough to be considered a soup itself.</p>
        <p>The shrimp and crab boudin, although housed in a soggy rather than crisp breading, lay atop a scattering of diced tomato over a sherry cream so pleasantly sweet it could have passed for creme anglaise; were those specks vanilla bean? The flaky, buttery duck and chevre turnovers would seem at home at an elegant cocktail party, although I had to search hard to find the duck amid the dense puffs of cheese.</p>
        <p>Three entrees stood out. The gnocchi -- ''Karen wants to know if you want it spicy on a scale from one to five'' -- were tender, plump and fragrant. But even though I asked for a rating of 2, the chili peppers overpowered the pesto.</p>
        <p>The shrimp de Provence, served over a saffron risotto with spinach, wild mushrooms, walnuts and melted fontina, was refreshingly comforting. Finally, I enjoyed the pan-seared ostrich, sliced, fanned and glazed with an addictive ruby port glaze over baby-food-smooth mound of sweet and Yukon gold potatoes and beets, tender oyster mushrooms, grilled eggplant and caramelized red onion, garnished with lightly fried, super-thin rice paper chips painted with wasabi.</p>
        <p>Desserts are listed in an ''encyclopedia'' of which the Land of Chocolate is a mere subcategory. A typical entry was the chocolate won ton pockets, which dripped molten chocolate all over my fingers (no complaints here). The white Russian chocolate chunk cheesecake was huge, and pleasingly rich, made even better when finished with what the menu said were ''generous amounts of Kahlua.'' Flaming creme brulee provided entertainment. But two treats outshone the rest: the pear and cranberry crisp was flaky and sugary (but probably should have featured in-season peaches or berries), and the ''tea party,'' a medley including pot de creme, biscotti, ice cream and warm miniature cinnamon rolls, would surely have won the heart of the Queen of Hearts.</p>
        <p>As I lingered over the display of treats before me, at last I drifted into the imaginary worlds of ''Alice in Wonderland'' and ''Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.'' Perhaps if Rei and his team hadn't tried so hard to direct me there, I might have arrived earlier.</p>
