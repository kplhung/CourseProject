      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Many readers responded to Peter Applebome's July 23 Soapbox column about racial mores and suburban manners at a gas station in Westchester County. The problem the column posed was what, if anything, to say to or do about the black gentleman sharing his expletive-laden music with the world and also Mr. Applebome's 9-year-old daughter.</p>
        <p>Here is a sampling of readers' reactions.</p>
        <p>If we take the issue of race out of the equation, we will see that a person who drives into a gas station with loud, profane rap music is most probably a rude, aggressive, angry person who is looking for attention.</p>

        <p>I would hope that I would have had the common sense and discretion to have handled the situation exactly as you did. Since I believe that the only race is the human race, the color of the person's skin would not be an issue. The behavior of the person is the issue, and I'm sure his mother wouldn't like it.</p>
