      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>A column July 23 by Peter Applebome described a situation at a gas station in which he and his 9-year-old daughter were exposed to loud rap music with X-rated lyrics booming from the car of a black man wearing a prison guard uniform. He debated asking the man to turn the music down but decided not to. He asked readers what they would do. Here is a sampling of the many responses.</p>
        <p>If one definition of racism is the consideration of race before content of a situation or interaction, then this is racism. The assumption that the driver wouldn't acquiese to a request to turn down the music is driver No. 1's problem. Make no mistake, the daughter is tuning in not just to the rap, but also to her father's discomfort and his choice: Fearful inaction based on race, versus what would probably be a brief and cordial interaction.</p>
