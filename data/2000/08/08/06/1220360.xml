        <p>NO one believed me when I told them about Mabel, not even when I said she wasn't one of those street cows in ''Cow Parade.'' She was an indoor cow and lived with me.</p>
        <p>''Yeah, sure you have a cow in your apartment,'' one friend scoffed.</p>
        <p>''But I do,'' I protested.</p>
        <p>''Mooooooo.''</p>
        <p>I first saw Mabel 10 years ago in the window of a Madison Avenue folk art store. She was a life-size replica of a black and white cow with a pink udder that made you want to reach out and milk her. She had a slight smile and big black eyes with painted eyelashes. I was captivated and went in to look closer. The cow was a one-of-a-kind piece, signed in tiny scrawl on her flank. She looked heavy, but I could pick her up because she was just papier-mache. My then-husband and I had just bought a country house, and he'd left the decorating to me.</p>
        <p>''You bought what?'' he asked that night.</p>
        <p>''A cow. From Mabel's folk art store. We'll put her in the front hallway of the new house. She'll be the first thing people see when they enter. We'll call her Mabel.''</p>
        <p>''Why on earth would you buy a cow?''</p>
        <p>''She makes a statement. She says, this is a country house.''</p>
        <p>''Cows don't live in country houses, they live in country barns.''</p>
        <p>''She's art. She'll appreciate.''</p>
        <p>He rolled his eyes.</p>
        <p>And so Mabel came to Connecticut and won the hearts of our house guests.</p>
        <p>One admirer, returning from Switzerland, bought her a real cowbell. Visiting children delighted in ringing it, especially my stepdaughter's son, Andrew. ''Up, up,'' he'd cry, and I'd hoist him onto Mabel's back while he happily screamed ''Cooooowwwwwwww.''</p>
        <p>Ten years later, having nothing to do with Mabel, my husband and I divorced. We put the house on the market and sold the furniture. But I refused to part with Mabel, and had her shipped to my Manhattan apartment. When the movers unloaded her, Bill, the doorman, looked at her in disbelief. ''What is this, a new kind of milk delivery?''</p>
        <p>Mabel settled into her new pasture on the 33rd floor, squeezed in between the living room window and the couch. Many who entered the apartment sneaked Mabel a little pat when they thought I wasn't looking. The handyman bought her a Santa Claus cap for Christmas. Mabel and I might have lived there together happily ever after. But recently I fell in love with a small, undervalued co-op and grabbed it. As I mentally laid out my furniture, I sadly realized Mabel didn't fit. In small New York apartments, you have to make sacrifices.  Which did I need more: Mabel or my living room furniture? The furniture won.</p>
        <p>I called my stepdaughter Lisa, sure she'd be thrilled to have Mabel permanently, especially now that she had a second child.</p>
        <p>''How would you like to adopt Mabel?'' I asked.</p>
        <p>''Mabel?''</p>
        <p>''The cow.''</p>
        <p>There was silence. Then, ''Where am I going to put it?''</p>
        <p>''You have plenty of room.'' More silence. ''You don't have to take her!'' I didn't want Mabel to go where she wasn't wanted.</p>
        <p>She finally said, ''I guess I could put her downstairs in the basement guest room.''</p>
        <p>The basement? To live in a dusty room used only by visiting in-laws? No, thanks. Mabel needed attention.  She needed to be appreciated and she needed to have her bell rung.</p>
        <p>Why not a nursery school or kindergarten? I called several that loved the idea, but no one had room.  Same problem with day care centers. A friend suggested donating her to the Dairy in Central Park. Constructed to provide city children with milk from sanitary farms, the Dairy is now a visitor's center with hands-on exhibits for children. Perfect! I'd be able to visit on weekends and watch delighted toddlers ring her bell. But shockingly, the Parks Department said no, claiming they planned to make the center completely virtual. I was heartbroken.</p>
        <p>Then an appraiser came up to look at some antiques I wanted to auction before moving. The first thing that caught his eye was Mabel. He pointed and said: ''I'll take the cow. I think I could get a decent price for that.''</p>
        <p>''She's not for sale.'' I wasn't about to put Mabel on the block.</p>
        <p>My move was getting closer and I still didn't know where Mabel was going to live. That night at a cocktail party, I met the Deputy Director of Parks and told him my tale. Couldn't he cut through the red tape and get Mabel accepted at the Dairy? I understood how parents must feel when trying to get their children into private school.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the director was with New York State Parks, not City Parks, but promised to see what he could do.</p>
        <p>He came through. The next day I received a call from the New York Farm Bureau, which runs a program called Agriculture in the Classroom.  They visit grade schools and educate children about agriculture. In the past they've asked farmers to lend real cows for the day, but the logistics have been a nightmare. Perfect.  Mabel would get to tour New York and be surrounded by appreciative children.</p>
        <p>Last month, the Farm Bureau's director of field services picked up Mabel. As he lifted her into the minivan, he promised to give her a good home. I'm going to miss her, but I know it's the right thing. Mabel's going back to the farm.</p>
