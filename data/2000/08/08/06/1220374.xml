        <p>ON the grounds of the Naval Undersea Warfare Center in New London, where scientists invented sonar, stands an exotic artifact that seems as if it lost its way. But 34 years ago, someone did indeed plant a giant sequoia tree at the center. With not a mountain in sight, its usual habitat, the tree thrived and now stands 40 feet tall.</p>
        <p>Connecticut is an odd place to find such a legendary tree, but there are isolated sequoias around the state. There are not enough to qualify as a forest and none big enough to drive through, like some of the giants in California, and they are still curiosities in a state more known for white oaks.</p>
        <p>The conifer, Sequoiadendron giganteum, is related to the California redwood tree. Both are cypress trees with reddish bark and scales on their leaves and can grow hundreds of feet tall. In Connecticut, there is a giant sequoia in Greenwich, another in New London and one in Waterbury. There used to be two in Stonington, but one died last year. East Haven has two, and one is the state champion giant sequoia, standing 65 feet tall. The tallest giant sequoia (at 82 feet) in New England is in Bristol, R.I.</p>
        <p>None of Connecticut's giant sequoias grew here naturally. They were all planted by someone, sometimes in the backyard. Glenn Dreyer, director of the Connecticut College Arboretum, said trees such as sequoias were not meant to spread naturally into the forest in a place like Southern New England because the elevation was much lower and the climate colder than where they thrive in the Sierra Nevada. But Mr. Dreyer said the weather in Southern New England was not too harsh for them. ''There are an awful lot of exotic plants that we bring in that don't take root,'' Mr. Dreyer said. But not so the giant sequoia. The champion sequoia in East Haven, on Laurel Street, almost did not survive, when it ended up in the way of new housing. There, a developer was confronted with the 65-foot-high tree and found a way to keep it where it was. ''I worked around it,'' said Frank Frumento, of New Haven.</p>
        <p>The second sequoia in East Haven was planted in 1967 by former owners of a house on Andrews Court. Susan Giangreco, the current property owner, said the tree continued to grow at the back of her property. It is beneath a silver maple and leans a bit to reach the light, Mr. Dreyer said.</p>
        <p>In Greenwich, about 40 years ago, a nursery worker for the town planted a giant sequoia in the municipal tree nursery. There, among trees cultured for use in town parks, the sequoia grew from 4 feet to nearly 40 feet, its height today, said Robert Wagner, assistant superintendent of parks and trees. It was nothing special at the time, she said. It was ordered in, probably more or less to see if it would survive.</p>
        <p>Greenwich does not grow its own trees anymore. Its sequoia was left to grow near the maintenance building in Bruce Park on Davis Avenue. A split-rail fence protects it. Mr. Wagner said he learned from trips out west that the trees suffered if footsteps compacted the soil around them.</p>
        <p>When Andrew and Amy Hallberg moved into his grandmother's former house on Stanton Lane in Stonington four years ago, they found a giant sequoia and another redwood species, the meta sequoia (also called the dawn sequoia), thriving in the yard. Both trees came from the Brooklyn Botanic Garden about 45 years ago, Dr. Hallberg said.</p>
        <p>Dr. and Mrs. Hallberg like the dawn sequoia with its deciduous needles so much that they planted another one they got at a nursery. In four years it grew from 12 to 24 feet tall, he said. The two older trees, the giant sequoia and the dawn sequoia, are about 70 feet tall.</p>
        <p>A giant sequoia grew to about 20 feet tall before it died last year on River Road in the Pawcatuck section of Stonington, said John Parker, who lives there with his brother, David. The two men believe the tree was a wild seedling when they planted it in 1965, although they were not certain where it originally grew. They got the tree as a gift.</p>
        <p>Margarett Jones, the director of the Denison Pequotsepos Nature Center in Stonington, saw the tree before it died, and noted, ''The conditions are not ideal for it here, so they're not totally happy.''</p>
        <p>Sequoias also grow in private yards in Waterbury and New London, and a meta sequoia is thriving in Wilcox Park in the Pawcatuck section of Stonington.</p>
        <p>New London's giant sequoia still looks more like someone's overgrown Christmas tree, but it could someday live up to its name. It has a thick trunk and healthy branches with just a few spots near the top with brown needles. Weather might have damaged the top, where a new primary shoot is sticking up. It looks a lot better than two diseased black pines next to it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dreyer of the Connecticut College Arboretum visited the tree this spring for the first time. ''I'd never been down to Fort Trumbull,'' he said, adding that he had no idea there was a sequoia only a few miles from the arboretum.</p>
        <p>Staff members of the former warfare center planted their New London sequoia in April 1966. It was one and a half feet tall. The sequoia rode East on an airplane with the lab's former technical director, Harold E. Nash. The donation was the first ornament planted next to a memorial to World War II merchant mariners.</p>
        <p>The center's campus has sat empty since the early 1990's. Today, the land is owned by the New London Development Corporation, which for the last several years has been planning what will be New London's most expansive redevelopment effort in decades.</p>
        <p>The Fort Trumbull neighborhood is being transformed from a little-known section that, besides the sound lab, was best known for a scrap-metal yard and the city's sewage-treatment plant. The centerpiece of the new development will be Pfizer's new research center, a public park and Fort Trumbull State Park, all on the banks of the Thames River.</p>
        <p>The giant sequoia will stand untouched while the corporation builds a hotel on its shore side and a condominium complex to its west, said Damon Hemmerdinger, director of real estate development for the corporation. The war memorial around the tree will also stay, he said.</p>
        <p>''We have been working on how to be sure that both the memorial and the tree are treated appropriately over time,'' Mr. Hemmerdinger said. ''Rest assured that for the last nine months, or longer, we've been very aware that there's a tree there that deserves special attention.''</p>
        <p>Members of New London Landmarks, a preservation organization, have only recently learned about the sequoia and paid a visit to the former sound lab property. They want it to remain a centerpiece of the transformed campus, said Stephen Hallquist, a New London resident who is a member.</p>
        <p>''This is definitely unique,'' Mr. Hallquist said. ''It's not something you find in everybody's neighborhood.''</p>
