        <p>LIKE an alchemist, Rick Lazio turned $15,000 into $36,000. And Hillary Clinton famously performed her own feat of magic on $1,000. Poof! It was $100,000. Both waved away the significance of their fantastic financial feats by calling them beginner's luck. But let's get real. Beginner's luck? Hello! Even your most blessed beginner doesn't have luck like this so, please, don't try to pull the wool over this boy's eyes. We're not talking luck here.</p>

        <p>LIKE an alchemist, Rick Lazio turned $15,000 into $36,000. And Hillary Clinton famously performed her own feat of magic on $1,000. Poof! It was $100,000. Both waved away the significance of their fantastic financial feats by calling them beginner's luck. But let's get real. Beginner's luck? Hello! Even your most blessed beginner doesn't have luck like this so, please, don't try to pull the wool over this boy's eyes. We're not talking luck here.</p>
        <p>We're talking skill.</p>
        <p>Forget Graham and Dodd, Buffet and Lynch and all the Masters of the Universe who doze and drool in your Metro-North car. They are yesterday's news, yellowed business pages. There is truth in numbers and this is Truth No. 1: Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Lazio are the two greatest investment phenoms of our age. It is high time they were publicly annointed the King and Queen of the Age of the Bull Market.</p>
        <p>Can you wait for the first debate between these two politicians-crackerjack traders? It will look like Lincoln-Douglas meets CNBC. But it can't end with a few hot tips during opening remarks. Since these two can mint money as easily as picking low-lying fruit, their talents must be used to pull Democrats and Republicans together.</p>
        <p>As an unprecedented show of bipartianship (Bradley and McCain hooking up for campaign finance reform will look like finger painting in comparison), these two should harness their talents together by opening a stock brokerage firm. Its name, Clinton &amp; Lazio Investments, will keep customers lined up around the block 24/7, even in thunderstorms and tornadoes. Merrill Lynch and Charles Schwab, eat your hearts out. You'll be in receivership faster than you can say, Quick &amp; Reilley.</p>
        <p>The creation of this firm, which will be based in a Chappaqua storefront, has far-reaching implications for Westchester, a land of ever-rising housing prices, property taxes and other expenses. Let's face it, salaries that go a long way elsewhere look runtish here. But invest with Clinton &amp; Lazio and the 600 percent profits you make will be sure to keep the wife in mink.</p>
        <p>Also, if you live anywhere in Westchester, your name is on every ''lead list'' used by every stockbroker who calls you during every dinner time. Hate it? Sure you do, but you wouldn't mind it if it was the first lady on the other line, would you now?</p>
        <p>''Mr. Smith, by the way, can I call you Jim? Please, call me Hillary. Jim, opportunities this good come along so infrequently that in addition to sharing them with my very best clients, Jim, I like to reach out to a few select new clients, Jim. Would 1,000 be good, Jim, or would 2,000 be better?''</p>
        <p>Who could resist a pitch like that? Even I'd stop chewing my minute steak sandwich long enough to sign on. Of course, I wouldn't feel quite as star-crossed if it were Mr. Lazio dialing for dollars, but I'd still invest. I mean, talk about guaranteed profits. The hundreds and hundreds in personal assets that I have accumulated over the years will appreciate to four figures faster than you can say, ''Securities and Exchange investigation.''</p>
        <p>Nationally, too, we're talking a winning scenario. Gov. George W. Bush thinks Social Security should be invested in the stock market? Of course it should . . . by the firm of Clinton &amp; Lazio Investments. Easy street, here comes the whole nation.</p>
        <p>With Clinton &amp; Lazio Investments swapping our retirement stocks, Social Security will be so abloom with surpluses that the average age of retirement will be lowered to 14. What's great about this plan is that neither prospective senator would have to give up politics. Quite the opposite. After all, Harry Truman rose from a small Missouri haberdashery. Why can't Hillary and Rick run from a small Chappaqua boiler room?</p>
        <p>A future presidential campagin video, shot in soft rosy light, will feature one of them waving hello from right beneath the lobby ticker tape. When they promise a ''Bonanza in Every Pot'' in their acceptance speech, there won't be a dry eye in the convention hall. Just then, trade confirmations will fall from the ceiling in lieu of confetti. What a made-for-TV moment.</p>
        <p>Of course, every plan includes the seeds of its own destruction, and one can see what will unfold here. In the past, other politicians, like Al D'Amato and Tom Foley, have received public notice for hitting the stock market's sweet spot, too. This means that shortly after Clinton &amp; Lazio begins operation, their first worthy competitors, the firm of D'Amato &amp; Foley, might hang a shingle across the street and begin to poach clients.</p>
