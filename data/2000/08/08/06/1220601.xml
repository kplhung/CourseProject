      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>A column July 23 by Peter Applebome described a situation at a gas station in which he and his 9-year-old daughter were exposed to loud rap music with X-rated lyrics booming from the car of a black man wearing a prison guard uniform. He debated asking the man to turn the music down but decided not to. He asked readers what they would do. Here is a sampling of the many responses.</p>
        <p>As I stopped at the light in front of Nassau Hall here in Princeton the other day, the beat-up car next to me, with its windows wide open, was literallly vibrating from some incredibly loud rap music. I wondered what the members of the Continental Congress, had they been meeting in Nassau Hall, and could see (and hear) into our future, would have made of this assault on individual freedom. I think I would have sent for my horse and ridden home.</p>
