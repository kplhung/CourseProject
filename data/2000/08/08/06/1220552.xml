        <p>Indian police say aging criminal named Veerappan kidnapped and hid in jungle one of India's most revered movie idols, 72-year-old Rajkumar; photo of Rajkumar (S)</p>

        <p>The line between fantasy and reality is perhaps never as pliable as in the minds of people who love the movie screen, or so it seemed in India last week. There, a real-life mustachioed villain seized a fantasy-life hero and kept millions of people and their officials in suspense about what might happen next.</p>
        <p>The villain of the piece is Veerappan, said by the authorities to be an aging smuggler and elephant poacher who killed his daughter and dozens of policemen. He has nevertheless played Robin Hood to forest dwellers in southern India as he has eluded years of efforts by the authorities to arrest him. But now he wants to be allowed to live a normal life, and stop hiding.</p>

        <p>The line between fantasy and reality is perhaps never as pliable as in the minds of people who love the movie screen, or so it seemed in India last week. There, a real-life mustachioed villain seized a fantasy-life hero and kept millions of people and their officials in suspense about what might happen next.</p>
        <p>The villain of the piece is Veerappan, said by the authorities to be an aging smuggler and elephant poacher who killed his daughter and dozens of policemen. He has nevertheless played Robin Hood to forest dwellers in southern India as he has eluded years of efforts by the authorities to arrest him. But now he wants to be allowed to live a normal life, and stop hiding.</p>
        <p>So last week, the police say, he kidnapped and hid in the jungle one of India's most revered movie idols -- 72-year-old Rajkumar, who millions of Indians have seen on the screen as a Hindu god or a king or a hero in some other garb. The star has made more than 200 films in all.</p>
        <p>Presumably, the plan is for the real criminal to ransom the fantasy hero for some sort of a pardon.</p>
        <p>The public's reaction was equal to the staggering audacity of the crime. On Monday and Tuesday in Bangalore, a city otherwise known mostly for its booming information technology industry, bands of movie fans erupted in street protests bordering on violence and brought the city nearly to a halt.</p>
        <p>And one novelist, U. R. Ananthumurthy, drew the appropriate lesson. Bangalore, he said, ''belongs to the modern world system and thinks it can ignore mass psychology. But it forgets that other reality that lurks within.''</p>
