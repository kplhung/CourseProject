        <p>Eugene Brodsky  Roseline Koener Gallery, 88 Main Street, Westhampton Beach. To Aug. 22. (631) 288-1017.</p>
        <p>We are constantly processing information, and each time things slip, slide and become reconfigured, even subtly. It is this quality of contemporary sensibility that Mr. Brodsky, a mid-career New York City-based artist, manages to harness in this astute, creative body of mixed-media paintings and works on paper.</p>
        <p>Using common images recycled from the vast pool of what circulates, Mr. Brodsky irregularly outlines figures or objects in a manner that skips, eliminates and blurs definitions, much like video material blown up to where a form begins to disintegrate and fall apart. His paintings rest just at the edge of legibility.</p>
        <p>Most images appear in a variation of a rectangular format, with groupings of these geometrics combined to make a single work. The concept suggests multiple computer program windows functioning at the same time. In several of the larger examples, rectangles are projecting relief constructions. They seem to imply that we no longer think in terms of perspective, but in layers.  There is a questioning of traditional ideas about plane and surface.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brodsky seems to be saving the process of altering information and commenting on the notion of process itself. Each of the five boxlike shapes in ''Blue Window'' includes a rough numerical marking, referring to customary methods of handling an assembly project.</p>
        <p>''Looking in the Mirror, No. 9'' is one of the most compelling mixed-media works on paper. Its assertive black linear markings, all echoed with gray shadows, form a nonrecognizable configuration that looks like a cross between a doodle and a section of high-technology wiring gone astray.</p>
        <p>Where images are identifiable, the subjects are often disarmingly simple: a cartoon mouse, a stooped figure, an automobile fragment or a corner of a room. Content is random, yet there is geometric construction and in the case of the ''Story Board'' series, a sense of sequence. It is fascinating to note how Mr. Brodsky has blended the mental and physical in an effective, original approach.</p>
        <p>Outdoor Sculpture, 2000  LongHouse Reserve, 133 Hands Creek Road, East Hampton. To Sept. 9. (631) 329-3568.</p>
        <p>This handsomely developed 16-acre site has an outdoor sculpture program based on both short and long-term installations. Among the pieces currently on view, works by Magdalena Abakanowicz, Dale Chihuly and the Swedish sculptors Ulla and Gustav Kraitz are presented for just this season.</p>
        <p>With 450 glass sculptures organized into eight installations, Mr. Chihuly's project is easily the most ambitious. It is also the most varied in scale, content and complexity. Some groupings are inserted into the landscape but retain their integrity as glass; some are displayed against carefully chosen environmental backdrops, and some, like ''Forest Pods,'' incorporate nature directly into their scheme.</p>
        <p>In this particularly effective example, dozens of fragile, curving pod shapes, all in red tones, are densely piled around a sturdy tree trunk. The interior shadings and shadows created by the stacking of the translucent pieces emphasize the sensuousness of colored glass but also introduce an uneasy sense of weight. Other Chihuly configurations work primarily with motifs that conjure the organic qualities of animated creatures or the changeable characteristics of leaves or reeds. Much of their success comes from the way they blend abstraction and representation.</p>
        <p>Headless figures are one of the best known motifs associated with Ms. Abakanowicz's distinguished career. Her two robotlike examples here are placed on diving board-shaped projections jutting out over a large water-lily pond. They have extended arms and appear to be seeking some metaphysical relationship with the water. The specific pose and situation reduce the ambiguity that has always fueled the psychological energy and sense of angst in the Abakanowicz personages.</p>
        <p>Highly reflective glazes contribute to the way the Kraitz ceramic sculptures contrast with the surrounding greenery. Several examples are designed to collect and hold water, which further augments the deliberate use of reflections. The most memorable works, however, use multiples of the same form, either in dramatic sequences or in piles, or in the case of three cone-shaped vessels, in a kind of intense dialogue.</p>
        <p>Elliott Erwitt  Axinn Library, Hofstra Museum, Hempstead. To Aug. 18. (516) 463-5672.</p>
        <p>Much of Mr. Erwitt's international reputation is based on the way his camera records idiosyncratic twists to familiar things. There is often something mischievous in the subject or viewing angle and observers are never quite sure whether guilt rests with themselves or with the artist.</p>
        <p>This sampling from the museum's collection is valuable for its overview of the wry humor in a range of subjects spanning five decades. The artist's popular dog theme is represented, along with unexpected sightings noted at beaches, parks and streets all over the globe. Represented, too, is the teasingly cerebral museum-watching series, currently the subject of an Erwitt show at the Edwynn Hauk Gallery in New York City.</p>
        <p>Occasionally Mr. Erwitt's unlikely juxtapositions present an odd dialogue, and often a pun. ''Las Vegas,'' for example, depicts an elderly woman grasping the gun held by a dummy cowboy, and ''Amagansett, New York'' creates drama where none exists by showing an American flag planted next to a sunbather almost totally buried in the sand.</p>
        <p>Strong, sensitive compositions are an important component in Mr. Erwitt's presentation of ironic relationships. In ''Florida,'' for example, scale and positioning underscore the strange parallel between a curved water pipe and the graceful neck of a bird. Many sightings are not at all profound -- they are experiences that could happen to anyone -- but they are unquestionably worth remembering.</p>
