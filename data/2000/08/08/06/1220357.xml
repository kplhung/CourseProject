        <p>OCEAN AVENUE, on a Saturday night in late July: the opera at Convention Hall has just let out and hundreds of mostly gray-haired men and women scurry to their Volvos and BMW's to drive back to the suburbs.</p>
        <p>In the squat white building across the street, women with short hair and tattoos enter the side door of Atlantis, the city's lesbian dance club.</p>
        <p>On the next corner, a small line of latter-day hippies is forming outside the Stone Pony, the recently reopened rock club where Bruce Springsteen and Bon Jovi got their start.</p>
        <p>But the real action is at the end of the street, where tanned and for the most part well-sculpted men -- and women -- stream past the neon-lighted waterfall and into Club Paradise.</p>
        <p>Since opening last summer, Club Paradise, situated in the old Empress Hotel, has drawn a growing number of gays and lesbians looking for a New York kind of experience at a Jersey Shore club. On this Saturday night, 900 people have come from Philadelphia, New York City as well as all over New Jersey to be part of the scene.</p>
        <p>The club is the brainchild of Shep Pettibone, whose former songwriting and studio production work make him a bit of legend here. When he isn't in the D.J. booth spinning discs, the boyish-looking 41-year-old owner is racing around the club making sure everyone is having a good time.</p>
        <p>Born in nearby Ocean Grove, Mr. Pettibone got started in the music business spinning discs at CJ's record store here in the 1970's. He then spent several years in New York, writing and remixing songs for such rock icons as Madonna and George Michael. Tired of his life as a ''studio rat,'' Mr. Pettibone was trying to open a club in Manhattan when he stumbled on the Empress in January 1999, which at the time was closed down and boarded up. Rather than being put off by the broken glass, ancient plumbing and homeless people who had taken up residence there, he saw an opportunity.</p>
        <p>''I knew that if people wanted to go to a good, happening club, they'd go anywhere,'' he said. ''You light it up, you have security, and you do it right, and they'll come. This is like hosting a party every week and getting to know a lot of new people all the time.''</p>
        <p>The 7,000-square-foot club is divided into three areas, a front bar and piano lounge, a sprawling black and neon disco space, and a quieter back bar that tends to attract the lesbian population. On summer weekends, the courtyard pool draws hundreds of gays in tank suits and lesbians in bikinis who sit around the patio sipping pina coladas and going for a swim. With the club attracting business on weekends in winter as well as during the summer season, Mr. Pettibone said he would eventually like to open the upper floors of the 1959 hotel but would ''wait until the town gets its act together before making that kind of a major investment.''</p>
        <p>Several of the gays and lesbians who have bought homes in Asbury Park in the last year say Club Paradise is a major draw to the area. In addition to Paradise, there are three other gay nightspots for those who are into bar-hopping.</p>
        <p>At one end of the spectrum is Zippers on Kingsley Street, where well-endowed (or artificially subsidized) bartenders serve drinks in G-strings and allow patrons to get up close and personal for a few extra dollars. At the other end of the scope is Georgie's, next to the railroad tracks on Fifth Street, which, with its pool table and pinball machines, looks like any other neighborhood tavern, but draws a crowd that is primarily gay, one patron said. And  there is Atlantis, a cavernous club with vast dance floors that is favored by lesbians.</p>
        <p>As the club scene winds down, the crowd moves along to the Talking Bird, a diner serving greasy bacon and eggs and open only on weekends from midnight to 4 a.m.</p>
