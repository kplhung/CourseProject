        <p>ROCK may have been born as American music, but at middle age it is also the music of the Americas, as quickly becomes apparent during an afternoon spent in a recording studio here with Aterciopelados, Colombia's most popular rock band. The duo is rushing to finish mixing tracks for its new compact disc before heading off for a summer tour of the United States.</p>
        <p>Andrea Echeverri and Hector Buitrago, the group's founders, are putting the finishing touches on a song called ''El Album,'' which has just the sort of mixed-salad of a sound that has made the band so successful throughout Latin America. The tune features a twangy rockabilly guitar, a repetitive piano pattern that would sound at home on any salsa record, the scratching of a hip-hop D.J., and a chorus in the accordion-driven Colombian folk style known as vallenato.</p>
        <p>''We are rockers at heart, but we are Latin American rockers, and that means that our music feeds on a lot of different sources,'' Ms. Echeverri, who sings and writes for Aterciopelados (pronounced ah-TARE-see-oh-pay-LAH-dos), whose name means ''the Velvets,'' said after the session was over. ''We like to mix things from outside with what is indigenous because that is what makes the music so cool and unpredictable.''</p>
        <p>In studios and on stages all over Latin America these days, similar scenes are unfolding as a new generation of musicians, raised on rock in all its various permutations, topples the traditional stereotypes of what Latin music ought to be. If only for lack of a better name, the movement, which has been developing since the mid 1980's, has come to be known as rock en espanol -- and to be seen by its adherents as a powerful and energizing global force.</p>
        <p>''Rock 'n' roll was born out of a cultural clash in the United States between black and white,'' said Gustavo Santaolalla, an Argentine who is the leading producer of rock en espanol records. ''Now a new cultural clash is taking place worldwide between American culture and our indigenous cultures and the result, at a time when so much mainstream pop music sounds like it has been rehashed or recycled, is something that is new and fresh and exciting.''</p>
        <p>The term rock en espanol is all-purpose and all-inclusive, grouping musicians whose only real points in common are that they grew up admiring Anglo-American rock bands and that they sing in Spanish. Indeed, the movement is so wide-ranging that it comfortably embraces everything from Mexican rappers like Molotov, Control Machete and El Gran Silencio to melodic singer-songwriters like the Argentines Fito Paez, Charly Garcia and Andres Calamaro.</p>
        <p>But as record companies have discovered in recent years, rock en espanol is a phenomenon that is as much commercial as aesthetic, which has created an interesting quandary for many Latin American rockers about their future directions as their music moves beyond their borders. Bands like the Mexican power-pop quartet Mana, to take the most prominent example, routinely fill soccer and baseball stadiums, arenas and bull rings with audiences of 25,000 or more and sell millions of records to Spanish-speaking teenagers all over Latin America and, increasingly, the United States.</p>
        <p>The movement has been slower to make an impact in New York, whose Spanish-speaking population is predominantly Caribbean and thus more accustomed to tropical rhythms, than in Latin America or in cities like Los Angeles, Miami and Chicago. But over the next three weeks that situation may change, as a result of the Latin Alternative Music Conference, a three-day industry forum scheduled to begin next Sunday, and a series of showcase concerts sandwiched around it.</p>
        <p>On Saturday, the Chilean pop quartet La Ley, the dance specialists Los Amigos Invisibles from Venezuela and the Argentine funk band Ilya Kuryaki and the Valderramas will be performing in a free open-air concert at Central Park Summerstage. Then on Aug. 23 the Watcha Tour, a package show that has become Latin rock's equivalent of Lollapalooza, arrives in New York for the first time, with Cafe Tacuba, Aterciopelados, Molotov and Animal playing at the Tunnel.</p>
        <p>What is most striking about these and other popular rock en espanol bands is their eclecticism and flexibility. Like Latin American musicians from earlier generations, they have grown up listening to the whole gamut of styles that make up the region's common musical heritage: salsa, tango, merengue, bolero, cumbia, mariachi, samba, ranchera, mambo and so on.</p>
        <p>But thanks to improved communications and economic conditions, they have also had more opportunities than their predecessors to become familiar and comfortable with the popular music of the English-speaking world. From Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and Bob Dylan to Nirvana, Oasis and Nine Inch Nails, they have heard -- and absorbed -- it all.</p>
        <p>''We are amphibious,'' said Ivan Benavides, leader of the Colombian group Bloque, whose eponymous debut album made the top 10 lists of several New York Times critics in 1998. ''We can play the music of the cultures we were born into, but it also feels natural to play the music of the broader cosmopolitan culture. That gives us an advantage over people who are ethnocentric, whether they are Anglo-, Euro- or Latino-centric.''</p>
        <p>At the time that Latin rockers, most of whom are in their 30's, were growing up, cultural discourse in Latin America was dominated by doctrinaire leftists who argued that rock was a decadent manifestation of American imperialism and that only folk-based indigenous music could be a valid form of expression. Given what they saw as a false dichotomy between Silvio Rodriguez and David Bowie, or Victor Jara and Kiss, the rockers quite deliberately chose both.</p>
        <p>''People on the left tend to have very closed opinions and not to be very farsighted,'' said Flavio Cianciarulo, the bass player and a songwriter for Los Fabulosos Cadillacs, Argentina's most innovative band. ''Rock is essentially pure rebellion, and always has been, but they couldn't understand that, so we just wrote them off and continued to do our own thing, always with honesty.''</p>
        <p>In their early days, admittedly, many rock en espanol performers sounded like copies of whatever Anglo-American bands first inspired them to pick up their instruments or sing. Mana drew heavily on the Police, La Ley emerged as a cross between Depeche Mode and Duran Duran, Los Fabulosos Cadillacs seemed like an Argentine version of the Specials and the Colombian singer-songwriter Shakira found herself being compared to Alanis Morissette.</p>
        <p>But as bands and singers have gradually gained experience and confidence, that tendency has changed, and Latin American rock today can be just as adventurous and stylistically promiscuous as North American pop. One of the biggest hits in Latin America during the past year, for example, has been Shakira's ''Ojos Asi,'' which fuses a Spanish-language lyric with a Middle Eastern melody and rhythms.</p>
        <p>''I grew up in Barranquilla, which is a Caribbean port city where you heard every kind of music you could imagine, from cumbia and vallenato to rhythm-and-blues,'' recalled Shakira, a member of a Lebanese immigrant family whose full name is Shakira Mebarak. ''Some of the first records I remember hearing as a little girl were Donna Summer and the Arab singers that my parents liked,'' such as the Egyptian singer Oum Kalsoum.</p>
        <p>But if one place has been most influential in the development of the movement, it is Mexico. Even in the 1960's, Mexican bands were listening to the ''border blasters,'' high-wattage radio stations broadcasting to the United States from Mexican territory and recording Spanish-language cover versions of American rock 'n' roll hits. By the mid 1980's, Mexican record labels were slowly waking to the commercial possibilities of home-grown rock.</p>
        <p>''Rock en tu idioma,'' or ''rock in your language,'' was the way they marketed the new sound. Based in Mexico City, bands like Cafe Tacuba, Maldita Vecindad, Caifanes, Santa Sabina and La Castaneda found small clubs in bohemian neighborhoods that were willing to let them play, developed followings that soon grew from the local to the national, and signed contracts with the Mexican branches of the main multinational record companies.</p>
        <p>''It was important as an affirmation to sing in Spanish,'' said Ruben Albarran of Cafe Tacuba, the pioneering band whose recent activities have included a tour of the United States with Beck and recordings with the Kronos Quartet. ''We had to define ourselves.''</p>
        <p>At the other end of the continent, in Argentina, a similar process was under way. A flourishing rock 'n' roll scene had emerged in Buenos Aires during the 1960's, but when a right-wing military junta seized power in the mid 1970's, the music was forced to retreat and only began to re-emerge after the collapse of the dictatorship following the Falklands War of 1982.</p>
        <p>''It is no accident that we began around 1984,'' Mr. Cianciarulo said. Once civilian rule was restored, he said, ''everything that had gone underground came out into the light of day, and freedom became the order of the day.''</p>
        <p>Though isolated from the rest of Latin America by language, Brazil saw its pop music evolve along the same lines. The tropicalists who first came to prominence in the late 1960's continue to flourish there, but groups like Paralamas do Suceso, Legiao Urbana, Titas, Skank, Charlie Brown Jr., Jota Quest, Barao Vermelho, Kid Abelha, Planet Hemp and Chico Science have forged an equally catholic, Portuguese-language variant of Latin rock.</p>
        <p>Yet each nation's burgeoning rock scene might have continued in insularity were it not for recent advances in technology and more contacts between the local affiliates of multinational record companies. Perhaps the biggest factor in breaking down barriers, artists and managers agree, has been the explosive growth of cable television in Latin America during the last five years.</p>
        <p>''MTV Latino and CNN en Espanol have been fundamental'' in spreading rock en espanol, said Beto Cuevas, lead singer of the Chilean band La Ley, whose base is in Mexico. ''They not only showed us what was happening in the United States at the same time it was happening, but also allowed us to see what was going on in Argentina or Colombia, countries that had their own rock tradition but hadn't been heard elsewhere because of a lack of communication.''</p>
        <p>But now, because of its very success, the movement, rebaptized Latin Alternative to make it more palatable to North American audiences, may be approaching a crossroads. Stimulated by the recent crossover success of home-grown Hispanic performers like Ricky Martin and Jennifer Lopez, interest in Latin American rock is growing in the United States, both among audiences hungry for new sounds and record companies eager for new profits.</p>
        <p>THERE is now a Grammy award for best Latin Rock/Alternative performance, for instance, and several Latin rock songs have turned up in Hollywood films seeking an edgy tone, ''Grosse Pointe Blank'' and various Quentin Tarantino movies among them. College radio stations are adding rock en espanol to their playlists, Web sites and publications like Spin have begun to pay attention to the genre, and booking agencies like Creative Artists Agency have signed leading rock en espanol bands and sent them out on tour with established American pop artists.</p>
        <p>''I know that I don't get calls from EMI Latino or Sony Discos anymore,'' said Tomas Cookman, manager of Los Fabulosos Cadillacs, Aterciopelados and other top groups, referring to the traditional Latin music departments of two big labels. ''Now I'm more likely to be dealing with Maverick Records or Atlantic or Warners or Chris Blackwell. This is a wonderful moment, like the beginning of hip-hop, when Russell Simmons was just getting Def Jam together.''</p>
        <p>As a result, however, many of Latin America's most popular rock bands are facing a dilemma. Do they continue to focus on their loyal Spanish-speaking audience back home or do they shift more of their attention and energy to a potentially futile quest to break into the promising but unknown American market, at the risk of sacrificing what makes them authentic and perhaps alienating their original fans?</p>
        <p>A hilariously sly new video by Los Fabulosos Cadillacs that has been in heavy rotation on MTV Latino in recent weeks makes it clear that at least one band recognizes the problem. The clip accompanying ''La Vida'' features an American image consultant, unable to speak Spanish and completely unattuned to the band's proudly grungy image and sound, trying to repackage them into a slick, dancing ensemble, a la 'N Sync or Ricky Martin.</p>
        <p>Some artists, like Shakira, are convinced they can have it both ways. She recently signed a contract with the same management team that long guided Madonna's career and has spent much of the summer in the Bahamas, working on new material and translating some of her older songs for a projected English-language album.</p>
        <p>''I want the chance to expand as an artist, and I'm curious,'' she said. ''I want to know what's on the other side, how far I can take this thing. It's a challenge to sing in another language, but it's also an opportunity, and if I can have success in both languages, of course that will also bring credit to Colombia.''</p>
        <p>Julieta Venegas, in contrast, is a 29-year-old Mexican singer-songwriter who grew up in Tijuana, listening to California radio stations ''with more a chance of seeing Iggy Pop or Oingo Boingo in San Diego'' than hearing rock in Spanish. Though she speaks perfect English, the only suggestion of an accent being that of a Valley Girl, and recorded her latest disc in Los Angeles with American studio musicians, she insisted ''it never occurred to me to write in English.''</p>
        <p>''I like having access to American music, but writing in Spanish is a big part of what I am and what makes my music interesting, even to someone who might not understand the language,'' she said. ''We've been watching you people all the time, and now you're watching us. It's sort of funny, but it's true, and I think that's the way it's going to stay from now on, with everybody on both sides of the border exposed to a broader, richer range of influences.''</p>
        <p>To Try a New Sound</p>
        <p>If the idea of Latin American rock and pop seems utterly foreign, here are a dozen records, chosen to display the diversity of the movement, that offer a good starting point for the beginner:</p>
        <p>ATERCIOPELADOS -- ''Caribe Atomico'' (BMG 1998). Tropical punk? Psychedelic folk? It is hard to classify this eclectic collection from Colombia other than to say it never stops swinging, surprising or satisfying.</p>
        <p>BLOQUE -- ''Bloque de Busqueda'' (Luaka Bop 1998). The group started as the back-up band for the vallenato star Carlos Vives, then made this record showing the darker side of Colombian pop, with acerbic lyrics and harsh heavy metal guitars over a driving Afro-Caribbean percussion section.</p>
        <p>LOS FABULOSOS CADILLACS -- ''Vasos Vacios'' (Sony 1994). This Argentine ensemble has shown jazz leanings on its most recent records, but this early best-of compilation highlights its reggae-ska-dub-punk origins and includes the Brazilian-influenced ''Matador,'' still its signature song.</p>
        <p>CAIFANES -- ''La Historia'' (BMG/Ariola 1997). A two-disc set that traces the evolution of one of Mexico's most important groups from a clone of the Cure to a tight and deft ensemble proud of its Latin American origins.</p>
        <p>CHARLY GARCIA -- ''Obras Cumbres'' (Sony 2000). A two-volume career retrospective from Latin America's foremost singer-songwriter, a disciple of Bob Dylan and the Beatles who has inspired a generation of younger artists. It includes ''No Voy en Tren,'' perhaps the first rock en espanol anthem.</p>
        <p>LOS AMIGOS INVISIBLES -- ''The New Sound of the Venezuelan Gozadera'' (Luaka Bop 1998). Dance music as self-referentially playful and goofy as anything the B-52's have ever recorded.</p>
        <p>JAGUARES -- ''El Equilibrio de los Jaguares'' (BMG 1996). If rock en espanol has a guitar virtuoso, Mexico's Saul Hernandez is the man, and this brooding but beautiful collection of songs allows him to show off all his chops.</p>
        <p>MANA -- ''Suenos Liquidos'' (WEA Latina 1997). The best-selling rock en espanol record ever, by a Guadalajara-based quartet that has parlayed a melodic, power-pop sound into unparalleled commercial success.</p>
        <p>MOLOTOV -- ''Donde Jugaran Las Ninas?'' (Surco/Universal 1998). Bilingual rap from a binational quartet (three Mexicans and one gringo) that is by turns angry, scatological and humorous.</p>
        <p>SHAKIRA -- ''Donde Estan Los Ladrones?'' (Sony 1998). At 23, this Colombian singer and songwriter has barely entered adulthood but already shows a striking talent for the polished, well-made pop tune, the most appealing of which here is probably the Arab-influenced ''Ojos Asi.''</p>
        <p>CAFE TACUBA -- ''Reves/Yo Soy'' (WEA Latina 1999). A challenging two-disc collection (one of quirky instrumentals, the other of more conventional but stylistically diverse songs) that may be the crowning achievement of Mexico's most consistently adventurous and experimental rock band.</p>
        <p>VARIOUS ARTISTS -- ''Reconquista! The Latin Rock Invasion'' (Rhino 1996). A chronicle of rock en espanol's early, punk-inspired years, with an emphasis on the Mexican pioneers of the movement but also including a pair of key cuts by Los Fabulosos Cadillacs.</p>
