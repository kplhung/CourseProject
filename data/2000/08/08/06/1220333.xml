        <p>GERMAINE ACOGNY was sitting in a Viennese cafe four summers ago, smoking her pipe, when a blond woman with a broad, animated face sauntered in. Ms. Acogny recognized her as Susanne Linke, the gutsy German dancer she had once seen on television performing an anguished duet with a claw-foot bathtub.</p>
        <p>Ms. Acogny took the liberty of introducing herself, for she, too, was a dancer of some renown. Maurice Bejart, calling her ''my African double,'' had enlisted her in 1977 to open a branch of his modernist dance school in Senegal, the former French colony where she grew up.</p>
        <p>Known as Mudra Afrique, the school ran out of money within five years, but Ms. Acogny was ready to try again. After more than a dozen years in France, she had decided to start a new school for traditional and contemporary African dance in Senegal. Perhaps Ms. Linke, she suggested, would like to come teach a workshop.</p>
        <p>Their chance encounter ultimately gave rise to ''Le Coq Est Mort,'' an earnest but problematic production that will open on Wednesday at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in Becket, Mass. Choreographed by Ms. Linke, the 70-minute piece centers on eight African men who cast off the trappings of Western culture and renew their connection with nature.</p>
        <p>Some spectators questioned Ms. Linke's artistic vision when Compagnie Jant-Bi, the fledgling troupe affiliated with Ms. Acogny's school of the same name, performed it last year in Senegal, France, Germany, Italy and Canada. The flash point was a scene in which the dancers, who are black, cavort like apes. Ms. Linke, who is white, has maintained that the scene is being crudely misread.</p>
        <p>Either way, ''Le Coq Est Mort'' sheds light on some of the tensions inherent in working with people from other cultures, a practice that is gaining favor among performing artists. At the Lincoln Center Festival, for example, the French choreographer Mathilde Monnier recently presented ''Pour Antigone,'' her 1991-93 collaboration with dancers and a drummer from Burkina Faso and Mali. In October the Brooklyn Academy of Music will stage ''Tree,'' Ralph Lemon's joint venture with artists from India, China, Taiwan, Japan, Ivory Coast and the United States.</p>
        <p>Ms. Acogny and Ms. Linke, both 56, saw their partnership as an opportunity to forge a new alloy of West African physicality and European expressionism. In a recent telephone interview from Germany, Ms. Linke traced her affinity for dance -- and expressionist movement in particular -- to her childhood. As an infant she had meningitis, and it kept her from speaking until she was 6. Out of necessity, she learned to communicate with hand gestures. ''That had a great influence on my life,'' she said. ''Even now, body language is closer to me, more natural to me, than speaking with words. I prefer to move.''</p>
        <p>To develop her talent, she sought out some of the most inventive figures in German dance -- from Mary Wigman, the pioneering expressionist, to Hans Zullig, a successor to Kurt Jooss at the Folkwang School, an influential dance academy in Essen. She also danced briefly for Pina Bausch, who attended the school a decade ahead of her.</p>
        <p>Although Ms. Linke directed the Folkwang Dance Studio for 10 years, and the Bremen Theater for another 6, she is best known for her solos. Typically, they are stark portraits of women in distress, but instead of passing off tired archetypes she achieves a psychological depth that is eerily persuasive.</p>
        <p>Ms. Acogny abides by a more earthy aesthetic. Speaking on the phone from France, she likened her dancing to ''a big tree, with deep roots and branches that reach to the sky.'' (She offers the same metaphor in ''Danse Africaine,'' a book on technique that she published in Germany and Senegal in 1980.) ''I'm trying to make a connection between tradition and modernity,'' she said. ''I take pride in my personal heritage, but still I want to go in a contemporary direction.''</p>
        <p>HER first break came, oddly enough, when she was asked to help ''Africanize'' a platoon of drum majorettes in Dakar, the Senegalese capital. Her fusion of stately marching and polyrhythmic stamping caught the eye of Leopold Senghor, Senegal's first president. A poet as well, Mr. Senghor became famous before independence for expressing Africa's social and political mood in lyrical French, spawning the literary movement known as Negritude.</p>
        <p>It was Mr. Senghor who introduced her to Mr. Bejart and marshaled the funds for Mudra Afrique. Like Mudra (a Sanskrit term for gesture), Mr. Bejart's school in Brussels, it took a cosmopolitan approach, with classes in ballet, modern dance, traditional African dance, drumming and singing.</p>
        <p>Money was always tight, but after Mr. Senghor left office the school was hard pressed to continue. Ms. Acogny soon moved to France, opening a school for Euro-African dance outside Toulouse and creating solos for herself. Her signature piece, ''Ye'ou, the Awakening,'' won a Time Out London Dance and Performance Award in 1991.</p>
        <p>Returning to Senegal a few years later, she bought some land in Toubab Dialaw, a fishing village 30 miles south of Dakar. When Ms. Linke arrived there in 1998 for the inaugural session of the new school, she found 28 dancers -- most of them Senegalese men -- but no studio. The dancers stayed with local families and shared meals prepared by some of the village women. Classes were held on the beach or under a large baobab tree.</p>
        <p>''It's like a pioneer project,'' said Helmut Vogt, a German entrepreneur who met -- and then married -- Ms. Acogny after reading her book 18 years ago. ''When we bought this land there was no water, no electricity. There was only sand and stone.''</p>
        <p>Inspired by ''the energy and power'' of the dancers, Ms. Linke returned last year to create a new work. With Ms. Acogny, she assembled a troupe of eight male students -- six from Senegal, one from Nigeria and one from the Congo Republic. The new company took its name from the school; Jant-Bi means sun in Wolof, the Senegalese dancers' native tongue.</p>
        <p>''When I make a dance, I always have a strong concept and meaning in mind when I start,'' said Ms. Linke, who had never been to Africa before she met Ms. Acogny. ''But this time I went without any idea. Only the energy was important to me.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Linke and her assistant, an Israeli choreographer named Avi Kaiser, spent the first few weeks guiding the dancers in a series of improvisations. For example, they experimented with leaping and falling to get around the difficulty of turning in the sand. (Sand became so integral to the dance that Jacob's Pillow will truck in nearly 10 tons of it this week to blanket the stage of the Ted Shawn Theater.)</p>
        <p>As themes of power, competition and war began to emerge, Ms. Linke fashioned a narrative about a community that rediscovers its cultural identity. The title, she said, expresses a desire to be free of French domination, male swagger and the roosters that woke the dancers each morning in Toubab Dialaw. (''We wanted to kill them,'' she said.)</p>
        <p>The dance begins with eight men, dressed as diplomats or businessmen, who traverse the sand in complex patterns, stopping occasionally to shake hands or exchange briefcases. Eventually they grow frustrated and, as the shrill sound of Shostakovich gives way to spirited drumming, their stiff formal abstractions take on spry, demonstrative quality.</p>
        <p>Shirtless, the men later scamper about like gorillas, with tight shoulders, bent wrists and a bounding gait. Their reverie is shattered by the sound of gunfire, and most of them fall to they ground. Returning to human form, they rise and sing an anthem associated with traditional Senegalese wrestling matches. Ms. Linke said she used it as an exhortation to resist the homogenizing forces of modern society.</p>
        <p>At first the monkey scene troubled Ms. Acogny, who feared that audiences might take it the wrong way, and she suggested that Ms. Linke cut it. But when they consulted the troupe, the dancers insisted on keeping the sequence, which they liked for its technical challenges and intrinsic beauty.</p>
        <p>Villagers in Toubab Dialaw voiced no complaints, Ms. Acogny said, when ''Le Coq Est Mort'' had its premiere last year in the school's new outdoor performance space. She said the only criticism came from ''black and white intellectuals'' who view the dance through the lens of colonialism.</p>
        <p>The underlying question is whether any motive can justify a white choreographer's decision to have black dancers mimic animals. Can an artist reasonably expect the audience to view such images without recalling the painful narrative of slavery, colonialism and racism?</p>
        <p>''It's not my opinion that blacks are closer to monkeys than whites,'' said Ms. Linke, who will join Ms. Acogny in a public dialogue -- part of the free Pillow Talk series -- between the matinee and evening performances on Saturday at Jacob's Pillow. ''To me, it's a symbol of an ancestor that we all share.''</p>
        <p>To some critics, though, it doesn't matter whether the dancers move like apes or angels; as long as a white person is calling the shots, some exploitation is inevitable. Indeed, many artists who have forged international creative partnerships have found the dynamics of power far more daunting than language barriers, the logistics of overseas travel or aesthetic differences.</p>
        <p>''What I found most difficult were the ethical considerations,'' Ms. Monnier said shortly before ''Pour Antigone'' opened at Lincoln Center. She spent nine years of her childhood in Morocco, where her father was in the textile business, and the failings of French colonialism led to countless conversations at the family dinner table. ''It was important to me to come back to those questions in my art and try to see what happened,'' she said. ''Are we falling into the same relationship? Are we going to make the same mistakes? Or are we going to find another way?''</p>
        <p>Ms. Linke, citing Germany's shorter tenure as a colonial power in Africa, said she was less troubled by those concerns. Even so, Ms. Acogny attested to Ms. Linke's equitable relationship with the troupe.</p>
        <p>''Susanne never imposed things on the dancers,'' she said. ''She always spoke with them first. And the dancers gave the improvisations, they gave the movement phrases, and they created the work together.''</p>
