        <p>Four months ago in Texas, Gov. George W. Bush signed a proclamation declaring June 10 to be Jesus Day, and urging all Texans to ''follow Christ's example by performing good works in their communities and neighborhoods.''</p>
        <p>The proclamation received little attention, except for some gratitude from a Christian group that had asked many governors to issue proclamations supporting its annual day of charity, prayer and parades in Jesus' name.</p>
        <p>Now what seemed purely ceremonial has turned into a controversy for Governor Bush. As word of Texas' Jesus Day has spread, the Republican presidential nominee has come under criticism for insensitivity to people of non-Christian faiths and a disregard for the First Amendment.</p>
        <p>''The assumption is that Christianity is the norm for America,'' said Phil Baum, executive director of the American Jewish Congress, ''and that Jews and other minorities are here essentially as guests at the sufferance of our hosts, in a secondary position, which is an uncomfortable situation to be in.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Baum called the proclamation ''an egregious and blatant violation of the spirit of the First Amendment.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, who has put his Christian faith front and center in the campaign, has tried to project an image of inclusiveness to people of all ethnicities and religions. In the past, he has been put on the defensive for saying that the only way to heaven was through Christ, and for naming Jesus as his favorite political philosopher.</p>
        <p>Now the governor's office has been receiving letters and e-mail messages from people outraged by the  proclamation, or asking if it is true, said Linda Edwards, a spokeswoman for Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>''George Bush is sensitive to those concerns,'' Ms. Edwards said, ''but is also mindful of the longstanding tradition of governors in both parties to honor individuals and organizations for their good works through greetings and proclamations.'' Governor Bush has also signed proclamations supporting Bahai centenary day, Holocaust Remembrance Day, and a Hanukkah celebration, in Austin, she said.</p>
        <p>The proclamation, which Ms. Edwards said was written by the governor's staff, begins: ''Throughout the world, people of all religions recognize Jesus Christ as an example of love, compassion, sacrifice and service. Reaching out to the poor, the suffering and the marginalized, he provided moral leadership that continues to inspire countless men, women and children today.</p>
        <p>''To honor his life and teachings, Christians of all races and denominations have joined together to designate June 10 as Jesus Day,'' it reads. ''Jesus Day challenges people to follow Christ's example by performing good works in their communities and neighborhoods.''</p>
        <p>The proclamation was sought by the ''March for Jesus,'' an Atlanta  group that organizes marches and  assistance for the poor in about 500 cities on the same day each year.</p>
        <p>Tom Pelton, founder and organizer of the March for Jesus, said in an interview: ''To me it would be a stretch to see that proclamation as being demeaning toward other religions. It's meant to point out that the things that Jesus taught are consistent with what many religions teach.''</p>
        <p>Religious groups routinely seek such proclamations, and since the proclamations do not have the force of law, involve no money from taxpayers, and call for no particular action, they are difficult to challenge in court, First Amendment experts said.</p>
        <p>''A declaration of support for religion is not the same as declaring National Dairy Week,'' said Barry Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State. ''Any time government embraces a particular religious viewpoint it violates the spirit of the Constitution.''</p>
        <p>Bruce Lincoln, the Caroline E. Haskell Professor of History of Religions at the University of Chicago Divinity School, added, ''With the exception of Islam, all the major religions emerged before Christianity, so there is no place for Jesus in their original foundations and scriptures.</p>
        <p>''They carefully worded this thing to make it look like they've just got a good guy here, and so the state of Texas can have a party for him without running into church-state problems,'' he said. ''It's patently fraudulent.''</p>
