        <p>IN 1978 Sister Jeannine was teaching English at St. Mary's School in Manhasset. She lived for those moments when she could introduce her young charges to the glories of the theater, be it a Shakespeare classic or a bubble-gum musical like ''Bye Bye Birdie.''</p>

        <p>IN 1978 Sister Jeannine was teaching English at St. Mary's School in Manhasset. She lived for those moments when she could introduce her young charges to the glories of the theater, be it a Shakespeare classic or a bubble-gum musical like ''Bye Bye Birdie.''</p>
        <p>That year she met the Rev. Bill Ayres while taping a radio program. Father Bill ran the broadcasting office for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockville Centre but also kept busy writing books about rock music and taping a weekly radio show that featured interviews with rock stars. He also dug jazz and Broadway show tunes, and in his spare time wrote poems and song lyrics.</p>
        <p>The two continued to meet. Romance bloomed.</p>
        <p>''It was a very happy time, but also a very difficult time for us,'' recalled the former Sister Jeannine, now Jeannine Ayres. ''We both realized that this was more than a friendship. I had taken the vow of poverty, chastity and obedience. I knew to give that up would be an immense sacrifice. Bill felt the same way.''</p>
        <p>After much soul-searching, she left the order. ''I had never lived on my own before,'' she said. ''I had never balanced a checkbook before, never found an apartment before. The sisters helped me find an apartment in Oyster Bay. They helped me with everything.''</p>
        <p>Father Bill left the priesthood the following year. The two married and settled in Huntington. Nineteen years ago, Michelle was born; five years later Suzanne followed.</p>
        <p>The two began building separate careers, looking all the while for a venture that would enable them to work together to help other people discover what Mr. Ayres calls ''a fuller dimension of life.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Ayres continued teaching, both high school and college. Mr. Ayres began a new radio program, ''The Bill Ayres Show,'' then as now on Sunday at midnight over WPLJ. The program features long introspective interviews with such mission-oriented rock stars as Bruce Springsteen and the late Harry Chapin, a Huntington neighbor dedicated to alleviating world hunger who became a regular visitor on his show. Mr. Ayres was sufficiently moved to help Mr. Chapin promote the World Hunger Year.</p>
        <p>The popular singer-songwriter died in an automobile crash on the Long Island Expressway in 1981. Two years later Mr. Ayres took over daily management of Mr. Chapin's foundation, a post he maintains to this day. It is not, however, his only outlet. Five years ago he and his wife, with two Huntington neighbors, founded a business called At the Water's Edge. (The other two partners have since left.)</p>
        <p>At the Water's Edge is one of some 50 business-coaching practices on the Island, and perhaps 8,000 nationally. Most are relatively new to the field, having until recently identified themselves as therapists or motivational counselors or something else entirely. They tend to blend the language of therapy with self-help rhetoric and more than a little New Age coinage, in the process developing a new discipline.</p>
        <p>Clients, or their employers, pay $75 an hour and up for a service that defies easy description. Says Mitchell Wolf, an accountant in Syosset and a satisfied client, ''Jeannine offers you a pat on the back, which is something you usually don't get in business.''</p>
        <p>Like many coaches, Mrs. Ayres says, she helps clients to maintain an emotional balance and engage in intuitive decision-making. In a new brochure, the Ayreses describe their coaching practice in these terms:</p>
        <p>''While at the water's edge you may discover transforming, healing places in your heart, while you discover treasure spots on Long Island. Through a blend of nature and the creative arts, we will help you relax and celebrate life.''</p>
        <p>Her clients say all this is true, but doesn't quite tell the story.</p>
        <p>The Ayreses, it turns out, do many things in the service of their clients, not all of whom in the business sector. But extracting a list of client services from the Ayreses is like asking the Sound to deliver next month's tide tables.</p>
        <p>''There isn't one thing I do for every client,'' said Mrs. Ayres, the New England in her voice having survived both her journey out of Massachusetts and years of drama and speech training. ''It all depends on what the client needs at this point in his or her growth. With some people I do yoga. With others I work on interpersonal communication skills.''</p>
        <p>Several times a year the Ayreses work as a team to conduct marriage retreats, often sponsored by church organizations. At one such retreat last year, they met Trish and Jim Matthews of Northport.</p>
        <p>The Ayreses ''are people who keep growing and are very creative and really understand how some aspects of life can destroy you individually and as a couple,'' Mrs. Matthews said. ''They helped Jim and I identify what are the forces of life for us as a couple, and how to make them more a part of our daily lives.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolf, the Syosset accountant, became a client last year in the hope of breaking out of a career rut. In his mid-40's, he felt he was stuck midway up the career ladder. He met the couple at an anti-hunger event, then phoned Mrs. Ayres for an appointment.</p>
        <p>Characteristically, she suggested they meet near water; Mr. Wolf picked Oyster Bay Cove. They agreed when to meet, but not when to stop. ''It doesn't make sense,'' Mrs. Ayres said, ''to walk away just when you're getting somewhere.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Ayres told Mr. Wolf that he came across as too anxious. ''People pick up on your stress level,'' she advised him. She taught him several yoga exercises. She suggested he make more eye contact when speaking. She showed him how to enter a room with more authority, falling back on her drama training to demonstrate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolf said he is delighted. ''I'm already seeing dividends,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Another client, Gaetane Roberts, sought Mrs. Ayres's help before opening her own consulting business, which teaches entrepreneurship to doctors. Ms. Roberts suggested that the coaching take place at Jones Beach, not far from her office in Wantagh.</p>
        <p>The meetings soon produced a breakthrough for Ms. Roberts and her fledgling business.</p>
        <p>''As we walked and talked,'' she said, ''I became very aware of the surroundings: the beautiful sun beating on the ocean, the rhythm of the waves, the way Jeannine was listening to me. Everything somehow started to flow inside of me. I began to remember the strong feelings of hunger I had as a child. I remembered being so hungry I took my baby brother's milk bottle and drank it. I remembered all the times I went to the lady next door and she fed me at her kitchen.''</p>
        <p>The years of poverty had distorted her self-esteem, she said. ''I always had that hunger belief system where you don't make much money but you think, 'That's O.K., that's what you're worth.' ''</p>
        <p>Meeting biweekly with Mrs. Ayres, Ms. Roberts no longer undervalues her services.</p>
        <p>''Recently I gave a presentation at a meeting of physicians and my body was shaking,'' she recalled, ''but I asked for the amount I really wanted. For the first time, I knew what I was worth. I believed that I was worth that amount.</p>
        <p>''And it worked.''</p>
