        <p>Paul Marx letter responds to Peter Applebome's July 23 column on loud, obscene rap music being played by man at gas pump (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Many readers responded to Peter Applebome's July 23 Soapbox column about racial mores and suburban manners at a gas station in Westchester County. The problem the column posed was what, if anything, to say to or do about the black gentleman sharing his expletive-laden music with the world and also Mr. Applebome's 9-year-old daughter.</p>
        <p>Here is a sampling of readers' reactions.</p>
        <p>The great divide in this country is not race, but culture. It wasn't the guy's skin color that angered you; it's how he was behaving. The big guy could have done a lot of other things that also would have angered you, but in his culture those behaviors may not be a big deal. Another big black guy at the gas pump, with a different attitude and manner, might have made you want to hug him.</p>

        <p>When people dislike behavior that another culture finds acceptable, they usually don't want to associate with those who engage in or support those behaviors.</p>
