        <p>NYMPHOMANIA</p>
        <p>A History.</p>
        <p>By Carol Groneman.</p>
        <p>238 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>W. W. Norton &amp; Company. $24.95.</p>
        <p>WHAT nymphomania is exactly has long been a matter of dispute. Historically it has been a legal and medical matter; it has also signified the condition of a woman who enjoys too much sex too often and been cited as proof of frigidity. Alfred Kinsey still summarizes it best: a nymphomaniac is a woman ''who has more sex than you do.'' In ''Nymphomania: A History,'' Carol Groneman has gathered some fascinating case material about American women who were defined by ''experts'' or who defined themselves as plagued by uncontrollable sexual urges.</p>
        <p>From the time the clitoris became a focus of medical attention in the middle of the 19th century, English and American gynecologists viewed it as a potentially pathological locus of pleasure and desire. Women themselves believed that ''sexual desire meant disease,'' Groneman writes, and they often voluntarily submitted themselves to treatments with caustics, purges, leeches, baths, douches, diets, sedatives and gynecological surgery (including clitoridectomies and hysterectomies) in order to suppress longing and preserve their chastity or marital vow of fidelity. At the beginning of the 20th century, Groneman writes, ''oversexed'' middle-class women began to be defined as frigid, while some immigrants with the same condition were labeled ''feeble-minded'' and then deported because lust led to ''delinquency.''</p>
        <p>By the 1920's, medical investigators began to focus on hormones; women were injected with estrogen or testosterone or both. Freud claimed that the true cause of nymphomania was women's failure to have vaginal rather than clitoral orgasms, a myth that was first debunked in the late 1940's and early 1950's by Kinsey. Finally, the American Psychiatric Association reclassified nymphomania in the 1980's as ''distress about a pattern of repeated sexual conquests with a succession of individuals who exist only as things to be used.''</p>
        <p>The bulk of the cases Groneman draws upon generally reflect the notes and published findings of doctors, psychologists and probation officers. Rarely do we get a glimpse into the way these so-called nymphomaniacs would have analyzed their own condition. Groneman, a professor of history at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, presumes, perhaps navely, that these accounts are accurate. Some of these yarns of women whose sexual demands drove their husbands to exhaustion and despair may have sprung from the fevered pens of misogynistic authors highlighting their successful cures or warning a credulous public of the dangers of voracious female sexual energy. Even Groneman's examples from contemporary sexploitation talk shows rely on transcripts. Interviews with participants might have clarified whether experiences were fabricated or exaggerated.</p>
        <p>More seriously, Groneman overlooks other narratives that would have enriched and enlightened her book. Black women have been routinely depicted as hypersexual, yet they barely appear in this book, and even contemporary stereotypes of Asian seductresses are excluded in Groneman's focus on the white middle class. Though she credits a feminist perspective like that of Margaret Sanger for comparing ''the average man's sexual technique to 'an orangoutang trying to play a violin,' ''the core of the feminist struggle to redefine female sexuality is underrepresented. Among the ignored (except for a note) is Shere Hite's ''Hite Report,'' which challenged the laboratory research of Masters and Johnson by integrating sexual acts and fantasies into emotional experiences.</p>
        <p>In the end, the primary material vastly outshines Groneman's analysis. Like the Loch Ness monster, nymphomania is more titillating in the darkness of the imagination than in the light of scholarly inquiry.</p>
