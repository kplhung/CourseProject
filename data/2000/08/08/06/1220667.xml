        <p>Even the crescent moon, redolent of Islamic religious symbolism as it hangs limpid over the Mediterranean on a hot summer's night, seems like a curse now to the embittered Lebanese Christian refugees making makeshift lives at this lovely old kibbutz a few miles south of the Lebanese border.</p>
        <p>Ten weeks ago, the 17 Lebanese families who now live here were among the 6,500 remnants of Israel's occupation of southern Lebanon who fled in panic into Israel when Prime Minister Ehud Barak, in his push for Middle East peace, suddenly withdrew Israeli forces after 22 years of occupation.</p>
        <p>Although the withdrawal was acclaimed in Israel, which had lost more than 1,000 troops in southern Lebanon, it spelled disaster for some 2,000 officers or men of the South Lebanon Army, the militia force of Christians, Muslims and Druze that had helped Israel maintain its grip.</p>
        <p>The militia members handled many of the occupation's less appetizing tasks. With their wives and children, they dashed helter-skelter across the border into Israel in cars laden with personal belongings, as towns and villages where they were once overlords were overrun by Hezbollah, the militant Islamic guerrilla force that harassed the Israeli forces and finally pushed them out.</p>
        <p>Now, the militiamen and their families are quartered at kibbutz guest houses, Israeli Army barracks and hotels across Israel, mainly in the rocky terrain that runs eastward from the port of Haifa to the Sea of Galilee.</p>
        <p>Their hope, and Israel's, is that most of them will eventually be accepted as immigrants by Australia, Canada, Germany, Sweden or the United States, or a handful of other countries with large Lebanese communities. So far, though, only about 400 of the refugees have obtained visas and moved on, while the rest remain in limbo in Israel.</p>
        <p>It is a situation replete with difficulties for the militiamen, and for Israel, as their alliance in Lebanon runs into underlying realities that always dogged ties between them.</p>
        <p>For one thing, Israel, despite the generous support it has offered so far, is not a natural long-term home for refugees who are at once Maronite Christians and Arabs.</p>
        <p>For another, many of the militiamen and their wives are deeply bitter about the pullout, believing that Israel should have stayed on in the occupation zone and given the militia the military backing to fight on against Hezbollah or, at least, offered more than the 36 hours' notice of the pullout the militiamen say they received.</p>
        <p>As they pass their days around plastic tables set out on the kibbutz's lawns, the Lebanese argue endlessly about their plight and their prospects.</p>
        <p>''They are liars, the Israelis; they promised us all good houses and look what we got, two rooms on a kibbutz!'' one woman said this week as she and her friends discussed the situation with a visitor, mostly requesting anonymity out of fear of reprisals against relatives still in Lebanon. Another woman, who asked to be identified by the pseudonym of Leila, responded angrily.</p>
        <p>''No, no, not liars,'' she said. ''We are 6,500 people, with nothing, and it's not reasonable to think the Israelis could find us all nice big houses.''</p>
        <p>Although about 400 of the original refugees have returned to Lebanon, the option has been virtually ruled out for most of the others by the 15-year prison terms that Lebanese military courts have handed out to 800 members of the militia force who took their chances by staying behind in Lebanon, or simply failed to leave in time.</p>
        <p>The sentences have been far more severe than most of the militia members feared after an earlier, partial pullout by Israeli forces from a part of the occupation zone last year. The members who gave themselves up then mostly got prison terms of a year or two, or even, in the lesser cases, immediate release.</p>
        <p>In the latest Lebanese trials, the men have been found guilty of ''collaborating with the enemy,'' Israel, and of ''entering an enemy state,'' Israel again, which militiamen and their families visited frequently for training, shopping and vacations before the pullout.</p>
        <p>Lebanese prosecutors have said they will stage trials in absentia for some senior officers who fled, and threaten sentences of life imprisonment at hard labor, without parole, especially for those linked to the torture and death of Lebanese who were victims of the occupation. These include Hezbollah prisoners who disappeared or died while in a notorious militia-controlled jail near the southern Lebanon town of Merj 'Uyun.</p>
        <p>At Kibbutz Kabri, a glorious setting of grassy lawns, spreading trees and flame-red bougainvillea bushes that looks down from rocky hillsides toward Haifa, almost all the refugee militiamen hail from Merj 'Uyun. Some were senior officers, majors and lieutenant colonels, others high-ranking members of the militia intelligence units associated with the worst abuses against civilians that occurred in the occupied zone.</p>
        <p>All now say they were blameless in the killings of civilians and Hezbollah prisoners. But even if they were, Israel has to deal now with men who presided, in the occupation zone, over a largely lawless society where drug running, car theft and extortion made easy fortunes for the powerful.</p>
        <p>All in all, Israel finds itself in a double bind, since the militiamen, many of them recruits when they were teenagers, and few with any professional or trade qualifications, will not be easy to integrate into Israeli society. At the same time, Western embassies in Tel Aviv, including those of Australia, Canada and the United States, have so far been grudging in granting immigration visas to militia applicants, perhaps fearing, in individual cases, that they might be accepting ne'er-do-wells, or even men wanted for murder or other forms of mayhem in Lebanon.</p>
        <p>For now, the militiamen and their families at Kibbutz Kabri are living in a modest degree of comfort that refugees elsewhere might envy.</p>
        <p>Each family has a two-room home in motel-like guest accommodations at the kibbutz. They can eat free meals in the kibbutz's communal dining room, or cook for themselves with free supplies -- meat, vegetables, milk and sugar, among other things -- that are delivered to the kibbutz two or three times a week. Each militiaman receives a monthly stipend of about $190, with $375 for couples, and an additional $37.50 for each child -- a total of about $450 to $500 for most families.</p>
        <p>All the refugees have been given temporary residence status in Israel, entitling them to free medical care, including hospitalization. An Israeli Army liaison officer assigned to each group acts as a kind of ombudsman and counselor. All refugee children who wish to will attend summer camps, and have places in the fall at Israeli schools that will offer Arabic-language classes taught from Lebanese textbooks. For adults, there are Hebrew lessons, an undertaking that has not, so far, proved too compelling for most students, with their eyes set on migrating elsewhere.</p>
        <p>An Israeli military spokeswoman, who declined to be named, acknowledged in a telephone interview from her office in Jerusalem that some of the Lebanese families were upset, particularly at the slowness of the Israeli bureaucracy in finding permanent housing for them, and at the seeming reluctance of Western countries where many have relatives to accept them as immigrants. ''Some of them are quite angry with Israel,'' she said. ''But we are working day and night to take care of these people, and to enable them to have a good life in Israel.''</p>
        <p>The costs, for Israel, have already run into millions of dollars, but there are few grateful voices at Kibbutz Kabri. A major complaint focuses on the suddenness of the Israeli withdrawal, which was completed virtually overnight, more than six weeks ahead of Prime Minister Barak's target date of July 7.</p>
        <p>The pullout left many militia families rushing to pack suitcases and driving flat-out to Israeli border posts, often with Hezbollah fighters right behind them, threatening to open fire.</p>
        <p>Many of the families abandoned cars in their panic, and threw suitcases across the border fence, causing clothes and other belongings to fall out and hang pathetically from the barbed wire. Once in Israel, many were provided with used clothing and other household necessities by Israelis. Some pooled their money to buy refrigerators and satellite dishes so that they could watch Lebanese television. For virtually all of them, it was a hard fall from their lives in Lebanon, where most had spacious homes, wardrobes full of expensive clothes and luxury cars.</p>
        <p>Among the men, conspiracy theories abound, including one that posits a secret deal between Israeli commanders and Hezbollah, the Lebanese guerrilla force. One former militia intelligence officer, cooking supper on a hot plate, noted that Israeli troops had completed their pullout without a single casualty. In the end, he suggested, it was a case of Jews -- Israeli officers -- consorting with the Muslims of Hezbollah against a secure future for Christians.</p>
        <p>''For all the evils of Lebanon, it is Christians who have to pay the price -- only Christians,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Among the women, though, there seemed to be little interest in the convoluted politics, just a concern for their families' futures. One woman broke into tears as she spoke to a visitor. ''Tell me, is there any future for us?'' she said. ''I have lost my home, my family, all my belongings. I feel destroyed. And now I am in a strange land, with no future. All I ask for is a little hope.''</p>
