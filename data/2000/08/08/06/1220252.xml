        <p>Six Crooked Highways</p>
        <p>By Wayne Johnson.</p>
        <p>Harmony, $23.</p>
        <p>Wayne Johnson's tart and cunning third novel is a sequel of sorts to ''Don't Think Twice,'' his previous book, where we first met Paul Two Persons, the owner of a small resort in the pristine Red Lake region of Minnesota. In that earlier book, a family enemy threatened to replace Paul's lodge with a casino; now someone wants to build a highway through his property on the Chippewa reservation where he grew up. When two men -- a young assistant at Paul's lodge and a descendant of a famous Chippewa chief -- die under mysterious circumstances, Paul tries to get to the bottom of the trouble. Johnson's sentences can be lovely: ''From the ridge, I studied the island now, our cabins, warm yellow lights coming on in the windows, a mother calling her boy in from the lake, where he was splashing with four others, a loon calling.'' But the central conflict of the novel -- the force of corrupt moneyed interests versus a man who respects the land -- is sometimes obscured by heavy plotting. The story grows to incorporate a thug called Tall Friend, his short partner and a double-dealing cop; we have a high-speed car chase, a car bombing and gunplay. Amid the hubbub, characters like Paul's wife are left half developed. Despite these faults, Johnson has carved a niche for himself in the field of reservation noir.</p>
