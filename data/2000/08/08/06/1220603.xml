        <p>TO the West, he is an aging despot with bloody hands, a brutal race-monger who terrorizes white farmers and black critics and fuels the violence that still churns through the countryside. But on this continent, many Africans are painting a strikingly different portrait of President Robert Mugabe.</p>
        <p>In South Africa, 54 percent of blacks in a recent survey said they supported the invasions of white-owned farms here. In Namibia, the prime minister praised Mr. Mugabe for highlighting the racial inequities in regional land ownership. And in Nigeria, a newspaper assailed the West for trying to demonize an African leader intent on redressing a historical wrong.</p>

        <p>TO the West, he is an aging despot with bloody hands, a brutal race-monger who terrorizes white farmers and black critics and fuels the violence that still churns through the countryside. But on this continent, many Africans are painting a strikingly different portrait of President Robert Mugabe.</p>
        <p>In South Africa, 54 percent of blacks in a recent survey said they supported the invasions of white-owned farms here. In Namibia, the prime minister praised Mr. Mugabe for highlighting the racial inequities in regional land ownership. And in Nigeria, a newspaper assailed the West for trying to demonize an African leader intent on redressing a historical wrong.</p>
        <p>Westerners might find this alternative view of Mr. Mugabe jarring. How can the villain also be a hero? How can he be praised for pursuing an honorable cause if his supporters commit murder? And as a result, even in the barrage of foreign media coverage about the crisis in Zimbabwe, little but condemnation for Mr. Mugabe is heard. Other opinions are dismissed as those of apologists, collaborators or worse.</p>
        <p>But in truth, the perceptual dissonance reflects mostly the lingering impact of this continent's painful colonial history on the modern-day lives of black Africans. The white regimes have been swept away, but all across Africa, the single most valuable and plentiful resource -- land -- remains in the hands of tiny white minorities. ''The media is highlighting the issue of violence,'' said Richard Sakala, a spokesman for President Frederick Chiluba of Zambia, last week. ''But I don't think they're talking about the core issue, about how land is distributed in that country.''</p>
        <p>In 1980, white rule ended in Zimbabwe, then Rhodesia, but today, whites -- who make up less than 2 percent of the population -- still control more than half of the arable farmland. The black majority ekes out a living in overcrowded tracts of stony soil. In six-year-old post-apartheid South Africa, blacks make up 75 percent of the population but occupy only 15 percent of the land. In Namibia, 10 years into independence, some 4,000 whites own about 44 percent of the territory.</p>
        <p>The racial disparities are achingly visible in Zimbabwe's rolling hills and lush valleys. More than 60 percent of the blacks in this country live off tiny slivers of land, growing their own food, going hungry when the soil wears out. Old people tell stories and sing songs about how the best land was taken by British settlers around the turn of the century. Today, from their meager plots, these  struggling peasants can often see and envy the vast, fertile farms of the whites.</p>
        <p>So while most blacks condemn the political violence, many welcome the spotlight that Mr. Mugabe has drawn to the land question, his pointed reminder that white settlers stole this land. And even in the highly urbanized cities, which voted overwhelmingly against Mr. Mugabe's governing party in June's parliamentary elections, that reality retains its bitterness.</p>
        <p>IN recent years, of course, Mr. Mugabe has not always been the champion of the landless. He officially abandoned Marxism in the mid-1990's and has used the promise of land reform mainly to curry favor with rural voters at election time. He blames whites for the slow pace of change, but his own government has lacked the political will, the administrative capacity and the cash to make land reform a reality. His government's announcement last week that it would take over 3,000 farms seemed calculated more to rile white farmers than to outline an immediately feasible plan.</p>
        <p>Some Africans, notably Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu, have sharply criticized him, calling for an immediate end to the farm invasions and the violence that has claimed the lives of as many as 30 government critics before the June elections. (Today, black squatters still occupy about 1,000 farms.) A strike last week by Zimbabwe's black unions and white business owners to protest the farm invasions brought the nation to a one-day standstill.</p>
        <p>But even those blacks who speak harshly of Mr. Mugabe's violent tactics recognize that the desperation for land is real. And some suspect that the harsh criticism from the West may be fueled, in part, by those who want to maintain the status quo. ''The power of the white settler lobby should not be underrated,'' the East African, a newspaper based in Kenya, warned in an editorial last month.</p>
        <p>Foreign aid donors and white farmers here agree that two million acres of fallow land should be turned over to black peasants. But despite the assurances from white farmers that they support land redistribution, they have repeatedly failed to systematically identify tracts available for sale.</p>
        <p>And Western governments and aid donors say violence on farms must end before they will provide promised financing. That makes some people seethe. ''When all is said and done, who are they to decide that historical injustices should play second fiddle to the problems on the farms?'' said Sam Moyo, a highly regarded land expert who is helping Zimbabwe's government negotiate with the white farmers union.</p>
        <p>There are other points of dissonance, too. While Western officials were cheering the opposition alliance of black union members, white farmers and white industrialists that swept into Parliament in June, some South Africans felt a nagging sense of unease.</p>
        <p>Morgan Tsvangirai, the leader of Zimbabwe's new opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change, said South African officials were so suspicious of his group that they asked whether he had links to the rebel movements in Angola and Mozambique, which were financed and supported by the white apartheid government through the early 1990's, in an effort to destabilize the black governments in those countries.  ''They were asking whether I have relations with Unita or Renamo and I told them no,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tsvangirai says he will oppose Mr. Mugabe for the presidency if he runs again in 2002. No matter what, he says, the man who led Zimbabwe for 20 years will go down in history as having destroyed his country.</p>
        <p>But even some Western officials disagree. They say if Mr. Mugabe succeeds in returning a significant chunk of land to the black majority, he will be viewed with some respect on the continent.</p>
        <p>''His legacy is not about stabilizing the economy or attracting foreign donors,'' said a white Western official, who has worked on economic issues in and around Africa for several years. ''It's the reason why he sat in a jail for so many years; it's the land,'' he said. ''And when the dust settles, he will get some sympathy in Africa. People may disagree about his tactics, but they'll say, 'This guy really did it.' ''</p>
