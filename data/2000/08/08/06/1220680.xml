        <p>In a dispute which may affect the entire wireless communications industry, Verizon Communications failed to reach a contract agreement with its unions by a midnight strike deadline last night.</p>
        <p>A walkout by more than 86,000 workers began at 12:01 a.m., but negotiations continued between the two sides.</p>
        <p>''Technically we're on strike, but progress is taking place and we hope to reach an agreement so people can report to work tomorrow morning,'' said Candice Johnson, a spokeswoman for the Communications Workers of America. ''The situation is very fluid.''</p>
        <p>A strike affecting about 25 million households and businesses in an area stretching from Maine to Virginia might create delays for Verizon customers who need telephone repairs, telephone installation or directory assistance from service representatives.</p>
        <p>Basic dial tone and automated services would remain functional, and emergency services like 911 would also operate normally. A strike would not affect Verizon's wireless service, which has 26 million subscribers. Verizon did not establish any hot lines or special numbers for customers having difficulties in soliciting services.</p>
        <p>Because the walkout started today, it was not expected to have as great an impact as it would have had if it were to begin on a weekday, when the volume of calls would be greater.</p>
        <p>Verizon, the company created when Bell Atlantic acquired GTE and formed an alliance with Britain's Vodafone AirTouch for wireless services, is the nation's largest provider of local telephone and wireless services, with 260,000 employees.</p>
        <p>On the surface, the dispute involves fairly ordinary labor issues, including wages, benefits, stress levels on the job and outside contracting of certain work. But, perhaps more important, Verizon and officials from the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers also failed to agree on how the union should be allowed to organize workers in Verizon's fast-growing wireless division. The union had sought to make it easier for wireless workers to join a union.</p>
        <p>According to people close to the talks, Verizon submitted a new proposal late yesterday.</p>
        <p>The new three-year contract proposal would raise wages 10.5 percent over three years, compared with 17.5 percent over five years, and would lower the percentage of the company's work force which could be affected by the migration of jobs as the result of the merger, to 4 percent from 6 percent.</p>
        <p>In addition, separate negotiations were initiated yesterday over the unions' request that organizing wireless employees be made easier.</p>
        <p>Workers at the company's old wireline operations, providing local and long-distance service, worry that the wireless arm will soon eclipse the rest of the company in importance.</p>
        <p>''Forget about the stress level of my job, with things like random monitoring of my calls by a supervisor or forced overtime,'' said Stephanie Harrison, 47, a customer service representative in Westchester County. ''I'm worried that in five years I won't have a job because wireless will be dominant and plain old telephone service will be very small.''</p>
        <p>The communications workers have predicted that revenue for the wireless division will grow by 86 percent between 1998 and 2003, compared with a 25 percent increase in revenue for local services. Nearly 80 percent of the 120,000 employees in the company's local telephone division are unionized, compared with fewer than 50 of the 32,000 workers in its wireless unit.</p>
        <p>A strike could have broad implications for many high-technology industries, which, in general, have not been unionized.</p>
        <p>The wireless communications industry already has more than 90 million subscribers and is adding 30,000 a day. The unions hope that if they win concessions that make it easier for them to organize Verizon's wireless workers, and if they then persuade the workers to join, workers at other wireless companies will become more enthusiastic about unionization.</p>
        <p>Verizon officials say that the wireless industry is so competitive that increased union representation of its wireless workers would put it at a critical disadvantage.</p>
        <p>''The only way unionization wouldn't be a competitive disadvantage to Verizon would be if all their competitors were unionized too,'' said Jeff Kagan, an independent telecommunications analyst. ''If only one or two of the companies are unionized and the rest are not, it will be like a ball and chain around the ankles of the ones that are.''</p>
        <p>One way the company has limited union influence even in its unionized local and long-distance divisions has been to contract out work to nonunionized companies for services like the installation of high-speed Internet lines. The unions strongly object to this practice, and they are arguing for limits on Verizon's ability to contract out certain tasks.</p>
        <p>''The pressures of the market can be fierce, but a fearful, non-union work force does not necessarily enhance competitiveness,'' said Harley Shaiken, a professor of labor issues at the University of California at Berkeley. ''At the core of this issue is whether companies will be able to compete in a human way.''</p>
        <p>The walkout comes at a delicate time for Verizon. The company is in the midst of establishing an identity for its new brand name around the country.</p>
        <p>And it was unclear late yesterday how long the strike might last. In 1998, the two unions struck Bell Atlantic for only two days, with little effect on customer service, winning a no-layoff clause and improved pension benefits.</p>
        <p>But in 1989, workers struck for 17 weeks against Nynex, which later merged with Bell Atlantic. Thousands of union members picketed, dozens of strikers were arrested and a backlog of nearly 250,000 installation orders built up. The unions succeeded in reversing a company demand that workers pay monthly health insurance premiums.</p>
