        <p>They sounded a cry for lower taxes in Pontiac, Mich., and rallied people in Durand with the promise that President Clinton was on the way out. A crowd of several thousand people in East Lansing got a pledge that the military would be strengthened. A smattering of people in Holly and Fenton got only waves and smiles as the train rattled by.</p>
        <p>It was the second straight day on the rails for Gov. George W. Bush and his running mate, Dick Cheney -- the second straight day of trying to turn the momentum from a convention into a mandate from Americans. And it took the Republican duo across much of the breadth of southern Michigan, where they spent about seven stop-and-go hours before abandoning the ground for the sky and flying here tonight.</p>
        <p>''I wish you could travel with us and see the great spirit of America,'' Mr. Bush told the people at the East Lansing rally. ''It lies in the heartlands of our country. It lies along the tracks that we've been on with people from all walks of life.''</p>
        <p>''Our pledge is that if you give us the opportunity to lead this nation, not only will we work on a positive agenda for what is right for our country,'' Mr. Bush added. ''Our pledge is that if you give us your trust, we will honor it.''</p>
        <p>As with much of the oratory that they used at the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney were offering indictments, both implicit and explicit, of President Clinton, and they were attaching Vice President Al Gore to whatever disappointments Americans had felt about Mr. Clinton's presidency.</p>
        <p>The large, enthusiastic crowds mostly gobbled it up. They toted signs with messages like, ''I'd rather be Bushed than Gored.'' They chanted, ''No more Gore! No more Gore!''</p>
        <p>At a few stops, a few people protesting Mr. Bush's support for capital punishment or opposition to abortion sought to thrust their own voices and placards into the picture, but they were well outnumbered.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's train trip through Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Illinois, which he was scheduled to tour on Sunday, represented a bid to win swing states that had voted Democratic in the last two presidential elections, and Mr. Bush made a point at several stops today to mention that his campaign was open to independents and Democrats, and he beckoned them aboard.</p>
        <p>He also articulated some bedrock conservative philosophies and proposals, summoning particular passion for the subject of lowering taxes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney, at the stop in Durand, said the train trip showed that he and Mr. Bush were going to ''carry this fight from border to border and coast to coast, because it's extraordinarily important that we have a change in Washington.''</p>
