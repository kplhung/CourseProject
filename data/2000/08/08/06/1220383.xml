        <p>AS Martha and the Vandellas sang, ''Summer's here and the time is right for dancing in the street.'' And if Scotto Savitt has his way, there will be lots of dancing, even well beyond the summer.</p>
        <p>When the 6-foot-5-inch Mr. Savitt walks down Main Street in Huntington, crowds greet him as if he were the mayor. ''I'm more like an ambassador,'' Mr. Savitt said. ''My job is to put people's hands together, so that they work together and have fun with each other.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Savitt, 44, is a consultant who works with towns, community organizations, nightclubs and bands to coordinate festivals, concerts, charity events and private parties. From the Long Island Fall Festival in Huntington to private soirees for Metropolitan Life Insurance and Arista Records, Mr. Savitt can adapt to the needs of his diverse clientele.</p>
        <p>In addition to event coordination, Mr. Savitt acts (he has performed on stage and on film in Howard Stern's ''Private Parts''), sings, is the host of WLIR's ''Scotto's Ska Watch,'' books music in local clubs (mostly dance-friendly ska, the horn-heavy forerunner of reggae) and manages the Scofflaws, a local ska band that has an international following.</p>
        <p>''Ska music is all about positive energy,'' Mr. Savitt said. ''That fun vibe, that's what I'm all about.'' He also works as a music publisher, placing songs for songwriters like Vance Brescia, of Northport, whose million-selling single, ''That Was Then, This Is Now,'' was the 1986 comeback for the Monkees.</p>
        <p>Raised in Huntington, Mr. Savitt, known professionally as Scotto, came from a family with deep roots in both show business and education. His mother, Rae, is a former cabaret singer. His father, Robert, is a retired Plainview superintendent of schools. His uncle, Duke Savitt, was a Boston radio personality and actor who hobnobbed with celebrities, like Judy Garland and John Garfield.</p>
        <p>''Everything was a big show business production for us,'' Mr. Savitt said. ''The family would have big Christmas pageants, and during the summers Duke would bring my cousins out to our home in the Hamptons and we'd put on plays like 'Death of a Salesman' and 'Tobacco Road.' Music, theater, film, I'm into all sorts of demented stuff.''</p>
        <p>In the 1960's, his two older siblings (his sister, Susan, is a retired North Babylon superintendent of schools and his brother, Steven, works for Tommy Hilfiger) turned him on to the Beatles and the Who, the foundation of the music of his generation. ''My roots were set when I was young,'' he said.</p>
        <p>So, what is a young teenager with a flair for theatrics and a love of music to do? Produce parties. And that is what he did at age 14. ''I was producing parties for my parents,'' he recalled with a distinctive booming laugh. ''I'd invite the Hamptons jet set, performers, club owners, the sophisticated crowd.''</p>
        <p>He soon began booking bands for Simpson Junior High School (now Huntington's Town Hall). Always bursting with energy, he acted in school plays and was elected sophomore class president.</p>
        <p>In 1978, he fronted a rock band, Sadin, with whom he performed for the Hamptons crowd, this time at places like George Plimpton's house for the likes of Jackie Onassis, Norman Mailer and Mick Jagger. He knew this was the life he wanted -- to entertain, whether it was acting, singing or booking the show.</p>
        <p>In college, he studied to become an elementary school teacher, but it was the early 1980's and schools were not hiring. He began substitute teaching and working full time as the manager for Sparks, a Huntington nightclub. It was here he meet Richard Brooks, who later formed the Scofflaws, and with whom he would forge a long-term friendship.</p>
        <p>After several incarnations, the Scofflaws began getting attention in 1994, and Mr. Brooks asked Scotto to help him run the band's business. At the same time, he began to book ska festivals, turning the music world's attention to Long Island's ska scene.</p>
        <p>''The Scofflaws carved out a market for ska,'' Mr. Savitt said, ''they paved the road. I just widened it and kept the traffic moving.''</p>
        <p>Although he is working on festivals across the Island, like the Freeport Festival and the Smith's Point Festival (Labor Day weekend), his heart belongs to Huntington. He has booked the Long Island Fall Festival in Huntington (Oct. 6 through 8), which draws 250,000 people, since its inception. ''It's a solid three days of music, entertainment, crafts, and everyone gets to know how great this town is.''</p>
        <p>The chief executive of the Huntington Township Chamber of Commerce, Dennis Sneden, said, ''Scott is an extremely creative individual who has helped the Chamber and the Huntington community reach new heights with his innovative insights and energy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Savitt said, ''I've really looked at different places to live, but Huntington has everything all these places offer. It's a completely eclectic tribe that has given so much, and I want to give something back to keep Huntington as cool as it is.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Savitt is developing a Web site that will pay tribute to Long Islanders in the music business, and when the Scofflaws are on tour next month, he hopes to audition for television and theater roles.</p>
        <p>How does he do it all? ''I operate in an existential realm for the most part,'' Mr. Savitt said.</p>
