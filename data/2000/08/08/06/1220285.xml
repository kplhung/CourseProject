        <p>DANIEL'S HEAD VILLAGE, a new resort in western Bermuda that is the island's first major foray into environmental tourism, is itself a giant recycling project: it sits on a windy 19-acre promontory owned by the government that once served as a Canadian military base.</p>
        <p>The property, which is having a partial opening this month, contains no new permanent structures. Most of its guest lodgings will be in tent cottages built on stilts; there will be 96, including 17 built over the water, when the resort is fully open, scheduled for October.</p>

        <p>DANIEL'S HEAD VILLAGE, a new resort in western Bermuda that is the island's first major foray into environmental tourism, is itself a giant recycling project: it sits on a windy 19-acre promontory owned by the government that once served as a Canadian military base.</p>
        <p>The property, which is having a partial opening this month, contains no new permanent structures. Most of its guest lodgings will be in tent cottages built on stilts; there will be 96, including 17 built over the water, when the resort is fully open, scheduled for October.</p>
        <p>''We could literally take all of these units up and the property would be pretty much back to its original state'' except for the landscaping, said the resort's general manager, Richard E. Quinn.</p>
        <p>There will also be 19 guest units in the former barracks, and a community center will be converted into the restaurant. The developer of the property, a California company called Destination Villages, is leasing the land from the Bermudan government.</p>
        <p>Daniel's Head Village is a far cry from the Bermuda of teatime and golf. But guests won't need to bring sleeping bags: the 16-by-16-foot tent cottages have two layers of acrylic fabric on an aluminum frame, with glass windows, a 16-foot veranda, ocean view, queen bed, sleep sofa and private bath with shower. Five will be solar-powered.</p>
        <p>There will be snorkeling, kayaking, windsurfing, sailing and scuba diving, but no motorboat rentals. Lectures and demonstrations in local culture and arts are also planned. Rates through October are $135 to $250 for two in a cottage.</p>
        <p>Despite the minimal impact on the land, the project has been ''highly controversial,'' said a member of the Bermuda National Trust, a conservation organization, speaking on condition of anonymity. Some Bermudans had hoped the site would become a park, and aesthetically, the resort has ''sort of spoiled the promontory,'' he added.</p>
        <p>The setting, which long had little vegetation because of its military use, ''looks rather stark at the moment,'' he said. ''But they're making a big effort to replant the place.''</p>
        <p>David H. Allen, the island's minister of tourism, hailed the project in a press gathering in New York as ''a new kind of tourism for Bermuda,'' representing an attempt to attract the traveler who is ''not just interested in sun, surf and sand, but wants to learn something.''</p>
        <p>Now, at the same time the government is trying to draw a different kind of visitor, it is working to improve access to the kinds of sights he or she might want to see. Later this summer, Mr. Allen said, a limited number of people will be allowed onto Nonsuch Island, a 14 1/2-acre nature reserve in Castle Harbour that is home to the Cahow, or Bermuda petrel, a bird once thought to be extinct. A new 350-foot walkway at Paget Marsh, where the island's indigenous plants are preserved, opened last year.</p>
        <p>''By this time next year we hope to have a five-day 'eco-experience' in place,'' Mr. Allen said.</p>
        <p>Some traditions die hard, though. At Daniel's Head Village, visitors will be able to rent not only mountain bikes but also Bermuda's famous mopeds.</p>
