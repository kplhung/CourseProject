      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>A column July 23 by Peter Applebome described a situation at a gas station in which he and his 9-year-old daughter were exposed to loud rap music with X-rated lyrics booming from the car of a black man wearing a prison guard uniform. He debated asking the man to turn the music down but decided not to. He asked readers what they would do. Here is a sampling of the many responses.</p>
        <p>I am always tempted to turn on a Wagner or Beethoven tape and blast back at them, whatever ethnic group or sex they might be. I glare at them with my teeth grinding. Then I remember, ''Gee, that stuff is being produced by corporations and generating billions of dollars into our economy.''</p>
