        <p>THE tango aficionados of New York -- a small but passionate group -- say that the tango can change your state of mind, the way you walk and how you dress. Women who once wore jeans and T-shirts start tango dancing and convert to gowns with slits and fishnet stockings. In a way, fishnets are the perfect metaphor for tango -- it is the dance form in which you reveal the most. Partners dance close, to music of grief, homesickness and hope.</p>
        <p>Yonel Letellier, 43, is a lover of tango. He wears stylish suits and polished shoes, kisses people on the cheeks when he meets them and speaks comfortably about uncomfortable subjects. He grew up in Trujillo, Peru, and was politically active against the military government during his days at the National University of Trujillo. In 1982, he moved to New York, driving a cab while studying English and economics. Eventually, he became a vice president for financial services for small businesses at the Chase Manhattan Bank.</p>

        <p>THE tango aficionados of New York -- a small but passionate group -- say that the tango can change your state of mind, the way you walk and how you dress. Women who once wore jeans and T-shirts start tango dancing and convert to gowns with slits and fishnet stockings. In a way, fishnets are the perfect metaphor for tango -- it is the dance form in which you reveal the most. Partners dance close, to music of grief, homesickness and hope.</p>
        <p>Yonel Letellier, 43, is a lover of tango. He wears stylish suits and polished shoes, kisses people on the cheeks when he meets them and speaks comfortably about uncomfortable subjects. He grew up in Trujillo, Peru, and was politically active against the military government during his days at the National University of Trujillo. In 1982, he moved to New York, driving a cab while studying English and economics. Eventually, he became a vice president for financial services for small businesses at the Chase Manhattan Bank.</p>
        <p>''For so many years, I was just studying and working, studying and working, 16 hours a day,'' he said. ''I was very lonely. When I started to tango, I started feeling human warmth again.''</p>
        <p>In 1998, he met Nadia Khalilpour at a Halloween tango party in Manhattan. Ms. Khalilpour, who is 34 and grew up in Tehran, Iran, was then a live-in baby sitter in Manhattan for a couple from Iran. The mother of the children, Nasim Alikhani, a tango devotee, took Ms. Khalilpour to the party.</p>
        <p>''Nadia has a very gentle manner,'' Ms. Alikhani said. ''She's always smooth, never abrupt. Living with her, I never heard her footsteps. She was always floating about. At the same time, she's a very strong and clearheaded woman.''</p>
        <p>At the party, Ms. Khalilpour was sitting in the shadows, not knowing how to tango and trying not to be noticed, when Mr. Letellier saw her. ''Just looking at her, I felt something strange, very, very strange, and I asked her to dance,'' he remembered. He led her around as she floated tentatively along. ''She was so different, extremely sweet, extremely feminine, so delicate,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Their courtship was also delicate, a slow accumulation of quiet conversations, at first on the telephone, then over dinner and in time in his Flushing, Queens, apartment, with tango music playing in the background. ''He's very romantic,'' said Ms. Khalilpour, who is now an assistant administrator at Hunter College. ''He likes red roses. He listens from his heart.''</p>
        <p>Soon, their tango friends could tell they had fallen in love by their body language on the dance floor. ''I had a Christmas party at my apartment and invited them,'' said the Rev. Gerald Wagner, a nondenominational minister who tangos seven nights a week. ''Yonel came a little later than she did. When he walked in, I happened to be dancing with Nadia, and she just softened and melted in my arms. I knew he was in the room.''</p>
        <p>On July 27, a Thursday, the couple were married at La Maganette, a restaurant in Manhattan that has a tango dinner-dance every Thursday night. As the guests stood close around the dance floor, Mr. Wagner, who officiated, began the ceremony by saying: ''Tonight, love brings together a former student revolutionary from Peru, now a banker, and an expatriate from Iran, now a college administrator. And they were brought together by the Argentine tango.''</p>
        <p>Afterward, guests celebrated by dancing, the women kicking their legs out of slit skirts, the men dancing with eyes closed like pianists in a reverie. Sometimes, two partners would pause and lean against each other momentarily, waiting for one to suggest a move.</p>
        <p>''Tango is about giving yourself to another person but keeping your own balance at the same time,'' said Deborah Winner, a guest. ''It's so characteristic of a good relationship, having your own strengths and stability and independence, yet being able to ride the horse in the direction it's going.''</p>
