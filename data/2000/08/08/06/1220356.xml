        <p>Best Bet</p>
        <p>Just how extensively Willem de Kooning reused and recycled his own paintings and drawings is the subject of an exhibition opening Saturday at Guild Hall in East Hampton. Organized by the Fort Lauderdale Museum and previously seen in Florida and at the Menil Collection in Houston, ''Willem de Kooning: In Process'' fittingly ends its national tour in the community where he lived and worked. Supplemented by tracings and transfers, the show, with Klaus Kertess as guest curator, focuses on 22 paintings and 8 drawings created between 1968 and 1987, many of which have not been shown before.</p>

        <p>Best Bet</p>
        <p>Just how extensively Willem de Kooning reused and recycled his own paintings and drawings is the subject of an exhibition opening Saturday at Guild Hall in East Hampton. Organized by the Fort Lauderdale Museum and previously seen in Florida and at the Menil Collection in Houston, ''Willem de Kooning: In Process'' fittingly ends its national tour in the community where he lived and worked. Supplemented by tracings and transfers, the show, with Klaus Kertess as guest curator, focuses on 22 paintings and 8 drawings created between 1968 and 1987, many of which have not been shown before.</p>
        <p>Along with ''Kenneth Koch/Bertrand Dorny,'' an exhibition of art books created collaboratively by the poet and the French artist, the exhibition runs through Oct. 8 at the museum on Main Street.</p>
        <p>While the public opening reception from 5 to 7 p.m. on Saturday is free, benefits connected with the show are not. Through Aug. 14, there's an Internet auction of works by such artists as Chuck Close, Jack Youngerman, Joe Zucker and de Kooning (www.guildhall.org). On Friday, a preview cocktail party takes place at 5 p.m. at Guild Hall, followed by dinner and dancing at the Springs home of de Kooning's daughter, Lisa de Kooning (tickets $500 and up; associates for dessert and dancing $100). There will also be an exhibition tour by Mr. Kertes at 1 p.m. next Sunday and a multimedia evening with music, film and discussion, with Edvard Lieber as host, at 7 p.m. on Aug. 15. (631) 324-0806.</p>
        <p>Powwow Power</p>
        <p>Devotees of powwows have it all this week, with one event ending today and another beginning a two-day run on Saturday. Today the Long Island Native American Task Force holds its fifth annual powwow benefit for scholarships for local American Indians. From 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. in Setauket's Elementary School on Main Street, representatives of tribes from the Americas and the Caribbean will show and demonstrate their arts and crafts and entertain, lead by the host drummer, Young Blood from the Shinnecock Reservation, and the Aztec Dancers from Mexico and Taino Dancers from Puerto Rico. The Grand Entry is at 1 p.m. (631) 654-2841.</p>
        <p>The scene shifts to Copiague and Tanner Park next Saturday and Sunday for the 20th Annual Paumanauke Powwow and Native American Festival. There will be traditional dancers, dance competitions, native foods and crafts shows and demonstrations from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. (631) 661-7558.</p>
        <p>Sailing Away</p>
        <p>Turning the Phoenix, a 71-foot copy of a vessel that plied the waters of Long Island at the turn of the century, into a living laboratory, the Vanderbilt Museum, Cornell Cooperative Extension Marine Program and the Coastal Ecology Learning Program begin Saturday a monthlong series of ''Family Eco Sails'' (weekends through Aug. 17) and ''Evening Cruises'' (Fridays and Saturdays through Aug. 26). From 2 to 5 p.m. and 6 to 9 p.m., passengers will help catch, observe and release marine creatures and even help work the ship, hoisting sails, charting course and taking turns at the wheel. The Phoenix sails from the Northport Village Dock. (631) 727-3910.</p>
        <p>Musical Benefits</p>

        <p>Three Shows in the Parks</p>
        <p>With three entries on tap, it's a good week for folks who like their musicals performed in the parks free.</p>
        <p>Today, the Broadhollow Players take us back to the era of pajama parties, bobby sox and pedal pushers and drive-in movies via Rydell High's class of '59 and ''Grease.''
