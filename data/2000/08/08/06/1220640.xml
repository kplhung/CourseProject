        <p>The World Open Tournament, held at the Adam's Mark Hotel in Philadelphia, June 28-July 4, ended in an eight-way tie for first place among the grandmasters Jaan Ehlvest of Estonia, Alexander Goldin of Israel, Joel Benjamin of Manhattan, Gregory Serper of Mayfield Heights, Ohio, Alexander Ivanov of Brookline, Massachusetts, John Federowicz of New York, Pavel Blatny of the Czech Republic and Sergei Kudrin of Chestnut Hill, Mass.</p>
        <p>When the first eight prizes were split, each winner received $3,950 for his 7-2 score. There were 182 entrants in this nine-round Swiss-system event.</p>
        <p>The most breathtaking battle of the tourney was Benjamin's victory over Emory Tate of Washington. After he had fallen behind positionally, Tate fought back with superb tactical skill, and Benjamin had to match him blow for blow to win a tense struggle.</p>
        <p>Against the French Defense, White's 2 d3 is usually the introduction to a King's Indian Attack arising from 2 . . . c5 3 Nf3 d5 4 Nbd2 Nc6 5 g3 g6 6 Bg2 Bg7 7 O-O Nge7. After 3 . . . d5, however, Benjamin played 4 Qe2, which transposes into Chigorin's method of meeting the French. It might be termed the Chigorin Attack Deferred.</p>
        <p>Tate's opening the center with 4 . . . de 5 de was an error. A better approach would have been 4 Ne7 followed by 5 . . . g7 and 6 . . . Bg7, similar to the above system against the King's  Indian Attack. Perhaps he had originally thought to play 5 . . . b6 and later discovered that 6 Na3 Ba6 9 Nb5 was strong for White.</p>
        <p>After Benjamin's 10 Bb5, the threat of 11 Bc6 bc appeared. Tate could stave that off for a moment with 10 . . .  Qb6, yet after 11 Qa4 a6 (what else?) 12 Bc6 (The alternative 12 O-O?! ab! 13 Qa8 Nf6 14 Nc2 Bd7 15 Qa3 Ne4 yields Black a bishop and a pawn for a rook while the white queen is uncomfortably placed) Qc6 13 Qc6 bc 14 O-O, Benjamin has the superior pawn formation.</p>
        <p>So, Tate, in positional trouble, put his faith in a sharp tactical battle with 10 . . . g5 11 Be3 f5.</p>
        <p>He hoped to diminish the scope of the white pieces by the further advances 12 . . . f4 and 13 . . . g4. But Benjamin took up the challenge with 12 ef ef 13 O-O-O!</p>
        <p>There was no feasible damage control for Tate. Maybe the best he could do was 13 . . . g4, yet 14 Bc6 bc 15 Ne5 Qc7 16 Nd7 Bd7 17 Qb3 Kg7 18 Qc4 Rad8 19 Bf4 Qb6 20 Rfe1 would have been powerful for Benjamin.</p>
        <p>Thus, 20 . . . Rfe8 21 Rd7 Rd7 22 Qe6 Qd8 23 Bh6 Kh8 24 Qe5 Bf6 25 Qe8 Qe8 26 Re8mate. Or 20 . . . Rf7 21 Bh6 Kg6 22 Re7! Re7 23 Rd6 Kh5 24 Bf4 Be6 25 Re6 Re6 26 Qe6 and Black is done for.</p>
        <p>Against 13 . . . f4, Benjamin offered  a piece with 14 h4!, smashing open lines for a mating assault. Tate had to decline because 14 . . . fe 15 hg Rf7 16 Bc4 Kf8 17 Rh7! Rh7 18 Qh7 forces mate.</p>
        <p>He tried to keep the h file closed with 14 . . . gh, but Benjamin wrecked the plan at once with a second bishop sacrifice, 15 Bc5! Bc5 16 Rh4.</p>
        <p>Defense by 16 . . . Rf7 would be defeated by 17 Bc4 Qf6 18 Qh7 Kf8 19 Bf7 Qf7 20 Qh8 Ke7 21 Rh7.</p>
        <p>After the haughty 20 Kb1, Tate was bereft of defenses. But he went through with 20 . . . h5 21 Rh5 Nh5 22 Rh5 Kg7 23 Qh7 Kf6 24 Rh6 Ke5 25 Nf3mate.</p>
