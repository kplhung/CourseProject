        <p>Israel's fractious parliament gave a little breathing room and a thumb in the eye to Prime Minister Ehud Barak and his embattled efforts to reach a compromise on Jerusalem with Yasir Arafat and nail down the terms of a final peace accord this summer.</p>
        <p>In one vote on Monday, Mr. Barak's government survived a no-confidence motion mounted by opponents of the peace effort. But in a second vote that day, Mr. Barak's candidate for the largely ceremonial Israeli presidency, Shimon Peres, was defeated in favor of the opposition Likud candidate, Moshe Katsav. Two days later, Mr. Barak's foreign minister, David Levy, resigned.</p>
