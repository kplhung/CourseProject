        <p>In the days leading to the Democratic convention, Vice President Al Gore plans to tour several important battleground states, from Georgia to Pennsylvania to Michigan, hammering at the emerging themes of his campaign: that the presidential election will be about substance versus flash and new ideas against old, his aides said today.</p>
        <p>In separate appearances with Southern Democratic governors, President Clinton and his soon-to-be-announced running mate, Mr. Gore will focus on a different issue each day, including welfare, Social Security, health care and the economy, seeking to draw sharp differences in style and policy with his Republican rival, Gov.

        <p>In the days leading to the Democratic convention, Vice President Al Gore plans to tour several important battleground states, from Georgia to Pennsylvania to Michigan, hammering at the emerging themes of his campaign: that the presidential election will be about substance versus flash and new ideas against old, his aides said today.</p>
        <p>In separate appearances with Southern Democratic governors, President Clinton and his soon-to-be-announced running mate, Mr. Gore will focus on a different issue each day, including welfare, Social Security, health care and the economy, seeking to draw sharp differences in style and policy with his Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.</p>
        <p>''This tour will offer a striking contrast to the Bush campaign's approach of image rather than issues, photo-ops rather than substance,'' Mr. Gore's press secretary, Chris Lehane, said.</p>
        <p>The ''Going the Distance Tour,'' as the Gore campaign has dubbed it, will begin on Tuesday in Nashville, when the vice president will appear for the first time with his running mate. It will end on Tuesday, Aug. 15, in Michigan when Mr. Gore stands shoulder-to-shoulder with Mr. Clinton for a symbolic passing of the party's leadership torch.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore will arrive at the convention in Los Angeles the next day, and will accept the party's nomination the night of Thursday, Aug. 17. Mr. Clinton is scheduled to address the convention on Monday night and then leave the next day, effectively clearing the stage for Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>The vice president has previewed many of the themes he plans to emphasize during his tour in speeches over the past two days. The tour is also intended to highlight Mr. Gore's biography, and today in remarks before the National Association of Police Organizations in Washington, he talked extensively about his time as an Army reporter in Vietnam and as a police reporter for The Nashville Tennessean newspaper.</p>
        <p>''I saw a lot and gained a tremendous respect for what law enforcement officers do every day,'' he said. He added with a smile that he was ''one of those good'' reporters and not one who tried to dig up dirt on police officers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore told the group that he would push for ''common sense''  laws to keep guns out of the hands of children and criminals. He noted that in Congress, he had supported bills banning so-called cop-killer bullets and plastic guns. In doing that, he drew an implicit contrast with Mr. Bush's running mate, Dick Cheney, who voted against both bills while a congressman from Wyoming.</p>
        <p>The vice president heralded the administration's efforts to help police departments hire 100,000 new officers, and said he would push for money to hire 50,000 more. He also said he would fight to allow officers to carry their weapons while off-duty and for a constitutional amendment guaranteeing victims the right to be heard at criminal proceedings involving their attackers.</p>
        <p>The police group, which endorsed the Clinton-Gore ticket in 1996, has not decided whom to support this year. But in introducing Mr. Gore today, the group's president, Thomas J. Scotto, warmly praised Mr. Gore, saying the group has had a relationship with the White House that ''is probably the envy of all other law enforcement groups and politicians throughout this country.''</p>
        <p>From Washington, Mr. Gore flew here to spend the weekend on Long Island attending three fund-raising events.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore continued to hold any vice-presidential decision close to the vest. When he landed this afternoon at the Suffolk County Airport, reporters asked him if he was close to making a decision.</p>
        <p>''I'm about two and a half days away from it now,'' he said, stating the obvious, since he has imposed a deadline on himself for an announcement at noon on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore was attending two fund-raisers tonight for the Democratic National Committee. He raised $250,000 at a fund-raiser sponsored by Scott Bessent, a hedge-fund manager, and Will Trinkle, a real estate developer, from about 100 people, many of them gay or lesbian.</p>
        <p>At a later dinner, he raised $1 million from about 100 people at the home of Craig Hatkoff, a real estate developer, and Jane Rosenthal, a film producer who, with the actor Robert De Niro, founded the Tribeca Film Center.</p>
        <p>Other guests at the events included Christie Brinkley, the model; Andrew Tobias, the author; Charles Nolan, the designer; and John Sykes, the president of VH-1.</p>
        <p>From Long Island, Mr. Gore heads to Nashville on Sunday afternoon to prepare for the announcement of his vice-presidential pick on Tuesday. He will travel on Wednesday with his running mate to Carthage, Tenn., Mr. Gore's hometown. They will hold a town hall meeting at the Carthage elementary school with about 150 Tennessee residents, many of whom will reminisce about Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>From there, they will travel to the home state of the vice-presidential candidate. Speculation is narrowing to three Democratic senators -- John Kerry of Massachusetts, John Edwards of North Carolina and Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut.</p>
        <p>Chatting with reporters outside a fund-raiser here, Ed Rendell, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, suggested that religion could be a factor in the vice-presidential selection. He said Mr. Lieberman, an Orthodox Jew, would be ''a bold and courageous choice.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Rendell, who is Jewish himself, added, ''I don't think anyone can calculate the effect of having a Jew on the ticket.''</p>
        <p>If Mr. Lieberman were Episcopalian, Mr. Rendell said, ''it would be a slam dunk.'' Still, he said, picking Mr. Lieberman would probably not cost too many votes because those who would oppose Mr. Lieberman because he was Jewish would probably not vote for the Democratic ticket in the first place.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rendell also said that William S. Cohen, the Republican who is secretary of defense, could have been the candidate if he had not announced that was voting for Mr. Bush. ''He might be our candidate -- he'd be dynamite,'' he said.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, Mr. Gore and his running mate will go to Atlanta for a meeting with Southern governors and a discussion on welfare.</p>
        <p>On Friday, it is on to the Philadelphia suburbs for an event with working women. On Saturday, they will travel to western Pennsylvania and the girlhood home of the late Rachel Carson, the environmental advocate and author of ''Silent Spring,'' a book that Mr. Gore says strongly influenced him.</p>
        <p>Next Sunday, Mr. Gore plans to discuss children's health care at University Hospital in Cleveland. On Aug. 14, the day the Democratic convention opens, Mr. Gore will be in Independence, Mo., home of Harry S. Truman, where he will discuss issues involving senior citizens.</p>
        <p>That night, Mr. Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, will speak at the convention. Mr. Gore  will meet Mr. Clinton on Tuesday at an as-yet-undesignated spot in Michigan, a crucial state, where they will showcase the nation's economic expansion and try to highlight Mr. Gore's role in the prosperity.</p>
        <p>The next day, Mr. Gore will fly to Los Angeles, where his running mate will be nominated. Thursday night, Mr. Gore gives his acceptance speech and flies out that night to the Midwest, where he will begin a four-day boat trip across the Great Lakes and down the Mississippi River.</p>
