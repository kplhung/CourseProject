        <p>LINDA EDER'S followers are not your run-of-the-mill music fans. Many are Jekkies -- those obsessed with Broadway's ''Jekyll and Hyde,'' the musical in which Ms. Eder attained national recognition playing the prostitute Lucy Harris.</p>
        <p>Many Jekkies have seen the play at least 25 times, and closely follow the careers of its principals, especially Ms. Eder. There are Web sites and chat rooms devoted to her, allowing her fans to prattle over every move she makes, every note she sings.</p>
        <p>But it is not just her fans who are ready to propel the 39-year-old Ms. Eder to the top of the diva heap. She has legions of admirers, including celebrities (Rosie O'Donnell and Kathie Lee Gifford have both called her unparalleled) and journalists (one Chicago critic compared her to Barbra Streisand, Judy Garland, Celine Dion and Ella Fitzgerald, saying Ms. Eder surpassed them all).</p>
        <p>A flawless crystalline soprano, the high note she reaches is F above high-high C (she says she can even go higher ''with a weird little whistle thing''). She is also noted for impeccable phrasing. Much of her material is written by her husband, Frank Wildhorn, the composer of ''Jekyll and Hyde,'' ''The Scarlet Pimpernel'' and ''The Civil War.''</p>
        <p>Their collaboration has brought criticism from those who feel she needs to break away from one writer, but Ms. Eder, who mostly collaborates with Mr. Wildhorn and the lyricist Jack Murphy, says she is spoiled.</p>
        <p>''How lucky am I?'' she said, talking from her upstate New York home while waiting for a car to bring her to Manhattan for a recording session. ''I have a wonderful writer who writes for me. He knows my voice. I think singers would be envious of that arrangement.''</p>
        <p>Among the things that draw fans to Ms. Eder is her down-home attitude. For a woman on the brink of stardom, she appears modest and level-headed.</p>
        <p>''I have nothing burning left to do,'' said Ms. Eder, who greeted her fans nightly at the ''Jekyll and Hyde'' stage door. ''Fame isn't important to me. Being happy is. And I've never been happier.</p>
        <p>''Life goes so fast, I don't want to miss the wonderful things I have. When I turned 9, my mother said to me, 'You'll never be 8 again,' and I've always remembered that.</p>
        <p>''I know I'm on the brink of something big, I just don't know how much I want to invest in it,'' said Ms. Eder, who has an 11-month-old son, Jake. ''I love my baby, my husband, my horses, my life. I've fulfilled my dream. You have to make a lot of sacrifices for that kind of life.''</p>
        <p>But how tempting is it to be the next Celine Dion, a goal many believe is within her reach? ''I look back at the price that she paid, and I'm not interested,'' Ms. Eder said.</p>
        <p>Her tango with fame might be out of her control since her debut at Carnegie Hall on Feb. 2. She received six standing ovations and rave reviews, and is now in demand. She's been receiving movie scripts and she is working on an album with a mainstream pop sound.</p>
        <p>A former ''Star Search'' winner (a 12-week champion), Ms. Eder, whose favorite singers include Ms. Streisand, Ms. Dion and Faith Hill, knows how to dazzle a crowd. In ''Jekyll and Hyde,'' she just about stole the evening with her sweeping ballads.</p>
        <p>She has dazzling high notes, a rich, warm timbre and the ability to give up her ego to the song. Whether it is her soaring rendition of ''Unusual Way'' from the musical ''Nine,'' the pop song ''Never Dance,'' or her fiery version of ''Man of La Mancha,'' Ms. Eder has full control over her music.</p>
        <p>''People react to it for many reasons,'' she said of ''Man of La Mancha.'' ''It's a good song, and I do it differently than its original arrangement. It's more energetic. Plus, it's a woman performing a man's song. It also has those fifth-gear, goosebump moments. It gives me the goosebumps.''</p>
        <p>She said she liked those goosebump songs and ''I pack my concerts with them.''</p>
        <p>Negotiations are in progress for a ''Jekyll and Hyde'' television special. Ms. Eder is also recording a Christmas album with a gospel choir, and is readying her fourth pop record (her most recent was last year's ''It's No Secret Anymore''). She will return to Carnegie Hall on Dec. 18, and there's a new Wildhorn musical, ''Havana,'' in which she'll star in the autumn of 2001.</p>
        <p>Although she is constantly compared to Ms. Streisand, Ms. Eder is quick to point out that when it comes to show tunes and standards, ''nobody's as good as Barbra is.''</p>
        <p>''When people come up to me and say, 'You're better than Barbra Streisand,' I smile and say, 'Thank you,' and say to myself, 'They don't know what they're talking about.' ''</p>
        <p>LINDA EDER AND MICHAEL FEINSTEIN</p>
        <p>PNC Bank Arts Center, Exit 116, off the Garden State Parkway, Holmdel.  Today at 8 p.m.  (201) 507-8900.</p>
