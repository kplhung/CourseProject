        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I read with great interest of the ''discovery'' of Tintoretto's ''Raising of Lazarus'' at the Wernersville Novitiate [''A Tintoretto Reappears in Rural Pennsylvania'' by Ken Shulman, July 23]. As a Jesuit and an artist I can assure you that there is more out there should one care to investigate. Jesuit houses in this country generally lack an appreciation of fine art. I recall a beautiful Bassano ''Nativity'' that hung over the TV set in the recreation room at the St. John's residence in Shreveport, La. The smoke from years of cigarettes and cigars had blackened the painting to where it was almost unrecognizable. The painting ended up under the bed of the superior, who finally sold it off to dealers unknown. Campion Hall at Oxford University is another matter, where the Rev. Martin d'Arcy, a scholar and distinguished connoisseur, assembled an admirable collection that is cherished to this day.</p>
