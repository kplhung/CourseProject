        <p>WAREHOUSE distribution buildings, some as large as city blocks, are sprouting across New Jersey.  Hoping to lasso the state's bullish industrial market, developers are constructing such buildings with -- or without -- specific tenants in place.</p>
        <p>Two projects illustrate the different approaches developers are taking to meet what they say -- and commercial brokers agree -- is an unmet demand for modern warehouses with high ceilings of 32- to 38-feet, to accommodate racking systems.  ''Businesses change, and a 1930's warehouse can no longer serve the needs of a year 2000 company,'' said David T. Houston, the president of Colliers Houston, a commercial real estate brokerage and services firm in Teaneck.</p>
        <p>The demand, Mr. Houston added, is coming from tenants who are expanding into new buildings or consolidating operations to increase efficiency.</p>
        <p>In the Secaucus section of the Meadowlands, Hartz Mountain Industries will start driving piles next month for a 338,850-square-foot industrial building for the Lantis Eyewear Corporation, a designer and distributor of sunglasses, based in Manhattan. Lantis will consolidate its warehouse, distribution and administrative functions, which are now in three different locations in Bergen and Hudson Counties.</p>
        <p>The new building on Secaucus Road is  expected to be completed next summer.  Lantis will lease the building, which will provide the growing company with an additional 100,000 square feet of space, for 15 years. The project's estimated cost, including the value of the lease, is over $40 million.</p>
        <p>Hartz, which is one of the largest property owners in the Meadowlands, is also in negotiations with another tenant to build a second 300,000-square-foot building on the same 35-acre Secaucus Road site.</p>
        <p>Heller Industrial Parks is taking a different tack in Edison, where it has begun work on a speculative project. Its two buildings,  one with 171,411 square feet and the other with 958,446 square feet, will rise on 52 acres in the company's 410-acre industrial park at the end of Mill Road. The $34 million project  will include a $1 million 8,937-square-foot children's day-care center, which will replace a smaller center that will be razed to make way for the new buildings.</p>
        <p>The 1.3-million-square-foot development follows two earlier speculative projects, with one with one million square feet and the other with 1.25 million, that Heller, which is based in Edison, has built in the last five years at the park. The two new buildings, expected to be finished in the next 12 months, will complete the park, which will eventually contain nearly eight million square feet of space.</p>
        <p>The Secaucus and Edison buildings are  part of a spate of projects totaling 5.2 million square feet now under construction in the 11-county northern and central New Jersey market. The current pace of construction is consistent with that of the last two years, when 12.5 million square feet was completed, brokers said.</p>
        <p>But the focus of the new construction, they added, has increasingly been on speculative projects. Tenants often want warehouses to be ready when they decide to enter or expand in markets, Mr. Houston of Colliers Houston and other commercial brokers said.</p>
        <p>MUCH of the new space continues to go up in the central part of the state.  Such traditional magnets as Edison and the area around Exit 8A of the New Jersey Turnpike are particular hot spots. The activity is also moving farther south on the turnpike to Exit 7A in Mercer County but is limited in northern New Jersey by the lack of suitably zoned land.</p>
        <p>Despite the addition of new space, ''the rate of construction has not exceeded demand,'' Mr. Houston said, adding that large blocks of space of 200,000 to 500,000 square feet are difficult to find. Strong leasing activity and the conversion of older industrial buildings to technology centers has kept the lid on supply, he said.</p>
        <p>In the second quarter the industrial vacancy rate in the northern and central parts of the state dropped to 3.2 percent from 4.4 percent in the second quarter of 1999. At the same time, average rental rates have hovered around $5 a square foot a year, according to Grubb &amp; Ellis, the commercial brokerage firm.</p>
        <p>Joel M. Orenstein, a senior vice president of Grubb &amp; Ellis, noted that the new buildings were often substantially leased before they were completed. An example is the 300,000 square feet of space that Anixter, a Chicago-based distributor of data communication products and electrical wire and cable, has leased in a 501,400-square-foot building under construction at the 150-acre Cranbury Business Park, three miles from Exit 8A. Mr. Orenstein, who represented Anixter in the transaction, said the company would be expanding from a smaller space elsewhere in the 8A area.</p>
        <p>Most brokers said the overall industrial market was expected to remain healthy through the rest of the year. Mr. Orenstein, for example, said that he knew of five prospective tenants who were looking for buildings of one million square feet or more in New Jersey, and four others who needed  200,000 to 400,000 square feet. He would not name them.</p>
        <p>Tenants' demands for larger blocks of space is what Heller Industrial Parks is banking on to fill its two new buildings in Edison. Jeffrey J. Milanaik, the company's president, said that despite the risks involved in so large a speculative project, which the company is financing itself, ''it enables us to achieve an economy of scale.''</p>
        <p>The smaller 171,000-square-foot building will be divided in half, and two prospective tenants have expressed interest in the space, Mr. Milanaik said. He said the larger  958,446-square-foot building has been designed for tenants needing 200,000 square feet or more, but the space could be divided into areas as small as 70,000 square feet.</p>
        <p>T HE current project, like the earlier ones at the industrial park, has received a five-year tax abatement from the Edison Township Council. ''We needed a little help because the cost of constructing on the site is more expensive'' -- costs have gone up and the soil is softer than usual, Mr. Milanaik said. But with the abatement,  rents can be kept competitive at $5.25 a square foot, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Milanaik said if the ''market holds steady until next year,'' he expected his company to move into the Interchange 8A market with a 202-acre project in South Brunswick that will have up to four million square feet in five buildings. He said the  first 1.25-million-square foot building would be built on speculation.</p>
        <p>Commercial brokers said the Meadowlands region continued to draw attention from tenants that want to be near Manhattan. That area, which covers parts of seven communities in Bergen and Hudson Counties, has a vacancy rate of 3.2 percent and  average rents of $5.80 a square foot, the highest in the state, according to Grubb &amp; Ellis.</p>
        <p>''Until the inventory of existing space was absorbed over the last five years, the cost of constructing new buildings was still greater'' than renovating existing ones, said Emanuel Stern, the president of Hartz Mountain Industries, which has enough vacant sites in the Meadowlands to accommodate buildings totaling one and half to two million square feet. ''Now we're seeing the demand for space push into our developable land.''</p>
        <p>Hartz had originally planned to build a 300,000-square-foot outlet mall on the Secaucus Road site where the Lantis Eyewear project will rise. ''While the market for outlet malls has not been hot, the industrial market here is hopping,'' Mr. Stern said, explaining why he dropped the plans for the mall.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Stern said his company ''toyed with the idea of building a speculative ware-house'' on Secaucus Road, the deal with Lantis Eyewear surfaced.</p>
        <p>The deal ends a yearlong search for new quarters for Lantis, which has grown to 750 employees in the last decade, 450 of them working in the three New Jersey locations. ''We are totally jammed in and hungry for space,'' said Lon J. Moellentine, the company's president and chief executive.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moellentine said his company looked at speculative buildings in ''the middle of cornfields as far as 7A on the turnpike,''  before opting to join with Hartz at the Secaucus site. ''We were driven by labor,'' he said, noting that ''while rents are significantly higher in northern New Jersey, that will be offset by the benefit of continuity.'' He said he expected all of his New Jersey employees to make the move to the Secaucus property, which will ''give us room to grow.''</p>
