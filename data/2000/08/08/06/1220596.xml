      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>A column July 23 by Peter Applebome described a situation at a gas station in which he and his 9-year-old daughter were exposed to loud rap music with X-rated lyrics booming from the car of a black man wearing a prison guard uniform. He debated asking the man to turn the music down but decided not to. He asked readers what they would do. Here is a sampling of the many responses.</p>
        <p>Sure it isn't pleasant (I admit I play my music quite loud, but I always turn it down at stoplights, gas stations, and so on) but one just has to deal. Plus hiding your child from that type of music isn't a good idea.  One has to explain to their kids that this is bad. I would also point out that it's rude, but hey, give the guy a break. Maybe he had a rough day, I'm sure it wasn't a walk in the park being a prison guard. As long as he keeps the bad guys in, he can blast  whatever he wants as far as I'm concerned.</p>
