        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The Bobover rebbe, Rabbi Shlomo Halberstam (obituary, Aug. 3), was unshakable in his belief that God's character and thought processes are beyond the comprehension of mortals: we simply have no basis for questioning his actions.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The Bobover rebbe, Rabbi Shlomo Halberstam (obituary, Aug. 3), was unshakable in his belief that God's character and thought processes are beyond the comprehension of mortals: we simply have no basis for questioning his actions.</p>
        <p>Consequently, the rebbe meticulously conducted his life as an observant Jew in the dark days of the Holocaust. It was a profound test of faith from which he did not flinch.</p>
        <p>Your obituary speaks of the rebbe's shaving of his beard as part of a ''crisis of faith,'' when nothing could be further from the truth. That act was an essential one of self-preservation to protect himself from those who targeted leaders capable of transmitting Jewish heritage and thereby rebuilding a vibrant Jewish world. The rebbe's success in working undercover to save the lives of others, inspiring them spiritually, and then in rebuilding Jewish life after the war, affirms the correctness of his judgment.</p>
