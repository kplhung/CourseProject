        <p>IT was May 1984. Annemarie O'Sullivan, 17, as good an athlete as North Salem High School has produced, was watching the Olympic track and field trials on television with her younger sister Deirdre.</p>
        <p>''We looked at the times,'' Deirdre said, ''and realized Annemarie wasn't that far off in the hurdles. She'd done 61.2 seconds for 400 yards already.</p>
        <p>'' 'Someday,' Annemarie said, 'I'd like to try for an Olympic medal.' ''</p>
        <p>Annemarie O'Sullivan has her medal now, more than one of them. But they are from the Special Olympics.</p>
        <p>Between those two different medals is a story of pain, determination and triumph; a story of a remarkable young woman and the family that rallied around her.</p>
        <p>Anna O'Sullivan, her mother, tells it in a bright Irish lilt.</p>
        <p>''It was in October of 1984,'' she began. ''It was a dreary Friday morning, the leaves falling off the trees. Annemarie and Deirdre were both on a North Salem field hockey team, which had won its league and was in the playoffs. They were driving around the bend by the school when something happened, we'll never know what, and Annemarie lost control.''</p>
        <p>The car spun off the road and smashed into a tree on the driver's side. Annemarie's neck and pelvis were broken, and her frontal brain and brain stem were damaged.</p>
        <p>''The doctors gave her an E.E.G., saw no activity and said it was hopeless,'' Mrs. O'Sullivan said. '' 'Just leave her plugged in,' I said.</p>
        <p>''She was in a deep coma for four and a half months, a lighter coma for two and a half more. Then on May 4, 1985 -- oh, God, that was a day -- she bolted up as my husband entered the room and said 'Hi, Dad!' ''</p>
        <p>It was just a start. With permanent motor damage on her right side, Annemarie had to be taught to write left-handed and, with her parents and four siblings helping, had to relearn almost everything else.</p>
        <p>Two and a half years after the accident, she got her high school diploma.</p>
        <p>Deirdre, who broke her collarbone in the accident, has become a physical therapist, partly, she said, because of her sister's struggle. ''She's fine with concrete things,'' Deirdre evaluated, ''but abstract things can be a problem. She varies a lot.''</p>
        <p>The love of athletics returned. Deidre said: ''We were watching the World Games on television about eight years ago and suddenly Annemarie started crying. 'I want to run again,' she said.''</p>
        <p>And run she did, thanks to the efforts of North East Westchester Special Recreation in Hawthorne, which caters to the developmentally disabled.</p>
        <p>The North East director, Nancy E. Troiano, observed her progress. ''She had a hitch in her stride, but you could see she was an athlete,'' she said. ''Sometimes she'd even correct our coaches on technique.''</p>
        <p>Special Olympics medals started rolling in. At her last competition, Annemarie won the softball toss and 100-yard dash and took a third in the 50.</p>
        <p>''I remembered I loved winning,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Determination has gone a long way. Annemarie also works part time at three jobs.</p>
        <p>When she went to the rehabilitation center, Annemarie recalled: ''I said I want to get out of this wheelchair, to walk by myself. Then I got a walker -- I left that behind. Then I got a cane -- I left that behind.''</p>
        <p>Now she is leaving Special Olympics opponents behind. She won the 100-yard dash in her category recently in 21.09 seconds, impressive for a 33-year-old with a hitch in her stride but far from the 13.5 seconds that is one of her three school records.</p>
        <p>''I wish I could run that fast again,'' Annemarie said.</p>
        <p>Her father, John, died of brain cancer 13 years ago, and Deirdre lost her husband to leukemia seven weeks after their marriage. She looked at her older sister and said, ''We're lucky she's come this far.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, at North Salem High, there is an award given every year to the most courageous female athlete. It is called the Annemarie O'Sullivan Award.</p>
        <p>FOR THE RECORD</p>
