        <p>VISITORS to the Olympics who need an antidote to the events and the crowds can spend a few hours wandering along Queen Street in Woollahra. The quiet, tree-lined area is filled with antiques stores and a few smart restaurants. Much of Sydney has become overwhelmed with new building and brash architecture, but Woollahra, one of the early settlements of the colonial city, has retained its original terrace houses, shady trees and village atmosphere.</p>
        <p>In the last decade, Queen Street, the main thoroughfare of Woollahra, about 10 minutes by car or bus from the city center, has become the fashionable antiques haunt for Sydney's new wealthy, their decorators and connoisseurs. A showcase, the street is not a place for bargains, although by American standards the prices are fair and quite bearable. The emphasis is on English and European furniture, silver, jewelry and porcelain, although interest in Australiana surfaces from time to time. Sydney people tend to be enthusiastic about Australian painters, particularly their renditions of the outback landscape, but less so about early colonial furniture.</p>

        <p>VISITORS to the Olympics who need an antidote to the events and the crowds can spend a few hours wandering along Queen Street in Woollahra. The quiet, tree-lined area is filled with antiques stores and a few smart restaurants. Much of Sydney has become overwhelmed with new building and brash architecture, but Woollahra, one of the early settlements of the colonial city, has retained its original terrace houses, shady trees and village atmosphere.</p>
        <p>In the last decade, Queen Street, the main thoroughfare of Woollahra, about 10 minutes by car or bus from the city center, has become the fashionable antiques haunt for Sydney's new wealthy, their decorators and connoisseurs. A showcase, the street is not a place for bargains, although by American standards the prices are fair and quite bearable. The emphasis is on English and European furniture, silver, jewelry and porcelain, although interest in Australiana surfaces from time to time. Sydney people tend to be enthusiastic about Australian painters, particularly their renditions of the outback landscape, but less so about early colonial furniture.</p>
        <p>The storekeepers on Queen Street are friendly and knowledgeable. Many live on the surrounding streets of Woollahra or in neighboring Paddington, another area dominated by 19th-century terrace houses with its own array of galleries. Habitues of Queen Street are eager to retain the ambience of small shops, which include an old-fashioned butcher and a fruit and vegetable store nestled among the windows that glisten with burnished cherry-wood desks, sparkling silver, handsome porcelain and Art Nouveau jewelry. So far Queen Street, unlike Kings Road in London, has not been invaded by brand name clothing stores and music outlets.</p>
        <p>One way to tackle a buying or browsing excursion would be to start at the top where  bustling four-lane Oxford Street gives way to peaceful Queen Street. Almost immediately on your left, you will find the Charles Hewitt Gallery, a source of antique prints and a haven for contemporary Australian artists and photographers. Mr. Hewitt, who is also a specialist in period and modern  picture framing and furniture, prides himself on showing up-and-coming Australian artists as well as established painters. During the Olympic period, he has chosen two Australian artists: Jacqui Comer, whose semi-abstract canvases focus on aerial views of the Australian landscape, and David Naseby, who interprets the Australian outback in bold, stark colors and forms. And his stockroom is filled with the work of other Australian artists, including Tim Snowdon's evocative still-life paintings.</p>
        <p>A few doors farther along the street is Anne Schofield Antiques, a boutique with a fine collection of antique jewelry from the Georgian period to the 1920's and 30's. Ms. Schofield, who has been in business since the late 1960's, is known as the doyenne of her field in Australia. Glamorously adorned with some of her jewelry, she presides behind the glass counters, happily explaining the finer points of a string of Tahitian pearls or the clarity of the diamonds in a 30's Cartier bracelet. The store itself is a bijou: a small room in the colors of the jewels and crowned by a pair of enormous crystal chandeliers from Czechoslovakia. A serious dealer, Ms. Schofield's inventory ranges from the spectacular (an 1850 English diamond necklace for $70,000) to the decorative (Indian gold disc earrings for $700) and a few less expensive bracelets and lockets, at $1.72 Australian to the U.S. dollar.</p>
        <p>On the opposite side of Queen Street, you will find G. L. Auchinachie &amp; Son, where Ian and Gina Auchinachie are the second generation to run the family antiques business. Here, the range is enormous, in both price  and style. The Auchinachies specialize in early English furniture, and will sell you a set of eight mahogany Sheraton dining room chairs that costs $27,000. Or they will gladly sell a piece of Victorian needlework for $60. They have a stock of English country chairs with rush seats and oak dressers. They ship to the United States.</p>
        <p>Toward the center of Queen Street is the charming Michael A. Greene Antiques, where a trove of more reasonably priced and carefully selected jewelry, silver and porcelain is displayed in easy-to-see cases. The owners, Michael and Victoria Greene, know and love their wares, most of which are small and easy to pack. Sometimes, one will spot a coveted item such as a crocodile-leather traveling toiletry trunk fitted with the original glass bottles and containers. Always on hand: sterling silver napkin rings, candlesticks and boxes. The jewelry case abounds in affordable pins, lockets and bracelets. The shop also specializes in the 1920's and 30's ceramics of the English designer Clarice Cliff.</p>
        <p>For antique books, McCormick's is known in Sydney as a top-of-the-line dealer in colonial manuscripts and books on the early voyages to Australia. This upstairs shop also deals in prints, maps and period black-and-white photographs. If the prices are a bit out of bounds, this is still a marvelous place to browse carefully among rare volumes.</p>
        <p>A favorite of decorators is Hamish Clark Antiques, where there is an eclectic mix of 18th-  and 19th-century English furniture, porcelain, desk-top bowls and boxes, and quilts.</p>
        <p>Queen Street is not just antiques.  Cose, a small store in the courtyard of Queens Court, is loaded with designer glassware and china from Italy and France as well as unusual, finely made French leather handbags and latest-look faux jewelry. Almost next door in the courtyard is Leslie McKay Books, one of the best book stores in Sydney, with a good stock of Australia's current generation of fiction writers.</p>
        <p>A stroll through Queen Street would not be complete without stopping for fuel. Caffe Agostinis in the Queen Street courtyard -- you cannot miss it because the tables with wide canvas umbrellas spill outdoors -- is an informal spot with fresh ingredients and reasonable prices. The owner, Margie Agostini (blond hair, white chef's jacket) is usually in attendance in the open kitchen. She serves a great salad of arugula,  asparagus and avocado at lunch for $6.15, and heartier fare in the evening: seafood, veal and chicken dishes at about $11.50 (plus 10 percent tax). No alcohol is served but you can buy a bottle of wine at the Woollahra Hotel across the street.</p>
        <p>Another pleasant restaurant is  Bistro Moncur, where the noise level is fashionably intense, with a clientele from the neighborhood. As everywhere in Sydney, the fish is fresh, and there is steak as well. Prices for a main course are $13 to $17.</p>
        <p>To finish off the shopping expedition, you can sink into a comfortable chair or perch on a stool at the Woollahra Hotel, on the corner of Queen and Moncur Streets. This traditional Australian pub has been done over with sleek wood floors and handsome furniture. To celebrate your good buys, a bottle of Australian Petaluma Crozer champagne will be about $18.</p>
        <p>Where to linger</p>
        <p>A new 10 percent sales tax on goods and services went into effect July 1. Purchases in one place of $300 or more in Australian funds (about $175 U.S.) qualify for a refund of the tax.</p>
