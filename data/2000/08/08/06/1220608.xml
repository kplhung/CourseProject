        <p>If you drop a dollar bill on the sidewalk and do not pick it up quickly, it is safe to say you have lost your rights to it. If your sailing ship drops into the sea, though, is it still yours?</p>
        <p>Until now, probably not. But the idea of finding and salvaging lost treasure just got a nasty legal jolt.</p>
        <p>In its years of conquering parts of the world, Spain left many a ship on the ocean floor, often laden with riches, and these provided juicy targets for adventurers. But with technology making salvaging easier these days, Spain and other countries want to reclaim these scraps of heritage -- and loot. And a federal appeals court in Virginia has now ruled that two ships sunk off that state's coast still, centuries later, belong to Spain.</p>
        <p>Treasure hunters are not happy, and the one who found those two ships is weighing an appeal.</p>
        <p>But if the ruling stands, it could mean, say, that the British could lay claim to the superstar of wrecks, the Titanic. On the other hand, it could also raise trickier issues. After all, much of that Spanish loot was first stolen from Latin American natives. Who has the prior claim now?</p>
