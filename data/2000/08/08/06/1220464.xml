        <p>Say what you will about Senator Robert G. Torricelli, the Man Who Would Be King, but the guy sure knows how to keep politics interesting.</p>
        <p>There we were, languishing in the campaign doldrums of summer, when Mr. Torricelli had the audacity to start a political knife fight with fellow Democrats by challenging the party's anointed contender for governor in 2001. Then, just as Republicans were busy lulling the nation to sleep with their 100-Percent Issue-Free convention, the New Jersey Democrats brought their death match to its nasty conclusion, leaving Mr. Torricelli's entrails strewn about the ring.</p>
        <p>In a race for endorsements from Democratic political bosses, Mr. Torricelli was outflanked by Jim McGreevey, the mayor of Woodbridge. When Mr. Torricelli withdrew from the race on Monday, his downfall was so sudden and humbling that many Democrats declared him an orphan in his own party. Some McGreevey supporters even went so far as to predict that Mr. Torricelli might decide not to run for re-election in 2002.</p>
        <p>But anyone who believes that Mr. Torricelli's loss will somehow suppress his appetite for political wrangling doesn't understand the man's life story. And if any McGreevey supporter truly believes that senator's political career is nearing an end, they are making the same mistake Mr. Torricelli himself made when he entered the governors race: underestimating the opponent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Torricelli has been in politics since high school, and he has repeatedly proven himself a master of the game. He is a shrewd strategist, a skilled orator and a voracious fundraiser. Although he has made plenty of enemies in his own party, consider this astounding fact: Mr. Torricelli is so charming that even a Republican, the former Bergen County Republican chairman, Berek Don, admits breaking the law to give him more money.</p>
        <p>So rather than preparing for Mr. Torricelli's exit from the stage, most political observers say they fully expect him to rebound.</p>
        <p>''There's no doubt that this is a setback in the short term,'' said Cliff Zukin, a public policy professor at Rutgers. ''But I suspect that someone of Bob Torricelli's stature and talent will recover relatively quickly.''</p>
        <p>Before considering what path's Mr. Torricelli might pursue to rehabilitate his political fortunes, it's only fitting to examine what New Jersey's political scene might have looked like under the reign of Governor Torricelli.</p>
        <p>He promised to pursue several bold initiatives: A statewide day-care system, prescription drug benefits to the middle class and an expanded public school system that would offer classes for 4-year-olds. He also said his leadership would offer an example to the nation, a statement many Torricelli-watchers interpreted as sign of his ambition to one day run for president.</p>
        <p>Beyond mere policy, Mr. Torricelli would have brought a different style to Trenton, particularly its unglamorous nightlife. Among the Washington glitterati, he is one of Capitol Hill's legendary Lotharios, a bachelor who is frequently mentioned in gossip columns because he has dated Bianca Jagger and Patricia Duff.</p>
        <p>In Trenton, city of wallflowers, it might take a bit of creativity to fill his social calendar. But hey, why hold the Miss America Pageant in Atlantic City every year when the State House is available, and the governor's mansion (surely the state's most impressive, taxpayer-financed bachelor pad) is just minutes away?</p>
        <p>And now that state troopers are forbidden from engaging in racial profiling, why not focus traffic enforcement efforts on blondes. (Sorry ma'am, you were going 67 in a 65 zone. You're going to have to meet the governor for drinks.)</p>
        <p>With the tantalizing possibilities of the governor's office now temporarily out of reach, Mr. Torricelli said his first task would be to focus on his duties as the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which is helping to coordinate the party's 32 Senate campaigns in  November. Then he plans to run for re-election in 2002.</p>
        <p>Some New Jersey Democrats fear that Mr. Torricelli's image may be tarnished by the federal investigation surrounding his 1996 campaign, which has lead to guilty pleas by six donors. But prosecutors have not produced evidence that the senator himself was involved in any wrongdoing, and Mr. Torricelli's aides are confident he will emerge unscathed.</p>
        <p>So if Democrats retake the Senate this fall, which is not unthinkable, Mr. Torricelli will get much of the credit and a leadership position in the majority party. Even if the Republicans retain control of Congress and capture the White House as well, Mr. Torricelli will most likely have a high-visibility role. His quick mind and eloquence have already made him a regular on the Sunday talk show circuit, so he would probably emerge as a top opposition leader.</p>
        <p>It will be a bit trickier for Mr. Torricelli to mend his ties with New Jersey Democratic establishment in time for his 2002 run, but the fact is that both sides need each other.</p>
        <p>Mr. McGreevey needs a united party when the governor's race begins in earnest next year and is likely to seek Mr. Torricelli's endorsement. The Democratic county chairmen who turned their backs on him in the past few weeks can also be won over. New Jersey Democrats have been cash-starved for years, and can always use the help of someone with Mr. Torricelli's fund-raising skills.</p>
        <p>And if Mr. McGreevey loses, guess who gets to tell his fellow Democrats, ''I told you so.''</p>
