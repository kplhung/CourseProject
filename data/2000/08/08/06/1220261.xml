        <p>Some places play such a crucial role in your life that if you return, memories from previous stays force themselves through you, triggered by the simplest mnemonic.

        <p>And I remember promising my two teenage sons when we went to Paris for the first time, four years ago, that every bite of food we would encounter would be a revelation, because that was the effect the food had on my as-yet-un-Julia'd taste buds during my first visit in the mid-60's -- all those sauces, unheard of in America!

        <p>Some places play such a crucial role in your life that if you return, memories from previous stays force themselves through you, triggered by the simplest mnemonic. I don't remember a thing that happened in Lincoln, Neb., where I spent a week, nor a single person I met in Cologne. But I remember on my third or fourth visit to Paris running into my cousin at lunch in Montmartre and realizing that I had been in love with her for about 25 years. Fortunately, her husband, whom she loved, was with her.</p>
        <p>And I remember promising my two teenage sons when we went to Paris for the first time, four years ago, that every bite of food we would encounter would be a revelation, because that was the effect the food had on my as-yet-un-Julia'd taste buds during my first visit in the mid-60's -- all those sauces, unheard of in America! But this was '96, and the French influence on American cuisine was no longer news. After a couple of days, both boys responded -- not for the first time -- with ''Hyperbole, Dad'' written across their eyeballs.</p>
        <p>My first visit was striking for more than the food, however. Paris's reputation as the most romantic of cities asserted itself in contradictory ways because my father hit on my girlfriend.</p>
        <p>I didn't really blame him. He was bored, and Anna was very beautiful, wonderfully well spoken, being an actress (sort of a Brit squared), and as brilliantly intimidating as women with English accents continue to be to American men.</p>
        <p>She and I were on a spring break from the acting school in London I was attending partly because I loved the theater and partly because there was a war going on that I didn't want to attend. I had recently concluded that the war was unconscionable, thereby conveniently reinforcing my self-interest with morality, not for the last time.</p>
        <p>Anna and I found floor space in someone's cluttered apartment near the Bois de Boulogne. We tussled with the metro, braved the open-air elevator on the Eiffel Tower, clinging to each other in terror (never again), and took pleasure in discovering the very thin slice of ham inside the thick, buttered baguette from the corner brasserie, which exemplified for me the difference between French and American sensibilities: at home, the sandwich would have been reversed -- pounds of meat and mayo, overstuffed between thin slices of Wonder Bread.</p>
        <p>After two days, Dad phoned. I don't remember how he found me -- or why, since in the 22 years following my birth I hadn't seen him for more than 15 days, he and Mother having furiously divorced right at the end of the war that made his generation the Greatest. He stayed in the Southwest and frequently saw his first son, and Mother reared my sister and me in New York. I do remember that he, a self-proclaimed hick from Fort Worth who exaggerated his childhood poverty so as to make his substantial, self-made adult wealth all the more mythic, was quite impressed that I was going to school in London, though I don't think he focused much on the kind of school it was.</p>
        <p>Dad's lifelong M.O. was to mix business with pleasure -- that way, he could deduct both. He was a flamboyantly excessive devourer of failing newspapers, radio stations, highway billboards, real estate, food, women, the air we breathe -- and the latest, trendiest possession. The movie ''Goldfinger'' was the rage then, and so, between visiting a handful of newsprint suppliers for his burgeoning publishing empire out West, he also spent a few days in London picking up an Aston Martin. Never mind that, short, fat, middle-aged and 94 percent bald, he looked more like Pokemon than James Bond, Dad wanted that car. He decided to drive it around Europe accumulating the 1,500 miles or so required to beat the import duty back into the States. Never mind that touring and hotelling around Europe would be more expensive than just paying the tariff. Dad loved America, and nothing gave him more pleasure than working it for all its worth.</p>
        <p>''Where'd you like to have dinner?'' he growled into the phone. ''Gigi'' was the sum of my French-restaurant knowledge, so I suggested Maxim's, the wildly expensive museum of haute cuisine featured in the film. Because I didn't know him at all, I expected him to counter with a neighborhood cafe featuring hard-boiled eggs and unlabeled wine on the table. ''Fine, see you at 9,'' he said, always happy to be generous when it was his call.</p>
        <p>Anna and I got as gussied up as grad students could and were soon seduced not only by the food at Maxim's but also by the belle epoque decor. I don't think any men wore white tie nor the women ball gowns, but they might as well have. It truly was like eating in a theatrical set, surrounded by dozens of Colettes and Chevaliers. I remember having duck  l'orange, since it was one of the few things I had heard of, and following it with crepes suzettes, not realizing that sweetened O.J. was the dominant flavor of both. Dad had something with beef in it, Anna a lobster thermidor with a sauce so viscous that two George Foremans couldn't have finished it. There was sauce on everything, all inspissated with butter, flour, creme frache. To me, it was all the hautest of haute, and delicious. Dad was charming and funny, filled with war stories of his rambunctious life.</p>
        <p>Anna and I talked of drama school, which bored him, and since we didn't have business in common, he eventually got antsy. As the sugary O.J. kicked in, I headed for the W.C. and returned a few minutes later to find Anna with quite a curious look on her face.</p>
        <p>Dad wanted to go, so we all said good night. We thanked him profusely, and he hurried off into the night. On the long, raggedy ride on the metro back to the Bois de Boulogne -- quite the contrast to Maxim's -- I found out why Anna had looked so stunned.</p>
        <p>''Your father asked me to go back to Las Vegas with him,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''He did?'' I didn't know whether to be shocked or angered or flattered -- after all, I had finally done something he approved of so strongly that he wanted it for himself. ''What did you say?''</p>
        <p>''I said: 'No, Mr. Reynolds, I don't think that would be proper. I'm in love with your son.' That stopped him, and he behaved like a perfect gentleman. 'Of course, dear, of course,' he said, and asked me about acting.''</p>
        <p>It stopped me, too, because Anna also hadn't told me that. I wondered if she meant it or if it was just a way to check Dad's proposition. In any case, Paris had suddenly become surprisingly romantic for all three of us.</p>
        <p>''Are all you Yanks like that?'' she asked, amused. ''Yes!'' I said. ''Come back to Las Vegas with me!'' She laughed, and we climbed the steps to our high-rise. Two or three months later we broke up, and I heard many years later that she had been married once or twice. My father died in 1993.</p>
        <p>On my most recent visit to Paris, in May, I saw no duck  l'orange on any menus. Instead, I found a delectable -- and, needless to say, lighter -- pissaladi re, a thin pastry lightly brushed with cr me frache, caraway and shredded duck at the quite glorious Plaza-Athenee, where Alain Ducasse will set up shop in the fall. There was much laughter, which I'm sure will become a memory for future visits. But not like the first.</p>
        <p>I don't plan to take my sons to Maxim's, with or without their girlfriends. On the other hand, maybe I will, because in some areas at least, I know better than Dad did.</p>
        <p>But every time I have been to Paris, and at just about every meal I have eaten there, the image of my old man making a pass at my girlfriend refreshes itself in my memory. And despite his ill-placed lechery, I picture him, adventurous, optimistic, unbridled, squoze behind the wheel of what was at the time the hottest (and possibly smallest) car in the world, grinning madly, mindless of his appearance and what rules he broke, zipping around Europe courtesy of U.S. Customs. Could he do this and still not get a crown? Tut, were it further off, he'd pluck it down!</p>
        <p>Pissaladi re au Confit de Canard  (Adapted from Le Relais Plaza at the Plaza-Athenee)  For the confit:  4 whole duck legs</p>
        <p>1/2 cup kosher salt  1 1/2 teaspoons whole peppercorns  3 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed  3 sprigs fresh thyme  1 1/2 to 2 cups duck fat</p>
        <p>For the shortcrust pastry:  2 cups all-purpose flour</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon salt  2 sticks unsalted butter, cut into</p>
        <p>1/2-inch cubes  1 egg  3 to 5 tablespoons cold water</p>
        <p>For the toppings:  8 ounces fromage blanc</p>
        <p>1/2 cup cr me frache</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground  black pepper  2 Vidalia or other sweet onions, peeled and sliced into paper-thin rings  1 teaspoon caraway seeds  18 walnut halves.</p>
        <p>1. To make the confit: Seal the duck, salt, peppercorns, garlic and thyme in a zip-top plastic bag. Refrigerate for 12 hours. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees. Remove and reserve the peppercorns, garlic and thyme. Rinse the salt off the duck. Place the reserved seasonings and the duck in a deep casserole so that the legs fit together nicely. Cover with duck fat. Bake until a skewer inserted in the leg slides in and out easily, about 3 hours. Cool the casserole on a rack to room temperature. Refrigerate until the confit is needed, up to 1 week.</p>
        <p>2. To make the pastry: In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt and mix well. Add the butter and cut in with a pastry blender or your fingers until crumbly. In a small bowl, beat the egg with 3 tablespoons of the water and sprinkle over the flour mixture. Toss with a fork until moistened. Drizzle in remaining water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the mixture holds together. Divide the dough into 6 equal portions and shape each into a disk. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.</p>
        <p>3. To make the pissaladi re: Preheat a pizza stone in a 500-degree oven. Drain the fromage blanc in a cheesecloth-lined sieve for at least 2 hours, squeezing out the liquid; place in a bowl with the cr me frache, nutmeg, salt and pepper and mix well. Remove the duck from the fat and pull the meat into thin shreds. On a floured surface, roll each disk of pastry into a thin round and trim the edges using a plate as a guide. Spread with the cheese mixture, dividing it evenly. Top with the onions, caraway seeds and duck, dividing them evenly. Crumble 3 walnut halves over each round and bake 3 at a time until crisp on the bottom, 3 to 5 minutes.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 servings.</p>
