        <p>RISING on a high tide of economic good times for Long Island, the generously proportioned, traditionally middle-income hamlet of West Islip on Suffolk County's South Shore has experienced an upward surge in housing prices that surprises veteran real estate professionals.</p>
        <p>As surprising, they said, was how quickly homes listed for sale moved in this community of single-family Cape Cods, split-levels, colonials and ranches.</p>

        <p>RISING on a high tide of economic good times for Long Island, the generously proportioned, traditionally middle-income hamlet of West Islip on Suffolk County's South Shore has experienced an upward surge in housing prices that surprises veteran real estate professionals.</p>
        <p>As surprising, they said, was how quickly homes listed for sale moved in this community of single-family Cape Cods, split-levels, colonials and ranches.</p>
        <p>''Everything is up, across the board,'' said Geoffrey S. Matherson, the owner of a real estate agency in West Islip that bears his name. ''But anyone who puts a sign on the lawn sells very quickly.''</p>
        <p>With its wide range in prices -- from more than $1 million for prime waterfront locations on or near Great South Bay to less than $200,000 in well-inland neighborhoods north of Sunrise Highway -- the community caters to a broad range of buyers, including young families priced out of more expensive but in other ways similar South Shore communities a few miles west in Nassau County.</p>
        <p>Many new buyers come to West Islip, brokers and residents said, because of highly regarded local public schools. The school district line largely defines unincorporated West Islip, giving shape and form to an area without a downtown or identifiable center.</p>
        <p>Lately, West Islip has had attention as the boyhood home of Representative Rick A. Lazio, the Republican candidate for United States Senate. Mr. Lazio, who speaks in campaign advertisements of his deep New York roots and lazy schoolboy days clamming on the bay, grew up on a quiet street south of Montauk Highway in a modest Cape, where his mother, Olive, still lives.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, a 1976 graduate of West Islip High School, returned there in June to deliver the commencement address to the class of 2000. ''He's a hometown boy, and he has always been very concerned about this community,'' said Nancy Donohue, a West Islip resident for 27 years and the president of the West Islip Symphony Orchestra.</p>
        <p>The 50-member orchestra holds three major concerts a year. Tickets are $5.</p>
        <p>For others, it is what lies near but not in West Islip that adds much of the hometown feeling. The hamlet has a convenient entrance onto the Robert Moses Causeway, and ocean beaches and fishing are minutes away.</p>
        <p>Getting to the city is not quite so simple. Without a railroad station of their own, city-bound West Islip commuters must drive about 10 minutes west to Babylon village, where an assortment of private lots provide parking.</p>
        <p>''We have a lot of wives that run their husbands to the train,'' said Carl W. Riese, president and owner of Segal-Riese Realtors in West Islip.</p>
        <p>Major shopping is a 10-minute drive away at the 1.3-million-square-foot Sunrise Mall in East Massapequa and the 846,000-square-foot South Shore Mall in Bay Shore. There are also stores and restaurants locally along Montauk Highway, Union Boulevard and Sunrise Highway.</p>
        <p>In an indication of rising real estate prices that some brokers said were just now leveling off, a three-bedroom, one-bath ranch in the Concord Village neighborhood recently sold for $225,000. Houses there frequently sold for less than $200,000 a few years ago.</p>
        <p>HOUSE rentals, when they can be found, are also getting more expensive. A three-bedroom, one-bath house recently rented for $1,700 a month. Rents are lower at the 15-unit Keith Garden Apartments, the hamlet's only rental complex, where two-bedroom units are about $900 a month. But there are no vacancies, Mr. Matherson said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Matherson said there were also no vacancies at the hamlet's two condominium complexes. They are the 15-unit Sunrise Garden, where a two-bedroom unit sold for $160,000 in March 1999, and the recently completed South Country Estates, with 14 two-bedroom town houses that sold for about $250,000.</p>
        <p>People tend to stay, and children come back. Virginia Bonfiglio, whose parents moved to West Islip from Queens in the early 1950's, now lives down the street from them and not far from her grown daughter. ''That's three generations in a two-block radius,'' she said.</p>
        <p>So many young families have moved here in recent years that the 5,800-student West Islip Union Free School District will reopen  an elementary school in September, bringing the number to six. The high school had 307 graduates in the class of 2000, more than 90 percent of whom are going on to college, but enrollment in the bulging sixth grade exceeds 500.</p>
        <p>In March 1999, district residents approved a whopping $52.9 million bond issue for more classrooms and renovations to all schools and the reopening of the Captree elementary school. There are two middle schools for grades six through eight.</p>
        <p>Nearly 70 percent of June graduates earned Regents diplomas. Thirty-seven graduates scored more than 1,300 on the College Board examinations. Class averages of 497 in verbal and 507 in math were slightly above the state averages.</p>
        <p>The high school offers advanced placement courses and extensive opportunities to use computers and is one of the few schools on Long Island to teach introductory Chinese. There is a specially designed classroom for students with special needs, half of whom are from outside the district. A partnership with Good Samaritan Hospital Medical Center, which is in West Islip, teams students with medical professionals. A new global communications center is scheduled to open this fall.</p>
        <p>THE center will employ computers, a satellite dish and Internet hookups to allow language students to tap directly into other cultures for audio and visual material -- newscasts, for example, or virtual tours of the Louvre given in French. Students will also be able to converse in real time with students in other countries. The classroom teacher will have computer capability to track students individually and send messages that appear on their monitors. The district said Mr. Lazio obtained the $176,000 federal grant to finance the center.</p>
        <p>West Islip is also the home of St. John the Baptist diocesan high school, which draws 1,000 students in grades 9 through 12 from many parts of Long Island. Almost all of the 238 graduates in the Roman Catholic school's class of 2000 plan to go to college. Tuition is $4,375 a year for all students.</p>
        <p>The school has a range of programs for its students, including the academically gifted and those with learning disabilities. An advanced placement program allows students to earn 32 college credits through St. John's University and New York Institute of Technology.</p>
        <p>Boys' soccer teams have been standouts in the school's full athletic program, winning a national high school championship four years ago and league championships in two of the last three years.</p>
        <p>There are five computer labs and all classrooms are linked to a school computer network. Internet use is integrated into course instruction. Students in the communications program produce a 22-minute program each weekday entitled ''Good Morning St. John's'' that is shown on the school's closed-circuit television system. The school also has an AM and and FM radio station.</p>
        <p>THE school strives to create a Catholic community atmosphere. Non-Catholic students, whose numbers have been rising, make up less than 5 percent of the student body.</p>
        <p>Students are required to wear blazers, dress shoes, oxford shirts and, for boys, ties. Hair cannot be too long, too short or faddish, and earrings are prohibited for boys, who must also be close-shaved. ''If a major corporation does not allow orange hair, a goatee and five earrings, we don't allow it either,'' said the Rev. Jim Vlaun, the school chaplain.</p>
        <p>A Catholic elementary school, Our Lady of Lourdes, has 375 students in prekindergarten through the eighth grade. Tuition for the half-day prekindergarten classes is $85 a month, rising to $200 a month for kindergarten through the eighth grade. Nonparishioners pay $25 a month more.</p>
        <p>The Town of Islip's 14.5-acre Casamento Park, the largest outdoor recreation area in West Islip, has ball fields, a picnic spot and courts for tennis, basketball and handball. Season permits for the park's swimming pool complex, which is opened from mid-June to Labor Day, are $125 for a family and $80 for an individual.</p>
        <p>There are 134 boat slips, and a two-year waiting list, at the Town of Islip's beach and marina. The docking fee is $34 a foot. There is also a boat ramp.</p>
        <p>The original inhabitants of the area, the Secatogue Indians, lived along the bay and on Sumpwams Creek and what is now called  Willetts Creek. They sold the land to Thomas and William Willetts in 1692. The area remained a fishing and farming enclave until wealthy estate owners arrived more than a century later.</p>
        <p>By the mid-1800's, the railroad had arrived in nearby Babylon, and lumber and charcoal industries were prospering. Ukrainians arrived early in the 20th century, and by 1930 there were 734 residents.</p>
        <p>The eastward-rolling suburbanization of Long Island struck in the early 1950's and peaked by the early 1970's, the 20-year period in which most homes were built. The population by 1970 was slightly higher than it is today.</p>
        <p>But school enrollment hints that new peaks may lie ahead. ''We are experiencing a population boom here,'' said Nancy M. Lenz, a school district spokeswoman.</p>
