        <p>BOSS CUPID</p>
        <p>By Thom Gunn.</p>
        <p>111 pp. New York: Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux. $22.</p>
        <p>Alternate titles for Thom Gunn's new collection, his 12th: Boss Age. Boss Loss. Still Horny After All These Years. For if Cupid rules these pages, he does so jointly with Father Time. The Oxbridge boy who came to San Francisco in the 1950's and fell in love with the America of Brando and Dean, and with the young toughs who aped them, is 70 now. His fires still burn amazingly hot -- here a biker's ''golden crotch'' provokes his lust, there a barman's pointing nipples -- but he can't help seeing his lust ironically now, as an ''old man's greed for youth.'' He worries about arousing his young lovers' pity, or their cruelty; complains of high blood pressure; sings epithalamiums for others' weddings; sneers nervously at younger poets and contemplates the last days of dead ones.</p>
        <p>Though Gunn is celebrated as a formalist, his formalism differs from that of poets like Auden or Elizabeth Bishop, to the first of whom he is sometimes compared. Whereas they often chose to work within the prescriptions of traditional forms -- sonnet, sestina, villanelle -- self-consciously ''dancing in chains,'' in Nietzsche's phrase, Gunn allows his patterns of meter, rhyme and stanzaic form to emerge organically from the material to which he is seeking to give shape. One can almost follow this happening on the page, observation finding its proper rhythm, emotion its spiritual level, the poet discovering new moods, new modes of reflection. Rhymed couplets drive headlong:</p>
        <p>That almost envious sexual tension which</p>
        <p>Rubbing at made the greater, like an itch,</p>
        <p>An itch to steal or otherwise possess</p>
        <p>The brilliant restive charm, the boyishness.</p>
        <p>Quatrains suggest emotional distance and the recursive nature of reflection, as in this memory of a one-night stand:</p>
        <p>I gazed at moonrise over the wide streets,</p>
        <p>A movie letting out, a crowd's dilations,</p>
        <p>Bars, clocks, the moon ironic at her stations:</p>
        <p>By these the window paragraphed our feats.</p>
        <p>Short, irregular lines convey a jotted immediacy:</p>
        <p>Could never place him.</p>
        <p>But I'd go into</p>
        <p>BAR on 2nd Avenue</p>
        <p>and there he was, face</p>
        <p>lighting up, helpful</p>
        <p>silly and eager, yes.</p>
        <p>This last passage points to another reason it is misleading, if accurate, to call Gunn a formalist. Formalism suggests classicism, but despite occasional appropriations of Greek myth, Gunn is most certainly not a classicist. Classicism measures the present by the yardstick of the past. What's here and now is ephemeral, significant only when seen in the perspective of eternity. But Gunn -- hedonist, subjectivist, true child of his adoptive land -- sees and values the passing moment for its own sake. Hence the ironically self-minimizing title of the middle section of ''Boss Cupid'' (the only one of the three to carry a title): ''Gossip.'' Those lines about a barfly open the section, a score of wonderfully colloquial sketches of character and scene, chatty and hip but tremendously concise and abounding in little marvels of intonation and observation:</p>
        <p>these sharp chic</p>
        <p>ironic girls</p>
        <p>with brisk hairstyles</p>
        <p>and subtle tattoos.</p>
        <p>Those 11 words conjure up some college students, but most of Gunn's subjects are the bad boys and down-and-outers of San Francisco's gay bar scene: ex-cons, drifters, minor porn stars. ''Gossip'' is brisk in its treatments but profoundly loving in the purity and universality of its sympathy.</p>
        <p>It also comes as a respite after some much more difficult material. The volume's first section records a life lived among ghosts. ''A posthumous poet,'' Gunn calls Robert Duncan in his unproductive last years, but the phrase could as well apply to Gunn himself: a poet in the wake of death, awakened everywhere to forms of loss, giving his dead a decent burial and then getting back talk from them, finding new delight and wondering if he has a right to it. But if the dead arise unbidden -- pack their bodies into my dreams,+. . . eat my feelings'' -- he also courts their resurrection, and with it his own:</p>
        <p>survivor, as I am indeed,</p>
        <p>Recording so that I may later read</p>
        <p>Of what has happened, whether between sheets,</p>
        <p>Or in post offices, or on the streets.</p>
        <p>The loss is cultural as well as human. Gunn, one of the great elegists of the age of AIDS, looks back here to the ''sexual New Jerusalem'' celebrated in ''The Passages of Joy'' (1982) across the ocean of tears traversed in ''The Man With Night Sweats'' (1993). The ''Dionysian experiment,'' a ''community of the carnal heart,'' may never have lasted anyway, Gunn says, but he refuses to renounce it retrospectively, to side against its hopefulness and daring with the ''wisdom'' that even then ''was pointing us away.''</p>
        <p>For Cupid, after all, is boss. The volume concludes with a series of sustained treatments of its titular theme, beginning with Gunn's most remarkable act of imaginative sympathy, a five-part dramatic monologue by that hungriest of lovers, Jeffrey Dahmer. Cannibalism becomes a multidimensional metaphor for what love makes us want to do: penetrate to the organs and secrets that lie beneath the skin, fill our empty-seeming selves with a lover's vitality, make our lovers stay forever, even if we have to kill them. There's grotesque fun here -- love must be ensnared while on the run, / For later it will spoil'' -- but it gets at the heart of what Gunn finds universal about Dahmer's predicament: love's perishability. The last poem finds the speaker before his open fridge, contemplating a face that won't answer back.</p>
        <p>As the book begins with the life journey of a poet, Robert Duncan, it ends with that of one who was both poet and lover, King David. Unsurprisingly in a book named after a deity, both reflect on ''the divine prompting,'' the ''daily ecstasy'' of God. But the David sequence ends piano, with the ''brief bow'' that follows on ''the final leap.'' Is Gunn signaling his intention to bow out after a half-century of making poems? Unlikely: his boss clearly wants him for a few more jobs.</p>
