        <p>For a different type of grunge, there's the pimp-rock of Kid Rock. Ten years ago, Kid Rock was on his way to becoming the next Vanilla Ice. The white rapper's material was sexually graphic, and although it raised eyebrows, it didn't sell records.</p>
        <p>Then something happened. Kid mixed the Detroit hip-hop culture with blue-collar rock, speed metal and twangy country guitars and he came up with a winning combination culminating in a Grammy nomination for ''Devil With a Cause.''</p>

        <p>Kid's roots are all over the place, from Black Sabbath to the alternative Tubes to country legend Hank Williams, and throughout his stomping, hair-flailing, propulsive set, the diverse musical styles gel into one rowdy, profane, self-indulgent party.</p>
        <p>You can be pummeled in two locations: PNC Bank Arts Center, Holmdel, on Friday at 8 p.m.; and at Blockbuster Sony Entertainment Center, Camden, on Aug. 16 at 8 p.m.</p>
