        <p>Fourteen years old and barely 4-foot-6, Amelia Gomez spends her days stooped over, pulling weeds and picking red peppers, often complaining that the pesticides give her rashes.</p>
        <p>Daniel Velasquez, 13, who picks cherry tomatoes nearly 12 hours a day, recently arrived on Virginia's Eastern Shore after a two-day bus ride from Florida's tomato-growing region.</p>
        <p>Jose Arispe, 14, whose migrant family divides the year between Virginia and his native Texas, is so proud of the $160 he earns each week doing farm work that he says he wants to quit school to help his family make ends meet. Some days his 11-year-old brother joins in the picking.</p>
        <p>Amelia, Jose and Daniel are among hundreds of child farm workers on Virginia's Eastern Shore, part of the estimated 150,000 children 16 years or younger who work on the nation's farms, picking fruit and vegetables. For the most part migrants, these children often work 10 to 12 hours a day, six days a week, facing dangers from pesticides and risking exhaustion and dehydration from toiling under the sun.</p>
        <p>These children, many labor experts say, are among a steadily growing group of young field hands and constitute one of the least visible and most vulnerable workers in the nation. Their plight is such that Democrats in Congress are planning to introduce legislation next month to make it harder to hire 12-, 13- and 14-year-olds.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes my fingers start to bleed, and then they start to sting from the poison in the plants,'' said Herman Perez, a 14-year-old tomato picker who, with his older brother, arrived from Guatemala three weeks ago.</p>
        <p>Farm worker advocacy groups say many child farm workers are exploited because they are vulnerable, scared to speak up and desperate to hold onto their jobs and because many are illegal immigrants. They are eager to help their families  or to pay back the smugglers who  sneaked them across the border.</p>
        <p>Child farm workers are often paid less than the $5.15 minimum wage, sometimes receiving $2.50 an hour. Growers often do not provide them with toilets and drinking water, and some child pickers say growers occasionally order them to resume picking even when the 24 hours required by law have not passed after pesticides are sprayed.</p>
        <p>''When people think of agriculture, they think of the agrarian myth and what a wonderful, nurturing, safe, wholesome environment to raise a child,'' said Diane Mull, executive director of the Association of Farm Worker Opportunity Programs. ''In some cases, that's true, but it's certainly not true for migrant farm worker kids. They're often breathing pesticides, they're often not paid the minimum wage and they often end up dropping out of school.''</p>
        <p>Many farmers say children often provide them with fake ID's stating that they are 18. And farmers deny exploiting these children, saying that they do not overwork them and train them in dealing with pesticides.</p>
        <p>In a report in June on child farm workers, Human Rights Watch criticized what it called a double standard in labor laws, noting that children in nonagricultural jobs are not allowed to work more than 40 hours a week but there is no such limit for children doing agricultural work.</p>
        <p>The report criticized laws that do not prohibit 14-year-old farmhands from working 70-hour weeks. Federal laws prohibit children under 18 from doing hazardous work in nonagricultural jobs, but the laws allow 16- and 17-year-olds to do hazardous work on farms.</p>
        <p>''Agricultural employment for kids is bloody dangerous,'' said John Fraser, director of the Department of Labor's wage and hour division, the main agency overseeing child labor laws. ''Only 6 to 7 percent of the jobs that young people take are in agriculture, yet 40 percent of the work-related fatalities that young people suffer are in agriculture.''</p>
        <p>Child farm workers are divided into three groups: unaccompanied migrants, usually teenage illegal immigrants from Mexico or Guatemala; children of migrant farm workers, who often force their teenagers to work and sometimes take children as young as 7 into the fields to pick alongside them; and, last, about 40,000 minors who are the children of farm owners and who start milking cows and harvesting at an early age to learn how to operate the farms that they may someday inherit.</p>
        <p>Thin, shy and soft-spoken, Herman belongs to the fastest growing group of child farm workers, migrants who travel unaccompanied by their parents. At 6:30 each morning, an old school bus takes Herman, his 20-year-old brother and 30 other migrants to a dew-covered tomato field. Herman strains to pull up three-feet-tall weeds that hinder the harvest. Then from 10 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., he picks tomatoes for 40 cents a bucket.</p>
        <p>''I can't pick nearly as fast as the experienced men,'' said Herman, who fills 8 to 10 plastic buckets an hour while others do twice that. At 90 pounds, he struggles to toss the full 20-pound buckets into a truck.</p>
        <p>By dusk, he is exhausted, his fingernails caked with dirt, his fine dark hair matted from sweat. After work, he returns to a labor camp  where he sleeps in a small room with six other migrants. There are two bunk beds and three mattresses are spread on the floor.</p>
        <p>Still, Herman says he has no regrets about leaving his family, his school and his country. ''We're peasants,'' he said, ''and people in Guatemala can't earn much money.''</p>
        <p>His journey to the United States was grueling. After Herman was smuggled into Arizona, the smugglers stuffed him, his brother and 30 others into the back of a truck that carried them to Virginia.</p>
        <p>''It took 48 hours, and we didn't have anything to eat,'' said Herman, who owes the smugglers $1,850. ''It was very hot. There was no water. Some people fainted. We were very weak when we got here.''</p>
        <p>For a recent 60-hour week, he received a $240 check. That translates to $4 an hour, but his managers said he received the minimum wage.</p>
        <p>Social Security and other deductions were taken out, his boss said, but many farm workers wonder if their bosses pocket the deductions.</p>
        <p>Put simply, poverty drives the two largest groups of child farm workers -- those like Herman who come from other countries and those like Jose Arispe, born in Texas but compelled to work because his father makes less than $10,000 a year doing farm work. On average, the adult farm worker earns less than $7,500 a year, partly because many find work for only eight months a year. Their incomes are cut back further because federal laws do not require that farm workers receive time-and-a-half pay when they work more than 40 hours a week.</p>
        <p>Farm workers' advocates say growers are happy to hire these youngsters. But many farmers say they prefer not to hire young workers but are forced to because of a labor shortage.</p>
        <p>''The farmers' view is that workers under age 18 lack maturity and are not particularly productive workers, and they do things that are foolish and dangerous, so you prefer not to have them around the farm,'' said Bryan Little of the American Farm Bureau Federation.</p>
        <p>When the Fair Labor Standards Act was enacted in 1938, it set more lenient standards for children doing farm work than nonagricultural work, largely because farm work was seen as wholesome and family-oriented. Agriculture has changed immensely since then with the advent of huge corporate farms and of a network of more than one million seasonal and migrant workers, many of them teenagers.</p>
        <p>Children's advocacy groups say the laws need to be changed. ''Farm-working juveniles have second-class status -- they enjoy fewer rights than their nonfarm-working peers, and they are exploited while the government looks the other way,'' the Human Rights Watch report said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fraser, of the Labor Department, said the government was increasing its investigations into improper use of child farm workers. Last year it cited 46 farms for violations involving 102 minors. There are 1.9 million farms in the United States.</p>
        <p>The government is spending more for day care centers for young migrant children, and for migrant teenagers, it is financing special education programs, including summer schools, to keep them from dropping out. But all this might not be enough to keep Jose Arispe in school.</p>
        <p>''He wants to quit school,'' said Jose's mother, Elizabeth. ''But I don't think that's a good idea. But he said he needs to work and contribute money to the family.''</p>
