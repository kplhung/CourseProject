        <p>White House aides grumbled today that Gov. George W. Bush's acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention had been presidential -- too presidential, actually, as they accused Mr. Bush of stealing not only President Clinton's ideas, but his words as well.</p>
        <p>In a tone of pique colored with a tinge of glee, the aides said they had come up with nine examples from Mr. Bush's convention speech and other recent speeches that Mr. Clinton had uttered first. The list may be significant chiefly because it shows the Clinton camp's discomfort at Mr. Bush's infiltration of the president's rhetorical territory.</p>

        <p>White House aides grumbled today that Gov. George W. Bush's acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention had been presidential -- too presidential, actually, as they accused Mr. Bush of stealing not only President Clinton's ideas, but his words as well.</p>
        <p>In a tone of pique colored with a tinge of glee, the aides said they had come up with nine examples from Mr. Bush's convention speech and other recent speeches that Mr. Clinton had uttered first. The list may be significant chiefly because it shows the Clinton camp's discomfort at Mr. Bush's infiltration of the president's rhetorical territory.</p>
        <p>''Voters should be wary of someone who tries to portray others' ideas as their own,'' said the White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart.</p>
        <p>The list included these examples:</p>
        <p>''Medicare does more than meet the needs of the elderly; it reflects the values of our society,'' Mr. Bush told cheering delegates.</p>
        <p>''Medicare is more than just a program; it reflects our values,'' Mr. Clinton had said in 1997, remarks recalled this week by White House aides.</p>
        <p>''We will use these good times for great goals,'' Mr. Bush said last week.</p>
        <p>''Let us take our long look ahead and set great goals for our nation,'' Mr. Clinton said during his State of the Union address in January.</p>
        <p>The similar language may be coincidental, but it fits into a strategy on the part of the Bush campaign to blur some of the traditional differences between the parties. The convention reflected that approach as Republicans highlighted a racially diverse cast and studiously steered clear of divisive debate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton has made the appropriation of others' ideas a hallmark of his administration, regularly seizing Republican initiatives that he deems worthy. But that was forgotten today as some of his aides groused about Mr. Bush's ''Clintonian'' text.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lockhart pointed out that Mr. Bush had said during a June 30 campaign stop, ''How a country handles its moment of prosperity and opportunity is just as stern a test of our vision, our judgment, and our character as how we handle adversity.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton utters similar words regularly. ''How a country deals with its prosperity is at least as big a test of its judgment and its character as how a country deals with adversity,'' he said on June 24.</p>
        <p>''Let me assure the president, with all due respect, he is not our model for speechmaking, fund-raising, or conduct in office,'' said Karen P. Hughes, the communications director for the Bush campaign.</p>
        <p>Another spokesman for the Bush campaign, Ray Sullivan, criticized the claim of political plagiarism as ''silly and beneath the dignity of the White House.''</p>
