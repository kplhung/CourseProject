        <p>STUDENTS from two Westchester high schools headed back to school last month to do research on weather and pollen, hoping to forecast the duration and intensity of next year's allergy season.</p>
        <p>Supported by a $10,000 grant from Toyota, 14 students from Lakeland High School in Shrub Oak, which has a popular weather club, and nine students from Fox Lane High School in Bedford, where students have been recording pollen counts, spent five days at Fox Lane learning how to read weather maps, take pollen counts and do long-range forecasting.</p>
        <p>''What we're trying to do is predict the onset, duration and intensity of the allergy season in the spring of 2001,'' said Tim Maloy, who teaches meteorology at Lakeland and runs the 100-member weather club, which broadcasts daily weather forecasts on local radio stations.</p>
        <p>Jon Fiorella, a science teacher at Fox Lane, said, ''Basically, we're in virgin territory.''</p>
        <p>''It's coming together nicely,'' Mr. Fiorella said, surveying the classroom where students peered into microscopes and studied weather data. ''They'll walk out of here with a working knowledge of what they need for this project.''</p>
        <p>The week of lectures and labs began daily at 9 with three hours of meteorology, taught by Mr. Maloy and guests. After lunch Mr. Fiorella took over and taught Mr. Maloy's students about pollen, letting them take the daily pollen counts.</p>
        <p>''Before this, I knew just as much about the weather as your average person,'' said Michael Bueti, a Fox Lane sophomore. ''I learned a lot, and I'm becoming interested in it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fiorella and Mr. Maloy, both cross-country coaches, met more than a decade ago. They would discuss each other's work at Saturday meets and eventually decided to submit a proposal to Toyota, which awards 50 grants of up to $10,000 each year across the country. Their first proposal was rejected two years ago, but they tried again.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fiorella started the school's aeroallergen research club in 1989 and is certified by the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology to collect pollen samples. He sends his monthly data to the Harvard School of Public Health and some 400 local allergists.</p>
        <p>After lunch, three of his students climbed onto Fox Lane's roof and walked over to a machine called the Rotorod Sampler, which collects pollen samples</p>
        <p>Shouhei Yamagami and Michael Bueti, both sophomores, go every day to retrieve samples for analysis.</p>
        <p>The samples were brought back, transferred to slides, stained and given to the Lakeland students.</p>
        <p>After several minutes of searching, Victor Gonzalez, a Lakeland student, looked up from the microscope and said, ''I can't find any.'' Mr. Fiorella attributed that to the previous day's rain, as did Dan Walsh, a senior at Lakeland.</p>
        <p>''Rain obviously does wash the pollen out of the sky,'' he said, adding that higher humidity and winds meant a higher pollen count. The count reached only 3 particles per cubic meter, whereas it can exceed 1,000 in the spring.</p>
        <p>The trickiest part of the project is predicting what the weather will be like next spring, something they hope to do in November, giving allergy sufferers and doctors a heads up.</p>
        <p>Mr. Maloy's students use radar and satellite images for their radio weather reports. ''It takes a while to see what we're in for,'' said Jared Reinstein, a senior, who studies the maps obtained from Web sites every day before making a prediction.</p>
        <p>When school begins again, students at the two schools will collect weather and pollen data until November, when they will formulate their predictions for the allergy season.</p>
        <p>Asked if she thought the group would succeed, Michelle Napolitano, one of the Lakeland students, said enthusiastically, ''It's gonna happen.''</p>
