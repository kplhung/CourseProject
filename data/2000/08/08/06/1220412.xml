        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Herbert Muschamp suggests that city dwellers are a species apart, bound by ''an ethical fiber,'' and that ''the function of a city is to refuse everything less than the best.'' Yet today transportation, communications and the Internet enable even once remote areas to participate in urban life. The claim of superiority for city lovers seems to be a last effort to stake out a territory unsullied by sprawl, commercial culture, the Interstate -- by the fabric of our everyday lives, which, by inference, are unethical, tasteless and less than the best. For me, this position is defensive, self-serving, shallow, elitist and plain wrong-headed.</p>

        <p>Herbert Muschamp suggests that city dwellers are a species apart, bound by ''an ethical fiber,'' and that ''the function of a city is to refuse everything less than the best.'' Yet today transportation, communications and the Internet enable even once remote areas to participate in urban life. The claim of superiority for city lovers seems to be a last effort to stake out a territory unsullied by sprawl, commercial culture, the Interstate -- by the fabric of our everyday lives, which, by inference, are unethical, tasteless and less than the best. For me, this position is defensive, self-serving, shallow, elitist and plain wrong-headed.</p>
        <p>The fashionable architects Mr. Muschamp lauds spend their time morphing used chewing gum shapes into Blah-Blobs, while the reality of the everyday American landscape goes unnoticed. Their one redeeming quality is the descriptive humor of their name -- how can you not like a movement that calls itself Blob Architects? But real innovation would be to engage architecture, urban thought and design with the fabric of everyday life. Instead of sitting in ethical and aesthetic judgment on how the rest of us live, architects should recognize sprawl as a vital form of the contemporary ''city.'' Why can't we work artistically rather than polemically with today's new merging of high and low culture to form a commerce-driven mass culture? Architects' head-in-the-Blob position further marginalizes the profession, disconnecting it from what's vital. Architecture, cities and even sprawl are about life -- it's not the other way round.</p>
