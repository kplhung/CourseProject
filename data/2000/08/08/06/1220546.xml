        <p>The St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center is moving its pediatric emergency and inpatient units 55 blocks north, from 59th Street and 10th Avenue, to 114th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, angering many parents in mid-Manhattan who say they will have to travel too far for care for their children.</p>
        <p>The hospital transferred its emergency room pediatricians last week to 114th Street, at the site of the original St. Luke's Hospital, which merged in 1979 with Roosevelt Hospital on West 59th Street. It plans to move all 33 pediatric beds for inpatient care by next month.</p>

        <p>The St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center is moving its pediatric emergency and inpatient units 55 blocks north, from 59th Street and 10th Avenue, to 114th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, angering many parents in mid-Manhattan who say they will have to travel too far for care for their children.</p>
        <p>The hospital transferred its emergency room pediatricians last week to 114th Street, at the site of the original St. Luke's Hospital, which merged in 1979 with Roosevelt Hospital on West 59th Street. It plans to move all 33 pediatric beds for inpatient care by next month.</p>
        <p>The move mirrors the hospital's shuffling in 1990, when pediatrics and other services were shifted in the reverse direction, from 114th Street to West 59th Street.</p>
        <p>Dr. Sigurd H. Ackerman, the hospital's president and chief executive, said the earlier move had been a mistake because a hospital survey showed that 84 percent of pediatric admissions came from areas north of the Upper West Side.</p>
        <p>The 1990 move was met by protests in Harlem and other poorer neighborhoods traditionally served by St. Luke's. This time, the hospital's decision has upset parents in Clinton and the Upper West Side, who said they might have to travel as far as Lenox Hill or the Village for pediatric care.</p>
        <p>''I have two rambunctious boys,'' said Lori Robinson of the Upper West Side, founder of the New Mommies Network, a support group for new mothers. ''I need to know there is a hospital I can go to quickly.''</p>
        <p>Local elected officials also criticized the hospital.</p>
        <p>''If your mission is to be a full-service health provider, that means every member of the family could go together and get the care they need,'' said City Councilwoman Christine Quinn.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ackerman said doctors trained in general medicine would continue to treat infants or children in the emergency room on West 59th Street. In addition, he said pediatric care would remain for outpatients.</p>
        <p>''We have a first-rate emergency department at the Roosevelt site,'' Dr. Ackerman said. ''Any child that requires emergency care will get it.''</p>
