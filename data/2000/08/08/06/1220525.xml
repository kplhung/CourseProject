        <p>A MERCEDES BENZ brochure of the 1980's described the marque's philosophy thus: A Mercedes should not inspire aggressive driving, but if you find yourself in a bind -- say, roaring into a tight turn too fast -- the car will get you through. That, at least, was the gist. The Mercedes was an automotive Clark Kent, serious and sedate, but ready to fling off its eyeglasses and soar to the rescue.</p>
        <p>There is nothing mild-mannered about the Mercedes-Benz of today. The company boasts of having the fastest sport utility on the road, the ML55, alongside V-12 sedans and luxury hot rods tweaked by AMG, its high-performance-tuning operation. Still, the most advanced Merc of today, the CL500 coupe, seems in many ways an evolution of that previous thinking, not a break with it.</p>

        <p>A MERCEDES BENZ brochure of the 1980's described the marque's philosophy thus: A Mercedes should not inspire aggressive driving, but if you find yourself in a bind -- say, roaring into a tight turn too fast -- the car will get you through. That, at least, was the gist. The Mercedes was an automotive Clark Kent, serious and sedate, but ready to fling off its eyeglasses and soar to the rescue.</p>
        <p>There is nothing mild-mannered about the Mercedes-Benz of today. The company boasts of having the fastest sport utility on the road, the ML55, alongside V-12 sedans and luxury hot rods tweaked by AMG, its high-performance-tuning operation. Still, the most advanced Merc of today, the CL500 coupe, seems in many ways an evolution of that previous thinking, not a break with it.</p>
        <p>Yes, the car is gorgeous, the only true pillarless hardtop in showrooms today; its roofline is a graceful curve and the traditional Mercedes grille is swept back into a long hood. The car that I tested, in ''Almandin black'' with ''light java'' leather, garnered admiring glances on interstates and even on the jaded streets of New York.</p>
        <p>And, yes, it was powerful. Car and Driver magazine found that the 302 horses of the 5-liter V-8 pushed the two-ton chariot to 60 miles an hour in a scant 6.2 seconds, and through a quarter-mile in 14.7 seconds.</p>
        <p>For those who would dare yawn at that, the CL600 is now arriving at dealerships, with a supersophisticated V-12 generating 362 horsepower. In November there will be a CL55, with a souped-up AMG V-8 that makes 355 horsepower. Ergo, the car is striking and fast, and destined to be faster.</p>
        <p>So where's Clark Kent?</p>
        <p>His legacy lives in the CL500's emphasis on intelligence over brawn or beauty. If BMW celebrates driving, and Jaguar promotes sensuality, Mercedes venerates technology -- and its showcase is the CL. My pleasure in guiding the car on winding, rude backroads of the Endless Mountains in Pennsylvania came not from speed or cornering force, though these I tried, but from the way the electronics and engineering anticipated and mastered every maneuver.</p>
        <p>Turn as sharply as you dare, then stomp brutally on the brakes, and the big machine remains almost mystically level and composed. The feat is achieved by sophisticated hydraulic plungers at the four corners that react in split seconds to keep the car unflappably level in disregard of the laws of physics -- there is no dive, no squat, no roll, no wallow, no pitch, no sweat.</p>
        <p>When the paving runs out, a gentle nudge of a button nestled in the burled walnut raises the starship an inch or two above the nasty pebbles. As you accelerate back onto the highway, the car snuggles down again to hug the pavement, ready to negotiate whatever speed you dare.</p>
        <p>Mercedes calls this system ''active body control,'' or ABC, and it comes with ESP (electric stability program) and ASR (automatic slip control). These are only the most impressive of a host of electronic innovations that put the CL500 at the sharpest edge of automotive technology.</p>
        <p>We're not talking here of gizmos that do little besides twinkle little red lights, but of stuff that really is useful, like the ultra-low-profile windshield wipers that go on automatically, and at the right frequency and speed, when they're needed; like the ventilated and heated seats that can be adjusted 14 ways and -- get this -- will give front-seat passengers a pulse massage; like the doors and trunk lid that pull themselves closed; like the five-speed automatic transmission that can figure out how sporty the driver is, or that cedes the shifting to him or her. Not all of this is unique to the CL500, of course, but it's all there in one car, along with an automatic climate control with charcoal filter, auto-dimming mirrors, Xenon headlamps, air bags everywhere and laminated windows that filter infrared rays.</p>
        <p>The driver is not even aware of many touches, like aerodynamics that channel water from the rear window, or the plastic fenders, aluminum hood and roof, and magnesium inner doors that keep the weight far below that of previous big Mercedes coupes.</p>
        <p>To continue in this vein, I should describe how the 10 speakers of the Bose audio system soothe the soul and whatnot, but that would be premature. You do not learn on your first spin, or even on the second, how to manipulate the ''Comand'' system -- the screen and buttons that control the stereo, navigation computer, telephone and probably many other things. Even a dedicated gadget lover will find the centralized controls frustratingly untintuitive. Besides, I wonder if the best of such systems -- like those operated by touching the screen -- is truly safe. The glowing maps, messages and instructions all require looking away from the road for at least a few seconds.</p>
        <p>To be fair, only the Comand system can be accused of being distracting. What is impressive is how unobtusive, intuitive and forgiving the rest of the electronics are. That, I think, is the true link to the Mercedes philosophy of the 80's, the notion that one could put more faith in the car's intelligence than in the driver's. Some of these smarts are discreetly concealed, in the air bags, the air filters, the adaptive transmission. In other matters, the driver can override the automation -- by shifting the gears, turning on the lights, turning off the wipers, switching off the traction control. But in every instance, the CL500 demonstrates what electronics can do -- and what, before long, they may be doing in far lesser cars.</p>
        <p>Let's not pretend the ride is cheap. That terrific back massager is $1,550 extra, and the multicontour seats add $1,050. The rest is standard, and with $1,000 in gas-guzzler tax and $595 for shipping, the CL500 I drove came within $300 of $90,000. (The CL600 is $117,200 plus add-ons; the CL55 will be about $10,000 below that.)</p>
        <p>But then, many electronic features that we take for granted, from engine management to air bags, were exotic extras not so long ago. Traction control, antilock brakes, electronically controlled transmissions have become commonplace in inexpensive cars. So who's to say that a $20,000 sedan won't be giving massages before long?</p>
        <p>More intriguing, where will Mercedes go from here? Next year, the CL is expected to have a cruise control that keeps track of what the car you are following is up to, and that automatically slows down or speeds up to keep you at a safe distance behind.</p>
