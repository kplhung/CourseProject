        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a mesmerized viewer of ''The PTL Club'' in the 1980's, I was pleased to read that the former hostess, Tammy Faye Messner, is now in a film, ''The Eyes of Tammy Faye.'' As much as the documentary may ''reveal a more radical Tammy,'' I think it can never approach the surprising revelations of personality that were displayed for all to see when she and her husband then, Jim Bakker, appeared together. The sheer chutzpah displayed in their ramblings was delightful entertainment. I've always praised the Jim and Tammy act for being funnier than either Burns and Allen or Nichols and May.</p>
