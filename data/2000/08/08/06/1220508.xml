        <p>Hem lengths of lab coats have long conferred status at the hospital, distinguishing medical students (who wear them at the hip) from physicians (who wear them just above the knee). But lately, different cuts have come to signify style status as doctors, particularly those in cosmetic fields like dermatology, become more image-conscious. Some are scrapping the stodgy, boxy polyester lab coat with cheap plastic buttons for custom-made versions with better fits and quirky touches. One doctor had an opera coat copied, another had his name embroidered mechanic-style on the breast.</p>
        <p>Brad Katchen, a cosmetic dermatologist who tends to the skin of Sarah Jessica Parker of ''Sex and the City,'' rejects the antiseptic look, from his wardrobe to his SoHo office, which has Egyptian window shutters for radiator covers and a dupioni silk love seat in the waiting room.

        <p>''If you're a doctor and you spend time picking out your clothes, you don't want to cover them up with any old lab coat,'' Dr. Katchen said. ''You want one that is as well chosen as the clothes that go under it.'' Beneath the lab coat (sold at Vincent Albane, 68, rue Mazarine, for about $55), Dr. Katchen is wearing a navy cashmere V-neck and navy stretch cotton pants from Burberry ($840 and $345). His Chelsea-style boots are by Helmut Lang ($410).</p>
