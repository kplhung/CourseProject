        <p>EIGHTEEN-year-old C.E.O.'s may be tech prodigies, but they do not always chew with their mouths shut. So colleges and universities are offering students instruction in how to avoid embarrassing themselves in front of potential investors or business partners.</p>
        <p>Students at Pace University in Manhattan learn table manners and social skills at ''Smart Manners, Smart Business,'' a seminar held every October. Susquehanna University in Selinsgrove, Pa., teaches juniors and seniors poise and behavior in its ''Power Dining'' program.</p>
        <p>Regional business executives and teachers appear as mystery guests, without name tags. Students must introduce themselves and make appropriate conversation -- no controversial subjects, no off-color jokes.</p>
        <p>Roger Williams University in Bristol, R.I., serves students ''a meal that's a minefield,'' said Patrick Lennahan, director of career services. Among the challenges: ''olives with pits, cherry tomatoes that jump off the plate, chicken on the bone and onion soup with stringy cheese,'' he said. ''They have fun and learn how to butter bread, pass dishes around the table and deal with their napkins.''</p>
        <p>Lehigh University's ''Etiquette and the Arts 101'' covers proper handling of food -do not eat anything hard to swallow at cocktail parties -- as well as how to negotiate the unforgiving world of symphonies, operas and ballets.</p>
        <p>The program, offered at freshman orientation, is a one-hour lecture followed by a concert and dessert reception. Elizabeth Scofield, managing director of the Zoellner Arts Center on Lehigh's Bethlehem, Pa., campus, discusses everything from getting to seats (face the back of the theater when passing others) to viewing paintings (stay at least 18 inches from the art). She also covers the urgent question of what to do when gripped with a terrible coughing fit (leave at once).</p>
        <p>Ms. Scofield, a former advertising executive, said, ''If young men and women hope to be successful in today's business world, they must be able to navigate the arts world without making fools of themselves.''</p>
