        <p>IT was the most difficult time she  had ever endured  worse even than her divorce a few years ago, she said. But now, her battle with former business associates at last ended, Kathleen King is back in her bakery on North Sea Road in Southampton.</p>
        <p>And today is the day she has scheduled for her grand reopening, selling her signature chocolate chip cookies, pies and other baked goods.</p>
        <p>But Ms. King's store will no longer be called Kathleen's Bake Shop, as it was for 18 years. She gave up that name as part of a settlement reached in State Supreme Court last month, in which she and Robert and Kevin Weber, two brothers who were her partners in Kathleen's Bake Shop L.L.C., agreed to divide the corporation's assets and debts. Her enterprise is now called Tate's, in honor of her father, Richard King, known to all in his Southampton farming family as Little 'Tater.</p>
        <p>''My father represents everything to me that the bakery should be about,'' Ms. King said. ''and that the product represents -- especially integrity. And tenacity.''</p>
        <p>Tenacity is certainly something Ms. King, 41, knows all about. At age 11 she began selling home-baked cookies from the family farm on North Sea Road in Noyac. In 1980 she opened her first store just up the road from her current bakery, which she bought in 1982, when she was 23.</p>
        <p>''I put every cent I had into the down payment,'' she said. ''And I had to double my business just to survive.''</p>
        <p>That meant expanding her market beyond the seasonal customers. So Ms. King went into Manhattan with ''a little shopping bag'' filled with her cookies and pies. She asked store owners if they might be willing to carry her products. And they agreed -- stores like Balducci's, Dean &amp; Deluca, Zabar's. She also went up-Island, to Meyer's Farm in Melville and Kitchen Kabaret in Roslyn. ''I even sold to North Shore University Hospital,'' she said, calling the hospital's gift shop in Manhasset one of her best customers.</p>
        <p>The rest, as they say, is history. The bakery -- known then as Kathleen's Bake Shop Inc. -- began to prosper. Ms. King was asked to write a cookbook: Kathleen's Bake Shop Cookbook, published by St. Martin's Press in 1990 and still in print. And her staff grew to 40 employees.</p>
        <p>One of them was Robert Weber, whom Ms. King hired as a bookkeeper in the early 1990's. Over time, Mr. Weber suggested that she expand the business and that he and his brother, Kevin, join her as partners. In 1998 she agreed.</p>
        <p>A new corporation was formed, Kathleen's Bake Shop L.L.C., with Ms. King and the Weber brothers each owning one-third. In return for their two-thirds interest, the brothers agreed to pay her approximately $860,000, in i.o.u.'s.</p>
        <p>The arrangement did not thrive.</p>
        <p>Ms. King said the brothers did not pay her what they owed, attempting instead to use sales receipts to cover the debt and leaving the company with no profit. Bakery workers grew disgruntled, with some saying that their payroll checks had not cleared and that they were being forced to work longer hours, and they joined a union. The Webers countered by establishing a bakery in Virginia and moving much of the company's production there.</p>
        <p>Ms. King said quality suffered while debts accumulated. And there were firings, most notably that of Ms. King herself, who was ousted in February this year from the business she had founded.</p>
        <p>Ms. King sued in State Supreme Court to dissolve the new company and get the money she said was owned to her. The Webers sued back, seeking to prevent her from ending the lease on the Southampton shop. Ms. King's sister-in-law Robin King, who had worked at the bakery before she too was fired, organized picketing outside the bakery every weekend from February to May.</p>
        <p>Jessie Herschell of Hampton Bays was there. She said she was sure she and her fellow picketers, usually between three and six, had had their effect. ''Lots of people turned away from the store after seeing us and talking to us,'' she said.</p>
        <p>In May, the Webers went to federal court to stop the picketing, and a temporary restraining order was issued. But last month Judge Jacob Mishler of the United States District Court threw out the federal case on procedural grounds, and the litigation in State Supreme Court was settled a week later, according to Ms. King's attorney, David Lazer of Melville.</p>
        <p>As part of the settlement, Ms. King took back the Southampton store.</p>
        <p>Calls for comment from the Weber brothers in Virginia were not returned, although their lawyer, Lloyd Feld of Armonk, N.Y., noted last week that ''no one is ever 100 percent happy or 100 percent disappointed'' with a settlement.</p>
        <p>For her part, Ms. King has been working ''day and night,'' re-hiring staff and readying her new bakery for today's planned opening. She is philosophical about the loss of the right to use her name in the business, she said, because trying to ''fix'' the name would have been ''more traumatic than starting over.''</p>
        <p>Ms. King is also convinced that her Tate's products will compare favorably with anything the Virginia Kathleen's may turn out, even though both companies know her recipes (as does anyone who reads her cookbook).</p>
        <p>''Just buy both and put them side by side,'' she said. ''I'm not worried about which you'll prefer.''</p>
        <p>Her friends share her optimism.</p>
        <p>''She's got a reputation here, and the name on the cookies won't matter,'' Ms. Herschell said.</p>
        <p>And what of ''Kathleen's Cookies''?</p>
        <p>''I think that they will go out of business,'' she said.</p>
