        <p>Andrew B. Consovoy, the chairman of the New Jersey Parole Board, under pressure to explain a recently disclosed backlog of cases and under investigation by the state attorney general in connection with favorable treatment for several inmates with organized-crime ties, resigned last week. The governor's office gave no reason for his departure. Mr. Consovoy, who has a history of heart trouble, has been on medical leave since mid-June, shortly after he was summoned to the governor's office for a meeting with her chief of staff. Since then, the attorney general's office, which is defending a lawsuit by inmates still awaiting the parole hearings that they were entitled to months ago, found about 2,800 inmates beyond their parole-eligibility dates who had not received hearings or were still awaiting a decision or release.</p>
