        <p>And yet another Bronx, as well as New York, institution is taken away from us (''Taking the Big Tepee From the Bronx to Maryland,'' July 23). George Gustav Heye established his trust and foundation for the people of the state of New York. That is how the trust reads. Apparently that is not good enough for the politicians who broke the New York State trust.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, it was a New York museum with artifacts and displays of Native American life from the metropolitan region. I considered it a museum for everyone; young and old found something of interest. The fact that it was ''way uptown'' never stopped me from attending. I had always wanted to research some topic so I could get into the Pelham Bay warehouse but couldn't think of a topic. The written materials, housed in the Huntington Free Library and Reading Room on Westchester Square, are so far safe from the hands of the greedy Washington bureaucrats.</p>

        <p>And as for the displays in the old Custom House on Bowling Green, I cannot see how they can even pass that place off as a museum. It is a good thing admission is free because the waste of space and lack of displays would warrant a refund.</p>
