        <p>Barbara D Worden letter responds to Peter Applebome's July 23 column on loud, obscene rap music being played by man at gas pump (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Many readers responded to Peter Applebome's July 23 Soapbox column about racial mores and suburban manners at a gas station in Westchester County. The problem the column posed was what, if anything, to say to or do about the black gentleman sharing his expletive-laden music with the world and also Mr. Applebome's 9-year-old daughter.</p>
        <p>Here is a sampling of readers' reactions.</p>
        <p>I have been in this situation myself several times. I believe the issue is one of manners, civility and courteous behavior in public, such as saying ''thank you'' when someone holds a door, or lets you go first. I think raising the race card is a bogus issue. In addition, I think the content of the music is irrelevant because the time was so brief, and censorship is another matter.</p>

        <p>Here is a sampling of readers' reactions.</p>
        <p>I have been in this situation myself several times. I believe the issue is one of manners, civility and courteous behavior in public, such as saying ''thank you'' when someone holds a door, or lets you go first. I think raising the race card is a bogus issue. In addition, I think the content of the music is irrelevant because the time was so brief, and censorship is another matter.</p>
        <p>I have not asked the offender to turn down the music, at any of the times I was offended. Primarily because the music wasn't that loud and the last time an incident occurred, it was at night, and there was a group of young African-American males and me at the gas station. I wouldn't ask a group of young males of any color to turn down their music, simply because there is only one of me and I'm a midlife Caucasian woman.</p>
        <p>The offenders in my situations were usually African-American, but not always. They were always young and male, and I believe it's a poorly intended macho thing. Why not write another article about the generally declining lack of manners and boorish behavior in public places? It would be a good follow-up.</p>
