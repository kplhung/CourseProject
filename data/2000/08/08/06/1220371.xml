        <p>FRANK ROOT can breeze through Fairfield, his hometown, without being recognized, but there is hardly a Broadway dancer who doesn't know him. He has worked steadily as a supporting actor and director for more than 20 years, including choreographing as many as 7,000 dancers in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. Currently, Mr. Root is performing in ''George M!'' at Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam in the supporting role of George M. Cohan's father, Jerry.</p>
        <p>''I've played George 15 years ago and I've played Jerry before, too,'' Mr. Root said after a recent performance. ''I'm more like Jerry Cohan than George. Jerry was polite, sedate. He didn't like getting in people's way.''</p>

        <p>FRANK ROOT can breeze through Fairfield, his hometown, without being recognized, but there is hardly a Broadway dancer who doesn't know him. He has worked steadily as a supporting actor and director for more than 20 years, including choreographing as many as 7,000 dancers in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. Currently, Mr. Root is performing in ''George M!'' at Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam in the supporting role of George M. Cohan's father, Jerry.</p>
        <p>''I've played George 15 years ago and I've played Jerry before, too,'' Mr. Root said after a recent performance. ''I'm more like Jerry Cohan than George. Jerry was polite, sedate. He didn't like getting in people's way.''</p>
        <p>On stage, Mr. Root is hardly sedate and yet never in people's way. Other than John Scherer in the title role, Mr. Root has the busiest feet in the production. He takes part in 18 of the 29 musical numbers, which is more than many of the company members nearly half his age. There aren't many middle-aged hoofers who can handle the load eight performances a week. ''Frank is a wonderful performer and a wonderful person,'' said Greg Ganakas, director of the musical. ''It is a demanding role, but Frank is a tireless worker.''</p>
        <p>One reason Mr. Root can handle the rigors of his role is that he has been dancing since his childhood in St. Louis. His mother, a dancer, started Mr. Root in classes when he was 7, along with his three sisters. By the time he was in his early 20's, Mr. Root had developed into an accomplished dancer, specializing in tap.</p>
        <p>Mr. Root has performed on Broadway and in national touring productions of ''42nd Street,'' ''Mack and Mabel'' and ''Pirates of Penzance,'' to name a few. He has also directed and choreographed roughly a dozen other professional productions. Not strictly a song and dance man, Mr. Root also acts in straight plays, such as the Off Broadway production of ''Dealer's Choice'' a few seasons ago. He also teaches acting at New York University.</p>
        <p>In 1977 his dance training introduced him to more than just work. He met Marianne Challis, a singer and actress, during a production of ''Follies'' at the Milwaukee Melody Tent. The two never parted and married a few years later. The couple worked together often, which is not easy in a business that offers more than enough unemployment for single people. Mr. Root has in fact worked so much that this is his fifth production of ''George M!,'' a relatively obscure musical in which few of today's young actors get a chance to perform.</p>
        <p>''George M!'' was originally produced on Broadway in 1968 with Joel Grey in the title role. The show vaguely chronicles the life of the original ''Yankee Doodle Dandy'' from his youthful days in the family act, ''The Four Cohans,'' through his last hurrah in the 1937 musical spoof of F.D.R., ''I'd Rather Be Right.''</p>
        <p>Written by Michael Stewart and Francine and John Pascal, ''George M!'' features the best of Cohan's popular music, from his romantic ''Mary's a Grand Old Name'' to his banner-waving ''You're a Grand Old Flag.'' The musical is based on both Mr. Cohan's autobiography and the 1942 film ''Yankee Doodle Dandy,'' in which James Cagney won his only Oscar in the leading role. Considering that ''George M!'' opened during the height of the Vietnam war, it was a solid hit with its 437-performance run. ''The show is fairly honest in its portrayal of Cohan,'' Mr. Root said. ''He was pretty egotistical and not the most popular person in the business.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Root said that his favorite moment in the show is when Mr. Cohan shows his vulnerability. ''It's right before George opens his first big hit, 'Little Johnny Jones,' '' he said. ''The curtain's about to go up when George tells Jerry he's afraid to fail. That relieves Jerry, who tells him that now he's ready to be a hit.''</p>
        <p>This is Mr. Root's first show at Goodspeed. He said he enjoyed working close to home so he could spend time with Ms. Challis and their two children, Lonnie and Abigail.</p>
        <p>''Marianne and I have lots of friends who have worked here,'' Mr. Root said, ''so we've come up to see shows. I really like it. It's beautiful. The town is so quaint.'' But, he added: ''The best thing is the work. Although I really enjoy teaching and directing, my first love has been performing. This show is a lot of work, but I'm enjoying it.''</p>
        <p>''George M!'' is at Goodspeed Opera in East Haddam through Oct. 7. (860) 873-8668. Tickets $20-$42.</p>
