        <p>It is a familiar sequence of events to anyone who has spent much time in a doctor's office. You have blood taken, you call for the results, you get on with your life and then weeks, months or even years later, you receive a bill from the laboratory or an explanation-of-benefits letter from your insurance company.</p>
        <p>These missives can be maddening, and not only because they arrive so long after the fact. There is usually no way for a layman to discern the test in question or which doctor ordered it; all you see are a few numerical codes. Unless you own the handbook that explains what ''82947'' stands for, you're at least one phone call away from an explanation.</p>

        <p>It is a familiar sequence of events to anyone who has spent much time in a doctor's office. You have blood taken, you call for the results, you get on with your life and then weeks, months or even years later, you receive a bill from the laboratory or an explanation-of-benefits letter from your insurance company.</p>
        <p>These missives can be maddening, and not only because they arrive so long after the fact. There is usually no way for a layman to discern the test in question or which doctor ordered it; all you see are a few numerical codes. Unless you own the handbook that explains what ''82947'' stands for, you're at least one phone call away from an explanation.</p>
        <p>I received one of those letters recently -14 pages, printed on both sides, concerning blood tests from a mere two summers ago. According to Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, my insurer at the time of the tests, I still owed the laboratory $186.85. I called the lab, which deciphered the identity of the doctor and test, and further informed me that I owed nothing.</p>
        <p>Two representatives at Empire Blue Cross, whose recent television ads have promised improved customer service, gave me the telephonic version of the blank stare. I eventually established that I amindeed in the clear.</p>
        <p>But why do these cryptic letters arrive so late? How are ordinary people supposed to make sense of them?</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, the answer depends on whom you ask. Laboratories say the blame rests squarely with doctors, who do not give them all the information needed to process bills. Doctors have a relationship with their patients, they say, but labs are just hired guns, processing tests at the doctor's behest and then issuing bills to insurers and patients.</p>
        <p>Lab representatives say they often do not get complete insurance information or proper diagnostic codes from doctors. As a result, they say, lab bills are misdirected or are rejected by the insurance company. ''Our mantra is that we don't see the patient,'' said Joanne Glisson, vice president for governmental relations at the American Clinical Lab Association, a trade group. ''We really are like a middleman.'' In other words, at the mercy of the doctor's office.</p>
        <p>Doctors don't see it that way. Dr. Lawrence Ossias, a hematologist in Manhattan, said he recently stopped using one lab because of its billing practices. He had contracted to have services ''bundled'' a package deal of sorts for a half-dozen blood tests. But managed-care companies insisted on itemized bills. When the claims managers saw the lab's much higher piecemeal rates, they were ''laughing and paying $20,'' Dr. Ossias said even less than the bundled rate he had negotiated.</p>
        <p>So, he said, the lab started itemizing its bills to all patients, apparently hoping that some would pay retail and make up for the low H.M.O. payments. ''It has been a real nightmare,'' he said. ''Patients assume their insurance companies have been billed, and then six months later a bill shows up and they wonder what it is.'' He found himself having to negotiate with the lab on patients' behalf, he said.</p>
        <p>Sharon Hawkins, the president of ClaimsPro, a claims processing company in Toledo, Ohio, said she could deal with these headaches better than the labs and doctors could. Her company takes outgoing bills and screens them, using special software to make sure that all the coding and other essential information required by insurers is where it belongs. Bills go out the door within 24 hours after she receives them, she said.</p>
        <p>ClaimsPro collects a fee only when the screened bills are paid, so it is motivated to be accurate and fast. ''A lot of labs do their billing in-house and are very slow,'' Ms. Hawkins said. Companies like hers, she added, are gaining business as insurer requirements become more stringent and as coding grows more complex.</p>
        <p>What can patients do? Start by calling the lab to make sure that it has your correct insurance information. When you receive a bill, follow up and make sure it is correct; if I had simply paid my bill without question, I would have dumped nearly $200 out the window. If you are having extensive tests, go over billing issues with your doctor's office in advance.</p>
        <p>Even so, there is a limit to how much aggravation you can head off. ''It is a very frustrating process,'' said David Nichols, vice president for marketing at Clinical Diagnostic Services in Englewood, N.J., where my lab work was done. ''Doctors frustrate labs, labs frustrate patients, patients frustrate insurance companies. This is what is wrong with health care in a nutshell.</p>
