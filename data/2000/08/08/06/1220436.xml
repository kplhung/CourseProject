        <p>ON MOST Saturdays in summer, Anthony Perrotta awakens to the clatter of breakfast dishes, the slamming of screen doors and the ceaseless chatter coming from the first floor of his four-bedroom 1920's stucco home overlooking Sunset Lake. The weekly ritual has begun: friends and neighbors drop in to discuss where everyone will be for lunch, whether it's a beach day, who will be host of a cocktail or dinner party, and what time they'll stop by the club at night.</p>
        <p>Another activity that frequently dominates Mr. Perrotta's weekend agenda is arranging tours of the northern section of the city, with participants seeking ''for sale'' signs on houses, some of which may have stood vacant for so long it is hard to tell where the yard ends and the front porch begins. In the last several months there has been a growing -- and unfamiliar -- interest in real estate in this faded shore resort to a degree that realtors and city officials say they have not seen in almost 20 years.</p>
        <p>While officials like to attribute the resurgence to the long-anticipated, ever-looming redevelopment of the city's decaying waterfront, those in the real estate business and those moving in say it is being driven by the market, which at the moment is largely made up of urban, professional gay men and women.</p>
        <p>''Five years ago, a house might sit on the market for two years,'' said one realtor, Bruce Donaldson.  ''A year ago it would take six months, now they're on the market for an average of two months, and many are being sold privately before they even get listed,'' Mr. Donaldson added, noting that the asking prices had doubled over the last five years, and jumped by close to 50 percent in the last year alone.</p>
        <p>Mr. Donaldson, who is also chairman of city planning board, said he had sold as many houses in Asbury Park in the first few months of this year as he sold during all of last year, with about 80 percent of his current buyers being gay.</p>
        <p>Cheaper than the Hamptons, more relaxed than Fire Island, easier to get to than Miami Beach or Provincetown (or, for that matter, the Hamptons and Fire Island), this oceanfront city -- just an hour from Manhattan -- is seen by some as the next gay enclave. Those buying homes here either as weekend getaways or permanent residences cite several appeals: affordable houses, beautiful architecture, an almost private beach, plentiful entertainment and a certain ''seediness'' that has its own charm. And as their numbers grow, the gays moving in are increasingly finding a sense of community in this city of 17,000.</p>
        <p>''It's not the Hamptons, where it's all about who's fabulous and what you're wearing,'' said Mr. Perrotta, 28, a Manhattan interior designer who with his partner, an attorney, bought two houses in Asbury Park in the last 10 months. ''It's not the muscle boys and sex and parties of Fire Island. We all have the same bohemian mentality here: anything goes and nothing matters. It's the gay ghetto, and it's only going to get better.''</p>
        <p>Janice Gutloff, a 47-year-old guidance counselor for the New York City Board of Education who bought a 13-bedroom home with her partner here last November, said she had already made new friends since spending the summer here this year.  ''There's an acceptance here, a feeling of community, and there are a few gathering places for gay and lesbian people,'' said Ms. Gutloff, whose house also overlooks Sunset Lake. ''There are lots of things going on here.''</p>
        <p>Probably the biggest draw are the bargains, where a large single-family house can be scooped up for about $150,000, about a third of the price for a similar home in such neighboring shore towns as Deal, Loch Arbour or Interlaken, and close to the cost of a seasonal rental on a prime place in Fire Island or the Hamptons. Of course, the reason real estate is so affordable here is that this 1.5-square-mile city has been impaled on hard times for more than two decades.</p>
        <p>Founded in 1871 by James Brady, a visionary developer who also began neighboring Ocean Grove, Asbury Park was designed to be the premier resort destination on the Jersey Shore, with avenues 100 to 200 feet wide, two lakes and a mile-long oceanfront boardwalk. By 1890, the city boasted a 1,200-seat opera house, a dozen grand hotels, 1,000 guest cottages, and several large mansions owned by some of New York's finest families. A fire in 1917 wiped out many of the city's buildings, but that only made way for an even bigger building boom in the 1920's, which included the Convention Hall and the Casino, two Art Deco waterfront gems that have long since fallen into disrepair, as well as hundreds of other Victorian and Colonial-style homes.</p>
        <p>The waterfront amusements drew hundreds of thousands of visitors annually in the 1940's and 50's, but by the 1960's the city had begun to look frayed around the edges. Businesses moved out of the downtown commercial district in favor of nearby malls, then race riots in 1969 dealt the downtown its final blow. Despite Bruce Springsteen's attempt to put the city back on the map with his 1973 album ''Greetings from Asbury Park,'' the city continued to decline until a promise to revitalize the waterfront in the mid-1980's by a Connecticut developer, Joseph Carabetta, brought another surge of interest in Asbury Park. But Mr. Carabetta's financial failure left the waterfront in a state of abandonment, as it remains today.</p>
        <p>Homeowners fled, leaving many properties in the hands of the city or absentee landlords who divided most of the larger homes into multi-unit rental properties. According to the latest figures supplied by the city, of the 7,692 housing units, 1,730 are single-family homes and only 1,584 are occupied by the owner.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, however, some of the factors that have driven away other potential home buyers -- the blighted and sparsely visited waterfront, the multiracial population, and the deteriorating housing stock -- are precisely what the urban gay population finds most attractive.</p>
        <p>''I love it the way it is now,'' said Bernard Figueroa, speaking about the vast, dilapidated amusement buildings that line Ocean Avenue. ''It's very particular and very intriguing. I think it's beautiful.''</p>
        <p>Moreover, Mr. Figueroa, who is French, also dislikes Americans' attitudes about race and finds a perfect antidote in Asbury Park.</p>
        <p>''People in America are so racist and prejudiced,'' said Mr. Figueroa, a 39-year-old shoe designer from New York who expects to close on a house on Third Avenue this summer. ''They think if a neighborhood is more than 20 percent black it's a bad neighborhood. Between the gay people and the black people here, it makes an anti-yuppie atmosphere which I love.''</p>
        <p>His partner, Ted Scheffler, also says the multicultural aspect of Asbury Park was a deciding factor on where to raise the son he adopted in China four years ago. Mr. Scheffler, who teaches English as a second language, hopes to teach in Asbury Park in what many call a substandard school system that discourages families from living here. But for gay couples with children, Asbury Park again offers the best of both worlds.</p>
        <p>''I was brought up in a house, and I wanted my son to have that same experience, but it needed to be in a community that accepted his parents as well,'' said Mr. Scheffler, 42, who admitted he was still weighing options on where to send his 4-year-old son, Matthew, to school. ''That's usually not so easy to find in suburban setting, and in most city settings, you're not going to find a lot of gay couples with kids.''</p>
        <p>Nor is Mr. Scheffler the only gay family man in town. Morgan Mulford and his partner, Doug Palumbo, were among the first couples to buy a home in Asbury Park six years ago when they purchased a four-bedroom Craftsman-style house for $70,000. Mr. Mulford's 8-year-old son and 10-year-old daughter spend Christmas and summer vacations here with their father, and live with their mother in Florida the rest of the year.</p>
        <p>''Because it's a town that's coming back, everybody is very open-minded,'' said Mr. Mulford, 39, a director of annuity sales for New York Life. ''It's introduced the kids to a lot of different people, and if our goal is to expose them to and be accepting of a lot of things, then this is a good place for them to be.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Palumbo, who grew up here but moved in the early 1970's with his family in what he refers to as ''the white flight,'' said that historically, Asbury Park had always been friendly to gays. He remembers the dozen gay bars that lined Ocean Avenue in the early 1980's, before many of the buildings were condemned by Mr. Carabetta. For the last six years, New Jersey Gay Pride Day has been held here on the first weekend in June, drawing thousands from New Jersey, New York and Philadelphia. So when the couple was looking for a weekend retreat, Mr. Palumbo thought of his hometown.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Palumbo and Mr. Mulford may have been pioneers at the time, they now estimate that almost 50 percent of their block is gay, evidenced by the rainbow flags that fly outside many of the homes. Several rainbow flags also fly on homes on Locust Drive, where two longtime Greenwich Village residents, Deborah Walsh and her partner Carla Simpson, bought a five-bedroom colonial on Deal Lake for about $100,000 two years ago. Ms. Simpson is currently trying to get pregnant through artificial insemination because, as Ms. Walsh puts it: ''It's a good place to raise a family. There's space and acceptance here.''</p>
        <p>Throughout the northern section of the city, multifamily homes are being converted back to single-family houses and restored to their original beauty. Speculators like RDR Properties are buying dozens of places, rehabilitating them, and putting them back on the market at a tidy profit. They say the problem is no longer a dormant real estate market but not having enough supply to fill the demand.</p>
        <p>Houses in the most sought-after sections of the city -- a four-square-block area bordered on the north by Deal Lake, on the south by Sunset Lake, on the east by Park Avenue and on the west by Main Street, plus the northwest part of the city near Deal Lake -- often exchange hands privately, never making it to market.</p>
        <p>''I just wish I had more listings,,'' said Georgia Burns, who has been in the real estate business here for 40 years. ''There's not much left here to sell.'' Acknowledging that many of the interested buyers are now gay, Ms. Burns calls her current client crop ''the best buyers I ever had.''</p>
        <p>''They're wonderful people,'' she added. ''They love the old houses and they're restoring them.''</p>
        <p>There are even signs of life at the Asbury Park beach, which, despite a recent sand replenishment program and the reasonable $20 seasonal beach tag charge, is usually all but deserted. Two weeks ago, more than 500 black and Hispanic lesbians spread their blankets on the white sands of the city's north beach. The women were holding their sixth annual beach party, this year choosing Asbury Park over Fire Island because ''it was a little more hospitable,'' said the event's organizer, Tracey Pridgen.</p>
        <p>''The town council was very warm, said Ms. Pridgen, a Jersey City resident who also caught the home-buying fever after coming here in April. ''We really felt very welcome and it's going to be our new home from now on.'' Since then, she said, she has checked out 15 houses.</p>
        <p>Some savvy buyers aren't waiting for a house they like to go on the market. Mr. Perrotta, the interior designer from Manhattan, and his partner spent the Martin Luther King weekend knocking on the door and leaving notes at a house on Sunset Drive that they had their eyes on, asking the owners if they were interested in selling. On Monday they saw a police car at the house and found out the owner had died over the weekend. They contacted her relatives in New York and worked out a sale privately.</p>
        <p>Others are pushing the borders of what is considered a stable neighborhood in Asbury Park, anticipating gentrification to continue to march southward. Jerry Scarano of Manhattan bought a 12--by-40-foot, two-story cottage on Second Avenue in April for only $20,000. Mr. Scarano spent another $12,000 replacing the bathroom, kitchen and roof, and adding siding and Victorian gingerbread to the outside. In July, his house was awarded the ''Beautiful House of the Month'' by the city's zoning board. Although his house is in a neighborhood that realtors like Mr. Donaldson would call transitional at best, Mr. Scarano is unfazed by the loud rap music that pours out of neighbors' windows and the frequent loitering in the streets. Instead, he has befriended the neighbors, who consider him something of an anomaly.</p>
        <p>''While I was cleaning the place out I developed a network of contacts,'' said Mr. Scarano, 45, who hopes to be able to sell his house and double his investment so he can buy a larger house for himself here. ''Everyday people in the neighborhood came by and asked me if I needed any help. I was able to hire them as day workers for about a third of the price that contractors were asking.''</p>
        <p>The newfound interest in homes here is beginning to have a spillover effect on other aspects of life. A few artists are moving back into some of the loft spaces along Cookman Avenue downtown. Activity has picked up at the Emeralds and Pearls cafe and gift shop on Bangs Avenue, particularly during the pre-dawn, post-club hours. Billy Meisch, who owns the retro furniture store, House of Modern Living, on Cookman Avenue, said he had been seeing a lot of new clients.</p>
        <p>''They may need a new couch or a chair, and it's a lot easier buying it here than carting it down from Soho,'' said Mr. Meisch, who moved to Asbury Park in March after living in neighboring Ocean Grove for 20 years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Meisch said Ocean Grove, which also has a large gay population, had become ''too family-oriented.''</p>
        <p>The year-and-a-half-old alternative newspaper, triCityNews, has become a popular source for what's happening in the city, including news from the active night life that floats among the city's four gay bars.</p>
        <p>With renewed talk of creating a state-controlled redevelopment authority to press forward on the proposed $780 million waterfront revitalization, Asbury Park's currency may go even higher. But for some who distrust the decisions of the current government, getting a foothold in the political arena is the only way to guarantee that the city continues to move in the right direction.</p>
        <p>Last month, Robert DeSanto, who is a student and tends bar at Club Paradise, said he organized a ''meet and greet your neighbors'' event at the club, in part to ''get everyone in to one place so we can see what our numbers are.'' While only about 50 people turned out, many who did joined the homeowners' association and filled out forms to switch their voter registration to Asbury Park, Mr. DeSanto said.</p>
        <p>In a city where fewer than 10 percent of the residents typically turn out to vote, every vote counts. John Loffredo, president of the Asbury Park Homeowners Association, ran for City Council in 1997 and lost by a few hundred votes. Mr. Loffredo plans to run again next May, and, while he says he is not running as ''the gay representative,'' he believes ''the outcome will be different'' based on the current makeup of voters.</p>
        <p>''Right now there's no gay representation on the council, but hopefully we're moving in that direction,'' said Mr. DeSanto, who ran for the school board last April and lost by a small number of absentee ballots. ''We're homeowners here, and it's important for us to keep our property values up.''</p>
        <p>For now, the political establishment may be a bit wary of the shifting demographics of Asbury Park. While acknowledging the increased presence of gays and lesbians in Asbury Park, Deputy Mayor John Hamilton does not see turning the keys to the city over to them any time soon.</p>
        <p>''While I'm open to anyone moving here, I'm certainly not going to try to have Asbury Park designated as the gay mecca of New Jersey,'' Mr. Hamilton said. ''If we do gear ourselves toward an entire gay and lesbian population, will we end up discriminating against straight people?''</p>
