        <p>Sarah Lynne Ford and Paul Hammond Younger V, both 27, were married on Tuesday in Eureka Springs, Ark., by Morris Pate, a justice of the peace there. Yesterday, at the Crescent Hotel in Eureka Springs, the bride and bridegroom held a second ceremony, which was led by Dr. Richard Nault, the dean of students at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, from which the couple graduated magna cum laude.</p>
        <p>The bride, a daughter of Arlene and Charles Ford of Madison, Wis., will begin studies at New York University Law School this month. The bridegroom, the son of Susan and Paul H. Younger IV of Hudson, Ohio, is a computer software development engineer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Younger first noticed Ms. Ford when she was in a debate during his sophomore year at Miami of Ohio, and he remembered ''her poise under fire.'' She recalled first spotting him in the student union building and being taken with his ''quiet confidence.''</p>
        <p>Both later attended a class that required them to attend a concert series and to write reviews. Ms. Ford happened to learn that Mr. Younger had taken a subscription to the series with another woman in the class. Ms. Ford, who had also subscribed, asked the other student to switch tickets, which she did. But Ms. Ford had not yet been introduced to Mr. Younger, nor was she sure he would be happy with the arrangement. One day in the fall of 1993 she knocked at the door of his dorm room.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Younger opened the door, Ms. Ford asked straight out whether he was in love with the other student.</p>
        <p>''It was a strange question out of the blue,'' Mr. Younger recalled. ''When I told her no, she said she was going to be my date.''</p>
        <p>Over the next months they got to know each other, and their relationship progressed quickly. Perhaps too quickly. So Mr. Younger spent the next year, his junior year, studying in Sweden, while Ms. Ford took the year off to intern in a gang-prevention program for school children in Los Angeles. The two didn't communicate again until nearly the end of the academic year.</p>
        <p>''I am a look-before-I-leap kind of guy,'' Mr. Younger said. ''She is the opposite. I found that I did love her and wanted to get back together with her.''</p>
        <p>After graduation in 1996, they moved to Los Angeles. There, they found work and lived together for three years. But they still were not sure that they would marry. To make up their minds, they took a nine-month trip around the world at the suggestion of Mr. Younger's father.</p>
        <p>''Sarah and I went on the trip believing that we would either decide to get married or break up by the end of it,'' Mr. Younger said.</p>
        <p>Midway on their journey, he proposed. It was just after midnight at a New Year's Eve 2000 party in Istanbul, overlooking the Bosporus.</p>
        <p>''He dropped to one knee, and I was so surprised that I didn't answer immediately,'' Ms. Ford said. ''It became a little awkward.'' Finally, she shouted, ''Yes!''</p>
