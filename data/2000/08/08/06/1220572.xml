        <p>As a longtime resident of Cold Spring Harbor, it was with great interest that I read your article regarding the new state park being established in our neighborhood [''Cold Spring Harbor Finds Land for Park,'' July 23].</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, if the comments made by Bernadette Castro, our state parks commissioner, and Pat Reiss, our town spokeswoman, are any indication of the planning behind the intensified use proposed for this property, I am somewhat skeptical of the outcome.</p>
        <p>Ms. Reiss stated that visitors to the new park will continue to share its parking lot with town residents and boaters. Her comments -- ''I don't see any problems'' and ''I've never seen that lot filled to capacity'' -- are entirely unfounded.</p>
        <p>I am not sure when Ms. Reiss has visited the area, but on the day your article was published, the traffic in this area was nothing short of chaotic. Not only was the lot filled by late morning, but cars and boat trailers were parked all along Route 25A.</p>
        <p>Cold Spring Harbor is a residential area with limited access from Route 25A, a heavily traveled two-lane road. State and local officials appear to have gone ahead with the park with no planning for the increased traffic it will bring to an area that is already heavily congested.</p>
