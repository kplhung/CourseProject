        <p>A hundred years ago, shortly after George W. Vanderbilt built a 250-room French Renaissance country estate outside this western North Carolina city in the Blue Ridge Mountains, he carefully sketched out plans for a 50-room inn on the property.</p>
        <p>His list began with $3,200 for 449 doors and windows. It ended with a total: $17,509.29, excluding wallpaper, plumbing, heating and electrical work.</p>
        <p>Today, on a hill on what remains of Mr. Vanderbilt's estate, some two miles from the country home he called Biltmore House, a 213-room inn is taking shape. The Biltmore Company, led by Mr. Vanderbilt's great-grandson William A. V. Cecil Jr., will spend $31 million on an inn designed with the intent of giving guests a glimpse of what it was like to stay on the lavish estate about 1900.</p>
        <p>Last year, 900,000 people visited Biltmore House and its outbuildings, including a conservatory and a winery. As a tourist destination, Biltmore now employs about 1,100 people, and it served as a location for several movies, including ''Richie Rich'' and ''Being There.''</p>
        <p>Richard T. Pressley, the chief financial officer and executive vice president of the Biltmore Company, said that market research showed that 60 percent of the visitors to Biltmore House stay in local motels, and most stay in midpriced chains with room rates of about $100 a night. Most visitors are  between 35 and 54 years old, he said.</p>
        <p>''We've looked at this project for 20 years,'' Mr. Pressley said. Once convinced it was sound financially, company officials spent 18 months interviewing architects and contractors. They selected Thompson, Ventulett &amp; Stainback Associates of Atlanta as its architect, along with the Design Workshop of Aspen, Colo., landscape architect;  Hughes Design Associates of McLean, Va.,  interior designer; and the W. G. Yates &amp; Sons Construction Company of Philadelphia, Miss.</p>
        <p>The designers took some of their cues from the work of the distinguished team that designed Biltmore House before the turn of the century. Richard Morris Hunt, architect for the center part of the Fifth Avenue facade of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, designed the house. Frederick Law Olmsted, who designed Central Park with Calvert Vaux, created the landscape plan.</p>
        <p>In designing the hotel, to be called the Inn on Biltmore Estate, ''the intent was partially to create a building that didn't compete  with the house but gave guests a sense of staying at the house,'' said Scott Sickeler, the project's lead architect. ''What caught me by surprise was Olmsted and the influence he had over the estate,'' he added.</p>
        <p>The designers sought to give guests the same sort of experience when driving up to the inn that visitors get on the three-mile approach road to the house, a road that  meanders through five different North Carolina landscapes. The house is not visible until visitors get right up to it. In a similar manner, guests will be given only small glimpses of the inn as they wind their way up the hillside.</p>
        <p>Landscaping, influenced by Olmsted's work, has already been done to allow a year's growth before the inn's opening, scheduled for March 1.</p>
        <p>The inn faces Mount Pisgah and Mount Pisgah National Forest. ''It is 270 degrees of uninterrupted wilderness,'' Mr. Sickeler said. Other views are of Biltmore House itself, framed by woodlands and mountains, and of downtown Asheville, several miles in the distance.</p>
        <p>The Biltmore Company decided to manage the inn itself, rather than contract with a national chain, because corporate officials wanted direct control over quality, Mr. Pressley said. The company hired as general manager Michael Chaffin, who previously managed the Stephen F. Austin Hotel in Austin, Tex., and the Omni hotel, also in Austin. Biltmore's hospitality division is managed by Thomas B. Ruff, a senior vice president of the company who previously worked with Marriott Hotels and Resorts and the Hyatt Hotels Corporation. Mr. Chaffin and Mr. Ruff say their goal is to create an inn that will win top ratings from guidebooks like those from AAA and Mobil.</p>
        <p>In-season room rates will range from $160 to $195 a night. Nine suites will be available, ranging from $900 to $2,000 a night. The $2,000 suite has 1,400 square feet with a sitting room and one bedroom with an optional second bedroom. Discount packages will be available, but prices have not been set, Mr. Ruff said.</p>
        <p>The inn can accommodate small corporate functions, but not conventions. Its largest meeting room will be the 1,800-square-foot Vanderbilt Room, and it will also have two smaller meeting rooms and two banquet rooms.</p>
        <p>The lobby will have a large fireplace that  mimics the huge fireplaces of Biltmore House. Mr. Vanderbilt was a book collector, and so the inn will have a library, an unusual feature for a hotel. The restaurant will be  called simply the Restaurant at the Inn on  Biltmore Estate. Guests will also be able to eat in the more casual restaurant at the estate's winery, just down the hill. Admission to Biltmore House -- $32 for adults --  will not be included in the room rates, and the inn will have a gatehouse, meant to keep out the merely curious.</p>
        <p>The company has incorporated some of the signature features of Biltmore House in the inn's design. Limestone, used on the exterior of the house, will cover the lobby floor. The roof will be slate, and oak for the  library came from trees on the property, as did the black walnut floors for the private dining room.</p>
        <p>The inn will compete with two other venerable Asheville hotels, the 510-room Grove Park Inn, which is now building a $27 million  40,000-square-foot spa, and the 36-room Richmond Hill Inn. The area also has a number of upscale B &amp; B's as well.</p>
        <p>The company will begin taking reservations for the inn in October, and group  events scheduled after April 15, 2001, are already being booked.</p>
        <p>The Vanderbilt connection with the Asheville area began when George W. Vanderbilt, a grandson of the steamboat and railroad industrialist Cornelius Vanderbilt, visited the North Carolina mountains in the late 1880's. The area was known for its healing mineral springs and fresh mountain  air. In 1888, Mr. Vanderbilt decided it was the place for his country home. He began  buying land, eventually assembling an estate of 125,000 acres, and commissioned designs for the house and its landscaping.</p>
        <p>The house took six years to build. It covers four acres and included many amenities unusual for its time: elevators, electric lights and telephones. The first major event held there took place on Christmas Eve in 1895, when Mr. Vanderbilt, then a 33-year-old bachelor, entertained dozens of guests who had arrived in five train cars from New York and Newport, R.I. Through the years, Mr. Vanderbilt and his wife, Edith, entertained many celebrities at Biltmore, including Henry James, Edith Wharton and John Singer Sargent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vanderbilt died in 1914 during an emergency appendectomy in Washington,  and Mrs. Vanderbilt returned to the estate, where the couple's only child, Cornelia, grew up. Over the years, Mrs. Vanderbilt donated and sold off much of the estate. Some 87,000 acres were deeded to the federal government for what is now Pisgah National Forest. Another chunk became Biltmore Village, a commercial area now just outside the Biltmore House gate.</p>
        <p>But the house and 8,000 acres have remained in the family through four generations. It was opened to the public in 1930 at the request of Asheville city officials who hoped it would bolster an economy reeling from the Depression. It closed during World War II and was reopened in 1945.</p>
        <p>By 1959, Biltmore House was losing $250,000 a year. William A. V. Cecil, a grandson of Mr. Vanderbilt and then a New York banker, returned to the family business shortly thereafter and began a turnaround that many people told him could not be achieved. The house was placed on the national Register of Historic Places in 1963, and almost a decade later, Biltmore made a profit: $16.</p>
        <p>''The best money I've ever made,'' Mr. Cecil, now chairman of the Biltmore Company and the father of the current chief executive, is reported to have said.</p>
