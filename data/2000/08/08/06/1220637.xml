        <p>Friday was to have been a day of reckoning for the leader of Malaysia's reform movement, Anwar Ibrahim. Given the furies that have swirled around Mr. Anwar for the last two years, it could have been a day of reckoning for his country as well.</p>
        <p>But on Thursday, the judge in his trial on sodomy charges unexpectedly delayed the verdict. Now, a tense air of expectancy has descended on this city. From office suites to roadside food stalls, people are debating why the judge did not hand down his ruling as scheduled.</p>
        <p>Conspiracy theories abound. Some say Malaysia's prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, feared that a guilty verdict would draw thousands of protesters into the streets in a noisy repeat of the battles that raged after Mr. Anwar was convicted of corruption last year. Others contend that the judge is wrestling with his conscience, and may stun the country by acquitting Mr. Anwar, a former deputy prime minister and Mahathir protege, of sexual misconduct.</p>
        <p>To the 500 Anwar supporters who turned out on Friday in front of the High Court -- brandishing portraits of the ousted deputy prime minister, chanting ''Reformasi'' and scuffling with the police -- it was evidence of a government with something to fear from its people.</p>
        <p>''Perhaps they did not want a show of support for Anwar,'' said Chandra Muzaffar, deputy president of the pro-reform National Justice Party, which was formed, with Mr. Anwar as its standard-bearer, after his first conviction. ''If you look at all the factors, the regime is not as strong as people think they are.''</p>
        <p>Those are brave words from the leader of a party that fared poorly in parliamentary elections last November, especially as Mr. Anwar could be sentenced to 20 years in jail. He is already serving six years for corruption, and is barred from politics for five years after his release.</p>
        <p>Dr. Mahathir's coalition won an unassailable two-thirds majority in the elections. The 74-year-old prime minister, Asia's longest-serving leader, has spent much of the last year consolidating his power by going after new rivals, like Malaysia's increasingly popular Islamic Party.</p>
        <p>Moreover, after nearly two years of scurrilous charges and 118 days of numbing testimony, Mr. Anwar's trial no longer provides a rallying cry for most Malaysians. While few people here say they believe he is guilty of sodomizing his wife's chauffeur -- as he is charged -- they have moved on to other distractions, like getting the most out of Malaysia's newly energized economy.</p>
        <p>''Anwar has not been as much in the public imagination over the last year,'' said K. S. Jomo, a professor of economics at the University of Malaya. ''But it's not as if Anwar's reduced visibility has helped Mahathir. A great number of people now believe this was basically a personal vendetta.''</p>
        <p>What has spread over the course of Mr. Anwar's marathon trial is a creeping cynicism. Whether it is the motives of their political leaders, the probity of the courts or even the timing of a verdict, people here now look reflexively for a hidden agenda.</p>
        <p>Much of the disillusionment is rooted in the bitter Mahathir-Anwar feud. Together the two had turned Malaysia into an economic star of Asia. But Mr. Anwar emerged as a threat to Dr. Mahathir, who ruthlessly turned on him.</p>
        <p>In September 1998, Mr. Anwar was abruptly dismissed, and a few weeks later, dozens of police officers and army troops burst into his house to arrest him. He was charged with sexual misconduct and abusing his power by interfering in a police investigation of his behavior.</p>
        <p>Mr. Anwar's trial has raised troubling questions about Malaysia's once-respected judicial system. The prosecution flailed wildly in its attempt to prove that he had engaged in ''carnal intercourse against the order of nature.'' After first alleging that Mr. Anwar had sodomized the chauffeur, Azizan Abu Bakar, ''one night in the month of May 1994,'' the prosecutors shifted the date to 1992.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Anwar's lawyers noted that the building in which the act allegedly took place had been under construction at the time, the prosecution switched the date again, to 1993. Malaysian law allows prosecutors to amend charges during a trial. Under cross-examination, Mr. Azizan said the police had ordered him to change the date.</p>
        <p>Mr. Anwar, 52, strenuously denied the charges, saying he was the victim of a conspiracy orchestrated by Dr. Mahathir. His lawyers presented alibis for almost all the days of the three-month period in 1993, during which the sexual misconduct was supposed to have taken place.</p>
        <p>''This time around, the evidence was very flimsy,'' said Mr. Anwar's wife, Wan Azizah Wan Ismail. ''The feeling one had in the courtroom was like, 'Is this for real?' ''</p>
        <p>Political analysts here said that obtaining a guilty verdict against Mr. Anwar was crucial for Dr. Mahathir. The prime minister cited his former deputy's sexual conduct as the main reason he had dismissed him. Homosexuality is taboo in this predominantly Muslim country.</p>
