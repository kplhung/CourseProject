        <p>As a famous actor, Danny Glover is used to getting all sorts of charity requests. So, when Orel Lee Brown, a widowed mother of two, asked him to speak to a group of her students in a drug-infested area of Oakland, Calif., he took the request in stride. When an opening finally came up in his schedule and Mr. Glover went to see Ms. Brown, he was amazed -- and moved -- by what he encountered.</p>
        <p>In 1987, Ms. Brown, a real estate agent, had promised a group of first graders that she'd pay for their college educations if they stayed in school. They fulfilled their end of the bargain, and she was preparing to spend everything she had to keep her word.</p>

        <p>As a famous actor, Danny Glover is used to getting all sorts of charity requests. So, when Orel Lee Brown, a widowed mother of two, asked him to speak to a group of her students in a drug-infested area of Oakland, Calif., he took the request in stride. When an opening finally came up in his schedule and Mr. Glover went to see Ms. Brown, he was amazed -- and moved -- by what he encountered.</p>
        <p>In 1987, Ms. Brown, a real estate agent, had promised a group of first graders that she'd pay for their college educations if they stayed in school. They fulfilled their end of the bargain, and she was preparing to spend everything she had to keep her word.</p>
        <p>''Little did I know this woman chaperoned kids from kindergarten and got them on their way to state colleges, black colleges,'' said Mr. Glover. ''I was so moved by the way she'd basically taken on the responsibility for 19 young lives. I was completely blown away. I realized you never know the full story unless you look closer.''</p>
        <p>He wanted to let the world know about this woman's remarkable story, and now he'll have that opportunity. Mr. Glover is a co-producer and host of ''Courage,'' a series that begins this week with four consecutive episodes, Monday through Thursday at 9 p.m., and continues on Monday nights at 9 on the Fox Family Channel.</p>
        <p>''This is a family program,'' he said with pride. ''It brings out certain values -- caring, sharing, that we are our brother's keeper. This uses the reality format, which is popular right now, but really sees the potential in people. We understand the struggles everyone we're profiling goes through. In some way, we can identify what they're going through with something in our own lives.''</p>
        <p>Most lives, however, are never tested the way those of the people in ''Courage'' have been. The show includes segments on Rudy Garcia, an 11-year-old who had both of his legs removed because of crippling disease but is now a champion runner and swimmer; Jill Cook, a 66-year-old crossing guard who threw herself in front of a speeding truck to save the lives of two children; Dennis Worsham, a 52-year-old firefighter who donated a kidney to save the life of a paramedic he barely knew; and Ammie Murray, a grandmother who has crusaded to save a frequently vandalized church where freed slaves used to worship in secret.</p>
        <p>The stories are unabashedly sentimental, and Mr. Glover makes no apologies for that. ''You get moved by these people, and you don't need to be ashamed of that,'' he said. ''You get to see the intensity of real life.''</p>
        <p>When the show's producers came to Mr. Glover with the concept for ''Courage,'' asking him to be the show's host, the idea, he said, was to do a series that was ''more of an adrenaline rush.''</p>
        <p>''It was rescue stuff, women who saved babies in earthquakes, that sort of thing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>While keeping stories like that in the mix, Mr. Glover saw the possibility of doing the series with a more activist approach. His hope is that instead of just watching and then changing the channel at the end of the hour, viewers may feel inspired to do more with their own lives.</p>
        <p>''Every one of these people felt they could make a difference,'' he said. ''Whether their acts were spontaneous, like saving the kids at a school bus stop, or deliberate, like the man I met who travels around the world riding in bicycle tours to raise money for AIDS research, they wanted to do something.''</p>
        <p>Even before ''Courage'' went on the air, its offices were receiving a steady stream of suggestions for stories. The show's staff also regularly scans newspapers from around the country in search of inspirational tales to tell.</p>
        <p>''These are stories about what we should be like as human beings,'' Mr. Glover said. ''The good is out there, and society doesn't often spend a lot of time elevating that good. The more we can do that on this show as well as in our lives, the better off we'll all be.''</p>
