        <p>Timothy P McKeown letter responds to Peter Applebome's July 23 column on loud, obscene rap music being played by man at gas pump (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>A column July 23 by Peter Applebome described a situation at a gas station in which he and his 9-year-old daughter were exposed to loud rap music with X-rated lyrics booming from the car of a black man wearing a prison guard uniform. He debated asking the man to turn the music down but decided not to. He asked readers what they would do. Here is a sampling of the many responses.</p>
        <p>Anyone inconsiderate enough to  play that kind of music in such a manner in the first place is not going to really care what anyone else says to them about it. In the distant past, I think people still cared enough so that the music would not only be turned down but an apology issued by the offender. Today, the best you can expect is that such a request will be ignored -- if you're lucky.</p>
