        <p>Whether they're cheering the football team on or wearing the school sweatshirt, students at most colleges are proud to show their school colors. But Students at virtual universities have rare opportunity to muster much spirit.</p>
        <p>''Looking for school spirit at virtual universities is like looking for wilderness in Manhattan,'' said Terry Hartle, senior vice president and online hawk-eye for the American Council on Education.</p>
        <p>A student who chooses online education (average age: 36) is often willing to forgo boosterism for convenience. ''Distance is not an emotional experience,'' said Vicky Phillips, founder of geteducated.com, a consulting agency.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, administrators of online universities are exploring ways to inspire loyalty.</p>
        <p>Kentucky Commonwealth Virtual University, for instance, is designing what it hopes will be the first virtual football conference. Each Saturday, the Web site will show a play-by-play chart (based on a real game played that week), updated standings and scores and statistics from other online schools enlisted for the league. Michigan Virtual University has challenged Kentucky to a game this fall.</p>
        <p>''We want to create a sense of community and build a team spirit among our online students,'' said Sue Patrick, a Kentucky spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>To try to forge ties with its students, Kaplancollege.com, the new online institution from the Kaplan tutoring company, plans to have online yearbooks and wine-and-cheese mixers once it is more established. Jones International Univeristy has begun selling crest-emblazoned mugs, T-shirts and caps at its online bookstore. Western Governors University also plans a line of collegiate wear.</p>
        <p>But some administrators say such promotions are gimmicks, and that online universities can create loyalty only by fostering accessibility between staff and student, and student and student. ''Loyalty doesn't come from the institution so much as it comes from the relationships you're forced to make because of the distance,'' said Dan Matthews, 44, a Western Governors student from remote Chelan, Wash.</p>
        <p>William Rosenthal, the president of Kaplancollege.com says he will try anything short of keg parties to encourage such relationships: real-time regional get-togethers, chat rooms discussion groups, motivational e-mails. He calls it the ''subdued'' approach to developing school spirit.</p>
