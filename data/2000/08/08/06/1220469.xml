        <p>FROM the days of the so-called Bronx Riviera, the bathers shown above were patrons of the Beach Shop at Orchard Beach in 1940. The image can be seen in a Parks Department exhibition that covers 130 years of commercial enterprises in the city's parks. Not only have these park concessions provided amenities to the public; they have also enriched the city: net revenues have risen from $2.5 million in 1978 to more than $42 million in 1999.</p>
        <p>The display, drawn from parks archives, is titled ''Making Concessions: A Pictorial History of Commercial Enterprises in New York City Parks, 1870-2000'' and is curated by Jonathan Kuhn, the department's director of art and antiquities. The exhibition examines commercial activity in parks as shaped by concessionaires, city policy, artistic design, popular politics and historical evolution. More than 60 photographs, plans, postcards, models and more are on view.</p>
