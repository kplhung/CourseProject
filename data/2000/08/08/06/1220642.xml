        <p>Friends of Vice Pres Al Gore, such as actor Tommy Lee Jones, his Harvard classmate, express irritation at what they see as hostile press coverage of Gore, contending media ignores reality that Gore is a funny, warm, thoughtful and decent person--not the 'stiff' person frequently portrayed in press (M)</p>

        <p>After  ''hello''  and what he said to the waitress: Was somebody going to take his hat or was he going to have to throw it on the floor? -- the first words out of Tommy Lee Jones were, ''I'll answer any decent question that you have.'' As though he might have to take his hat back on short notice.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jones had agreed to meet over lunch at the San Ysidro Ranch to talk about his Harvard classmate Al Gore. But like so many of Mr. Gore's intimates, Mr. Jones arrived aggrieved. And before coughing up any stories from the old days, he had some venting to do.</p>
        <p>Even such a wobbly softball question as, ''So, you guys have stayed in touch?'' got this response: ''We get together when we're in the same city. Just like real people.'' Asked what Mr. Gore had been like at Harvard, Mr. Jones said: ''Funny, a real pleasure to be around. He still is.'' Mr. Jones cursed ''this stiffness thing'' and said that reporters who attributed cynical motives to his friend ''are busy writing about themselves.''</p>
        <p>Not every friend of Mr. Gore's, of course, has been through the years of ''Hard Copy'' and paparazzi that Mr. Jones has endured as an A-list movie star. But virtually all are similarly steamed over the coverage of his presidential campaign, and just as frustrated that the public perception of him seems distorted as a result.</p>
        <p>''You don't want to talk about this?'' Mr. Jones said, nuking an attempt to steer the conversation back to Harvard. Clearly, he and others do. In fact, their complaints have become Topic A in interviews with Mr. Gore's old friends, an assortment of mainly nonfamous and nonpolitical types he met in school, the Army and back in Tennessee.</p>
        <p>They do not recognize their Al Gore in the stories they read. Almost invariably, they want to know why a man they know to be decent, thoughtful and funny -- they always say funny -- is so often drawn as not even quite human.</p>
        <p>Yet they have answers, too. And beyond their irritation at what they see as a hostile press corps -- described in a recent article in The New Yorker as ''palpably seething'' over their lack of access to him -- these friends are probably better equipped than anyone to see Mr. Gore's own role in the way he is portrayed.</p>
        <p>Often, they point to his sensitivity and essential shyness. ''Behind closed doors he takes a lot of that stuff personal, takes it harder than he can show,'' and then further withdraws, said Steve Armistead, Mr. Gore's closest childhood friend, who runs the roads department in Wilson County, Tenn. ''He does not show his human side that well.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gore's friends also suggest that there is an element of willfulness, even a certain defiance, born of an enduring ambivalence over the whole business of politics, in his unevenness on the stump. To hear them tell it, he can and does decide when to turn on the charm.</p>
        <p>Several of his friends used almost the same words, ''You've probably never seen him be funny.'' Yet when contradicted, they countered that a reporter could not possibly have seen him be really funny -- ''fall-off-your-chair funny'' as one of them put it. Fall-off-your-chair funny, they said, is reserved for those he trusts completely.</p>
        <p>In other words, Mr. Gore's charm is not only a gift he can bestow or withhold at will, but a compliment to the person who is being charmed. Put another way, those charmed by George W. Bush feel good about the encounter, but are not likely to feel it was their own special warmth or trustworthiness that made the connection possible. Whereas with Mr. Gore, friends and acquaintances typically do feel that his charm reflects well on them, and that it is to their credit to have drawn him out.</p>
        <p>When that happens, ''he'll let you into his soul,'' said Donna Armistead, Mr. Armistead's sister and a nurse living outside Nashville, who was Mr. Gore's first girlfriend. She, for one, says reporters are not solely to blame for Mr. Gore's image problems. ''He's not being himself,'' she said. ''He's going to have to take a deep breath and say, 'Look, this is me, and maybe I'm not an alpha male all the time.' He's such a human person,'' she said, and should not be afraid to show it.</p>
        <p>Friendly acquaintances like Mike Roche, who knew Mr. Gore in the Army and now does marketing for Sears in Chicago, are more apt than his closest friends to see any distortion in the way he comes across as a function of the fact that the camera just does not seem to like Mr. Gore as much as they do. ''I couldn't believe how stiff and phony he looked on television,'' Mr. Roche said. ''I never saw a phony second out of the guy.''</p>
        <p>But his friends are convinced, too, that Mr. Gore is still getting more than his fair share of bad press, a perception backed up by a recent study by the Pew Research Center and Project for Excellence in Journalism. Their analysis of news coverage from February through June showed that most stories about Mr. Gore -- 76 percent -- focused on two negative themes: that he is tainted by scandal and that he exaggerates. In contrast, the largest share of the Bush coverage -- 40 percent -- reflected Mr. Bush's own message that he is a different kind of politician.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's closest friend, Frank Hunger, a lawyer from Mississippi who was married to Mr. Gore's sister Nancy, began an interview with a tour of the Gore family photos on the wall in his Washington office: ''See, there he is in earth tones'' years before he was accused of being a slave to fashion consultants, he said.</p>
        <p>''I get terribly upset that he's been mischaracterized by people in the media world,'' Mr. Hunger went on. ''It sounds defensive to say he is funny, he is honest, but I get upset when I see some of these articles and some of these snide comments. I traveled with him in '92 and it was great and there was not one single story about stiff and awkward. What the hell happened?''</p>
        <p>In fact, until the Clinton-Gore administration's second term, Mr. Gore, who is himself a former reporter, had received overwhelmingly favorable notices, including a series of puff pieces about ''Gore chic'' in the months leading up to his 1988 presidential run.</p>
        <p>But now, Bob Somerby, a stand-up comic who roomed with Mr. Gore at Harvard, is so offended, so consumed, by what he sees as the unfairly harsh tone of the current coverage that he devotes a good bit of his time to rebutting Gore stories in a Web review he calls The Daily Howler.</p>
        <p>''It's sort of sad because the spin has overtaken reality,'' he said in an interview. ''The basic images I always challenge are the stuck-up kid from the hotel, the kid who's not from Tennessee, and the kid who's always trying to do everything right,'' he said. ''I don't think anyone should vote for him because he did farm chores, but he did do them. It's gotten to the point where when I see him now it's 'Oh, that is the guy I used to know.' When you hear something 100 times you sort of think it's true.''</p>
        <p>Lately, a number of Mr. Gore's friends have stopped talking to reporters altogether, which may have only compounded the problem, and contributed to their sense that the Al Gore they read about is nothing like the guy they know.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's childhood friend Gordon Thompson, a part-time farmer who works in a tire factory and has visited the vice president in Washington, said he, too, has just about given up on telling about their summers on the farm. Those stories do not fit the stereotype, he said, and almost never make the papers. Now he has caller ID, and screens for area codes like Washington's 202 that are overrun with reporters.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Gore's friends do talk, though, they frequently mention what a loyal guy he is. Edward Blair, an old running buddy in Tennessee, where he now is a United States marshal, remembers trying to talk Mr. Gore out of visiting someone they had known as kids who was in jail on a manslaughter charge. It was 1988 and he was running for president at the time. ''I said, 'How is this going to look?' But he said, ''If you were in jail, wouldn't you want me to visit you?' ''</p>
        <p>Yet they also leave the distinct impression that Mr. Gore does not share his emotions easily outside the Gore family circle.</p>
        <p>Even on the subject of how he really feels about the coverage. Sometimes, he jokes about it. Other times, he intellectualizes it, referring in a recent interview to ''the hostile takeover of journalism by deconstructionism. I'm not complaining about it, but the easy assumption that inner motive is obvious from context is often just plain wrong.''</p>
        <p>When asked about his friends' near-unanimous reaction to the way he is coming across, he smiled -- and quoted a lyric from a song by The Band, ''I don't have to speak, 'cause she defends me.''</p>
        <p>Then he said this: ''My friends are extremely loyal and I treasure them more than I can say. I appreciate the fact that they get their dander up. But we don't talk about it.''</p>
