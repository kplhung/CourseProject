        <p>For Rocco Mediate, today's final hole was the perfect time for a birdie. For Chris Perry, it was the worst time for a bogey.</p>
        <p>A two-shot swing on the 18th hole gave Mediate a dramatic one-stroke victory at the Buick Open, a triumph he will savor for many reasons. He shot a final-round six-under-par 66, a determined performance under pressure. He won over a strong field that included Tiger Woods, who settled for an 11th-place tie. And with his fourth career victory, Mediate showed the huge crowd at Warwick Hills Golf and Country Club that while Woods may be the world's No. 1 player, he does not corner the market on providing back-nine excitement.</p>
        <p>Shooting 20-under-par 268 for the tournament,  Mediate finished a stroke ahead of Perry, who shot 68 today, and three shots ahead of Hal Sutton.  With the $486,000 first-place check, Mediate soared to 16th on this year's PGA Tour money list with more than $1.23 million in earnings, while gaining the fourth victory of his 16-year career.</p>
        <p>For Woods and other top players, this weekend was a tuneup for the year's final major, the P.G.A. Championship, which begins Thursday in Louisville, Ky. But for Mediate, it was confirmation that when his game is right, he need not be intimidated by anyone.</p>
        <p>''I want to play where Tiger is playing,'' said Mediate, 37, who overcame major back surgery in 1994. ''I don't want to duck him. I'm not going to beat him for a career, but I beat him this week.  I'm not going to beat him for the next 10, 15 years. Forget it. I'm not even going to try. I think he is going to be the best player for a long time. But I beat him this week, and someone can beat him next week.''</p>
        <p>While Mediate celebrated, Woods looked forward to the P.G.A. Championship, where he will try to become the first player since Ben Hogan in 1953 to win three consecutive majors. Winning this weekend would not have upset Woods, but he came to Michigan to work on the type of shots he will need to win the P.G.A. at Valhalla Golf and  Country Club.</p>
        <p>After shooting a 68 today, Woods felt closer to reaching his peak. His scariest moment came at No. 13, when he felt a twinge in his left wrist after swinging hard at a ball that was lodged against a tree root. Woods dropped his club immediately and began to flex his wrist, but the pain subsided quickly and he completed his round showing no ill effects.</p>
        <p>''It hurt quite a bit,'' Woods said. ''I took out a root, but I hit the top edge of it and moved on.</p>
        <p>''It would've been nice to shoot lower scores, but I'm making progress. I'm not getting the most of my rounds right now. But winning next week would mean a lot. It would put a nice little cap at the end of my year.''</p>
        <p>It was Mediate who capped the tournament in style today. The outcome was decided on the par-4, 435-yard 18th, with Perry holding a one-stroke lead. After Mediate hit a superb drive, Perry drove into the rough, and his second shot came to rest just short of the green. Sensing an opportunity, Mediate hit an impressive 9-iron shot that landed on the green, 15 feet from the pin. Then Perry made a mistake, hitting a chip shot that rolled eight and a half feet past the pin, leaving him a difficult putt attempt for par.</p>
        <p>Mediate stood over the putt that would win him the tournament, a difficult 15-footer over a ridge.  He hit it smoothly and the ball broke into the cup for birdie. The gallery roared, but Perry had a chance to force a playoff if he made his putt, so Mediate showed no emotion.</p>
        <p>''I didn't want to do anything disrespectful, because Chris still had to play,'' Mediate said. ''I wasn't going to pump my fist. I don't do that. It doesn't do anything for me. We are professionals. If he makes it, we go to a playoff.''</p>
        <p>A playoff was not necessary. Perry's par attempt slid past the hole, and his knees sagged in disappointment. The huge galleries this weekend came mainly to see Woods, but it was Mediate who left with the biggest prize. ''I've been on the tour 16 years, 15 more years than I thought I would be on tour,'' Mediate said. ''I have also won four more times than I thought I would. I don't have the greatest swing, I don't hit the ball better than anybody, but I hit a lot of good shots when I wanted to today. It sure was a lot of fun.''</p>
        <p>CHIP SHOTS</p>
        <p>DUDLEY HART made eagle at the par-4, 457-yard 15th, making a 4-iron shot from the fairway from 190 yards. It was only the second eagle at No. 15 in tournament history. MARK O'MEARA had the other one in 1993.</p>
