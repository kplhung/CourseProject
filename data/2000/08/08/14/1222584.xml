        <p>Picture the scene this week on the convention floor in Los Angeles: Democratic delegates galore with banners and balloons, funny hats and confetti. And computers. And Palm Pilots, digital cameras, wireless beepers, ''smart cards'' and all sorts of other high-tech gadgets meant to showcase the party's technological prowess and burnish its party-of-the-future image.</p>
        <p>Even while the major party conventions have largely faded as big television and radio events, the Democratic Party is making a show of having the most plugged-in national convention in history, leaving no moment unrecorded and no delegate unconnected. In cyberspace, that is.</p>
        <p>A 360-degree camera will be streaming video images on the Democrats' Web site for the entire four-day convention.</p>
        <p>Everyone making a speech will be required to participate in an online chat immediately afterward. When the cry rings out, ''The great state of Tennessee casts its votes for . . .'' those votes will be recorded by one of 56 Apple iMac computers scattered across the convention floor. And each delegate is being given a card that can be used at any of the more than 100 computer kiosks scattered at the convention and at Los Angeles hotels to get late-breaking information from party officials and to talk to other delegates.</p>
        <p>''We've basically wired the entire city of Los Angeles,'' said Naz Nageer, director of technology for the Democratic National Convention Committee. ''It's our 'e-mersion' coverage. We're on the frontier of something big; we are in the space of the future. We've got technological diversity here.''</p>
        <p>For the Democrats -- who have a far more extensive technological display planned than what the Republicans offered in Philadelphia -- the high-tech gadgetry serves purposes both practical and political.</p>
        <p>It connects disparate delegates in the nation's most sprawling city and is a way to communicate with them on issues ranging from the party's daily talking points to scheduling changes and restaurant reservations.</p>
        <p>But, more subtly, the gadgetry sends the message that the party embraces technology and, by implication, the future.</p>
        <p>''It's mainly a demonstration,'' said Adam Clayton Powell III, vice president of technology for the Freedom Forum, a nonprofit foundation. ''It becomes a showcase of technology and a way to make the party look very 21st century. It means we won't have pictures of delegates sitting in their seats reading the newspapers. The party would rather have them looking at their Palm Pilots.''</p>
        <p>And for some, this technology is also a way to keep delegates in line. ''All this technology is not so much to solicit opinions of delegates as it is to tell them what to do and what to say,'' said Marion Just, research director at the Joan Shorenstein Center at Harvard University. ''This certainly will help delegates get the message of the day -- or of the hour -- and provides an opportunity for the convention to speak with one voice to the media.''</p>
        <p>The technological display, which is being offered free by many high-tech companies, involves gadgets both in real space and in cyberspace.</p>
        <p>More than 100 seven-foot-high kiosks will connect delegates and anyone else to the Internet and to special convention Web sites. The kiosks, 12 on the convention floor and the rest at delegate hotels, contain easy-to-use computers with touch screens instead of mouses.</p>
        <p>The main Web site is DNC411, a delegates-only part of the main site (www.Dems2000.com) that is a way for delegates to get information online at any kiosk rather than having to carry around sheets of paper.</p>
        <p>''All the computers reinforce the image that this is the party of the future,'' said Michael Cornfield, research director of the Democracy Online Project at George Washington University. ''There really is no other purpose for them.''</p>
