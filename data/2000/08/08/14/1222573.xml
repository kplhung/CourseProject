        <p>It would have been much more pleasurable to spend a rare sunny morning here in a rocking chair along Broadway poring over The Daily Racing Form. But an important part of the Saratoga meet for breeders, owners and racetrack executives is the Jockey Club round table, which takes place annually and is often a gloomy affair conducted at a comatose pace in a darkened hotel ballroom.</p>
        <p>Yet an upbeat business mood prevailed yesterday as the thoroughbred racing industry, with a more or less league office in place, crisply set out an agenda for horse racing. Like all league meetings, there was good news: a new televised series of races for 2-year-olds that will not only provide purses of $2.9 million and potential bonus money of $1.3 million to their owners but also introduce next year's Triple Crown stars over seven heats to racing fans.</p>

        <p>It would have been much more pleasurable to spend a rare sunny morning here in a rocking chair along Broadway poring over The Daily Racing Form. But an important part of the Saratoga meet for breeders, owners and racetrack executives is the Jockey Club round table, which takes place annually and is often a gloomy affair conducted at a comatose pace in a darkened hotel ballroom.</p>
        <p>Yet an upbeat business mood prevailed yesterday as the thoroughbred racing industry, with a more or less league office in place, crisply set out an agenda for horse racing. Like all league meetings, there was good news: a new televised series of races for 2-year-olds that will not only provide purses of $2.9 million and potential bonus money of $1.3 million to their owners but also introduce next year's Triple Crown stars over seven heats to racing fans.</p>
        <p>There was troubling news: substantive recommendations to strengthen drug testing to weed out cheaters, which one owner, Stuart S. Janney III, said should be addressed in the open so the public, as well as trainers, jockeys and owners, know without doubt that a horse running is doing so honestly. Janney, the owner of the 1998 Travers Stakes winner Coronado's Quest, acknowledged that lax regulation, new performance-enhancing drugs and unscrupulous veterinarians and trainers had contributed to a lack of confidence in racing's integrity in recent years.</p>
        <p>In fact, in recent weeks, Bob Baffert had a horse in California test positive for morphine -- though Baffert, a veteran Triple Crown trainer, contends that the small amount could have come from any incidental contact. But Janney, who headed a task force on the subject of drugs, called for more vigilance, with measures like camera surveillance of competitors on race day.</p>
        <p>''Ensuring that cheaters do not win our greatest races,'' he said. ''That undeserving horses are not crowned champions and that all our effort and hard work to enhance our sport is not destroyed by compromising our standards and integrity.''</p>
        <p>But perhaps best of all for the racing enthusiasts who wagered a record $14.4 billion in 1999 on horse races in North America was that there was plenty of talk about new technology and marketing plans to make Internet delivery part of winning new fans and helping existing ones.</p>
        <p>One of the most promising initiatives is perhaps one of the most puzzling. The National Thoroughbred Racing Association, which has finally consolidated some amount of power, hired IBM Global Services, which has studied the industry for the past year, to come up with initiatives to update technologies and advance access to the sport. Though the consultants initially determined that thoroughbred racing still does not have enough fans, they saw enough potential to want to finance future projects as a partner.</p>
        <p>''We would like to negotiate a long-term contract that we believe would be a win-win situation,'' said Rob Law, a senior consultant for IBM.</p>
        <p>There remain many obstacles for horse racing to return as a major player in the crowded sports landscape. The conglomerates of Churchill Downs Inc. and the M. I. Entertainment Corporation, which is led by the industrialist Frank Stronach, are battling to acquire racetracks. Smaller, independent track operators have felt squeezed out. The Internet Gambling Prohibition Act was narrowly defeated recently in Congress. It needs approval if simulcast betting and account wagering -- the staples of wagering revenue -- are to continue.</p>
        <p>But as recent developments and the round-table discussion demonstrated, the industry is moving, if not always in harmony, in a productive direction. The Breeders' Cup Championship, now in its 17th year and by far the most successful venture in horse racing in modern times, has consolidated with the N.T.R.A., and the two entities will probably merge within three years.</p>
        <p>''It made sense to have the championship of our sport under the umbrella of the league office,'' explained D. G. Van Clief Jr., president of the Breeders' Cup, which brings the best horses from around the world together for a day of competition. ''It means more money and focus on building up the game.''</p>
        <p>Less intramural skirmishing also means that more energy can be put into arranging a natural marriage between a sport with true interactive capabilities and a population already doing plenty of commerce by computer and on the Internet. Skilled handicapping of horses leads to financial rewards for selecting winners, which are delivered as horses gallop around an oval to the finish line.</p>
        <p>As the drug testing discussion illustrates, the industry has done well at keeping the performance on the racetrack at a high standard. Now, it's time for the business plans to do the same.</p>
