        <p>It was the Al and Rob show, an unlikely new comedy duo now making occasional appearances on the campaign trail to the White House. Starring Vice President Al Gore, a politician with a famously wooden public demeanor, and Rob Reiner, the actor and director known for sly satire, the team came to the Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital here to talk about the serious subject of children without medical insurance.</p>
        <p>But as the two stood side by side in the hospital atrium, swapping turns with the microphone in a discussion with doctors and parents, the topic was at times overtaken by two other objectives of the Gore campaign: making Mr. Gore more likable, and finding ways to attack George W. Bush without turning voters off.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reiner took on both challenges today, introducing Mr. Gore as ''a good man,'' and then, almost beseechingly, assuring the audience that Mr. Gore does indeed possess a sense of humor. ''He's a fun man,'' he said. ''We have laughs together.''</p>
        <p>Then, as Mr. Gore plowed into a long description of how some states have thrown up bureaucratic barriers to enrolling children in government-financed health care, Mr. Reiner cut in with deadpan timing.  ''Would one of those states be Texas?'' he asked, all mock innocence.</p>
        <p>''If it isn't, you don't have to say.''</p>
        <p>Embracing the straight man role, Mr. Gore replied, ''If it is, can I still not say?''</p>
        <p>For Mr. Gore's aides, the repartee was a welcome surprise, a moment to get in a subtle jab at Mr. Bush while showing their candidate as a man who, if not exactly George Burns, is at least capable of adding a human touch to policy jargon.</p>
        <p>In recent months Mr. Gore's friends have repeatedly expressed frustration at his inability to project a certain lightness of being that seems to come so easily for Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>During a private lunch, Mr. Gore and Mr. Reiner watched film of Mr. Gore shot by Spike Jonze, the director of the movie ''Being John Malkovich.'' The film, paid for by the Democratic National Committee, is said to show a more appealing side to Mr. Gore, and Mr. Reiner, the director of ''The American President,'' gave it a gushing review. The public, he said, needs to see this kind of film, perhaps even this week at the Democratic convention.</p>
        <p>''He's got a great sense of humor,'' he said.</p>
        <p>As part of the campaign's quest to soften his image, Mr. Gore has toned down his criticism of Mr. Bush. ''I pledged not to make any negative personal attacks, and I won't,'' Mr. Gore said in a local television interview today. The same cannot be said of Mr. Gore's press aides and surrogates such as Mr. Reiner, who did not disappoint. He sailed into passionate attacks on Mr. Bush that were oddly reminiscent of the diatribes he once delivered against Richard M. Nixon when he played Archie Bunker's liberal son-in-law in the 1970's sitcom ''All in the Family.''</p>
        <p>''The other side talks about being the party of diversity and the party of inclusion,'' he said here at one point. ''How do they figure this? This is what I want to know. Unless they define diversity as two guys at the head of the ticket that are from two different oil companies.''</p>
        <p>He was even more exercised when  Mr. Gore's aides had him meet with reporters. Waving his arms, talking a mile a minute, Mr. Reiner called Mr. Bush ''a hypocrite of staggering proportions.'' He chided Mr. Bush for having ''the audacity'' to call himself a champion of children when it is Mr. Gore who has proposed spending $42 billion to provide health care to another one million uninsured children.</p>
        <p>By contrast, he and Gore advisers said, Mr. Bush has resisted efforts to expand government health care programs to hundreds of thousands of poor children in Texas.</p>
        <p>At one moment, though, Mr. Reiner's impassioned advocacy seemed to get the better of him. Mr. Reiner asserted that Mr. Gore was one of the three most qualified men to run for president ''in our lifetimes.'' The others, he said, were Lyndon B. Johnson and Mr. Nixon, presidents perhaps best known for leading the nation through the traumas of Vietnam and Watergate. ''Al Gore, of those three, is the most qualified,'' he said.</p>
        <p>When reporters burst into laughter at the unlikely comparison of Mr. Gore to Mr. Nixon, Mr. Reiner tried hard to backpedal. ''Don't just print the Nixon part,'' he begged, far, far too late.</p>
