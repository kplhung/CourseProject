        <p>The injury was supposed to be minor, one of those day-to-day situations that are so common in training camp, where everyone struggles to remain healthy. But Mike Barrow had not practiced since he sprained his right knee in practice Aug. 2 in a collision in the end zone with safety Sam Garnes and wide receiver Ike Hilliard. Finally, Barrow returned to practice today, a day ahead of schedule and just in time to provide some relief to the Giants.</p>
        <p>Barrow's status gained even more importance Friday when Pete Monty, his backup as the middle linebacker, broke his thumb against Jacksonville. The injury is expected to sideline Monty for two to three weeks, probably ruling him out for the Sept. 3 opener.</p>

        <p>The injury was supposed to be minor, one of those day-to-day situations that are so common in training camp, where everyone struggles to remain healthy. But Mike Barrow had not practiced since he sprained his right knee in practice Aug. 2 in a collision in the end zone with safety Sam Garnes and wide receiver Ike Hilliard. Finally, Barrow returned to practice today, a day ahead of schedule and just in time to provide some relief to the Giants.</p>
        <p>Barrow's status gained even more importance Friday when Pete Monty, his backup as the middle linebacker, broke his thumb against Jacksonville. The injury is expected to sideline Monty for two to three weeks, probably ruling him out for the Sept. 3 opener.</p>
        <p>Because the Giants practiced in lightweight pads, Coach Jim Fassel could not really tell how Barrow's unprotected knee held up. But Barrow worked as much as anyone during the one practice session and moved well, Fassel said. Barrow has missed two games and admits he has fallen behind his teammates as he adjusts to a new defensive system. Barrow is playing middle linebacker in the Giants' 4-3 defense, the first time since his rookie year in 1993 that he has been at that position in this type of alignment.</p>
        <p>''I believe in working out,'' he said. ''I believe in practicing and I believe in perfect practice makes you better, so any time you're not practicing, you're missing that opportunity. I believe once I get out there and make it happen, I believe I can redeem that time.''</p>
        <p>Barrow, 30, was the Giants' marquee signing this off-season, agreeing to a six-year, $24 million contract to replace Corey Widmer. They plan on Barrow being the key to a quicker defense that will use the blitz more often, but have yet to see him in a game.</p>
        <p>New but Not Unknown</p>
        <p>Joe Montgomery was asked to recall the last time he played fullback before Friday night and took no time in giving a telling answer.</p>
        <p>''In college I did it for one year, but every time I did it I'd break away for 30 yards and they'd say, 'O.K., put him back there,' '' said Montgomery, a second-round pick out of Ohio State last year who was primarily a tailback in college.</p>
        <p>Montgomery started at fullback Friday against the Jacksonville Jaguars and was told by Coach Jim Fassel that he would see more time there. The first-round pick Ron Dayne has carried the ball 17 times in each of the two preseason games.</p>
        <p>''Whatever they want me to do, I'll do,'' said Montgomery, who said he needed to adjust to the extra blocking involved and said he had not practiced as a fullback since joining the Giants.</p>
        <p>''I told him coming out to practice, 'I'm just trying to figure out ways to get you on the field,' '' Fassel said.</p>
        <p>Montgomery has had an awkward training camp. After leading the Giants in rushing with a modest 348 yards in an injury-filled rookie season, he entered camp knowing Dayne was the ballyhooed newcomer.</p>
        <p>Then, Montgomery was not pleased that a cut lip caused him to miss the Giants' first preseason game and avoid contact in practice last week. Fassel has maintained that Dayne and Montgomery are competing for the starting tailback job, but conceded today that he had planned to use Montgomery as a fullback even before Greg Comella's back injury prevented him from playing Friday.</p>
        <p>Montgomery prefers to look at the situation as an opportunity to get more snaps. ''I don't care if they have me kicking field goals if I can make the playoffs,'' he said.</p>
        <p>A Play to Remember</p>
        <p>On his first day back at practice, the rookie Jack Golden could not escape his infamous misplay Friday night. His rookie teammate Fred Lewis intercepted a pass near the goal line in the waning seconds and began running. Golden, who said he was trying to take Lewis to the ground to avoid a fumble, instead jarred the ball loose when he tried a tackle. The ball rolled into the end zone, where Jacksonville tight end Brandon Christenson smothered it for a game-winning touchdown in a 16-13 Jaguars victory.</p>
        <p>Today, reminders came in the form of television cameras, tape recorders and playful teammates.</p>
        <p>''I've been thinking about it a lot,''  Golden said with a faint smile. ''In life sometimes people try to do the right thing and it don't always happen that way. This is one of those mistakes that I made in professional football that I'll be reminded of.''</p>
        <p>Word traveled quickly. When Golden returned to his room here at 4:30 a.m. Saturday after the Giants' charter flight home, he had 17 messages waiting for him on his answering machine. Five were from his agent and 10 from his mother.</p>
        <p>''It's the first time I've ever known of two free-agent rookies were on 24-hour CNN news for the Faux Pas Play of the Day,'' Fassel said.</p>
        <p>Mike Barrow said he spoke with Golden after the game in an attempt to ease his guilt.</p>
        <p>''I want him to forgive himself and then move on,'' Barrow said. ''You can't become a prisoner of your past because you're not going to live today.''</p>
        <p>Barrow said he was involved in a similarly embarrassing play in a regular-season game three years ago, playing with the Carolina Panthers. Minnesota quarterback Brad Johnson threw a pass that was deflected back to Johnson. ''Instead of just breaking down and tackling him, I was trying to kill him,'' Barrow said, ''and I missed him and he ran around me and scored.''</p>
