        <p>The ''Hang Suharto!'' protesters were out in the streets, as always. But so was a small rally demanding clean air, another involving a local land dispute and another promoting breast-feeding.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, the streets of Jakarta were mostly quiet as Parliament met this last week -- an indication, perhaps, that despite Indonesia's daunting problems, there is hope here for a more ordered and cohesive future.</p>
        <p>''It's not over yet,'' cautioned a local journalist. But with another week to go, this has been the first major political event since President Suharto was driven from office two and a half years ago that has not been riven by chaos and bloodshed.</p>
        <p>''It's almost surreal,'' said a diplomat who has in the past watched Jakarta burning and residents fleeing. ''The popular vote is out there on the streets. The popular vote is, give this government a chance. People are speaking by not speaking.''</p>
        <p>Clean air and breast-feeding are the kinds of issues that have been drowned in the past by tidal waves of political rage.</p>
        <p>That is not to say that everything here is calm. The politically crucial Parliament session has been as tumultuous and passionate in its way as the street demonstrations of the past. The session was to focus on updating the country's patchwork 1945 Constitution, but in fact there is little evidence that the people's business is being addressed.</p>
        <p>''We're watching a power struggle in Parliament,'' said Dennis Heffernan, a director of Van Zorge, Heffernan &amp; Associates, a political consulting firm. ''It's very primitive from an issue standpoint, but it's being done without gunpowder or even fisticuffs. And if that ain't a giant step toward democracy . . .''</p>
        <p>One thing that has changed is that the opposition now has a voice inside government, he said. ''The streets are quiet because the politicians in the halls of power have some constituency, some basis among average people in this country,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Last year, for the first time in half a century, the Indonesian people voted in a free election, choosing among candidates for Parliament who had not been vetted by the party in power. But the winners were elected to an institution that had little experience in democratic give-and-take.</p>
        <p>The battle inside Parliament now involves raw ambition as emerging power blocs jostle for dominance in a nation that is working out new alignments on every front after 32 years of one-man rule by Mr. Suharto.</p>
        <p>The session is a sort of D-Day in a concerted multiparty attack on President Abdurrahman Wahid, a compromise leader with few political defenses. The parliamentary coalition of opposing parties that chose him as president 10 months ago has mostly turned against him, and he finds himself racing back and forth along the clifftop fighting off their attacks.</p>
        <p>The dirty little secret of the battle is that despite loud talk of impeachment, few of his opponents actually want to depose him. His most prominent challengers -- Amien Rais, who leads an Islamic coalition, and Akbar Tandjung, who leads Mr. Suharto's former ruling party -- realize that they could not hold a government together now, political experts said.</p>
        <p>So Mr. Wahid, who remains personally popular, is still the most acceptable figure among the warring parties. And although Indonesians both inside and outside Parliament have become exasperated by his erratic and often incompetent administration, he commands respect for his tolerant and democratic vision.</p>
        <p>''Of course, the vehemence we're seeing in Parliament is fabricated,'' said Wimar Witoelar, a leading political commentator. ''The game these people are playing is toward positioning for the next election. They are feeling things out and sounding out the other guy and seeing how it will play in 2004. Are they going to be Muslims or nationalists or pragmatists? They will play any game as long as they can come out of it in a better political position.''</p>
        <p>In the tumult, most of the substance has been drained from the parliamentary session. With every issue now so politicized, and with the session preoccupied by infighting, most political experts now say any constitutional changes are likely to be postponed.</p>
        <p>Instead, personal ambitions aside, the session has become a forum for working out the dynamics of an infant democracy. It is a struggle for dominance between the executive and legislative branches, which in the past were both under the unquestioned control of Mr. Suharto.</p>
        <p>''They have never had a system of checks and balances before,'' the diplomat said. By ganging up on Mr. Wahid, the disparate parties have sought to assert the dominance of Parliament over the presidency.</p>
        <p>Last month they jeered Mr. Wahid at a special session they called to demand an explanation for his unpopular dismissal of two of his cabinet ministers. He stubbornly refused to explain himself, asserting the constitutional division of power.</p>
        <p>Last week they forced him to hand over day-to-day government administration to Vice President Megawati Sukarnoputri. Having done so, Mr. Wahid shifted immediately into his familiar mode of bob and weave, insisting that he had given only duties, not power, to the vice president.</p>
        <p>So Parliament is now demanding the right to codify the arrangement in law, and the president is resisting.</p>
        <p>The political nature of the standoff is underscored by the fact that nobody expects Mrs. Megawati to be a better administrator than Mr. Wahid. Passive and seemingly uninterested in politics or administration, Mrs. Megawati has been a notably absent figure as vice president.</p>
        <p>''People say the trouble with Mega is knowing what she wants,'' a presidential confidant said acidly, using her popular nickname. ''And I suspect she doesn't know herself.''</p>
        <p>She has taken little action on the major assignment Mr. Wahid gave her last year, to try to bring peace to a secessionist movement in remote Irian Jaya and to the Maluku Islands, where religious fighting has taken more than 3,000 lives. Moreover, people close to the president say that in the past she declined the kind of arrangement that has now been announced.</p>
        <p>The arrangement has been pushed in Parliament by her opponents as well as his, apparently as a sort of Trojan horse in the hope that she can be manipulated, some experts said.</p>
        <p>But recently she has come to demand a bigger role, apparently in part at least for personal reasons.</p>
        <p>According to a number of politicians, she has been irritated by what she sees as the president's dismissive attitude toward her. And she was reportedly angered in April when the president fired Laksamana Sukardi, a cabinet minister who is one of her closest advisers.</p>
        <p>''That was the straw that broke Mega's back,'' Mr. Witoelar said. ''Without that incident, maybe Mega would still be content to be a sort of passive partner. But she either got very angry or somebody reminded her to be very angry.''</p>
        <p>Now that she has gotten what she demanded, one cabinet minister said, the burden is on Mrs. Megawati to show that she can govern.</p>
        <p>''Her problem is to shed the image of a housewife, of uncertainty, of incompetence,'' he said. ''I would probably give her the proverbial 100 days, see how she does.''</p>
        <p>The new partnership at the top could be made to work, he said, both because Mrs. Megawati has surrounded herself with a strong circle of managers and because Mr. Wahid could still appoint a sort of chief of staff to report to both of them.</p>
        <p>But unless the coming week explodes in some unexpected way on the streets or inside Parliament, the most important event will come after the legislature adjourns. At that point, Mr. Wahid says, he will appoint a new cabinet and a new team to manage the flagging economy.</p>
        <p>The unwieldy and feuding cabinet in place now is the product of the political deals he made in October to win office. With the coalition fractured, experts said, he will have more leeway this time to select his ministers on the basis of merit.</p>
        <p>It is this new government lineup -- much more than the political excitement of the moment -- that may determine the success or failure of Mr. Wahid's struggling government.</p>
