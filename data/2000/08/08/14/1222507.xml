        <p>After a lengthy delay, NBC will announce this week that it has acquired the rights to ''Chains of Love,'' a reality show that will literally chain four men to one woman for a week.</p>
        <p>NBC has also acquired the rights to a hidden-camera show that will begin as a special, but which NBC has the option of turning into a series. In ''Sweet Revenge,'' a contestant will be offered a chance to get back at a friend or family member for some perceived offense by setting him or her up for some embarrassment on a hidden camera.</p>

        <p>After a lengthy delay, NBC will announce this week that it has acquired the rights to ''Chains of Love,'' a reality show that will literally chain four men to one woman for a week.</p>
        <p>NBC has also acquired the rights to a hidden-camera show that will begin as a special, but which NBC has the option of turning into a series. In ''Sweet Revenge,'' a contestant will be offered a chance to get back at a friend or family member for some perceived offense by setting him or her up for some embarrassment on a hidden camera.</p>
        <p>NBC has agreed to buy 16 episodes of ''Chains of Love,'' which will likely run in five-episode segments, after one initial special. That means NBC has bought the rights to three separate editions of the series, which NBC is internally calling ''Dating Game Meets Survivor.'' In the show, the woman discards the men one at a time and picks the winner.</p>
        <p>Both shows come from the Dutch production company Endemol. The deal has been formally finished for some time, an executive associated with Endemol said. Endemol had negotiated to retain most of the control over the shows, as it did for its first reality series, ''Big Brother,'' which has occasionally seen some of its cast members become controversial figures on CBS this summer.</p>
        <p>According to the executive associated with Endemol, the production house has sought even more control over ''Chains of Love.'' Shirley Powell, the spokeswoman for NBC's entertainment division, said, ''I'm assuming we'll have more control than CBS had, especially after what's happened with 'Big Brother'.'' In the event of an on-screen fiasco, the networks could be in a far more vulnerable position than the production house.</p>
        <p>But Endemol's negotiating position has been strengthened by its long list of reality formats, as many as 60, which are much in demand at the networks. The shows are not only being looked on as possible breakthrough hits, like ''Survivor'' has been for CBS, but also as possible alternative programming if Hollywood unions representing writers and actors go on strike next summer, as is currently feared.</p>
        <p>Ms. Powell sad: ''Everybody is making contingency plans. We've scheduled a special strike contingency planning meeting.''</p>
