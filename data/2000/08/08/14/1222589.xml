        <p>Delegates Are Liberal Face Of Democrats, Poll Finds  Most of the 4,339 delegates at the Democratic National Convention think of themselves as moderates, but their views on issues from affirmative action to an activist federal government are more liberal than those of the public or even Democratic voters generally, a New York Times/CBS News Poll shows.</p>

        <p>The Democratic platform, like its Republican counterpart, tries to reach voters in the middle, calling for better schools, stricter border controls, expanded global trade, a stronger military and the death penalty. But the platforms sharply diverge on issues like taxes, Social Security, financing for public schools, gay rights and workers' rights.</p>

        <p>Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, while seeking to minimize his differences with Vice President Al Gore on some of the leading issues of the campaign, revealed a potentially contentious disagreement in their views about raising the retirement age for Social Security and Medicare. Mr. Lieberman said any debate on keeping the system solvent should consider raising the retirement age.</p>

        <p>Bush Defends Cheney's Deal  Gov. George W. Bush defended the generous retirement deal that Dick Cheney received from his former employer. But Democrats questioned the message it sent to working people, especially since Republicans have resisted increasing the minimum wage.</p>

        <p>Reform Party's 2 Nominees  The associates of the presidential nominees of a split Reform Party, Patrick J. Buchanan and John Hagelin, plotted legal strategies to seize the $12.6 million in federal campaign money that awaits the true nominee once a court settles the issue.</p>

        <p>Life After Welfare  Schuyler County was the first county in Illinois to be ''welfare-free'' and one of the nation's first. The end of cash assistance resulted not just from a strong economy, but also from hard work by local welfare officials. Life is not easy for the former welfare recipients, but they say they prefer earning paychecks to welfare.</p>

        <p>New Jersey Assesses Toll Of a Persistent Storm  Saturday's thunderstorm dropped 14 inches of rain on Jefferson Township in north-central New Jersey. The damage included 300 homes flooded, several bridges and roads washed out, downed trees, ruined cars and boats and two dams gone. No one was killed, but the damage in Jefferson Township and in surrounding Morris, Sussex, Passaic, Bergen, Warren, Essex and Hunterdon Counties may run into hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>

        <p>Reclusive Gunman Had Arsenal  Arthur Alalouf, the Brooklyn man who wounded four police officers on Saturday before he was killed in a shootout, had lived for years as something of a hermit before he unraveled, the police said. Neighbors said he made them nervous. A search of his home after the police killed him turned up an armory of pistols, rifles and shotguns in his basement and samurai swords in a closet. He also had knives and daggers, the police said, and boxes upon boxes of ammunition.</p>

        <p>Worries Over Energy Demands  The surging demand for electricity is so intense in New York that at least 13 power plant proposals have been made recently for the city. Blackouts, equipment failures and soaring energy costs have raised awareness about the delicate balance of electricity supply and demand. Air quality, energy reliability and electricity costs are all at stake in a debate that is likely to be influenced by politics and money.</p>

        <p>Early Tire Complaints Revealed  Ford released documents showing that by 1997 Bridgestone/Firestone had begun receiving many complaints of injuries and property damage involving Firestone tires that were not recalled until last Wednesday. Many of those claims were sent to Bridgestone by vehicle owners from 1997 to 1999, but the tire maker did not tell Ford, whose new vehicles, particularly the Ford Explorer, are equipped with two-thirds of the recalled tires.</p>
