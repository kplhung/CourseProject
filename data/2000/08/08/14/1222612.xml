        <p>While the United States Senate race in New York is the biggest drawing card for the November election, several high-pitched, energetic contests are also generating a lot of interest in next month's primary.</p>
        <p>The Sept. 12 primary includes races that range from grudge matches to breakups of formerly close allies to battles between young insurgents and well-entrenched incumbents. There are even a few attempts by former elected officials to achieve a comeback.</p>
        <p>The races run the spectrum, from contests for the United States Congress, the State Senate and the Assembly to elections for the job of district leader within the political parties and various judicial positions.</p>
        <p>''In many respects, this is a rare election year,'' said Hakeem Jeffries, a lawyer running against Assemblyman Roger L. Green in the Democratic primary in Brooklyn. ''For the first time in a long time, voters all across the city will have choices up and down the ballot on races where you have serious challenges.''</p>
        <p>Although this is an election year that is garnering widespread public attention, voter turnout in the primary is expected to be relatively light. After all, there is little statewide attention being paid to the primary, and candidates for local offices say they are setting their sights on getting to the polls those voters whom they consider likely to vote for them.</p>
        <p>As a result, campaigns throughout New York City are now devoting the bulk of their energy to identifying voters who have indicated, through telephone canvassing, a preference for their candidate.</p>
        <p>''Targeting voters is always a concern in a race where turnout is expected to be low,'' said Scott Levinson, president of the Advance Group, a Democratic political consulting organization. ''For most political campaigns, the issue is not increasing turnout. It's turning out the votes that you think are for your candidate.''</p>
        <p>Typically, Congressional races tend to be less competitive because the incumbents often face opponents who are decidedly less well known with little chance of unseating them. But this year's primary features races in the Democratic Party in which the challengers are either elected officials with years of incumbency in their own right or candidates who gave incumbents a close race in earlier elections.</p>
        <p>In the Bronx, for example, Representative Eliot L. Engel is facing a challenge from State Senator Larry B. Seabrook in a race in which the Democratic Party organization in the district has for the first time endorsed the insurgent rather than the veteran Congressman.</p>
        <p>Brooklyn is the scene of three primaries for Congressional seats. Major R. Owens, a nine-term incumbent, is engaged in a bitter battle with his onetime protegee, City Councilwoman Una S. T. Clarke, in a race that has already become hot-tempered. Representative Anthony D. Weiner, a freshman in the House, faces a challenge from City Councilman Noach Dear. And Barry Ford, a lawyer who ran for Congress two years ago, is once again taking on Representative Edolphus Towns, a longtime incumbent, who won re-election to the House in 1998 with just 52 percent of the vote.</p>
        <p>Outside the city, on Long Island, Representative Michael P. Forbes, a Democrat who left the Republican Party a year ago, is being challenged in the Democratic primary by Regina Seltzer, a former town board member in Brookhaven.</p>
        <p>At the same time, there are dozens of more races, for the State Senate, the Assembly and district leader positions in the political parties that are equally competitive.</p>
        <p>In some cases, the contests are driven by the city's term limit laws, which for the first time will prevent dozens of City Council members from running for re-election next year. And some are trying to secure their futures a year early, by running for seats in the Legislature before their Council terms end.</p>
        <p>The competitiveness of the primary races in New York City is a result of the lopsided advantage enjoyed by the Democratic Party, which outpaces the Republican Party in voter registration by nine to one. As a result, winning the Democratic primary is often tantamount to election. But in the State Senate, there are still several highly competitive races in November, when the Democrats will be seeking to gain the six seats needed to control that body.</p>
        <p>These primary campaigns seem to offer few ideological themes, even with all the fervor surrounding them. In most cases, the candidates running against each other generally agree on most major issues. Therefore, much of the campaign themes center on more personal issues, like leadership style and commitment to the voters.</p>
        <p>''The politics of primaries are far more about personal characteristics, and there aren't broad differences on issues like choice and the death penalty,'' said Jeffrey B. Plaut, a partner at the Global Strategy Group, a political consulting concern that is working with the campaigns of Congressmen Towns and Owens.</p>
        <p>''The candidates in primaries tend to talk more about such issues as experience, race and job performance than they do about philosophical issues,'' he said. ''They become very personal and very nasty, very quickly.'' In the Congressional races, for example, the candidates seem to be distributing news releases and sending e-mail messages almost daily in an effort to chastise their opponents about everything from failing to vote to ethical lapses.</p>
        <p>In political accusations, the campaign of Congressman Owens broke some new ground. Mr. Owens went to the Board of Elections seeking to get his rival, Ms. Clarke, thrown off the ballot. He contended that she was not eligible to oppose him in the Democratic primary because she voted in a United States election in 1982 before she was a citizen.</p>
        <p>Ms. Clarke, who was born in Jamaica, produced documents at a board hearing recently showing that she became a citizen before she voted in the United States, and the case was dismissed.</p>
        <p>Term limits are also driving other races. City Councilman Martin Malave-Dilan, a Brooklyn Democrat, is running for the Assembly seat now held by Darryl C. Towns, who was once the councilman's close friend.</p>
        <p>Then there are those who miss elected office enough to try to return to public service. In Manhattan, a former councilman, Adam Clayton Powell 4th, the son of the legendary Harlem Congressman, is working to defeat Assemblyman Nelson Antonio Denis in a race in East Harlem.</p>
        <p>In Brooklyn, a former state senator, Robert DiCarlo, is seeking to regain the Senate seat he lost four years ago, in a rarity in New York City -- a Republican primary. Mr. DiCarlo is running against Charles Capetanakis for the seat now held by Vincent Gentile, a Democrat, in a district that includes the Bay Ridge section of the borough.</p>
        <p>And in the Bronx, Pedro Espada Jr., a former state senator, is running against David Rosado, the incumbent in a closely watched rematch of the State Senate race two years ago in which Mr. Rosado won with about 55 percent of the vote, an uncommonly weak showing for an incumbent in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>The Democratic Party chairmen in two of the city's boroughs will face competitive contests in Assembly races next month. In Brooklyn, Assemblyman Clarence Norman Jr. is facing a rematch in the Democratic primary with James E. Davis. Mr. Davis is a police officer who ran against Mr. Norman in 1998, and lost by just 580 votes.</p>
        <p>The Democratic chairman on Staten Island, John W. Lavelle, is in his first attempt at elective office in a race to succeed Elizabeth A. Connelly, who announced in April that she would not seek re-election after 27 years in the Assembly. Mr. Lavelle is facing a primary election against Raymond G. Jorgensen, a Democratic district leader in the 59th Assembly District and a shop steward with Local 1180 of the Communications Workers of America.</p>
