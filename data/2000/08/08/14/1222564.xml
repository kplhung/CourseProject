        <p>Editorial says proceeds established by German government and German companies as restitution for victims of Holocaust should also go to Gypsies, who were also exterminated along with Jews during Holocaust; says fund administrators should take special care to see that group is not slighted again (S)</p>

        <p>Gypsies and Jews were the only two groups that the Nazi regime sought to exterminate completely. Six million Jews were murdered, and perhaps half of Europe's one million Gypsies. Yet of the $60 billion the German government has paid in reparations since World War II to Holocaust victims, only a tiny percentage has gone to Gypsies. The German government and German companies who employed slave or forced labor recently set up a $5 billion fund for these workers and other victims. Gypsies are eligible, and the fund also provides $12 million for social programs to benefit them. But the fund administrators must take special care to see that the money reaches Gypsies, lest this group be slighted again.</p>
        <p>Gypsies, who call themselves Roma, were left uncompensated after World War II largely because of their low social status. After the war, Chancellor Konrad Adenauer of West Germany invited the government of the new nation of Israel and leaders of Jewish organizations worldwide to negotiate for restitution. The organization they established, the Claims Conference, had political clout and could find victims and administer payments. The Gypsies, long the objects of scorn in Europe, had no organization and no political champions. West German laws discriminated against them. The German Supreme Court in 1956 even ruled that Gypsies deported before 1943 were taken because they were antisocial and so were not entitled to compensation.</p>

        <p>Gypsies, who call themselves Roma, were left uncompensated after World War II largely because of their low social status. After the war, Chancellor Konrad Adenauer of West Germany invited the government of the new nation of Israel and leaders of Jewish organizations worldwide to negotiate for restitution. The organization they established, the Claims Conference, had political clout and could find victims and administer payments. The Gypsies, long the objects of scorn in Europe, had no organization and no political champions. West German laws discriminated against them. The German Supreme Court in 1956 even ruled that Gypsies deported before 1943 were taken because they were antisocial and so were not entitled to compensation.</p>
        <p>The new fund is mainly for those pressed into labor, principally non-Jews from Eastern and Central Europe. The negotiators are conscious of the need to reach Gypsies. But the deal contains problems that may leave many deserving Gypsies out.</p>
        <p>One obstacle is infighting in the Gypsy community about who should represent them. But in addition, no one was present at some crucial meetings to speak for Gypsy interests. Negotiators decided to speed the payment process by working through groups that had already been administering Holocaust claims, which meant the Claims Conference, and for non-Jews, special partner organizations in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Poland and the Czech Republic. These groups will have the job of advertising the new fund, finding victims and setting up the social programs for Gypsies.</p>
        <p>Some of these partner organizations have been tainted by corruption in the past. Moreover, there will be but one Gypsy leader on the board of directors of the fund, and there may be none on the staffs of the five partner organizations, which may be tempted to concentrate on majority ethnic groups. The German finance ministry, which ultimately will oversee payments, must ensure that the organizations in the five countries take seriously the expensive and difficult task of reaching an unpopular minority.</p>
