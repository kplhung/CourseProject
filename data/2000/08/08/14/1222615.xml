        <p>With his two biggest rivals preoccupied by a war of nerves, Mika Hakkinen came from behind for the second race in a row to get through the first corner first at the start of today's Hungarian Grand Prix. And on the narrow, dusty and twisty Hungaroring, where it is next to impossible to pass, that is half the job of winning.</p>
        <p>The other half is keeping the car on the track during the grueling 77 laps of the 2.4-mile circuit. That is exactly what Hakkinen did to win in 1 hour 45 minutes 33.869 seconds for an average speed of 108.096 miles an hour.</p>

        <p>With his two biggest rivals preoccupied by a war of nerves, Mika Hakkinen came from behind for the second race in a row to get through the first corner first at the start of today's Hungarian Grand Prix. And on the narrow, dusty and twisty Hungaroring, where it is next to impossible to pass, that is half the job of winning.</p>
        <p>The other half is keeping the car on the track during the grueling 77 laps of the 2.4-mile circuit. That is exactly what Hakkinen did to win in 1 hour 45 minutes 33.869 seconds for an average speed of 108.096 miles an hour.</p>
        <p>Michael Schumacher, in a Ferrari, finished second, 7.9 seconds behind, with David Coulthard, Hakkinen's McLaren teammate, another half a second behind.</p>
        <p>But Hakkinen, a 31-year-old from Finland, did far more than steal the show from Schumacher and Coulthard. For the first time this season, Hakkinen took the lead in the Formula One drivers standing from Schumacher and set himself on course to join Juan Manuel Fangio as the only drivers to win the title three years in a row.</p>
        <p>Hakkinen, who started the race 2 points behind Schumacher and tied with Coulthard, now leads the championship with 64 points. Schumacher is in second with 62 points, and Coulthard is third with 58. But Hakkinen would not say he was now the favorite to win the series.</p>
        <p>''All the way through the season people talk about who is going to win, or who is going to lose, or who has lost motivation, or who has motivation,'' said Hakkinen, who trailed by 24 points four races ago. ''I've been keeping my own head all the time and concentrating on my work and going to the races and trying to win. I'm not going to think about who is going to win and who is going to lose. That will be decided at the end of the year when we count the points.''</p>
        <p>The first- and third-place finishes by the McLaren cars carried the team past Ferrari in the constructors series, 112-111.</p>
        <p>It was Hakkinen's third victory this year and his second in a row in Hungary, which, because of the vast number of Finnish spectators who fly down for the race, is considered to be the closest thing to a home race for Hakkinen. Hakkinen got off to a perfect start from third place on the grid, taking advantage of the cleaner side of the track -- on the racing line -- while Coulthard started from second, on the dusty side.</p>
        <p>Hakkinen pulled up beside Schumacher, who was on the pole, and squeezed between Schumacher and the edge of the track before the first corner. Schumacher braked late and the two were lined up for a collision, but Schumacher let Hakkinen through.</p>
        <p>''I had again a fantastic start,'' Hakkinen said. ''It was very close with Michael in the first corner, but that's what racing should be. And we came around the corner in one piece.''</p>
        <p>Schumacher said he ''was perhaps a bit too careful'' at the start.</p>
        <p>Tension was high on the starting grid; Schumacher was knocked out of each of the previous two races in tussles at the first corner. In Germany, Coulthard, who started on the pole, swerved in front of him. That move was a repayment by Coulthard for a similar move Schumacher pulled on him at the start of the French Grand Prix in July.</p>
        <p>In Germany, Hakkinen sped past the two of them from fourth place but later lost the lead and finished second. In Austria, Schumacher was also knocked off the track at the first corner, by Ricardo Zonta.</p>
        <p>Today's race was tightest after the second pit stops, when Coulthard, on Lap 51, returned to the track after his stop just behind Schumacher, who had already had his stop. For the last 25 laps, Coulthard, in the faster car, pressured Schumacher while less than a second behind him, trying to force him into an error.</p>
        <p>But Schumacher held his nerve.</p>
        <p>''On this sort of circuit you can take it fairly easy,'' he said. ''You don't have to push to the limit because of the guy behind you. That's all I was doing, just trying to concentrate and not push to the limit or the tires would wear out near the end.''</p>
        <p>The Finnish fans went wild with cheers and horn honking as Hakkinen climbed the victory podium. He waved his arms like an orchestra conductor as the Finnish national anthem played.</p>
