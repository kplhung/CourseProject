        <p>ELMIRA: CANCER STUDY -- State health officials are investigating whether environmental factors were related to cancer in 40 of 4,200 current or former students at Southside High School here. The school was built on an old industrial site, and a nearby pond contains PCB's and benzopyrene, both considered probable carcinogens. Health officials are analyzing the cases to determine whether the rates for the school, which opened in 1979, are higher than in the general population. Because the population is relatively small, slight increases in cases can have a large effect on statistics. Scientists say it would be almost impossible to trace the cancer directly to the site.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: CREDIT RATING ACCESS -- Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, observing that some New Yorkers pay as much as $60,000 more in interest than others with similar credit ratings over the course of a 30-year mortgage, has issued a call that consumers receive access to lender scores as reflected by their credit ratings. Senator Schumer on Saturday announced plans for right-to-know legislation that would allow consumers to review the scores before taking out a home loan. Thousands of New Yorkers with excellent credit pay $140 to $175 more a month than others on their mortgages because they are unaware that they qualify for lower-cost loans, he said.</p>

        <p>CAMERON: NO CHARGES IN SNAKE DEATH -- A 72-year-old man who beat a legally protected snake to death after being bitten will not face charges. The man, Phillip Wheaton, used his cane to beat a timber rattlesnake that bit him on the leg on July 9 in Cameron, a town 70 miles south of Rochester. The state's Department of Environmental Conservation said Friday that Mr. Wheaton had acted in self-defense and would not be fined $1,000. Timber rattlesnakes are protected as an endangered species.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: PROTEST AT N.A.A.C.P. -- The Jewish Defense League yesterday demonstrated in front of the local office of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People at 39 Broadway to protest remarks by an N.A.A.C.P. official who has since resigned. The official, Lee Alcorn, had questioned the selection of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman as the Democratic vice presidential candidate. ''We know that their interest primarily has to do with money,'' Mr. Alcorn had said. Rabbi Yakov Lloyd of the league said, ''To let this go without protesting would be simply obscene.'' The N.A.A.C.P. did not immediately return a call seeking comment.</p>

        <p>HARTFORD: SCHOOL DISCIPLINE -- The percentage of minority students suspended and expelled from school exceeds their representation in many school districts in Connecticut, a new study shows. Minority students receive nearly half of all the suspensions and expulsions statewide but make up less than a third of the student population, the state's disciplinary offense report found. The numbers were reported to the state for the 1998-99 school year. In Norwalk, minority students make up 50 percent of the population but account for 69 percent of punished offenses. In West Haven, 39 percent of students are minorities, but they account for 52 percent of the cases.</p>

        <p>NAUGATUCK: INMATE DIES IN JAIL -- For the second time in less than a month, a prisoner at the Naugatuck police lockup has died. The Naugatuck police said the prisoner was transported from the jail to a Waterbury hospital Saturday before being pronounced dead. They would not release any further details, including the name of the prisoner. The death came as the state's child advocate was investigating the July 22 suicide of a 16-year-old girl in a cell at the same jail. The girl, Falan C. Fox, hanged herself with her socks, the police said.</p>

        <p>NEW JERSEY</p>
        <p>CAMDEN: BATTLESHIP TO BECOME MUSEUM -- The battleship New Jersey, dating from World War II and almost as wide as the Panama Canal, will be moved tomorrow to a Camden pier where it will be converted into a floating museum. The Home Port Alliance, the nonprofit group that will restore the ship, said the vessel will be towed to Pier 1 at about 2 p.m. The group plans to spend more than $20 million to restore the ship and build a pier and a museum and theater complex on the waterfront. The restoration of the ship, taken out of service in 1991, will take at least 14 months, the group said.</p>

        <p>CAYUGA INDIAN LAND CLAIMS -- A hearing to set interest on a $37 million award by the jury in the Cayuga Indian Nation land-claim trial is scheduled in Federal District Court in Syracuse. The tribe is seeking nearly $2 billion in interest for claims dating back to 1795. The state has offered to pay a maximum of $12.1 million.</p>
        <p>NEW JERSEY MOSQUITO SPRAYING -- The Bergen County Mosquito Control Division has scheduled an 11 a.m. news conference in Paramus to announce changes in the county's efforts to control mosquitoes and the spread of the West Nile virus.</p>
