        <p>The BUYandHOLD.com Securities Corporation in New York, an online broker that is part of BUYandHOLD.com Inc., consolidated its account at DiMassimo Brand Advertising in New York, by naming that agency to handle its business-to-business advertising, which had been at Weiss Stagliano Partners. DiMassimo has handled consumer, branding and direct response advertising since both agencies were named to handle the account, with billings estimated at $20 million to $25 million, two-and-a-half months ago.</p>
        <p>Denise Benou Stires, chief marketing officer at BUYandHOLD, said the parting with Weiss Stagliano ''was a joint decision.'' She characterized the business-to-business duties as ''tactical'' and not making the most of Weiss Stagliano's strengths. She added that DiMassimo's experience is ''in accordance with the approachability and accessibility that the brand requires.''</p>
