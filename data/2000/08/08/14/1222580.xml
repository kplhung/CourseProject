        <p>For years, the authorities and some of his neighbors say, Arthur Alalouf lived a reclusive life in Gravesend, Brooklyn, sulking in his parents' home at 16 Parkway Court.</p>
        <p>He kept a shabby room in his parents' basement. He took Xanax, a prescription drug used to calm anxiety. He was known to swear loudly at his several large dogs, sometimes shouting foul words out the window at them as they roamed his muddy yard. And he stockpiled weapons, enough for a platoon.</p>
        <p>Mr. Alalouf, 47, who once worked briefly as a prison guard, also managed to remain so secretive and antisocial that some of his neighbors did not realize he still lived among them, until the gunfire rang out Saturday afternoon and heavily armed police officers began to be evacuated in ambulances while a helicopter was thumping overhead.</p>
        <p>It was one of the most violent police gun battles of the last decade, ending only after four officers had been shot and Mr. Alalouf was dead. And apparently, the police said, it was planned -- the final act of a man who had lived for years as something of a hermit but who chose to draw the police into a shootout for an extremely public end.</p>
        <p>Milton John, the father of one of the injured officers, called it ''suicide by cop.''</p>
        <p>On Friday, the authorities said, the day before Mr. Alalouf opened fire on a police Emergency Service Unit, he broke from his seclusion and made a rare trip out of his house. He went to a gun shop.</p>
        <p>Mr. Alalouf hardly needed any more weapons. A search of his home after the police killed him turned up a literal armory of pistols, rifles and shotguns in his basement and a stack of samurai swords in a first-floor closet. He also had Bowie knives and daggers, the police said, and boxes on boxes of small-arms ammunition.</p>
        <p>But the authorities said that on Friday, Mr. Alalouf arrived at the D and F Sports Center on New Utrecht Avenue and made two new selections: a pump-action shotgun, mounted on a pistol grip, and a Ruger Mini-14, a compact assault rifle. He also bought ammunition: 15 buckshot shells for the shotgun, and 120 rounds for the Mini-14.</p>
        <p>And then he went home, law enforcement officials say, and began to unravel.</p>
        <p>The authorities said Mr. Alalouf had shown signs of bad intentions earlier. He had recently asked his mother to buy him gas cans, duct tape and propane, and said he wanted to burn the house down. She refused to help him.</p>
        <p>But on Saturday morning, they say, he had formed his final plans. He appeared that day dressed in surplus military fatigues and green camouflage gloves, and frightened his parents from their home, telling them he would kill the first police officer he saw.</p>
        <p>As his parents hurried to the 61st Precinct station house, the police said, Mr. Alalouf was ready. He had loaded magazines for his Mini-14 and stuffed his pockets with shotgun shells. And  when the first members of a police Emergency Service Unit approached within range, about 2 p.m., he opened fire through the window with the new shotgun, striking Officer Gregory John in the shoulder and knocking him to the ground.</p>
        <p>William H. Allee Jr., the chief of detectives, said the rest of the unit overwhelmed Mr. Alalouf with a heavy volume of gunfire, forcing him from the window, through the house, and out the back door. Mr. Alalouf then ran across his yard, bashed a hole in a wooden fence, ran through his neighbor's tomato garden, hopped another fence and found refuge in a yard two houses away, at 523 Avenue Y.</p>
        <p>Six hours later, about 8 p.m. Saturday, after the police had stormed his house without finding him, the police and a witness said, they converged on his hiding place. A second exchange ensued, and Mr. Alalouf ran into the second house, where a dozen bullet holes pockmarked the hallway he ran down, and he burst out the back door, where the officers opened fire once more, striking him and the door behind him repeatedly in a long, sustained barrage.</p>
        <p>Ellen Borakove, spokeswoman for the city medical examiner, said five police bullets struck him. One grazed the back of his head. Two struck his left arm and passed through. Another slammed into his right hip and exited through his buttock. A fifth hit him squarely on the right side of his head, killing him. He was pronounced dead where he fell.</p>
        <p>Three other officers were struck in the final exchanges and taken to Kings County Hospital. Jose Guerra, 34, was shot in the face, eye and leg, and remained in an intensive care unit last night. Joseph Ocasio, 43, was shot in the left calf and, along with Officer John, 32, remained hospitalized in stable condition. James McGrath, 33, whose face was grazed by a bullet, was treated and released.</p>
        <p>All the officers were members of Emergency Service Units. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani praised them yesterday, and said he believed they would make a full recovery, although doctors were still evaluating the injury to Officer Guerra's eye.</p>
        <p>''The police officers that subdued him did a wonderful job under tremendous stress,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''When you have one guy who is willing to give up his life and the police have to be concerned not only about their own safety, but the safety of the neighborhood, they are at a tremendous disadvantage. So to have executed this without the loss of innocent human life is remarkable.''</p>
        <p>In one regard, the police were vulnerable to criticism: for having lost track of Mr. Alalouf for hours while they assumed he was in his house. But the authorities swept aside questions about tactics, saying the neighborhood was secure and surrounded, and that the first exchange was decisive, because it chased Mr. Alalouf from his weapons cache, including the loaded assault rifle, which he left on his kitchen table. A Mini-14, the authorities said, fires bullets capable of penetrating body armor.</p>
        <p>''We think because of the officers' tactics, he was unable to get back to that and fled just with the shotgun, which was, I think, fortunate for us,'' Chief Allee said.</p>
        <p>Many of the details of Mr. Alalouf's life remained sketchy yesterday. The city's Department of Correction said that he worked as a prison guard at an adolescent unit on Rikers Island from June 1982 to November 1984, and had been the subject of two complaints alleging that he had used excessive force. But the complaints were ruled minor incidents, a law enforcement official said, and neither he nor the inmates were injured.</p>
        <p>The department said that its personnel records had been placed in a building that was later condemned, and could not immediately be retrieved.</p>
        <p>In the years since he left city service, Mr. Alalouf apparently eluded the attention of the authorities, who said he had no known criminal record.</p>
        <p>He also accumulated weapons, most of which the police said were legal. Chief Allee said the authorities believed that the two guns he bought on Friday had been legally bought in the company of his father, who put them on his credit card.</p>
        <p>The police also said that Mr. Alalouf had not held regular employment in 15 years, and showed little interest in work, except in 1992, when he tried to join the Police Department but was turned down, apparently because he was too old.</p>
        <p>''From what we can tell, he just stayed at home,'' one official said. Chief Allee said he also spent time at a rural hunting camp.</p>
        <p>At home, he managed to keep his neighbors on edge.</p>
        <p>One woman said he fashioned a peephole in his fence through which he sometimes peered out. Others said he ventured into his back yard now and then to stare at a teenager  as she swam in her family's pool.</p>
        <p>Another man, Boris Kaminyar, who lived directly behind him, said he took care to avoid his strange neighbor four years ago, when Mr. Alalouf threw old shoes and feces into his back yard.</p>
        <p>Although they stopped speaking, Mr. Alalouf remained a foreboding presence.</p>
        <p>''All the time he would look in my window with binoculars at night,'' Mr. Kaminyar said. ''He wanted to look for my wife.''</p>
