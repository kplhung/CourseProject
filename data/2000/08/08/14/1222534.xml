        <p>Media analysts and network executives said over the weekend that the sale of TV stations owned by Chris-Craft Industries to the owner of the Fox network, the News Corporation, was likely to create a host of opportunities for the News Corporation -- and raise almost as many questions.</p>
        <p>The questions will affect the News Corporation and Viacom, which until Friday had also been bidding to acquire the stations.</p>
        <p>The sale, expected to be announced formally this week, is valued at $85 a share, or about $3.5 billion. It will add 10 stations owned by Chris-Craft and present the News Corporation's leader, Rupert Murdoch, with a competitive edge -- ownership of two powerful TV stations in a number of major cities, including New York and Los Angeles. It will also give him extended control over dissemination of local news in New York, where he would own both Channel 5 and Channel 9 as well as The New York Post.</p>
        <p>The deal, however, raises questions about how the News Corporation will deal with current Federal Communications Commission restrictions. They include a limit on how much reach one broadcasting company can attain and a ban on cross-ownership of newspapers and TV station in the same city, which Mr. Murdoch won a waiver for when only Channel 5 was involved.</p>
        <p>The deal especially throws into question what may happen to UPN, which is now owned by Viacom but will become the Paramount Network in January.</p>
        <p>No network has ever succeeded without owning stations in the two largest media markets of New York and Los Angeles. Viacom, which also owns CBS, finds itself in the position of running a network whose two biggest stations will be owned by a company that also owns a rival network. And the affiliation agreement between the Chris-Craft stations and the Paramount network expires in January.</p>
        <p>Some network executives are already predicting the Viacom president, Mel Karmazin, will simply decide that the UPN Network, now losing between $100 million and $150 million a year, is an asset not worth keeping. Faced with some CBS cable TV assets that had little prospects of turning a profit in the next five years, the Eye on People channel and Tele-Noticias, Mr. Karmazin chose to shut down both of them.</p>
        <p>But the UPN Network had shown recent signs of growth, having found a hit in a weekly wrestling franchise. One media analyst said that Mr. Karmazin, in recent private conversations, said ''UPN will be profitable in a year.''</p>
        <p>''He was very much of a mind to keep it,'' the analyst added.</p>
        <p>Whether that will still be true with the News Corporation owning the most important stations broadcasting the network is far from certain. But the analyst, who spoke on condition of anonymity, cautioned against any facile predictions that Mr. Karmazin will quickly pull out of UPN.</p>
        <p>''There are too many advantages to owning two networks,'' the analyst said. ''You could put a CBS News nightly newscast at 10 p.m. on the alternate network and amortize so much more of the costs of an expensive news division. You can cross-promote to your second network when your main network may have a show that has a totally different appeal.''</p>
        <p>It is similar opportunities on the local level presented by dual ownership of stations in the same city that are at the center of News Corporation's plans for the Chris-Craft stations. Michael J. Wolf, who heads the media department at Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton, said: ''There are cross-promotions that can take place, similar to the way that companies are able to drive viewers from one cable network to another. The same thing can work in local television markets.''</p>
        <p>Two stations in the same city can also achieve great economies of scale, Mr. Wolf said, by combining news operations and advertising sales staffs. ''This would let News Corp. get a bigger piece of an advertiser's budget,'' Mr. Wolf said. And it could open up possibilities in sports, he added, by allowing the News Corporation to place a team's games on two channels. For example, Channel 5 carries Yankees games. But because that is the flagship station of the Fox network there are many nights when Fox cannot pre-empt entertainment programming for a game. Now it might be possible to move some games over to Channel 9.</p>
        <p>Dual ownership is certain to be most noticed in New York because of Mr. Murdoch's ownership of The Post. Presumably he will have to gain an additional waiver from the F.C.C. to add Channel 9 if he intends to retain The Post because of the continuing restriction on cross-ownership of newspapers and stations.</p>
        <p>But Fox will be much more aggressive in seeking to overturn another F.C.C. restriction, the one that limits a broadcasting company to owning stations that reach no more than 35 percent of the nation's homes. Fox was already at that cap before this acquisition. With the Chris-Craft stations, the network will be far above the cap. Fox has already filed suit in federal court to challenge the regulation and analysts and executives said this weekend that Fox would surely step up its lobbying efforts in Congress to have the limits either raised or eliminated.</p>
        <p>Even if the restrictions stay in  place, Fox is not likely to simply sell off stations to get down to the limit. ''You may see a lot of station swapping take place,'' a Fox executive said. Another network executive compared what might take place to ''a game of go fish, where you take one card and I take another.'' The point of the game: match up stations and cities to create dual ownership.</p>
        <p>But all this presumes that owning  stations will continue to be good business, a point many broadcast executives disagree on. One senior executive with experience at two networks said many family-owned companies with long histories running TV stations had recently decided to quit the business, sensing that the future was too unpredictable. ''It's not like by adding Channel 9, you now have two of seven stations in New York. With all the cable channels out there, it means you have two of 100.''</p>
        <p>Most recently, one News Corporation acquisition, the Family Channel, which Mr. Murdoch bought for $1.9 billion in 1997, has struggled to find an identity and to make money.</p>
        <p>Still, David Londoner, a media analyst with ABN Amro, said there was a prospect that coming digital technology would expand the reach of local stations by multiplying their signals from one channel to as many as four. ''More channels in big cities? You should be able to do something with that,'' he said.</p>
