        <p>Dancing for Laughs  Delicate and dainty they're not. Still, the members of Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo are not without their charms. With stage names like Ida Nevasayneva, Mikolojus Vatissnyem and Igor Slowpokin, and decked out in oversize pointe shoes and tutus, the dancers in the all-male company are ''a cross between City Ballet and 'I Love Lucy,' '' said Tory Dobrin, the troupe's artistic director. Beginning tonight, the 24-year-old company will present its first New York performances of classics like ''Raymonda's Wedding'' and ''Russian Dance'' before leaping across centuries with Merce Cunningham's ''Cross Currents.'' The two-week engagement is at the Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea. Information: (212) 242-0800.</p>
        <p>Exalted One  Virgin mother, queen of heaven, intercessor: such were the roles assigned to the Virgin Mary throughout the Middle Ages and Renaissance, when her importance rivaled that of Jesus. Devotion to her took a variety of forms, but perhaps none were lovelier than illuminated manuscripts. Beginning tomorrow, ''The Queen of the Angels,'' an exhibition at the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, will examine 400 years of these radiant works. A related exhibition, ''The Making of a Medieval Book,'' explains the labor-intensive process behind the images. Both run through Nov. 5. Information: (310) 440-7300.</p>
        <p>Pushing Boundaries  Fringe, fringe, everywhere. While the Festival Fringe opens across the Atlantic as part of the 2000 Edinburgh International Festival, those closer to home are honing their own envelope-pushing performances. Beginning on Wednesday, the New York International Fringe Festival will offer 175 productions by 2,000 artists, including Jimmy O'Neill's ''Life With Jeem,'' about the relationship between a gay man and the top half of a Macy's mannequin, and ''Five at the Fringe,'' a series of plays staged by members of the Drama League Directors Project. Information: (212) 420-8877.</p>
