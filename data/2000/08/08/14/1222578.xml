        <p>It is a long distance from the political conventions that nominated Al Smith and Franklin D. Roosevelt to the weeklong infomercials that are called conventions today. Once conventions were battlefields where real fights were waged over platforms, personalities and power. Vice-presidential choices were not made beforehand; the selection of the presidential nominee was seldom sure until the convention had run its course. Conventions had lives and logic all their own. And they mattered.</p>
        <p>This was true for both parties, but the conventions where I observed it were Democratic.</p>
        <p>In Philadelphia in 1948, Hubert Humphrey, then mayor of Minneapolis, gave a speech that made history. ''The time has arrived,'' he said, ''for the Democratic Party to get out of the shadow of states' rights and walk forthrightly into the bright sunshine of human rights.'' President Harry S. Truman accepted the civil rights platform, causing the Dixiecrats to bolt the convention, splitting the party -- or so it seemed. In fact, Truman united the party by giving it a cause.</p>
        <p>In 1952, in Chicago, delegates drafted Gov. Adlai Stevenson of Illinois at Truman's urging -- the last presidential draft. Four years later, when Stevenson was nominated again, he threw the choice for vice president open to the convention, which eventually nominated Estes Kefauver of Tennessee. I supported Humphrey, by then a senator, and managed his campaign on the convention floor. John F. Kennedy was also a contender.</p>
        <p>Fast-forward to 1968. The Democratic Convention was controlled by President Lyndon Johnson and Mayor Richard Daley of Chicago. The process was corrupted and the people betrayed. Even the effort to pass an antiwar platform was stifled.</p>
        <p>The last real Democratic convention was in 1960. Although Kennedy arrived in Los Angeles in very good shape, his nomination was not a sure thing. The reason was Stevenson, who still commanded considerable support even though he had done little to promote his candidacy.</p>
        <p>On the first day of the convention, I attended a pro-Stevenson luncheon at which Eleanor Roosevelt spoke, and I spoke at a late-night rally.</p>
        <p>The next day the Minnesota delegation's leaders caucused on the question of whom to support. Senator Humphrey was undecided. Gov. Orville Freeman, who would be making Kennedy's nominating speech, argued for supporting him on the first ballot. I announced my support for Stevenson.</p>
        <p>The next evening I placed Stevenson's name in nomination on the floor. Only 79 of the 1,512 delegates voted for him. But the demonstrations after my speech and the seconding speech were far more intense and enthusiastic than those for the other nominees.</p>
        <p>Those who were strong for Adlai cheered, of course. Others uttered purging cries of approval to make their change of loyalty easier. And the rest cheered simply as a testimonial to the career and example of Stevenson.</p>
        <p>That 1960 convention marked the end of the active political career of Adlai Stevenson, the purest politician of our times. He was indifferent to what history might say about him and, in 1956, willing to be a sacrificial candidate for the common effort. He became a national figure not because of the press, or even primaries, but because of conventions.</p>
