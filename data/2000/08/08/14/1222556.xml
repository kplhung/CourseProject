        <p>The offense of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers hit a small lull last week during a dreary preseason game against Miami.

Dolphins cornerback Jerry Wilson, barely 5 feet 10 inches, was guarding, all by himself, the 6-4 Johnson.

        <p>The offense of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers hit a small lull last week during a dreary preseason game against Miami. Suddenly, wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson, always the life of the party or the huddle, saw something that would perk things up. Dolphins cornerback Jerry Wilson, barely 5 feet 10 inches, was guarding, all by himself, the 6-4 Johnson. The best defensive backs in the game, some built like small forwards, have a difficult time matching up with Johnson's combination of power and size.</p>
        <p>Wilson did not know it yet, but he was in big trouble. Inside Johnson's head an alarm went off, and his heart began racing. Johnson trotted back to the huddle and looked at quarterback Shaun King, who speaks softly compared to Johnson, who is a 15-piece orchestra.</p>
        <p>''Oh my goodness, Jerry Wilson is on me,'' Johnson told King. ''Get me the ball. Let's move the chains.''</p>
        <p>The next few plays could not have been more predictable. Johnson beat Wilson rather easily -- several times, in fact. But Wilson should not feel bad. Johnson, over the course of his four-year career with the Jets, bruised the egos of many cornerbacks. That is why the Buccaneers reached deep into their wallets -- and their draft-day goody bag -- to pay Johnson $56 million over the next eight years. The team traded away two first-round picks to get him.</p>
        <p>Johnson was an expensive acquisition, but one Tampa Bay needed, because its passing offense last season -- when the Bucs went to the National Football Conference championship game -- was ranked next to last in the league.</p>
        <p>''Keyshawn gives us some identity on offense,'' said Warren Sapp, a team leader and one of the best defensive linemen in football. ''We should put some points on the board.''</p>
        <p>Johnson did not leave New York quietly. He accused Jets Coach Al Groh of engineering the trade, and absolved Bill Parcells, the team's chief of football operations. Johnson recently tossed one more grenade at Groh when he said in an interview: ''No, I don't like Al Groh. I did like him. I don't now. The way he handled the situation. There was a lack of communication on his part and he displayed poor judgment.''</p>
        <p>Johnson gives Tampa Bay something the team has not had in years, maybe ever -- a wideout who blasts off like a rocket every time he leaves the line of scrimmage and can single-handedly change a game. With the addition of Johnson, and with awesome talent like Sapp and the Pro Bowl fullback Mike Alstott, along with one of the best young coaches in the game in Tony Dungy, the Buccaneers are favored by many to reach the Super Bowl.</p>
        <p>But Tampa Bay did not sign Johnson simply for his talent. The Buccaneers also liked Johnson's attitude. And when it comes to attitude, Johnson's mouth runneth over. His brashness and rambunctious nature make him so very good. Away from the field, they make him so very quotable. He is the player who soars with the mouth that roars.</p>
        <p>The latter was never more apparent when Johnson sat down for an interview over the weekend, and the main topic was his former team, the Jets, a subject that still gets his blood pumping all these months later. Some of Johnson's comments will certainly rile his old pals, as he went on at length about:</p>
        <p>WAYNE CHREBET -- Their relationship became strained after Johnson called Chrebet a ''team mascot'' in his book. A Jets player said the real rub between the two stemmed from Johnson's belief that Chrebet receives extensive attention in the news media because he is white.</p>
        <p>''That's not a secret,'' Johnson said. He later added: ''The better question to ask is: Are there other people who can do what he does? Yeah. I can get a dozen of them right now, from Jackson State, from Morgan State, from Grambling, from Southern, from Howard.'' Johnson used traditionally black colleges as his example.</p>
        <p>''I could really care less if he is black or white,'' Johnson said. ''The only thing that I have a problem with is when people try to compare us when there is no comparison.''</p>
        <p>Johnson also said that another reason for Chrebet's popularity was his status as a local player from Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y.</p>
        <p>A Jets spokesman said today that Chrebet was not available for comment because it was a day off for the players. When asked earlier this month what training camp has been like without Johnson, Chrebet said, ''Quiet.''</p>
        <p>BILL PARCELLS -- Johnson believes that if Parcells were still on the sideline, Johnson, too, would be in New York, because Parcells would have broken the Jets' tradition of not tearing up an existing contract with more than a year remaining on it for a new one. Johnson had two more years left on his deal before he was traded.</p>
        <p>In fact, Johnson said, the Jets almost gave him a new deal at the beginning of his third season. Parcells, according to Johnson, proposed that Johnson give back a certain amount of money and, in exchange, the Jets would chop two years off his contract, allowing Johnson to become a free agent more quickly. The league's management council rejected the proposal. Parcells has declined to talk specifically about Johnson's contract.</p>
        <p>When Bill Belichick replaced Parcells as coach -- albeit for a brief period -- he, too, was willing to break with Jets tradition and work out a new deal, according to Johnson. Belichick proposed giving Johnson what amounted to a one-year contract worth $5 million, the receiver said, as a temporary solution until a longer deal could be reached. But Belichick later resigned from the Jets and headed for New England. Belichick has said in the past that he would have done everything he could to keep Johnson.</p>
        <p>THE SPYING GAME -- Johnson is the first to speak publicly about something Jets players have whispered about for years. Johnson said the team installed an elaborate hidden camera system in the locker room and weight rooms to spy on the players. Johnson said that he once, jokingly, made an obscene gesture toward a camera he had located.</p>
        <p>A team spokesman said the organization had no comment.</p>
        <p>TEAM FOCUS -- Johnson said some players were too concerned about things other than winning. ''Some of those guys I just could not deal with,'' Johnson said, making it clear he was not speaking of the entire team. ''There were too many guys worried if they had a commercial.''</p>
        <p>QUARTERBACK RAY LUCAS -- By drafting the rookie Chad Pennington, the Jets basically signaled the end of the Lucas era. ''If I was Ray, I would curse out the organization and then play somewhere else,'' Johnson said, ''because there is no loyalty there.''</p>
        <p>Johnson maintained that the Jets purposely steered away potential national news media interviews, as well as lucrative endorsement deals, as a way to keep his ego in check. Johnson said that when GQ magazine once called to schedule an interview, the team said Johnson was not interested, without first asking him. A team spokesman said the Jets had no comment.</p>
        <p>Jets executives may not be saying much publicly about Johnson, but clearly they are tired of hearing him reliving the old days. A team official said he wished Johnson would ''simply be quiet about us.'' Johnson said a Jets official he declined to identify relayed a message on behalf of the team to pipe down.</p>
        <p>In fairness to Johnson, he is being asked by news media representatives to talk about the Jets, not vice versa. ''Maybe the Jets should stop worrying about me,'' Johnson said. ''They have enough to worry about.''</p>
        <p>Sometimes Johnson's harsh words, which can be both painful and truthful, overshadow his substance. In many ways, he is an ideal National Football League player. Johnson is a Pro Bowler, with 31 career touchdowns and more than 4,000 career yards. He owns a restaurant in Beverly Hills, Calif., his name does not show up on the police blotter, and his work ethic is renowned.</p>
        <p>''I do everything I'm supposed to,'' he said. ''I do not get into trouble. I work my butt off. That's all I do.''</p>
        <p>Because of the high-profile nature of the trade, Johnson may have a bigger national following than ever. When President Clinton visited the Buccaneers training camp recently, one of his first questions to team officials was, ''Where's Keyshawn?''</p>
        <p>He is easy to find. He's the one catching all the passes -- and talking about it.</p>
