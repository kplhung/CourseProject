        <p>I was told I had cancer on a beautiful blue day in July. I was out on Cape Cod, finishing the first draft of a novel when the telephone rang. I had thought it was about time for me to have a bit of good luck, and when I heard my surgeon's voice I assumed I was safe. In novels people were called into offices for bad news, and anyway, it was far too gorgeous a day for tragedy. Roses were in full bloom. Bees rumbled by the windowpanes, lazy with pollen and heat.</p>
        <p>I was certain my doctor was phoning to tell me the biopsy had come back negative, I was absolutely sure of it, but then she said, ''Alice, I'm sorry.'' I could hear the concern and sadness in her voice, and I understood that some things are true no matter how and when you're told. In a single moment, the world as I knew it dropped away from me, leaving me on a far and distant planet, one where there was no gravity and no oxygen and nothing made sense anymore.</p>
        <p>It had been a bad few years for my family. My beloved sister-in-law Jo Ann had lost a courageous battle with brain cancer; my mother had suffered a severe stroke then had been diagnosed with breast cancer. I had spent two years completely involved in the health care of several people I loved, finishing up my novel ''Here on Earth'' during hours stolen so early in the morning that the birds were still asleep. By the time ''Here on Earth'' was chosen as an Oprah Book Club book, I myself was not feeling well. Two days after I returned from Chicago, I reached down and felt a lump in my breast.</p>
        <p>All through my sister-in-law Jo Ann's illness I had been writing short stories. I needed a fictional place to which I could escape and had neither the time nor the psychic energy for a larger project. But these were a novelist's stories, and they quickly became interwoven, the tale of a family deep in the trenches of the same sort of struggle my family now faced.</p>
        <p>I was at the hospital every day for months, and the world outside, those people with plans -- the lovers, the new parents, the students -- seemed far less real than the fictional world I was creating. When Jo Ann asked me to find her a grave site, a heartbreaking mission if ever there was one, my characters from ''Local Girls'' made a similar trek on the very same day, although they were far wiser than I, and far more optimistic. Frankly, I don't know if I could have made it through that particular afternoon without the assistance of the women from ''Local Girls.''</p>
        <p>In my experience, ill people become more themselves, as if once the excess was stripped away only the truest core of themselves remained. In my sister-in-law Jo Ann's case, she became sweeter with each day, a kinder and more compassionate person despite her agony. My mother, always one to embrace life, was set to see ''Eyes Wide Shut'' with her 18-year-old grandson on the day she died. My other sister-in-law, Maryellen, diagnosed with breast cancer a few weeks after I was, used her own medical background to become an amazing researcher, as knowledgeable as any expert.</p>
        <p>And who was I at the very bottom of my soul, beneath skin and blood and bones? I was not as kindhearted and gracious as Jo Ann, not as fearless as my mother, not as capable and independent as Maryellen. I knew who I was when I put my surgery off, a foolish thing to do, and yet I felt compelled to finish the first draft of my new novel. In a time when everything around me seemed completely out of control, when lives were being cut short and fate seemed especially cruel, I had the need to get to an ending of something. I was desperate to know how things turned out, in fiction if not in life. More than ever, more than anything, I was a writer.</p>
        <p>I removed myself from everyone but my closest friends and family. I told almost no one about my illness, and instead turned to what I had always found most healing. Writers don't choose their craft; they need to write in order to face the world, and this was still true for me. Even now, writing was a transcendent experience. When I became too ill to sit up for long, I moved a futon into my office and went from desk to bed, back and forth until the line between dreaming and writing was nothing more than a thin, translucent thread.</p>
        <p>What was real and what was imagined became braided together. I lived in my own world and the world of my book simultaneously. I could lie on a table during a bone scan and yet slip into the river where waterlilies floated downstream, feet sinking into the soft mud. I could be walking through snowstorms, moonlight, fields of roses while receiving radiation.</p>
        <p>An insightful, experienced oncologist told me that cancer need not be a person's whole book, only a chapter. Still, novelists know that some chapters inform all others. These are the chapters of your life that wallop you and teach you and bring you to tears, that invite you to step to the other side of the curtain, the one that divides those of us who must face our destiny sooner rather than later. What I was looking for during 10 months of chemotherapy and radiation was a way to make sense of sorrow and loss.</p>
        <p>I wrote to find beauty and purpose, to know that love is possible and lasting and real, to see day lilies and swimming pools, loyalty and devotion, even though my eyes were closed and all that surrounded me was a darkened room. I wrote because that was who I was at the core, and if I was too damaged to walk around the block, I was lucky all the same. Once I got to my desk, once I started writing, I still believed anything was possible.</p>
