        <p>Gov. George W. Bush of Texas this weekend defended the generous retirement package that his running mate, Dick Cheney, received from his former employer as a standard practice for a company executive.</p>
        <p>But senior Democrats today derided Mr. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, for standing behind the settlement when the Republican-led Congress has resisted increasing the minimum wage.</p>
        <p>After accepting Mr. Bush's offer to join him as the vice-presidential candidate, Mr. Cheney resigned as chairman and chief executive of the Halliburton Company, a Dallas-based energy services company. Halliburton awarded him a financial settlement worth an estimated $20 million after five years of service during which he received about $12.5 million in pay and stock options currently worth $39 million.</p>
        <p>In an interview with The Los Angeles Times that was published today, Mr. Bush said he was aware that Mr. Cheney would receive a retirement package, as any successful chief executive would. Mr. Bush said: ''I think what you ought to do is ask, 'Does the board of directors know what they are doing? Are they expert? And let the experts make the decision as to what's fair.' ''</p>
        <p>Chris Lehane, a spokesman for Vice President Al Gore, said the size of the retirement package and Mr. Bush's approval reflects the close relationship between the Republican Party and big business that working families might find troublesome.</p>
        <p>Dirk Vande Beek, communications director for Mr. Cheney, said critics were making too much of the matter, ''especially when no one complained about the $200 million compensation package Bob Rubin got after leaving Goldman-Sachs.''</p>
        <p>Juleanna Glover, press secretary for Mr. Cheney, said Halliburton planned to disclose details of the retirement package on Wednesday. Details of the package Robert E. Rubin received after leaving the firm he headed to become chairman of President Clinton's National Economic Council in 1992 could not be independently confirmed.</p>
