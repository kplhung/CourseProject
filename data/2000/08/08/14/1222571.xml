        <p>The Democratic National Convention will adopt a platform on Tuesday that, like its Republican counterpart, makes a broad effort to reach voters in the middle, calling for schools to be more accountable for student performance, stricter control of the nation's borders, expanded global trade, a stronger military and the death penalty.</p>
        <p>But in the details, the platforms sharply diverge on most issues, providing clear indications of how Gore and Bush administrations would differ.</p>
        <p>*The Democrats offer modest, focused tax cuts to help middle-class families, while the Republicans call for an across-the-board income tax cut to stimulate the economy.</p>
        <p>*The Democrats call for increased financing for public schools, while the Republicans support taxpayer-financed vouchers to help parents pay for private schools.</p>
        <p>*The Democrats would keep the Social Security system as it is, bolstering it with general tax revenues. The Republicans call for allowing taxpayers to invest part of their payroll taxes in the financial markets.</p>
        <p>*The Democrats propose extending Medicaid, the health care program for those with low incomes, to more children, while the Republicans advocate tax breaks to help people buy private health insurance.</p>
        <p>*The Democrats call for developing the technology for a limited system to protect the nation from ballistic missile attacks, while the Republicans support moving full speed ahead with an ambitious, space-based system.</p>
        <p>*The Democrats endorse civil rights protections for gays and support laws intended to expand the rights of unions to organize workers. The Republicans oppose gay rights and support laws intended to reduce the ability of unions to organize.</p>
        <p>For all those clear disagreements, the platforms are alike in that they closely reflect the styles, broad visions and campaign agendas of the two candidates. Writing a platform usually tests a candidate's ability to manage the factions in his party, and both Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore successfully enforced a high degree of unity on their platform committees.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Gore, the result has been a Democratic platform that wraps him more tightly than ever in Mr. Clinton's legacy.</p>
        <p>Far from stamping a distinctive Gore imprint on the Democratic Party, the document warmly embraces the centrist policies of the Clinton administration and lavishly credits them for the prosperity of the last seven years.</p>
        <p>''In 1992, Bill Clinton and Al Gore were elected to turn the American economy around,'' the platform declares in its opening lines. ''Today, the success of these new ideas is clear.''</p>
        <p>From those lines through most of its 20,000 words, the platform articulates a ''new Democrat'' agenda that cuts a middle path between welfare-state liberalism and laissez-faire Republicanism, advocating active but smaller government, fiscal discipline, free trade and tough crime policies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton first imposed those positions on the party in 1992 over the objections of liberals, and Mr. Gore's aides fought back efforts -- albeit weak ones -- by progressives again this year to pull the 2000 platform leftward on health care, defense spending and trade.</p>
        <p>''Both the rhetoric and the positions are where the party set off in '92,'' said Thomas Mann, a senior fellow with the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan policy organization. ''Everything is designed to say, 'We are continuing with the policies and the progress of the Clinton years, even though we are separating ourselves from the man.' ''</p>
        <p>If the Democratic platform represents continuity, the platform adopted by the Republicans in Philadelphia makes more of a break, in tone if not always in substance, with their platforms of the recent past.</p>
        <p>Much like Mr. Clinton in 1992, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has tried to use the 2000 platform to capture a broader swath of moderate swing voters. While the Republican platform remains fundamentally conservative -- strongly opposing abortion, gay rights and gun control while calling for tax cuts, smaller government and more military spending -- some of the hard-edged proposals from 1996 are gone. The platform no longer would deny citizenship to the American-born children of illegal immigrants, abolish the federal department of education and end federal financing for the arts.</p>
        <p>Instead it calls for more inclusive attitudes toward immigrants, a strong federal role in making schools more effective and the preservation of the biggest of big-government programs, Social Security.</p>
        <p>But for both candidates, tamping down open dissent from their parties' most militant wings meant accepting language that sometimes went beyond their original positions, or flatly contradicted their views.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Gore, the major fight was on trade. Over the objections of labor unions, the platform endorses the policy of ''fast track,'' which would allow presidents to negotiate certain treaties without Congressional approval. But at the behest of unions, the platform also calls for negotiating labor and environmental standards into all trade accords.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Bush, adopting softer positions on issues like education and immigration meant accepting language flatly opposing abortion, even though he would personally allow it in cases of rape or incest or when a woman's life is in danger.</p>
        <p>In tone, both platforms also reflect the stump styles of the two candidates. The Republican platform is heavily salted with the kind of optimistic, inclusive-sounding phrases that flavor Mr. Bush's speeches.</p>
        <p>''We approach these challenges with compassionate conservatism, a concept that is as old as the pioneers heading west in wagon trains, in which everyone had responsibility to follow the rules, but no one would be left behind,'' the platform says.</p>
        <p>The Democratic document mirrors Mr. Gore's knife-edged efforts to cast Mr. Bush as a risk to the nation's peace and prosperity. Thus, the platform asserts, the Republicans ''eschew fiscal discipline and offer up nothing less than fiscal disaster.'' Mr. Bush's Social Security plan would ''take the 'security' out of Social Security.'' And the Republican proposal for a space-based missile defense system ''would plunge us into a new arms race.''</p>
        <p>Yet even as it attacks the Republicans, the Democratic platform manages to echo its rivals' words. ''If America is to secure prosperity, peace and security for all, we cannot afford to go back,'' it says. ''We must move forward together and we must not leave anyone behind.''</p>
