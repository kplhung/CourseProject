        <p>''Oh what a beautiful mornin','' sang Mark Oliver Everett, the man better known as E, on Friday night at Bowery Ballroom. Coaxing some blues from his piano under dim nightclub lights, wearing striped pajamas, E hardly resembled Gordon McRae about to stride off into a cornfield. Yet the signature song from ''Oklahoma!'' set the right tone for this performance by E's band, Eels, which unfolded like a musical set at an alternative rock show.</p>
        <p>It even had an overture, starring Lisa Germano, who has put her fine solo work on hold to join Eels on tour. Ms. Germano led the band into a slice of lounge exotica that became a minuet. Within five minutes she played guitar, violin, keyboard and recorder, and sang. By the time E claimed his piano, Eels had hopped more genres than many bands visit in their careers.</p>

        <p>''Oh what a beautiful mornin','' sang Mark Oliver Everett, the man better known as E, on Friday night at Bowery Ballroom. Coaxing some blues from his piano under dim nightclub lights, wearing striped pajamas, E hardly resembled Gordon McRae about to stride off into a cornfield. Yet the signature song from ''Oklahoma!'' set the right tone for this performance by E's band, Eels, which unfolded like a musical set at an alternative rock show.</p>
        <p>It even had an overture, starring Lisa Germano, who has put her fine solo work on hold to join Eels on tour. Ms. Germano led the band into a slice of lounge exotica that became a minuet. Within five minutes she played guitar, violin, keyboard and recorder, and sang. By the time E claimed his piano, Eels had hopped more genres than many bands visit in their careers.</p>
        <p>Pastiche is hardly new in pop, and E's use of it has earned him comparisons to Beck, another Los Angeles pop culture addict. But Beck is a true avant-gardist whose deepest insights are formal, while E, an old-fashioned modernist, tips the scales toward content. Many of his songs are about personal subjects, including the suicide of his sister and the recent loss of his mother to cancer. These songs are unsettled because the emotions they express -- bereavement, alienation, fragile hope -- are themselves queasy. E uses the pop lexicon as a tourist uses a phrase book, trying different idioms to communicate clearly.</p>
        <p>On recordings E has has often used samples to give shape to the Babel in his head. Live, he relied on Ms. Germano, the costume-wearing horn players David Lhebo and Steve Crumb, and the percussionist Butch (born Jonathan Morton) to juggle instruments and styles. The group, which also included Orest Balaban on bass, had the most fun with the biggest challenges, including a free-jazz improvisation in the middle of the chipper ''Fly Swatter.''</p>
        <p>Other songs were influenced by other Californians: Brian Wilson, Randy Newman and Henry Mancini. Like those musical cineastes, E explores humor's jarring effect along with the difficulties of tenderness. He was a jovial host, peppering the evening with jokes that culminated in his turning the microphone over to Butch, who drummed with one hand while doing a Beat-style reading of lyrics by the heavy-metal jesters of Motley Crue, who were performing on Long Island that night.</p>
        <p>In musicals, humor is the leavening that stops sentimentality from falling flat. E uses a lot of it, hoping that the long way around to emotion will prove rewarding. Occasionally he puts aside his props, as he did on Friday in a simple, piano-based rendition of the classic ''Dark End of the Street.'' Then, as in a close-up, the wistful heart of E's big productions was revealed.</p>
