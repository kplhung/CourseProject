        <p>A quick end to the strike by more than 86,000 employees of Verizon Communications, the nation's largest telecommunications employer, appeared out of the grasp of negotiators yesterday after unions rejected parts of the company's latest proposal.</p>
        <p>Verizon made a new contract offer at 1 a.m. yesterday that did not overcome the unions' objections.</p>
        <p>''It is old wine in new bottles,'' said Robert Master, a spokesman for the Communications Workers of America, which represents the majority of the striking workers.</p>
        <p>The communications workers' union and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which represent Verizon employees in 12 Eastern states and Washington, D.C., are still at odds with the company on issues like mandatory overtime, stress levels and the movement of work resulting from Bell Atlantic's $72 billion acquisition of GTE, which formed Verizon.</p>
        <p>Still, progress was made in establishing a framework for a contract for several dozen employees of Verizon's wireless unit. And both sides agree that perhaps the main stumbling block was overcome last week in an understanding that would allow unions to organize more easily at Verizon Wireless.</p>
        <p>If anything, the strike illustrates an effort by organized labor to find its footing in the high-technology industries that are reshaping the economy. Instead of wages and benefits, the main objectives of the strike involve an effort to gain a union foothold in new areas and secure concessions for a work force weary of long hours and the concern that mergers might translate into fewer jobs.</p>
        <p>Optimism over Verizon's concession in the wireless area gave way over the weekend to feelings among negotiators that a fast resolution to the strike, which is entering its ninth day, has become more remote.</p>
        <p>The main difference remaining between the two sides concerns the movement of work resulting from the Bell Atlantic-GTE merger.</p>
        <p>The unions are seeking to limit the movement of jobs or tasks by agreeing on a flat percentage of Verizon's work force of 260,000 employees that would be subject to such movement, similar to the half a percentage point agreed upon with Bell Atlantic after it bought Nynex in 1997.</p>
        <p>Verizon, though, wants a more flexible agreement that would limit movement of work by measuring it in net additions or subtractions within a given region.</p>
        <p>In one part of Verizon's offer, the company proposed limiting the number of employees who could transfer from stressful jobs at call centers to other parts of the company. The unions said this proposal would actually make matters worse, but the company said it was only part of the way it would address the issue.</p>
        <p>In addition, the union reiterated concern over Verizon's move to expand in the high-speed Internet access business by acquiring NorthPoint Communications. Verizon told the unions that about 300 union-represented jobs would be shifted into the NorthPoint operation, but details involving the outsourcing of related tasks remained blurry, a person close to the talks said.</p>
        <p>Although an overall agreement is within reach, both sides acknowledged that little progress was made over the weekend. If the walkout drags on, the communications workers' union said it would start using its $400 million strike fund on the 15th day of the strike. The fund would pay its members $200 a week, which would rise to $300 a week if the strike were to last a month.</p>
        <p>Verizon said it had 90,000 repair requests yesterday, up from about 80,000 during most days last week, although the company attributed the increase to rainstorms that knocked out service in parts of several Eastern states. Meanwhile, the number of pickets thinned to about 750 yesterday, down from the thousands at Verizon sites each day last week.</p>
