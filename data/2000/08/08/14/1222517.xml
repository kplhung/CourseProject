        <p>Steven P. Jobs, the co-founder and chief executive of Apple Computer, is not a happy man at the moment.</p>
        <p>Last week, Mr. Jobs called the chief executive of Random House, Peter Olson, to complain about a book the Broadway Books division is scheduled to publish in October, according to Stuart Applebaum, a spokesman for Random House, a unit of Bertelsmann.</p>
        <p>The book, ''The Second Coming of Steve Jobs,'' by Alan Deutschman, portrays Mr. Jobs as an abusive, insecure narcissist who, through a ''reign of terror,'' turned around the once-moribund company and reclaimed his authority.</p>
        <p>Mr. Deutschman, a reporter who has worked for Fortune and GQ and is now a contributing editor at Vanity Fair, says that Mr. Jobs took delight in humiliating Apple employees.</p>
        <p>The book also chronicles some of Mr. Jobs's business failures.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jobs, in his call to Mr. Olson, ''was concerned that we were publishing a quote-unquote hatchet job on him,'' Mr. Applebaum said. He added that Mr. Olson had no comment for Mr. Jobs on the observation.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Jobs can take some comfort because one place he will not be reading about his temper and business problems is in the October issue of Vanity Fair.</p>
        <p>The magazine, which had negotiated a contract with Random House to publish an excerpt from the book, told Mr. Deutschman last Monday that the excerpt would not appear because there was not enough space in the October issue.</p>
        <p>Mr. Deutschman said that he was surprised that Vanity Fair, which is published by the Conde Nast unit of Advance Publications, had canceled his excerpt so late in the production cycle; the magazine will be sent to the printers this week, and Mr. Deutschman had already scheduled his final phone call with the article's fact-checker.</p>
        <p>Mr. Deutschman said he believed that Mr. Jobs had put pressure on the magazine, but he had no proof of that.</p>
        <p>Matt Tyrnauer, the editor at large who edited Mr. Deutschman's excerpt, said there was no conspiracy.</p>
        <p>''It is unfortunate, but for space reasons three pieces had to be dropped from this issue,'' Mr. Tyrnauer said.</p>
        <p>''Because this is a book excerpt and has to come out before the book's publication date,'' he said, ''it could not hold for a later issue.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jobs, through spokesmen, declined to comment on the book or the excerpt.</p>
