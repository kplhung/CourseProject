        <p>Listening to NetRadio.com's Woodstock 69 music channel or KBAC-FM, Santa Fe's jazz and eclectic radio station, or some other music program over the Internet is gaining popularity among people who spend lots of time online. But delivering simultaneous streams of music to thousands or even millions of listeners over an ever more clogged Internet has become increasingly frustrating. If the audio stream hits too many traffic jams, the listener may find his Internet radio program stuttering or stopping midway through a song.</p>
        <p>One promising remedy involves sending the stream up to a satellite, hopping over most of the jam ups on the ground and landing the music stream at a network hub closer to the listener.</p>

        <p>Listening to NetRadio.com's Woodstock 69 music channel or KBAC-FM, Santa Fe's jazz and eclectic radio station, or some other music program over the Internet is gaining popularity among people who spend lots of time online. But delivering simultaneous streams of music to thousands or even millions of listeners over an ever more clogged Internet has become increasingly frustrating. If the audio stream hits too many traffic jams, the listener may find his Internet radio program stuttering or stopping midway through a song.</p>
        <p>One promising remedy involves sending the stream up to a satellite, hopping over most of the jam ups on the ground and landing the music stream at a network hub closer to the listener.</p>
        <p>That is how Viacom's MTV Networks is helping move the feed from SonicNet.com -- one of 18 MTV Web sites -- to the ears of its Internet audience. SonicNet beams its audio stream to the Loral Skynet Telstar 7 satellite from a station in Tulsa, Okla.</p>
        <p>The satellite feeds SonicNet's programming to antennas around the country, converting it back to an Internet signal that is distributed to 135  network hubs operated by America Online, Excite@Home and other Internet service providers.  Those providers then pass it along through conventional cables or telephone lines to people at their PC's.</p>
        <p>''We don't care if it's delivered by satellite, fiber or carrier pigeon; we care about cost,'' said Nicholas Butterworth, president and chief executive of the MTVi Group, MTV's Internet unit. He made clear, though, that he was still monitoring the results. ''So far the satellite service has proven valuable,'' Mr. Butterworth said, ''but over the long term, who knows?''</p>
        <p>MTVi is using competing ground-based distribution services from companies like Akamai Technologies and Digital Island to improve the reception of its Internet music and video programs.</p>
        <p>The iBeam Broadcasting Corporation, which provides the satellite service to MTVi, said it had signed up 250 Internet content providers the last nine months, since it started operating its network of satellites and fiber to bypass traffic jams on the terrestrial Internet.</p>
        <p>Entertainment and news providers like MSNBC Cable News, another iBeam customer, want to see their Web content delivered to users in the fastest, most efficient way possible and are willing to pay for such service. IBeam charges the companies monthly fees of $4,600 or more.</p>
        <p>IBeam, which had a public stock offering in May, reported a loss of $33.1 million for the second quarter on revenue of $3.4 million. The company has several competitors that offer -- or plan to offer -- satellite service as a way for Internet content companies to rise above the network fray.</p>
        <p>For several years, some overseas Internet service providers have used satellite links as a way to connect to the United States' Internet backbone. But the use of satellite distribution by American Web content companies as a way to gain speed and efficiency is still a new business, though it is an approach similar to the way cable and broadcast TV networks have distributed programming to cable operators and local stations for more than two decades.</p>
        <p>IBeam and its rivals, including Cidera, InterPacket and NetSat Express, contend that the Internet is a hostile network environment for streaming media, the Internet term for video and audio that is viewed or heard as it is transmitted, rather than being received and stored on the user's PC before being played.</p>
        <p>''The Internet was not designed to do what we're asking it to do -- to distribute something that looks like TV or sounds like a CD,'' said Peter B. Desnoes, iBeam's chief executive. He notes that a three-minute video stream requires a total data transfer of nearly 10 million bytes -- roughly 800 times more than a typical Web page.</p>
        <p>''The way to solve it is to go around the Internet itself,'' Mr. Desnoes said. ''We have built a very complex private network that includes satellite elements that sends content out to the edge.''</p>
        <p>The public Internet architecture is simply not designed to handle large audiences of simultaneous users who, for example, might tune into Internet Webcasts. Nor are the built-in backup systems. If a few packets of data are lost in the transmission of an e-mail message or a Web page, the Internet's software automatically finds them and replaces them. But in the case of a video transmission, resending packets to replace lost data can make for a choppy picture.</p>
        <p>For video traveling from a single point to many, ''nothing beats satellite,'' said Robert Fagin, Internet, infrastructure and services analyst at Bear, Stearns.</p>
        <p>Bear, Stearns forecasts a $48 billion market for streaming media by 2010, up from $1.3 billion today, with perhaps 30 percent of the flow being delivered by third-party service providers -- whether satellite players or companies that offer land-based route-around solutions.</p>
        <p>Cidera, a satellite-delivery company based in Laurel, Md., predicts that audience demand for streaming media will be so strong that content providers and Internet service companies alike will be willing to pay companies like Cidera to ensure a smooth and steady flow of streaming media.</p>
        <p>Ramachandran Viswanathan, Cidera's vice president for marketing, said Internet service providers recognized that ''streaming media is like a tsunami wave about to break on them.''</p>
        <p>Even when people have high-speed Internet connections like the DSL service available through telephone companies, they can find that streaming media can be slowed or disrupted by bottlenecks on the Internet, said Bill Collatos, a venture capitalist.</p>
        <p>Mr. Collatos is a founding managing general partner of Spectrum Equity, a $3 billion firm in Boston that has invested in Orblynx Inc. of Fairfax, Va., a company that, with the help of Intelsat, has developed technology for distributing Internet content by satellite.</p>
        <p>For the public, investment opportunities are still limited. IBeam shares were offered at $10 in May, and reached nearly $28 in early June, before falling back. They closed at $10.1875 on Friday.</p>
        <p>Cidera, InterPacket and NetSat Express have all registered for public offerings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but have not set dates for proceeding. Meanwhile, competition is on the way from several big, established satellite companies, including Intelsat and PanAmSat, which are putting their own Internet-content delivery networks into service.</p>
        <p>IBeam appears to be ahead of the others in its service concept, which goes beyond delivery and includes flourishes like adding other material to the information stream. For MTVi, for example, iBeam can insert advertising into the live streams, tailored to individual subscribers.</p>
        <p>''If you are a cat owner, you will get a cat commercial,'' Mr. Desnoes said. ''We provide those services.''</p>
        <p>The economics of the business models are still to be proved by iBeam and the other start-ups, which lease satellite capacity rather than operate their own spacecraft.</p>
        <p>Roger Stanyard, the principal consultant at the British firm DTT Consulting, has studied use of satellites with the Internet for more than three years. He said the most that a company like Cidera could expect to charge an Internet service provider was $250 a month -- a figure that he said in some cases might not cover the cost of providing the service. ''It becomes difficult to get your money back,'' Mr. Stanyard said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Collatos, the venture capitalist, remains guardedly optimistic about the Internet satellite companies. ''All are early stage and they will miss their plans; it's inevitable,'' he acknowledged. ''But fundamentally, the concept they have is sound.''</p>
