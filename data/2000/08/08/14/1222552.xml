        <p>Upstate New Yorkers think of Rockland County as downstate, while downstate New Yorkers think of it as upstate, if they think about it at all. Many know it simply as the first rest stop after crossing the Tappan Zee Bridge: Rockland, New Jersey.</p>
        <p>At just 176 square miles, Rockland is the smallest county in the state (after the five boroughs of New York City) and one that is often slighted because of its precarious foothold west of the Hudson River above New Jersey. Even some of its own residents say that Rockland is just the county that you have to go through to get somewhere else.</p>
        <p>Yet geography is only partly to blame for this identity crisis. Although Rockland has pockets of wealth, it has never wielded the political muscle of Nassau, or enjoyed the same cachet as Westchester, its better-known neighbor across the Hudson. It has never produced a governor, and its most honored native, James A. Farley, the postmaster general under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, moved to Manhattan and was buried in Westchester. ''It's another thing to be chagrined about,'' said Thomas F. X. Casey, the Rockland County historian.</p>
        <p>Now, an increasing number of Rockland's citizens are seeking recognition and respect through a surge of civic activism: protests, town meetings, even bold threats to withhold tax money from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority if more local trains and buses are not provided. But at the same time, many other citizens are fighting to preserve the serene landscape and quiet charm that have long defined their county. Like so many places in the Hudson River Valley, Rockland seems caught between two contradictory impulses as it tries to decide whether it is ready for a larger role in the world and the headaches that come along with growth and visibility.</p>
        <p>''There are people who preferred when Rockland was forgotten,'' said Craig H. Long, a police detective and historian for the town of Ramapo. ''They were content, and didn't seek that recognition, because it was like a well-kept secret here. When you open up the county, you invite more problems. Some residents feel the worst thing that ever happened was the Tappan Zee.''</p>
        <p>Rockland -- the name is thought to have been inspired by the rocky soil -- was carved out of Orange County more than two centuries ago by British colonists and thrived for a time as an outpost for shipbuilders and manufacturers. But most of the county remained farmland until the Tappan Zee Bridge was built in 1955. ''The opening of the Tappan Zee changed everything,'' said Mr. Casey, the county historian. ''It changed Rockland from a semirural, sleepy county to a much larger county.''</p>
        <p>Nearly two-thirds of the county is now covered with industries, subdivisions and roads, while much of the rest has been preserved as parks or open space. In the past fiscal year, those industries created 3,100 new jobs, mainly in services and sales. This gave Rockland the second-highest job growth rate in the state, after Putnam County. Most of Rockland's citizens earn a comfortable living; the median income for a family of four is $82,400 a year, compared with $56,200 in New York City.</p>
        <p>Yet desspite its growing affluence and visibility, Rockland continues to be dwarfed by its neighbors. The county has 284,022 residents, compared with 7.4 million in New York City, 1.3 million each in Nassau and Suffolk, and 905,572 in Westchester.</p>
        <p>Frustrated Rockland residents say their concerns and issues are routinely ignored by numbers-driven media organizations and government agencies. ''Let me put it to you this way,'' said Paul Adler, a real estate agent who is chairman of the county's Democratic Party. ''One of the biggest thrills in Rockland is when the Channel 2 weatherman mentions we're going to have rain. Unlike Westchester or Long Island, the only time we make the news is when there's a murder or a flood.''</p>
        <p>They are still seething, for instance, over being assigned an 845 area code in June while Westchester was allowed to keep the longstanding 914 prefix. Though Rockland officials protested loudly, the Public Service Commission in Albany decided that more people would have been inconvenienced by changing the area code in Westchester. ''Obviously, the common goal was to minimize any disruptions,'' said David Flanagan, a spokesman for the commission. ''Westchester had a greater number of businesses and cellular phone users that would have been disrupted.''</p>
        <p>Rockland loyalists saw this as yet another affront. ''I'm pretty upset,'' said Ron Javer, a media account executive from Ramapo, who likened it to being stuck away in a corner all over again. ''Where is 845?'' he asked. ''Montana?''</p>
        <p>Such complaints are nothing new, of course, in a sprawling state where 62 counties compete for the same resources. And for all its grumbling, Rockland actually fares better than many other counties because it is viewed as a swing district in state elections. Albany's political leaders actively court its voters -- 70,912 enrolled Democrats and 40,900 enrolled Republicans -- because they are known to stray across party lines.</p>
        <p>State Senator Thomas P. Morahan, a Rockland Republican who is running for re-election this fall, said Gov. George E. Pataki and other Republican leaders had been very helpful in supporting county projects. He pointed to $840,000 in state funds this year to refurbish downtown areas in the villages of Suffern, Spring Valley and Haverstraw. ''While we don't get as much as Westchester, we're not totally abandoned here,'' he said. ''We are not the poor cousin.''</p>
        <p>State and county officials say it is nearly impossible to pinpoint Rockland's total portion of the state budget because it receives money under various programs and grants. But federal money is tracked more easily, and many county leaders contend that they have been shortchanged in that. Ryan S. Karben, a Democratic county legislator from Ramapo, said his research found that Rockland received only 1 percent of the federal dollars spent annually in New York even though it had 1.5 percent of the state's population.</p>
        <p>''There is a need for a much more aggressive style of leadership,'' he said. ''I think a new generation of leaders are going to demand that Rockland get better. I'm not content with crumbs.''</p>
        <p>One long-running skirmish has been over what county leaders see as a chronic shortage of bus and train service. After years of complaints, Rockland legislators passed a resolution in May that sought state approval to drop out of the M.T.A., which coordinates public transportation for New York City and seven downstate counties. C. Scott Vanderhoef, the county executive, said that Rockland contributed $33.6 million in taxes to the authority in 1998 but received only $11.7 million worth of  service and capital improvements.</p>
        <p>''They pay attention to enormous numbers,'' said Mr. Vanderhoef. ''For them, this is a small issue; for us, it's big. If you're doing bottom-line stuff, Rockland has to fight harder and yell louder.''</p>
        <p>Christopher Boylan, the M.T.A.'s deputy executive director, said  Rockland's size had not been a factor in decisions. The M.T.A. has continued to improve its services, he said, including pledging $41 million over the next five years to expand and refurbish train service west of the Hudson in Rockland and Orange. In addition, the M.T.A. has contributed $53 million to New Jersey Transit for a train station in Secaucus that will be used as a transfer point by Rockland residents commuting to New York City. ''There are periods when member counties may get more than they put in, and some periods when they may put in more,'' he said. ''When they put in money, it's for the benefit of the mobility of the entire region.''</p>
        <p>Rockland's citizens have not always defended their local interests so vigorously, and they say their county has suffered for that. First, the Tappan Zee Bridge ushered in traffic and pollution. Then, industries created environmental problems.</p>
        <p>The federal Environmental Protection Agency has designated 4 Superfund sites in Rockland (compared with 2 in Westchester and 15 in Nassau) over the last two decades. While one of the Rockland sites has been fully cleaned, the others remain hazardous. At the newest site in Hillburn, Hudson Technologies spilled 7,500 pounds of freon last year that made its way into the drinking-water supply. Four wells had to be closed.</p>
        <p>''I feel like I'm at ground zero again,'' said Geoff Welch, a musician who moved to Ramapo in 1981 to escape the pollution and crowds of Manhattan only to spend his free time researching Rockland's environmental issues. ''That's why I'm standing my ground and fighting. I could move further out, but the same thing would happen all over again.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Welch and many others have banded together to preserve their way of life from the dual threats of development and the ambitions of fellow Rockland citizens. In the villages of South Nyack and Nyack, many residents are fighting a proposed expansion of the Tappan Zee Bridge in their backyard. But elsewhere in the county, others say it would help alleviate congestion. A state task force appointed by Governor Pataki has advocated replacing the aging structure with a wider, $4 billion bridge and rail system to accommodate the growing traffic.</p>
        <p>In Ramapo, a dozen community groups are trying to block construction of two power plants that they say would drain their water supply and ruin their view of Torne Mountain, a  spot immortalized by the Hudson River School painters. Yet, at the same time, two other power plants proposed for the town of Haverstraw have received a much different welcome. Many residents there say the plants will generate more jobs and  income from taxes.</p>
        <p>Such contradictory impulses have divided Rockland's citizens and perplexed outsiders who do not know what to make of the mixed signals. Does the county want growth and more transportation links to New York City? Or does it really want to hold on to the last vestiges of a rural life that once thrived here? There seems to be no consensus.</p>
        <p>On a recent afternoon, Mr. Welch and his neighbors in Ramapo showed off a billboard warning: ''Stop the power plants. Once it's up, it's over.'' But several of the neighbors hastened to add that they were not trying to stop economic growth, just the problems that come along with it.</p>
        <p>''People zip by on the highway and they don't realize the history and the wildlife in this county,'' said Mr. Welch as he pointed with pride to the craggy peak of Torne Mountain rising above low-lying buildings. ''We have a lot of work to do to bring it to their attention and give it the respect it deserves.''</p>
