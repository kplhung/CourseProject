        <p>Katherine Dunham is getting ready for a photo shoot. The radiant star of countless international dance tours and Broadway and Hollywood musicals from the 1940's on, scrutinizes the face staring back at her in the mirror. She combs her hair, now short and gray, and expertly applies her makeup. A friend helps her into a long blue-black velvet dress studded with small dark stars, created for her by a young Haitian designer named Cyril. Books are everywhere.

        <p>Katherine Dunham is getting ready for a photo shoot. The radiant star of countless international dance tours and Broadway and Hollywood musicals from the 1940's on, scrutinizes the face staring back at her in the mirror. She combs her hair, now short and gray, and expertly applies her makeup. A friend helps her into a long blue-black velvet dress studded with small dark stars, created for her by a young Haitian designer named Cyril. Books are everywhere. The television is tuned permanently to CNN.</p>
        <p>Ms. Dunham talks about real estate and the royal succession in Ghana, sipping what she refers to teasingly as ''that Old Devil Coca-Cola,'' undiluted, sadly, by rum. The conversation is punctuated by asides to her scampering 2-year-old goddaughter, Rose Michele, who perplexes Ms. Dunham by calling her ''Madam.''</p>
        <p>At 91 Ms. Dunham brims with more ideas and serene enthusiasm for life than anyone around her in the bustling Manhattan apartment where she is staying, on a sabbatical from her home in East St. Louis, Ill.</p>
        <p>This week she will teach classes and participate in a public ''conversation'' tomorrow afternoon in a studio at City Center, whose education department is holding an ambitious weeklong Dunham Institute for dance educators, with daily public panel discussions on Dunham dance this afternoon through Friday.</p>
        <p>Although she uses a wheelchair, Ms. Dunham leads a busy life. She participates frequently in seminars and is at work on the next installment of her autobiography, to be called ''The Minefield.'' She will soon be involved in the renovation of her theater museum in East St. Louis, where she also maintains a school.</p>
        <p>On June 22, her birthday, Ms. Dunham was presented with a check for $1 million by Illinois State Representative Wyvetter Younge, who had lobbied for the state funds. The money will be used to match a $1 million capital improvement grant from the Doris Duke Foundation. ''We still don't know about operating costs for the next year,'' said Jeanelle Stovall, a longtime colleague and friend of Ms. Dunham.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Dunham is pleased at this renewed attention to her work. ''It's almost for the accomplishment and furtherance of my dreams,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Not bad for a woman old enough to chide an admiring middle-aged visitor gently about accepting age and embracing wisdom. ''I don't like that 'accept,' '' she said firmly. ''I would just let the whole thing go. Just be there for it, centimeter by centimeter.''</p>
        <p>But then Ms. Dunham has confounded expectations all her life. A black child raised in Joliet, Ill., in the 1920's, she went on to earn a doctorate in anthropology at the University of Chicago, become the dance director for the Negro Unit of the Federal Theater Project in Chicago in 1938 and soon after achieve international fame as a dancer, choreographer and stage and film performer.</p>
        <p>She created a technique, a rich amalgam of Afro-Caribbean dance, ballet and modern dance, passed along at her influential school in the New York theater district in the mid-1940's and 50's. Then she seemed to disappear, settling in East St. Louis in 1967 to teach dance at Southern Illinois University and establish her school and museum in the bitterly impoverished town.</p>
        <p>''Everything was needed,'' Ms. Dunham said. ''Factories were closing. But it still had a family life. All of a sudden I found myself closing out my theater career and using my background in anthropology to bring together a community, not only to be preserved but developed.'' Her pupils have included the athletes Florence Griffith Joyner and Jackie Joyner Kersee and the filmmakers Reginald and Warrington Hudlin.</p>
        <p>''The time went by when I took up my serious living in East St. Louis,'' Ms. Dunham said. ''It's a section of my life that I will someday maybe put on paper. People tend to take things for granted sometimes, which they did with us. But finally that pays off. Without knowing it, you find yourself a part of the fabric of the place. I don't know when or how it happened. But the idea of leaving there now is very foreign to me. I couldn't. That's home.''</p>
        <p>She is in New York at the suggestion of Harry Belafonte and his wife, Julie, a former Dunham dancer. Ms. Dunham had come to lecture. Ms. Dunham recalled that the Belafontes said: ''Why not stay in New York for a time? You haven't even started your life.''</p>
        <p>''And all of a sudden, I said, 'Maybe you're right,' '' Ms. Dunham continued.</p>
        <p>''Wasn't it wonderful? I didn't feel like a dancer anymore. I began looking at my life and seeing that I had been living it in stages. And I sat down and figured where I was now. Well, there are nine stages in yoga. I've gone through all those. I don't want to have to prove it, but I know it's true. Ten was terrible, just awful. And now I'm moving into 11. And it's a challenge.</p>
        <p>''When you live your life that way, you don't really have much relationship to the levels before. If I stand here and look backwards, nostalgia sets in. And nostalgia is the deadly killer of our dreams. Memory, good, if it serves a purpose. But stay away from nostalgia.''</p>
        <p>When Ms. Dunham worried about the expense of living in New York, the Belafontes helped find money for her year away. ''Not only that,'' Ms. Dunham said, ''but it was done in such a way that I did not have a feeling at all that I was derelict and they were saving me.''</p>
        <p>Conversations with Ms. Dunham tend to range widely, scattered with allusions to everything from genomes and Haitian political history to witches and the plight of American children. ''Without knowing it, we've left children out of the whole picture, and it's beginning to give us trouble now,'' she said. She would like, she said laughing, to set the record straight on another matter. ''Someone told me a few days ago that I was still looked upon as a witch here,'' she said. ''Maybe by people who don't understand if it's going to rain, you say it's going to rain.''</p>
        <p>Looking back on her life, unnostalgically, she talks of discovering Haiti in the mid-1930's, when she went there to do research on Haitian dance for her master's degree. She recalls her delight, after experiencing racism as a high school student, in seeing black senators in tail coats governing Haiti.</p>
        <p>She bought property in Haiti, intending that the estate, now in disarray, would one day be a school and a retirement home for her dancers. ''There could be a relationship between people who had gained their freedom,'' she said of the Haitians, ''and people who had been given their freedom, as we were in this country.''</p>
        <p>It was time for the photo session. She gazed warmly into the camera, those famously lustrous eyes seeming to grow wider by the second. ''Did you ever see photographs of elderly divas trying to look sexy?'' she asked wryly.</p>
        <p>To what does she attribute her long life? Ms. Dunham was silent for a moment. Could it be yogurt? ''Actually, I don't like yogurt very much,'' Ms. Dunham said seriously. ''Well, you have to do two things. One is to try really to know yourself, and that takes time and patience. And you have to give so much, and know what people need, to know yourself.''</p>
