        <p>Manager Joe Torre said this afternoon that he was not counting on Mel Stottlemyre, the pitching coach, to return to the Yankees during the coming homestand. But Torre also said that Stottlemyre, who is being treated for bone marrow cancer, had mentioned the possibility of resuming his duties during the road trip that begins Aug. 25.</p>
        <p>Stottlemyre began the more intensive part of his treatment during the Yankees' last homestand, leaving the team on Aug. 7 and returning for one afternoon three days later, when David Cone broke his losing streak.</p>
        <p>Stottlemyre is essentially dictating his work schedule to Torre and the Yankees; when Stottlemyre is not available, then Billy Connors, a club vice president and former major league pitching coach, is assuming his duties.</p>
        <p>''He's talking about possibly going on the next road trip,'' Torre said. ''Part of it is the immune system, and at what point are they going to allow him to be around people. It's not that he feels bad; it's just that when they do certain things, it affects your immune system. As I say, he feels fine. I don't know when the prospects are as to when they're going to allow him'' to return to coaching.</p>
        <p>''As long as I can talk to him and confer with him,'' Torre added, ''that's what I need.''</p>
        <p>Torre also said: ''We're fortunate to have someone like Billy, who's been on top of everything since Day 1, even before I got here. It's not like he's coming in cold. He was with us the whole spring.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees' starters were pounded Friday and Saturday in consecutive losses as Connors watched from the bench. ''Poor guy, we'd better win a game,'' Torre joked. ''He'd be more comfortable if we were winning. We're doing everything we can to make him feel comfortable.''</p>
        <p>Stottlemyre has asked reporters to respect his privacy and does not discuss his treatment; Torre has shared only vague details about it.</p>
        <p>A Brain Cramp</p>
        <p>Before each night game that he pitches, Denny Neagle has a ritual of going to a theater to watch a movie. After the Anaheim Angels hammered him for six runs, including two home runs, in one and two-thirds innings during their 9-6 victory on Saturday, Neagle was asked what movie he saw before the game.</p>
        <p>He looked up, searching his memory for five seconds. Ten. Fifteen. ''I can't believe this,'' Neagle said, appalled at his lack of recall.</p>
        <p>Twenty seconds passed, a crowd of reporters circled around Neagle, waiting for him to remember the movie he had seen six hours before.</p>
        <p>Finally, after about a half-minute, it came to him. '' 'Space Cowboys,' '' he said firmly. ''Jeez, I was even trying to get a picture in my mind of who was in the movie. That's really bad -- if I can't tell you a movie and who was in it, then that means I'm really having an off night. That's what type of night it's been for me. Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, they haven't done anything in their careers.''</p>
        <p>Neagle's command against the Angels was awful, and others noticed how fidgety he was on the mound. ''It looked to me like he wasn't comfortable out there,'' Manager Joe Torre said.</p>
        <p>Said Neagle, ''From the get-go, I felt foreign out there on the mound.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees' contract discussions with Neagle began July 12, the day he was acquired from the Cincinnati Reds, in a cursory manner and have progressed a bit; Neagle is looking for a four-year deal for something in the range of $9 million a season, and the Yankees will most likely work something out, assuming his current three-game losing streak does not become habit.</p>
        <p>Some players hate to have contract negotiations during the season because they feel the pressure to justify their bargaining stance in every game. Neagle does not believe the contract talks are hurting him.</p>
        <p>''That hasn't played into my head at all,'' he said, after his loss Saturday. ''If that was the case, I would've probably had a game like this in my first couple of starts with these guys. You come over to the Yankees, there's big expectations, and this is my free agent year. If I had let that play into my head, I feel it would've happened in my first couple of starts.''</p>
        <p>Who's in Left?</p>
        <p>Glenallen Hill bruised his right shoulder when he ran into the wall while chasing a double down the left-field line Saturday, but he felt fine  today and was able to lift his arm to shoulder level. ''A lot could happen in 24 hours,'' Hill said late Saturday night, speaking hopefully of a fast recovery. ''Say some prayers, do some voodoo on it, cut a couple of chicken feet. I think I'll be all right.''</p>
        <p>Hill's injury, which appears to be minor, is another example of why the acquisition of Jose Canseco has complicated Joe Torre's decisions about who plays left field. Hill, who has slugged six homers in only 37 at-bats with the Yankees, normally would not play left field, and now he is hurt. David Justice is bothered by nagging leg problems, and he was forced to finish the game in left field Saturday. He was in the starting lineup in left for tonight's game, with Canseco as the designated hitter.</p>
        <p>Torre will have more options for left field after the rosters expand Sept. 1.</p>
        <p>''There's not much we can do,'' he said. ''What is the day, the 12th -- we'll deal with this another two and a half weeks. We'll make it.''</p>
