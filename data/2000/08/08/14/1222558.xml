        <p>A banner identifies the bustling warren of streets in this southern Chinese city as the New Garden Village Meat and Vegetable Market. And, indeed, one can find meat and produce in many varieties -- fresh or cured, hanging from hooks or still squawking in cages.</p>
        <p>At first, it looks like just another Chinese town, but not on closer inspection.</p>
        <p>New Garden Village is one of China's most notorious ''concubine villages.'' Hundreds of mainland Chinese women here live in a dozen rows of drab, concrete high-rises, kept there as mistresses or common-law wives of Hong Kong men. On a recent evening they prowled the market -- incongruously clad in skin-tight black pants and clingy tops -- buying groceries for dinner.</p>
        <p>Nearby, a real estate agent hawked cheap apartments on the order of glorified motel rooms.</p>
        <p>''You can rent by the month,'' she said, winking at a passer-by and the woman with him.</p>
        <p>Of all the ties that bind Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland, there may be few more pervasive than sex. The link is not largely fueled by quick thrills and anonymous encounters, though both are readily available. Rather, it is based on a remarkably durable web of relationships that have flowered between relatively poor Chinese women and more affluent Hong Kong men, whose jobs require them to spend days or weeks at a time in the mainland.</p>
        <p>Even before Hong Kong reverted to Chinese rule in 1997, the border between the two had become increasingly porous. Hong Kong companies set up scores of factories in cities like Dongguan, dispatching managers to oversee the assembly lines and truck drivers to haul goods to and fro.</p>
        <p>Whether to soothe their loneliness, stroke their egos or indulge their fantasies, many of these commuters support mistresses or de facto second wives. Concubine villages have sprouted up across Guangdong Province.</p>
        <p>To some of these Lotharios, having a mistress is a totem of success -- proof that they can afford to maintain two households. Granted, the cost of housing in Guangdong is a fraction of that in Hong Kong. Two-bedroom apartments in New Garden Village rent for as little as $195 a month.</p>
        <p>Beyond the affordability of the practice, anthropologists say it is deeply rooted in Chinese culture: the emperors had their concubines, Mao was famous for his serial conquests and traders kept spouses in every port. In Hong Kong, even when it was a rule-bound British colony, concubines were legal until 1971.</p>
        <p>But now the Chinese government is starting to view wholesale adultery as a social menace, and it is cracking down.</p>
        <p>In July, the Guangdong authorities sentenced a Hong Kong man to 10 months in jail for living in ''factual bigamy.'' The man, Choi Kai-pang, had a wife in Hong Kong but lived with a mainland woman in the border city of Shenzhen. The couple even had a phony Chinese marriage certificate.</p>
        <p>Men who do not pretend to be married to their mistresses are only slightly less at risk. Guangdong recently changed its laws to make longterm cohabitation by unmarried couples a crime. Although a single act of adultery is not illegal, a man who lives with a woman to whom he is not married can be sent to a labor camp for two years.</p>
        <p>''The government is taking measures to prohibit this behavior because the affairs have caused family problems and violence,'' said Paulina C. Y. Kwok, a social worker with the charity Caritas Hong Kong, who counsels the wives of wayward men. ''They say it goes against Chinese values.''</p>
        <p>Women's groups in China contend that the proliferation of extramarital sex corrodes the Chinese family. Though the problem is most acute in freewheeling southern China, mass migration and economic dislocation have made infidelity a problem across the country. The children who result from these liaisons also make Beijing's family-planning policies less effective, prompting some legal experts to call for marriage laws that mandate cohabitation with one's spouse.</p>
        <p>The changes will not come soon enough for Mrs. Lam, a Hong Kong woman who says her 26-year marriage has been devastated by her husband's philandering on the mainland. She declined to give her full name to avoid embarrassment. Four years ago, the couple moved to a village in Guangdong to start a fish-breeding farm. Mr. Lam visited karaoke bars, where he met young women from rural China who worked as prostitutes.</p>
        <p>When Mrs. Lam returned to Hong Kong for a lengthy medical procedure in 1997, her husband secretly took a mistress, she said. He rented a cozy apartment for the woman in a neighboring town and lent her his wife's clothes. In addition to rent, Mr. Lam paid the woman several thousand dollars.</p>
        <p>''These mainland women have beautiful skin and pretty faces,'' Mrs. Lam said, her face creased with sorrow and bitterness. ''They know how to please another woman's husband. They do it for economic stability.''</p>
        <p>To save her marriage, Mrs. Lam, 48, demanded that her husband move back to Hong Kong. But recently she discovered he had taken up with yet another woman. She contends that the morals of Guangdong have corrupted Mr. Lam, making him believe that mistresses are the social norm.</p>
        <p>Indeed, in some ways, the concubine village here seems less a red-light district than a starter community. Women wheel babies, stopping to browse for kitchen utensils. Children scamper around a leafy park.</p>
        <p>But there are reminders that New Garden Village is no Mayberry. Next to the kitchen shop is a beauty salon, where little hair was being cut. Instead, three heavily made-up young women loitered on a divan, waiting for customers.</p>
        <p>One Hong Kong factory manager who has commuted to China since 1993 predicts the new laws will not curb the problem. For one thing, the police will arrest a man on charges of bigamy or illegal cohabitation only if a complaint is lodged against him here. Hong Kong and China are separate legal jurisdictions.</p>
        <p>A Hong Kong woman who wants to haul her husband into a Chinese court must also make sure that the state can prove he is living with a mistress -- not easy to do in the rent-by-the-month world of concubine villages.</p>
        <p>Still, many in Hong Kong are sure to welcome the crackdown. The territory has watched nervously as its men have sired a generation of illegitimate children -- 520,000 by one estimate -- with one foot in the mainland and one in Hong Kong. Last year, a local court briefly granted those children residency in Hong Kong; the ruling was overturned by the Chinese government.</p>
        <p>''If men are in danger of going to prison, they may control their impulses,'' said Ms. Kwok, the social worker.</p>
        <p>But she added that laws alone would not solve the problem. China, she said, must improve the status of women, particularly the young, penniless ones who pour in from the hinterland. ''If these women can get real jobs, if their status in society improves, they won't get into this business to begin with,'' Ms. Kwok said.</p>
