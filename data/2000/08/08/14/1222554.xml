        <p>When you watch President Clinton at the Democratic convention, it may look as if he is stealing President Ronald Reagan's script from 1988.

As Mr. Reagan did then, Mr. Clinton is expected to implore Americans to build on the triumphs of the current administration.</p>
        <p>As was the case 12 years ago, members of the party faithful are a bit edgy about their ticket and grouse that their new standard-bearer is not nearly as dynamic as the man he wants to replace.

        <p>When you watch President Clinton at the Democratic convention, it may look as if he is stealing President Ronald Reagan's script from 1988. As Mr. Reagan did then, Mr. Clinton plans to bless his No. 2 officially on Monday evening. As Mr. Reagan did then, Mr. Clinton is expected to implore Americans to build on the triumphs of the current administration.</p>
        <p>As was the case 12 years ago, members of the party faithful are a bit edgy about their ticket and grouse that their new standard-bearer is not nearly as dynamic as the man he wants to replace. While Mr. Reagan savored a 54 percent job approval rating in the New York Times/CBS News Poll on the eve of his party's convention in 1988 -- impressive for a lame duck -- Mr. Clinton's stands even higher, at 61 percent.</p>
        <p>Yet for all the apparent similarities, the two presidents' approaches toward their valedictory appearances could not have been more different. While Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton have been roundly accused of hogging the spotlight from his vice president, Mr. Reagan drew plaudits for how he choreographed the passing of power in his party.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Clinton popped up in Los Angeles on Friday for fund-raisers and appearances that drowned out the attention -- and complicated fund-raising -- for Al Gore, Mr. Reagan did not arrive in New Orleans until the Sunday before the convention 12 years ago.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reagan pulled off what was widely described as a sentimental, nostalgic and certainly graceful journey. He was greeted at a rally in New Orleans to shouts of ''Four more years! Four more years!'' Delegates wiped tears from their eyes as the president at the convention hailed the party for lighting ''a prairie fire'' that he said transformed the nation. He promised never to bid a final goodbye.</p>
        <p>By contrast, the gossip among delegates, lobbyists and hangers-on here was whether Mr. Clinton would ever -- or even should -- say goodbye.</p>
        <p>Even as they acknowledged that Mr. Clinton is dominating the ramp up to the convention, many delegates sounded wistful about his leaving the White House. Some said they did not view Mr. Gore as alluring a leader.</p>
        <p>''We all know that if there were not term limits, Bill Clinton would be running for president again,'' said Martha Aasen, a delegate from Westport, Conn. ''Gore doesn't turn me on. He's different. He's sincere. He knows the issues, but he's different.'' She was glad, she said, that Mr. Gore was not speaking until three days after Mr. Clinton, so there will not be back-to-back comparisons.</p>
        <p>Roger Short, a delegate from Detroit, took issue with those who are eager for Mr. Clinton to leave. ''He's still the president and has every right to be here,'' he said. ''He raises a lot of money that other Democrats are certainly willing to take. Let's not beat the guy up for his mistakes in the White House.''</p>
        <p>The difference, of course, between the Clinton and Reagan models is that while Vice President George Bush tried to distance himself from Mr. Reagan on the Iran-contra case, he did not have to worry about being connected to anything approaching the embarrassment of Mr. Clinton's personal scandals. So Mr. Gore is faced with the far more confounding task of trying to take credit for the booming economy encouraged by the current administration but not wanting to be linked to the baggage.</p>
        <p>Joe Andrew, the Democratic national chairman, said the party studied Mr. Reagan's approach in 1988 but decided that Mr. Clinton had a different place in his party.</p>
        <p>''Most people would see the transfer in 1988 as being successful; it was gracefully done,'' Mr. Andrew said. ''But there was a very different goal. They wanted George Bush to be Ronald Reagan.''</p>
        <p>Asked then if the Democratic Party did not want Al Gore to be Bill Clinton, he demurred, saying, ''We want Al Gore to simply be Al Gore.''</p>
        <p>It is especially striking that Mr. Clinton has been ridiculed for pulling attention from Mr. Gore given that he has been much more aggressive in helping his vice president than was Mr. Reagan. In fact, Mr. Reagan's endorsement of Mr. Bush was so feeble -- almost like an afterthought -- that he had to clarify his comments the next day.</p>
        <p>Robert M. Teeter, who was a top strategist for Mr. Bush, said Mr. Clinton's transgressions are a horrible burden for the vice president. ''We had the challenge of Bush having to establish himself in his own right,'' he said. ''In Gore's case, it's a very difficult strategy because the economy's in pretty good shape but people want a change. There's real tension.''</p>
        <p>David Leland, the chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, said he understands the political need for Mr. Clinton to depart on Tuesday to leave the stage for Mr. Gore. That doesn't mean he is happy about it.</p>
        <p>''I'm in the same hotel as Bill Clinton and I'd love to have him stay around,'' Mr. Leland said. ''We can go out and shoot pool, go have steaks. Whatever.''</p>
