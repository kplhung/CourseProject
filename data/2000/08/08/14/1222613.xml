        <p>THE passerby sees the headlights of a parked automobile and opens the door to turn them off when he is arrested for car theft. A guy goes to light the cigarette of a woman, and as she bends forward her hair catches fire. You volunteer to hammer a nail into the wall for a friend, and the plaster collapses.</p>
        <p>''Sir,'' Samuel Johnson once said, ''the road to hell is paved with good intentions.''</p>
        <p>Enter Jack Golden. Poor Jack Golden. Put another brick on that road, Jack.</p>
        <p>Maybe you've already heard about Jack Golden -- Good Samaritan, Team Player, Alleged Schnook.</p>
        <p>Maybe you saw some of the headlines in Saturday's newspapers that followed Jack Golden and the final play of the Giants football game against Jacksonville: ''Good Start Turns Awful for Giants,'' ''For Golden, Giant Gaffe,'' and ''Jints Chill Out on Golden Goof.'' And maybe somewhere else there was: ''Golden Opportunity Fizzles.''</p>
        <p>Jack Golden, a 23-year-old rookie linebacker fresh out of Oklahoma State, is trying to realize a dream and stick with the Big Blue. He understands that he must impress the coaches, primarily the head coach, Jim Fassel.</p>
        <p>''Coach Fassel talked all week about needing to play smart,'' Golden said after Friday night's preseason game in Jacksonville, ''and as soon as I came to the sidelines I looked in his eyes and I said, 'I messed up.' I was trying to be smart and wasn't.''</p>
        <p>Return with us now to that fateful moment: Giants are leading, 13-9, with seven seconds left in the last quarter. While this game doesn't count in the standing, it would still be a morale booster for the Giants to beat a Super Bowl contender. So in what may be the final play of the game, cornerback Fred Lewis, Golden's fellow rookie on the Giants, intercepts a pass a foot or so in front of the goal line. He starts to run with the ball instead of taking a step back and dropping to one knee in the end zone.</p>
        <p>Yes, it would give the Jaguars 2 points for a safety, but so what? The Giants would still win, 13-11. By running around -- he did step back into the end zone but only to run crossfield -- he was jeopardizing a fumble, a Jags recovery and a potential touchdown that would send our heroes to Loserville.</p>
        <p>Obviously, in the heat of battle, in the searing split seconds of battle, Lewis doesn't compute all this. But guess who does? You got it: Golden. Golden ventures what any far-thinking, well-meaning citizen in shoulder pads and face mask would. He tackles Lewis! Lewis, not expecting friendly fire, fumbles. Guess who recovers the ball in the end zone? No, not Golden, but Brandon Christenson, who does not wear a white jersey, but a teal one. Giants lose, 16-13.</p>
        <p>''Holy smokes!'' Fassel said after the game, among other exclamations. And when asked to explain what occurred on that play, he said, ''Lord only knows why. . . .''</p>
        <p>Too facile. What he should have said was: ''Golden made an outstanding play, a smart play. Einstein-ian even. Ball just took a bad bounce.''</p>
        <p>You're supposed to know the rules, and Golden obviously did. While the result wasn't what a Giants partisan wishes for, it is still a pleasure to see brains exercised with brawn -- though, yes, in this case an eager rookie upon contact demonstrated a little too much brawn.</p>
        <p>From the little leagues on up, an athlete is instructed to consider what he would do if the ball is hit to him, or if the football spirals his way, or if he snares a squirming basketball. Yet too often we see the reverse in players who should know better, but don't.</p>
        <p>Like Benny Agbayani's blunder Saturday night -- catching a fly ball in left field in the fourth inning and, thinking there were three outs instead of two, giving the ball to a boy in the stands. That allowed two runs to score for San Francisco and gave the Giants a 2-1 lead. The Mets finally won, 3-2. Agbayani said he had misread the scoreboard. The coaching staff may want to equip him with a cell phone to stay in touch.</p>
        <p>I've also seen a Knicks player try to save a ball going out of bounds under his own basket and throw it to the other team for a score. We've seen a star college player call for a timeout in the crucial final seconds of a game in which his team was out of timeouts, thus garnering a technical foul and giving significant free throws to the opponent.</p>
        <p>Sometimes it is true, as noted elsewhere, that the best laid plans do go awry. Like the man in Los Angeles who boarded a plane thinking he was going to Oakland, Calif., and wound up in Auckland, New Zealand.</p>
        <p>Or the saga of Jim Marshall, a defensive end for the Vikings, who scooped up a fumble against the 49ers in 1964 and raced 66 yards to the end zone. On the sideline, Fran Tarkenton, the Vikings' quarterback, ran nearly the whole distance yelling and waving to Marshall. The crowd was screaming so loud Marshall couldn't quite catch Tarkenton's words. He thought it was simply to cheer him on. What Tarkenton was hollering was, ''Go back, you fool you, go back!'' Jim had run the wrong way.</p>
        <p>Then there's the reverse -- unplanned good fortune: Christopher Columbus spotting land and shouting: ''India! India! At last, India!'' And a man named Crawford Long coming upon the idea for surgical anesthesia after hurting himself and feeling no pain while stoned on ether at a party. Of somewhat less historical significance, I've seen a guy throw a bad pass that bounced off a teammate's head and into the basket.</p>
        <p>Some, now, have wondered if Golden's tackle would sink the Giants into despair. More likely, it makes the Giants a better team, a smarter team. Is there not a man on the squad who won't be thinking before every snap what options he has? Rather than be Jack Golden, they'd rather not be Fred Lewis.</p>
        <p>A Yiddish proverb goes, ''Better to lose with a wise man than win with a fool.'' Because, goes the belief, the next time -- everything equal -- the wise man will win.</p>
        <p>For the Giants, it may indeed prove to be the Golden rule.</p>
