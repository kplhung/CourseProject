        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>I was sitting in the front of one of those new double-length 79th Street crosstown buses heading west when a young woman got on and sat in the first seat behind the driver. Her cell phone rang. She answered and then looked to the back of the bus and waved. Seated across from her, I was privy to the conversation and this is what transpired.</p>
        <p>The man she had waved at, obviously a friend who knew her number, was calling her from the far rear of the bus. After exchanging pleasantries, she explained that she was sitting in the front because she was going to Park Avenue and as there was no stop there, she was getting off at Lexington. Leaving by the front door was closer for her.</p>

        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>I was sitting in the front of one of those new double-length 79th Street crosstown buses heading west when a young woman got on and sat in the first seat behind the driver. Her cell phone rang. She answered and then looked to the back of the bus and waved. Seated across from her, I was privy to the conversation and this is what transpired.</p>
        <p>The man she had waved at, obviously a friend who knew her number, was calling her from the far rear of the bus. After exchanging pleasantries, she explained that she was sitting in the front because she was going to Park Avenue and as there was no stop there, she was getting off at Lexington. Leaving by the front door was closer for her.</p>
        <p>He was also getting off at Lexington but since he was going to the Lexington Avenue subway, the back exit was closer for him. Neither one considered moving seats.</p>
        <p>As they approached Lexington, they said their cell phone goodbyes: the young woman signed off with, ''Next time we're on a bus together, give me a call.'' They both got off and went their separate ways. They had saved a few steps and missed any personal contact.</p>

        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>Brooklyn friends define ''nanosecond'' as the amount of time that lapses between traffic lights turning green and someone honking his horn.</p>
        <p>I had a recent example of that as I was driving down Franklin Street. The traffic light at the next intersection turned amber and I slowly came to a stop. There was a single car waiting at the cross street -- no cars in front or behind. But, like Pavlov's dog, as soon as the light turned green, the driver honked his horn, then quickly made a left turn and drove away. I wonder if he even realized what he had done.</p>

        <p>A month before prom time, Bee Johnson spotted a freshwater pearl necklace, bracelet and earrings that she thought would be a perfect gift for her 17-year-old granddaughter, Claire Johnson. The traditional thank-you letter she received went on to say:</p>
        <p>''Today I had the incredible surprise of finding out that I was going to get to eat breakfast with Dennis Hastert, the speaker of the House. I was just wondering what jewelry I should wear when your package came. It couldn't have been better timing! I'm not getting too dressed up, though; I knew you wouldn't approve of me getting all dressed up for a Republican!!''</p>
        <p>The advice offered on the sign seen by Diana Binder in the window of Schatzie's Prime Meats on Madison Avenue might be worth considering:</p>
        <p>Invest in our stocks:</p>
        <p>Chicken stock</p>
        <p>Veal stock</p>
        <p>Beef stock</p>
        <p>Lamb stock.</p>
        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>It was one of those very hot days and the Long Island Rail Road car, still at Pennsylvania Station, was sweltering.</p>
        <p>Cadets from the Police Academy, still dressed in their uniforms and with duffle and garment bags scattered about, were in the car where I was sitting. They were all basically slumped over, overheated and exhausted, holding water bottles and barely speaking to one another.</p>
        <p>Just as the train doors were closing, a young, attractive woman got on, her hair pulled up with beautiful ornaments, wearing a flowered minidress and high-heeled sandals. The heat hadn't seemed to affect her. Her face lit up as spotted the young men. ''Oh, wow!'' she exclaimed. ''Are you guys cadets from the Police Academy?''</p>
        <p>The young man who replied didn't move a muscle. ''No, we just like wearing polyester,'' he said.</p>

        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>It was a bright and cool day when I saw a small elderly woman, somewhat shabby but neat, leaning on a late-model Cadillac, holding a paper coffee cup. She looked very much like my long-departed mother and I couldn't help but smile at her. She returned the smile. My eyes began to fill  with impending tears. I dug into my pocket and gathered about $2 worth of quarters saved for street telephone use, walked up to her and emptied the coins in her container. To my horror -- and hers -- the container was filled with coffee. She had a few words for me that I know my mother would never have used. I stood motionless as she opened the car door and drove away, leaving the spilled container and the coins at my feet. Beware of bearing unwanted gifts.</p>

        <p>Dorothy Gunzenhauser is 5 feet 1 inch tall and accustomed to sitting behind taller people at the theater. She had a center orchestra aisle seat for a recent performance of ''Copenhagen,'' and true to her luck, the man in front of her was about 6 feet 3 inches with a large head and broad back. She spent the first act weaving back and forth in an effort to keep up with the action.</p>
        <p>At intermission, the man turned to her and asked if she was having difficulty seeing. When she said she was, the woman he was with turned around and said, ''I know your problem,'' and insisted that Ms. Gunzenhauser change seats with her. The second act was enjoyed without stress.</p>
        <p>''I am a born and bred New Yorker currently living in Newtown, Pa.,'' she said. ''I keep telling my new Pennsylvania friends that beautiful things do happen in New York.</p>
        <p>Anne Kabak Schwalb was in a cab recently when the Pakistani driver started talking to her. Education was very important to him, he said. He had an advanced degree, as did his wife and three children, and he was very proud of them. He asked Ms. Schwalb her occupation and she told him she was a volunteer tutor for needy children. When she reached her destination, he not only refused her tip but even handed her a dollar and told her to buy something for them. The next time she took them on an outing, she gave each one money for a video game and made sure they knew about the driver.</p>
