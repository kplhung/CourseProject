        <p>Looking ahead to his first visit to the United States since winning Mexico's most democratic presidential election in 71 years, Vicente Fox said today that he would press American officials to open the border to Mexican workers and denounced the violence against them.</p>
        <p>The President-elect said that when he meets later this month with President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, he would also begin a dialogue about the formation of a North American common market. Referring to the successes of the European Union, Mr. Fox said that a common market would promote economic cooperation rather than competition.</p>
        <p>''We will never be that good friend, that good neighbor, that good partner as long as Mexico is lagging way behind in development,'' Mr. Fox said. ''I think it is a solidarity issue. It is a wisdom issue. It is a talent issue.</p>
        <p>''I don't think the market, by itself, will do the job,'' he went on. ''This job has to be done by the intelligence of people, by the intelligence of governments, by the talent of our nations.''</p>
        <p>Since his election, Mr. Fox has become a towering figure in Mexico, because he stands 6 foot 5 inches in his signature cowboy boots and because he is the first to seize the presidency from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, in power since 1929. It was clear that even Mr. Fox marvels at the accomplishment. He declared his election on July 2 a ''day of joy and happiness,'' and later showed off his quarter horse named for that date.</p>
        <p>Relaxed and talkative, speaking in English, the President-elect met with American reporters at his mother's sprawling colonial hacienda to discuss his ideas for addressing some of the most contentious grievances in Mexico's relationship with the United States, including immigration, the fight against drug trafficking and corruption. At many points throughout the 90-minute meeting, he spoke with a candor rare among Mexican politicians about his country's failings and its continuing need for foreign assistance, and he encouraged American officials to do the same when he meets Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore on Aug. 24, and Governor Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, the following day in Texas.</p>
        <p>In talking about immigration, Mr. Fox, a former executive for Coca-Cola in Mexico, called the labor force one of his nation's greatest assets. He said he would push for the creation of programs that would let  Mexicans hold temporary jobs legally in the United States -- from unskilled gardeners to computer programmers.</p>
        <p>''The United States also knows very well that it needs people to grow, that the United States economy cannot grow at rates of 5 percent or more if you don't have Mexicans there,'' Mr. Fox said.</p>
        <p>''It is a country that was built up by immigrants,'' he said of his northern neighbor. ''I don't know why today immigrants should be rejected.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox said he would tell Mr. Clinton that the violence against Mexican immigrants on American ranches along the border -- violence in which at least three immigrants have been killed this year -- is not fair.</p>
        <p>And, he added, ''we are more intelligent than to accept that as a fact.''</p>
        <p>He said he understood clearly that illegal immigration into the United States was largely caused by poverty, unemployment and hunger in Mexico, and in order to keep Mexican workers home, he said he intended to turn his campaign promises of 7 percent annual economic growth and 1.35 million new jobs a year into reality.</p>
        <p>''It is not possible to have a harmonious, stable border,'' he said. ''It is not possible to solve the migration problem if we don't solve the gap where a worker in Mexico earns $5 a day, and a worker in the United States makes $60 a day.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox went on: ''Migration can be handled with different alternatives. By building up walls, by putting up armies, by dedicating billions of dollars like every border state is doing to avoid migration, is not the way to go.''</p>
        <p>Instead of reinforcing the border, Mr. Fox proposes slowly tearing it down by expanding the North American Free Trade Agreement into a treaty that creates an open market and a freer flow of services, goods and workers.</p>
        <p>''In Europe, they don't compete within each other,'' he said, referring to the 15-nation European Union, in which citizens of any one country can work in any other member nation, and passport controls have also been largely abolished. ''The countries that are involved, they are partners, so they take all the advantages that each one has and they put them together.</p>
        <p>''I just can't imagine the huge potential of Mexico, the United States and Canada 20, 30, 40 years from now,'' he added. ''The capacity of this bloc of nations would be the best in the world. We three countries would be absolute winners.''</p>
        <p>He said he plans to seek similar open-market agreements among some of the members of Mercosur -- Brazil, Argentina and Chile. Mexico and these three nations, he said, could be ''the four machines'' that could move Latin America forward and make it a real power in the 21st century.</p>
        <p>Although he said that most of his meetings in Washington -- and in Dallas with Mr. Bush -- would be informal, he said he would strongly propose an end to the American drug-certification program. Under the program, the United States Congress annually certifies that Mexico and other individual Latin American countries where there is a substantial drug trade meet a set of standards for combating the illegal traffic. Those countries that do not meet the standards face an array of possible sanctions.</p>
        <p>The program has long been criticized by Latin American presidents as interventionist. Mr. Fox said he considered the program ineffective. ''It is not serving any purpose,'' he said. ''Drug trafficking is growing, drug consumption in the United States is growing, the introduction of drugs to the United States is growing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox also said that he would consider ''very positively'' American law enforcement efforts to win the extradition of suspected drug traffickers, an issue long the focus of acrimony between Mexico and Washington. And he promised that, under his government, it would be harder for criminals to bribe their way out of justice.</p>
        <p>Summing up his hopes for his American visit, he said: ''I want to approach the United States with intelligence. I don't want to approach it with pressures and complaints. I want to sit down with the United States and talk long term and short  term, and to build, not to destroy.''</p>
        <p>In a rare moment of evasiveness, Mr. Fox backed away from questions about which of the American presidential candidates seems more of a friend to Mexico.</p>
        <p>He said he had met previously with Mr. Bush, when Mr. Fox was governor of Guanajuato, and said he would meet Mr. Gore for the first time in Washington.</p>
        <p>Both candidates, he said, have appeared interested in improving relations with Mexico, even if only for political reasons.</p>
        <p>Asked to characterize relations between Mexico and the United States, he smiled and said: ''The thing I have always said is that it is a difficult relationship. Sometimes we declare love for each other, but sometimes we give bear hugs -- too tight an embrace, and so someone gets hurt.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 17, 2000, Thursday  An article on Monday about the planned United States visit of President-elect Vicente Fox of Mexico referred incorrectly in some copies to Guanajuato, the state where Mr. Fox served as governor. It does not border Texas.</p>
