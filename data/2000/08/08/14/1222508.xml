        <p>REMEMBER the last time you stopped in your tracks at the sight of the display in a bank branch window, lingering to window-shop or even drawn irresistibly through the door and into the bank to browse?</p>
        <p>Right.</p>
        <p>The 21st-century bank branch doesn't inspire impulse shopping, and it certainly doesn't attract people the way it did when banking required a face-to-face transaction with a teller. Most people now write checks, use credit cards, withdraw and deposit money through automated teller machines, or bank online. When they do go into a bank, they know what to expect -- a cluster of desks on one side, a long enclosed counter on the other and dead space in between for standing in line.</p>
        <p>The institutional setting has not changed much the last couple of decades, but now a group of designers at the Citicorp Development Center in Los Angeles has won a patent they hope will turn the bank branch into a shopping destination.</p>
        <p>Banks sell products and services, after all, and need to reach potential customers. The Citicorp inventors believe that if they can change the layout and function of bank branches, more people will be inspired to visit them.</p>
        <p>Imagine window-shopping among images flashing across a video wall and being lured into a bank branch by computer terminals offering Internet access, e-mail, home banking, television broadcasts, sports scores and local news. The wall is connected  with the terminals, so you and other customers can take over separate parts of the video exhibit. You can search for information to display on a section of the wall or on the individual terminal screen, or interact with an electronic mortgage seminar, or browse a calendar of banking classes and events.</p>
        <p>You can even send a message to someone at another terminal and ''grab and share'' information by moving images back and forth between the video wall and the computer screens.</p>
        <p>The point, still, is to help ''the banking institution sell services, by virtue of attracting customers and other users and initiating a dialogue,'' the inventors wrote in their patent application.</p>
        <p>''A sample event that occurs at the interactive center could include a tutorial on how to plan a trust,'' the application said. ''In addition, the interactive center could connect the customer with a legal firm that is partnered with the banking institution, or provide either a prerecorded video or display other information, such as relevant legal forms.''</p>
        <p>The patent describes a bank branch with a video wall and individual computer terminals.</p>
        <p>Some of the terminals are ''public,'' for use in connection with the video wall, while others are ''private,'' for use in personal banking. The computers feature access to a limited number of preselected Web sites relevant to banking and financial institutions. The sites are organized into categories like ''money management.''</p>
        <p>An archive of videotaped seminars is available for broadcast on the computer screen or the video wall. Each computer keyboard has a toolbar with navigation buttons leading to the bank home page, financial tools, promotions, a calendar for the interactive center, site links, and entertainment and community news. The topics can be changed to suit particular institutions or promotions.</p>
        <p>Bank customers can use the computer system by swiping an automated teller machine card or smart-card through an electronic card reader: potential customers can use a guest card. Once activated, most sessions are limited to five minutes.</p>
        <p>Sylvia Bornemisza-Wahr, Frank McCallick, Roy Sinai, Peter Paradiso, Howard Schechtman, Kenneth Randall, Peter Tompkins and Teresa Petach, who all live in the Los Angeles area, along with Kevin Lam, who lives in Singapore, won patent 6,073,119.</p>
        <p>Bank machine cards have always required a secret code known only to the card holder. At least, that is supposed to be the case. But people who are careless with their cards or their personal identification numbers, or PIN's, can compromise the security of their bank accounts. Now three Texas inventors have patented an A.T.M. system that doesn't use cards or codes at all.</p>
        <p>Michael Stinson, John Templer and Dyron Clower, who are all from Fort Worth, own a patent for a bank machine that compares what they call ''biometric information'' from a user with similar data on account holders.</p>
        <p>A video camera at a bank machine terminal would capture a picture of a user's face, iris or fingerprint for comparison with the same images stored in a customer database. A processor evaluates the two images, and when a match is confirmed, notifies the bank computer that the user  has been identified as the owner of the bank account or credit card. The three inventors won patent 6,045,039.</p>
        <p>Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.</p>
