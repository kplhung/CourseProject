        <p>AN OBEDIENT FATHER  By Akhil Sharma  282 pages. Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux. $23.</p>
        <p>''Don't cry even though you cry such handsome tears.''</p>
        <p>The bitter words belong to Radha, the wife of Ram Karan. On a holiday Ram had ignored her frantic telegrams about their first baby's illness, finally returning to Delhi only to dissolve in remorse when he finds that the child had died.</p>
        <p>Weeper of handsome tears: it perfectly sums up Akhil Sharma's cunning, dismaying and beautifully conceived portrait of a corrupt man in a corrupt society. For both, the corruption is double. On the surface it is a matter of arrangements, reprehensible but with a dose of comedy and forbearance.</p>
        <p>Ram is the uncomfortable but diligent bagman for a department head in India's education ministry. He makes the rounds of school principals, enjoying a good lunch with each and coming away with an oblong packet wrapped in newspaper. Bribes nourish him and his boss; they nourish the Congress Party that gave them their jobs and whose long rule, in the telling of ''An Obedient Father,'' is tightly woven into its intricate network of payoffs.</p>
        <p>So far, so bad; but perhaps so human as well. After all, India has avoided the extremes of dictatorship; and Ram is in many ways a nice man.</p>
        <p>Yet in the course of the 1947 partition, India and Pakistan saw hundreds of thousands of Hindus and Muslims slaughtered in a mutual massacre whose wounds -- Kashmir, extremist parties, two confronted sets of nuclear weapons -- may prove lethal once more. As for Ram, fat, tender and self-indulgent, he has committed the family equivalent of civil war genocide: the repeated nightly rape of his 12-year-old daughter, Anita. This was also in the past (she is now grown and keeps house for him) but, by the time the book ends, it has proven lethal once more.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sharma's novel weaves the national into the personal without a trace of the didactic. What is more astonishing is his success in joining the amiably picaresque aspects of the corruption -- India's and Ram's -- with the ghastly evil of its underside.</p>
        <p>There are the comically desultory dickerings and schemings among the ministry officials, the ill-fated attempt of Ram's boss to switch loyalty and bribes to the Congress Party's rivals, the mournful intimacy that develops between a police spy and the man whose telephone he is tapping. These are set among brief but haunting glimpses of a larger India: street scenes, lovely circular conversations, a bus ride from village to village. (The old men squatting by the roadside stand up at the bus's approach, but turn their backs to avoid humiliation in case it doesn't stop.)</p>
        <p>They are set, as well, among exhalations of charnel horror. A politician casually mentions his partition role in loading a train with thousands of dead Muslims and sending it north. A gang of Hindu toughs prepares to massacre the Sikh owners of a store after the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi. The wife emerges with two children, washed and dressed for school. A rickshaw driver ignores her terrified signal. It is a scene of sparse, tense anguish.</p>
        <p>Along comes Ram. He commandeers the rickshaw and sends off the woman and her children. A brave and decent act. But why is he out so early on streets all but deserted in the fear of rioting? To fetch a holy man on the anniversary of the death of his wife, Radha. Why the last-minute haste? To try to pacify Anita, whose long-repressed rage ignites in a slow, multistaged explosion that will destroy him.</p>
        <p>Years before, Radha had caught him with Anita. Screaming, she beat him all night, then sent their daughter to live with relatives, cautioning her to keep silent. Anita did, choking down her hatred and returning silently home with Asha, her little daughter, after her own husband's death. Then one night she finds Ram, tipsy after a party at the house of his boss, Mr. Gupta, holding Asha in an incipiently sexual embrace.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sharma's rendition of the confrontation is stunning dramatically, psychologically and in terms of the social constraints on Indian women. Anita is entirely dependent on Ram: the reversal that will turn him into the obedient (destroyed, more nearly) father of the title is like watching a building dynamited in slow motion from within. Here is Anita's first piteous stammer: ''Mr. Gupta's party . . . You were drunk . . . I don't want . . . I would kill Asha . . . I'm not joking . . . I would kill you . . . I can't go anywhere . . . I have no other home.''</p>
        <p>Ram's first response is to apologize and console, as if he still held that power. Over the days, as Anita grows into her fury, he shrinks. There is rationalization: ''The crime against Anita was decades old. Since then I had not repeated the crime with any other child. Asha did not count because I was drunk and had been caught before anything occurred.'' There is shame at what he did, but much more at being found out. ''I did not actually believe that I would ever be discovered, for I could not imagine the world after I had been caught.''</p>
        <p>The world changes unimaginably. Ram curses himself in the abasing words Anita requires; he pays her money and deeds her the apartment. An oddly logical truce breaks down in new shame, dramatized in a series of ghastly scenes that never lose their hold on the novel's disorienting blend of irony, compassion and cold moral gravity.</p>
        <p>''An Obedient Father'' is hard, as well as rich and enthralling. The initial rape scene is all but unbearable. (I think it was a mistake to excerpt it in a recent issue of The New Yorker, lifted from the novel's larger context.) Part of the hardness is a fix on moral issues somewhat divergent from that in much of Western literature (though the Greeks had it).</p>
        <p>Our tradition says, more or less: A person is evil and is or is not punished, at some point internalizing the evil in the person. Mr. Sharma's message is subtly different. Speaking with Andre Malraux once, Nehru let drop the phrase ''An evil act has evil consequences.'' It seems a tautology, but it is not. It steps back; it is unsentimental and oddly liberating; it doesn't need to forgive or condemn the person in order to lay the evil pitilessly bare, and to punish it.</p>
