        <p>In the stifling air of the MCI Center, 16,331 high-pitched screams brought the energy to a boiling point. With less than four minutes left in the first game of the Eastern Conference playoffs Saturday night in Washington, the Liberty and the host Mystics were deadlocked at 58-58.</p>
        <p>Something had to give or somebody had to take. Playing in pantomime on the hostile stage, the Liberty players, unable to hear each other during the final maddening minutes, relied on their sixth sense: experience.</p>
        <p>As the Mystics faltered under the Liberty's zone defense, the Liberty closed the game with a 14-5 run for a 72-63 victory and a 1-0 advantage in the three-of-five-game series.</p>
        <p>''Experience played a key for us because we've been there, we didn't let the crowd take us out of the game,'' said the Liberty co-captain and point guard Teresa Weatherspoon, who played on the two Liberty teams that were runners-up in the Women's National Basketball Association playoffs. ''Then when they had their runs and the crowd was deafening, we kept our composure. That's key to a championship team.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the Liberty returned to New York and at practice wore new T-shirts that bore the slogan ''Unfinished business'' and pictured the league trophy. Washington, playing in its first playoffs, has little time to learn.</p>
        <p>The Liberty is one victory away from advancing to the Eastern Conference finals, holding three major advantages going into tonight's Game 2: the experience, the lead and the home court of Madison Square Garden, where the Liberty has won its last 10 games, a place every bit as bone-rattling as Washington's arena.</p>
        <p>''This team loves to play at home,'' the shooting guard Becky Hammon said. ''As much fun as it is to go in and be the spoiler on someone else's home court, we want to defend our home court.''</p>
        <p>Heading home after Saturday night's remarkable victory, in which the Liberty built an 18-point lead in the first half, fell behind by 2 with four minutes left, then shut down the Mystics' momentum with a zone press, the Liberty sensed that a sweep was so close.</p>
        <p>''That's what I'm going for,'' said forward Tari Phillips, who along with Vickie Johnson led the Liberty with 20 points in the victory. ''I would rather sweep than have a third game. I think we're capable of doing that.''</p>
        <p>Just when the Liberty players seemed to be shuffling back to New York down by 1-0 to the only playoff team with a losing regular-season record, they regained their calm. ''Being veterans, they just capitalized on our mistakes,'' said Washington's Chamique Holdsclaw, who had two key turnovers during the Liberty's final run.</p>
        <p>Phillips said: ''The last three minutes were the most intense three minutes that we had probably the whole year. It was do or die, we were either going to shut them down, and score and get a comfortable lead or . . .''</p>
        <p>There was no other option. ''With the kind of pressure the Mystics put on you, it's easy to see how you can buckle,'' Liberty Coach Richie Adubato said. ''Whenever there is a comeback like that, there is always a chance you can lose the game, but it didn't happen, not with Vickie Johnson, Weatherspoon, Becky Hammon, and Tari Phillips. And Tamika Whitmore made a nice shot at the end. They wouldn't give up.''</p>
        <p>Johnson and Weatherspoon have played together in all three postseasons (Weatherspoon has not missed a game since the W.N.B.A. began in 1997), along with the key reserve Sue Wicks. Hammon and Whitmore joined the team last year. And while Phillips is a newcomer -- this morning she will receive the league's most improved player award -- she is also a 30-year-old professional who won an Italian league championship this spring.</p>
        <p>While the Liberty has jelled by now, having won 14 of its last 17 games, the Mystics are still improving in the trapping and pressing style implemented by the interim coach Darrell Walker, the Knicks' first-round draft pick in 1983. Only forward Vicky Bullett, who led all scorers with 22 points Saturday, has been in the W.N.B.A. playoffs before, and that was obvious in Game 1.</p>
        <p>''Our team has not been through the wars; New York has,'' Walker said. ''This is a young team, sometimes we have a tendency to panic.''</p>
        <p>Walker promised to press and trap the entire game tonight to offset the Liberty's intensity and the home crowd. But the Mystics also come to the Garden fueled by short-term memory. They won the last game they played here in the regular season, on a last-second jump shot from Holdsclaw.</p>
        <p>''It's always a good thing to come home, but in the back of your mind, you know how good this team is,'' Weatherspoon said about Washington. ''It's great that we got a win, but we haven't done anything yet. We have to play an even better game.''</p>
