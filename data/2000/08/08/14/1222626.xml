        <p>Pat Day shot License Fee out of the gate and never looked back in winning the Grade III Ballston Spa Breeders' Cup Handicap over a mile and a sixteenth on soft turf yesterday at Saratoga. License Fee, a 5-year-old mare, earned $125,700 for Winstar Farm and paid $8.40 for a $2 bet to win.</p>
        <p>Eugene and Laura Melnyk paid $1.65 million in February for a 2-year-old filly out of Hennessy, but Harmony Lodge looked like a bargain yesterday when rolling home a winner in a 5-furlong maiden race in 1:03.54. That tied a track record set by Tea Olive in 1946.</p>
        <p>JOE DRAPE</p>
        <p>ONLY 16 IN A ROW: Hallowed Dreams came up short in a bid to become the first horse to win 17 straight races, finishing third in the seventh race at Evangeline Downs in Carencro, La., on Saturday night.</p>
        <p>The 3-year-old filly, owned by Johnny Gaspard and Lloyd Romero, lost to Sparkles of Luck by two lengths. The record of 16 is also held by Cigar, Citation and Mister Frisky.</p>
