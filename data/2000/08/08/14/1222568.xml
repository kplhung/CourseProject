        <p>In Philadelphia, you got cheese-steak sandwiches and Rick Schroder. In Los Angeles, you get miniature Spago pizzas topped with turkey sausage, and Whoopi and Anjelica and Goldie. And you also have the president, who put in appearances over the weekend at fund-raising events that would benefit him and his wife.</p>
        <p>Los Angeles thrust a panoply of celebrities into the spotlight during the weekend as the celebrations to usher in the four-day Democratic National Convention began in earnest.</p>
        <p>Democrats could rely on celebrity wattage to draw publicity, something that the Republicans could not do in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>After all, Mr. Schroder, who drew stares and autograph-seekers in Philadelphia, is just another low-ranking civilian in this celebrity-saturated city. But the president still turns heads.</p>
        <p>From Stan Lee's estate in Malibu, where Cher and Michael Douglas mingled with Dorothy Rodham and John Travolta at a fund-raiser for Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate campaign, to the infamous grotto at the Playboy Mansion, where a curious Bryant Gumbel inspected the stagnant water, the tenor of the dinner parties, the soirees, the luncheons and brunches, the meeting and greeting and air-kissing underscored the many differences between the Democratic and Republican conventions.</p>
        <p>For example, it is unlikely that the fashion photographer Herb Ritts would have given a costume party -- one guest was dressed as the Marquis de Sade -- during the Philadelphia convention, as he did here on Saturday night.</p>
        <p>Nor did the Republicans have the eight Paskowitz brothers -- a dynasty of celebrated California surfers -- giving lessons to delegates and staff members from CNN and MTV. This happened on Saturday afternoon at a surf party on the beach in Santa Monica given by the Democratic National Committee.</p>
        <p>During the lessons, Terry McAuliffe, the chairman of the Democratic National Convention Committee, stood planted on the beach as a young woman sunbathed topless 20 feet away. Mr. McAuliffe, who played three holes of golf with President Clinton early on Saturday morning at a public course, surveyed the scene and pronounced his admittedly premature verdict on the coming week.</p>
        <p>Mr. McAuliffe looked out at the rolling waves as Joshua Paskowitz, a leopard-print tattoo snaking up his right arm and the word Freedom tattooed on his back, taught Mr. McAuliffe's nephew Matthew how to negotiate the rolling white water.</p>
        <p>Mr. McAuliffe, squinting his eyes while looking into the sun, said, ''This will be the best and the most important convention ever.''</p>
        <p>Izzy Paskowitz put his arm around Mr. McAuliffe and asked if he and his seven brothers could come hear Vice President Al Gore give his speech on Thursday night at the Staples Center. After all, ''We're the surfing Jews for Lieberman,'' he said with a broad smile.</p>
        <p>''I ought to put you guys in a commercial,'' Mr. McAuliffe said, and promised seats for all eight brothers.</p>
        <p>The president and the celebrities, from Milton Berle to Goldie Hawn, emerged in full force on Saturday evening at a celebration not affiliated with the convention when Mr. Lee, the founder of Stan Lee Media and the creator of Spider-Man, gave a fund-raiser for Mrs. Clinton's Senate campaign. Guests, who donated up to $25,000 a couple, ate lobster nage and chinois beef and sat through a rotisserie of dinner speakers that included Whoopi Goldberg and Ted Danson, and watched performances by Stevie Wonder, Cher and Patti LaBelle, among others.</p>
        <p>Introducing her song ''If I Could Turn Back Time,'' Cher told the audience that she wished she could turn back time: to a round of jovial booing from the audience, she admitted that she had not voted for Mr. Clinton in the last election. One guest said the celebration, despite the abundance of celebrities, had been subdued.</p>
        <p>''They were not getting jiggy with it, if that's what you mean,'' said the guest, who requested anonymity. ''These are people used to seeing each other all the time, and seeing a lineup of speakers and performers like this is something that happens often enough that they would not be that impressed.''</p>
        <p>The mood was also subdued at the Playboy Mansion, where Hugh Hefner and his daughter, Christie Hefner, the chief executive of Playboy Enterprises, gave a party in honor of ''America 2000,'' the convention theme. Both spoke openly about their anger and frustration with the Democratic National Committee, which had pressured Representative Loretta Sanchez to move a fund-raiser from the building to a site not so openly associated with sex and silicone, Universal Studios.</p>
        <p>''I think it is a travesty,'' Mr. Hefner said, surrounded by a half-dozen women in bunny costumes. During the party, which ended at 1 a.m., Mr. Hefner's guests, who were not allowed inside the building, fed grapes to the caged monkeys that he keeps on the property. Several others stooped their way into the grotto, a man-made cave (featuring Jacuzzi-size ponds of warm and heavily chlorinated water) that Mr. Hefner has said is specifically not intended for spelunking.</p>
        <p>The ill-fated Playboy-Sanchez party was not the only one to ruffle feathers. The president also appeared at the estate of Barbra Streisand yesterday morning for a brunch that would raise close to $10 million for the presidential library in Little Rock, Ark.</p>
        <p>Yesterday morning, in an interview on CNN, the House minority whip, Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, questioned whether it was prudent for the president to schedule such an event before Mr. Gore is to take the stage.</p>
        <p>''The timing on this probably isn't the best in the world,'' he said.</p>
        <p>By Sunday afternoon, the reception schedule had doubled in size from the day before. Mary Matalin and Shawn Steel, the vice chairman of the California Republican Party, gave a party for gay Republicans. Bianca Jagger was to appear at a party given by the producer Norman Lear for People for the American Way at the Beverly Hilton Hotel. The host of ''Politically Incorrect,'' Bill Maher, was scheduled to hold a cocktail party at Eurochow, a Westwood restaurant, for Handgun Control.</p>
        <p>Aaron Sorkin, the creator of NBC's ''The West Wing,'' and Warner Brothers, which produces the show, gave an elaborate party that was attended by the show's cast and dozens of Washington journalists, television newscasters and commentators.</p>
        <p>Chelsea Clinton was also there, spending much of the party sequestered in the facsimile of the Oval Office.</p>
        <p>But even though President Josiah Bartlet and most of his liberal Democratic staff on ''The West Wing'' are strong advocates of freedom of the press and the First Amendment, life in this case did not imitate TV.</p>
        <p>Journalists were ordered by Warner Brothers staff members to put away notebooks and tape recorders and not to take notes. No reason was given, but one executive said, ''It's not that kind of party.''</p>
        <p>THE DEMOCRATS: THE GATHERINGS  Correction:  August 24, 2000, Thursday  An article on Aug. 14 about celebrities who attended parties for the Democratic National Convention misstated the location of a fund-raiser given by Stan Lee, the creator of Spider-Man. It was at the home of Ken Roberts, a radio and real estate investor, in the Brentwood section of Los Angeles, not at Mr. Lee's home in Malibu.</p>
        <p>The article also listed two guests erroneously. While invited, Stevie Wonder and Michael Douglas did not attend.</p>
