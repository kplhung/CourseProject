        <p>As Latin Americans invent their own kind of rock, they eagerly recycle music from afar, happy to mix and mismatch. Sometimes they turn pop discards into trophies. Three South American bands -- La Ley from Chile, Los Amigos Invisibles from Venezuela and Illya Kuryaki and the Valderramas, from Argentina -- performed at Central Park Summerstage on Saturday afternoon, latching on to 1970's and 80's styles with respect and mockery. The concert was the lead-in to the first Latin Alternative Music Conference, a music-business convention in New York City through tomorrow.</p>
        <p>La Ley, which topped the bill and ended up playing through a downpour, was a Spanish-speaking echo of the 1980's, particularly of British and Irish bands that took themselves extremely seriously. La Ley's songs addressed grand subjects: faith, love, destiny, the meaning of life. In ''Eternidad,'' which opened La Ley's set, Beto Cuevas sang, ''I'm nearing the end of an existential highway.''</p>

        <p>As Latin Americans invent their own kind of rock, they eagerly recycle music from afar, happy to mix and mismatch. Sometimes they turn pop discards into trophies. Three South American bands -- La Ley from Chile, Los Amigos Invisibles from Venezuela and Illya Kuryaki and the Valderramas, from Argentina -- performed at Central Park Summerstage on Saturday afternoon, latching on to 1970's and 80's styles with respect and mockery. The concert was the lead-in to the first Latin Alternative Music Conference, a music-business convention in New York City through tomorrow.</p>
        <p>La Ley, which topped the bill and ended up playing through a downpour, was a Spanish-speaking echo of the 1980's, particularly of British and Irish bands that took themselves extremely seriously. La Ley's songs addressed grand subjects: faith, love, destiny, the meaning of life. In ''Eternidad,'' which opened La Ley's set, Beto Cuevas sang, ''I'm nearing the end of an existential highway.''</p>
        <p>The music approached its high-minded messages with sounds that ruled MTV in the mid-80's. In rock marches that had the triumphal tone of Simple Minds' songs, Pedro Frugone used plenty of U2's echoing guitar effects, while Mr. Cuevas emoted with the melodrama of Dave Gahan of Depeche Mode.</p>
        <p>Brief touches of surf guitar and funk hinted that La Ley, which has been performing since the early 90's, was once less pompous. But for the most part the band presented the least encouraging side of rock en espanol: a direct Spanish translation of an imported style.</p>
        <p>Los Amigos Invisibles had a simpler imperative: to get people dancing. Their core sound is the smooth mid-70's funk that returned in the 90's as so-called acid jazz, and their songs are built around the scrubbing, syncopated rhythm-guitar chords of Jose Luis Pardo, Los Amigos' main songwriter. But Los Amigos also toyed with other styles: merengue, boogaloo, hip-hop, even a techno bassline spattered with conga drumming. Julio Briceno sang more or less sardonic come-ons, making romantic promises while sometimes grabbing his crotch. Listeners could enjoy the ironies, or ignore them and keep on dancing; Los Amigos have done their funk homework.</p>
        <p>Illya Kuryaki and the Valderramas also love 1970's funk. Their current album, ''Leche'' (Universal), has a guest appearance by Bootsy Collins of Parliament-Funkadelic, and onstage the band also performed a song modeled on P-Funk's 70's rivals, Earth Wind and Fire.</p>
        <p>But funk is only one of the styles tossed into the band's songs. Illya Kuryaki's music is a wild patchwork, ricocheting from hip-hop to rock to funk to salsa to a Spanish-language revamp of Queen's ''Another One Bites the Dust,'' easily jumping from suavity to noise. And the lyrics, rapped and sung by Emmanuel Horvilleur and Dante Spinetta Zalazar, add a layer of surreal poetry, full of rebelliousness, death and raunchy transfiguration; in ''Jennifer del Estero,'' Jennifer Lopez leaves her derriere in the singer's freezer. Illya Kuryaki is a promising sign that rock en espanol plans to respect no boundaries.</p>
