        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Erudite and Groovy,'' by James Atlas (Op-Ed, Aug. 7):</p>
        <p>Mr. Atlas confuses the life of the mind with academic fashion. If Al Gore gained a love of inquiry and thought as a college student and has kept that alive, that in itself is a virtue and points to a proper and dynamic relationship between intellect and power.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Gore is an intellectual, he follows in the footsteps of John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, two of our founding fathers who embraced close reading and systematic thought as lifelong enterprises. They drew on books and ideas that they encountered when they were young men of college age. And perhaps they were worried, as Mr. Atlas suspects Mr. Gore is, that modern civilization might indeed overemphasize the material at the expense of the spiritual.</p>
        <p>LEON BOTSTEIN  President, Bard College  Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y.  Aug. 9, 2000</p>
