        <p>As the presidential nominees of the two Reform Parties left Splitsville this week to campaign across the rest of the country by bus, their associates began plotting legal strategies to seize the $12.6 million in federal campaign money that is awaiting the real party's true nominee -- as soon as a court decides what and who they are.</p>
        <p>The nominees' departures ended an intense week of bickering here that left the Reform Party with two of everything, including nominees claiming to be its presidential candidate: Patrick J. Buchanan and John Hagelin.</p>
        <p>The war, however, continues. It is not only before the campaign money dispensers at the Federal Election Commission, and later the courts, that the two sides have to argue their case. In as many as half the states, the Reform Party is listed on the presidential ballot by party, which means each side has to convince individual state election commissions that its candidate is the legitimate one.</p>
        <p>''There is so much more to play out,'' said Russell J. Verney, a leading party official who aligned himself with Mr. Hagelin after the split. ''As much chaos as we've had nationally, now we're going to have it at the state level.''</p>
        <p>But if the primary vote that both sides threw out as fraudulent was any indication of support, it hardly matters what Mr. Buchanan or Mr. Hagelin does, where they go or what they say.</p>
        <p>Together, the two men energized all of 78,000 Americans to cast a vote during a monthlong balloting period, a sign that as the presidential election approaches, voters are not so uncomfortable with the Republican and Democratic choices that they feel a need for someone else altogether.</p>
        <p>In a political version of ''To Tell the Truth,'' lawyers for each side are facing the rather daunting prospect of trying to make sense of the last five days here.</p>
        <p>Not that either side views any of this as any life-or-death struggle. Both candidates have vowed to press ahead through November, no matter what happens in any legal or administrative arena. If so, one side would likely have to assume a new party name or affiliation.</p>
        <p>In that context, each candidate still has an advantage. As a self-described red-meat conservative and a fixture in American politics for almost three decades, Mr. Buchanan has achieved something of cult status as an ideologue who pushes all the right isolationist, xenophobic and homophobic buttons for his new band of supporters.</p>
        <p>In his acceptance speech on Saturday night he drew wild applause railing against the United Nations, imported chopsticks, United States Representative Barney Frank, and even ''money changers'' whom he said the party had to ''drive out of the temples of our civilization.''</p>
        <p>And the more that the major party candidates, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, fight for the political center, the more appeal Mr. Buchanan has to hard-right conservatives left behind.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hagelin's edge may be that as a longtime leader of the Natural Law Party, he has something of a reputation among fringe parties. Aides said he would like to create a broad coalition of third parties.</p>
        <p>''We will continue,'' Mr. Hagelin said in his acceptance speech on Saturday. ''Under what banner, I don't know.''</p>
        <p>Both candidates have enough money on hand for modest campaign efforts, their aides said.</p>
        <p>Bay Buchanan, chief strategist for her brother, said he has enough money now, between $1 million and $2 million, and expects to raise enough through donations to keep him on the road four or five days a week from Labor Day through the election.</p>
        <p>''We can run the whole campaign on what we have now, but without any media,'' she said, referring to radio and television commercials.</p>
        <p>Bob Roth, a spokesman for Mr. Hagelin, said he could do the same, with the $2 million the Hagelin campaign currently has.</p>
