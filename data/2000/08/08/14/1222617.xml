        <p>New York Times/CBS News Poll finds most of 4,339 delegates at Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles think of themselves as moderates, but that their views on variety of major issues are more liberal than those of public, or even Democratic voters generally; finds ideological distance between Democratic delegates and rank and file is similar to gap displayed at recent Republican convention, where delegates were strikingly more conservative than ordinary Republicans or ordinary Americans; poll's findings detailed; photo (M)</p>

        <p>The Democratic delegates arriving here to nominate Vice President Al Gore for president think of themselves as moderates, but their views on issues from affirmative action to an activist federal government are more liberal than those of the public or even Democratic voters generally, a New York Times/CBS News Poll shows.</p>
        <p>On one issue, the death penalty, a random sample of 1,042 of the 4,339 delegates was decisively more liberal than Mr. Gore, though 56 percent said they were moderates.

        <p>The Democratic delegates arriving here to nominate Vice President Al Gore for president think of themselves as moderates, but their views on issues from affirmative action to an activist federal government are more liberal than those of the public or even Democratic voters generally, a New York Times/CBS News Poll shows.</p>
        <p>On one issue, the death penalty, a random sample of 1,042 of the 4,339 delegates was decisively more liberal than Mr. Gore, though 56 percent said they were moderates. Asked to choose between the death penalty and life in prison without parole, 20 percent of the delegates preferred executions, compared with 46 percent of Democrats generally and 51 percent of the public. Mr. Gore is one of those supporters.</p>
        <p>Kenneth R. Moore, a 72-year-old delegate from Sun Lakes, Ariz., explained that attitude. He said: ''I've gone 180 degrees on the death penalty. I used to favor it. But with the questionable executions recently, particularly with the mentally retarded, I just can't support the death penalty without standards that require absolute proof and an adequate defense. Without that, there is no justice.''</p>
        <p>The ideological distance between the Democratic delegates and their rank and file was similar to the gap displayed two weeks ago in Philadelphia, where Republican delegates were strikingly more conservative than ordinary Republicans or ordinary Americans. Such gaps have also been found at past conventions.</p>
        <p>Most of the interviews of the delegates were conducted in July, before the selection of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut as Mr. Gore's running mate and Dick Cheney as the vice-presidential choice by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican nominee for president.</p>
        <p>The death penalty is an example of Democratic delegates' being distant from public attitudes. Occasionally, though, they were closer than Republicans were. For example, 63 percent of Democratic delegates and 64 percent of the American public agreed with the statement that ''We must protect the environment even if it means jobs in your community are lost because of it.'' Only 32 percent of Republican delegates agreed.</p>
        <p>Donna I. King, a delegate from Norwalk, Conn., explained her view today, saying: ''Now is the right time to focus on the environment. The economy is strong, unemployment is low. Address this issue in the best of times, and focus on inspection, regulation and enforcement.''</p>
        <p>One distinct difference between the Democratic and Republican delegates was their confidence about the election. Only 51 percent of the Democrats said Mr. Gore was the favorite in their state, and just 27 percent called him a big favorite.</p>
        <p>Among Republicans, 68 percent said Governor Bush was a favorite in their state and 44 percent said he had a big edge.</p>
        <p>The Democratic poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points; the margin for the Republican survey was plus or minus two percentage points.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman's selection plainly made some Democratic delegates more hopeful.</p>
        <p>Rosemary Trump, a labor organizer from Murrysville, Pa., who had called the Pennsylvania race a ''tossup,'' said the Lieberman choice ''will have a big impact.''</p>
        <p>''It's going to be a close election here in Pennsylvania, but this will energize those of us who feel empowered by this choice to work even harder,'' Ms. Trump said.</p>
        <p>Stephen W. Long, a lawyer from Crestwood, Ky., had called his state a tossup as well. He said: ''Lieberman being a moderate helps him here in Kentucky. I don't think the Jewish factor will be a problem at all here. His stances on taxes and education exemplify what Gore has been standing for and also strengthen Gore's personality as a straight shooter.''</p>
        <p>The surveys also showed major differences of sex, race and income in the two groups of delegates. Forty-eight percent of the Democrats are women, compared with 35 percent of the Republicans. Nineteen percent of the Democratic delegates, like 19 percent of Democratic voters, are African-American; 4 percent of Republican delegates are African-American, and 2 percent of Republican voters are.</p>
        <p>While only 19 percent of all voters said their family incomes exceeded $75,000 last year, 57 percent of both Democratic and Republican delegates did. And 17 percent of Republican delegates, compared with 6 percent of Democrats, would not answer the question. Almost twice as many Republicans, 23 percent to 12 percent for Democrats, called themselves millionaires.</p>
        <p>Thirty-one percent of Democratic delegates said they belonged to a labor union; only 4 percent of Republicans did. The median age of Democratic delegates was 51; for Republicans it was 53.</p>
        <p>There was one major similarity on issues. Sixty-four percent of the public, with insignificant differences between Republicans and Democrats, said they thought the large, unregulated gifts to political parties from companies, unions and rich people, known as soft money, should be banned. Neither set of delegates was in step with that attitude. Republican delegates wanted them permitted, by 65 percent to 24 percent; Democratic delegates were split, with 44 percent wanting them allowed and 47 percent calling for a ban.</p>
        <p>But more often one party or the other proved out of step with its own voters or the public. Among Democratic delegates, 83 percent said they favored affirmative action, compared with 51 percent of the public generally and 29 percent of Republican delegates. Deborah Goldberg, a Democratic delegate from Farmington, Mich., explained, ''As long as there is discrimination, there should be affirmative action.''</p>
        <p>Democratic delegates strongly opposed tuition vouchers for private or religious schools, by 86 percent to 10 percent. Democrats in general were opposed, too, but only by 54 percent to 41 percent, and the public was about evenly split, with 47 percent in favor and 46 percent against. But Republican delegates, who favored vouchers by 71 percent to 20 percent, were almost as far out of step with the public uncertainty.</p>
        <p>Democratic delegates were much closer to public attitudes than Republican delegates on questions of increasing safety and environmental regulation of business and requiring trigger locks on handguns. But while 73 percent of Democratic delegates said the government should do more to solve national problems, only 33 percent of the public did.</p>
        <p>About the Survey</p>
        <p>The New York Times/CBS News survey of delegates to the Democratic National Convention was conducted from July 6 to Aug. 10, mainly by telephone but also by fax, mail, e-mail message or Internet if individual delegates preferred.</p>
        <p>Out of 4,339 Democratic delegates, 1,464 were randomly sampled with 1,042 completing the questionnaire by the end of polling.</p>
        <p>A parallel Times/CBS News survey of delegates to the Republican National Convention was conducted from June 26 to July 28. Out of 2,066 Republican delegates, 1,551 were randomly sampled with 1,055 completing the questionnaire by the end of polling.</p>
        <p>The results of each survey have been weighted to account for state delegation size, gender and the number of delegates pledged to each presidential candidate. In addition, the survey of Democrats was weighted by type of delegate.</p>
        <p>In theory, in 19 out of 20 cases, the results based on such samples will differ by no more than plus or minus three percentage points for Democratic delegates, and plus or minus two percentage points for Republican delegates, from what would have been obtained by surveying all delegates to each convention.</p>
        <p>The practical difficulties of conducting any survey may also introduce other sources of error. For instance, delegates varied in how difficult they were to reach. Also variations in question wording or the order of questions can lead to somewhat different results.</p>
        <p>Results for voters are from nationwide Times/CBS News polls of the public taken during July.</p>
