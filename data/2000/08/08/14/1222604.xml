        <p>The 20,000 people of Jefferson Township in north-central New Jersey came out into the gray windy air yesterday, shaking their heads in disbelief. Saturday's diabolical thunderstorm -- the one that wouldn't go away -- had finally departed, having dropped 14 inches of rain on their lovely, lake-dotted little domain.</p>
        <p>It is a place where hardly anything ever happens, folks say. But yesterday, it seemed, the town had been pixilated: 300 homes flooded, several bridges and roads washed out, driveways running like millraces, trees down, cars and boats drowned, two dams gone -- and the small lakes the dams had held back vanished, too, drained into mud flats littered with dead fish.</p>
        <p>Some power and phones were still out, and water pumps were chugging away in basements and garages in Jefferson, nearby Sparta and other parts of northern New Jersey. The Musconetcong River was still cresting, and dozens of residents of Sparta and Hackettstown were evacuated as a precaution.</p>
        <p>But water was receding in most of the flooded areas yesterday, and officials and residents of Jefferson and in surrounding Morris, Sussex, Passaic, Bergen, Warren, Essex and Hunterdon Counties were counting their blessings as well as their losses as they began the soggy cleanup.</p>
        <p>No one had been killed or injured, and while damage may run into hundreds of millions of dollars -- the estimate was $7 million in Jefferson Township alone -- many town residents were more astounded than stricken by the perfect deluge that had hit their middle-class, semirural community 40 miles west of New York.</p>
        <p>''I've seen the water high, but never anything like this,'' said Linda Silbert, a 25-year resident of Jefferson Township, 42 square miles of scenic wooded hills and winding roads in Morris County north of Lake Hopatcong. ''Everyone I've seen around town is just in awe.''</p>
        <p>Properly so, said Fred Gadomski, a meteorologist with Pennsylvania State University, who noted that the thunderstorm that struck New Jersey on Saturday was phenomenal. Most thunderstorms dump vast amounts of rain for a few minutes and pass on. But this one stood dead still much of the day, dumping rain on a narrow corridor of northern New Jersey hour after hour after hour.</p>
        <p>''For the people in Sparta and Jefferson Township,'' Mr. Gadomski said, ''that would have been a once-in-a-lifetime rain.''</p>
        <p>Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and other officials flew over the flooded areas yesterday to assess the damage and pledged aid. A spokesman for the governor, Peter McDonough, said officials would have a preliminary damage estimate today.</p>
        <p>In Sussex County, Phil Morlock, the health and public safety administrator, told The Associated Press that the storm had caused $166 million in damage there, half of it to bridges and roads and the rest to private property. In Newton, he said, water mains were destroyed.</p>
        <p>In Sparta, where three roads and three bridges were washed out by the torrential rains, residents of several homes in the path of a potential mudslide were evacuated yesterday. About 30 families spent Saturday night in an emergency shelter in Sparta.</p>
        <p>In Jefferson, up to 300 homes were hit by flooding, most of them on the rims of a half-dozen small lakes that swelled and spilled onto surrounding properties, said the township spokesman, Eric F. Wilsusen. About 30 businesses also were hit by flooding, he said. About 80 residents stayed in shelters Saturday night, but all returned home or stayed with friends yesterday.</p>
        <p>Bill Graham, his wife and two children were in their Jefferson home on Lake Shawnee on Saturday when, he said, ''I heard a deafening noise, and the house started to tremble.'' The lake and two brooks flanking his house had risen up and engulfed his property.</p>
        <p>He and his family were rescued by police boat. When they returned, they found that the waters had dug a moat around their house, destroyed their car and washed away their sailboat, paddleboat and rowboat, and a gardening shed full of equipment. They found the shed 75 feet away, but ''I don't know where my boats are,'' Mr. Graham said. ''Probably at the bottom of the lake.''</p>
        <p>The force of the rain burst dams on Seneca and Tomahawk Lakes, both of which drained into mud flats. Residents of lakefront homes yesterday looked out on ugly basins rimmed with toppling docks and strewn with dead fish and overturned boats.</p>
        <p>A mudslide on Saturday descended across Route 15, a major divided highway in Sussex County, closing lanes in both directions. But transportation officials said the northbound lanes were reopened yesterday and the southbound lanes were expected to be open by this morning.</p>
        <p>By midafternoon yesterday, power had been restored to all but about 250 of the 10,000 homes that had been blacked out in northern New Jersey on Saturday, officials of GPU Energy said. About 50 homes in Jefferson were still without power, town officials said. Phone repairs were also under way, but there was no estimate of the number of homes and businesses without service.</p>
        <p>The storm damage was often whimsical, depending on the lay of the land or the porousness of walls.</p>
        <p>''My basement had only six inches of water, but my neighbor's had six feet,'' said Patti Glennon, 44, of Jefferson.</p>
        <p>And Roy Creatura, 63, said his house had ''a river going through it.'' He explained, ''The water was coming in the front door and sweeping out the back.''</p>
