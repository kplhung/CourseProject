        <p>Judging by polls and media reaction, Al Gore engaged the public's interest before the Democratic Convention with his choice of Joseph Lieberman at least as well as George Bush did before the Republican event by choosing Dick Cheney.

        <p>Judging by polls and media reaction, Al Gore engaged the public's interest before the Democratic Convention with his choice of Joseph Lieberman at least as well as George Bush did before the Republican event by choosing Dick Cheney. But Mr. Gore has to take a very different tack this week in Los Angeles than the Republicans did in Philadelphia. If the objective of the G.O.P. was to soften differences between the parties, Mr. Gore's goal has to be to make the distinctions abundantly clear.</p>
        <p>Here the job is principally his. The otherwise smart choice of running mate not only won't help, but may make the task more difficult, since Mr. Lieberman's record includes often considering compromises with the G.O.P. on tax cuts, privatization of Social Security and other issues.</p>
        <p>Governor Bush made a strong personal showing in Philadelphia -- one that Vice President Gore will struggle to match. It's unlikely that Mr. Gore will overtake his opponent on voter perceptions of charm, leadership ability or even the much hoped-for but never observed stature gap. And since his early stumbles, Mr. Bush has not looked like a candidate who will fall on his face at a critical juncture.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore must gently but clearly counter the notion that Mr. Bush and his party are more compassionate and inclusive than Republicans past. And he has to make voters feel there is something at stake in the election. A surprisingly large number don't think who's elected president matters.</p>
        <p>For many Americans, the first year of the campaign served to blur, rather than accentuate, issue differences. A Pew Research Center survey in June found a bare 51 percent majority of voters thinking Bush and Gore took different positions. The number saying their stands were similar had actually increased from 24 percent to 33 percent since last summer.</p>
        <p>Little wonder we also found as many as 32 percent saying either candidate could do a good job and about the same percentage saying it did not matter who was elected. (In 1992, by contrast, only 18 percent saw the presidential choice as unimportant.)</p>
        <p>This is bad news for Al Gore, because when specific issue questions are raised, he and his party score significantly higher than Mr. Bush and the G.O.P. The public has expressed more confidence in the Democrats than Republicans on health care, entitlements, education, the environment and gun control. And most candidate image polls until recently also found Mr. Gore holding the edge on these issues, except for gun control.</p>
        <p>But so far this issue advantage has not sunk in. Just before the G.O.P. convention, 53 percent of respondents told Newsweek pollsters Mr. Bush shared their views on top issues, while 43 percent said that about Mr. Gore. After the convention, a follow-up Newsweek poll found Mr. Bush had made progress on some specific issues, like education, as well.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Gore wants to move ahead, he has to drill home his differences with Mr. Bush on Social Security reform, health maintenance organizations, the environment, gun control and education. But there could be pitfalls. He can't let himself be seen as trying to scare the public about risks of privatizing Social Security or introducing school vouchers or tax cuts, but rather as pointing out how the trade-offs come home to average voters. And he must avoid seeming mean-spirited. (The Republicans did a brilliant job of finding the right tone with the general message ''It's not that President Clinton is a bad man -- he robbed you of an opportunity.'')</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman, who has often worked across party lines, may be little help to Mr. Gore in starkly defining the Democratic position. But Mr. Gore also can't seem to be moving too far to the left, and in that regard the choice of the centrist Mr. Lieberman may be helpful.</p>
