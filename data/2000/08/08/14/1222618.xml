        <p>Roger Clemens came to the big leagues as a power pitcher, and after agreeing to a contract that will endure beyond his 40th birthday, Clemens said he intended to finish his career as a power pitcher. When he cannot throw hard, he will not throw at all.</p>
        <p>And Clemens still throws very hard. The best working definition of a power pitcher -- radar guns not required -- might be how opposing hitters respond in late-afternoon shadows. The Anaheim Angels reacted as if they heard Clemens's fastball better than they saw it in tonight's twilight. Clemens scattered four hits over six and two-thirds innings and helped shut down the Angels, 4-1, salvaging the last game of the three-game series for the Yankees (63-50). They will begin a three-game series in Texas on Monday.</p>
        <p>Clemens (10-6) is expected to sign his contract extension this week; he is obligated to play two years for the Yankees and the Yankees are obligated to pay him $30.9 million for the 2001 and 2002 seasons, an average of $15.45 million a year -- the highest in baseball history. It will be the fourth time in Clemens's career that he will hold the distinction of earning the highest annual average salary of any pitcher.</p>
        <p>He has 257 career victories and 3,446 career strikeouts. He struck out only two tonight, but he was overpowering; he made no effort to conceal his aggressive approach in the early innings of this game, which started at 5 p.m., Pacific time.</p>
        <p>The sun sets behind the stands on the third-base side here, and when the game started, the shadows cloaked the 60 feet 6 inches between home plate and the  mound. The lights of Edison Field were turned on, but they had no effect until the middle innings. These are almost the worst possible conditions for hitting because the background is in sunlight and the face of the ball is blackened, like a lunar eclipse. ''You cannot see the spin on the ball,'' Scott Brosius said. ''You just look for the dot and swing,'' David Justice said.</p>
        <p>Clemens seized the opportunity. He threw 14 pitches in the first inning -- all fastballs ranging from 92 miles an hour to 95 m.p.h. -- and there was nothing but unsure swings from the Angels, who were flailing in the dark. ''He knew,'' said Mo Vaughn, the Anaheim slugger. ''He's a veteran.''</p>
        <p>Clemens started the second inning with a 92-m.p.h. fastball and needed only 10 pitches in the inning, mixing in a couple of split-fingered fastballs. Clemens said afterward that he had hoped to use his splitter more, but it was never really working and he stuck with the fastball.</p>
        <p>He was in a steady rhythm by the third inning, standing tall on the rubber, driving toward the plate, fastball after fastball, getting the ball back from catcher Jorge Posada and attacking again. Clemens whipped a 91-m.p.h. fastball over the outside corner to Kevin Stocker for a called third strike. Posada, possessed by Clemens's tempo, excitedly rose to his feet and fired to third to start the toss around the infield, and Brosius had to jump to spear the ball.</p>
        <p>Clemens threw 13 pitches in the third, all fastballs. ''That was the most explosive I've seen his fastball,'' said Darin Erstad, the Anaheim left fielder. ''He might've had the same speed'' in the past, ''but tonight he had a good downward movement.''</p>
        <p>The score was close and every pitch was pivotal as Clemens's energy drained out of him; by the fourth inning his velocity was down, and he mixed a changeup and slider with his fastball.</p>
        <p>Anaheim's Ramon Ortiz is a power pitcher, like Clemens, and the Yankees took many weak swings against him. So the Yankees offered passive resistance: they waited for Ortiz to throw strikes, which he could not do consistently. Bernie Williams walked to open the second, and Justice was hit by a pitch. Posada walked with two outs, loading the bases. Brosius fell behind, one ball and two strikes, and fouled off three straight pitches before drawing three straight pitches out of the strike zone for a run-scoring walk. After two innings, the Yankees had more runs (one) than hits (none).</p>
        <p>They added a run in the fourth in similar fashion. Justice poked a single through the right side with a no-ball, two-strike count, and Ortiz walked Martinez and Posada. Bases loaded, once more.</p>
        <p>After the third inning, Yankees Manager Joe Torre complained mildly to Eric Cooper, the first base umpire, that Ortiz was repeatedly moving the ball in his glove with runners on base and that it should be a balk. Now, with the bases loaded and the Yankees' bench still chirping about a balk, Ortiz leaned back slightly on the rubber, drew up his hands in front of his face -- and wiped his nose. Cooper jabbed a finger in Ortiz's direction, calling a balk that allowed Justice to score.</p>
        <p>Clemens carried a 2-1 lead into the bottom of the seventh, his pitch count nearing 100, and his effort had sapped his energy. After the pinch-hitter Tim Salmon singled, Torre replaced Clemens with Mike Stanton, who promptly picked off the pinch-runner Benji Gil to end the inning. Clemens was waiting for Stanton at the top step of the dugout, hand extended, his pitching line final: four hits, three walks and just one run. He has not been charged with a loss since June 9, the last time he allowed more than three runs.</p>
        <p>The Yankees added a couple of runs in the eighth, the rally set up when Justice somehow recovered after being fooled by a breaking ball and pulled a single to right field.</p>
        <p>Mariano Rivera retired all five batters he faced for the save, and the weary Clemens, marching toward 300 victories, sounded tired afterward. He knows he will wake up Monday, he said, and his body will suffer for his effort today, all in the life of a power pitcher.</p>
