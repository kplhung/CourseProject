        <p>New York State's education commissioner, Richard Mills, and New York City's schools chancellor, Harold Levy, have been wrangling for months over a new state regulation requiring the city to hire only certified teachers in low-performing schools beginning this fall. The commissioner is right to pressure New York City, given its habit of hobbling its poorest students with unqualified teachers and chaotic, dysfunctional schools.

        <p>New York State's education commissioner, Richard Mills, and New York City's schools chancellor, Harold Levy, have been wrangling for months over a new state regulation requiring the city to hire only certified teachers in low-performing schools beginning this fall. The commissioner is right to pressure New York City, given its habit of hobbling its poorest students with unqualified teachers and chaotic, dysfunctional schools. But given a statewide shortage that is making certified teachers difficult to come by, the city could easily fall just short of full compliance, no matter how hard it tries.</p>
        <p>Acting on research that has shown a direct correlation between teacher certification and student reading scores, the State Board of Regents has required that every teacher in the state be certified by 2003. The timetable requires districts to begin this process earlier with failing schools, where all newly hired teachers are to be certified by September of this year.</p>
        <p>The New York City Board of Education has expanded its recruitment effort and created an alternative certification program that will supply perhaps 200 certified, nontraditional applicants by this fall. Mr. Levy has also increased by $9,000 the starting salaries of certified teachers who come from outside the system and move into low-performing schools. In addition, newly certified teachers are being funneled into failing schools -- a measure that could inject new energy into those schools but could also backfire by filling some schools with green recruits.</p>
        <p>These measures are admirable. But the city could still fall short of the state mandate, despite a new overture from the teachers' union aimed at solving this problem. Angered by what he sees as recalcitrance, Mr. Mills has filed a lawsuit to bar the city from placing uncertified teachers in low-performing schools. The commissioner is right to keep up the pressure. But the suit will not conjure up talented teachers where too few exist.</p>
        <p>In addition, the heated rhetoric surrounding this suit has created a schism between two like-minded men who are the most important educational reformers in the state. For its part, the Board of Education needs to redouble its efforts to find certified teachers between now and the first day of school. But the state must also be flexible -- and ready with both money and recruiting strategies -- if the city does its best but still falls shy of its goal.</p>
