        <p>ON a muggy night in Philadelphia, Rick Kaplan sat in the CNN control booth in an advanced state of bliss. His floor correspondents were killing themselves to get good material. The Texas delegates, bowing their heads in prayer during a speech by a gay congressman, made for a nifty TV moment. And a marquee speech by Senator John McCain proved to be just this side of cryptic, excellent late-evening fodder for Jeff Greenfield and the other analysts on the skybox anchor desk.</p>
        <p>Facing a wall of 100 television screens, Mr. Kaplan, CNN's president of United States operations and producer of the convention coverage, could not contain his joy. ''There's so much news here!'' he exclaimed.</p>
        <p>It was the declaration of a man totally in his element, a representative of a news organization that was clear about its mission at the conventions: to be everywhere, to see everything, to throw the equivalent, in the words of another CNN executive, of ''a political cocktail party.''</p>
        <p>The shindigs may be going full blast at all-news cable networks like CNN, a unit of Time Warner; the Fox News Channel, a unit of the News Corporation; and C-Span. But on the broadcast network side of television, the parties are ever more modest affairs. In fact, turn on ABC, NBC and CBS this week and take a look at how they cover the Democratic convention, because you may never see the like on these networks again.</p>
        <p>All three are likely to continue to play a role, and the political parties are likely to continue to covet every moment on these highest of high-visibility networks. But the widespread expectation is that the scaling back in prime time that occurred this year will only intensify the next time, perhaps limiting the big three to broadcasting the acceptance speeches of the presidential and vice presidential nominees.</p>
        <p>''Prime time is a different landscape than it was a decade ago,'' said Al Ortiz, executive producer of the ''CBS Evening News.'' ''I can't imagine that four years from now that the networks are going to want to spend millions of dollars to come to these places and do the same thing. They said this four years ago, and yet it's a big story that we did cut back on a little bit, and I think that in four years, there will be a further reduction.''</p>
        <p>For years, there has been talk in political circles of reducing the four-day conventions by a day or two, but the networks seem poised to make the decision themselves. ''Under the current format it's Monday and Tuesday that are at risk clearly for both parties,'' said Paul Friedman, executive vice president of ABC News, referring to the initial two convention nights. Noting how meticulously the parties try to pack these evenings with stars, like Gen. Colin L. Powell and Senator McCain in Philadelphia and President Clinton in Los Angeles, he added, ''If we have two totally packaged events there will be less coverage.''</p>
        <p>If ABC, NBC and CBS once were cemented into similar styles of coverage of conventions, blocking out the same sections of prime time and relying on the same type of programming, the 2000 conventions are demonstrating the separate paths the three networks are taking. ABC News remains the most traditional, providing prime-time exposure on each of the four nights and following up on ''Nightline,'' while NBC has made the most radical departure, drastically reducing its coverage on the flagship broadcast network and making liberal use of its brand-name stars on MSNBC, the joint venture of Microsoft and NBC, which itself is a unit of General Electric.</p>
        <p>Andrew Lack, the president of NBC News, said the networks have merely been responding to changes in the nature of the conventions and the political process. ''The broadcasting platform serves more as a public service, when the nominee, say, makes that acceptance speech,'' he said. ''But we don't have much of an obligation to go through the party's celebration. On the cable platform, you have a different situation: the 24-hour format is geared toward covering the news of the day. And they cover the story, no matter what.''</p>
        <p>The networks, too, are relying ever more heavily on their Web operations. Mr. Lack said that MSNBC.com was recording about two million unique users a day during the Republican convention, ''a little bit of a bump'' over normal usage.</p>
        <p>The tension, though, between the commercial demands of prime time and the network's civic obligations was evident in Philadelphia. At CBS, the way that convention coverage was inserted on the first and second nights into the 10 p.m. editions of ''48 Hours'' and ''60 Minutes II'' was criticized  both inside and outside the organization. And top news personnel, from Andrew Heyward, the president of CBS News, to Jeff Zucker, executive producer of NBC's convention coverage, spoke publicly of their frustrations with the plastic in which the conventions are being wrapped.</p>
        <p>The grumbling, if anything, has created something of a divide in television news. Cable networks like CNN say they would be just as happy if the broadcast networks would scale back and just stop complaining about the lack of news at the conventions, a practice that Mr. Kaplan believes turns off viewers. Indeed, ratings were down for CNN and the broadcast networks over the 1996 Republican convention in San Diego.</p>
        <p>In an interview the morning after the McCain's speech, Mr. Kaplan said: ''I mean, tell me: it's a waste of time to cover a Republican convention, and it's not a waste of time to put on a failed rerun of a failed show?'' He was referring to NBC's decision  to show a rerun of its low-rated drama ''First Watch,'' consigning coverage of the first night of the Republican convention to its cable partner MSNBC.</p>
        <p>''Journalists ought not to be against covering news,'' he continued. ''They shouldn't be embarrassed about it. Instead, they're here to tear the story down.''</p>
        <p>Actually, news executives across the board say that despite the freeze-dried aspect of the proceedings, they were relieved that over all, the audience was not significantly lower for the Philadelphia gathering. They tended to view that as a vote of confidence. ''Not all of our stations carried it, but we got about 85 percent carriage,'' said Lester M. Crystal, executive producer of ''The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer,'' which produced PBS's coverage. ''There was a kind of validation in that, that it was a big story.''</p>
        <p>MEDIA  Correction:  August 16, 2000, Wednesday  An article in Business Day on Monday about the scaling back of network television coverage of the Republican and Democratic political conventions misstated the name of a series that NBC showed on the Republicans' first night. It was ''Third Watch,'' not ''First Watch.''</p>
