        <p>Kinkos.com, an online start-up, has announced a deal with the Kinko's chain of copy shops and FedEx to create a service that promises to deliver finished presentations and reports within a few hours of receiving the data.</p>
        <p>Online document delivery services, so far offered only by a small number of start-ups with names like Mimeo.com and NowDocs.com, have struck a chord with business travelers and others who want to transmit documents to printing shops for formatting, proofread them on screen and have them delivered throughout the country at designated times.</p>

        <p>Kinkos.com, an online start-up, has announced a deal with the Kinko's chain of copy shops and FedEx to create a service that promises to deliver finished presentations and reports within a few hours of receiving the data.</p>
        <p>Online document delivery services, so far offered only by a small number of start-ups with names like Mimeo.com and NowDocs.com, have struck a chord with business travelers and others who want to transmit documents to printing shops for formatting, proofread them on screen and have them delivered throughout the country at designated times.</p>
        <p>Kinkos.com was formed March 1 as a separate company from Kinko's Inc., the nation's largest chain of copy and document preparation stores. Its financial backers include Kinko's and America Online.</p>
        <p>The three-way deal, announced last week, will use the 1,000 Kinko's stores and FedEx's delivery network.</p>
        <p>''What customers need is 'time definite,' '' said Rick Steele, Kinkos.com's chief executive, meaning they want to know exactly when their documents will be delivered. With the new service, customers can have finished documents within four hours in 20 major markets; the companies plan to add 35 more by the end of the year.</p>
        <p>As part of the deal, the service, called Print to Kinko's, will be on both the FedEx and Kinkos.com Web sites. The deal with FedEx will allow the companies to scale the operation quickly as customer demand grows, said David Roussain, FedEx vice president for electronic commerce.</p>
        <p>FedEx already operates service centers in 50 Kinko's stores; it plans to increase that number to 150 in about nine months.</p>
