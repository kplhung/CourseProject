        <p>Four years ago, Neil Walker missed a spot on the United States Olympic swimming team by one-hundredth of a second, a margin so small that it inevitably produced disappointment that was huge and inconsolable.</p>
        <p>In the Olympic trials tonight, Walker churned out of the blocks at world-record pace in the 100-meter freestyle and, while he could not maintain the searing sprint, he did hold off Gary Hall Jr. to win in 48.71 seconds and finally qualify for an individual event at the Summer Games next month in Sydney, Australia.</p>

        <p>Four years ago, Neil Walker missed a spot on the United States Olympic swimming team by one-hundredth of a second, a margin so small that it inevitably produced disappointment that was huge and inconsolable.</p>
        <p>In the Olympic trials tonight, Walker churned out of the blocks at world-record pace in the 100-meter freestyle and, while he could not maintain the searing sprint, he did hold off Gary Hall Jr. to win in 48.71 seconds and finally qualify for an individual event at the Summer Games next month in Sydney, Australia.</p>
        <p>Second place in 48.84 seconds was no less of an accomplishment for Hall, the irreverent freestyler who won two gold medals and a pair of silvers at the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games but whose career has since been threatened by diabetes and interrupted by a positive drug test for marijuana. Tonight was only the fourth time Hall swam the 100 freestyle in serious competition in the past two years.</p>
        <p>By finishing fifth in 49.29 seconds, Anthony Ervin, 19, of Valencia, Calif., became a provisional qualifier for the 400-meter freestyle relay in Sydney and became the first African-American swimmer to make the Olympic team. Ervin attends the University of California and is the collegiate champion in the 100-meter freestyle.</p>
        <p>''It means a great deal,'' said Ervin, who has a white mother and a black father. ''I've always been proud of my heritage.''</p>
        <p>Walker, 24, who lives in Austin, Tex., knew tonight that he had likely already qualified for the Sydney Games by finishing second last Friday in the 100-meter backstroke. But that was a provisional qualification, given that the American swimmers are limited to an Olympic roster of 52. Tonight's victory ended any doubt.</p>
        <p>It was sweet redemption for Walker, who finished seventh in the 100-meter freestyle at the 1996 trials by one-hundredth of a second, thus missing the American relay team in Atlanta by the smallest possible margin.</p>
        <p>''It's hard to put disappointment like that into words,'' Walker said last week of the 1996 trials. ''It was pretty devastating at first.''</p>
        <p>Tonight he said, ''I turned that negative experience into positive motivation the next four years.''</p>
        <p>In the men's 200-meter breaststroke, Kyle Salyards, a 19-year-old from Lancaster, Pa., swam a smartly controlled race to win in 2 minutes 13.21 seconds. Tom Wilkens of Middletown, N.J., who had been favored to win three events at the trials only to finish a disappointing third in the 400-meter individual medley, made a charge in the final 100 meters and held on for second in 2:13.34. Ed Moses of Burke, Va., who had set an American record in the 100-meter breaststroke last Thursday, went out at world-record pace in the 200 but faded to fourth in 2:13.53.</p>
        <p>''My coach told me not to leave anything in the pool,'' Salyards said. ''I put everything I had into the last 50 meters.''</p>
        <p>In the women's 200-meter butterfly, Misty Hyman, 21, of Phoenix, who also missed the 1996 Olympic team by one spot, finished first tonight in 2:09.27. Kaitlin Sandeno of Lake Forest, Calif., qualified second in 2:09.54. Sandeno previously won the 400-meter individual medley last Wednesday.</p>
        <p>A teammate of Hyman's with the Stanford swim club, Jenny Thompson, swam the fastest time, 54.41, in the semifinals of the women's 100-meter freestyle.</p>
        <p>Lenny Krayzelburg, the world record-holder in the men's 200-meter backstroke, finished behind Aaron Peirsol, 17, of Irvine, Calif., in tonight's semifinals of that event. Krayzelburg, 24, of Los Angeles, has already lost once to Peirsol this season and is likely to be pushed in Monday's final. Peirsol swam 1:57.93 tonight, while Krayzelburg touched in 1:58.10.</p>
        <p>In the men's 100-meter freestyle, the congenial Walker swam with his usual unhurried style, pulling himself along with the power of his long arms, and he reached 50 meters in 22.71 seconds, more than half a second below the world-record pace of Aleksandr Popov of Russia. Walker could not sprint home with the same assertiveness, and Hall made a furious charge at the finish, but Walker did maintain enough form and composure to touch first.</p>
        <p>''He's pretty smooth,'' Krayzelburg said of Walker. ''He doesn't rush his strokes. It seems like he's thinking about every stroke.''</p>
        <p>Hall, 25, of Phoenix, appears to be more impulsive -- he wore leather pants to the starting blocks at the 1996 trials -- and he has a reputation as a slacker, but his determination has always been underestimated. He finished behind only Popov in the 50- and 100-meter freestyles at the Atlanta Games, won two relay gold medals and resurrected his career again tonight after several years of uncertainty.</p>
        <p>''There is a Clash song that says, 'I've been beat up and I've been thrown out, but I'm not down,' '' Hall said. ''That's me.''</p>
        <p>The son of Gary Hall Sr., a two-time Olympic swimming medalist in the 1970's, Hall appeared tonight wearing red, white and blue boxing trunks that resembled Apollo Creed's outfit in ''Rocky.'' He began punching the air when his name was announced, as if to show that he had not been knocked out by the marijuana suspension and the diagnosis of diabetes.</p>
        <p>In 1998, Hall was suspended from competition for three months by swimming's world governing body, known as FINA, after testing positive for marijuana. It was revealed at the time that Hall had also tested positive for marijuana at the Atlanta Games but had not been suspended because the drug was not then on the list of banned substances.</p>
        <p>He lost his endorsement contract with Speedo and legal fees withered his post-Olympic earnings. In March 1999, Hall was found to have diabetes. He has had to change his diet, reducing starches, and he sometimes has to give himself insulin shots during workouts and just before races.</p>
        <p>''I thought I was invincible before,'' Hall said. ''It was a real shock. It gave me a taste of mortality. That can be very sobering. When you stand on the blocks, you like to think you are invincible.''</p>
        <p>He did not even qualify for the Olympic trials until last month and surprised even himself by swimming so fast through three rounds. ''I'm just thrilled to have made it,'' Hall said. ''I'm really stoked.''</p>
        <p>He also made it known here that he was no longer a Deadhead, obsessively following the music of the Grateful Dead.</p>
        <p>Asked whom he listened to now, Hall said, ''Bach, Sebastian.''</p>
        <p>Which movement? he was asked.</p>
        <p>''Greatest hits,'' he said.</p>
