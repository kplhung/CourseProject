        <p>More than 3,500 protesters, from gay rights to animal rights activists,  marched through Los Angeles today, the eve of the Democratic National Convention, demanding the end of capital punishment and a new trial for a death row inmate, the convicted murderer Mumia Abu-Jamal.</p>
        <p>After two hours of music, poetry and speeches at a rally downtown condemning the death penalty and ''corporate greed,'' the demonstrators marched for about a mile under a blazing sun along downtown streets, lined with police officers guarding stores and office buildings,  to the heavily watched Staples Center, the site of the convention and the home of the city's basketball and hockey teams. There, there was more music, poetry and speeches.</p>

        <p>More than 3,500 protesters, from gay rights to animal rights activists,  marched through Los Angeles today, the eve of the Democratic National Convention, demanding the end of capital punishment and a new trial for a death row inmate, the convicted murderer Mumia Abu-Jamal.</p>
        <p>After two hours of music, poetry and speeches at a rally downtown condemning the death penalty and ''corporate greed,'' the demonstrators marched for about a mile under a blazing sun along downtown streets, lined with police officers guarding stores and office buildings,  to the heavily watched Staples Center, the site of the convention and the home of the city's basketball and hockey teams. There, there was more music, poetry and speeches.</p>
        <p>Mr. Abu-Jamal, a former radio journalist, has been on Pennsylvania's death row since his 1982 conviction for killing a Philadelphia police officer. Mr. Jamal's supporters around the world say he was railroaded and deserves a new trial. His detractors say he is a ''cold-blooded cop killer'' who turned a young bride into a widow.</p>
        <p>His case has become an international cause, and for many protesters he has become the face of death row.</p>
        <p>The rally at the downtown square took on aspects of a festival and a funeral. Although their words were definite, speaker after speaker reminded the crowd that time was running out for Mr. Abu-Jamal. The actor Ed Asner, a longtime opponent of capital punishment, said: ''We must fight the establishment, and we must fight the press. This fight is for the nation's soul. Mumia must not die.''</p>
        <p>Scores of police officers quietly stood by on the edge of the square named in honor of the World War I general John J. Pershing. Dozens of officers on motorcycles were stationed on nearby streets, and Joe R. Hicks, executive director of the city's Human Relations Commission, and his staff wandered through the crowd.</p>
        <p>''We expect it to be peaceful,'' Mr. Hicks said. ''But the death penalty is a highly volatile issue.''</p>
        <p>Pam Africa, a leader of the effort to win Mr. Abu-Jamal a new trial, came to Los Angeles from Philadelphia, where she also organized a similar demonstration during the Republican National Convention. ''We're here to educate people,'' she said. ''A lot of people just vote blindly. We want people to know that when it comes to capital punishment, there is no difference between the Democrats and the Republicans. They're both killers.''</p>
