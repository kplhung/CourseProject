        <p>Manuel Santana, who drives for a car service in Washington Heights, has known for months that city officials are requiring livery cars to be outfitted with bulletproof partitions or security cameras.</p>
        <p>He has even known that the city, alarmed by a spate of shootings of livery drivers this year, would provide $325 to each driver, enough to cover installation of a partition and about half the cost of a camera.</p>
        <p>But yesterday, two days after a city deadline requiring drivers to comply with the safety measures, the Plymouth Voyager van that Mr. Santana drives still lacked the safety devices. The reason, Mr. Santana said, is that he prefers the camera but lacks the money to cover it.</p>
        <p>''The deadline was last week, so I know I'm taking a risk,'' said Mr. Santana, 38, a driver for two years, as he got into his van at Kennedy Radio Dispatch, a car service on Broadway and 156th Street. ''But I'm going to do it in one or two weeks, as soon as I have the money.''</p>
        <p>Interviews with drivers at two large car services in Washington Heights yesterday indicated that most had complied with the regulations, adopted on April 18 by the Taxi and Limousine Commission.</p>
        <p>But finding cars without partitions or cameras was not difficult, and a partner in one of the largest car services in the neighborhood -- Riverside Radio Dispatch at 192nd and St. Nicholas Avenue -- estimated that half the 400 cars dispatched by the company lacked the safeguards.</p>
        <p>''They are worried,'' the partner, Carlos Vidal, said of the drivers, explaining that they believe they will be ticketed. ''That's the theme of the day. And it's not just because of the T.L.C., but it's because of the police.''</p>
        <p>Diane McGrath-McKechnie, the chairwoman of the Taxi and Limousine Commission, said the agency was not yet giving out tickets.</p>
        <p>''The officers are not issuing summonses; they are giving reminders to comply,'' Ms. McGrath-McKechnie said. ''This will go on for a week.'' After that, she said, drivers caught working without the safeguards will be fined $350 and face having their registration suspended.</p>
        <p>Since the commission passed the rules, about 7,700 livery cabs have been equipped with partitions and an additional 1,200 have been outfitted with surveillance cameras, which are placed next to the rearview mirror and continuously photograph passengers.</p>
        <p>Allan Fromberg, a spokesman for the commission, said there were up to 31,000 livery cars in the city, but he was uncertain how many had the safety devices before the new rules were announced.</p>
        <p>Ten livery drivers were killed in the city from Jan. 1, when Kuldip Singh, 25, was shot in Astoria, Queens, to May 17, when Kim Hong Tim, 20, died in the Bronx. Eleven drivers were slain in all of 1999.</p>
        <p>The killings led to an outcry and prompted the police to increase patrols and embark on a program that used undercover officers as decoys to catch robbers who prey on livery drivers.</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani also created a $5 million city program to provide a $325 reimbursement to each livery driver who has a partition or camera installed by a city-authorized dealer.</p>
        <p>Despite the city's assistance, however, there were still drivers like Jose Rodriguez, 33, without a partition or a surveillance camera. A driver for Riverside, Mr. Rodriguez said he wanted to install the camera but had hesitated to pay the difference between the $325 city grant and the $700 he needed.</p>
        <p>Drivers said they favored the cameras -- despite the expense -- because the partitions make it impossible to adjust the seats. The drivers said partitions also marred the vehicles, which tend to be expensive Lincoln Town Cars that double as family cars, and passengers dislike them because they obstruct air conditioning or heating.</p>
        <p>''My customers don't like it at all,'' said Hector Pena, a driver for Riverside who nevertheless installed a partition in his car. ''It's not comfortable. When they call, they even say they want a car without a partition.''</p>
        <p>Jose M. Nunez, a driver for Kennedy, said he, too, did not like the idea of putting in a partition. A driver for seven years, he said he had never been robbed. But he went with the partition to comply with the law.</p>
        <p>''I put in the partition because I wanted to get it taken care of,'' he said. ''The camera is also a big expense.''</p>
