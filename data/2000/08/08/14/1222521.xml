        <p>TO understand how different the development of the Internet has been in Japan than in the United States, consider the plight of Hiroaki Kobayashi.</p>
        <p>A veteran telecommunications entrepreneur who started one of the first modem companies in Japan and then sold it to AT&amp;T, Mr. Kobayashi is now the president and founder of Tokyo Metallic, a struggling Japanese provider of high-speed, or broadband, Internet access lines.</p>
        <p>His company is trying to jump start the development of a type of broadband telephone-line technology known as digital subscriber line, or DSL. But while Internet access through DSL is booming in the United States, Mr. Kobayashi's business is barely sputtering. There are fewer than 1,000 DSL customers in Japan, split between his company and one lone competitor.</p>
        <p>In the United States, the incumbent Bell phone companies and their start-up competitors, known as CLEC's, are now closing in on a million DSL subscribers nationally, according to the Cahners Instat market research group. And Internet access by high-speed cable television lines is quickly reaching even higher numbers in the United States.</p>
        <p>But here in Japan, Tokyo Metallic's tiny band of entrepreneurs is facing many obstacles, not the least of which is the giant Japanese telephone company Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which currently has a competing strategy for wiring Japan with high-speed fiber optic cables.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the Japanese telephone industry invested heavily in an early version of a digital technology known as ISDN -- a type of phone service much slower than DSL and only slightly faster than modem data sent over a standard, analog phone line that many people in the United States still use for Internet access.</p>
        <p>Although NTT has recently made overtures to the American DSL companies, industry executives said that the telecom giant was in no rush to invest in DSL -- in part because it is still anxious to retrieve its investment in ISDN.</p>
        <p>For all the landline forces working against him, though, the biggest challenge to Mr. Kobayashi's vision of wiring Japan has nothing to do with wires at all. Just the opposite, in fact. The Japanese are heading onto the Internet in droves -- by wireless means.</p>
        <p>Currently, according to InfoCom Research, there are between 20 million and 27 million Internet users in Japan, or approximately one of every five people in the nation. Of that number, nearly half -- some 10 million -- are connecting to the Internet wirelessly. Of these wireless customers, 7.5 million are using a service called i-mode, offered by NTT DoCoMo, NTT's wireless division. For nearly two of three i-mode users, this wireless link is their only method of access to the Internet.</p>
        <p>InfoCom forecasts that the percent of Japanese population connected wirelessly to the Internet will increase to more than 85 percent by 2003, compared with only about 60 percent connected by fixed-line networks.</p>
        <p>That trend suggests that people here are likely to use and experience the Internet much differently than they do in the United States, where so far only a fraction of Internet users have wireless access.</p>
        <p>Japan's wireless Internet explosion was set off last year by the introduction of NTT DoCoMo's i-mode cellular phones, which are capable of sending and receiving data. And now competing with the i-modes are an increasingly popular type of cellular phone known as PHS that supports data speeds of 64,000 bits a second -- as fast as the wired, ISDN digital phone lines here.</p>
        <p>What's more, Japan is now moving quickly to a second generation of wireless Internet technology, which promises higher data speeds and a variety of location-sensing commercial services that are likely to be embraced by business customers.</p>
        <p>But this is far more than a business revolution. One has only to sit in a Japanese subway car watching teenagers communicating via the Internet cell phones, or wander the stores of the Akihabara, Tokyo's electronics district, where there are literally hundreds of different voice, data and data-voice handset models on display, to grasp the momentum of the wireless Net in Japan.</p>
        <p>In advertisements and in interviews, Keiji Tachikawa, chief executive and president of NTT DoCoMo, has been sketching out his vision of a next-generation digital cellular network to be initiated early next year, when DoCoMo plans to offer five types of wireless Internet access devices that will further blur the line between cell phones and computers.</p>
        <p>It is a prophecy that has led many observers of the Internet in Japan to conclude that the wired world may increasingly become an afterthought for most Internet users here.</p>
        <p>''Japan is more mobile and less people are home,'' said Joichi Ito, an Internet pioneer in Japan who now heads Neoteny, a Tokyo-based Internet business incubator. ''Most people don't have living rooms here, and wiring is very high-cost.''</p>
        <p>There are also other cultural factors that explain the wireless versus wired split. Andrew Seybold, an American wireless expert who visited here this summer to study the Japanese wireless market, points to a variety of reasons that the wireless Internet has taken faster, firmer root in Japan than in the United States: better wireless coverage, pricing on par with prices for wired service and the fact that for many people, particularly teenagers, the wireless phone is their only phone.</p>
        <p>Mr. Seybold also noted the strong cultural factors that have driven the success of the i-mode phone in Japan, particularly popular ''killer applications,'' like train schedules, wireless banking and games.</p>
        <p>Japanese designers seem to have understood the user interface issues in a way that American designers have not, Mr. Seybold said. ''In Japan you can get to the train schedule with two clicks,'' he said. ''When I try to find a plane flight on a U.S. cell phone, I have to go through seven menu levels before I can even enter the flight number.''</p>
        <p>One likely consequence of the diverging approaches to the Web is that Japan, and by extension Asia, may be reaching the next generation of the Internet far sooner than the United States.</p>
        <p>Whether that means that the next generation of technology innovation and competitive advantage will follow the Web westward across the Pacific Ocean remains to be seen. Meanwhile, Hiroaki Kobayashi can only hope that Tokyo Metallic  doesn't become completely swamped by the wireless wave.</p>
