        <p>Women, it is clear, are not passing hour upon hour at their computers watching the online equivalent of ''General Hospital.''</p>
        <p>A new survey shows that women go online for practical reasons, like shopping, travel reservations and to seek specific information, and tend to be loyal to a few chosen sites. Men, on the other hand, tend to roam around, sometimes looking for amusement.</p>
        <p>''There is one thing women don't want to do online: linger in front of their monitors with a cup of Cafe Vienna,'' said Jesse Berst, editor of ZDNet Anchor Desk, an industry newsletter. The reason? Simply put: ''Women are more pressed for time,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The survey, ''It's a Woman's World Wide Web,'' was conducted by Jupiter Communications with Media Metrix. Besides examining the sexes' online behavior, it showed that for the first time, women outnumber men online, with a 50.4 percent share of the online population.</p>
        <p>''Women are interested in a more efficient experience -- getting online and getting off,'' said Anya Sacharow, an analyst at Jupiter. ''Men are more interested in technology for technology's sake, and in the more random aspects of Net surfing.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Sacharow said the survey pointed to different priorities. Women are ''often juggling kids, jobs and taking care of the house,'' she said. ''Men more often than not are only responsible for themselves.''</p>
        <p>The study found that older women use the Internet to make their lives easier. Bolstering this notion that women go online to simplify their lives rather than fulfill them, the study found that many consumer product sites had disproportionate numbers of female visitors.</p>
