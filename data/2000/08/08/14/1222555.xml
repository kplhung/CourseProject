        <p>Maybe it was the sunshine and palm trees. Maybe it was the prospect of celebrity-stuffed parties in the Hollywood Hills. Or maybe there just seemed a bit more news to fuss over in the lead-up to the Democratic National Convention.</p>
        <p>Whatever the case, the truffle hounds of the networks, cable channels and World Wide Web sites appeared more invigorated today than they did two weeks ago on the eve of the Republican gathering in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>''Finally, it's the Democrats' time to party,'' CNN's Bill Press enthused.</p>
        <p>Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, the vice-presidential candidate, made the same rounds of Sunday talk programs that his Republican counterpart, Dick Cheney, made two weeks ago. This time, it seemed like a battle of the research departments, as each program tried to dig up examples of how Mr. Lieberman had differed on issues with Vice President Al Gore. School vouchers. Privatizing Social Security. Bashing Hollywood. ''You've got a great research team,'' Senator Lieberman said to Tim Russert of NBC at one point.</p>
        <p>The Fox News lead-in to its interview said Mr. Lieberman was ''making waves as the first Jewish vice-presidential candidate'' and would be ''taking off the gloves.'' And as the senator answered questions from the Fox interviewer, Tony Snow, the words ''letting loose'' were emblazoned on the screen below him.</p>
        <p>Really? This was letting loose? Maybe in Connecticut.</p>
        <p>The genial Mr. Lieberman answered pretty much the same questions in pretty much the same way he had all day (although his answers did get more detailed and focused as the day wore on, perhaps a tribute to the Democrats' own research team).</p>
        <p>Several of the Web sites and Sunday news programs provided reports from Saturday's night's celebrity gala in Brentwood, at which stars like Shirley MacLaine, Cher, Melissa Etheridge and Paul Anka paid tribute to Bill and Hillary Clinton. ''You ignite in others things we have not resolved in ourselves,'' Ms. MacLaine was quoted in one report as telling the first couple.</p>
        <p>No translation was provided.</p>
        <p>Writing for Inside.com, Michael Cieply said that by convention's end, so many entertainers would have appeared that ''you might just forget how dull politicians really are.''</p>
        <p>Several commentators made their lead-in to the convention a look at recent movies and television series about politicians. On CBS, the ''Sunday Morning'' television critic John Leonard played a clip from TNT's ''Running Mates,'' in which Tom Selleck, as a presidential nominee who has just embraced campaign finance reform, is serenaded at the convention with chants of ''America's not for sale!''</p>
        <p>Cut back to Mr. Leonard: ''And I am the Shah of Iran,'' he said.</p>
        <p>It took Cokie Roberts of ABC's ''This Week'' to point out that the Democratic convention was opening during a full moon, an observation that caused her fellow commentators to erupt in giggles. Sam Donaldson was still chuckling several minutes later. ''Cokie,'' he said, ''you're wonderful.''</p>
        <p>The National Journal, on its convention Web page, peered into the world of limousine liberals.</p>
        <p>''We're expecting it to be like the Oscars, the Olympics, the Super Bowl and the World Cup all rolled into one for a week,'' said Jim Baron of Rely Transportation. However, many celebrities and tycoons, he said, were opting for less conspicuous town cars, fearing limousines might attract protesters. Indeed, A-List Limousine was offering, for a slight extra charge, an armed guard with each limousine.</p>
        <p>How many people will actually watch the Democratic convention on television? Fox asked visitors to its Web site. As of this afternoon, 25.8 percent said they would watch, 65.7 percent said they would not and the rest were not sure.</p>
        <p>''This is not a scientific poll,'' Fox cautioned. No kidding. But still, here was a group of people who had already taken the trouble to log on to a political Web site and then to vote on this question, and even they didn't intend to watch.</p>
        <p>Maybe they would if it were more like the fractious Reform Party convention, which resulted last week in two presidential candidates, the conservative pundit Pat Buchanan and a physicist, John Hagelin, each claiming the true crown.</p>
        <p>Mr. Buchanan appeared on ''Meet the Press'' and said that, despite appearances, the party was really pretty united behind him. ''It's casting off the old shell and growing a new one,'' he said.</p>
        <p>We've had the New Deal, the New Frontier and the New Covenant, so why not the New Shell?</p>
