        <p>Destin, Fla, once known as 'World's Luckiest Fishing Village,' is in throes of such rapid growth and development that it is losing small-town flavor; city of condominiums has grown from sand of seaside village; tourists and part-time residents are drastically altering landscape and robbing it of its charm; map; photo (M)</p>

        <p>The sand dunes of Okaloosa Island, like snowbanks, line both sides of U.S. Highway 98 between Fort Walton and Destin, and they are so pretty that people weave off the road, looking at them.

        <p>The sand dunes of Okaloosa Island, like snowbanks, line both sides of U.S. Highway 98 between Fort Walton and Destin, and they are so pretty that people weave off the road, looking at them. The golden sea oats waft in the summer breeze, and gnarled pines, blasted by hurricanes that hit or barely missed, lean from sand so purely white that the sun flashes off it like a mirror and hurts the eyes.</p>
        <p>To the south, beyond the dunes, is the Gulf of Mexico, an emerald green when the sun is out and a deep, deep blue on cloudy days. And across the spit of the sand, to the north, is a wide bay, its water darker, a place where wading birds prowl the shallows, spearing fish and crabs.</p>
        <p>But at 55 miles an hour, this three-mile stretch of protected, mostly undeveloped federal land flashes past in an instant. In the amount of time it takes a tourist to tune his car radio, the little oasis is gone.</p>
        <p>And looking around at what has become of the rest of this part of the Florida Panhandle on each side of that stretch of sand, part of Eglin Air Force Base, it is enough to make some visitors wonder if what they saw was even real.</p>
        <p>Concrete condominiums, as imposing as anything in Miami or Fort Lauderdale, line the beachfront on both ends of this paradise, blocking views of the Gulf. Tower cranes in the distance promise more.</p>
        <p>Thick traffic on 98 moves like syrup on a cold day, and turning left against the gridlock, to one of the gigantic new seafood emporiums that look almost like amusement parks with their expanse of neon, can be hair rending. The real estate people have a term for this kind of growth: ''Turning sand into money.''</p>
        <p>Fort Walton, to the west, is ''built out,'' the locals like to say, but to the east, at Destin and beyond, the building boom is still raging. Destin, which had long been regarded as one of the last little jewels of coastal old Florida, has been transformed into a coastal city of condominiums.</p>
        <p>''We have been discovered,'' said  Commissioner Nick Nicholson of Okaloosa County.</p>
        <p>It didn't happen overnight, it just seems like it to people who come only every few years. The Panhandle has been a prize for developers for decades. Destin, once known as the World's Luckiest Fishing Village, has been growing and changing for years.</p>
        <p>Now the village is gone, at least the village that older people here remember.</p>
        <p>The fishing is no longer so lucky.</p>
        <p>''It's kind of heartbreaking to see it turn into a concrete jungle,'' said Dewey Destin, 47, great-great-grandson of the town's founder, Leonard Destin.</p>
        <p>''It's a bittersweet feeling,'' said Mr. Destin, a part-owner of Destin Seafood Market and a city councilman since 1985. ''There are more jobs, and the properties are worth more money.</p>
        <p>''And it has destroyed our community. It has destroyed the local natural fishery. We now have much dirtier water. But this is what you get when you exchange nature for economic well-being.''</p>
        <p>People used to saunter across 98 in their bathing suits. Now, they wait for a break in the traffic, and run as if a mean dog were after them.</p>
        <p>''If I had a choice, I would have restricted the development to have low density,'' said Mr. Destin, who points out that most zoning during the early boom years was handled by the county, not the city. ''I would have done it much differently.''</p>
        <p>The population statistics show growth, but do not show the true changes in Destin and the surrounding coast. In 1970, the population of Okaloosa County was 88,188, according to state statistics. By 1990, it had climbed to 143,776, and by 1999 it had climbed to almost 180,000.</p>
        <p>But the tourists and the part-time residents have truly altered the landscape, real estate figures show.</p>
        <p>In 1990, there were 194 sales of new condos in southern Okaloosa County, which includes Destin, and in rapidly developing southern Walton County, to the east.</p>
        <p>In 1999, there were 937 sales of new condos, many of which will be vacant for part or even much of the year, or leased to tourists.</p>
        <p>The boom shows no sign of stopping. Sales of condos and town houses here almost doubled in just the past year.</p>
        <p>Real estate developers say Destin and much of the rest of the Florida Panhandle have become a playground of the new, fat economy.</p>
        <p>''Because of the boom, baby boomers and e-commuters are purchasing places as second homes or working from their homes here,'' said Dave W. Hubbard, a broker. ''The younger generations are getting their money early on and coming to play on the water. Condos are starting at $300,000 and going to $1.4 million. That's about average for a Gulf view.''</p>
        <p>Some residents say it had to happen sooner or later, and make no excuses for the transformation.</p>
        <p>''We knew that we weren't going to be able to keep this beauty secret for a long time,'' said Michael Beaubien, who owns Born to Boogie Charter Boat Fishing. ''How could we put a fence around us and say, 'No, get out'?''</p>
        <p>''Developers are not going to sit there and say, 'We'll take care of this land and leave it as a habitat for the redheaded woodpecker,' '' Mr. Beaubien continued. ''It's just not realistic to think that.''</p>
        <p>But people who loved it for what it was hate what it is.</p>
        <p>''Storm water runoff has affected the bay, and all the fertilizers they put on the golf courses are killing it,'' said Jacquelyn L. Tatjes, a secretary at Sexton's Seafood, a place where locals and tourists have gone for years to get fresh shrimp and crabs to boil.</p>
        <p>Ms. Tatjes has lived here 25 years, after fleeing the building booms in California. Here it is, she said, all over again.</p>
        <p>''There's no way a local can even go to the beach,'' she said. ''They say there's public access, but there's no parking. You can't even see the beach anymore.''</p>
        <p>And the new people have no connection to the place, beyond their time-share agreement or deed, longtime locals say.</p>
        <p>''They're rude. Instead of accepting our heritage of a small town, they just want to change it,'' Ms. Tatjes said. ''They want it to be just like where they came from. It's lost all its charm.''</p>
        <p>As soon as the value of her property peaks, she said, she is moving.</p>
        <p>Others have already left.</p>
        <p>Evan Bergwall is now a senior vice president at a bank in Neosho, Mo., a small city outside Joplin. Mr. Bergwall and his family left Destin this year, for good, after living here 10 years. ''What I went there for disappeared,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''As a place to get away,'' he said, ''it isn't, anymore.''</p>
        <p>Like some exotic animal in a cage, the undeveloped stretch of land between Destin and Fort Walton is fenced off on the Gulf side. But people regularly cross the fence, climb the dunes and look at the water, and run or roll back down them.</p>
        <p>They commit a small disobedience, just to see what, once, this was all like.</p>
