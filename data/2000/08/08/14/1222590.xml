        <p>As Democrats prepared to kick off their national convention here on Monday, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the party's candidate for vice president, sought today to minimize his differences with Vice President Al Gore on some of the leading issues of the campaign. But in the process he revealed a new and potentially contentious one, saying proposals to raise the retirement age for Social Security and Medicare should be ''kept on the table'' for further discussion.</p>
        <p>Speaking on five news shows, Mr. Lieberman acknowledged that he had held different positions from Mr. Gore on an array of issues, from affirmative action to school vouchers to tort law changes. But he scoffed at assertions that his views were closer to the Republicans' than to Mr. Gore's, and he praised the vice president for having had the confidence to select a running mate who differed with him on important subjects.</p>
        <p>''It is again a mark of Al Gore's strength of leadership that he didn't look for somebody who had 100 percent agreement with him,'' Mr. Lieberman said on NBC's ''Meet the Press.'' ''We've argued, we've debated, and I think that's what progress comes from, particularly the willingness to look at new ideas.''</p>
        <p>Still, in explaining how he has come to agree with Mr. Gore on a core issue of the campaign -- whether to allow taxpayers to invest some of their Social Security payroll taxes in the markets -- Mr. Lieberman exposed another rift in their views. While Mr. Gore has insisted that he would not consider raising the retirement age for Social Security or Medicare, Mr. Lieberman said today that any debate on keeping the system solvent should include that idea.</p>
        <p>''We should keep it on the table for the good reason that people are living longer,'' Mr. Lieberman said on ''Meet the Press.'' Later, on CNN's ''Late Edition,'' Mr. Lieberman said, ''There is very little you take off the table if you want to be an honest public official.''</p>
        <p>Today's interviews capped a remarkable week for Mr. Lieberman, whose selection by Mr. Gore six days ago infused many Democrats with a new sense of optimism about the race. But the ability of television interviewers to throw Mr. Lieberman onto the defensive today, over his differences with Mr. Gore and his past criticisms of President Clinton, suggests a line of attack that the Republicans are likely to pursue relentlessly in the coming days.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has denounced the idea of raising the retirement age for Social Security, and the party's platform is unequivocal on the issue. Moreover, the Gore campaign has hammered the Republican candidate, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, for even considering the notion.</p>
        <p>But today, Mr. Gore's aides sought to play down the differences, saying that Mr. Lieberman supported Mr. Gore's broad plan to keep Social Security solvent through 2055 by using general tax revenues instead of raising the retirement age, cutting benefits or increasing taxes. The current retirement is scheduled to rise to 67 over the next several decades.</p>
        <p>''I think Mr. Lieberman was suggesting that at some future point, perhaps after 2055, that it might need to be considered,'' said Doug Hattaway, a spokesman for Mr. Gore. ''But not now.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore campaigned today in Ohio and Missouri, moving west for a Wednesday arrival in Los Angeles and a Thursday evening coronation as the party's standard-bearer.</p>
        <p>The Democrats are looking to their convention to cast Mr. Gore in a more appealing light, hoping to close what has been a double-digit lead for Mr. Bush in many polls.</p>
        <p>The four-day extravaganza has been choreographed to help Mr. Gore step out of President Clinton's shadow, but the president and his wife, Hillary, have been in town for two days, raising money, visiting supporters, soaking up attention -- and causing grumbling in the Gore camp.</p>
        <p>(Mr. Gore did little to build a sense of separation from the president today when he told The Associated Press that he would continue to seek Mr. Clinton's counsel after he leaves the White House.)</p>
        <p>Asked on Fox News whether he was worried that Mr. Clinton, who is scheduled to address the convention in prime time on Monday, might dominate the convention spotlight this week, William M. Daley, Mr. Gore's campaign chairman, said no. ''I think it's totally appropriate for him to be here to thank the Democrats, because the Democratic Party stood with him during good times and difficult times over the last eight years,'' Mr. Daley said. ''But after tomorrow night's speech -- which is an important speech for the president, for the campaign and for Democrats -- this is Al Gore's convention.''</p>
        <p>President Clinton and Mrs. Clinton appeared tonight at a reception organized by four Jewish groups on a set at Sony Studios in Culver City. Mr. and Mrs. Clinton spoke warmly of Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman, but the President also used the opportunity to recount a so-far-unsuccessful effort at Camp David to forge a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.</p>
        <p>''But I can tell you that significant progress was made at Camp David,'' Mr. Clinton said, adding that he would work every day for the remainder of his term to try to accomplish what he acknowledged remained an extrememly difficult goal.</p>
        <p>And in the midst of his sober recounting of the Camp David talks, Mr. Clinton offered a defense on a subject that Mr. Gore had been ridiculed for: his suggestion that he deserved credit for inventing the Internet. ''And by the way, Mr. Gore did sponsor the legislation'' that led to creating the Internet, Mr. Clinton said. ''Part of my job, since I'm not running is to correct the record here.''</p>
        <p>The Democrats are counting on the convention to show that they are every bit as unified as the Republicans. But some liberals have begun warning that Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman's centrist positions on important issues may have dampened enthusiasm for the ticket among vital parts of the party's base like union members and black voters.</p>
        <p>In his television appearances today, Mr. Lieberman tried to put to rest concerns that he differed significantly from Mr. Gore on major issues. He said that although he has voted for a pilot program for school vouchers, he would also increase federal spending on public schools. And he said that while he has raised concerns about affirmative action, he did not support efforts to ban it.</p>
        <p>He said Mr. Gore had encouraged him to argue his views vigorously -- in private. But in public, Mr. Lieberman said, a Gore administration would be firmly united. ''When he makes a decision, I know what the administration policy will be, his,'' the senator said on Fox.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman, the first Democrat to chastise President Clinton from the Senate floor about his affair with a White House intern, praised Mr. Clinton today for seeking repentance last week. But when asked whether he would place Mr. Clinton among the great presidents, as Mr. Gore has, Mr. Lieberman demurred.</p>
        <p>''You know, I'm going to leave the exact words for history,'' he said on ''Meet the Press.'' ''But I think he has done some great things as president, which makes the personal mistakes that he made even sadder.''</p>
