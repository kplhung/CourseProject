        <p>Let Tony Palombella tell you: In 17 years on the circuit, he has worked some pretty tough rooms, boy. There was the Bx40, which was murder, and the Bx9, no cakewalk.  ''Very hard crowd in the Bronx,'' he said. ''Hard to get a laugh.''</p>
        <p>Of course, that's not to say the Upper East Side was much easier. ''On the Upper East, they're more --  I would call them sedated. Your more elderly, more well-to-do people. They want to be by themselves and into their own world.'' In other words, hard to get a laugh.</p>

        <p>Let Tony Palombella tell you: In 17 years on the circuit, he has worked some pretty tough rooms, boy. There was the Bx40, which was murder, and the Bx9, no cakewalk.  ''Very hard crowd in the Bronx,'' he said. ''Hard to get a laugh.''</p>
        <p>Of course, that's not to say the Upper East Side was much easier. ''On the Upper East, they're more --  I would call them sedated. Your more elderly, more well-to-do people. They want to be by themselves and into their own world.'' In other words, hard to get a laugh.</p>
        <p>You couldn't exactly say Tony Palombella was getting much respect the other day, either, as he sat at the wheel of the M20, plowing down Seventh Avenue from Midtown. It was hot outside. His audience was sweating, scowling, silent. They had paid about a dollar and a half for a seat in this particular club, which holds 40 and serves no drinks (though some people bring their own).</p>
        <p>At 38th Street, Mr. Palombella looked through his big brown sunglasses into the rearview mirror -- kind of his way of parting the curtains. He grabbed his microphone, a telephone handset on the dashboard, then started with his best icebreaker. ''O.K., people. This is your bus driver speaking. It's only two days to the weekend. We can make it, people, we can make it. Now, would you like some comedy or a little trivia?''</p>
        <p>Nothing. Stony silence. Finally, a heckler in the third row piped up: ''O.K., trivia. But you've got to give us some new stuff. I've been with you before.'' A woman behind the heckler was more to the point; she got up and stomped out at the next stop, socking her floppy straw hat down over her frosted hair. ''For a dollar fifty, I need this?'' she said. ''I'm going to get on another bus. I think it's a gross invasion of my privacy.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Palombella did not seem to mind. He smiled. He bid her a good day. He pulled back into traffic and picked up the microphone again.</p>
        <p>He perseveres.</p>
        <p>He has been doing this -- staking his claim as New York's only comedian bus driver, telling jokes and dispensing trivia, offering advice and directions and compliments, trying very hard to spread a little cheer -- for almost as long as he has been a city bus driver. To spend a couple of days with him as he makes his way from Midtown to Battery Park City, back up to Central Park West and then south again, is to learn that even the best intentions sometimes do not count for much in New York City.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Palombella, whose placid persistence is a little like that of Rupert Pupkin, the would-be comedian played by Robert De Niro in ''The King of Comedy,'' has never let that slow him down. He knows that New Yorkers need what he has to offer them, even if they may not always know it themselves.</p>
        <p>How did York Avenue get its name? ''Who said that? No sir, 'the Duke of York' is wrong! It was named after Sgt. Alvin C. York, a World War I hero. In 1941, Gary Cooper played him in the movie 'Sergeant York.' ''</p>
        <p>What are some of the city's contributions to the world? ''The bagel, the pastrami, the martini and the toilet paper. All invented in New York City, people. The Oreo cookie was also a New York City invention.''</p>
        <p>What is the longest cross street in Manhattan? ''The winner will get a free bus map? Nobody? Nobody? Anybody? It's 14th Street. It is two and a half miles long. It also has Union Square. Union Square has the city's tallest flagpole, 128 feet.''</p>
        <p>What kind of coffee did they drink on the Titanic? ''Sanka.'' He adds: ''That's not for real. That's a joke.'' And the joke gets a little laugh. The room begins to loosen up a little.</p>
        <p>''When people get on the bus, it's like they've been tranquilized,'' Mr. Palombella observed. ''It's like they're in a coma, and it's my job to wake them up.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Palombella, 48, moved to the city with his family when he was 11, from a tiny town in central Italy called Gagliano. His father, a construction worker, had to juggle many jobs to make ends meet, and that made a deep impression on a young Tony Palombella. When a steady, secure job came along, he snapped it up and decided he would never leave it. Even if it sometimes was not the most exciting job in the world.</p>
        <p>That's where the comedy and the trivia came in. While plying the streets of the Bronx, he said, he realized that ''if I just drive this bus up and down for eight, nine hours a day, I'm going to turn into a robot.''</p>
        <p>He started making up jokes and hanging out on weekends at the New York City section of Barnes &amp; Noble, devouring whatever facts caught his fancy. ''I have a photographic memory; I read a paragraph and it's in here,'' he said, tapping his temple. His trivia may not always be textbook perfect -- the bagel, for example, was brought to New York by Jews from Eastern Europe -- but he is usually pretty much on the mark.</p>
        <p>He never knows when his constantly changing audience will gel into something resembling appreciation. His biggest fans are generally children and tourists, like Andrea Hidas, 22, from Budapest, on her way to the Port Authority Bus Terminal the other day. (Mr. Palombella explained to her why Houston Street is pronounced that way.)</p>
        <p>But he also has his local semi-regulars, like Irene Dodge, who got four street name questions right last week. Helen Tychnowitz, 87, who lives in Stuyvesant Town and was on the bus just to get out of the house, said, ''They really don't make many like Tony.'' She added, frowning a little: ''Some people are just too grouchy to appreciate him. But they've got their own problems.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Palombella hopes that one day he will meet someone as appreciative as Mrs. Tychnowitz, but maybe just a little younger. ''I am a single man,'' he explained while on a break, ''and I have a beautiful house in Morris Park in the Bronx. And I love beautiful women. I really love beautiful women. You can put that in the article if you want to.''</p>
        <p>In the meantime, he said, he will keep on driving and keep on talking. He says he thinks his comic timing is getting a lot better the older he gets.</p>
        <p>''It makes you feel like a celebrity, doing this,'' he said. ''I'm going to shed a few tears when I leave this job, that's for sure. What am I going to do for fun?''</p>
