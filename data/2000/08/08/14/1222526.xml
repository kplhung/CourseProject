        <p>''Le Coq Est Mort'' (''The Rooster Is Dead'') is on the face of it a fairly simple piece. The 70-minute work, performed by Company Jant-Bi this afternoon in the Ted Shawn Theater at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival here, begins with a brisk processional of men dressed in business suits and carrying attache cases. They begin to bond, to fight and to drink together, eventually shedding all but their trousers to regress to that essence of primitivism or the natural world, the lolloping ape.</p>
        <p>The voyage of self-discovery from frantic, soulless Wall Streeter to Noble Savage is a familiar enough theme in dance. But there is one big difference here. The eight men are black Africans, and the piece was created by Susanne Linke, a leading German Expressionist choreographer who happens to be white.</p>

        <p>''Le Coq Est Mort'' (''The Rooster Is Dead'') is on the face of it a fairly simple piece. The 70-minute work, performed by Company Jant-Bi this afternoon in the Ted Shawn Theater at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival here, begins with a brisk processional of men dressed in business suits and carrying attache cases. They begin to bond, to fight and to drink together, eventually shedding all but their trousers to regress to that essence of primitivism or the natural world, the lolloping ape.</p>
        <p>The voyage of self-discovery from frantic, soulless Wall Streeter to Noble Savage is a familiar enough theme in dance. But there is one big difference here. The eight men are black Africans, and the piece was created by Susanne Linke, a leading German Expressionist choreographer who happens to be white.</p>
        <p>''Le Coq Est Mort,'' set to a seamless weave of Shostakovich and music by Etienne Schwarcz and Abdou Mama Diouf, grew out of the participation of Ms. Linke and the dancers in collaboratory workshops in 1998. It has been criticized as cultural colonialism and racist by European intellectuals, both black and white. Germaine Acogny, the company's charismatic director, was herself troubled initially by the ape scene. But it did not bother the dancers and the townspeople of Toubab Dialaw, Senegal, where Jant-Bi is based and where the premiere took place last year.</p>
        <p>Clearly the piece would be quite a different matter if it were performed by white or Asian dancers, given the inbred bigotry that is so much a part of everyday life today in the United States and Europe. And the impact and impressive accomplishment of this disturbing yet strangely exhilarating piece is attributable in large part to its casting.</p>
        <p>Ms. Linke and the powerful dancers, each with a face and stage presence of his own in this putatively faceless chorus, take the audience through an arduous journey. It begins with movement whose plainness and repetition grow tedious and continues with insidiously building signs of disarray, symbolized by the churning and scuffing of the sand that covers the stage floor.</p>
        <p>Then comes the tension of witnessing racist-seeming imagery placed front and center, unashamedly and without defiance. Further shocks to the system come with the sudden devastation of the dance's last moments. Blasts of gunfire are heard. All but one of the apes drop into the sand, mourned by a single cheeping, increasingly frantic creature.</p>
        <p>Slowly and miraculously, however, his arms straighten like wings and the sound of animal chirps, crowing, barking and growls begins to rise from the bodies, muffled at first but growing stronger. The sounds turn to faint singing, which also grows louder as one by one the men rise and come forward. Their song, an anthem associated with Senegalese wrestling matches, ends ''Le Coq Est Mort.''</p>
        <p>There are considerable intellectual pleasures to the piece. One becomes fascinated by the gradual layering and melding of everyday and modern-dance movement with African dance forms and motifs of a sort that are revitalizing American modern dance today. As fascinating is the transition from stiff, upright contained movement to tilting, intricately articulated torsos and resilient bent-kneed travel. The stage picture is extraordinarily handsome, particularly in the ways Horst Muhlberger's quietly innovative lighting enhances small differences of color, texture and light and shadow.</p>
        <p>There are a few puzzling or loose philosophical ends. One jokey moment having to do with a first experiencing of Champagne does seem condescending. But this is a dance that provokes thought long after the curtain falls.</p>
        <p>Ms. Linke addresses man's growing alienation from his own physicality, an effect of his striving for power. Developing the piece, the dancers said that they found the ape movement technically challenging and inherently beautiful rather than demeaning.</p>
        <p>Viewers must be willing to loosen their grip on the constructs of racism and the parameters of Western physicality to embrace this journey into an unnerving unknown.</p>
        <p>The performers make this possible, especially the genially implacable Abubakar Usman and the febrile, almost painfully innocent Chrysogone Diangouaya. The fine cast was completed by Cire Beye, Djibril Diallo, Amadou Gueye, Moustapha Gueye, Papa Sy and Jean Tamba. Avi Kaiser was co-choreographer. Oumou Sy designed the costumes.</p>
