        <p>Just off 20th Avenue in Astoria, Queens, behind a steel and brick fence guarded by dogs, sits an old hulk of a power plant that was built when cars had fins and Uncle Miltie was the king of prime time. The plant, designed to burn coal, then oil, had become a symbol of power generation at its dirtiest and least efficient by the time it was closed in 1993.</p>
        <p>Seven years later, the surging demand for electricity is so intense in New York that even a derelict like Astoria Generating No. 2, as it is formally known, may get a second life. A Maryland-based company that bought the plant last year has proposed spending more than $15 million to repair and retool it for backup use on the city's peak energy-demand days in summer.</p>
        <p>In other words, the plant's half-century-old boiler would contribute its electricity -- and its unfiltered pollution -- only on the days when the city's air quality is already at its smoggy, ozone-laden worst. Meanwhile, the company's investment, at current wholesale energy prices, would be recouped in about a year whether the plant operates or not.</p>
        <p>New York City's energy bazaar has opened for business, and the proposed transformation of a Truman administration relic into a 21st-century cash cow is just the beginning. Altogether, at least 13 proposals for power plants across the city have been put forward over the last few months -- a staggering surge of power production that would equal more than five Indian Point 2 nuclear plants. If all were to be built, it would be the largest one-time power expansion in the city's history.</p>
        <p>The wave of proposals, coming at a time when blackouts, equipment failures and soaring energy costs have heightened public awareness about the delicate balance of electricity supply and demand, marks the beginning of a period of great promise and peril for New York, city officials, local community leaders and environmental experts say. Air quality, energy reliability and electricity costs are all at stake.</p>
        <p>And the political landscape on which the power debate will unfold over the next few years, with huge citywide coalitions of neighborhood groups, powerful out-of-state corporations, and a mayoral race on the horizon, is just as unexplored.</p>
        <p>''It's politics, it's power, it's money, it's everything,'' said Barbara Vetell, who lives in Greenpoint,  Brooklyn, across the street from the proposed East River site of one of the first plants moving through the state approval process. That plan was withdrawn this summer after a storm of local protest and what the developer said were economic changes that made the plant less attractive.</p>
        <p>The technology for generating electricity has advanced significantly since the mid-1970's, the last time a major plant was built in New York City, energy experts say. All the proposed plants would use either combined cycle generation, which uses far less fuel to produce the same amount of power, or cogeneration, which creates another energy product as part of the process.</p>
        <p>But because the electricity market has been deregulated, and current wholesale energy prices are so high, older, dirtier plants like Astoria No. 2 may still prove to be economically viable. Some experts say the city could ultimately end up with a lot more power plants but no improvement in air quality.</p>
        <p>The new dynamics of the energy market have resulted in far more proposals for plants than the city really needs, state and city officials say. Which ones get built and which ones do not -- and how free-market capital, environmentalism and local politics will shape that debate -- are questions that are only now being asked.</p>
        <p>The proposals have sharply divided environmentalists. Community groups have sprung up from the South Bronx to the Lower East Side of Manhattan and especially in Astoria, where much of the new power generation would be concentrated. And under state procedure, companies proposing power plants are required to help finance the groups that oppose them. That has created a potential cash pool of millions of dollars that could transform grass-roots organizations into powerful lobbying blocs.</p>
        <p>Politics and family traditions have merged. Peter F. Vallone, the City Council speaker and likely Democratic candidate for mayor next year, came into politics in the late 1960's, fighting against coal-burning plants in Queens. Now he has taken a lead role on the issue once again, pushing for a new pollution-emissions system that would give the city more control over how its energy is produced. His son, Peter F. Vallone Jr., is the lawyer for the largest group opposing new power plants in the city and has formed an exploratory committee to seek a City Council seat for himself.</p>
        <p>Gerald Norlander, executive director of the Public Utility Law Project, an Albany-based group that represents low-income energy and telecommunications consumers, said, ''We're in a pretty chaotic moment here.''</p>
        <p>In the regulated monopoly days, Mr. Norlander said, residents knew that if a power plant was built in their backyard, it would generate electricity for their community based on its needs. Now, he said, when power can be sold like lumber or steel or any other commodity, the perceived social costs of a power plant are higher because no community can be sure where its electricity will go.</p>
        <p>''We're in an era where the market sends a signal to build by spiking prices,'' he said. ''The planning process is completely different.''</p>
        <p>The Environment</p>
        <p>Orion Power Holdings Inc., the Maryland company that owns Astoria Generating -- a complex of five separate units built between 1951 and the early 1960's -- has characterized the resurrection of No. 2 as a stopgap measure. It would only be used for the next few years, or until newer, cleaner plants begin operation. Then, the company has said in its applications with the state, No. 2 would again be retired.</p>
        <p>The company has also said that because of the plant's antiquated air-emissions controls, it would limit operation of No. 2 to times of peak demand, and no more than about 37 days a year. Orion said the plant would burn only natural gas, which is a cleaner-burning fuel than the oil that was used during the plant's past life. Like many companies that operate older plants, Orion would make most of its profit by selling the plant's availability to begin operating -- a promise to deliver energy if needed -- rather than for actually  generating electricity full time, which plant officials say would be cost-prohibitive and would exceed pollution standards.</p>
        <p>At 170 megawatts, No. 2 would also be one of the smallest plants in New York City. A megawatt, or one million watts, is generally considered enough to supply power to about 250 single-family homes, or a larger number of apartments, at periods of peak demand. By contrast, the largest plant in the city, Ravenswood, just south of Astoria on the East River, can produce 2,168 megawatts.</p>
        <p>While Orion appears to have committed itself to closing down No. 2 eventually, according to its application to the State Department of Environmental Conservation, the reality is more complicated. Under its plan, Orion would expand power capacity by 499 megawatts at another of its Astoria units, Generating No. 3. By doing so, the company would be forced to shut down No. 2 because its output would exceed the authorized cap.</p>
        <p>But the application to restart No. 2 is much further along in the approval process and could receive a decision from the state as early as this month. The plan to increase power at No. 3 has not even reached the stage of a formal application.</p>
        <p>Energy experts say that while Astoria No. 2 is different from the 12 other plant proposals, which call for either new construction or expanding  capacity at existing facilities, it also underlines the central nagging issue of the electricity debate: When the new, cleaner plants start up, can anyone really be sure that the older, dirtier ones will really fade away? If the 499-megawatt expansion at Astoria should become derailed or denied, for example, might old No. 2 churn and belch its smoke for another generation?</p>
        <p>Industry officials and state regulators, including the chairwoman of the Public Service Commission, Maureen O. Helmer, have said that the raw pressures of the market will force out the older plants, which simply will not be able to compete with new technologies that can produce more energy at lower cost. Other politicians and environmentalists are not as sure.</p>
        <p>''These plants are half a century old and still going strong -- are we talking another half century?'' Speaker Vallone said. ''Many of these companies are bonding their existing property -- does that mean we wait 20 or 30 years until the bonds are paid off?''</p>
        <p>Some electricity experts say the power market is too volatile -- and demand in New York too voracious -- to predict what will happen to old plants like No. 2.</p>
        <p>''Once they get it up and running, there could be a lot of economic reasons for Orion to at least prolong and maximize the number of hours it can run,'' said Edward A. Smeloff, the executive director of the Pace Law School Energy Project, a research and advocacy group. ''If there's a pending availability crisis,'' he added, ''they'll have strong leverage to keep it in operation even longer.''</p>
        <p>Regulation and Politics</p>
        <p>Hardly anyone believes that all the proposed plants will be built. And in many ways, that is the crux of the matter. Exactly how many really  are needed? And where will they be built? Where is the line to be drawn between the powers of the free market and the authority of elected officials and regulators?</p>
        <p>The central problem, politicians and environmental groups say, is that under deregulation, no formal framework exists to consider all the power plants in a systematic way. The process is more like a pipeline, they say, with projects expected to emerge one by one for consideration, with the first ones more likely to be approved than the last, regardless of merit or location. Of the 13 plans, for example, some have been formally filed with the Public Service Commission, while others are still months from that step, and are still being evaluated by the organization that runs the state's power market, called the Independent System Operator.</p>
        <p>''You almost have to say no to all, because you just don't know what's going to happen -- there's no mechanism in place to make a tradeoff,'' said Ashok Gupta, an economist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a private conservation group.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gupta said his organization plans to support some of the plant proposals and oppose others, with the overall goal of reducing air pollution. But walking that line is a delicate business, he conceded, because it puts the organization in potential conflict with neighborhood groups that only see the plant in their neighborhood. The N.R.D.C. has taken no position yet on Astoria Generating No. 2. Other groups, like Environmental Advocates, a group based in Albany, have declined to get involved.</p>
        <p>Part of the problem for policy makers and environmental groups is that almost everything has changed since the last time major power plant construction was an issue in New York, in the early to mid-70's.</p>
        <p>Back then, the technology of power generation dictated huge plants of 1,000 megawatts or more, like Ravenswood and Astoria Generating, which can still produce 1,080 megawatts with only three of its five units operating.</p>
        <p>Then, there were only a few players -- the city, the state, and the local monopoly, Con Edison. Now there are multiple private corporations and partnerships.</p>
        <p>The State Board on Electric Generation Siting and the Environment, which is led by Ms. Helmer, the chairwoman of the Public Service Commission, is the primary authority for deciding where new power plants are built. Municipalities and community groups can contribute information, but the decision-making resides in Albany.</p>
        <p>Many people involved in the process describe a feeling of being between worlds -- the market for raw wholesale energy has been deregulated, but the delivery to the individual home is still a regulated monopoly. Competition was expected to drive down energy prices, but instead prices have gone up.</p>
        <p>Certainly, New York is not alone in its struggles. In California, which was one of the first states to deregulate electricity in 1996, some politicians are calling for a reconsideration of the issue as prices have soared this summer. Politicians in other states where deregulation is just beginning have asked for a time-out to reconsider. In New York, where deregulation has been introduced in stages beginning in 1997, few officials are calling for a return to the monopoly days, but the momentum to take back some control over the process appears to be growing.</p>
        <p>A bill being drafted in the City Council, for example, would give New York the authority to regulate the output of lead into the atmosphere. Lead is a small element of the pollution produced by plants, but the bill would give the city a handle on power generation that it does not now have, sponsors say.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, Gov. George E. Pataki signed a bill requiring Con Ed to give back more than $100 million to its customers, who have been paying higher energy bills this summer because of the shutdown of the Indian Point 2 plant in Buchanan, N.Y., this year.</p>
        <p>But risk and opportunity are also intermingled. Under state regulations, groups opposing a power plant can receive up to $1,000 per megawatt for consulting and engineering analysis, paid by the corporation seeking to build a plant.</p>
        <p>For the city as a whole, that creates a potential pool of about $3 million in so-called intervenor funds, with half going to local community groups and half to the city. Anthony J. Gigantiello, the president of the largest anti-plant group, Choke, for the Coalition Helping Organize a Kleaner Environment, said that meetings were held last week to try to organize one vast coalition that would confront the power companies on a united front.</p>
        <p>The Flow</p>
        <p>The first premise of every formulation about New York City's power supply is that the city exists in a pocket. Because of the limitations of the feeder system of stations that connect New York to the power grid upstate, most of the city's energy capacity must be produced from within its boundaries. Only so much can go in or out.</p>
        <p>But the pocket may soon have a hole in it.</p>
        <p>The Long Island Power Authority has received preliminary approval for a power line that would allow 300 megawatts of electricity to move under Long Island Sound between New England and Long Island. And while the idea of the line is that Long Island, which is also part of the local energy pocket and which is also facing a long-term energy shortfall, could buy power from companies in the New England states, power lines can move electricity in both directions.</p>
        <p>The possibility of a potential power drain to the east and north has in turn dredged up issues of class conflict in communities like the South Bronx and the Lower East Side, where residents say they fear their neighborhoods being polluted to power the homes of the Hamptons or suburban Massachusetts.</p>
        <p>In addition, many residents in neighborhoods like Washington Heights in Upper Manhattan, which suffered a major blackout during a period of peak demand last year, have said they believe their community was deliberately sacrificed when power ran short, despite the denials from Con Ed.</p>
        <p>Even some of the people who accept the argument that newer plants will help the city and regional air quality say that the proposed locations of the plants have raised issues of fairness.</p>
        <p>''It's partly an environmental justice issue that we're concentrating on here,'' said Susan Stetzer, vice president of the East River Environmental Coalition, which formed in February to fight a plan by a Con Ed subsidiary to expand energy production at its 13th Street plant in Manhattan. ''While the city over all would have less pollution, the Lower East Side, which already has a disproportionate amount of asthma, will bear the burden,'' Ms. Stetzer said.</p>
