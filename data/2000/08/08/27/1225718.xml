        <p>In a testament to the resourcefulness of capitalists, a South Korean insurance man has found a way to make money from the image of the leader of Communist North Korea, the stern-faced, curly-haired Kim Jong Il.</p>
        <p>Bai Eun Shik, 53, has been a dead ringer for Mr. Kim for years, ever since Mr. Bai got himself a permanent wave to camouflage his thinning hair. But now, as relations between the two Koreas begin to warm a little, Mr. Bai is using his resemblance to North Korea's Dear Leader, as Mr. Kim is known, to sell himself and other products of capitalism.</p>
        <p>Since winning a Kim Jong Il look-alike contest several months ago, Mr. Bai has landed lucrative advertising contracts for therapeutic mattresses, a security company and a computer manufacturer.</p>
        <p>But the most deliciously paradoxical advertisement is the one in which Mr. Bai, like a Korean Crazy Eddie, hawks a high-tech touch-tone phone service: North Korea's communications system is mired in the 1950's, and most of its residents have little access even to rotary telephones.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bai is set to begin work on a movie in which he will play Mr. Kim, and he clearly relishes his newfound celebrity. ''I don't know how he is perceived in political circles, but among ordinary people he is very well received,'' Mr. Bai said. ''Little children come up to me on the street and ask for my autograph.''</p>
