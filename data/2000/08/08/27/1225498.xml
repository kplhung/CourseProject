        <p>KEVIN SMITH is such an engaging personality that I feel guilty finding his movies too sophomoric and one-note. There is a lone exception: his 1994 debut, ''Clerks,'' is a fast, furious, and raucously funny variation on a single joke.</p>
        <p>But none of Mr. Smith's subsequent pictures have even approached the comic consistency of ''Clerks.'' That includes the latest of his films to be released on DVD, ''Chasing Amy,'' his third feature, which, upon its 1997 release, revived his reputation after the tepid ''Mallrats'' (1995).</p>
        <p>''Chasing Amy'' (Miramax Home Entertainment/The Criterion Collection, 113 minutes, $32.95) is Mr. Smith's very 90's take on the romance between a comic book artist (Ben Affleck) and the woman (Joey Lauren Adams) he meets who is perfect in every way but one: she's a lesbian. It caused critical panegyrics that described it as pointed and poignant.</p>
        <p>Now that the movie has become available in a ''deluxe'' DVD edition -- with more than 30 minutes of deleted scenes and outtakes and an audio commentary by Mr. Smith, Mr. Affleck and others -- there's bound to be the impression that the film is more important than it really is.</p>
        <p>The trouble with ''Chasing Amy'' is its essential shallowness, an inability to rise above the comic book mentality of its protagonist. Mr. Smith's dialogue, which has always been his movies' strong point in both its wisecracking and its deadpan wit, fails to be convincing, even when it turns serious and tries for truthfulness.</p>
        <p>Still, the DVD is a must-have, even if the movie isn't, because the self-effacing Mr. Smith may be the best audio commentator around. He says straight out that ''this is as good as it gets,'' referring to a semi-inventive camera movement. (No one has ever called Mr. Smith a great visual director.) And his newly recorded introduction gives him the chance to apologize -- sort of -- for his voiceover comments on an earlier, laser-disc version, in which he disparaged the then-fledgling DVD in favor of the laser disc.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith's ready wit can also be heard on two other DVDs. Both ''Clerks'' (Miramax Home Entertainment, 94 minutes, $39.98) and ''Mallrats'' (Universal Home Video, 96 minutes, $29.98) contain his typically caustic and often hilarious commentary, as well as many essential extras, including the much darker original ending of ''Clerks'' and the original (and superior) 20-minute opening sequence of ''Mallrats,'' not shown in theaters.</p>
        <p>Too bad that the DVD of Mr. Smith's latest comedy, ''Dogma'' (Columbia Tristar Home Video, 125 minutes, $24.98), has none of the bonuses that make the other three essential. If any of Mr. Smith's movies cries out for discussion of how it was made and what troubles were waiting after it was finished, it's this overlong, spotty but often hilariously irreverent fantasia about two renegade angels (Matt Damon and Mr. Affleck) trying to return to heaven with the help of a lapsed-Catholic abortion clinic worker (Linda Fiorentino). Hearing Mr. Smith tell of how he infiltrated a group of protesters at a ''Dogma'' festival screening would be worth the price of the disc.</p>
        <p>But the ''Dogma'' disc has virtually none of the things -- save for the obligatory trailer -- that makes ''Clerks,'' ''Mallrats'' and ''Chasing Amy,'' however erratic they are as movies, so indispensable as additions to DVD libraries.</p>
