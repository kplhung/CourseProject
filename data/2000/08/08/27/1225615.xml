        <p>My family was eating lunch on the observation deck at Spring Lake's beach. A loud intermittent buzz coming from behind a low wall was destroying our serenity. Finally, I stood and craned my neck to see what it was. Two lifeguards were taking turns shaving their heads over a trash can.</p>

        <p>(With apologies to the author of Proverbs 6:16)</p>
        <p>There are six things</p>
        <p>the Lord hates,</p>
        <p>yes, seven are an</p>
        <p>abomination to Him;</p>
        <p>tailgaters, lane weavers,</p>
        <p>those who eschew</p>
        <p>turn signals or get into the wrong</p>
        <p>toll lane; those who proceed too</p>
        <p>slowly in passing lanes, or merge</p>
        <p>unsafely, these are</p>
        <p>forgiven by the Lord.</p>
        <p>And this is yet another</p>
        <p>reason you should be</p>
        <p>thankful since He is obviously</p>
        <p>much more tolerant of</p>
        <p>your driving</p>
        <p>than I.</p>

        <p>Recently a small boy accompanied his mother into the Maywood post office. While she joined the line of customers, he made a beeline for the mechanical postal scale on the side counter. Too preoccupied to notice his mother's repeated instructions to join her, he proceeded to weigh a pen, the sponge container and various postal supplies. He then solicited his mother's keys and two of the smaller packages she carried. When he triumphantly announced the weight of her cell phone, I cheered silently for a small victory of simplicity over technology.</p>

        <p>Okay, Big Brother,</p>
        <p>I vote you out of my house</p>
        <p>with one remote click.</p>
        <p>Goodbye to Karen.</p>

        <p>It only rains in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>We had five box-seat tickets to the Mets-Giants game that was to start at 7:10. In late morning, we drove down to Princeton in a torrential downpour. It rained the entire time we were there. About mid-afternoon we headed back toward North Jersey, also in the rain. On the radio, all they could talk about was the flooding in New Jersey. The sky in the west was dark and threatening. On the road about 5 p.m. we gambled that the game would be called and headed home to Millburn. At about 6 or so while watching the sports and weather, found out that the storm, rather than moving west to east, which is the usual flow, was heading east to west. It hadn't rained in New York and the game was played on schedule and in full. I gambled and lost about $150. at least we didn't watch the Mets gets pounded 11 to 1.</p>
        <p>While waiting for a table at the Bloomfield Steak and Seafood House, a young man was conversing with his blind date. Realizing that she knew nothing about politics and even less about the stock market, he ventured on to the subject of dinner. After learning that she adored steak, he proudly announced that he had, indeed, selected the right restaurant --  their steak was comparable to that of Peter Luger's, the renowned steak place in Brooklyn. ''Oh, I know Peter Luger's,'' she said. ''I buy their steak sauce in the supermarket all the time. When did they open a restaurant?''</p>
