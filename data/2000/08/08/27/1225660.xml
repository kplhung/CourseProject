        <p>HAMMERING nails is such an elementary task that it would seem that no explanation is needed. Yet professional carpenters and shop instructors say that many do-it-yourselfers don't know how to drive nails efficiently. The most common mistake is in holding the hammer too close to the head.</p>
        <p>If you only use a hammer for an occasional task, like hanging a picture, then you can use almost any method to get the job done, provided you don't damage the work or hurt yourself. But if an involved construction project requires driving a lot of nails, then proper technique is essential to avoid arm fatigue and mishaps.</p>
        <p>Good nailing technique starts by choosing the right hammer. The claw hammer is the traditional tool because it can be used to pull nails as well as drive them. Until recently, most claw hammers came with wooden handles. A wooden handle has a natural resiliency that absorbs the shock generated when the hammer strikes the nail.</p>
        <p>The main drawback to the wooden handle is that it will split or crack when subjected to a lot of nail pulling. In an effort to produce a more durable handle, tool manufacturers introduced steel-shank hammers. These stand up to strenuous nail pulling, but they have little spring and they can cause arm fatigue. Tubular steel and fiberglass handles are an attempt to combine the best of both materials.</p>
        <p>The handle is only part of the hammer; it is also important to consider the working end of the hammer, the head. Hammerheads are available in weights ranging from 16 to 22 ounces. (Some specialty dealers offer hammers in lighter weights for model makers.) Generally, the 16-ounce head is better for light construction, finishing and repair work. Choose a hammer with the heavier 22-ounce head for framing work.</p>
        <p>The face of the hammer may be either smooth or textured. A smooth face is designed for finish work. If the hammer slips from the nail, the wood will be dented but not scratched. A hammer with a smooth face, however, will often slip off the nail head if the carpenter works too fast.</p>
        <p>Textured faces are designed to grip a nail head even if the hammer doesn't land squarely. There are two types: One is milled (also called a serrated or waffle face). It has a series of parallel grooves cut across the hammer face in a checkerboard pattern. Milled-face hammers are good for driving galvanized nails because the rough face pattern will not rub the galvanized coating off the nails. The main disadvantage to a milled-faced hammer is that it can leave an ugly hammer track if it strikes the wood.</p>
        <p>The second type of textured face is the sandpaper face, which has more grip than a smooth face but won't scar a wood surface.</p>
        <p>Nailing technique consists of tapping the nail lightly to give it a good start in the wood, then swinging the hammer properly to drive the nail home with the least amount of effort. For a large nail, grip the shaft of the nail between the thumb and index finger using the other three fingers to brace the hand. For smaller nails, like roofing nails or brads, it is easier to keep the hand flat, palm up, and grip the nail between the first two fingers. With this approach, the knuckles of the holding hand are out of the way and you have a clear view of the nail.</p>
        <p>When starting the nail, hold the hammer toward the middle of the handle for greater control. Give the nail a few light taps to seat it into the wood, then remove the nail-holding hand. Slide the hand on the hammer toward the end of the handle. This position will give you greater driving force.</p>
        <p>Your hammer grip should be firm. If the handle is slippery and difficult to hold, try roughening it with coarse-grit sandpaper. Some carpenters rub their hammers with pine tar (available at sporting good stores for baseball bats), but too much can make the handle sticky.</p>
        <p>There may be times when you have to start a nail in a hard-to-reach spot. For example, if you are working from a ladder, you have to hold the ladder rung with one hand while starting the nail with the other. You can accomplish this with a special nail-hammer grip. Wrap the fingers around the hammerhead and hold the nail so the head rests against the hammer cheek. Drive the nail into the wood by punching the hammerhead with the heel of the hand.</p>
        <p>Hammering a nail seems relatively simple, but it can be dangerous. A glancing hammer blow can cause nails to become projectiles. Always wear eye protection. Never hold nails in your mouth; the coating on some nails, galvanized or resin compounds, could cause a toxic reaction.</p>
