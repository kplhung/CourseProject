        <p>WHEN the plaque went up on the East Village building saying that it was where Allen Ginsberg once lived, the two young men who now occupy the poet's old apartment had only this to say:</p>
        <p>Who was he?</p>
        <p>Ginsberg, one of the century's most famous writers, and a longtime East Village resident who died in 1997, would probably have found the whole thing pretty funny. (Unless it threw him into absolute despair.)</p>
        <p>The plaque placed this summer by the Historic Landmarks Preservation Center on the building at 170 East Second Street between Avenues A and B notes that Ginsberg lived there from August 1958 until March 1961. It was there, in apartment No. 16, that he wrote ''Kaddish,'' a mournful elegy for his mother, Naomi, that is considered one of his best works.</p>
        <p>The plaque describes Ginsberg as an ''internationally acclaimed poet and member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.'' It doesn't  note that he also celebrated every kind of freedom, behaving outrageously whenever possible, showing up at every be-in, love-in and demonstration imaginable (or in these days, unimaginable) and coming out of the closet before celebrities did that kind of thing.</p>
        <p>The apartment up several flights of stairs in one of those large nondescript East Village walk-ups still looks like the kind of place where Ginsberg would have lived. The first thing you see when you enter is a sink; to the left is the rest of the bathroom. The kitchen is just a wall of the living room. But there are two real bedrooms, each with a window.</p>
        <p>The building has a big sign on the front door saying that many things are not allowed: ball playing, carriages, peddling, or sitting in front of the building Not long ago, this was major drug territory, and landlords had to defend their turf assiduously; now it is being infiltrated by students from New York University, which is steadily expanding its presence to the east of Washington Square Park.</p>
        <p>Noah P. Melnick and Mark Lazaro, both students at N.Y.U., found the apartment a little more than a year ago. Looking for apartments was even worse than they had anticipated; every time they showed up at an available place, it was already taken, or there were 10 people in line in front of them, all wanting it. And so when they found the apartment on Second Street, and realized they were the first people there, they jumped at it. The rent is $2,000 a month. It's not a bargain, says Mr. Lazaro, but ''we're not getting ripped off.''</p>
        <p>THEIR only complaint, really, is noise. ''I like it, but I like to sleep,'' says Mr. Lazaro, who is kept awake late by the sounds of children playing in the street. He is astonished that they stay out so late. ''When I was in high school I couldn't stay out until midnight,'' says Mr. Lazaro, who grew up in Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y. ''And they're 6.''</p>
        <p>They say the neighborhood is changing for the better. When they first arrived, Mr. Melnick says, ''we had to walk two blocks for laundry.'' Now there is a new laundromat across the street. And increasingly people their age are moving into the neighborhood. But it still, he says, has more than its share of people who are ''a little strange.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Melnick and Mr. Lazaro didn't notice the plaque right away. But then one day ''the girl upstairs told us, you live in Allen Ginsberg's apartment,'' Mr. Lazaro said. The name didn't quite ring a bell. ''We're both generally well read,'' said Mr. Melnick. ''We both read lots of poetry. Aristotle, Plato. But Allen Ginsberg -- no.'' They said their landlord asked whether they get any special vibes from the apartment, maybe an urge to write, but they had to confess -- no.</p>
        <p>They haven't yet been tempted to go out and buy one of his books, to see what all the fuss is about. They're probably too busy. Mr. Melnick  works full time at Phoenix Global Investments during the day but also goes to school full time. He leaves the apartment at 6 a.m. and often doesn't  finish work and classes until 11 p.m. As soon as he graduates, he plans to go to law school.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazaro is a finance major and during the summer has been working full time for a hedge fund run by Mario Cibelli. Someday he hopes to have his own hedge fund. And if you don't know what that is, you probably do know who Allen Ginsberg is.</p>
