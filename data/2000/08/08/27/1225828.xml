        <p>Wrapping up a huge international anti-drug operation, the United States has brought the reputed leader of an international cocaine smuggling ring to Florida to face federal charges, the United States Customs Service announced today.</p>
        <p>Along with additional arrests by South American and European authorities, the apprehension of Ivan de la Vega effectively brought to a close one of the broadest international anti-drug operations ever mounted, one that involved authorities from 12 nations, officials said today in Washington.</p>
        <p>A freighter, one of several said to have been used in the global trafficking scheme, is also being confiscated, the officials said.</p>
        <p>''This case demonstrates what can be achieved when nations of the world work together against a common enemy,'' Customs Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said in the statement.</p>
        <p>The smuggling operation was based in Colombia and Venezuela, and Venezuelan officials arrested Mr. de la Vega, a Colombian citizen accused of leading the drug organization, on Aug. 16, as part of a series of raids that used about 200 anti-drug officers with an array of helicopters, airplanes and boats, the authorities said. A United States Navy ship stopped the Maltese-flagged ship, the Suerte I, off the coast of Grenada on Aug. 17 after Venezuelan authorities had intercepted smaller boatloads of cocaine headed to the Suerte I with cocaine on board. No cocaine was found in a search of the larger vessel.</p>
        <p>Also arrested and sent to Florida for prosecution was Luis Antonio Navia, a Cuban national with United States residence status who was a fugitive wanted on prior federal drug charges.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, in Europe, authorities in Greece made eight arrests in connection with shipping firms that they said were linked to the operation. There were also two related arrests in Italy and another in France.</p>
        <p>The American officials said that arrests and seizures effectively wrapped up a two-year, multinational crackdown that resulted in the seizure of nearly 25 tons of cocaine. That much cocaine would have a street value in Europe of roughly $1 billion if sold in individual doses, they said. The drug ring is thought to have transported as much as 68 tons of cocaine to Europe and the United States during the past three years.</p>
