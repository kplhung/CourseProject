        <p>The popular cable show ''Sex and the City'' was recently filmed in the West Village, but residents and merchants say they already have their own version of the program, and they are not happy about it.</p>
        <p>In the last year, three stores selling pornographic material, two of them open 24 hours, have moved on or near a two-block stretch of Christopher Street, bringing the total there to nine.</p>
        <p>''We don't want to become the new version of the old 42nd Street,'' said HelenAnn Lally, the owner of Your Neighborhood Office, an office supply store on Bleecker Street, near Christopher. Ms. Lally began a letter-writing campaign after a store selling pornographic videos opened two doors down on Bleecker last month.</p>
        <p>Sex shops have been in the area for decades. But there have never been as many as there are now, and they are less discreet than in the past, residents say.</p>
        <p>Their appearance on Bleecker is also ominous, said Joan Schechter, executive director of the Greenwich Village Chamber of Commerce. ''I don't think anyone has a problem when it's one or two shops, but when it begins to spread, it's a major issue,'' she said.</p>
        <p>State Senator Thomas K. Duane, who represents the neighborhood, attributed the growth of sex shops to the crackdown on sex-oriented businesses in Times Square, where many stores were forced to close in 1998. ''As we predicted, they were going to move somewhere else, and, as we predicted, the Village would become a prime target,'' Mr. Duane said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Duane, Councilwoman Christine C. Quinn and residents met with representatives of the Mayor's Office of Midtown Enforcement and the police to discuss the issue in a closed meeting earlier this month.</p>
        <p>Gabriel Taussig, an assistant corporation counsel, said the spread of sex shops on Christopher Street was clearly ''not the intent of the legislation, and it's something we are studying to see what can be done to correct the situation.''</p>
        <p>Sunset Park in Brooklyn has experienced a similar influx since the crackdown on the Times Square sex market.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lally says the only way to stop the shops is to persuade landlords not to rent to them. But landlords have found it hard to resist the high rents that sex shops are willing to pay.</p>
        <p>At one shop at Hudson and Christopher Streets, customers pay $10 to watch ''Non-Sexual Amateur Wrestling and Exercise Videos'' in a dark back room. (City regulations require 60 percent of a shop's merchandise to be ''nonadult.'')</p>
        <p>''Some people are turned on by that,'' the man behind the counter said with a shrug.</p>
