        <p>WHEN Guadalupe Loaeza hears her country's next president urging a more open border between the United States and Mexico, her heart floods with  contradictory emotions.</p>
        <p>In struggling to describe the inner tug-of-war, Ms. Loaeza, a successful writer, talks about the many times she has driven across the divide between Tijuana and San Diego. It's a journey that starts with the fear of being assaulted by the gangs of thieves known to prowl the area; the aggravation of waiting in smog-choked lines of cars, with street vendors banging on the windows hawking statuettes of the Virgin of Guadalupe in one hand and a Mickey Mouse doll in the other; the depressing signs of poverty.</p>

        <p>WHEN Guadalupe Loaeza hears her country's next president urging a more open border between the United States and Mexico, her heart floods with  contradictory emotions.</p>
        <p>In struggling to describe the inner tug-of-war, Ms. Loaeza, a successful writer, talks about the many times she has driven across the divide between Tijuana and San Diego. It's a journey that starts with the fear of being assaulted by the gangs of thieves known to prowl the area; the aggravation of waiting in smog-choked lines of cars, with street vendors banging on the windows hawking statuettes of the Virgin of Guadalupe in one hand and a Mickey Mouse doll in the other; the depressing signs of poverty.</p>
        <p>Once on the United States side, she says, the sun literally seems to shine brighter, and her head fills with game-show tunes. She gorges herself on shopping in fine department stores. Then she plops herself at the best table at the city's best seafood restaurant and orders the biggest lobster she can get.</p>
        <p>Inevitably, she said, her waiter is Mexican. The busboys and dishwashers are, too. She scrunches her Saks Fifth Avenue bags out of sight as feelings of shame and sadness sweep over her once again.</p>
        <p>''The border is a very painful place for me because it reminds me of all that Mexico has been unable to achieve,'' she said. ''Driving from one side to the other, in a space that is geographically only a few miles wide, you feel as though you have traveled between two different worlds. And for me it is very painful that the world where there is most of the misery and poverty and corruption is Mexico.''</p>
        <p>Last week, when Vicente Fox Quesada paid his first visit to Washington as Mexico's president-elect  and informally presented his ideas for a more liberal northward flow of Mexican workers, he was speaking to a country that sees its southern border mostly as a pathetically inadequate barrier, one that fails to keep out drugs, crime and the tidal wave of some 150,000 undocumented Mexicans each year.</p>
        <p>But for Mexicans, the proposals have stirred a flurry of mixed emotions. Among the poor, whose sons and husbands are the most likely to venture illegally across the border in search of decent wages, Mr. Fox's proposals have raised hopes that they might soon be able to cross safely and with dignity.</p>
        <p>For the middle classes, an opening of the border seems more a necessary evil. To them, the border is the epicenter of Mexico's love-hate relationship with the United States. Because the border is the gateway to the most powerful country in the world, it is at once mythical and a place where Mexico's disadvantages are magnified.</p>
        <p>Jorge Calderon, a 21-year-old college student from the state of Guanajuato, said that migration to the United States dominates its culture. Guanajuato is the home of Mr. Fox and has the nation's third highest rate of migration to the United States.</p>
        <p>''Around here,'' Mr. Calderon groaned, ''children do not talk about growing up to become doctors or lawyers. They grow up planning to go to the United States.''</p>
        <p>Homero Aridjis, a well-known poet, grew up in Michoacan, a state that also has a high rate of migration north. He never felt drawn to the border as a boy, he said. And feels less so as a man.</p>
        <p>He doesn't even see the border region as truly Mexican.</p>
        <p>''Whenever I go there I feel ashamed,'' he said. ''I wonder, why is it Mexico has to have such a hideous border, full of people trying to get bribes, full of environmental problems, full of poverty? It's the place where all of the negative parts of Mexico thrive best.''</p>
        <p>Primitivo Rodriguez, a political analyst, had a more optimistic view. The border, he said, has become an engine of new prosperity in the wake of the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement. Border cities, thanks to the American-owned factories called maquiladoras, have Mexico's lowest unemployment rates and access to rare goods and services.</p>
        <p>What some Mexicans consider an insufferable invasion of all things American into Mexican border cities -- where radio stations play more rock-and-roll than rancheros  and people eat flour tortillas rather than corn -- Mr. Rodriguez considers a dynamic cultural exchange.</p>
        <p>''I see the border as sort of a great line of defense of Mexican culture,'' he said. ''It is easy to speak Spanish and sing the Mexican national anthem when you are in Chiapas or Mexico City. But when you hear the anthem in Tijuana or when someone shouts 'Viva Mexico,' in the streets of Ciudad Juarez, it has much deeper meaning.</p>
        <p>''It's a Mexican way of saying to America, 'I may have to listen to your music. I may have to learn to speak English. I may even have to work for you. But don't ever forget I am a Mexican.''</p>
        <p>''Drug trafficking and illegal immigration has given the border a bad image here and in the United States,'' he said. ''But cities like Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez are the fastest-growing cultural and economic centers of the country.</p>
