&lt;br&gt;George W. Bush claims Al Gore is campaigning on the issue of class warfare, and of course he is right. What Mr. Bush doesn't mention is that he's running on class warfare, too -- but the classes are different. For Mr. Gore, it's rich vs. ''working families,'' and he's against the rich. For Mr. Bush, the war is between the meritocracy and everyone else, and he's against the meritocracy.
&lt;p&gt;
 Each candidate is on the right side to win, depending on which war is really being fought -- or, more accurately, on which war most the voters would rather win.

      <abstract>
        <p>David Lebedoff Op-Ed article says Vice Pres Al Gore could lose the 'class war' with Gov George W Bush if voters come to see Gore as the candidate of the meritocracy, the new elite that believes it should run things because it excels in pure reason, and Bush as candidate of the majority, which resents the new elite and prizes other values more dearly than reasoning skills, including tradition, constancy, patience, resolve, tolerance, dispassion, compassion, courage, good humor, humility and faith; cartoon (M)</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>If it is an economic class war, Mr. Gore has a chance of victory. There is a widespread perception of the growing disparity in wealth, and no one disputes that the tax cut Mr. Bush proposes would greatly benefit the very rich. But a more immediate question is how to keep the good times rolling, and Mr. Bush would claim that the credit for them lies elsewhere than with the Clinton-Gore administration, and that he is the true champion of working families.</p>
        <p>The economic battle for the presidency could go either way. And that brings us to the other battle, the one that Mr. Bush expects to win: the war against the meritocracy.</p>
        <p>This is a war over what kind of people should be in charge, and it has been raging for decades. To some extent it's a values war.</p>
        <p>Beginning with the G.I. Bill, college has depended increasingly more on measurable scholastic ability than on the status of wealth or birth.  The good schools, and afterward the good jobs, public and private, have been going to those with the highest grades and SAT scores. The trend accelerated in the 1960's, as federal scholarships and loans and needs-based financial aid further widened the college applicant pool. It is widely assumed that Mr. Bush could not get into Yale today but that Mr. Gore would have a shot at being admitted to Harvard.</p>
        <p>So what's the matter with merit? Absolutely nothing -- assuming that merit can be measured. But what if it can't? Do good college grades tell us who is better at life in its wider scope, and not just college courses? Do they tell us who would be a better president?</p>
        <p>The meritocracy thinks that they  do. This isn't just conceit. People are naturally grateful to the source of their success. To a businessman, it's the free market. To Prince Charles, it's the monarchy. To millions of Americans holding better jobs than their parents ever dreamed of, it's the school work or the SAT. Only that's not what they think. They all think it's merit.</p>
        <p>The problem with the meritocracy is that it believes it's certifiably better at everything. It has demonstrated a proficiency at reasoning skills, and therefore thinks every problem can be solved entirely with that proficiency. If this were indeed correct, then Herbert Hoover would have been a better president than Franklin Roosevelt, and Jimmy Carter would have ranked higher than Ronald Reagan.</p>
        <p>Another problem with the meritocracy is that it doesn't really believe in majority rule, because if we already know who the smartest people are, why should we bother to solicit the opinion of anyone else?</p>
        <p>This has caused, not consciously but very, very pervasively, a restructuring of our institutions to avoid the will of the electorate. The classic example is Hillary Clinton's plan to overhaul health care, devised away from the public debate, in rooms full of policy experts. Increasingly, too, major decisions are made by judges and administrators virtually immune from electoral reproach, let alone removal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush is hoping that the backlash against this elitist approach is focused on Mr. Gore. To be seen primarily as a wonk is fatal to a candidate today. Mr. Clinton flew under the voter radar because he was a Southern governor who had the good old boy thing down perfectly.</p>
        <p>Not that Mr. Bush is really the Midland, Tex., scamp whose drawl can make Lyndon Johnson sound like Dean Acheson. He's the descendant of gentry, the Democrats continually point out, while Mr. Gore is in fact the son of parents who worked their way out of poverty in the South.</p>
        <p>So why does this war favor Mr. Bush? Because the voters are so alienated by the effect of the meritocracy on the very concept of consent of the governed that our elections have been transformed. Campaigns are framed to be less about issues than about the candidate's background and outlook. If a presidential candidate is seen as primarily a member of the meritocracy, the voters seem to push the other lever, even if it means tax cuts for the rich.</p>
        <p>Values play into this war. A candidate whose principal faith is in pure reason, rather than experience, frightens most voters. As an alternative, they look for someone guided by values: tradition, constancy, patience, resolve, tolerance, dispassion, compassion, courage, good humor, humility, faith.</p>
        <p>Faith is a good example.  If you believe in God and religious tenets, you possess values other than total reliance on the power of intellect. That's why this campaign has been marked on both sides by more protestations of faith than were ever provoked by Torquemada.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore is very vulnerable in any contest decided by resentment of the meritocracy. In two interviews in The New Yorker, his statements are almost impossible to read -- tortured self-analytical psychobabble and social science prose. These are potentially more damaging than Mr. Bush's gaffes -- since a lack of expertise probably plays better than excessive expertise.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush would do well to reproduce millions of copies of the Gore interviews and drop them from planes over every swing state. The economic class war being played out in this election could go either way; the new elite class war, only one.</p>
