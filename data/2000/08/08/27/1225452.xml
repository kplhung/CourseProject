        <p>If you want to talk seriously about the painter Bridget Riley, then let's dispose of Twiggy and Mary Quant and the whole 60's Op Art craze. Thirty-five years ago, Riley was the That Girl of contemporary painting.

        <p>But some kinds of success are deadly, or at least they could be in the days before celebrity at any price was considered the same as ambition. In February 1965, Riley was in a car on her way from the airport to the Museum of Modern Art, where she was one of the stars of a big multi-artist survey. As she drove up Madison Avenue, she saw -- in one store window after another -- dresses by a variety of makers whose designs were lifted from her paintings. ''The whole thing had spread everywhere even before I touched down at the airport,'' she recalled years later. She was horrified and tried to sue -- never mind that the dresses looked awful. Fame turned to fad. The show was a mess. Americans lumped her with artists whose paintings were one-note eye-teasing stunts. Op enjoyed its 15 minutes as a gimmick hitched to psychedelia, Carnaby Street and groovy wallpaper before dropping into oblivion. ''It will take at least 20 years before anyone looks at my paintings seriously again,'' Riley predicted.</p>
        <p>She was wrong. It took more than 30, in America at least. But now abstract art is accepted in art's inner circles again. Female artists who decline, as Riley did, to be ''women artists'' have a following among young postfeminists. The art of the 60's is being mined, and Riley has become a touchstone to an eclectic generation that includes Damien Hirst, Diana Thater, Julian Opie and Rachel Whiteread. Even if they don't relate to her old-style Modernist ideals for pure abstraction, they can't help acknowledging her intelligence, style, perseverance and moral rectitude, which manifests itself in the astringency of her art. Besides, the work looks great.</p>
        <p>The change has been rapid. Two years ago, a modest overview of her career, in the out-of-the-way Lake District, got raves in the London papers. Then last year, a London exhibition of her 60's and 70's pictures at the Serpentine Gallery surprised even her, attracting 130,000 people, the most ever for a show there, with lines literally out the door. Now, the Dia Center in New York is opening a show next month of her pre-1984 work, while the PaceWildenstein Gallery surveys her work since the early 80's and presents a group of 60's drawings. At 69, Riley is finally receiving her long-deserved second look.</p>
        <p>She and I have met before, several times, but now that i have told her I want to write about her, it turns out to be surprisingly hard to arrange. Along with having been burned in print, she, more than almost any artist, can't stand the business of selling herself. On the day we had fixed to get together, she has flown to Zurich to see a Cezanne show with a friend.</p>
        <p>A day later, she returns, smiling, solicitous. She has a way of seeming slightly reserved and also looking very hard at you. Hair cropped and tousled, in shirt and jeans, she keeps a workingman's appearance: straight, tough, no-nonsense. She is formidable and charming, with a gritty, jaunty voice. During the Thatcher years, she became a trustee of the National Gallery in London and single-handedly stopped her colleagues from blithely giving away property the gallery owned on Trafalgar Square to a developer, by leaking the story to The Observer after those other trustees ignored her repeated protests. The ultimate outcome was an extension to the museum, the Sainsbury Wing, that has been one of the major improvements to art in England in years. Only fools take Riley lightly.</p>
        <p>Her character was focused during childhood. A distant descendant of Gladstone, she was born in 1931 in London to a family she describes as ''not badly off but not wealthy, either.'' She spent the war in a primitive cottage near the coast in Cornwall with her mother, sister and aunt, a household of women. Her aunt had studied art. Her mother, the daughter of an English inventor who worked for Thomas Edison, lived on Park Avenue and made and lost several fortunes, was ''very visually aware,'' she says. During the war years, Riley spent hours with her mother and aunt walking the countryside in Cornwall. Talking about different light effects and the intricate characteristics of trees and water and plants was one way of not focusing on the anxiety of her father's absence: Riley's father, a British soldier captured by the Japanese in 1941, survived forced labor on the Siamese railway but, like many war prisoners, took a while to readapt to family life. ''He had learned to live in a self-contained way, to isolate himself from what was around him,'' she says.</p>
        <p>''Phenomena hunting,'' as she has called her intense encounters with nature, became for her a form of constructive distraction. To look very closely at a certain thing, after all, means you are also looking away from something else. This is one way, at least, of explaining what separates her work from shallow, gimmicky Op and gives it its intensity. Her abstract patterns, mesmerizing, are similarly expressions of psychological displacement. Their eye-riveting quality makes them like self-contained and beneficent universes, independent from, and overwhelming of, what's around them.</p>
        <p>Riley speaks cautiously, never dissembles, likes to spar. Educated partly at home, she went on to Cheltenham Ladies' College, the most snobbish of English girls' preparatory schools, and then to Goldsmiths' College, where she learned to draw from life. In 1952, she enrolled at the Royal College of Art, where she studied for three frustrating years, getting no guidance from the old-fashioned faculty, knowing that she wanted to be a painter but not knowing what kind of painter. She had her first real look at the London art scene -- small, male, conservative and insular -- which appalled her. Then in 1955, just after she graduated from art school, her father was nearly killed in a car accident. Her parents resettled in London, where it was easier for him to get around, in the Kensington town house that Riley now occupies. Riley helped nurse her father for a year, and the combined stress of that commitment and trying to become a painter caused a nervous breakdown. Briefly hospitalized, she fell into a job at the J. Walter Thompson ad agency. She was adrift.</p>
        <p>Then, in 1958, she went to a Pollock show in London that, she says, ''made a very powerful impact on me because it became clear that modern art was alive and I had something to react to.'' The next year, she began an intense relationship with Maurice de Sausmarez, an older painter and innovative teacher whose deep interests in Klee, Cezanne and Seurat stimulated her to look harder at them. But it was the breakup with de Sausmarez that caused the real advance in her work. As it had with her absent father, art became a way of dealing with loss. She has cited Proust's remark to the effect that you find what you love only by first giving it up. ''I wrongly attached to this person, who knew a lot more than me, everything that I had experienced with him, which was the history of art in the 20th century, and childishly I figured when I'd lost him, I'd lost that,'' she says. ''I decided to paint one last painting, entirely black. But even then there was a small voice still in me, which looked at the painting and said: 'This doesn't express anything. What's wrong?' It had no contrast. So I put in white. I decided on two black shapes, one with a curve, the other with a straight line, opposites, nearly touching, but not touching, the white spaces between them making almost a flash of light. That was 'Kiss.' It seemed good. And so I told myself, 'O.K., just one more painting.' I was off.''</p>
        <p>''Kiss'' led to the early black-and-white Op works, like ''Movement in Squares'' (1961), a flat checkerboard that seems to collapse or fold into depth. A story Riley often tells, so much so that she is tired of it by now, is about being in Italy in 1960 and becoming transfixed when a squall obscured the black-and-white marble pattern of the paving in a piazza. She determined to figure out how to capture this effect of momentary disturbance, and also her emotion at seeing it -- not to paint an abstract landscape but to provoke the mix of pleasure and unease she felt, to stimulate a kind of existential alertness.</p>
        <p>The same year, Riley got another serendipitous boost. Still working part time at the ad agency, she was dodging a downpour on the way home from the office one day and dashed into a doorway that happened to be the entrance to an art gallery. The director invited her in, offered to look at her paintings and soon afterward gave her her first solo show. It was a huge success. Riley's art was something English art hadn't produced before: electric, bold abstraction. ''We have to submit to the attack in the way we have to learn to enjoy a cold shower,'' the perceptual psychologist Anton Ehrenzweig wrote, capturing the work's initial impact. ''There comes a voluptuous moment when the senses and the whole skin tingle with a sharpened awareness of the body and the world around.''</p>
        <p>That first show was in 1961. Three years later, her fame at its peak, came the dress fiasco in New York, and Riley retreated to London. The Dia show is the first museum exhibition in New York since the Modern's survey, 35 years ago.</p>
        <p>While I waited for Riley to come back from Zurich, I spent the day with Andrew Smith, her assistant, a wry, stolid, self-effacing man of 51, a landscape painter who has been working for Riley for 29 years. Her other assistant, Maria Timperi, a half-Finnish, half-Ethiopian woman, 40, has been with her for a decade and is herself a figurative painter. Riley has had abstract artists as assistants, but she told me that they sometimes confused her work with theirs, ''a terrible, painful tangle for all concerned.''</p>
        <p>Smith showed me around Riley's six-story all-white Kensington house. The two peeling strips of old masking tape forming the number on her front door give away that this is an artist's place. A small kitchen overlooks an overgrown backyard. Sun pours in.</p>
        <p>Four of the six stories are studios that Riley uses for different purposes. The place is clean, efficient, unpretentious. Riley also has houses with studios in Cornwall and Provence. And she has a studio in Bow in the East End, a loft, with adjacent apartments she uses for storage. The building, built in the 1920's, used to be a church community center. It is near a highway and housing projects. The East End is where fashionable galleries settle these days, but Riley's loft is in an area still depressed and off the beaten track, which seems right for someone who has always stuck very much to herself. The loft, almost an hour from her house by tube, is a shoebox with 18-foot ceilings, white and blue, with odds and ends of mismatched furniture and a galley kitchen: functional, slightly shabby. I noticed a lonely package of spaghetti and two old tomatoes in a bowl on the kitchen counter. ''A single person's life,'' Smith commented. Riley's life is her work. She has never married. She has no children.</p>
        <p>A few of Riley's latest pictures are here: vividly colored multipanel paintings of large, swooping, slanting curves that can bring to mind Matisse's late cutouts. She has worked constantly over the years, evolving one style out of another, each style posing problems that the next addresses, not toward some goal but in a back-and-forth, open-ended way. ''The challenge,'' as she has put it, ''is to find a way of working that creates dialogue, resistance, so that you do something and then change it -- not to reach an end but so that everything stays alive and has its consequences.''</p>
        <p>In the mid-60's she realized that the effects she achieved in black and white already implied colors, as black and white can do. From simple patterned stripes in basic colors like red and blue, she moved to more complex wavy lines in several colors, which she found overrefined, so she reverted (we're up to the early 80's now) to stripes. This time, she used a restricted palette influenced by a trip she made to Egypt, where she was struck by how the ancient Egyptians, using just a few colors, had conveyed the effect of what she has called the ''light-mirroring desert.''</p>
        <p>The stripes gave way a second time to a more complicated arrangement, this time of verticals and diagonals or stripes and parallelograms. These yielded a few years ago to the recent works, still based on the underlying architecture of the stripes and diagonals but now resulting in curvaceous, shimmering but less dizzying planes of interlocking colors.</p>
        <p>Riley has always hated when people say her works are hard on the eyes or create optical illusions, because that's not her point, and because it implies that they're just tricks -- once seen, no longer interesting. As she has said, ''Illusion used in that sense is a kind of cheat or deceit.'' But even so, her art can be tough to look at at first. Then the eye adjusts. Space gradually opens up. With a classic stripe painting like ''Apr s-Midi'' (1981), the stripes seem magically to unfold, like an accordion, into depth. Black stripes anchor an illusory middle ground, breaking up the image, which a viewer reads instinctively from left to right, at irregular intervals. The effect is syncopated. No wonder Riley relates her art to music.</p>
        <p>The colors are also peculiar to Riley, curious in-between hues, which she manages, as Matisse and Mondrian did, to put together in ways that make them look more vibrant than they are. Discomfort gives way to stability, disjunction to coherence, paradox being a theme in Riley's art. The best works have an intense formal density and logic. This is about as good as traditional abstract painting gets these days.</p>
        <p>The two most obvious qualities of Riley's art, like her life, are control and self-denial, so it's another kind of paradox that she and her work end up being essentially optimistic. When she was searching around in the late 50's for a way to paint, she was influenced by Seurat, not because of the pseudoscience behind his colored dots (Riley's art, organizationally improvisatory and empirical, has never had to do with optical science or math or eye-brain exercises, contrary to what many people assume), but because she liked that Seurat had developed a method, a system of perception, that resulted from self-imposed limits.</p>
        <p>Using assistants to paint for her is clearly one way she has limited herself. Since the early 60's, assistants have carried out her pictures based on her preparatory drawings or, in recent years, on the works she has pasted together with colored papers on penciled grids. This is an updated version of the way artists have run their studios for centuries, notwithstanding that her secondhand approach is now being called postmodern, something she finds equally amusing and strange.</p>
        <p>''My goal was to make the image perfect, not mechanical -- I was not one of those artists -- but perfect in the sense of being exactly as I had intended it,'' she says. ''I didn't want it to be about gesture.'' She was reacting against Abstract Expressionism, much the way American Minimalists and so-called Post-Painterly Abstractionists were reacting at the time. Then suddenly, answering an unasked question about the assistants, she adds: ''Yes, I do miss painting sometimes. But there are lots of things you must give up in life.''</p>
        <p>It isn't quite true that riley dropped off the map after Op went the way of the Hula-Hoop. America, nationalistically myopic, mostly stopped paying attention, but a steady clientele in Europe and Japan, and a few loyal Americans, bought everything she was willing to sell through the mid-70's. She remained a formidable presence in English art. In 1968, she was the first woman to win the painting prize at the Venice Biennale, where she represented Great Britain, a huge honor at the time.</p>
        <p>Still, it was becoming more difficult for her as the years went by. She was never a joiner. The so-called London School of figurative painters, men like Bacon, Freud and R.B. Kitaj, was becoming increasingly identified internationally with contemporary English art. Being an attractive woman was a burden, not a help. When Lord Snowdon posed Riley shoeless, glancing sideways at the camera, the picture became famous but, she now thinks, cost her slightly too. ''Women artists didn't know how to present themselves in photographs then,'' she says. ''I didn't know enough to say no when he asked me to take off my shoes.''</p>
        <p>This is something Riley would never have discussed or even allowed to come up until lately. She never wanted to be known as a female artist. She was an abstract painter, that was it, and only reluctantly has she come to accept that a younger generation of women, many of whom aren't abstract painters, embrace her for being a woman who stuck to her guns and stood toe to toe with the boys. ''In a way, I was protected by being a woman,'' she acknowledges. ''I was granted independence, freedom, and I didn't have to get involved in the ambitions and problems that involved other artists. And I've always managed to support myself and my assistants from my work, even during the bad years, partly because I'm happy with my old chairs and tables, and despite the studios, I live frugally. Besides, I never wanted to turn myself into a travesty of femininity. I thought my femininity shouldn't be an issue, but neither was I going to make a fetish of it not being an issue. In this sense, I agree completely with the young women today.''</p>
        <p>In the early 90's, you could buy a classic 60's Riley drawing at Christie's East in New York for $1,500 and a 60's painting for $20,000. Now the comparative prices are up to $30,000 and $400,000. The funny thing about Riley's up-and-down status is that it has always involved some degree of misunderstanding. In the 60's, it was that she had to do with Jean Shrimpton and Op underwear. Now, it's postfeminism, postmodernism and 60's retro chic. Still, Cezanne would probably have thought the Cubists who emulated him were crazy. ''I don't want to get in rows or interfere,'' Riley says, admitting that an artist can't control the reception of her work. But, being famously outspoken, she then can't help adding that ''at the moment we are in the midst of a rather big wave of philistinism.'' She says abstraction is still the universal promise of the modern age, what Christian imagery used to be: a ''potentially very powerful answer to this spiritual challenge of an unavailable truth, a means of expression beyond limits.''</p>
        <p>Not long ago, she wrote about the American sculptor and video artist Bruce Nauman, someone almost nobody would associate with her. She stressed the formal qualities of the work, admiring its intelligence. It was a reminder that she remains very much an independent woman, as unpredictable as her career. When the new Tate Modern opened in the spring, it devoted a room to Riley, another clear sign of changed times.</p>
        <p>''Fashion always plays a part in the art world, but when it gets the upper hand it spells a vacuum,'' she says. ''During the periods of neglect, I was free to work without interruptions or distractions. I have never wanted celebrity, but I do want recognition, fair and just, not praise. I believe the work will communicate. We'll see. I am getting older.''</p>
