        <p>HORROR vacui -- fear of emptiness -- is the driving force in contemporary American taste.  Along with the commercial interests that exploit this fear, it is the major factor now shaping attitudes toward public spaces, urban centers and even suburban sprawl.</p>
        <p>Every public space must be packed with distractions. Food and flower vendors, musicians, banners, fountains, benches and plants must fill every mid-block plaza. They must be packed with young urban professionals, picturesquely enjoying wrap sandwiches and bottles of Evian water. Otherwise, it is a failure. Periodically, photographs of empty spaces will be published.  Captions will say: these are failures.</p>
        <p>Streets are too empty. They must have more billboards, public art or distinctive street furniture. Trees are too empty. They must be hung with Christmas lights or signs identifying their species. Train stations and airports are too empty. They must become so-called destination places or be, in professional parlance, packed with program -- specialty shops for chocolates, sunglasses, lingerie and watches, along with eating spots featuring Mexican, New England, Deli and Healthy cuisine.</p>
        <p>Suburban lawns are too empty. Houses must be built on smaller lots. They must be filled up with the latest weed killers and lined with free-form planting beds that are themselves filled with bags of redwood chips. Iced tea is too empty. It must be lightly laced with mango juice or it cannot be enjoyed. Water is too empty. It must come flavored with orange, lime or wild cherry. This whole package is called The New Urbanism.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the time has come to change the criteria for measuring success. Emptiness may not be a quality to be feared. Perhaps the Japanese are not the only people with the capacity to appreciate the quality of a void. After all, there is often little difference between a failed American public space and a Zen garden. Why shouldn't we, too, learn to recognize the value of hollowness?</p>
        <p>Recently I have been revisiting Michelangelo Antonioni's classic movies of the early 1960's -- ''L'Avventura,'' ''La Notte,'' ''L'Eclisse'' and ''Red Desert.'' As much portraits of places as they are essays in plot and character, they have lost none of their power to convey fragmented social relationships and the oblique urban environments in which human affairs unfold. Existential film noirss, these movies portray a kind of space that remains useful in the present moment of urban transformation: space noir.  Emptiness is its essential quality.</p>
        <p>I find ''L'Eclisse'' the most haunting.  Monica Vitti and Alain Delon hold the screen by virtue of their physical beauty, but the entire movie seems like one big build-up to the final scene, in which the two actors pointedly fail to appear. They have made desultory plans to meet at ''the usual place,'' a highway intersection on the outskirts of Rome. Vitti lives nearby, in a modern flat.</p>
        <p>Throughout the movie, the director contrasts this antiseptic, postwar environment with the medieval streets of the historic center. But he betrays no sentimental attachment to the ancient city. Frank Lloyd Wright once condemned cities as places for ''mutual assignations and assassinations.'' That is roughly what Antonioni shows us, too. Stock brokers slaughtering each other on the floor of the Borsa. Lovers seducing and rejecting one another all over town.</p>
        <p>In town, these passions are softened by the cafes, newsstands, dim palazzo interiors, narrow streets, the weathered masonry of the buildings lining them and other furniture from the attic of Old World charm. In the modern outskirts, we still get the assignations and assassinations, but we get them pure, without the comforting distractations.  Instead, the passive-aggression of phone calls and traffic transpires amid the abstract geometry of the postwar utopia.</p>
        <p>When new, Antonioni's movies were received in fairly one-dimensional terms.  They were thought to depict the malaise of the modern world. The fragmented cityscapes and industrial wastelands were even seen as causes of the sickness. In retrospect, the disaffection of Antonioni's characters looks like a human condition, not merely a modern one. There is no malaise, no need for a cure. There is only an emotional reality to be confronted. And with what elegance, what style, Antonioni's characters face it!  Such exquisite doubt, such refined anxiety.  What an artistic gesture of refusal the pair make by not showing up -- not venturing to disturb the noir composition of street lights and headlamps blinking on at dusk.</p>
        <p>Antonioni's cinematography was once criticized for being too beautiful for his existential subject matter. Today, the beauty holds the meaning. From an urban point of view, his movies are premonitory fables.  They anticipate the conversion of the rusting, postindustrial metropolis into the increasingly aestheticized city of art.</p>
        <p>The desire to see these movies again, after nearly 40 years, was aroused by a group of projects that represent the most recent phase of this conversion. I refer to the art parks or culture districts now taking shape in Pittsburgh, downtown Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Newark, Charleston and other cities nationwide. In New York, two such projects are under way. In Brooklyn, an art zone is now being planned for the area surrounding the Brooklyn Academy of Music.  In Manhattan, architects are now submitting bids for the redevelopment of the buildings and open spaces at Lincoln Center, the grandparent of all performing arts centers.  These projects offer an opportunity to rethink the criteria by which the success of public spaces is to be judged.</p>
        <p>Many enlightened people helped shape the standards currently in use. They include Jane Jacobs, William H. Whyte, Benjamin J. Thompson, Kevin Lynch, Edward Logue and James Rouse. Thompson is the undersung figure of the group, though he was the visionary who first conceived what would later be called the festival marketplace.  Thompson was a young partner in the Architects Collaborative, a Cambridge, Mass., firm established by Walter Gropius. Later, he succeeded Gropius as dean of Harvard's Graduate School of Design. Despite his modernist pedigree, Thompson recognized that the modern vision of the city was flawed. In the era of suburban exodus, the urban core was not sufficiently alluring to attract people after work hours.</p>
        <p>Like Rem Koolhaas decades later, Thompson recognized the potential of shopping to animate inert urban space. In the 1960's, Thompson created the first of a chain of retail establishments, called Design Research, that specialized in modern furniture and accessories for the home. He also owned a restaurant in Harvard Square. Faneuil Hall, the first of the Rouse-Thompson collaborations, opened in 1976. With it, the new retail-populist paradigm was launched.</p>
        <p>When creative responses become formulaic, they can stifle creativity later on. Thompson's vision has suffered this fate.  The festival marketplace remains a useful concept for orchestrating certain kinds of urban space. But its very success created new problems in turn. For one thing, it displaced urban diversity with a homogenized atmosphere of chain stores, coordinated street furniture, banners and signs. As a controlled, commercial environment, it eroded the distinction between the open urban environment and such suburban places as like the shopping mall, the theme park and the residential enclave. Consumerism, when working properly, should increase access to the public realm. When applied to public urban space, it raises invisible, exclusionary barriers.</p>
        <p>That's one reason why modern architecture's failed public spaces are looking quite good these days.  There's no pressure to spend $2 for a cookie. A stroll across Chase Manhattan Plaza, in lower Manhattan, offers a refreshing vacation from distractions. You're in the heart of a huge bank, but there are no commercial interruptions. The emptiness is ideal for sorting out inner and outer worlds. It's a democratic space, too.  Democratic and popular are not, after all, synonyms. There are moments, in fact, when the two concepts are at odds. A city that offers the alternative of unpopular spaces is more accessible than a city that only tolerates popular success.</p>
        <p>AND I wonder if failed space isn't more conducive to creativity. This may be a romantic notion, but it's also a classical idea. Think of Goethe pondering Roman ruins. Postindustrial cities that are seeking to remake themselves as cultural centers might also benefit from pondering the success of failure: the glamour of their own collapse.</p>
        <p>The aura of failure: this is what I find appealing about the outdoor lighting system designed by Richard Gluckman and Robert Wilson for the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, a 16-block performing arts district now being realized in downtown Pittsburgh. Using theatrical scrims, natural light and artificial illumination, Gluckman and Wilson have woven a discontinuous maze through the districts back alleys. The lighting effects, a changing blend of blue, green and white, have the phosphorescence of decay.</p>
        <p>The project serves a practical function. It's supposed to reassure culture consumers that muggers and junkies aren't lurking in the alleys.  But instead of going merry and festive, the lighting has a consumptive pallor. Gluckman designed Pittsburgh's Andy Warhol Museum, and the noir spaces he designed with Wilson are strikingly Warholian.  Particularly as presented serially in renderings (as it appears in a new monograph on Gluckman's work), the design evokes Warhol's Shadow paintings of the late 1970's. The lighting seems to shimmer between the pop extremes of obscurity and fame.  The light will make your skin look as bad as Andy's.</p>
        <p>Emptiness, obscurity, failure, bleakness, pallor -- such noir terms are not found in the vocabulary of civic success with which urban revitalization programs are typically promoted. But these terms should be permissible wherever culture comes up. Even an artist like Warhol, with all that diamond dust in his eyes, knew that too much glitter is unhealthy for art.</p>
