        <p>International Paper, the world's largest producer of paper products, will move its corporate headquarters from Purchase to a 15-story building in downtown Stamford, which it obtained when it acquired Champion International, a rival paper producer, in late June. The company has 120 workers at its Purchase offices.</p>
        <p>International Paper plans to sell the building in Stamford and lease back several floors.</p>
        <p>The Empire State Development Corporation said it offered a package of incentives but was trumped by Connecticut's offer of a no-interest $1 million loan for building renovation, a sales tax exemption on construction work and a $5.2 million loan to rewire the building for communications.</p>
