        <p>Tananarive Due's graceful historical novel, THE BLACK ROSE (Ballantine, $25.95), traces the life of Madame C. J. Walker (1867-1919), nee Sarah Breedlove, a penniless girl from Delta, La., who became America's first black female millionaire. This book is based on research and an outline left behind by Alex Haley, who planned to write a novel about Walker; Due, a former columnist for The Miami Herald and the author of two previous novels, has taken the material and made it her own. Walker was orphaned at 6, married at 14 and was widowed a few years later; she was a washerwoman and cook until, in her late 30's, she married a Denver businessman named Charles Walker in 1906. By her death at the age of 51 she was, after starting her own hair care company, extraordinarily wealthy. Sarah's business began with experiments to treat her own hair loss and itchy scalp; thanks to word-of-mouth advertising, the company flourished and eventually employed some 20,000 ''Walker agents'' throughout the country. No retiring mogul, Walker financed a mission school in Africa, stumped for the N.A.A.C.P., sued a movie theater for charging blacks higher ticket prices than whites and built an Italian Renaissance-style palace in upstate New York as her home and as her ''monument to Negro achievement.'' Due's book resists becoming a facile Horatio Alger story: We follow the estrangement between Sarah and her daughter, and watch as Sarah courts the man who would become her second husband, despite our suspicion that he might be a poor companion. ''Maybe when you've lost as much as me, you don't take happy for granted,'' Sarah says. ''You scrape and hoard every piece of happy that comes your way.''</p>
