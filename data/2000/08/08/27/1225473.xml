        <p>I WAS drunk the first time I danced flamenco, which helped considerably. It was 15 years ago, and I had recently arrived in southern Spain, one of 30 or so American college girls well primed for the modest adventure of a junior year abroad. It was October, and the heat that turns the streets of Cordoba to molten tar had only recently subsided, so that we were just beginning to recognize the beauty of that city's winding alleyways and flowering balconies. We would walk the mile to school each day in small, chattering groups, past shopkeepers who did not yet know our names but who recognized us for what we were: that year's crop of americanas.</p>
        <p>It happened at the first party of the year. There are no fraternities on Spanish campuses, but new students nevertheless undergo a hazing called a novatada. For a month they are subjected to all the humiliation the upperclassmen can heap upon them, forced to sing in the dining hall, wear their ears painted red for days on end, make their superiors' beds each morning. One medical student I knew was outfitted in only a diaper and papier-mache wings, and hung for hours, putto-style, from the entryway to the university. At the end of this period of ritual humiliation, the novatos are welcomed into the community with a full-fledged bash.</p>

        <p>I WAS drunk the first time I danced flamenco, which helped considerably. It was 15 years ago, and I had recently arrived in southern Spain, one of 30 or so American college girls well primed for the modest adventure of a junior year abroad. It was October, and the heat that turns the streets of Cordoba to molten tar had only recently subsided, so that we were just beginning to recognize the beauty of that city's winding alleyways and flowering balconies. We would walk the mile to school each day in small, chattering groups, past shopkeepers who did not yet know our names but who recognized us for what we were: that year's crop of americanas.</p>
        <p>It happened at the first party of the year. There are no fraternities on Spanish campuses, but new students nevertheless undergo a hazing called a novatada. For a month they are subjected to all the humiliation the upperclassmen can heap upon them, forced to sing in the dining hall, wear their ears painted red for days on end, make their superiors' beds each morning. One medical student I knew was outfitted in only a diaper and papier-mache wings, and hung for hours, putto-style, from the entryway to the university. At the end of this period of ritual humiliation, the novatos are welcomed into the community with a full-fledged bash.</p>
        <p>The party began at the dorms. A few hundred of us gathered out front around several immense vats of sangria, and began the trek into town. A trip that normally took about 20 minutes stretched into hours as we stopped repeatedly to ladle wine from the vats, which several of us carried. During those breaks we would sing, and, mysteriously, some of the boys would stand beneath balconies and beg the occupants to dump water on them.</p>
        <p>Finally, around 2 a.m. the group ended up at an empty bar. Fuzzy-headed and culture-shocked, I sat at a table with other Americans while the Spaniards around us threw themselves recklessly into an unfamiliar dance that looked to be half bullfight, half sex act. I stayed where I was, relieved to be stationary. But my relief was short-lived, for I soon looked up to see a boy with beautiful brown eyes. He was asking me to dance.</p>
        <p>I took one look at the dancers whirling smoothly past me with impossibly intricate steps and knew that making a fool of myself was by far the likeliest outcome of this scenario.</p>
        <p>''No,'' I said. ''I can't.''</p>
        <p>He tugged at my hand insistently. ''Yes.''</p>
        <p>''No,'' I repeated, panic starting to creep into my voice. ''I don't know how.''</p>
        <p>He leaned in close, the weight of centuries of Don Juans behind him, and fixed me with his gaze. ''Look into my eyes,'' he said, ''and you will know everything.''</p>
        <p>I was across the floor before you could say melted butter. When the dance was over, my pride was somewhat battered, but my love life had improved immeasurably. His name was Juan Antonio, he came from Marbella, and he had just initiated me into what were called sevillanas. I signed up for lessons the next day.</p>
        <p>My teacher's name was Maria Jesus. She was a small, dark-haired woman who, when she danced, radiated a kind of scornful sexuality that I would come to associate with sevillanas. In the following months I learned that sevillanas were common currency in southern Spain; everyone knew at least how to fake the steps. At every party and nightclub I went to that year, somewhere toward the middle of the evening the music would change, and the dancers -- who moments before had been flailing to the latest European pop -- would suddenly pair off, pulling themselves into the stylized posture of bullfighters.</p>
        <p>For someone whose only experience with choreographed dancing was an embarrassed Electric Slide at a friend's wedding, sevillanas posed a challenge. The footwork was not terribly difficult; sevillanas are low on the kind of lightning-quick rallies that characterize other forms of flamenco. The arms, however, were more complicated, and the hands more complicated still. When Maria Jesus danced, her hands moved, if such a thing could be beautiful, like electrified birds.</p>
        <p>But for me, the supple, charged gestures of the fingers and wrists seemed impossible to master. ''Imagine you are picking an apple,'' Maria Jesus would say. ''Pick the apple, eat the apple, throw it away.'' I picked, I ate and I threw away, but they must grow apples differently in America, because my hands never seemed to move the way they were supposed to.</p>
        <p>But the most important thing I learned was this: all sevillanas tell the same story. Every dance consists of four parts, narrating a tale of love found, love lost and love regained. In the first part, the man and woman meet. Their steps are tentative as they slide past each other inquisitively, as if to ask ''Are you the one?'' In the second section, convinced now of what they have found, they stamp their feet excitedly and loop their arms with all the joy of infatuation. Part three represents their fight or breakup. The dancers face off angrily, stomping menacingly in each other's direction. Finally, however, they are reconciled in a joyous affirmation of passion that culminates in the most spectacular moment of the dance as the man swoops past his partner on his knees.</p>
        <p>Juan Antonio and I also went through our paces. Our first meeting was followed by meaningful glances across the cafeteria and furtive late-night escapes from the men's dormitory. Half the time I felt as though I were living in a modern-day version of ''Carmen''; Juan Antonio would deliberately try to make me jealous, then soothe me with baroque protestations of his love. There were flowers; there was even -- I swear -- a balcony serenade. Passion, or at least the appearance of it, was crucial to a good college romance.</p>
        <p>For a girl from one of those small, intensely liberal schools where dating consisted mainly of excessive caffeine and sympathetic discussions of Kierkegaard, this role-playing took some getting used to. In truth I failed miserably at it. Juan Antonio would demand to know why I wouldn't play along, why I wouldn't swoon, why I didn't act as though I were in love with him. ''But you are not in love with me!'' I would protest, ever the pragmatist. ''How could I be,'' he would shrug sadly, ''with a woman so cold?''</p>
        <p>It did not take us long, then, to arrive at  phase three. The fight came before Christmas, as I was preparing to take advantage of the long holiday to travel to Italy, Greece, perhaps Turkey. Juan Antonio could not believe that I would not come home with him, that I preferred to travel alone. He yelled and called me names; I stomped out and took a cab to the train station. When I returned five weeks later, the new semester's group of Americans had arrived and Juan Antonio had already found a taller, blonder and (I could only assume) more sentimental version of me.</p>
        <p>Eventually I mastered sevillanas. But Juan Antonio and I never made it to part four, never had our reconciliation. It was not for lack of effort on his part. At a party one night late in the semester he asked to take a walk with me. We stepped outside to stroll through the gardens. He was his old Don Juan self again; at one point he plucked a rose and handed it to me, with favorable comparisons to my beauty. We stopped to sit for a moment, and he leaned in close. ''One kiss,'' he murmured. ''You know I have always loved you.'' ''No, Juan Antonio, you don't,'' I gently reminded him.</p>
        <p>''Yes, I do.''</p>
        <p>''No, you don't.''</p>
        <p>Finally he gave up in disgust. ''You must always be so strong, so hard,'' he spat out scornfully. With that, he ripped the rose from my fingers and stamped it beneath his feet. There would be no swoops for us.</p>
        <p>I went back to the party alone. Soon enough, the familiar opening chords of the sevillana began to play. I looked around for a partner, flexing my wrists. That night I picked better than I ever had before.</p>
