        <p>Life is full of surprises, and one of the best that I have had this summer is false sunflower (Heliopsis helianthoides). I bought one last year, installed it, and forgot it.

        <p>Life is full of surprises, and one of the best that I have had this summer is false sunflower (Heliopsis helianthoides). I bought one last year, installed it, and forgot it.

        <p>My heliopsis, which was comfortably housed in a one-quart pot at this time last year, is now about 3-feet tall and 1-foot wide. It has bloomed constantly for a month and shows no sign of stopping. The flowers are great for cutting and retain much of their color when dried. The only thing heliopsis does not do is weed the rest of the garden. Buy one anyway; you won't be sorry.</p>
