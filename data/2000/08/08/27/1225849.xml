        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>When psychologists trace the roots of modern sports mania to primitive warfare, they reveal their ignorance and its contributions to an understanding of the way our earliest ancestors lived. The best evidence on this comes from more modern human groups living in small-scale societies with low population densities: the Inuit, Bambuti, Kung Bushmen and others. In these societies, warfare was unknown. It is not a part of the human genetic code. To say that it is, either as warfare or more harmlessly as a passion for competitive sports, is to project a dangerous and dismal myth about human nature.</p>

        <p>The article comes closer to the truth when Edward Hirt of Indiana University expresses the view that at the root of sports fans' mania is the desire to belong to a group, a need once fulfilled mostly by religion and politics.</p>
