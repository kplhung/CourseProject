        <p>DR. RICK MONTZ sits by the young woman's bedside, his voice gentle as he talks about what lies ahead. ''The findings aren't very good,'' he tells her.</p>
        <p>Despite surgery, radiation treatments and chemotherapy, the cervical cancer the women has been fighting for two years has grown significantly.</p>
        <p>''You need to look at what you want to do,'' Dr. Montz says. ''You have a limited time, and I can't tell you how much that time is.'' Then he adds, ''Long ago and far away, when I was really young and thought I was really hot, I would guess, and I was wrong so many times.''</p>
        <p>It is a classic scene: a doctor informing a patient that her illness is terminal. And it has been a staple of television medical dramas for the last 40 years, played out on every show from ''Dr. Kildare'' to ''Chicago Hope.''</p>
        <p>But in this case, the characters, the dialogue and the dramatic story line are not the product of a screenwriter's imagination. They are real, captured on videotape as part of ''Hopkins 24/7,'' a six-part ABC News documentary series beginning this Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Dr. Montz is a surgical oncologist at Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore, where network crews spent three months last year, following doctors and patients into the most private corners of their lives. The patients, Michele Ellis, 32, died in January, a few months after the footage was shot.</p>
        <p>The news documentary is a familiar genre and often follows a predictable format. But ''24/7'' is an unusual offering for a number of reasons.</p>
        <p>Johns Hopkins, internationally renowned as a top-flight research and teaching hospital, gave the production team unprecedented access, allowing them to film freely in areas usually hidden from public view. In one segment, a group of doctors frankly discuss their mistakes as part of a mortality and morbidity conference, the (normally) closed internal forum hospitals use to review their practice. In another episode, women with severe eating disorders participate in a group therapy session in the hospital's psychiatric ward.</p>
        <p>Phyllis McGrady, a senior vice president at ABC, who conceived the idea for the series, said that unrestricted access has been a condition set by the network in preliminary meetings with Johns Hopkins administrators.</p>
        <p>''It was difficult to say to them, 'You won't always know what we're shooting,' '' she said. ''But I had to stress that we needed to see what happens in a hospital, warts and all.''</p>
        <p>Her own interest in the project, she said, was sparked by her experience after her other suffered a heart attack several years ago. ''I spent a tremendous amount of time in a hospital, and I realized that there was an entirely different world than I had known of. It is as if the outside world doesn't exist. I wanted to see if in a documentary way we could capture that, to get a sense of what doctors are thinking and the frustrations that they have.''</p>
        <p>The challenge for the producers of the series was to capture this inner world compellingly in a short three months. A 24-hour command center was set up in the hospital, and seven teams became a part of the institution's daily routine, developing rapport with doctors, patients and staff members in the emergency room, the pediatric intensive care unit, the oncology ward and other settings.</p>
        <p>The goal, said Terence Wrong, one of two producers on the series, was to find stories that had ''a beginning, a middle and an end,'' and physicians who stood out because they ''were not just doing their job but were terrifically empathetic or terrifically passionate about what they did.''</p>
        <p>Small, hand-held Sony digital video cameras allowed the film crews to be a relatively unobtrusive presence on the wards, in examining rooms and in the operating theater, where they were on hand when Zach, 17, received a new pair of transplanted lungs, a highlight of the series' third hourlong segment.</p>
        <p>But perhaps the most difficult task, Mr. Wrong said, was to edit 900 hours of videotape into six stand-alone, dramatically coherent episodes. ''You wade through hours and hours of material and then the stories kind of bubble to the surface,'' said Peter Bull, the other producer of the series.</p>
        <p>Each segment tells several different stories. I the first hour, for example, viewers meet Dr. Edward Cornwell, a trauma surgeon who tries to educate inner-city teenagers about the dangers of the streets; Pita, a 180-pound sea turtle from the Baltimore aquarium who arrives at the hospital for an M.R.I.; the doctors gather for the mortality and morbidity conference; and a pediatric surgeon struggling to save the life of a 14-year-old girl with unterine cancer.</p>
        <p>''Normally on news magazines, the stories are linear and they come sequentially,'' said Mr. Wrong. ''The reason this looks and feels and flows the way it does is because our idea was to intercut the stories all the way through.''</p>
        <p>As in fictional medical shows, which also weave several narrative lines into a single episode, the saddest moments are balanced by medical success stories and humor serves to diffuse the most depressing interludes. In one segment, a mortician arrives in the emergency room, having fallen into a grave during a funeral.</p>
        <p>''Six feet under!'' says the doctor who takes the case, laughing.</p>
        <p>''I don't know how deep it was,'' the patient says with a grumble.</p>
        <p>And in a gamble, the producers of ''24/7'' decided to do without narration by an on-air correspondent, opting instead for voice-overs by the doctors, patients and family members featured in the series, recorded in sit-down interviews after filming was completed. Sylvia Chase, a correspondent for ABC's ''20/20,'' sets the scene for each but remains off-camera.</p>
        <p>The result is a series of television hours that bear some resemblance both to prime-time serial dramas and to the cinema verite documentaries of Frederick Wiseman. Though managed care and the rigors of medical training are addressed in passing, issues, as Mr. Wrong puts it, ''don't make great television.'' Viewers are apt to become as involved with characters like Dr. Montz, Dr. Stephen Yang (the transplant surgeon who comands: ''O.K., breathe, lung! Do your job!'') or Dr. Kathie Pooler, an emergency room physician exposed to H.I.V.-infected blood, as they do with Dr. Doug Ross or Dr. John Carter on ''E.R.'' reruns.</p>
        <p>And by the sixth episode, a comment made by a medical student emerging from his first anatomy class becomes entirely understandable.</p>
        <p>''It's probably the most overwhelming experience I've had,'' he says. ''Emotionally, spiriturally, intellectually and physically.''</p>
