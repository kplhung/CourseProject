        <p>On these shores, soccer is often associated with minivans and sports bras. But to the rest of the world the game is better known for its sex-symbol superstars with over-the-top style. Now, the look seen in niche magazines like Soccer World is spreading to the mainstream. Spiky gelled hair, splashy team jerseys and sneakers with king-size tongues are being paraded by teens whose parents emigrated from serious soccer countries, as well as by boy bands like 'N Sync, Take 5 and Youngstown, a pop band that adopted soccer style while touring in Europe last year. ''Club kids and wannabe rappers are starting to buy the jerseys because they're tight-fitting, shiny, and the material absorbs sweat,'' said Paul Castro, 17, who was born in Ecuador and works at Shoot 'N Score, a soccer specialty store in Jersey City, which sells hard-to-come-by foreign brands like Kappa and Lotto. Meanwhile, Puma, Dolce &amp; Gabbana and Emporio Armani are introducing soccer-inspired sneakers this fall, with bright colors and oversize tongues. Adidas's classic Sambas are being snapped up by fashion stylists and rock stars, including Dave Grohl, lead singer of Foo Fighters. ''Teens in America are embracing their different ethnic backgrounds,'' said Sammy Lopez, 23, a singer with Youngstown, whose parents were born in Puerto Rico. ''The soccer look is one way of saying, 'I'm proud of where I came from.' ''</p>
