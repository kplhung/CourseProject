        <p>I'VE been dressing myself for 45 years now, and there have been few surprises. The latest was last month. I bought my first piece of tailored stretch clothing: a poplin dress shirt, in a cotton Lycra blend, from Banana Republic.</p>
        <p>It was blue. It was bouncy. On that Monday morning, I put it on. I pulled it down by the shirttails to tuck it into my trousers. It snapped back up. I looked over my shoulder in a panic and moved away from the window. I pulled it down again, slowly, and we hung there together in a kind of aerobic boing. It was clothing with a vote -- my dictatorial sartorial days were over.</p>

        <p>I'VE been dressing myself for 45 years now, and there have been few surprises. The latest was last month. I bought my first piece of tailored stretch clothing: a poplin dress shirt, in a cotton Lycra blend, from Banana Republic.</p>
        <p>It was blue. It was bouncy. On that Monday morning, I put it on. I pulled it down by the shirttails to tuck it into my trousers. It snapped back up. I looked over my shoulder in a panic and moved away from the window. I pulled it down again, slowly, and we hung there together in a kind of aerobic boing. It was clothing with a vote -- my dictatorial sartorial days were over.</p>
        <p>I got to work, but my shirt and I were now in this together. I moved, it moved -- my elastic shadow. I felt like a special effect. My shirt took a few flexes on its own, with me inside. By noon, it had plans for the weekend.</p>
        <p>If the men's wear industry is to be believed, stretch -- once confined in my mind to prom limos and the truth -- is here to stay in tailored clothing, thanks to the general blur between business wear and casual and an awakening on the part of men that fashion can help them, too, feel sexual. The springy synthetic stretch in bicycle shorts is invading the upper body, in shirts and sweaters. The industry is also able to achieve synthetic-free stretch by compressing the weave of natural fabrics like wool. This ''mechanical stretch'' is no longer the exclusive, big-deal domain of expensive suiting by Jil Sander or Calvin Klein.</p>
        <p>Textiles with a technological edge, like the nylon shine that is now popular on denim jeans, fade in and out as fads. But stretch as a trend might be here to stay, remaking the traditional men's closet.</p>
        <p>''We put it in everything we can,'' said Michael Smaldone, vice president of men's design at Banana Republic. ''They're our best-selling items.'' Mr. Smaldone estimated that 50 percent of the men's collection in the fall would be pieces with a stretch component, 40 percent involving Lycra.</p>
        <p>''Who isn't doing it?'' said Stan Gellers, a senior editor at DNR, a men's wear trade publication. ''Name the line -- Nautica, DKNY, Slates, Kenneth Cole, Calvin Klein -- everybody has stretch. It was a gimmick; now it's a given -- from a young, cutting-edge customer to the mainstream in two years.''</p>
        <p>''Van Heusen is doing it for Regis,'' Mr. Gellers added, speaking of the nation's No. 1 dress shirt manufacturer, Phillips-Van Heusen, and its signature collection with Regis Philbin, the host of the nation's number No. 2 television show, ''Who Wants to be a Millionaire.''</p>
        <p>Banana Republic is widely credited with publicly bending the mental barrier on stretch with an aggressive advertising campaign last fall that featured business-suited models in yoga positions, firing rubber bands and taking active strides in slim trousers that would have split the difference on conventional pants.</p>
        <p>My poplin shirt, the model by which the company gauges continued interest in stretch items, was introduced in 1997. ''It was very quiet,'' Mr. Smaldone recalled. ''Like, 'We'd better hold hands and put it in the line and pray it goes.' '' When it outsold every item in the men's collection that month, which it continues to do three years later, ''we made noise about it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>A staple of women's clothing, stretch didn't get the warmest welcome from traditional men's wear retailers. ''It had a rough time getting into the classic men's stuff,'' said Gray Maycumber, senior editor for textiles and fabrics at DNR. ''Retailers thought it cheapened the clothing.'' Brooks Brothers, for 182 years a gold standard in conservative men's clothing, resisted the innovation, said Jarlath Mellett, the design director -- until it gave in. Stretch arrived without fanfare in 1996. Now, two large fall dress shirt collections, including Brooks Brothers' new color introductions, will be stretch fabrics.</p>
        <p>Seeing several new stretch items in its Fall Preview 2000 catalog, I called J. Crew, whose rollneck, chino-happy look I equate with natural fibers, especially cotton. Lycra blends at J. Crew -- that's like Quaker adding plastic packing peanuts to its oatmeal.</p>
        <p>Scott Formby, executive vice president of design at J. Crew, choked back a surprised laugh when I called him. Yes, there was ''high-level discussion'' at the company over stretch, he said -- ''a brawl,'' in fact.</p>
        <p>''It scared a lot of people,'' he added. ''A lot of people equated stretch with synthetic.'' They got over it. J. Crew introduced a Lycra-blend suit in 1995; Mr. Formby estimated that 15 percent of the men's collection this fall will involve stretch.</p>
        <p>What he said next snapped me back to reality. The stretch customer is different, he explained -- ''a little faster, a little younger.''</p>
        <p>Than I am, that is. My age exceeded my jacket size in 1992. My stretch shirt was moving with the times, but was I?</p>
        <p>Mr. Gellers at DNR agreed with Mr. Formby that stretch's best buyers are younger. ''Polyester double knits gave stretch the black eye in the 1970's,'' he said. ''But you're dealing with a customer in their 30's who never knew polyester stretch.''</p>
        <p>Banana Republic describes that customer as being the company's demographic ''sweet spot,'' a spokesman said. At 48, I am six months away from the end of their plank, which is 49.</p>
        <p>Lycra is six years younger than I am. Invented by Dupont in 1958 as a replacement for rubber, the elastane yarn trademarked as Lycra has 600 percent more memory for shape than rubber does, which is why even 4 percent in cotton fiber can turn a shirttail into a slingshot.</p>
        <p>This year, with growing sales and acceptance, Dupont introduced a $40 million global advertising campaign for Lycra, created by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi in New York and Geneva, which includes magazines, television, movie theaters and billboards. The television spots, directed by Jeff Kennedy, a music video veteran who has worked with Lauryn Hill, went on the air in July. They star Brian Delmonico, a National Collegiate Athletic Association champion gymnast, the first official ''face'' -- and body -- of the product since its invention.</p>
        <p>The fact that Mr. Delmonico is a man is not accidental. An in-house Dupont magazine reported that by directing their sights at men, the company was ''increasing the target by 250 percent.'' Print ads for Lycra are scheduled for GQ, Esquire, Details and Men's Health.</p>
        <p>Mr. Delmonico was dubbed ''Lycra Man'' in Teen magazine's July issue. In a survey conducted in 20 countries this year, Dupont discovered that men's primary ''emotional image'' of Lycra was ''modern.'' Fashionable and sensual were up there, too.</p>
        <p>This information produced a long look in the mirror last week, shirt-tailed and pantless.</p>
        <p>''What men now face is the problem women used to face,'' John Gagnon, an emeritus professor of sociology at the State University at Stony Brook, said when I called later that day. Mr. Gagnon studies sexuality. ''Men are more comfortable with displaying themselves,'' he explained. ''But as men move out from behind the suit, into sexual clothing, it means that their sexuality is on the line. There's greater display, but there's a greater potential for failure.''</p>
        <p>Would I pick myself up? My stretch shirt, with a squeeze of the arm and a suave synthetic come-on, was ready to make the move. Wait until it finds out what I'm really like.</p>
