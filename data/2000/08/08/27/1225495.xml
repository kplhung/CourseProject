        <p>ON the morning of a recent performance of ''Gotterdammerung'' (''Twilight of the Gods''), Wolfgang Wagner, 80 and a grandson of the man who composed the opera, was fighting off a twilight of his own. Mr. Wagner is no god. Small, combative, prolix and not without humor, he sparred with a press corps eager to know more about the star defections and family squabbles that have encroached on his 34-year regime as sole director of the Wagner Festival here.</p>
        <p>Founded 124 years ago by Richard Wagner, the festival is under siege from several directions. This press conference, accompanying Jurgen Flimm's new production of ''Der Ring des Nibelungen,'' had art as its advertised subject matter, but so quickly did it veer toward internal politics that Mr. Wagner threatened to call the proceedings off scarcely after they had begun.</p>
        <p>This is a country accustomed to command and control on one side, and order and acquiescence on the other. In what other culture would an opera audience allow itself to be locked in (literally) to a performance? My enduring image from a week spent in this small, dull but not disagreeable Bavarian city was of two well-dressed women standing at a curb late one evening. Not a car or a pedestrian could be seen in any of four directions, yet patiently they stood waiting for the ''Don't Walk'' sign to turn green. For a Manhattanite it was an eerie picture.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wagner took every question not to his liking as an insult. He is accustomed to command, and there was a palpable sense of a man who no longer had the energy to exercise it fully. His 11-year-old production of ''Parsifal'' had begun the week. It was a dreary affair, rescued only by his grandfather's breathtaking music. The principal props were giant crystalline stalagmites, shuffled into different formations. In matters of staging, Mr. Wagner leaned toward the emotive stagger, the beaten breast and the well-wrung hand.</p>
        <p>Decently sung and eccentrically conducted by Christoph Eschenbach, this ''Parsifal'' should have been the anchor of the festival. It is the one opera Wagner wrote specifically for the distinctive qualities of his Festspielhaus. He did so with the muffled glow of the orchestral sound and the easy resonance provided singers already in his ears. The Bayreuth production of ''Die Meistersinger,'' I am told, is just as forlorn.</p>
        <p>Other factions of the Wagner family want Wolfgang out, but he is virtually unfireable. His niece Nike Wagner has joined Elmar Weingarten, the general manager of the Berlin Philharmonic, in a manifesto proposing that the festival widen to different locations, introduce theme seasons and add early Wagner pieces like ''Die Feen'' and ''Das Liebesverbot.'' Intriguing is their idea to commission site-specific operas gauged to the peculiar qualities of the Festspielhaus.</p>
        <p>The story of Bayreuth is human nature at work: the good and the bad of tradition versus the good and the bad of change. Wagner's widow, Cosima, ran the early years in stern homage to her husband's specific wishes. These were, of course, wishes as interpreted by her, and Cosima was careful to get rid of adjutants who had been around and might have had a different version of the ''facts.'' Cosima-induced rituals of gesture survived well into the 20th century, as did some of the painted scenery. Yet her son, Siegfried, began the modernization of Bayreuth productions (often at odds with written directions) as early as 1908.</p>
        <p>I doubt a conspiracy, but the defection this summer of two longtime Bayreuth stars lines up alongside the Nike Wagner forces. The bass Hans Sotin, after 29 years at the festival, withdrew as Gurnemanz in ''Parsifal'' following the dress rehearsal, citing ''unbridgeable differences'' with Mr. Eschenbach; the administration line was one of puzzlement and disappointment. Mr. Eschenbach was on a plane to the United States on the morning after the opener, leaving Mr. Wagner to fence with the press.</p>
        <p>The more glamorous accuser was the mezzo-soprano Waltraud Meier, who, in an interview with the local newspaper the Nordbayerische Kurier, described the festival's course as ''sad and aimless,'' expressed horror at the Sotin affair and announced her withdrawal from future festivals. This year she sang Sieglinde in the ''Ring.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wagner, in an eight-and-a-half-minute response at the press conference, said that Mr. Sotin's decision to quit was purely his own and that the Meier affair involved the singer's competing commitments in Munich and Salzburg, which overlapped her rehearsal times at Bayreuth. Mr. Wagner had a point, but Mr. Sotin and Ms. Meier can sing, and he can't. What was offered this summer at Bayreuth was Gabriele Schnaut, coarse and deafening as Brunnhilde, and Wolfgang Schmidt, a vocal disaster as Siegfried.</p>
        <p>AMERICAN money is coming in bigger amounts to Bayreuth, which, like other European arts institutions, is no longer smug in the knowledge of heavy government support. With levels of federal and local underpinning altered in Germany, the nurturing of ''Friends of'' societies in foreign countries is becoming as important in Bayreuth as it has been at the Salzburg Festival in Austria. One major gift is from Alberto W. Vilar, an investment manager whose name and checkbook are already writ large at the world's prestigious opera houses. Mr. Vilar will pay for a new ''Tannhauser'' production in two years, and ''no artistic influence'' will accompany the money, Mr. Wagner said.</p>
        <p>Munificence like this has become crucial to the changing economy of opera. Yet it will arrive in the middle of a political war for control of the festival (with other members of the family also candidates to succeed Wolfgang, including Gudrun Wagner, his second wife; Eva Wagner-Pasquier, his daughter by his first wife; and Wieland Lafferentz, a nephew of Mr. Wagner); and whether intended or not, the money lands squarely in Mr. Wagner's camp. One image Bayreuth does not need is American money versus European art.</p>
