        <p>IT'S as if somebody made an ''All in the Family'' movie with Archie Bunker as a thoughtful political liberal. Or an ''I Love Lucy'' movie with Lucy Ricardo as an Oxford scholar. And yet there she is: Daria Morgendorffer, MTV's lovable animated teenage girl curmudgeon, with a boyfriend. A boyfriend! As Daria explains to one classmate, who is puzzled by the young man's identity and presence, ''Jodie, hell's frozen over and Tom's here with me.''</p>
        <p>You might think the creators of the television movie ''Daria: Is It Fall Yet?'' (based on the three-year-old series ''Daria'') were making a daring auteur move, playing with viewers' perceptions of the character, but they say it was all her doing.</p>
        <p>''I guess our role model in this is Stallone in 'Cop Land,' '' says Glenn Eichler, the show's supervising producer, with a Daria-like straight face. ''Daria is a big admirer of his career arc, and she wanted to do something different.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Eichler often speaks for his creation, and his explanation may give readers who aren't familiar with the series some idea of its tone. Since Daria was first drawn, as a minor character on ''Beavis and Butt-head,'' MTV's animated hit of yore, she has stood for certain things. Wearing the same green jacket, black skirt, boots, oversize eye-glasses and facial expression nearly every day of her life, she has been a role model for the smart and alienated. She is surrounded by fools (teachers, stressed-out parents, boy-crazy little sister, brainless cheerleaders and football players), with only her best friend, Jane Lane, to turn to. So how does she repay Jane? In the last episode of the third season, shown earlier this month, Daria steals Jane's new boyfriend.</p>
        <p>WHICH is where the movie, which has its premiere tonight at 7, begins. It's summer - as the beach-party opening-credits sequence points out - and every high school student has to do something interesting. Jane is off to an art colony, where she's going to see art-star pretentiousness up close, be propositioned by a bisexual woman (the voice of Bif Naked) and try to forget her friend's betrayal. Daria is being forced to play camp counselor at the O.K. to Cry Coral (''day care for sensitive children and those who'd like to be,'' says the teacher who runs it). And Tom is trying to work things out with Daria before he and his family leave for a month at Great-Aunt Mildred's house in the Cove. (Tom is not only cute, smart, funny and nice. He's also rich.)</p>
        <p>But the character with the most unexpected summer project is Quinn, Daria's perky, popular younger sister. Quinn normally lives only for the joys of dating, wardrobe coordination and lipstick shade evaluation (when she's advised to put her nose to the grindstone, she shrieks, ''What's wrong with my nose?'') and hangs with a group of well-dressed Valley Girl types who call themselves the Fashion Club. But she's so horrified by her low PSAT scores that she actually gets a tutor (voice of Carson Daly). And he has his work cut out for him; Quinn summarizes European history as ''Napoleon, Waterworld, the A La Carta.''</p>
        <p>But Quinn was always ''smarter than she thought,'' says Abby Terkuhle, the show's executive producer, and no matter what drastic character development may lie ahead, the series won't be changing anything that would affect its real appeal: the honesty, the fact that Daria ''says things that most people just think.'' And because, as Mr. Terkuhle's 6-year-old daughter has reportedly observed, the characters ''make fun of their parents.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Eichler assures fans that Daria hasn't really changed. Whether or not she continues to have a boyfriend, he says, she certainly won't be joining the ranks of the smugly coupled. ''Daria is still so smart and perceptive,'' he explains, ''she's going to be miserable for the rest of her life.''</p>
