        <p>IN the theater of uplift, ''You Can't Take It With You'' is an irreplaceable feel-good play.</p>
        <p>The built-in joy of living that lights up a classic at the Bay Street Theater here is unbound by time.</p>
        <p>Under the uneven direction of Jack Hofsiss, the Bay Street production is unstinting -- 19 cast members just for openers -- and evocative. It catches the eccentricities of the Vanderhofs and their visitors, some of whom drop in and stay -- one stayed five years until he died, which makes for a handy but terrific plot resolution.</p>
        <p>Grandpa quit working 35 years ago because he wasn't having any fun, and he's been a happy man ever since, collecting snakes, practicing darts, having nightly sidewalk chats with the police officer who is really a doctor. And paying neither mind nor money to the Internal Revenue Service.</p>
        <p>In Grandpa's ''every-man-for-himself room,'' in the words of the stage directions, Penelope writes plays -- war plays, sex plays, religious plays, labor plays, 11 in eight years -- only because a typewriter was delivered by mistake, so she gave up painting. Ed plays the xylophone and works a printing press: anarchists' slogans, calling cards, the menu of the evening. Essie pirouettes all day, or just lurches into ''The Dying Swan.'' In the cellar Mr. de Pinna makes skyrockets.</p>
        <p>Ask someone in the Vanderhof household what time it is, and this is the answer: ''It was almost 5 o'clock a couple of hours ago.'' But as much as they live in a wild and crazy house ''where you do as you like, and no questions asked,'' this is a family that loves and understands one another, to paraphrase Tony, the rich suitor of Alice, level-headed daughter of Penelope. ''There is a kind of nobility about them,'' Alice explains to Tony, who later explains that to his father.</p>
        <p>It takes time, but an esprit de corps develops among Mr. Hofsiss's variably selected actors, in spite of the director's misperceived notion that this play needs embellishment. Mary Testa's amusing turn as a drunken actress is diminished by schtick and even Talmadge Lowe, an otherwise affecting Tony, suffers an overstaged courting scene that slips, perilously, into parody in the first act. Mason Adams's understated Grandpa should have set the tone for the production.</p>
        <p>It isn't Penny Fuller's fault that she looks so young and pretty as Penelope; the fact is Ms. Fuller, in life, is older than the character, as written. The illusion of theater is not at work here. And in performance, Ms. Fuller is more of a charmer than a ditz.</p>
        <p>Joan Copeland, who is a scene stealer yet a true ensemble artist as Mrs. Kirby, uppity mother of Tony, would have been better cast as Penelope. But thank heaven, she is Mrs. Kirby, unlike any seen before. In a true repertory theater, Ms. Copeland would alternate roles, but don't let a privilege go unacknowledged. The actress offers a master class in how there are no small roles. With a jab in her husband's gut when he suggests that they return the next night, a sweep of her scarf, a precisely timed double take, Ms. Copeland gets laughs that must be new to this 70-something-year-old play, and establishes a poignant character besides. Who could ask for anything more in one all-too-short scene?</p>
        <p>Too bad Mr. Kirby (the excellent Larry Keith) returns without her in the third act, but after a transformative father-and-son moment, every man of ostensible status and success in the audience must be thinking, like Mr. Kirby, about his own private saxophone hidden away in back of the closet. That's when ''You Can't Take It With You'' sends out its eternal message.</p>
