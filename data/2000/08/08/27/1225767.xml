        <p>W. won't come out of his room. He's curled up down in Austin around his favorite feather pillow.</p>
        <p>When the going gets tough, the Napster hits the sack.</p>
        <p>Soft Money is hovering outside, eager to give its boy some remedial math coaching on the difference between billions and trillions.</p>
        <p>Big Oil has some talking points on the upside of having two Houston Oilers running the country.</p>
        <p>The Council on Foreign Relations is ready with some grammatical pointers on how to make subjects and verbs agree.</p>
        <p>The Polluters, the Pharmaceutical Companies, Big Tobacco and the Christian Right are in a huddle, looking very, very nervous.</p>
        <p>Jeb, suppressing a slight smile, is lurking in the wings.</p>
        <p>The Napster tries to shut out the babble of anxious voices by burrowing his head under the pillow.</p>
        <p>''One phony kiss and I'm down five points,'' he mutters to himself. ''In four seconds, Al Gore kisses his gender gap goodbye? We're neck and neck because I wouldn't neck?</p>
        <p>''This is not what I hitched up for. They promised me it would be a cinch. Karl Rove planned a rerun of 1896, when McKinley won without leaving his front porch in Ohio.</p>
        <p>''They said everybody would come to me, that I could coast like a cork in a stream, carried to D.C. by the tide of Clinton scandals. The country seemed fed up with power-hungry connivers like Bill and Hillary and Al.</p>
        <p>''Karl said America wanted another Reagan -- easygoing and sunny, not stuffed with facts and figures. Then Detail Man mauls his wife and suddenly I'm being called lazy and tongue-tied again.</p>
        <p>''Now Karl is fretting over the debates. He thinks I'm going to talk more about the vile hemisphere and America being held hostile by rogue nations. I'm not ashamed of those little slips. The hemisphere is vile sometimes!</p>
        <p>''Gore is so cocky because his bounce is bigger than mine. Republicans are wondering if I have the fire to win or if I just want to get back into the White House to play horseshoes and have Sunday hamburger lunches. They told me to stop saying that I won't mind if I don't win. Karl said it used to make me sound like I wasn't overly ambitious, which was a good thing; now it makes me sound like I'm not overly ambitious, which is a bad thing. Go figure.</p>
        <p>''I'm the underdog for the first time, but I had to clear my schedule this weekend. I needed a rest, man, after a heavy foreign policy powwow Friday with Vicente Fox, trading cowboy boots for a sombrero.</p>
        <p>''I've been pulling this campaign like a sled dog. One, sometimes two appearances a day. Those endless 10-minute stump speeches. And occasionally the speechwriters stick in a new paragraph and expect me to wrap my tongue around it right away. It's brutal.</p>
        <p>''Just because I got tangled up in trillions talking about my tax plan, people think I don't understand subtraction. I understand subtraction. The less we subtract from the rich, the happier they are. The happier they are, the more money they give me. The more money they give me, the more likely it is I can win.</p>
        <p>''I thought it was a good idea to keep my girls offstage, until Karenna made such a hit talking about her dumb igloo and how her dad slathered butter on her toast. Barbara and Jenna could have praised my nachos. Queso City.''</p>
        <p>The Napster hears the door open. Poppy comes in and sits on the bed for a pep talk.</p>
        <p>''Know what you're going through, son,'' Poppy says. ''Bush men have a hard time putting on the lovey-dovey. Went through the same deal in '88. Michael and Kitty Dukakis spent the whole Democratic convention hugging. Come on, that stuff about them dancing with no music in the holding room, looking like they were madly in love? Didn't seem real.</p>
        <p>''But then for our convention, I got all this advice to reach out, hold Bar's hand, and we laughed about it and thought how ridiculous it's gotten in this country.</p>
        <p>''We practiced the loving look, and the creeping hand. Message: I kiss. Had to stand closer to the Silver Fox, act more -- well, er, romantic -- on camera. Even gave Bar a pat on her caboose, right on CBS. Called her 'Sweetsie.' Started signing my little notes to her, 'Sweetie-pie coo-coo.' ''</p>
        <p>Under the pillow, the Napster sniffles.</p>
        <p>''Don't cry for me, Argentina,'' Poppy says, a bit sternly. ''Getting to the White House takes hard work and sacrifice. Things you just don't want to do. A lot of marital hijinks, stuff that gives you the willies.</p>
        <p>''Bite the bullet, son. If you want to be president, pucker up.''</p>
