        <p>LONG awaited, the new diesel locomotives the Long Island Rail Road put in service two years ago came with an unannounced feature. The train horns made such a racket that thousands couldn't sleep.</p>
        <p>Now an even more widely heralded project -- to provide a direct rail link to Grand Central Terminal -- is advancing. And once more there are unexpected consequences that are catching some Long Island communities by surprise.</p>
        <p>As hundreds of shiny new electric cars come into service over the next several years to provide the expanded service and replace an aged electric fleet, the railroad says new rail yards will be needed to store cars overnight and to clean them.</p>
        <p>And on densely suburban Long Island, where industrial sites are never far from residential neighborhoods, the railroad has disclosed that it has surveyed eight potential sites, from the Town of Oyster Bay as far east as the Town of Riverhead.</p>
        <p>The news is tucked within a tome-like draft environmental impact statement for the East Side Access Project, released by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in May but little noticed on the Island.</p>
        <p>The potential rail yard sites include an area just east of the Babylon station, vacant land in Greenlawn, a corner of the former Cerro Wire industrial property in Syosset, two locations in Yaphank, a southern portion of the former Pilgrim Psychiatric Hospital, an expansion of an existing yard in Ronkonkoma and open land near Indian Island County Park in Riverhead next to a residential area.</p>
        <p>The East Side Access Project would be completed no sooner than 2010, but the Long Island yards would be needed within the next several years. Three of the eight sites would be selected, including one on the Port Jefferson branch, one on the Main Line and one on the Babylon and Central branch. But the railroad said the other sites and as-yet-unnamed sites would be candidates for rail yards to meet other short- and long-term storage needs.</p>
        <p>Nowhere have the plans created more of a stir than in the Greenlawn hamlet of Huntington, the railroad's preferred site for a 16-track rail storage yard on its Port Jefferson branch.</p>
        <p>Train noise, night-time lights and increased automobile traffic from railroad crews would destroy the area, residents said at a hastily arranged public meeting called recently by a town council member, Mark Cuthbertson, who lives in the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cuthbertson and others said that what they found most astounding was the lack of any meaningful local notification that such a yard was in the works -- and still the preferred choice despite an environmental statement that conceded it would be out of keeping with the area and would have a severe impact.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cuthbertson said he became aware of the plan when a constituent called to ask about a rumor that a rail yard was coming to the site. He said that after a flurry of calls and letters to the railroad he learned the rumor was true. But by then, he added, the public comment period for the draft environmental impact statement was about to expire.</p>
        <p>''There has been just complete arrogance on the part of the railroad and the M.T.A.,'' he said. ''This is government at its worst.''</p>
        <p>An M.T.A. spokesman, Tom Kelly, said he was surprised by charges that public outreach was lacking. ''We don't do these things in the dark,'' he said. ''As far as I know, we give all these notices and stuff like that. It has never been a criticism of the M.T.A. that we do things in secret.''</p>
        <p>An executive summary for the environmental statement says the ''project has included an extensive public outreach program'' and ''dozens of meetings with community boards, the public, local and regional organizations'' and others, including ''interested governmental agencies.''</p>
        <p>But a survey in areas where the storage yards are under consideration showed little knowledge of the plans locally. Officials in Riverhead were unaware of the proposed site there, a town spokesman said. In the Town of Islip, where the yard at the Babylon station would extend into the hamlet of West Islip, there had been not a ripple, a town spokeswoman said. And in Yaphank, the co-president of a civic group, Nanette J. Essel of the Yaphank Taxpayers and Civic Organization, said the railroad plan for her hamlet was news to her.</p>
        <p>Brian Dolan, an L.I.R.R. spokesman, said that a hearing on the environmental statement held in M.T.A. offices in Manhattan in mid-July was advertised in daily newspapers and announced in notices put on trains.</p>
        <p>He also said copies of the statement were sent to local governments and libraries. Several Long Island government officials said otherwise, and at least one library, Riverhead, said it never received the study despite M.T.A. insistence that one was sent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dolan said the public comment period had been extended to include comments made by the standing-room-only crowd at the Huntington hearing, which was held on Aug. 15. He stressed that the yard plans were tentative.</p>
        <p>The Long Island storage yards are a small part of the $17.1 billion M.T.A. capital budget. The L.I.R.R. portion includes $1 billion for 472 new electric cars and overhauling some existing cars, and $1.1 billion for infrastructure improvements, track, signals, bridge replacements and the new yards.</p>
        <p>But in Greenlawn and elsewhere in Huntington, feeling was running high that the area should have been more pointedly put on notice of the proposed yard there.</p>
        <p>Kevin M. Gary, a lawyer who lives 600 feet from the proposed Greenlawn yard, and a lawyer neighbor, Gary Schoer, have filed a class-action lawsuit in federal court charging that federal transportation officials, the M.T.A. and the railroad flouted public notification requirements in the National Environmental Policy Act. The East Side Access Project is partly funded by the federal government.</p>
        <p>''If this happens people are going to listen to the whistles, see the lights and smell the fumes 24 hours a day, seven days a week,'' Mr. Gary said. ''It will be a nightmare.'' He wants the town to condemn the property for a park before the M.T.A., which has condemnation powers, condemns if for use as a rail yard.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gary and Mr. Cuthbertson said they were particularly alarmed to note that under the ''no action'' alternative in the impact statement, the Greenlawn property would still be an eight-rail storage yard. They said this showed that the railroad already planned a yard there in advance of the East Side project.</p>
        <p>Lawrence H. Silverman, the chairman of the Long Island Rail Road commuter council and a Huntington resident, said popping surprises on the unsuspecting was ''typical'' of the railroad.</p>
        <p>''As so many times in the past, there is a complete failure of community outreach,'' he said. ''Often the communities and the riders are the last to know about changes that are going to affect them.''</p>
        <p>Carl L. Marcellino of Oyster Bay and John J. Flanagan of Northport, the Republicans whose state Senate and state Assembly districts include the Greenlawn site, have vowed that no yard will be built there. ''The Greenlawn rail yard will never see the light of day,'' Senator Marcellino said.</p>
        <p>Assemblyman Flanagan said it was his position that the M.T.A. would need yearly appropriations to proceed with the East Side plan, and that financing for rail yards could be withheld. ''They made a mistake,'' he said of the Greenlawn yard. ''It's not a good site.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Silverman, a Democrat running to unseat Mr. Marcellino, said only Governor Pataki could change a plan that was already funded. ''The M.T.A. is not controlled by the state legislature, but by the governor,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The rail yard would also be unwelcomed at an alternative Port Jefferson branch site at the former Cerro Wire plant in Syosset. Morton Weber, a lawyer for the owners, the Tribune Company, said the yard ''could not be accommodated'' at the site, where an upscale mall anchored by Neiman Marcus and other yet-unannounced retail stores was planned.</p>
        <p>''I think the residents would rather have Neiman Marcus than dirty railroad cars,'' Mr. Morton said. Many residents near the site oppose the new mall because of traffic concerns. A Town of Oyster Bay hearing on a special-use permit for the proposed 860,000-square-foot mall is scheduled for Sept. 7.</p>
        <p>The town supervisor, John Venditto, said last week he was unaware that the site was an alternative for a rail yard. He said aides had to download the environmental statement from the M.T.A. Web site, www.mta.nyc.ny.us.</p>
        <p>''A railroad yard is a very heavy-duty, obnoxious use and would belong in very, very few places I could think of,'' Mr. Venditto said. ''Whether or not something like that could happen at the Cerro Wire site is questionable.''</p>
        <p>In Port Jefferson Station, where the railroad recently built a new diesel storage and maintenance yard, a railroad critic said the quality of life in a nearby residential area had crumbled because of engine noise, whistles, fumes and vibrations.</p>
        <p>Jane Capon, whose home is near the new yard, said the railroad had been evasive about what was planned when construction began. ''They put us off for a whole year about what was going on,'' she said. ''We didn't even have a chance to fight against it.''</p>
        <p>Excessively loud horns on 46 new diesels that brought complaints from residents all along the railroad's non-electrified lines eventually prompted action. Last November, the M.T.A. chairman, E. Virgil Conway, announced that new, more mellow horns would be installed that still met a 96-decibel legal standard.</p>
        <p>The new horns, unlike the originals, also allow engineers to shorten blasts. But the sound they make has been likened to giant fingernails scratching the bottom of an empty barrel.</p>
        <p>The horns will eventually be heard by a wider audience as the railroad increases dual-mode service with locomotives capable of operating on electrified and non-electrified track on the Port Jefferson, Montauk and Oyster Bay branches.</p>
