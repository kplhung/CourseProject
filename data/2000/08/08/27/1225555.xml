        <p>Nature's Ways</p>
        <p>Barbara Milton, director of the Connecticut Audubon Coastal Center in Milford, will conduct a program for families entitled ''Looking for Patterns in Nature'' on Wednesday at 7 p.m. at the center, 1 Milford Point Road.</p>
        <p>Ms. Milton, a former math teacher, has come to believe that students would better appreciate why they are required to learn certain disciplines if the subjects were not presented in the language of math, for example, but as descriptions of patterns as they appear in nature.</p>
        <p>Her talk will focus on patterns among plants, animals, water salinity and land in the Charles E. Wheeler Salt Marsh. She will seek to illustrate her theory by answering ecological questions such as, why is there a greater diversity of fish in New Haven harbor than at the mouth of the Housatonic River? Or, how do the vegetation patterns of a salt marsh change with increases and decreases of salinity? What is the relation between fish populations and mosquito populations, and what is the effect of the increasing population of night herons on Charles Island on the decreasing population of piping plovers on Milford Point?</p>
        <p>To register ($6, $4 for children), call (203) 878-7440.</p>
        <p>Feng Shui Explained</p>
        <p>All that you wanted to know about Feng Shui but were too skeptical to ask will be explained in a two-day workshop next weekend, conducted by the New England School of Feng Shui in Waterbury.</p>
        <p>Feng Shui fundamentals on the agenda from 9 to 5 on Saturday include Chi, Five Elements, Tao, Balance, Bagua, Schools of Feng Shui and Basic Cures. The class will be conducted by the instructors and co-founders of the school, Amy Mims and Susan Pildis, who have been teaching this ancient Chinese art throughout New England.</p>
        <p>On Sunday from 9 to 5 the instructor will be Bruce Lipton, a cellular biologist and associate professor of anatomy at the University of Wisconsin's School of Medicine. He will address the subject of Biology and Environment.</p>
        <p>Feng Shui is seen as a way of understanding why one feels and functions best in certain surroundings and not in others, and how one's surroundings can be brought to a state of optimum benefit at home or at work.</p>
        <p>Next weekend's course is the first of a series of monthly sessions through June 2001. Students may sign up for a single weekend at $350 or the entire 10-weekend series at $3,250. All classes are held at the Sheraton Waterbury Conference Center, 3580 East Main Street, led by a faculty of 11 (including Ms. Mims and Ms. Pildis), from the fields of architecture, garden design, clutter and the clearing of space, interior design and ecology.</p>
        <p>To register or obtain information call (203) 268-9483 or (203) 272-3765.</p>

        <p>Treasure Hunt</p>
        <p>The 25th annual book sale of the Cyrenius H. Booth Library in Newtown promises to be quite a Labor Day weekend blockbuster.</p>
        <p>More than 150,000 books, computer software, long-playing records, games and puzzles will be for sale.</p>
        <p>In addition, the rare book room has some treasures to offer including a 24-volume leather-bound set of the works of William Makepeace Thackeray dated 1869, seven first editions of poetry by Lord Byron from 1816, Sophie Tucker's signed autobiography, ''Poor Richard's Almanacks'' signed by Norman Rockwell and ''Known Fables'' signed by Antonio Frasconi.</p>
        <p>The sale has come a long way since 1975 when it was held on a folding table set up in front of the library and grossed $35. Today it takes more than 200 tables to hold the books, arranged alphabetically by author in some 70 categories.</p>
        <p>The sale, having outgrown the library and its parking lot, was moved a few years ago to Bridgeport Hall on the campus of the former Fairfield Hills Psychiatric Hospital.</p>
        <p>To get there take Interstate 84 to Exit 11, go left off the ramp onto Mile Hill Road and follow the signs.</p>
        <p>Tickets for admission will go on sale at 7 a.m. on Saturday; admission will $10 from 9 a.m. to noon and $5 from noon to 5 p.m on Saturday. Admission thereafter, from Sunday through Wednesday, is free.</p>
        <p>Books will be sold at marked price on Saturday and Sunday (Sunday hours are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.), half-price on Monday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.</p>
        <p>From 2:30 to 4:30 p.m. on Monday and from 2 to 6 p.m. on Tuesday the price will be $5 a bag.</p>
        <p>Leftovers will be free on Wednesday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Donations will be appreciated.</p>
        <p>The number to call for information is (203) 426-4533.</p>

        <p>When patrons attend a performance of ''Tony and Tina's Wedding'' at the Garde Arts Center in New London they will be treated as family and guests of the bride or groom. They will interact involuntarily with the players in this Off Broadway comedy hit, and attend a dinner reception at the Radisson Hotel next door, included in the $65 ticket price.</p>
