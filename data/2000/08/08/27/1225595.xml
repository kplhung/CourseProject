        <p>The Department of Sanitation has proposed reducing trash pickup at Southbridge Towers, a sprawling Mitchell-Lama complex next to the Brooklyn Bridge at 90 Beekman Street, to three days a week from six. But residents say the complex, which houses more than 5,000 co-op tenants, cannot handle the service cut.</p>
        <p>''We have no facilities for storing trash indoors,'' said Paul Hovitz, vice president of the buildings' board of directors. ''We are right near the Fulton Fish Market. With garbage sitting outside and all the construction going on, there is a vermin problem.''</p>

        <p>The Department of Sanitation has proposed reducing trash pickup at Southbridge Towers, a sprawling Mitchell-Lama complex next to the Brooklyn Bridge at 90 Beekman Street, to three days a week from six. But residents say the complex, which houses more than 5,000 co-op tenants, cannot handle the service cut.</p>
        <p>''We have no facilities for storing trash indoors,'' said Paul Hovitz, vice president of the buildings' board of directors. ''We are right near the Fulton Fish Market. With garbage sitting outside and all the construction going on, there is a vermin problem.''</p>
        <p>Sanitation Department officials said the proposed cut for Southbridge, which has had service on six days for at least 23 years, stemmed from a survey of collection routes in the area.</p>
        <p>''Between 1995 and 2000, we experienced a 39 percent increase in weekly tonnage in Community Board 1,'' said Peter Fenty, a spokesman. ''Because the population has grown, our routes need to be re-evaluated.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fenty said that similar cuts took effect last April in parts of Chelsea and Midtown, and that those ''neighborhoods have adjusted.'' Most apartment buildings in the city, he noted, are serviced three times a week.</p>
        <p>But Councilwoman Kathryn E. Freed, who represents Lower Manhattan, said the city was not addressing the underlying need created by more residents.</p>
        <p>''That's not how you respond to growth,'' she argued. ''You respond by growing with it, not by cutting service.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fenty said no final decision had been made. But Southbridge residents said Patrick Monaco, a sanitation superintendent, told them at a meeting on July 25 that the cut would take effect soon.</p>
        <p>''We were told very clearly that we were getting a heads-up,'' Mr. Hovitz said. ''Since we have no other alternatives, we have decided to continue putting our garbage out as we had before, six days a week. If we get a summons, then we will sue the city.''</p>
