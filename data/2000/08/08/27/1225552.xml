        <p>LONG one of the major summer attractions on Long Island, the Shinnecock Powwow is also the major revenue-producer for the Shinnecock tribe. This year's powwow, the 54th, is co-chaired by a young entrepreneur whose respect for tradition and flair for retailing has made him the tribe's largest employer and a new-generation leader.</p>
        <p>To increase revenues this year, the Shinnecock Powwow committee has approved some new marketing methods, including a small television advertising campaign, a ticket package with a multiple-visit option, and a Friday start that expands the event to three days. The tweaking reflects the entrepreneurial savvy of Lance A. Gumbs, the tribe's leading entrepreneur.</p>
        <p>If the weather is good, attendance will exceed 30,000, according to state police estimates, though several local business leaders outside the reservation estimate attendance typically exceeds that level several times over. Even using conservative estimates, the powwow reigns as one of the East End's major tourist draws, rivaling the 45,000 figure for attendance at the Hampton Classic equestrian event.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gumbs, who has his own retail business, continues to spur the tribe's economic growth, combining modern merchandising and business strategies with traditional Native American values. Active in powwow planning for a number of years, Mr. Gumbs, who is in his mid-30's but won't give an exact age, is officially a powwow co-chairman this year for the first time.</p>
        <p>''The success of powwow shows us that tourism is the direction we as a people can take,'' Mr. Gumbs said last week. ''We're sitting here smack in the middle of one the top tourism areas of the United States. But for all the money and the visitors, there's a lack of things like major hotels, conference centers, and various tourism services. We're pursuing opportunities to do what other tribes across the country have done.''</p>
        <p>Does that mean casino gambling, embraced by numerous Native American tribes as a revenue generator? Mr. Gumbs was noncommittal. ''We are in discussion with several prospective partners about development opportunities,'' he said. ''No option, is ruled out.''</p>
        <p>A passionate advocate of Native American economic self-sufficiency, Mr. Gumbs recalled growing up on the 750-acre Shinnecock reservation, just west of Southampton village, painfully aware of economic inequities. One of his early role models was his first employer, Gus Johnson, an entrepreneurial Shinnecock whose carting business served residences and businesses in the surrounding community. Hauling trash in Southampton was a constant reminder of the greater wealth outside the reservation, Mr. Gumbs recalled, and a spur toward achieving prosperity himself.</p>
        <p>Helping Mr. Johnson was hard work, Mr. Gumbs said, but preferable to the main alternative: caddying at Shinnecock Hills Golf Club. He said he didn't want to chase golf balls for white men.</p>
        <p>A few years later the teenager was hired by Dan Rattiner, the publisher of Dan's Papers, as a general assistant. With Mr. Rattiner's encouragement, he enrolled at Adelphi University in Garden City. After completing his sophomore year, young Mr. Gumbs spent his summer vacation turning a roadside shack he had inherited from his father into a rudimentary storefront, stacked with cigarettes and sundries. A reservation-based store, he had learned, could sell tobacco products without charging sales tax.</p>
        <p>Even with the exemption, the first few years were difficult, Mr. Gumbs recalled. Clearing $700 the first summer and $2,000 the second made him reconsider a retailing future. The third year, he installed insulation so the store could run year round and began advertising in local newspapers. Business grew, and brought competition: a fellow Shinnecock set up a similar tax-free tobacco store in a nearby building.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gumbs created a new ad that helped distinguish his store from the new competition, and also spruced up the store's image. Putting his undergraduate training in commercial art to good use, he designed a logo, a slogan -- ''People of the Shore'' -- and staff uniforms.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gumbs has expanded far beyond tobacco. The Indian Outpost also stocks a wide array of merchandise ranging from compact discs of Native American music to packaged food products such as chili stew and fry bread mixes. Adjoining the original store, Mr. Gumbs has built a delicatessen and a wholesale bakery.</p>
        <p>In the mid-1990's, he opened the Trading Post in Green Acres Shopping Center in Valley Stream, selling a similar inventory of Native American crafts, books, CD's and jewelry. That was followed by the Shinnecock Gallery, which offers more upmarket inventory, with much original artwork, on tony Jobs Lane in the Village of Southampton. He said he has 31 Shinnecocks on his payroll.</p>
        <p>John Strong, a Southampton College professor emeritus who is an expert on Native American traditions, met Mr. Gumbs while researching his book on the Shinnecocks, ''We're Still Here.'' He described Mr. Gumbs as ''a very bright guy with sound business judgment'' who has brought a new level of business sophistication to the powwow. His role as co-chairman of the powwow, with Fred Bess, reflects the tribe's increasing respect for his leadership skills, according to Professor Strong. (Members of the Shinnecock Tribal Council did not return calls seeking comment.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Gumbs's brand of private enterprise represents a variation on traditional Native American economic activity that has some internal dissenters. ''There are other schools of thought that say Native American businesses should be run by the tribe, rather than by individuals,'' said Professor Strong. ''I think in the past Lance has been frustrated by that thinking.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gumbs defended his brand of capitalism. ''Individual stores provide employment for many tribal members and demonstrate to people on the reservation that building a business is a viable prospect,'' he said. ''Starting a business isn't for everybody, but if it's your dream you should go forth with it.''</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, Mr. Gumbs brought Jacques Ditte and Jan Hanna onto the reservation to film footage for the first television commercials promoting the powwow.</p>
        <p>''To succeed as a fundraiser, powwow has to bring in thousands of people onto the reservation, which means you've got to promote it in newspapers, radio and television,'' said Mr. Ditte, who co-owns Black Sheep Television, a multimedia production agency, in Westhampton Beach with Ms. Hanna. ''The tribal elders realize that, but were concerned about us coming in with lighting and TV cameras. Lance opened the door for us, but had to do a lot of negotiating for the commercials to happen.''</p>
        <p>In recent years Mr. Gumbs has become known as one of the country's leading Native American entrepreneurs.</p>
        <p>''I think Lance is to be congratulated for his success and the expansion of his business, involving members of his tribe and other Native Americans,'' said Deborah Champlain, a Narragansett who operates a Web site about Native American activities, newigwam.com. ''You don't hear many success stories like his.''</p>
