        <p>With about 90 major wildfires and hundreds of smaller ones raging across 13 states, it has been a summer of record fire in the American West. Close to 5.2 million acres have been consumed, and with dry conditions expected to last in many places for several more weeks, perhaps until the first snows of late autumn, anyone traveling near wilderness areas should check fire conditions and travel or camping restrictions.</p>
        <p>The best way to do so is to visit www.nifc  .gov, the Web site for the National Interagency Fire Center, headquartered in Boise, Idaho. It has frequently updated reports on fires, fire-danger advisories, travel and road conditions and maps, as well as links to the seven agencies represented by the center and to Web sites for individual national parks and forests, and some state areas as well. The United States Forest Service's site is www.fs.fed.us/fire/news.shtml.</p>

        <p>With about 90 major wildfires and hundreds of smaller ones raging across 13 states, it has been a summer of record fire in the American West. Close to 5.2 million acres have been consumed, and with dry conditions expected to last in many places for several more weeks, perhaps until the first snows of late autumn, anyone traveling near wilderness areas should check fire conditions and travel or camping restrictions.</p>
        <p>The best way to do so is to visit www.nifc  .gov, the Web site for the National Interagency Fire Center, headquartered in Boise, Idaho. It has frequently updated reports on fires, fire-danger advisories, travel and road conditions and maps, as well as links to the seven agencies represented by the center and to Web sites for individual national parks and forests, and some state areas as well. The United States Forest Service's site is www.fs.fed.us/fire/news.shtml.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for the center, Hillerie Patton, warns that fire conditions change ''not only day to day, but hour to hour.'' The center prefers that travelers check the Web, but they can also call (208) 387-5050.</p>
        <p>As of Aug. 21. , eastern Oregon and eastern Washington state had been spared the kind of widespread fires that have roared across parts of Montana, Idaho, Wyoming and Nevada. One major fire, a 4,300-acre blaze in Meacham Canyon, in the Blue Mountains near the Umatilla Indian Reservation, was still burning in a roadless area, about six miles north of I-84 roughly midway between Pendleton and La Grande, said Earle Rother, a public affairs officer for the Umatilla National Forest. But the blaze was close to being contained.</p>
        <p>Because the fire was several miles from any roads, he said, ''most travelers, hikers and campers should not be directly affected, other than that we do have some smoke that is affecting the area, of course.'' For updated information on the fire there, check www.fs.fed.us/r6/uma or (541) 278-3716.</p>
        <p>There was a continuing ban on open fires in national forest areas in and around Pendleton, including designated campsites. How long the ban would last was unclear. But, Mr. Rother said, ''We usually don't get any real respite from these dry conditions until the end of September, even the first of October, when we start to get some more rain.'' Because so many of its firefighters had been sent to other states, Mr. Rother said, Oregon was consider closing some public lands. ''The governors of Oregon and Washington and federal land-management agencies are pleading with the public to be extremely careful with the use of fire,'' he said.</p>
