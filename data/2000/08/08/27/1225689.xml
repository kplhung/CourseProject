        <p>Multiplexes offering stadium seating and Tex-Mex snacks are not the only ones adding a little luxury to a movie date.</p>
        <p>Obeca Li, a pan-Asian restaurant in TriBeCa, is one of a wave of downtown spots offering a hipper setting for catching a bite and a flick. Patrons pay $15 for a buffet with free drinks (courtesy of labels like Dewar's and Brooklyn Lager) and a showing of independent films in a lounge-style screening room. Metronome, a Flatiron eatery and jazz bar, has added Tuesday-night screenings of food-themed films, which are run with subtitles instead of sound ''so you can follow the movie and your conversation,'' said the owner, Bob Pereira.</p>

        <p>Wednesday night at Opaline, a bar and bistro on Avenue A, a filmmaker, Ed DuRante, curates a series of short films shown on a pyramid of video monitors overlooking the dining room (below).</p>
        <p>And at the 60-seat Cinema Classics theater on East 11th Street, audiences watch screwball comedies and rare rock concert films while indulging in student-priced fare like $3.50 pesto chicken knishes and $4 glasses of merlot. ''There's even a futon for extremely relaxed viewing,'' said the owner, Robert Goldsmith. ''This is the East Village, and here is the anti-plex.'' On the more polished side of the silver screen, Tribeca Grand Hotel's Grand Screen (above) has 100 chenille-covered seats and in-theater picnic-style meals. Open since May, the theater has already been rented out by actors like Matt Damon and Joaquin Phoenix.</p>
