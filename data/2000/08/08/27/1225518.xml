        <p>IT was nearly midnight and the rain was pouring down as Edith Sierra kept climbing along with a half-dozen other girls. The footing was slippery and the group's safety depended on the steady guidance of expert wilderness counselors.</p>
        <p>Edith, a 14-year-old from Hartford who had never been in the wild before, said she prayed the group would make it to their campsite on the other side of the mountain, though that was never really in question with experienced counselors from the Wilderness School in East Hartland leading the way.</p>
        <p>At that moment Edith asked herself why she had agreed to take this 20-day wilderness journey through 50 miles of forests, rapids and mountains along the Appalachian Trail in blazing summer heat. She had known it would be challenging, but she never expected to be lugging a heavy backpack up a 2,400-foot mountain in the pouring rain at midnight.</p>
        <p>''It was the scariest thing I ever did and there were times I didn't know how I would make it,'' said Edith, who will be a freshman in September at Weaver High School in Hartford. ''I just asked God to help me, to keep me from falling and to help me make it.''</p>
        <p>Edith was among 90 teenagers who found their way this summer through the woods of northwest Connecticut and the Berkshires as part of the Connecticut Wilderness School's 10 summer sessions.</p>
        <p>The school, part of the Connecticut Department of Children and Families, was established 25 years ago as an Outward Bound-type program designed to help boost the self-esteem and confidence of troubled teenagers by encouraging independence and self-reliance through the lessons of wilderness survival.</p>
        <p>''These journeys can be life-altering experiences for teenagers, some of whom just need confidence-boosting, but it also can be a virtual life-saver for kids teetering on the brink of a troubled life,'' said Thomas Dyer, the director of the Wilderness School. ''For many kids the wilderness journey is their first experience in the wild and offers them the opportunity to break the cycle of juvenile delinquency by proving they can do something challenging on their own.''</p>
        <p>Like the ''Survivor'' show on television, not everyone makes it through the grueling adventure. For various reasons, a handful of students each summer run away during the journey, as did several girls in Edith's group.</p>
        <p>Some, referred to the program by juvenile detention facilities, youth service agencies and foster homes, miss the nonstop action of the streets and take off for home or their detention centers when they become frustrated or bored. Others just miss a warm bed and shower, a hot meal and a cold soda.</p>
        <p>''It was a lot tougher than I expected,'' said Ben Williams, 15, of New Milford. ''At times you just don't want to walk another foot, but the hardest part was learning to be with all these other kids for three weeks. It was hard both physically and emotionally.''</p>
        <p>Both Edith and Ben, who were in separate crews (coed crews were eliminated six years ago because of sexual encounters, Mr. Dyer said), not only made it through the journey, they plan to return throughout the next year for caving, rope-climbing, camping and other tests of outdoor skill and endurance in the East Hartland woods where the all-year program presents follow-up sessions to enhance the summer experience.</p>
        <p>Both said the benefits of the wilderness journey stayed with them several weeks after the intense three-week sessions ended. They and many other ''graduates'' said they expected to stay involved in the school to enhance the experience.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dyer said two wilderness instructors, specially trained to lead outdoor expeditions and to handle clashes that often arise among the teenagers, try to foster whatever strengths emerge in crew members during the journey.</p>
        <p>''Some kids surprise themselves and others in the group by being good leaders,'' Mr. Dyer said. ''Others like to cook, and others are better at planning and cleaning up. But as the journey goes on, most of the kids find they are good at something, and that's where we have a chance to encourage them to develop that skill.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dyer said that while some students come to the program from juvenile detention centers like Long Lane School in Middletown, others like Ben and Edith are referred by case workers at local youth service agencies who said they believed the journey can help light a spark in some students.</p>
        <p>Students in the program, ages 13-16, receive extensive orientation on what to expect on the journey, and both Wilderness School staff and referring agencies are selective in deciding which teens should go.</p>
        <p>''We don't pull any punches; it's a grueling, tough experience that isn't for everyone,'' said Dave Czaja, the assistant director of the school, who was a student in the program when it was starting in 1975. Mr. Czaja said that for him the journey was a life-changing experience.</p>
        <p>''Once you spend three weeks in the wilderness with a dozen people, you find all those little things back home that were so bothersome and irritating aren't so bad anymore,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The experience made such an impression on him that Mr. Czaja later realized he wanted to spend his life in the outdoors helping children. He returned to the program first as part of the summer staff and later as program director.</p>
        <p>Ben said he experienced ''the challenge I was looking for,'' but could have done without heavy rains and hordes of mosquitoes that made the journey miserable at times. But he said it was the interaction among crew members that was toughest.</p>
        <p>''But out there in the wilderness I learned a lot of kids have it a lot tougher than me,'' Ben said.</p>
        <p>Social workers, therapists and parents said the program is well worth the $4,500 total cost. Mr. Dyer said referral agencies or parents pay $1,000 for each teenager they send, with the state picking up the remaining tab.</p>
        <p>Statistics from the Department of Children and Families suggest that the program has been effective in keeping troubled teens out of jail and court after they graduate from the program, and that they are less likely to regress or become involved in drugs.</p>
        <p>''For the right kids this is a tremendously helpful program because it is a very difficult experience to go through,'' said Perry Codianni, social work supervisor for Parole Services at Long Lane School in Middletown, a school and detention center for delinquent youths. Mr. Codianni said the school has been sending teens to the program every summer and that the results vary.</p>
        <p>''Some kids respond very well to the program, others not as well,'' Mr. Codianni said. ''But we always stress how tough it's going to be so there are no surprises when they get our there.''</p>
        <p>Diane Woodward, a case worker for Connecticut Junior Republic, a nonprofit social services agency that works with troubled Hartford teens, said her program has been sending children to the Wilderness School for nearly a decade. It was her agency that referred Edith.</p>
        <p>''We work with kids who are on the brink of getting into serious trouble, and for many the Wilderness School has made a big difference,'' Ms. Woodward said. ''The program helps kids like Edith to face things they have been running away from. Since she returned she seems more confident and less confrontational.''</p>
        <p>Ben's mother, Laura Williams, of New Milford, said her son went into the wilderness as an immature and at times irresponsible teenager, but came back with a different attitude and taking less for granted.</p>
        <p>''I told him he would be without his mother's cooking, Rollerblades and television for three weeks and that it would be pretty difficult,'' she said. ''But he was determined to go and I'm proud of him for that. He lost some of his innocence on the journey, but gained a deeper understanding and perspective of life that I don't think he'll ever forget.''</p>
