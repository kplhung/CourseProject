        <p>Watching the procession of New Jersey Democrats cozy up to President Clinton during his visit to the state on Wednesday, you could almost forget that in some parts of the country, many members of Mr. Clinton's own party are eagerly counting the days until he steps off of the presidential stage.</p>
        <p>A handful Democratic governors from the South skipped the party convention this year, fearful that any association with the scandals of the past eight years might harm them in their conservative districts. The Republican presidential nominee, George W. Bush, is courting independent voters and disaffected Democrats by running against the ''Clinton-Gore Administration.''</p>
        <p>Even Vice President Gore has kept his distance from the commander in chief, to establish his own identity and avoid being tarred with the president's personal problems.</p>
        <p>But in New Jersey, many Democrats sound ready to chisel Mr. Clinton's  likeness onto Mount Rushmore.</p>
        <p>Cherry Hill's mayor, Susan Bass Levin, a Democrat trying to unseat an incumbent congressman, welcomed Mr. Clinton like a conquering hero. Democratic Representative  Rush Holt, who is locked in a difficult  re-election campaign, praised Mr. Clinton's leadership and gushed about his charm.</p>
        <p>Their words were more than just flattery for Mr. Clinton, a man who had just helped raise $200,000 for Ms. Bass Levin and $250,000 for Mr. Holt.  The Democrats' eagerness to bask in Mr. Clinton's glow also reflects an enduring truth of New Jersey politics: voters here have remained incredibly loyal to Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton won New Jersey by 2 percentage points in 1992 and 16 points in 1996. During the 1998 congressional races, which took place after Mr. Clinton's impeachment and before his trial in the Senate, the only  Congressional incumbent turned out of office was Michael Pappas -- a  Republican who once sang a tribute to Mr. Clinton's nemesis, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, on the floor of Congress.</p>
        <p>A Quinnipiac College poll released the day after the President's visit  found that 63 percent of New Jersey voters view Mr. Clinton's performance as favorable, including a stunning 89 percent among Democrats.</p>
        <p>Democrats say the electorate is simply rewarding Mr. Clinton because the state is safer and more prosperous than it was when he took office. Mr. Clinton has also taken action on the two social issues of concern to New Jersey's moderate voters: strengthening gun control and protecting abortion rights.</p>
        <p>But some conservatives argue that New Jerseyeans' willingness to overlook Mr. Clinton's personal transgressions is a sign of a bicoastal cultural conflict being played out in the nation. Steve Salmore, a Republican  consultant and professor emeritus at Rutgers, argues that the traditional  values of the Midwest and South have been replaced by moral relativism on the East and West Coasts. Although New Jersey is still far more  conventional than New York, Mr. Salmore said, the state is influenced by New York media and the waves of transplanted New Yorkers.</p>
        <p>''There is a belief among some segments of the population, which are signified by liberal newspapers, colleges, old-line churches, which basically says, 'It's wrong to judge someone else's actions. Do what you  want to do. It's fine with us,''' Mr. Salmore said.</p>
        <p>David Rebovich, a political science professor at Rider University, offers  two other possibilities. Because New Jersey has one of the best-educated  electorates in the nation, voters tend to focus on policy issues rather than personal matters, Mr. Rebovich said. Given New Jersey's notorious history of political corruption, it also takes an awful lot to shock voters  here, Mr. Rebovich said.</p>
        <p>''When you look at some of the things New Jersey politicians have done, trying to enrich themselves personally at the expense of their  constituents, having a girlfriend seems like not much at all,'' Mr. Rebovich said.</p>
        <p>Whatever its origins, Mr. Clinton's popularity will certainly affect this fall's campaigns in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Republican congressional candidates say they will focus on specific local issues rather than a broad critique of Mr. Clinton and his fellow  Democrats. Dick Zimmer, who is challenging Mr. Holt's congressional seat, also plans to bring in Republican Senator John McCain to appear at a fund-raiser.</p>
        <p>''I'd take a John McCain over a Bill Clinton any day,'' said John Holub, Mr. Zimmer's campaign manager.</p>
        <p>When the presidential campaign heats up, Mr. Clinton will also be a factor. Republicans insist they will campaign hard in New Jersey this fall. But when Mr. Bush does appear in the state, you can bet he'll utter far more code words about ''restoring the honor and dignity to the Presidency,'' than direct criticisms of Mr. Clinton himself.</p>
        <p>It is unclear whether the President will be asked to campaign for Mr. Gore in the state, but Mr. Clinton showed on Wednesday that he wasn't willing to concede the code language to the Republicans. The president thanked Ms. Bass Levin for her unwavering support and seemed to equate loyalty to Bill Clinton with allegiance to the nation itself.</p>
        <p>''If you live long enough and you stay in public life long enough and you take on enough issues and you make enough adversaries, you will have your bad days as well as your good ones,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''The mayor of Cherry Hill was always there, for me and for our administration, for what we were trying to do for America. And I will never forget it.''</p>
