      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Showcasing aggression has become the cash cow of record labels and other media entities. People like Jimmy Iovine and Fred Durst laugh all the way to the bank. Sadly, it is all about money: there really is no message to this outrageousness. If only ''mooks'' could learn just how little their icons care about them.</p>
        <p>I have been on tours with Kid Rock and Blink 182. From my experiences, audiences react only to the celebrity of who is onstage, not to what is coming out of their mouths. I was part of a tour with Kid Rock in 1998, before he was ''somebody.'' He had no audience, he played to no one shouting his bad-mouth inanities. Once he got a bit of coverage in the news media, thanks to MTV, he became a household name. If artists with positive contributions could experience the same type of exposure, then a movement opposite to the Rage Culture might occur. Until then. . . .</p>
