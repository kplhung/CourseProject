        <p>IT is one of New York City's dirty and not-so-little secrets.</p>
        <p>For almost a century, upstate sewage-treatment plants have been discharging their effluent into the streams and reservoirs that provide unfiltered drinking water for eight million city dwellers and a million suburbanites. In the last decade those 102 plants, which have often overflowed raw sewage into the region's streams, have been seen as one of the biggest threats to New York's celebrated water quality.</p>
        <p>Now, Putnam and Westchester Counties have taken steps toward eliminating much of the problem by piping their treated water out of the watershed and into the Hudson River.</p>
        <p>On Aug. 9 the Putnam County Legislature voted unanimously to empower County Executive Robert J. Bondi to negotiate with New York City, which has offered to provide at least $100 million to divert all 38 of Putnam's sewage-treatment plants to the Hudson. It would be by far the largest engineering project ever undertaken in Putnam, Mr. Bondi said.</p>
        <p>Although some environmentalists have raised concerns about pumping treated sewage into the Hudson, others said it is preferable to releasing it into an unfiltered water supply.</p>
        <p>''We are persuaded by the point that sewage going into drinking water is not a good idea,'' said Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the chief lawyer for the environmental group Riverkeeper. Joel Miele, the commissioner of the city's Department of Environmental Protection, said the treated sewage was not expected to harm the Hudson.</p>
        <p>The Westchester County Executive, Andrew J. Spano, has pledged his support for the project, which would require new pipes in several Westchester towns.</p>
        <p>Westchester is also close to a deal to divert much of its own treated sewage to the Hudson, said Larry Schwartz, an adviser to Mr. Spano. The plan would involve diverting plants in Yorktown and New Castle that are jointly responsible for 53 percent of the effluent currently flowing into the watershed in the county. The cost would be about $20 million, and the county is waiting to hear from the city on what it would be willing to pay.</p>
        <p>''The bottom line is, We want to divert, and we want to divert immediately, to protect the drinking water,'' Mr. Schwartz said.</p>
        <p>All told, the diversions would remove almost half of the 10 million gallons of treated sewage that flow into the city's watershed every day, said James M. Tierney, an assistant attorney general who serves as the state's watershed inspector general.</p>
        <p>Diversion has been mentioned in watershed discussions for a decade but has never come to the forefront because it is so complex. In addition to getting approval from the state and federal agencies, diversion would also require the assent of the counties, the governor and the towns that would be affected.</p>
        <p>One reason for its emergence now is that time is running out, Mr. Bondi said. The money for most of the diversion project would come from a fund that would otherwise be used to upgrade sewage-treatment plants as part of the agreement the city reached in 1997 to clean up its watershed. That money is rapidly being spent.</p>
        <p>In addition, Putnam, like Westchester, is becoming increasingly reliant on the same reservoirs that supply New York City's water and therefore more concerned about the water's purity.</p>
        <p>The city appears to favor diversion. In addition to improving water quality, said Mr. Miele, it would vastly simplify the city's management responsibilities by transferring Putnam's 38 independently operated treatment plants to the county. Mr. Miele wrote a letter to Mr. Bondi dated July 6 supporting the Putnam project and outlining the terms under which the city would pay for it.</p>
        <p>The city's chief condition is that the project be able to handle only the existing capacity of sewage-treatment plants. The sole exception would be for areas with failing septic systems, like Lake Carmel, Peach Lake and Putnam Lake.</p>
        <p>Currently, the need to dispose of sewage locally acts as a brake on development that might threaten water quality.</p>
        <p>Mary Mears, a spokeswoman for the federal Environmental Protection Agency, said, ''We are supportive of the concept but do want to ensure that diversion won't cause a lot of additional growth.''</p>
        <p>The city's proposal also includes a demand that Putnam give up its so-called ''diversion credit.'' Under the 1997 watershed memorandum of agreement, the county would have the right to increase by 10 percent the amount of sewage discharged into the watershed if most of its sewage were to be diverted.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Bondi said he is willing to give up the diversion credit, it could prove a sticking point for county legislators who see a need for increased commercial growth. ''We're not going to give that 10 percent up for nothing,'' said Tony Hay, a Republican legislator.</p>
        <p>The project could also face resistance from the towns through which it would pass. The sewer lines would travel underground along major roadways in Putnam, then along Route 6 to Jefferson Valley in Westchester and westward, following the county's sewer trunk line to Peekskill, where the treated sewage would be released into the Hudson. The towns affected would include Cortlandt, Yorktown, Somers, Carmel, Kent, Patterson and Peekskill.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, the Cortlandt town supervisor, Linda D. Puglisi, held a news conference in Peekskill with County Legislator George Oros of Westchester, County Legislator Vincent Tamagna of Putnam and Mayor John Kelly III of Peekskill to protest the counties' failure to tell them about the project.</p>
        <p>''We don't know what roads they're going to tear up and what they'll do to mitigate that for the constituents we serve,'' Mr. Oros said.</p>
        <p>Money could also pose a problem. Both counties have insisted that the city pay for diversion, and though the city has committed itself to paying at least $100 million for the Putnam project, it has not said how much it would pay for cost overruns. The Westchester project is less costly, but the city expects the county to help pay for it, said Mark Hoffer, general counsel for the city's Department of Environmental Protection.</p>
        <p>Many city, county and local officials, however, said they expected the diversion projects to go forward.</p>
        <p>''If we can bring it to fruition, I think it will be a historic agreement,'' Mr. Miele said.</p>
