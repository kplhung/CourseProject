        <p>To the Editor: Dr. Perri Klass (''To See Japan, Try Rail Pass and Ryokan,'' July 23) has good advice for using the rail pass offered by Japanese Railways. Users should realize, however, that the pass is not good for the fastest bullet (Shinkansen) trains. Also, on rare occasions trains will use the tracks of private lines; if you should be on such a line, the conductor will collect a comparatively small surcharge beyond the rail pass.</p>
        <p>You can sometimes get a discount on a rail pass by shopping around, especially if you buy an airline ticket and rail pass voucher from the same travel agency. I got a 5 percent discount from a travel agency on my pass.</p>

        <p>There are two classes of seating, as Dr. Klass noted. I prefer the ''ordinary'' (coach) seating to the ''green'' (first class) because it's much cheaper and one meets more Japanese. You won't need reservations if you're not traveling at peak times. The first two cars of long-distance trains are usually unreserved and for nonsmokers (important, since a good number of Japanese are heavy smokers).</p>
