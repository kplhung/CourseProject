        <p>Beethoven composed the first ''Eroica.'' The Middle Mosel and Washington State collaborated on the second.</p>
        <p>Eroica, the wine (not the Third Symphony), is arriving in shops at a moment when riesling yearns to take center stage in America.</p>
        <p>Crisp, light, smooth, the elegant '99 white is a joint venture of Weingut Dr. Loosen (pronounced LOW-zen), an influential German estate, and Chateau; no circumflex Ste. Michelle, the Pacific Northwest's No. 1 producer.</p>
        <p>More a haute cuisine than an apertif wine, Eroica wants to be interpreted as a Washington riesling with German inflections.</p>
        <p>The idea was born when, after sampling a Ste. Michelle dry riesling, Ernst Loosen (pictured above) proposed a joint venture.</p>
        <p>Old World and New World grapegrowing and harvest techniques fused at Ste. Michelle, principally in its fine Cold Creek vineyard in the desertlike Columbia River Valley.</p>
        <p>Similarly, separate cultural values, ideas and practices mingled during the cellar, importantly in the step-by-step blending that sought and artfully achieved a high-wire balance among fruit, acidity and alcohol.</p>
        <p>Eroica -- poised, subtle, a complete wine -- is worth the $19 charged at Rochambeau, 389 Broadway, Dobbs Ferry, and at Cortlandt Wines, 447 Albany Post Road, in Croton-on-Hudson, and the $20 asked at Varmax, 16 Putnam Avenue, Port Chester, and Wine and Spirits Emporium, 98 Pondfield Road, Bronxville.</p>
        <p>When Eroica is carefully, mildly chilled, aromas and flavors of delicate peaches and dry apricots emerge; though dry, it leaves an impression of a tinge of sweetness; the clinging finish, a hallmark of finesse, is extra long.</p>
        <p>Only 2,400 bottles are entering national distribution; alas, curiosity, thirst and hunger will uncork almost all prematurely. The few rarities unhoarded almost certainly will soar in value at auction.</p>
