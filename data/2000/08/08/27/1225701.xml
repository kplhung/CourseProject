        <p>Inside American Legion Lafayette Post 1906, at 19th Street and Bath Avenue in Bensonhurst, a stained American flag hangs on one paneled wall.</p>
        <p>There is a pool table, a television set on top of an old refrigerator, and three men at the bar.</p>
        <p>The bartender's name is Mikey. The front and back doors are propped open, letting in the dying sunlight and a scent of curry from the street.</p>
        <p>Bobby Hair has dabs of paint on his face. He turns to the man sitting next to him. He's known him forever.</p>
        <p>''What's your name again?''</p>
        <p>''Noel.''</p>
        <p>''Like Merry X-mas Noel?''</p>
        <p>''No. Like Noel Parking.''</p>
        <p>''Boy that's something,'' says Bobby Hair.</p>
        <p>''You bet that's something.''</p>
        <p>''Something I never heard of,'' says Bobby Hair. ''Your mother must not have liked you much.''</p>
        <p>''Speak for yourself. She breast-fed me,'' Noel informs him.</p>
        <p>''Ah,'' says Bobby Hair with a wave of the hand. He makes a crude joke.</p>
        <p>''Hey give me some respect,'' says Noel. He's an older guy with white hair. ''I'm a hard-working man.''</p>
        <p>''Hard-working man?'' repeats Bobby Hair.</p>
        <p>''Yeah. I'm a workaholic.''</p>
        <p>''You work in Harlem?''</p>
        <p>''You know, I'm not feeling comfortable in here yet,'' says Noel.</p>
        <p>''Try your home,'' says Bobby Hair.</p>
        <p>Mikey the barman puts a couple of Heinekens on ice for Noel.</p>
        <p>Then the light above the pool table goes out. Mikey puts Bobby Hair up on his shoulder and waltzes him around the pool table like he was his bride. Bobby Hair replaces the bulb, and Mikey lets him down.</p>
        <p>''You're incredible, Mikey,'' says Bobby Hair, full of admiration for the stamina of the older man.</p>
        <p>''Yeah, Bobby. And you're dimmer than that 40-watt bulb.''</p>
        <p>Mikey goes to close the door. When he does, the television turns to static.</p>
        <p>''Hey you're killing the T.V.,'' screams Bobby Hair.</p>
        <p>Mikey opens the door. There is a sign on it that reads ''Members Only.''</p>
        <p>A man called Dino shoots pool. He's going to jail in the morning. He's feeling good tonight.</p>
        <p>Lulu walks in. She's tall, in her 40's, and has a curly bush of red hair. She wears blue lenses and her lips are wrinkled. She sits next to Bobby Hair.</p>
        <p>''Pssst,'' Bobby Hair says, leaning into her. ''I used to have hair like that. Except it was blond. Then I cut it because I started losing it. That's why they call me Bobby Hair. Even if I don't got it no more.''</p>
        <p>''This hair's real, honey,'' Lulu tells him. She has a boyfriend.</p>
        <p>Bobby Hair walks to the other side of the bar.</p>
        <p>''I've got to get out,'' he says after a silence.</p>
        <p>He is drunk now. He's figured it out.</p>
        <p>''I don't know what I'm doing here: 39 and nothing,'' he says. ''I got no dreams. I got no future. I'm not even a vet. I missed that boat. Guess I'm gonna finish this beer and head west.''</p>
