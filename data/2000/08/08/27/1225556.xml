        <p>JUST off Montauk Point, south of the lighthouse, Jason Behan, a 30-year-old charter captain, sits on his 20-foot boat, is named for the fly fisherman Lefty Kreh. The boat is laden with rods, tackle, a cooler and a friend: not a rare sight in this village, where fishing is a leading wage-earner and favorite pastime.</p>
        <p>But the image takes a strange twist when he dons a mask, snorkel and flippers and, grabbing a speargun, dives into the Atlantic.</p>
        <p>Mr. Behan, who grew up in Montauk and learned to fish from his grandfather, Capt. Lester Behan, said that although spearfishing was ''becoming more popular,'' there are still few who do it.</p>
        <p>''When people see us coming out of the water,'' he said, ''everyone wants to go'' to share in the novelty.</p>
        <p>The sport was prevalent on the West Coast and in the Florida Keys in the 1940's and 50's, he added, but ''I don't think people really know it existed much, that you can do it, that somebody will take you to do it.''</p>
        <p>Spearfishing is becoming more popular with weekend visitors and those looking to try something new. Charter boat customers have started asking for it; divers holding spearguns are popping up in waters all around.</p>
        <p>Still, the regulars who spear throughout the season seem to be restricted to those with saltwater in their veins. The challenge is one reason Mr. Behan and his friends, Mike McCarthy and Mike Grande, trade their reels for spears at least twice a week.</p>
        <p>Mr. Behan and Mr. McCarthy ran a kayak fishing charter service last year, but in April Mr. McCarthy went to work in Manhattan. Mr. Behan now takes charters out for light-tackle fishing, while Mr. Grande, a longtime friend of both men, works for a pharmaceutical company. Despite their different lives, they fish together all the time, they said.</p>
        <p>Anchored several hundred yards off the beach, the water is only about 15 feet deep and clear to the bottom. This is where they fish for striped bass, using two types of speargun. The first is a pneumatic gun, which uses compressed air, the second a band gun, which uses two giant rubber bands to launch the spear. The pneumatic gun, although easy to reload, needs more compressed air after about 60 shots and makes a loud noise, which can scare fish off.</p>
        <p>The spears, just over two feet long, are attached to six feet of line. When the pneumatic gun is fired, the spear shoots out with almost no recoil, quickly enough to pierce a fish, and does not pull hard when it reaches the end of its tether, making it easier to aim and fire. Both guns fire at about the same speed.</p>
        <p>When spearing a fish, the target is the center of the fish, behind the gills. A spear shot in the gills can bounce off.</p>
        <p>''The thing here is to be real quiet,'' Mr. McCarthy said as he put on a wetsuit. ''The fish will boogie if you make any sudden turns.''</p>
        <p>Spearfishing has more in common with hunting than with fishing, and it is much like snorkeling: it is as much fun to look as it is to catch. Small fish, blue crabs, starfish and plant life abound by the rocks underwater.</p>
        <p>''We surf a lot,'' Mr. Behan said, ''so we pretty much know every rock out there.'' Bait fish like to hide in the rocky shadows rather than swim where the seabed is open sand, so that's the place to look for their predators -- the prized striped bass, as well as blackfish, bluefish and sea bass.</p>
        <p>Mr. Behan followed Mr. McCarthy into the water, saying, ''We'll get comfortable and start in shallow water.''</p>
        <p>When the fish come into view, he added, ''they're not going to take off and run away.'' He was correct. After paddling around for some time, a school of around 15 striped bass surrounded him, circling just 10 feet away and appearing not the least bit frightened.</p>
        <p>Mr. Behan did not shoot, saying afterward that the fish had been too small to keep, under the 28-inch limit, a length he has notched on a spear. Since catch-and-release fishing, an increasingly popular practice with conservation-minded sportsmen, is not an option for a fish that has been harpooned, Mr. Behan said he is very cautious not to shoot smaller fish.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Behan and Mr. McCarthy returned to the boat after more unsuccessful searching, Mr. Grande joined the group, paddling up in a kayak holding a fly rod, with a knife strapped to his shin. Ready to move to another spot where, Mr. McCarthy said, there were fish, they turned on their tiny electric trolling motors, which are quiet enough to allow the boat to move around without scaring off the fish. An ordinary outboard motor can be heard miles away.</p>
        <p>''Be super quiet,'' Mr. McCarty cautioned as everyone dove in again. ''They're a little skittish.''</p>
        <p>Again they had little luck. Though Mr. McCarthy shot two fish, one shot bounced off harmlessly and while the second was a hit, the fatally wounded fish got away, a rare occurence.</p>
        <p>The next weekend, though, fishing off the beach in Montauk, the three encountered tons of fish. Mr. Grande, who again paddled out in his kayak, said he once caught a 36-inch fish weighing 20 pounds, and Mr. Behan related how he had speared a 40-inch striped bass ''as soon as I got in the water.'' That fish, which weighed 42 pounds, was able to drag him around, he said, but ''you just grab onto him and swim in.''</p>
        <p>As they made their way back to the Montauk Yacht Club after five hours on the water, towing Mr. Grande's kayak, they all agreed that Chris Miller, the dockmaster at the West Lake Marina for the last nine years, was the most die-hard spearfisherman around.</p>
        <p>Mr. Miller, 30, who said he started spearing toothy toadfish when he was 13 after one bit him, dives in water as deep as 60 feet, several miles off the coast. He and his friend, Augie Brown, also of Montauk, have trained themselves to hold their breath for over four minutes.</p>
        <p>''It takes a lot of concentration and training,'' Mr. Miller said. ''I would say 50 percent is physical ability and 50 percent is mental concentration.''</p>
        <p>When spearing large bass, he uses a gun with a reel on it, allowing him to swim to the surface before fighting the fish in. His largest striped bass was 48 pounds, he said, not quite a record, but big enough.</p>
        <p>Mr. Miller's training in deep water probably saved his life during his most perilous incident -- in a pool -- when he passed out under water while training. He was not pulled out and given cardiopulmonary resuscitation for at least eight minutes. Though he was in a coma for 36 hours, he suffered no brain damage, something the doctors attributed to his underwater experience.</p>
        <p>Looking back on his experiences in deep-water spearfishing, which he learned from Mr. Brown at 18, Mr. Miller said: ''We feel we get better every year. Every year we dive deeper and deeper.''</p>
        <p>One of the more challenging spots is the Race, near a group of rocks 12 miles north of Montauk Point and about 4 miles off Connecticut. That far off the coast, currents can play havoc with divers. Often, Mr. Miller said, divers will jump into the water up-current from where they want to dive and those on the boat will signal to them when they have drifted far enough. ''You feel like a minnow in a stream,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Generally, Mr. Miller spears blackfish and striped bass, sometimes taking up to 25 blackfish each day, his limit under his commercial license. They usually weigh over six pounds. He has also shot sea bass and fluke, a bottom-feeding fish.</p>
        <p>''In order to be a real good spearfisherman,'' he said, ''you have to pay real close attention to the actions of the fish,'' and different species ''have different reactions to your movements.''</p>
        <p>In the winter he fishes the Florida Keys, spearing groupers, snappers, cobia and amberjacks. The fishing in Florida brings more variety, he said, but the Island is more predictable. ''I do have a true love of the sport,'' he remarked. ''I put a lot of time into it.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 3, 2000, Sunday  An article last Sunday about spearfishing around Montauk misattributed a quotation. The spearfishing enthusiast who compared the sport's popularity in the 1940's and 1950's with its relative obscurity today was Chris Miller, not Jason Behan. A picture caption misidentified a man shown swimming with speargun in hand. It was Mike McCarthy, not Mr. Behan.</p>
