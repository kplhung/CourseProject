        <p>Labor Day, and the thoughts of laborers and the fruits of their labors, is tailor-made for the grape, and for wine producers. Once a year, a swig of enlightened chauvinism (emphasisis on ''vin'') is in order. This brings us to the Wolffer Estate '99 dessert chardonnay.</p>
        <p>What, you may ask, is a dessert chardonnay?</p>
        <p>At Sagpond Vineyards in Sagaponack, where the owner, Christian Wolffer, and the winemaker and general manager, Roman Roth, are German-born, a dessert chardonnay amounts to a riesling trockenbeerenauslese in drag.</p>
        <p>Essentially this white is made like a riesling and displays its attributes, including, on a reduced scale, the price: $32.50 for a labor-intensive half-bottle.</p>
        <p>Though not unknown, luscious dessert chardonnay is rare in New York State. (Fans of dessert wines from the Finger Lakes find its counterpart in late-harvest Vidal blanc and late-harvest vignoles.)</p>
        <p>What dessert chardonnay, trockenbeerenauslese and Sauternes have in common is a fungus called Botrytis cinerea. (In German it's edelfaule, in French pourriture noble, in English noble rot.</p>
        <p>In warm, humid weather, this mold pierces the skins of grapes left hanging for over-the-top ripening, dehydrating and transforming them. It increases the sugar content and imparts its own distinct flavors.</p>
        <p>The result, after a slow fermentation, is a tiny yield (Mr. Roth made only 792 bottles) and a wine that is syrupy, ambrosial. Sip the velvety Wolffer dessert chardonnay is like sipping honey.</p>
        <p>As usual, Mr. Roth's restrained style shows through. Though sweet, the wine is not cloying; its finish is near-dry, thanks to lively acidity.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roth finds in the wine ''aromas of peach and apricots,'' a common feature of sweet riesling. Serve it slightly chilled, he recommends. It goes best, he finds, with ''fresh fruits or fruit sorbets or on its own.''</p>
        <p>Since it isn't good for business, Mr. Roth can't tell you that if you drink it on Labor Day, you should go on a diet until Columbus Day.</p>
        <p>But I can.</p>
