        <p>For one role he wears jeans and a baseball cap, and chews on a cigar. For the other, he dons a surgical gown and eschews the cigar. At home in both the medical and art worlds, the painter and plastic surgeon Dr. Roger E. Salisbury wonders why more people can't manage two careers. ''People have trouble understanding the fact that someone can be competent in two different areas,'' he said. In his case, a lifelong interest in art was grafted onto a profession grounded in aesthetics.</p>
        <p>He is a serious painter, despite his long hours as chief of plastic and reconstructive surgery at Westchester Medical Center and professor of surgery at New York Medical College in Valhalla. ''I don't want people to think this is a quirky thing or a little hobby,'' he said, referring to his works in pastel and oil, which sell in such places as the Flatiron Gallery in Peekskill and the State of the Art Gallery in Gloucester, Mass.</p>
        <p>Dr. Salisbury, a Pleasantville resident and the author of four surgical books, has published his first art book, ''New York Colors: An Impressionist Ode to the City.'' It includes 49 reproductions of his paintings, including ''The Feast of San Gennaro, Little Italy,'' pictured here, and writings about New York City. Proceeds of the book, priced at $25, will go to the Children's Hospital Foundation at the medical center. It can be ordered by calling (914) 493-2575.</p>
