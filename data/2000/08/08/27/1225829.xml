        <p>Because of an unusually strong growing season, trees common throughout the New York region -- including maple, oak, ash, birch, beech and cherry -- are now thick with green leaves that over the next six weeks are expected to explode in a fiery display of red, gold, orange, purple and bronze.</p>

        <p>State tourism officials and arborists are predicting a spectacular fall foliage season across the Northeast this year, thanks to the same lower temperatures and persistent rainfall that made summer a washout for beachgoers.</p>
        <p>Because of an unusually strong growing season, trees common throughout the New York region -- including maple, oak, ash, birch, beech and cherry -- are now thick with green leaves that over the next six weeks are expected to explode in a fiery display of red, gold, orange, purple and bronze.</p>
        <p>This year's optimistic expectations are a stark contrast to last year, when drought conditions through the summer shriveled many trees and put a damper on the leaf-peeping pilgrimages that are an $8 billion chunk of the travel and tourism industry in New England.</p>
        <p>''It's been a super year for trees growing leaves,'' said Donald Smith Jr., Connecticut's state forester. ''So there are plenty of leaves to look at and plenty of leaves to get colored up.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''It's shaping up to be a very good foliage season.''</p>
        <p>Just how brilliant the fall colors become will depend on the weather between now and mid-October, a long-term forecast that meteorologists say they cannot make in any reliable way. One crucial factor will be any heavy rains or wind that could strip leaves from the trees.</p>
        <p>Although the ingredients seem to be in place for a vivid fall, Fred Gadomski, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University, warned, ''You can ruin your potential with a bad stretch of weather at the wrong time in autumn.''</p>
        <p>Perfect conditions for vibrant fall colors include warm, sunny days and cool nights, plant pathologists say. But weather experts say that long-range forecasting is always iffy and that fall is particularly unpredictable. ''Nature will reveal itself when the time comes,'' Mr. Gadomski said.</p>
        <p>Still, for state tourism officials and innkeepers, farm stand owners and  purveyors of hay rides and other autumn delights, the speculation can be far more important than reality. After all, nobody packs up and goes home just because a leaf doesn't turn the proper shade of burnt sienna.</p>
        <p>At many inns and country bed-and-breakfasts, weekends during peak foliage season are booked months, if not years, in advance. But in any given season, positive buzz (like this article) can increase bookings for week nights and ensure that cancellations are easily filled.</p>
        <p>''That's a case where the short-notice reports on foliage have impacts,'' said Rolf Hammer, the owner of the Homestead Inn in New Milford. ''People decide last-minute that they are going to take trips during the week.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hammer said that besides the leaves, there were other events, like parent weekends at local prep schools or college homecomings, that always made the fall profitable. ''We have owned this inn for 16 years,'' he said. ''We have never had a bad foliage season, regardless of what the predictions may be.''</p>
        <p>Still, something about the brilliant colors seems to make everything better, tourism officials say, increasing the numbers of people who attend harvest fairs, go to apple orchards or pumkin patches, build bonfires or celebrate Oktoberfest and, yes, drive around gasping at the dying leaves.</p>
        <p>''I am sitting here looking at the window, thinking, 'Come on, show me the colors,' '' said Diane M. Konrady, a spokeswoman for the State Tourism and Marketing Department in Vermont, which expects to get four million leaf-watching visitors this fall. ''Let's hope it's really spectacular this year.</p>
        <p>''Of course, we never know until we get there,'' Ms. Konrady said, adding that nevertheless, the conditions looked right. ''What it's meant in the past, especially when we get sunshine like we are getting today, it means a spectacular fall foliage season.''</p>
        <p>Peter A. Carofano, the director of tourism in Ulster County, N.Y., said he, too, expected a good year. ''From all accounts I see, it's going to be a beautiful year,'' he said. ''A spectacular year for colors and foliage.'' Picturing it in his head, he seemed to be swept away.</p>
        <p>''The changing of the earth and the shortening of the days and the angling of the sun becomes different,'' he said. ''Mother Nature just molded everything to become this beautiful time of year.</p>
        <p>''There are other times of year that are nice, but the fall, there is just something special about it.''</p>
        <p>Experienced leaf watchers say there is a noticeable difference between a mediocre season and a good one. ''My family has been in the county since 1740, so they have a long history of watching foliage,'' said John Calhoun, who owns Cathedral Pines Farm, a bed-and-breakfast in Cornwall, Conn.</p>
        <p>''Last year was very, very dry and what color there was didn't last very long because everything was brittle and blew off or dropped off,'' he said. In contrast, he recalled the vivid summer of 1997. ''Three years ago, it was very, very intense.''</p>
        <p>The intense colors come after a leaf, in a natural seasonal process, develops cells in its base that cut off the supply of chlorophyll, the chemical that makes a leaf green. Without chlorophyll, sugars in the leaf are released, exposing other colorful pigments.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith, the Connecticut forester, said he expected the foliage this year to peak in mid-October. But he did not seem particularly enthralled. ''The best time of year is springtime, new growth, rebirth, that sort of thing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Still, he said, he sees fall's merits. ''One of my best memories is being in one of our less-developed state parks in Redding in the fall and stopping work for lunch next to a pond,'' he said, almost getting into the spirit. ''Each season has its attractions. Fall is like the final fling for nature.''</p>
