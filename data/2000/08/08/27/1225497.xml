        <p>SINCE the days of Norman Lear, the sitcom had offered two choices in its portrayal of black life in America: there were families thriving amid upper-middle-class plenty while ever-mindful of their roots, a la ''Cosby,'' or families jovially striving to work their way out of an extremely mild form of urban poverty, a la ''Good Times.'' Both came with a generous portion of sugar coating.</p>
        <p>Then, in January 1999, came ''The PJs,'' a fast-moving animated comedy set in the projects (the ''PJs'' of the title), with a dim-bulb building superintendent as its hero and a supporting cast that includes a Haitian voodoo priestess and a crackhead who lives in a cardboard box. The series opened with the super battling a rogue cockroach in an elderly woman's apartment, where huge stacks of cat food were cached. It has since moved on to other inner-city scenarios. In one, two boys audition for a rap mogul and are told: ''No matter what happens, just remember that you're proud young black men. Now go in there and sing and dance for the Man.''

        <p>SINCE the days of Norman Lear, the sitcom had offered two choices in its portrayal of black life in America: there were families thriving amid upper-middle-class plenty while ever-mindful of their roots, a la ''Cosby,'' or families jovially striving to work their way out of an extremely mild form of urban poverty, a la ''Good Times.'' Both came with a generous portion of sugar coating.</p>
        <p>Then, in January 1999, came ''The PJs,'' a fast-moving animated comedy set in the projects (the ''PJs'' of the title), with a dim-bulb building superintendent as its hero and a supporting cast that includes a Haitian voodoo priestess and a crackhead who lives in a cardboard box. The series opened with the super battling a rogue cockroach in an elderly woman's apartment, where huge stacks of cat food were cached. It has since moved on to other inner-city scenarios. In one, two boys audition for a rap mogul and are told: ''No matter what happens, just remember that you're proud young black men. Now go in there and sing and dance for the Man.'' You're not watching ''The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air'' anymore.</p>
        <p>''The PJs,'' which is moving to WB this fall after two seasons on Fox, is the brainchild of Eddie Murphy, who wanted to do a raw animated comedy about black inner-city life and sold the idea to Ron Howard's Imagine Television and the Fox network. Mr. Murphy does the voice of the irascible superintendent, Thurgood Stubbs, who looks after a building in the Hilton-Jacobs projects, a blighted urban-renewal development in an unnamed big city (though you might recognize the projects' name as a homage to Lawrence-Hilton Jacobs, the black actor who appeared in such 1970's TV landmarks as ''Roots'' and ''Welcome Back, Kotter''). The first episode drew an impressive 22 million viewers, the second largest audience for a premiere in Fox history after ''The Simpsons,'' and ratings remained high for Fox, an average of 11.4 million viewers, once ''The PJs'' settled into its Tuesday time slot.</p>
        <p>Most of the program's rapid-fire jokes involve subjects rarely treated in sitcoms: staples of ''The PJs'' include shtick involving police brutality, random crime, race war, the failed promise of Lyndon Johnson's war on poverty and, without doubt the unlikeliest running gag in TV history, the unresponsiveness of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. In one early episode Thurgood's wife foils a robber, but Thurgood tries to take the credit, asking the assembled tenants of Hilton-Jacobs, ''What are you always going to find behind every strong black man?'' His neighbors' replies, shot back with the show's trademark speed, cover a gamut of takes on race: ''A slower white athlete?''  ''A curious white girl?''  ''A Korean grocer yelling, 'Come back with that apple'?''  ''Don King taking 90 percent!''</p>
        <p>Despite the good ratings, Fox yanked the show from its schedule twice and all but stopped promoting it in favor of ''King of the Hill,''  ''Futurama,''  ''Family Guy'' and other less inventive animated sitcoms with predominantly white characters. This summer, first-run episodes of the program have averaged 5.34 million viewers, 29 percent of them black.</p>
        <p>''The PJs'' achieved some notoriety soon after its debut in the form of censure from a few influential black critics. Spike Lee called ''The PJs''  ''very demeaning.''</p>
        <p>''I kind of scratch my head why Eddie Murphy's doing this,'' Mr. Lee told television writers two weeks after the program's premiere, ''because it shows no love for black people. I'm not saying we're above being made fun of and stuff like that, but it's really hateful, I think, toward black people, plain and simple.''</p>
        <p>The critic Stanley Crouch called it ''a third-rate update of 'Amos 'n' Andy.' ''</p>
        <p>But as ''The PJs'' moves to Sunday nights on WB this fall, its first regular time slot since early 1999, the criticism has abated. ''I try to make sure the jokes come from the right as well as from the left,'' said Larry Wilmore, who was an executive producer and one of the two head writers during the first two seasons. ''In the pilot, we had one where you see a sign that says 'HUD: Keeping you in the projects since 1965.' It's one of my favorites because it really, really is the kind of joke you just don't see. It's a joke coming from the other direction: they really did keep you in the projects since 1965. Even Thurgood's that way. Just his name -- Thurgood Orenthal Stubbs -- represents the highest and lowest points in African-American culture.''</p>
        <p>The sensibilities of Wilmore and of Steve Tompkins, the other head writer during the show's tenure at Fox, informed the show in its first two seasons. Mr. Tompkins came from ''The Simpsons'' and Wilmore had an extended stint at ''In Living Color,'' and the social satire of ''The PJs'' can definitely be seen as a hybrid of those shows.</p>
        <p>''We had a very diverse writing staff,'' Wilmore said of ''The PJs.''  ''We not only had black writers, we had an Orthodox Jew, two gay people, two people who had had transplants'' -- which may account for the many gags involving the high incidence of cancer, obesity and heart disease in the inner city -- ''we had women; anyone you can think of was writing for the show. The important thing in hiring writers is not whether they're black or white, but rather what kind of life experience they bring. I'm black myself, but it's not like a lot of shows, where they think only a black writer can write this kind of thing.''</p>
        <p>ANOTHER way in which ''The PJs'' stands out is its remarkable look, a stop-motion form of animation that Will Vinton Studios, the Portland, Ore., company that films the show and that created the technique, calls foamation. The characters are actually foam puppets, photographed 24 times for each second of film -- a ratio used in only a handful of feature films and never before in television -- enabling them to achieve a high degree of expressiveness. And the sets are extraordinarily realistic renditions of a rundown housing project in all its dreariness: run-down, cookie-cutter high-rises; shattered glass; graffiti-covered walls; trashcan fires in vacant lots.</p>
        <p>Tom Turpin, president of Will Vinton Studios, said the animators had two goals in creating the world of the series: ''One was to make the puppets really comical, so that everything visually says it's a joke. And the other was to make the world seem very real and gritty, with interesting real-life textures.''</p>
        <p>The technical effort alone -- ''The PJs'' won an Emmy for art direction in 1999 -- is impressive. ''It's far and away the biggest show in the history of stop-motion animation in terms of the number of animators working on it,'' Mr. Turpin said. ''We counted up the amount of output we had done for the 35 episodes we'd shot for Fox, and it came to the equivalent of eight feature films.''</p>
        <p>For all its visual and sonic appeal -- the theme song is written and performed by George Clinton -- the program's breakneck speed comes from its cast. Each character's personality is sharply drawn according to type or stereotype (depending on your point of view), from Michael Paul Chan's Jimmy Ho (Michael Paul Chan), a Korean tenant and militant supporter of the black cause, to Mrs. Avery (Ja'net Dubois), a crochety, stroke-prone, gun-toting senior citizen. Ms. Dubois, the veteran character actress who appeared in ''Good Times'' and the blaxploitation spoof ''I'm Gonna Git You Sucka,'' won a 1999 Emmy. While the cast records its performances together, Murphy's performance as Thurgood is usually supplied separately, from the sets of his films. The final result is seamless, the dialogue percolating with the speed of a 30's screwball comedy.</p>
        <p>The new season on WB, which begins on Sept. 8 and Sept. 10, will include several episodes filmed for but not shown on Fox, with new episodes coming later. Mr. Wilmore and Mr. Tompkins will only consult on the new episodes. The executive producer of the program for WB, Warren Bell -- whose sitcom resume includes stints on ''Ellen'' and ''Coach'' -- promises that the program's sensibility will be retained, despite a large turnover of the writing staff. One change that has already been announced should make fans of the original wary: Smoky, the emaciated, wisdom-dispensing crack addict, will become a former crack addict, though Mr. Bell is quick to say that Smoky will remain as addled as before. Mr. Bell promises that ''The PJs'' will remain fundamentally the same.</p>
        <p>''The show works,'' Mr. Bell said. ''I can honestly say that you won't see any differences between the way I'm doing the show from the way Larry and Steve did it. We're still going for big, interesting stories that are rooted in a projects consciousness.''</p>
        <p>WB is making ''The PJs'' the centerpiece of its Sunday night lineup, and the show's renewed high profile could lead to renewed criticism. ''I don't think about, 'Is this the kind of joke that will raise protests?' '' Mr. Bell said. ''I think about whether it's funny. We have a pretty solid contingent of minority writers on the show, and then of course we have the cast, so we're pretty well policed in terms of not crossing an actual line of offensiveness.''</p>
        <p>If Mr. Bell is able to keep it funny, ''The PJs'' should thrive after switching networks. If it doesn't, well, as Thurgood once said -- while losing consciousness after being gassed by HUD security -- ''And then, like a public school, everything turned black.''</p>
