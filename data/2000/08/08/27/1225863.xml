        <p>''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' is working its magic in Westchester.</p>
        <p>Since its release on July 8, the wildly popular children's book has been checked out of Westchester's 38 libraries more than 850 times, said Judith Rovenger, youth services consultant for the Westchester Library System. Twenty-three youngsters are on the reserve waiting list to read one of the 301 copies in the county's libraries.</p>
        <p>''The Harry Potter books really speak to children,'' Ms. Rovenger said. ''They combine elements of whimsical and heroic good-versus-evil fantasy; they are also coming-of-age tales. Kids are hungry for this kind of thing.''</p>
        <p>Hungry enough to participate in ''lots of innovative programs'' based on Harry Potter, she added. Libraries have held competitions in Quidditch, the sports-cum-magic game that the books' characters play. And they have organized dozens of discussion groups.</p>
