        <p>STUDENTS think back-to-school time has all the charm of a finger in the eye, and who can blame them? No one, except by sword's point, would trade frittering away days for the nightly grind of homework. And those who work glamorous gigs like lifeguarding must rank swapping swimsuits for Bunsen burners as the world's worst transaction.</p>
        <p>But before the summer entirely unspools, let's consider Westchester students who work jobs that, well, are on the bottom of the summer job food chain. Does hopelessly awful employment ever scramble the equation, making summer curdle before Labor Day and turning school into something resembling a refuge?</p>
        <p>For answers, I toured the underbelly of the Westchester summer job scene. First stop, Sleepy Hollow Cemetery.</p>
        <p>Alfredo Martinez and Victor Sa, both college students and Croton-Harmon High School graduates, were spending their lunch break in a barn. Their job is to hand mow all the grass in the giant graveyard.</p>
        <p>''Mosquitoes,'' Mr. Martinez said with a wince, when asked what he thought of his work. ''And yellowjackets.''</p>
        <p>''One girlfriend I had a while ago,'' Mr. Sa chimed in, ''she thought I was crazy, crazy. Never wanted to visit here.''</p>
        <p>''They do get a little nervous,'' seconded Mr. Martinez, who says he never gets nervous, except when he arrives at work and sees candles arranged around graves. ''It's like a seance or something,'' he said, looking grim.</p>
        <p>With these hardships, I asked, You guys must be looking forward to leaving the graveyard for school, huh? The two suddenly turned silent, looking at me with disbelief.</p>
        <p>At Westchester Country Club, Kevin Quinn, a Rye High School senior, spent his summer in an ''armored golf cart.'' His job is to keep the driving range's 12,000 golf balls in constant play. He must drive his cart, which also sucks up golf balls, out onto the range. The whole time, balls are pelting his cart like minibombs.</p>
        <p>After he's filled the cart's belly with balls, he drives to a nearby shack and washes them. No sooner are they cleaned than the balls are given out and smacked back onto the range, where Mr. Quinn must withstand another bombardment to retrieve them. It looked like the swankiest setting ever for a Sisyphean task, but when I told Mr. Quinn that school might be more fun, he recoiled as if bit. ''Anything,'' he said, without a worm of doubt, ''is better than school.''</p>
        <p>With a snarl and hiss, a forklift hoists a knee-high pile of garbage and drops it into a Dumpster. A fog of dust rises from the Dumpster and mixes with the unforgiving humidity. Wiping sweat while driving the forklift is Liam O'Donovan, from Valhalla, who will be attending Marist College in the fall. His other task at Millwood Supply is to lug lumber by hand across the yard.</p>
        <p>''I like it; I just keep a rag around my head to keep cool,'' Mr. O'Donovan said, smiling in gentle disagreement when it is suggested that his job is so hot and backbreaking that he must be counting the hours until the most taxing thing he'll lift is a Lit 101 text.</p>
        <p>Outfitted in a dog-print smock, Jenna Leedy, a junior at Fox Lane High School in Mount Kisco, ''cleans up after'' the animals at Fine Animal Hospital in Bedford Hills. If anything can do the trick, emptying the chamber pots of cats and dogs must make the gravitational pull of school pretty strong, huh?</p>
        <p>''No,'' protested Ms. Leedy with iron-clad certainty. ''See, I get paid for this, and school . . . '' Her voice trailed off in a room where the barking of dogs was at cathedral-filling volume.</p>
        <p>Zecki Dossal, a Columbia University student from Scarsdale, who, in the name of birthday parties and corporate events, spent this summer, as he has the last five, zipped into Mickey Mouse, Winnie-the-Pooh and other costumes where ''the heat is unbearable,'' didn't want the summer to end either.</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. Dossal looks forward to doing the same next summer, pointing up the biggest common denominator among these workers. Heady from both having seen a difficult task to completion and earning their very own pocket change in the process, all these students were happy enough with their odd and gritty jobs to be considering a return next summer. All, that is, except one.</p>
        <p>That would be Mr. Martinez, from the graveyard. ''Next summer,'' he said, looking worn, ''I'll probably work in a car dealership.''</p>
