        <p>Here is what the Miami Hurricanes have lots of: quarterback-mauling defenders, speedy receivers, bruising running backs and, as always, confidence. The Canes work hard and are the kind of players that Coach Butch Davis likes.</p>
        <p>''I spend 85 to 90 hours a week at the office,'' Davis said. ''I don't want to spend all that time at work with players I don't like.''</p>
        <p>O.K., fine. Here is what Miami does not have: Michael Vick or a victory over Virginia Tech in six years.</p>
        <p>If Miami can conquer the Hokies and Vick, the left-handed quarterback who led Tech to last season's national championship game, on Nov. 4 at the Orange Bowl, the Hurricanes could be playing for something much more important than the Big East championship.</p>
        <p>But that is the biggest if of the conference season.</p>
        <p>Tech has had to replace most of its defense, plus its leading rusher, Shyrone Stith, but the Hokies have Vick. As a freshman last year, Vick proved that he could win games almost by himself. His scramble down the sideline set up the winning field goal in a 22-20 victory over West Virginia, the closest call the Hokies had during the regular season. In the Sugar Bowl, he rallied the Hokies from a three-touchdown deficit before they ran out of gas.</p>
        <p>Listed at 6 feet 1 inch and 214 pounds, Vick is said to be even bigger and faster than he was a year ago, when he led the nation in passing efficiency and finished third in the balloting for the Heisman Trophy. Tech Coach Frank Beamer said he had not had to worry that Vick, whose face might have been on almost as many magazine covers this summer as Jennifer Aniston's, would be overwhelmed by all the attention.</p>
        <p>''Sophomore jinx?'' Beamer said. ''I don't think that will be an issue.''</p>
        <p>Tech might have to rummage for some rushing yardage and will probably not hold six opponents to 10 points or fewer, as it did a year ago. But Vick presents matchup problems for every opponent on the Hokies' schedule.</p>
        <p>Miami has the type of team that can keep the ball away from Vick. The Hurricanes have a fleet of four good running backs, a young but talented quarterback in Ken Dorsey and receivers Santana Moss and Reggie Wayne. Miami won seven of its last eight games last season and scored at least 28 points in every game except the 43-10 loss Nov. 13 at Virginia Tech.</p>
        <p>The Hurricanes have already vowed that they will not make as many mistakes as they did in that game. ''You can't make mistakes against those guys,'' Wayne said. ''When we play them, the team that makes the most mistakes is going to lose the game.''</p>
        <p>And, probably, the conference championship.</p>
        <p>Davis said that this was the most balanced he had seen the Big East in his six years as Miami's head coach, but that is damning with faint praise. Though the other six teams in the conference will certainly be trying to trip up Tech and Miami, none appear to be deep or talented enough to make a serious run at the title.</p>
        <p>Duke Pettijohn, a senior defensive end, is the best player at Syracuse, which beat Kentucky in the Music City Bowl to partly atone for a disappointing season. Boston College has a good quarterback in the senior Tim Hasselbeck, who threw a 97-yard touchdown pass in a loss to Virginia Tech. Pittsburgh has secondary-stretching wide receivers in Latef Grim and Antonio Bryant. West Virginia's Avon Cobourne, just 5-8, led the Big East in rushing as a freshman, gaining 1,139 yards and averaging 5.4 yards a carry. Temple has a promising sophomore defensive tackle with good bloodlines, Dan Klecko, the son of the former Jet Joe Klecko. And Rutgers has quarterback Mike McMahon back after shoulder surgery, although he has been held out of some training camp workouts after reporting stiffness.</p>
        <p>But Temple and Rutgers will simply be trying to keep up, again. The Owls have won 15 games in the last 10 years. Rutgers has won eight games in the last four years. Both went out the same way last year -- with 55-0 losses to Miami. The goals for both Temple and Rutgers are, not surprisingly, modest.</p>
        <p>''There's no doubt we want to win more than we lose,'' Rutgers Coach Terry Shea said.</p>
        <p>Miami, meanwhile, has a loftier goal: winning the Big East championship. With that would come a berth in a big bowl game, and if the Canes can find a way to knock off both Tech and Florida State, the defending national champion, at home, they could be playing for the national title on Jan. 3 in the Orange Bowl at Pro Player Stadium in Miami, a long bus ride from campus.</p>
        <p>But the Hokies await.</p>
