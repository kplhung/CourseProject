        <p>Time Warner Trade Publishing is paying John F. Welch Jr., the chairman of the General Electric Company, $7.1 million for the rights to his story. This continues G.E.'s long tradition of bringing good literature to life.</p>
        <p>Congratulations on your purchase of the most reliable and dependable text appliance on the market today, the Portable John F. Welch Jr. Autobiography System (Model GE-TW-2000A). Please read instructions carefully before attempting to use this product. (Spanish Quick-Use Guide is included. Guia para rapida consulta en espanol esta includo.)</p>
        <p>Section 1. Installation.  After unpacking unit, make sure all parts are present. (See Fig. 1.)  (a) 8.5 x 7 Front Panel (BB-W3049) -- 1  (b) 8.5 x 7 Rear Panel (BB-W3094) -- 1  (c) 8.5 x 21 Exterior Dust Protection Display Sheath (BB-W30941) -- 1  (d) 8.5 x 7 Interior Print Text Sheets (BB-W4000-BB-W4434) -- 434</p>
        <p>If any part is missing or damaged, contact an authorized G.E./Time Warner service outlet or a trained G.E./Time Warner service technician. Do not attempt to remove panel and repair text yourself. CAUTION: USE OF UNAUTHORIZED REPLACEMENT TEXT MAY CAUSE BLURRED RECEPTION, SHOCK OR LIBEL SUIT.</p>
        <p>For optimum performance, avoid use outside during lightning storms or while operating a motor vehicle, power tool or cutting instrument. Store unit away from excessive water or moisture, such as in a kitchen sink or bathtub. If exposed to rain or moisture, leave unit OPEN and let dry. DO NOT PLACE IN EXTREME HEAT.</p>
        <p>Note: If unit is unused for an extended period of time, user may experience loss of interest.</p>
        <p>Section 2.  Manual Configuration.  (a) After inspection of parts (Section 1), locate Front Panel (BB-W3049) by holding center spinal quoin with both hands, positioning flat surface of Exterior Dust Protection Display Sheath (BB-W30941) so as to face user squarely, approximately 14-18 inches from eyes. (See Fig. 2.) CAUTION: DO NOT JAB EDGES OR CORNERS OF UNIT INTO EYES OR MOUTH. (FIRST AID: EYES -- Rinse with water for 15 minutes. IF SWALLOWED -- Harmful or fatal. Contact physician immediately.)  (b) Holding base of unit with unruffled edge to the left, rotate until the following text appears:</p>
        <p>By John F. Welch Jr.</p>
        <p>(Note: You may receive this error message</p>
        <p>If so, continue rotating until proper text appears.)</p>
        <p>You have configured the Front Panel (BB-W3049). You are now ready to operate!</p>
        <p>Section 3. Manual Operation.  (a) Holding unit securely, gently pry unhinged edge (right side) of Front Panel (BB-W3049) upward, lifting from body assembly and pulling in right-to-left motion, so as to form a V-shape (or inverted A without center bar).  (b) Holding base of unit, repeat (a) with Interior Print Text Sheet No. 1 (BB-W4000).  (c) Repeat in numerical (preferred) sequence. (For BROWSE and RANDOM MODE functions, see Page 49 of this manual.)</p>
        <p>Section 4. Mobility Operation (for G.E. employees and contractors).  (a) Mount unit on a flat surface, such as a coffee table or desktop, in area of high visibility.  (b) Refer to unit as ''best damn book I ever read!''  (c) Repeat (b) as needed. (For advanced users, consult Supplemental Manual (BB-W4), ''Getting the Most From This Product.'')</p>
        <p>Section 5. Trouble-Shooting.  Before requesting service on this unit, check the list below for a possible cause of the problem you are experiencing. Some simple checks or a minor adjustment on your part may restore proper operation.  Problem: All the words are upside down and backward.  Solution: Reconfiguration required. (See Section 2.)  Problem: I don't know what is happening in the story.  Solution: Return to last chapter you can remember.  Problem: Unit closes by itself.  Solution: With unit in ''open'' position (splayed A-shape), sit or stand on it squarely for 15-30 seconds until loud ''crack'' is heard. (See Fig. 3.)  (If problem persists, consider purchasing compatible Portable Book Marking Device GE-TW-2000B.)  Problem: I'm reading but don't hear anything.  Solution: See Page 56, ''Oral and/or Silent Text Processing.''  Problem: I have no more pages to turn.  Solution: Congratulations. You finished. Fortunately, the Portable John F. Welch Jr. Autobiography System (Model GE-TW-2000A) is reusable, so you can enjoy it again and again.</p>
        <p>CAUTION: PROLONGED USE MAY CAUSE DROWSINESS.</p>
