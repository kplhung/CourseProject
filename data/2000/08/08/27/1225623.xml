        <p>Nina Lauren Cloutier and John Bradley Gibson were married yesterday at the West Side Baptist Church on Block Island in Rhode Island. Richard Kiley, the first warden of the town of New Shoreham there, officiated.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Gibson, 35, is the international licensing manager for Ralph Lauren Home in New York. She graduated from Smith College. Her father, Norman Cloutier of Lynn, Mass., a retired architectural designer, had an office planning and design business in Montclair, N.J. Her mother, Lynne Cloutier of Westport, Conn., is a wedding planner there.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gibson, 42, is the director of school programming for the Mountain Workshop, an outdoor-education company in Ridgefield, Conn. He graduated from the University of California at Santa Barbara and is a candidate for a master's degree in Native American studies at Wesleyan University. His parents, Dorthea Gibson of Columbia, Mo., and the late Thomas Gibson, owned Kopper Key, a former women's clothing store in Columbia.</p>
        <p>The bride and the bridegroom met five years ago at a friend's Fourth of July party. Mr. Gibson said he noted ''something in her smile and the glint in her eye that told me she was someone interesting to talk to.'' They talked the entire evening and into the next morning -- on the beach, at a local bar -- and found they had much in common, with enough contrast to make things interesting.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gibson recalled the exact moment he decided to marry Ms. Cloutier. It was in summer 1999, standing in the backyard of his apartment building in Bridgeport, Conn.</p>
        <p>''I was looking up at all these little decks that were sterile and empty and not very attractive, except for one, which was mine,'' he remembered. ''There was a profusion of color and life from flowers in bloom that Nina had made happen.'' He added, ''That really showed me the kind of person she is, and how she makes my life better.''</p>
