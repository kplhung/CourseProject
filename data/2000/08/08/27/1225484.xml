        <p>THE capacious galleries at Real Art Ways in Hartford seem haunted these days. Two of the three summer shows are about ghosts from the past, while the third is overrun by wee folk.</p>
        <p>One of the shows has the matter-of-fact title ''Exhibition Room.'' It's called that because it's meant to conjure up a museum stocked with artifacts. Three artists, paradoxically, have made fresh objects intended to resonate with ones from bygone eras. It is standard for museums to have period rooms full of furniture, and the British sculptor Francis Cape refers to that with his meticulously crafted cabinets and chests that have the aura of coming from colonial days in America.</p>
        <p>The items, four cabinets and one chest, are imposing; one of the cabinets is 10 feet high and 13 feet wide. The cabinets seem to have doors: the facades of the pieces are incised as if doors are there, but they lack handles or knobs and the supposed doors can't be pried open with one's fingers.</p>
        <p>Josiah McElheny is a glass blower, but he is content to be a simple artisan. Rather he might call himself a conceptual craftsman. One of his pieces is a clear plate flecked with gold stars. Displayed next to it is a reproduction of the Virgin Mary by Botticelli with a halo similar to Mr. McElheny's fabrication. The most ambitious of his pieces is a line up of 13 rather plain glass cups based on those in da Vinci's painting of the Last Supper contrasted with a row of varied cups that are of thicker glass and subtly colored.</p>
        <p>In wall information, Mr. McElheny says that the latter vessels are closer to those that might have been used in Palestine in Jesus' time. Yinka Shonibare is listed as being American and Nigerian and a dual heritage is the crux of her art. She makes items of clothing belonging to Europe and America out of colorful and complex patterned cloth that is distinctly African.</p>
        <p>One item is a 19th-century woman's bonnet that originally would have been made out of fabric of a single subdued color. Two small mannequins wear clothes of African cloth but based on ones worn by the 19th-century Prime Ministers Benjamin Disraeli and William Gladstone, who presided over the British Empire at its height. These works are politically loaded, and effective because nothing more is done with them.</p>
        <p>When she tries for something more complicated, the impact is lessened: ''Diary of a Victorian Dandy'' is a large color photograph that has a nattily dressed black man in a book-lined room among more conservatively dressed men with pink skin who seem to be making fun of him. In wall information, Ms. Shonibare attempts a labored exegesis of her picture's meaning.</p>
        <p>Peter Edlund appropriates a powerful era in American culture with his remakes of grandiose Hudson River School Paintings. The title of the show featuring four of his paintings is ''Majestic America'' and he means it with a dose of sarcasm.</p>
        <p>His versions of paintings by Albert Bierstadt, Frederick Church and Asher B. Durand from the collection of the Wadsworth Atheneum contain episodes of murder, rape and other degradation of minorities in America's pursuit of Manifest Destiny.</p>
        <p>Mr. Edlund's paintings are in grisaille but with a monochromatic layer of luridly irradiated color over the compositions. Through this coloration, the widespread ruination of America's Edenic environment, celebrated in the mid-19th century, is commented on, too. A small reproduction of the original painting is hung next to each of Mr. Edlund's remakes. Lofty art historical text is appended to the reproduction, while the appropriate horror occurring, usually incidentally, in each painting is explained next to the Edlund versions.</p>
        <p>Sandwiched between the galleries containing the shows discussed above is an installation meant to be very much in the routine present: ''Don't Forget the Lunches . . .'' If not a celebration, it at least monumentalizes the ritual of a mother packing lunches for her school-age children. The artist Monica Bock provides plenty of proof to make the point that while packing two lunches every day may not seem that laborious, those lunches add up.</p>
        <p>A mother is another species of fabricator, says Ms. Bock through the nearly 400 brown bags made out of lead sheet that represent a year's worth of actual lunches prepared for her two children to take to school or day camp. These bags are lined up in rows like a well-organized army. A large number of similar bags, but made out of glycerin in various degrees of orange, join the lead bags but these are exhibited in disarray.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bock's intention might be to match the rambunctiousness of her tow-headed pair whom the audience sees via a video projected at a jaunty angle in the wall in front of the bags.</p>
        <p>Although viewers can hardly make out the writing, and it would take stepping gingerly between the rows of bags, each bag is embossed with the menu of food it putatively contained. The sheer energy expended to give this mundane activity its moment is remarkable and itself an indicator of maternal devotion.</p>
        <p>Well enough should have been left alone, but what is obligatory these days, a political overlay impenetrable in its own way, is on the wall -- but in small type. And the artist doesn't forget to mention the potential health hazards of lead.</p>
        <p>''Three Summer Shows'' is at Real Art Ways, Hartford, through Sept. 10.</p>
