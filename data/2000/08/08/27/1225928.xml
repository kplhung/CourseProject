        <p>SCHWARTZBERG-Jack. An advocate for liquor salesmen and distillery workers, died August 24, 2000 at the Hallendale Rehabilitation Center. He was 90. A labor leader and champion of workers' rights, Mr. Schwartzberg served 25 years as Vice President of the International Distillery Wine and Allied Workers' Union. He was also a member of the Executive Board of Local 2 of the Liquor Salesmen's Union, where he sponsored incentives to help distillery workers &amp; salesmen. Born in a farmhouse in Manchester, CT. of immigrant parents from what was then Palestine, Jack spent the early part of his life with five brothers and two sisters, attending a one room schoolhouse, and raising prize winning grapes and dairy cattle. In 1929, he left the family farm to move to New York, where he worked as a welder and master sheet metal craftsman. In the years prior to WWII, while working with his hands during the day, Jack donated his evenings teaching mechanical drafting at New York's Mechanics Institute. During the War, he mobilized and ran Brooklyn's Hercules Sheet Metal Factory, which produced most of the first aid kits and cooking utencils supplied to U.S. servicemen in the field. He is survived by son Paul J. Sutton of Manhattan, Neil Schwartzberg of Hollywood, FL, daughter Nancy Miller of Baltimore, brothers Morris and Pat, grandchildren Daniel and Lily Sutton, daughter-in-law Edith Bers Sutton, and a large family in Israel. The family requests that, in lieu of flowers or gifts, a contribution in memory of Jack be made to the not-for-profit Beacon College, 105 East Main St., Leesburg, FL 34748. Funeral service at Riverside-Gordon Memorial Chapel, 1PM Sunday, August 27, 2230 Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood, FL 33020.</p>
