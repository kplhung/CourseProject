        <p>RENAISSANCE cartographers fashioned maps of the world -- even though few ever ventured beyond their studios. How indeed did they do this?</p>
        <p>In ''Earth's Illusive Shores: The Art of Mapping After 1500'' -- an exhibition on view through Oct. 1 at the Bruce Museum of Arts and Science in Greenwich -- more than 40 antique maps and sea charts, most hand-colored woodcuts or engravings dating from after 1520, demonstrate the sometimes eccentric shaping of continents and seas by cartographers and publishers.</p>
        <p>The maps are part of the private collection of Jack A. Somer, a Greenwich resident, former editor of Yachting Magazine, a marine writer, world-class sailor and map collector. ''I've always had a fascination for maps and from the 60's was a professional yacht captain on sailing vessels for a dozen years,'' said Mr. Somer. ''What's key to the show is that when you're in the middle of the ocean and see only sky and ocean, the only connection to the rest of the world is your navigating chart. During those years I found some errors on American nautical charts and became interested in the process of map making and in buying antique nautical charts.''</p>
        <p>On view are maps covering the known world in general, the American continents in particular, some of the seven seas, a few unrecognizable lands, and some wholly invented ones. They illustrate the state of global cartography, following the voyages of Christopher Columbus, and successive explorers.</p>
        <p>''After 1492, the art of mapping experienced a renaissance,'' Mr. Somer said, ''as the explosion of New World information created an ever-changing view of the Earth for sailors, merchants, historians, philosophers, scholars and kings.''</p>
        <p>The maps and charts of the newly discovered Americas reveal an imaginative application of New World data. ''California,'' Mr. Somer said, ''is seen charted as an island -- commonly interpreted as one until well into the 1700's.''</p>
        <p>The maps are reminders of how hungry early publishers were for information from shipmasters to explorers including the naturalists and clerics who accompanied them. ''Cartographers were quick to apply the latest information, however sketchy, even rumors, before going to press,'' Mr. Somer said. ''So the maps, minus the luxury of fact-checking, are a blend of accuracy and fancy.''</p>
        <p>Modern cartography had roots in the early 15th century's revival of the theories of Claudius Ptolemy, the second-century Greek geographer who conceived of locating regions by their latitude and longitude. ''The Ptolemaic revival coincided with advances in printing,'' Mr. Somer said. ''And by the mid-1400's a new industry of publishing was born, producing bound books of geography, cosmology, history and exploration.''</p>
        <p>There are 43 framed printed objects, two which are not maps and displayed under the category ''Oddities'' -- because they are just that. A circa-1552 woodcut by Sebastian Munster is a catalog of invented sea monsters with religious undertones. And a circa-1650 engraving by Jan Jansson is a chart of 32 winds (early sailors navigated by them) in six languages in the form of a circular diagram. Every wind is blown by a person, young or old, white or black, in this superb work of art.</p>
        <p>The show is arranged so every map is paired with another to make some historic, geographic or artistic point. ''I want people to come away learning something, not just looking at pretty pictures,'' said Mr. Somer who will be at the museum to give a lecture at 3 p.m. on Sept. 10.</p>
        <p>The Bruce Museum (One Museum Drive, Greenwich, 203-869-0376) is open Tuesday through Saturday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday 1 to 5 p.m.</p>
