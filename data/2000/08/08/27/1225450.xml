        <p>1. Jay Chiat is best known as a founder of Chiat/Day, the advertising agency that brought you the Energizer Bunny and the Apple ''1984'' commercial. He also commissioned Frank Gehry to design the agency's Santa Monica headquarters, shown here, with its Claes Oldenburg binoculars. Chiat sold the agency six years ago and is now the chairman of Screaming Media, a company that distributes custom content to Web sites.</p>
        <p>2. Edwina von Gal's plant-based landscapes can be found from California to the Caribbean, for clients as stellar as Mike Nichols and Harvey Weinstein. Her work can be abstract and conceptual, like the landscape she designed for the house she shares with Chiat, or it can be downright lush, like the Southampton garden shown here.</p>

        <p>1. Jay Chiat is best known as a founder of Chiat/Day, the advertising agency that brought you the Energizer Bunny and the Apple ''1984'' commercial. He also commissioned Frank Gehry to design the agency's Santa Monica headquarters, shown here, with its Claes Oldenburg binoculars. Chiat sold the agency six years ago and is now the chairman of Screaming Media, a company that distributes custom content to Web sites.</p>
        <p>2. Edwina von Gal's plant-based landscapes can be found from California to the Caribbean, for clients as stellar as Mike Nichols and Harvey Weinstein. Her work can be abstract and conceptual, like the landscape she designed for the house she shares with Chiat, or it can be downright lush, like the Southampton garden shown here.</p>
        <p>3. Those gracefully gnarly-looking trees outside the Chiat-von Gal house are shad bushes, so named because they bloom in the spring when the shad are running. They are plentiful along eastern Long Island's Napeague strip, which is now being heavily developed. Wild shads are highly prized, and rescuing and transplanting them has become quite an industry, with trees fetching into the five figures. To buy one, call Bob Pucci at Whitmores: (631) 329-0446.</p>
        <p>4. While photographing the house, the crew got lunch from the Sagg Main Store in Sagaponack (631) 537-6036. The secret ingredient in the delicious $31.95-a-pound lobster salad? ''It's going to remain a secret,'' says Bob Baugh, who owns the store with his family. Braugh moved East from ''a redneck town in Oregon'' only five years ago. But he learned quickly how to keep his celebrity clientele happy: he won't divulge a thing.</p>
        <p>5. After asking Hut Sachs Studio to design his house, Chiat asked the 6-year-old,10-person firm to do the Screaming Media offices, pictured below, in downtown Manhattan. Thomas Hut was a consultant on the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, and Jane Sachs was a ceramicist before going to architecture school in the late 1980's.</p>
        <p>6. The Barn People of Windsor, Vt., specialize in locating, disassembling and reassembling old barn structures. Chiat and von Gal's is a three-bay, English-style hay barn, one of the most popular (and priciest) models because it lends itself well to residential conversion, either as a ''great room'' or as multilevel living spaces. (802) 674-5898 or www.thebarnpeople.com.</p>
        <p>7. The big garage doors in the living area are made by Arm-R-Lite, a company founded in 1958 and based in South Plainfield, N.J. Arm-R-Lite's specialty is ''aluminum overhead sectional doors,'' commonly used in places like fire stations and shopping malls; more adventurous architects, like Hut Sachs or Barton Myers (whose own place is shown here) use them in houses. (800) 554-5816.</p>
        <p>8. Jay Chiat's art collection reflects his current interest in younger artists; there are two Damien Hirsts in the house, including a yellow version of this butterfly painting, and a John Currin in the master bathroom. Chiat also collects the work of his weekend neighbors on Long Island -- David Salle, Bryan Hunt, April Gornik and Eric Fischl -- as well as that of California-based artists like Charles Arnoldi, Ed Ruscha and Charles Ray. Chiat explains that he started out as a minimalist, buying works by Carl Andre and Ellsworth Kelly, but is now interested in ''things that are more conceptual.''</p>
        <p>9. The kitchen is dotted with aluminum architect lamps that shed light on the stove and other work areas. Designed by Michele De Lucchi and Giancarlo Fassina for Artemide, the Tolomeo lamp, with its rotatable head and arms, is a modern design icon. Last year, the company brought out its smallest Tolomeo model, the Micro, which is perfect for bedside tables and bookcases. $250 at Artemide, 46 Greene Street.</p>
