        <p>There's a reason Rusty Wallace considers Bristol Motor Speedway in Bristol, Tenn., his favorite track. No one can beat him there.</p>
        <p>Wallace became the first four-time winner of the season last night when he easily won NACAR's goracing.com. The victory gave him a season-sweep on the 0.533-mile bullring -- the first driver to pull off the feat since Dale Carnhardt did it in 1987 -- and his ninth career victory at the track.</p>

        <p>Wallace, also the winner last week at Michigan, is the first driver this season to win in consecutive weeks.</p>
        <p>More importantly, he closed the gap in the race for the Winston Cup championship. Wallace came into the race in fifth place in the standings, 352 points behind the leader Bobby Labonte. He remained in fifth after the victory, but closed the gap to 290 points.</p>
