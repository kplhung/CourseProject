        <p>JOURNALISM is no glamour biz. Bad hours, peanut pay. Unflattering lighting. Or so the inmates complain. As for the style sense -- does the word ''shlubby'' mean anything to you? The women are more presentable. The men? Let's just say Dockers and Rockport are their Gucci and Prada.</p>
        <p>So, yes, the September issue of W magazine's 16-page men's fashion spread is somewhat jarring. There's Joel Stein, Time's nerdy humor boy, in a black corduroy Tommy Hilfiger suit, and Kurt Andersen, the unironed magazine veteran and co-founder of Inside.com, in Armani, among other working journalists. The headline? ''Medium Cool.''</p>

        <p>JOURNALISM is no glamour biz. Bad hours, peanut pay. Unflattering lighting. Or so the inmates complain. As for the style sense -- does the word ''shlubby'' mean anything to you? The women are more presentable. The men? Let's just say Dockers and Rockport are their Gucci and Prada.</p>
        <p>So, yes, the September issue of W magazine's 16-page men's fashion spread is somewhat jarring. There's Joel Stein, Time's nerdy humor boy, in a black corduroy Tommy Hilfiger suit, and Kurt Andersen, the unironed magazine veteran and co-founder of Inside.com, in Armani, among other working journalists. The headline? ''Medium Cool.''</p>
        <p>A few gallons of Wite-Out are being applied to the old ink-stained-wretch cliche. NBC has a new fall series called ''Deadline,'' about a dapper columnist who solves crimes in his spare time. Cameron Crowe, in his movie ''Almost Famous,'' opening Sept. 15, recounts his days as a 15-year-old Rolling Stone writer during an era when rock journalists could still pretend to be almost as cool as their subjects. And in the pipeline, there's ''Serendipity,'' which began filming in New York last week, and may be the first movie in which the dramatis personae include an obituary writer for The New York Times.</p>
        <p>Not since Redford and Hoffman played a better-looking Woodward and Bernstein has the profession been made to look so cool. This development raises important questions like, Is the Fourth Estate experiencing a rehabilitation? And, What are the three other estates, anyway?</p>
        <p>But those are matters to be debated in The Columbia Journalism Review. The issue raised by the W spread and this wave of movies and television shows is that dressing up the image of journalists requires careful thought about what they're going to be dressed up in. As Marcus Teo, the men's fashion editor at W, explained: ''These are behind-the-scenes people not known for having much of a clue about style or fashion. We wanted to turn the rumpled into the fabulous.''</p>
        <p>Fabulous isn't quite the word for Oliver Platt, the Falstaffian character actor who plays Wallace Benton, the crusading hero of ''Deadline.'' But he certainly looks distinguished in bow tie, double-breasted blazer and flamboyantly draped scarf. Dick Wolf, the show's creator and one of its executive producers, places Benton ''in the tradition of Jimmy Breslin and Mike McAlary.'' Except that Mr. Breslin isn't a bow tie type, nor was the late Mr. McAlary.</p>
        <p>Benton's wardrobe is more ''Paper Chase'' than ''Lou Grant,'' maybe to remind viewers of his professorial duties, teaching journalism to a class of eager cub reporters. The crime-solving part of the show is done with the aid of his students in their joint quest for ''nothing but the truth.''</p>
        <p>Coincidentally, Mr. Platt's brother, Adam Platt, is a journalist (a restaurant critic for New York magazine). To get into character, the actor brother spent time researching the writer brother's milieu. He visited a newsroom, lunched with reporters at the Four Seasons and -- more in keeping with the stereotype -- sought out free booze at open-bar parties.</p>
        <p>Mr. Crowe's movie has even more personal significance: it's autobiography. Before he wrote movies, Mr. Crowe wrote magazine articles. At the prodigious age of 15, he was assigned a story by an editor at Rolling Stone who had no idea that the kid on the other end of the phone actually was a kid.</p>
        <p>The movie is loosely based on the callow Mr. Crowe's experiences following bands around and writing about them, even though he wasn't much older than their youngest fans. The boy wonder sees it all: drugs, sex, stupid arguments between the guitarist and the lead singer.</p>
        <p>And check out the crazy threads! William, the Crowe character, dresses pretty much like 15-year-olds dressed in 1973. Sneakers, T-shirt, ungainly satchel. But when he calls Rolling Stone's offices, there's a glimpse of his grown-up counterparts: editors in Op Art polyester shirts and tinted glasses, brandishing cigarette holders. Even the magazine's founder, Jann Wenner -- well, a young actor playing him -- is there, looking in his pinstriped shirt and hip-huggers like something out of a Tommy Hilfiger campaign. When this movie comes out, the magazine may be deluged with internship applications.</p>
        <p>William's idol and role model is Lester Bangs, the late rock critic and gonzo editor of Creem magazine. ''Be truthful and unmerciful,'' Bangs counsels his would-be protege. And a total slob, he might have added. The Bangs look, and worldview, were pure antichic: droopy jeans, Guess Who T-shirt and a beat-up motorcycle jacket.</p>
        <p>''I made that T-shirt,'' said Betsy Heimann, the film's costume designer. ''That's the only way I could be true to the silhouette.'' The silhouette of the 70's being form-fitting -- no matter how fit the form. (And Bangs, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, was not buff.)</p>
        <p>For the others, Ms. Heimann worked from photographs of the staff in the Rolling Stone archive. The fictional band in the movie represents the post-hippie, pre-glam country rock interregnum of the Eagles, the Allman Brothers, Lynyrd Skynyrd. ''The American rock star as cowboy outlaw,'' as Ms. Heimann encapsulated it.</p>
        <p>It was a look many rock critics kept alive well past its, and their, prime. As Robert Palmer once wrote in The New York Times, you could always tell the rock critic in a punk or new wave club, because he was the only one with long hair. For years, Dan Aquilante's column in The New York Post had the quintessential rock critic photo byline: a tiny head encased in the world's largest set of headphones.</p>
        <p>Rock critics may have been ripe for some image rehab, but if ever there was an unlikely beat to be hipified it is that of the obituary writer. Jeremy Piven, 35, plays the obit writer and best friend in ''Serendipity,'' a romantic comedy with John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale due to open early next year. The film's original (since departed) costume person presented Mr. Piven with a get-up that he felt was a little on the cliched side.</p>
        <p>''I didn't want to have patches on my elbows, you know?'' he said last week, looking around L'Uomo, a men's clothing store on Bleecker Street. Asked to pick out a few items a typical obituary writer would wear, he rejected most of the stuff as too expensive.</p>
        <p>Mr. Piven said he imagined his character as an aspiring novelist (accurate) who worshiped Hemingway (accurate) and therefore might wear a guayabera shirt because Hem would have worn one in Cuba ''with a light spring jacket over it'' (iffy).</p>
        <p>At 'ino, a tiny restaurant across  Bedford Street from the apartment where he was staying, he reflected on his own brushes with journalism. Mr. Piven has been in 35 movies, most recently ''The Crew'' (which opened Friday) and has done his share of television work (''The Larry Sanders Show,'' ''Ellen''). But his name is known only to a small cult of fans. This he blames in part on the press and his own disinclination to seek it out, as well as a former publicist who advised him to wear berets on talk shows.</p>
        <p>''In Hollywood, they know the press is bought and paid for, but they still believe the hype,'' he said. As for entertainment reporters, ''they'll take a quote and twist it up, so they can put it out there and sell papers.'' But that's just his opinion. For a guy like his character in the movie, ''who went to Brown and worshiped Hemingway, he would be more romantic about it,'' Mr. Piven said. The Cusack character's best friend, he added, would not be ''a sellout punk.''</p>
        <p>The fashion-forward W magazine shoot notwithstanding, what this crop of fictional journalists have in common is nostalgia. ''Deadline'' romanticizes a mostly bygone era when columnists were feisty characters with personalities as big as their circulation. Described in NBC's promotional tape as ''a new breed of journalist,'' Wallace Benton seems more like the last of a dying one.</p>
        <p>''Almost Famous'' wistfully recreates the bygone era of unlimited access to the bands and stars of the day. Now, rock reporters prescreened by publicists feel lucky to score an hour in a hotel room with their subjects. And ''Serendipity''? We'll see when it comes out, but at least we know the Piven obit writer gets to pal around with John Cusack.</p>
        <p>The danger, of course, is that actual journalists might start believing their press. That they might actually start wearing fur-collared coats. They would do well to keep in mind Lester Bangs's words of wisdom to his naive acolyte. ''You are not cool,'' he tells him.</p>
        <p>Not even medium.</p>
