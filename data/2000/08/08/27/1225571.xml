        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In his article ''Students Get a Taste of Acting's Raw Power'' [Aug. 20], Lawrence Sacharow distinguishes Jerzy Grotowski -- a ''true teacher'' who ''guides students'' -- from ''ego-driven gurus'' who attract followers by the dint of their charisma, out of which usually appears a ''rigidified technique or formula to emulate.'' But most great teachers promote a technique that students emulate; Grotowski was hardly an exception. His technique of physical action was influenced by Stanislavsky's work on physical action in the 1930's, which was driven in part by Stalin's ideologically enforced expulsion of psychology, subjectivity, and individuality in all aesthetic training and production.</p>

        <p>The formulaic method of physical action espoused by Grotowski and his protege, Thomas Richards, gained its reputation through the inspiration and charisma of Grotowski, as well as its successful application to certain theatrical material. It is not, however, useful for all theatrical work and like most rigidified techniques can be used or not depending on the play, situation, director or other factors.</p>
