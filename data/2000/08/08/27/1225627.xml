        <p>Saying its quarters at Westchester County Airport in Harrison are too small for its corporate fleet of aircraft, the General Electric Company plans to lease about 11 acres at Stewart International Airport in Newburgh, Jeff DeMarrais, a spokesman for the company, said.</p>
        <p>G.E.'s plan is to sublease the hangar it occupies in Harrison and build a $24 million, 95,000-square-foot-complex in Newburgh. The move would represent a loss of 80 jobs for Westchester.</p>

        <p>Saying its quarters at Westchester County Airport in Harrison are too small for its corporate fleet of aircraft, the General Electric Company plans to lease about 11 acres at Stewart International Airport in Newburgh, Jeff DeMarrais, a spokesman for the company, said.</p>
        <p>G.E.'s plan is to sublease the hangar it occupies in Harrison and build a $24 million, 95,000-square-foot-complex in Newburgh. The move would represent a loss of 80 jobs for Westchester.</p>
        <p>The company wanted to build a 70,000-square-foot hangar to house business jets at the Westchester site, but its plans were thwarted by environmentalists who said de-icing fluids and other pollutants could threaten the Kensico Reservoir.</p>
        <p>A year ago, G.E. agreed to a five-year lease to remain in Westchester, paying the county $53,300 a month in the first three years. After that, it was to have the option of paying either market value or $58,097 a month.</p>
