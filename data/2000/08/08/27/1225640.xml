        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I just finished reading ''The Life and Times of a Pool in Scarsdale'' [Aug. 20]. As an ardent swimmer, I rejoice for Arnold Davis for continuing his daily pool swims so devotedly. However, I sense such a profound sadness on the part of Arnold and his wife that their beautiful pool is not appreciated nor enjoyed by their children and grandchildren.</p>
        <p>May I humbly suggest that the Davises open up their imaginations and hearts and consider hosting several afternoon pool swims for five or so inner-city youngsters. To watch these children experience what Arnold Davis calls that ''good clean feeling in it compared to public pools'' might even inspire him to dust off those teaching skills he honed so long ago at the Lenox Hill</p>

        <p>Neighborhood House pool.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Davis might even be inspired to dig out the ''bags of rubber balls, straw hats and old floats from the musty shed.'' Everything can still be here, including ''the excited shouts of children in dripping bathing suits.''</p>
        <p>I have a hunch that this kind of endeavor might even be of more than  casual interest to the Davises' progeny.</p>
