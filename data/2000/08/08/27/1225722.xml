        <p>Robert Shapiro was explaining the connection between the two seemingly unrelated enterprises he runs from his crowded storefront on East Fourth Street: a T-shirt design company and the city's premier, which is to say only, shelter for homeless reptiles.</p>
        <p>''There is, believe it or not, and though it may not be initially noticeable,'' he said, ''a consistency in what we do. Uh oh.''</p>

        <p>Robert Shapiro was explaining the connection between the two seemingly unrelated enterprises he runs from his crowded storefront on East Fourth Street: a T-shirt design company and the city's premier, which is to say only, shelter for homeless reptiles.</p>
        <p>''There is, believe it or not, and though it may not be initially noticeable,'' he said, ''a consistency in what we do. Uh oh.''</p>
        <p>A small accident.</p>
        <p>It was Boone, a cute shepherd-collie pup that, like all the animals in Mr. Shapiro's menagerie, was waiting to be adopted. Not to worry. Mr. Shapiro, 43 and lanky with curly black hair, cleaned the sidewalk, and everything returned to normal.</p>
        <p>The urban-planning visionary Jane Jacobs said neighborhoods thrived when people watched the streets. Even better than people, it would seem, is a cage full of iguanas. They bask in front of Mr. Shapiro's store, Social Tees, on East Fourth Street between First and Second Avenues, and the whole world, human and animal, revolves around them.</p>
        <p>Passers-by with dogs, some of them alumni of the shelter, stop for a sniff. One afternoon, a woman freighted with shopping bags came to visit one of her favorites. ''Let's see if he remembers me from yesterday,'' she said. ''Awww, you guys are little sweethearts. You're so good. Look at your green spots! Look, he remembers me!''</p>
        <p>Possession of iguanas, and dozens of other reptiles, was outlawed last year by the city, but Mr. Shapiro has permission from the Health Department to keep them while he tries to find out-of-town takers.</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. Shapiro often serves as the city's semi-official reptile foster parent. In June, when a sickly juvenile alligator turned up abandoned in the creek that runs through Historic Richmondtown on Staten Island, the police called Mr. Shapiro, who coached them over the telephone on how to apprehend it with lasso and tape and take it to him for first aid.</p>
        <p>The store, which he moved into last fall from a smaller one in the Village, consists of three small rooms given over mostly to boxes and tanks and cages containing animals. He keeps the animals only until he finds homes for them.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, Mr. Shapiro's collection numbered 97, including a dozen iguanas, 8 cats, 4 kittens, 5 ball pythons, 5 boa constrictors (including a pregnant one), 4 California king snakes, 4 pit bulls, 2 bearded dragons, 2 corn snakes, 2 parakeets, a snapping turtle, an Egyptian spiny-tailed lizard and 45 newborn baby Burmese pythons, ''some normal, some albino.''</p>
        <p>Up on the walls are about 150 of his T-shirt designs, with pithy sayings attacking social ills, in handwritten white on black, chalkboard style. ''The meaning of life is to give life meaning.'' ''Homophobia: insecurity about being heterosexual.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Shapiro, a complicated guy, easygoing and open but with an edge, started out as a painter but switched to T-shirts in the early 90's. His first big seller said, ''No, white lady. I don't want your purse.'' The most famous one, frequently appropriated by others, he says, has the words black, white, red, yellow and brown all crossed out, and below them, human in capital letters.</p>
        <p>He sells the shirts wholesale to school groups, who sell them to raise money, and plows much of the profits into caring for strays and shipping them to good homes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shapiro finally explained the conceptual link between his two businesses: ''We champion the misunderstood. It's true! My shirts are about issues that are misunderstood in the world, and we rescue the most misunderstood of the animal kingdom. Oh, and I'm very misunderstood too.''</p>
