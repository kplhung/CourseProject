        <p>After accusing Egypt of undermining the Camp David summit meeting, the Clinton administration is now focusing on the Egyptian leader, Hosni Mubarak, as a key to finding a solution in the Middle East, particularly on the future status of Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>President Clinton is scheduled to see Mr. Mubarak in Cairo on Tuesday, and will be working on ideas on the Jerusalem problem, as well as the broader settlement between the Israelis and the Palestinians, a senior administration official said.</p>
        <p>''Getting the Egyptians involved is key, and they want to be involved,'' the official said.</p>
        <p>After arriving in Nigeria today, President Clinton, responding to questions, said he did not anticipate that his meeting with Mr. Mubarak would yield a breakthrough, but said it was ''inconceivable'' to pursue peace in the region without his support.</p>
        <p>The courting of the Egyptian leader as a central figure in the peace effort comes as a last round of diplomacy unfolds before time vanishes for a Middle East deal. The White House and the Israelis view the end of September as effectively the last moment for reconvening a Camp David-style summit meeting.</p>
        <p>''We are working with a sense of urgency, given the timetable the parties have set for themselves,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''And we don't underestimate the continuing difficulties, but I'm pleased they're still working.''</p>
        <p>By the end of September, the precarious political position of the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, could worsen, and the onset of Jewish religious holidays, which run from late September into much of October, will make negotiations more complicated. Negotiators say it will be more difficult for Mr. Clinton to be the heavyweight mediator once the American presidential campaign is in its final weeks.</p>
        <p>In addition, the White House has said that Mr. Clinton would consider another summit meeting only if the gaps between the parties were small and there was little risk of failure. After meeting with Mr. Barak, and the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, in New York next month at the United Nations' Millennium Summit, Mr. Clinton expects to have a better idea whether a new Mideast meeting would be worthwhile, his aides said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat arrived in Cairo today to see Mr. Mubarak for a meeting in which the administration hopes the Egyptian leader will lend him some cover for compromise on Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>''Jerusalem is one issue Arafat cannot act alone on,'' the administration official said.</p>
        <p>During the Camp David meeting last month, Mr. Arafat insisted that East Jerusalem must be the capital of a Palestinian state. He rejected proposals for shared sovereignty between Israelis and Palestinians over the most contentious site, Temple Mount, known by Muslims as Haram al Sharif.</p>
        <p>The very notion of negotiating over how to share sovereignty in East Jerusalem is a high-wire act for Arab leaders -- especially Mr. Mubarak -- who have long feared major opposition to such a deal.</p>
        <p>Israelis said they were pleased that the Clinton administration had brought Egypt onto the stage. ''Everyone knows that Egypt is key in giving Arafat a feeling that there is a milieu out there for an agreement,'' an Israeli official said.</p>
        <p>After the senior Israeli negotiator, Shlomo Ben-Ami, met with the Egyptians in Alexandria on Thursday, the Egyptian foreign minister, Amr Moussa, said the idea of ''shared sovereignty'' was a ''departure from international law, and Egypt cannot agree to that.''</p>
        <p>He said Egypt ''is not negotiating with the Israelis over the Palestinians, but trying to deal with the Israeli position and bring it back to international law.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Moussa was quoted by Mr. Ben-Ami as offering an idea of ''postponed sovereignty'' for the Temple Mount.</p>
        <p>The administration official said it still remained the preference of the White House to wrap up a deal that included all the elements of disagreement between Palestinians and Israelis -- Jerusalem, the fate of refugees, the borders of a new Palestinian state, and security issues.</p>
        <p>Immediately after the Camp David meeting broke down last month, a close aide to President Clinton attacked Mr. Mubarak for flying to see the royal family of Saudi Arabia during the last days of the meeting and sending signals that a compromise on Jerusalem by Mr. Arafat would be unacceptable.</p>
        <p>But the White House also appeared to recognize that it had not done enough preparatory diplomacy with Arab leaders before the meeting.</p>
        <p>''There is now a general assessment that there was a technical blunder by the administration in not properly consulting the Egyptians before Camp David went sour,'' a senior Middle East diplomat said.</p>
