        <p>Like many elite New Yorkers, trout are picky about their surroundings. Unlike carp, which can thrive in the liquid murk of the urban waterway, trout need a cold, clear stream from a pristine source. No wonder that biologists say wild brook trout have not been seen in the city for 100  years or more.</p>
        <p>But scientists and volunteers with a private conservation group think they may have found a spot in Alley Pond Park where trout can live: the East and West branches of Alley Creek.

        <p>Like many elite New Yorkers, trout are picky about their surroundings. Unlike carp, which can thrive in the liquid murk of the urban waterway, trout need a cold, clear stream from a pristine source. No wonder that biologists say wild brook trout have not been seen in the city for 100  years or more.</p>
        <p>But scientists and volunteers with a private conservation group think they may have found a spot in Alley Pond Park where trout can live: the East and West branches of Alley Creek. The first issues from an underground spring, and the second flows from Alley Pond, on city parkland near the Long Island Expressway and Cross Island Parkway.</p>
        <p>The scientists and volunteers are conducting a yearlong study, which began in May, with $9,000 in grants acquired by the New York City chapter of Trout Unlimited, a national conservation group. They are monitoring Alley Creek for trout-friendly conditions, which, if found throughout the year, will lead to the release of about 200 of the fish into the creek in 2001 or 2002.</p>
        <p>Wayne Tusa, an environmental consultant working on the project, said the early data looked promising,  meaning the water was cold and clear and swarming with favorite trout foods like mayflies and midges.</p>
        <p>In the spring of 1998, the group released 200 two- and three-inch trout into the creek, then checked on them six months later. They found that many of the fish measured six to eight inches -- an impressive amount of growth. But eight months later, none were left.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tusa said this showed that the creek could most likely support trout in the short term, but might have environmental barriers to long life. He speculated on the disappearance of the first 200 fish: ''It literally could have been two herons feeding in the stream for a week.'' Should that prove to be the case, he said, the group could do something as simple as putting boards across the creek at points as a refuge from birds of prey.</p>
        <p>Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern compared the study to a department program that has returned native plants and animals to the city long after they were driven out, like the brook trout, by development or pollution. ''We're promoting biodiversity by helping these creatures get another start,'' he said of the luna moths and woodchucks that have been brought back by the program.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tusa said that if Alley Creek could sustain the finicky brook trout, which once thrived in streams near what is now Minetta Lane and Canal Street in Manhattan, it would be a  sign of New York's recovering ecosystem. ''The symbolic value is enormous,'' he said.</p>
