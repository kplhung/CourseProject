        <p>FLORENT  +++  (212) 989-5779; 69 Gansevoort Street, between Washington and Greenwich Streets, $$; smoking at the bar; cash only.</p>
        <p>The French-American food is good at this bistro, and it won't break the bank. Appetizers include vegetarian chili; sesame chicken brochettes with spicy Thai peanut sauce; and steamed Prince Edward Island mussels. Entrees include vegetarian cous cous; grilled skirt steak with french fries and vegetables; grilled tuna on mesclun with miso ginger vinaigrette, semolina almondine and vegetable; and chicken breast stuffed with wild mushrooms, spinach and Jarlsberg cheese with almond currant semolina and vegetable du jour.

        <p>CAFE FES  +  (212) 924-7653; 246 West Fourth Street, at Charles Street; $$; no smoking; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>Cafe Fes is a Moroccan restaurant, but it feels as much French as North African. Current appetizers include the traditional Moroccan soup made of lamb, onions, lentils, chickpeas, tomatoes, fresh coriander and celery. Main courses include roasted chicken breast cooked in Moroccan spices, fresh coriander, parsley, thyme, onions, garlic chickpeas and carrots; leg of lamb cooked with onions, garlic, ginger, saffron and cumin; and lamb couscous with mixed fresh vegetables. ($25 and Under: 12/6/96)</p>
        <p>SIMPLY CARIBBEAN  +  (212) 254-3856; 240 Sullivan Street, between Bleecker and West Third Streets; $; no smoking; cash only.</p>
        <p>Jamaican meat patties, baked fresh every day, are the specialty at this little Greenwich Village storefront, where the fillings are excellent and the whole wheat crusts are thin and delicate, light yet hearty. Daily specials include oxtail; stew chicken; curry goat and jerk chicken.  Baked delicacies include meatloaf patty; coco bread and cheese; and chicken cocktail. Side orders include roti skin, white rice and dumplings. ($25 and Under: 12/15/99)</p>
        <p>TWO BOOTS TO GO  ++  (212) 633-9096; 75 Greenwich Avenue, at Seventh Avenue and West 11th Street; $$; no smoking; American Express only.</p>
        <p>With three restaurants in Manhattan and one in Park Slope, Two Boots is now an authentic mini-chain, yet there is nothing prefabricated about it. The pizza is pleasant, with thin crusts, the bottoms grainy with cornmeal and such Cajun-oriented toppings as crayfish and jalapeno. Other toppings include roasted peppers, eggplant, spinach, sun dried tomato, andouille, barbecue shrimp and black olives. Other items on the menu include ''the Larry Tate'' pizza, which is a ''bewitching'' blending of spinach, garlic and fresh tomatoes on a white pie; po'boys, the New Orleans-style sandwiches topped with lettuce, tomato, onion and a choice of garlic, mayonnaise or sweet red pepper mayonnaise; and crayfish and andouille roll with ricotta and mozzarella. (Article: 6/16/95; New York Today: April 1998)</p>
        <p>WALLSE  (212) 352-2300; 344 West 11th Street, at Washington Street; $$$; smoking at the bar; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>Kurt Gutenbrunner's appealing little Austrian restaurant is named after his hometown but outfitted with a stylish French accent, with a relaxed neighborhood feeling and a menu devoted to comfortable dishes like rostbraten, Wiener schnitzel, veal goulash and tafelspitz (boiled beef). Appetizers include sauteed foie gras with cherries and apple balsamic vinegar. Entrees include halibut with cucumbers, dill and wild mushrooms; Chatham lobster with chanterelles and fava beans; sturgeon with a melange of peppers, cabbage and green garlic; and roasted organic chicken with sweet corn, peas and artichokes. (Diner's Journal: 8/4/00)</p>
        <p>WATERLOO BRASSERIE  ++  (212) 352-1119; 145 Charles Street, at Washington Street; $$$; smoking at the bar; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>Few restaurants in the West Village can match Waterloo's fashionable charm. The minimalist industrial look comes naturally to the space, which is an old garage. Current appetizers include chilled soup of organic tomato and bell pepper; and seared brook trout with fennel puree, red onion and caper vinaigrette; salad of Maine crabmeat and marinated lentils with French melon; and a selection of chilled East and West coast oysters. Main courses include prime sirloin steak with zucchini, glazed onions and Belgian fries; Atlantic salmon with fennel confit, vanilla rhubarb and port wine; and diver sea scallops and summer corn with roasted mushrooms and fresh tarragon. ($25 and Under: 12/31/97)</p>
