        <p>ECONOMISTS will tell you that one hallmark of a hot economy is an increase in the amount of money homeowners are willing to spend on upgrading, repairing and maintaining their homes.</p>
        <p>What they won't tell you is how to find a good contractor.</p>
        <p>''Right now, we're booked almost a year in advance,'' said Jesse Taylor, president of Just Decks, a contractor in Toms River, N.J.  ''I get a lot of people asking me about putting in fences and swimming pools and things like that, but I tell them that's why we're named Just Decks. I couldn't handle the extra work anyway.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, any homeowner who has scoured the telephone book looking for a contractor  has discovered that it is often now the contractor who gets to pick and choose customers rather than the other way around.</p>
        <p>A number of Internet-based services, however, have been set up to help consumers find qualified and reliable contractors.</p>
        <p>''We provide a free service to homeowners by matching them with prescreened contractors, architects and designers in their geographic area,'' said Sharon Land, a manager with ImproveNet, an online contractor referral service based in Redwood City, Calif.</p>
        <p>Ms. Land said that the company has about 40,000 registered contractors who have passed a stringent prequalification procedure.</p>
        <p>''We screen under four criteria,'' she said, explaining that before contractors will be accepted by ImproveNet they must have been in business under the same name for at least three years, must have a clean legal history (which means that the company cannot have been on the losing end of any lawsuits brought by clients or creditors) and a clean credit history, and must provide proof of insurance.</p>
        <p>''About half the contractors who apply fail the screening process,'' Ms. Land said.</p>
        <p>Nora DePalma, a spokeswoman for ImproveNet, said the company had registered contractors in every state who were experts in just about every home improvement specialty. But unlike most referral services --  which provide homeowners with lists of contractors based on geographical factors or the type of project contemplated -- ImproveNet  provides the contractors with the names of homeowners.</p>
        <p>''The way we work is the homeowner describes the project by filling out an online form,'' Ms. DePalma said, adding that a description of the work to be performed, along with a hoped-for start date and a range of what the customer can afford, is then passed along to contractors in the homeowner's general vicinity.</p>
        <p>''The first four contractors who respond are given the name and telephone number of the customer,'' she said. ''We tell customers that it will take about a week for contractors to respond, but in practice it usually takes just two or three days.''</p>
        <p>The service is free to homeowners, Ms. DePalma said, because the contractors pay ImproveNet a commission for every job they get through the company. ''They pay us between 2 and 10 percent of the job, depending on the type of work they do,'' she said, adding that the maximum amount a contractor is required to pay ImproveNet for any individual job is $995.</p>
        <p>In addition to simply matching up homeowners with contractors, ImproveNet also monitors the process to provide additional assistance and follow-up. ''We assign a personal project adviser to monitor the relationship between the homeowner and the contractor,'' Ms. Land said, explaining that the adviser is available to answer questions the homeowner may have and to assess the results of the matchup when the work is done. The Internet address of ImproveNet is www.ImproveNet.com.</p>
        <p>Another nationwide online contractor referral service is Handyman Online, a company based in Beaverton, Ore. ''We just recently referred out our 100,000th home improvement project,'' said Bruce Stahl, director of marketing for the company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stahl said that Handyman Online (www.handymanonline.com)  was formed in 1997 by two former contractors.</p>
        <p>''We realized that there was a real consumer need for this type of service,'' Mr. Stahl said. ''And the service works well for the contractors, too, because it's a more efficient way for them to find customers.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Stahl explained that the 8,000 or so contractors currently registered with Handyman Online had all been prescreened by the company.</p>
        <p>''Before we send anyone out to a customer we check to make sure that the contractor has insurance and that he is licensed if licensing is required in the state where he's doing business,'' Mr. Stahl said. ''We also require every contractor to provide three references and to sit down with us for a personal interview.''</p>
        <p>Like ImproveNet, Handyman Online is free to customers because contractors pay the company when they land jobs. ''Our contractors pay us a fee of anywhere from $10 to several hundred dollars, depending on the size and type of the job,'' Mr. Stahl said, adding that his company also assigns a customer service representative to each homeowner who requests a contractor.</p>
        <p>''We contact the customer to make sure that a contractor has called,'' he said. ''And then we follow up on the job until the project is completed.''</p>
        <p>Other Internet sites that provide on-line contractor referrals include www.nari.org, the Web site of the National Association of the Remodeling Industry; www.ServiceMagic.com, a company that provides consumers who submit project descriptions with up to three qualified professionals,  and www.NationalContractors.com, a company that specializes in providing preconstruction project planning experts for remodeling projects costing $25,000 or more.</p>
