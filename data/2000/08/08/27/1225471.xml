        <p>WHEN agricultural lands were parceled out centuries ago along the Rhine and Mosel Rivers in what is now southwestern Germany, grapes for making wine were clearly not a priority. The choicest, easy-to-farm flatlands were planted with crops like cabbage and beets. Grapes were relegated to steep hillsides, some inclining as much as 70 degrees, land that would be insane to try to farm. Yet farmers, mostly monks, persevered, and one of the world's great winemaking regions was born.</p>
        <p>The region, which I visited with friends this spring, is one of stunning beauty. Along the Mosel, a sleepy river that flows from Koblenz southwest toward France, vineyards planted with riesling rise at impossible angles from the highway, forming bowl-shaped valleys pointed at the warming sun. The earth is tilled by plow and in the fall the grapes are picked by hand because the ground is too steep for machinery.</p>
        <p>While the Mosel is beautiful, the Rhine is magnificent. The view up to the terraced Rheingau vineyards from this much-bigger river is majestic, interrupted here and there by a ruined castle or a towering monument. From the vineyards, the views down to the river are awe inspiring. Like the Rhine wines, the setting is powerful, but a little aloof. Mosel wines by contrast are more delicate, and the landscape seems more intimate, built on a more human scale and therefore more daunting as you try to imagine working the fields, hugging the earth as you drag yourself up a slope.</p>
        <p>If German wines these days are little known and less appreciated than they are known, German food is even more of a question mark. Few cuisines are as ignored by the rest of the world as Germany's, and the few widespread images are stereotypical: Bavarian beer halls, schnitzel, wurst and fatty hunks of pork with heavy sauces.</p>
        <p>In fact, as with much of the rest of the world, Germany's cuisine has been transformed in the last 25 years, getting lighter and fresher while exalting the best local ingredients. Spring is the season for spargel, the white asparagus that is beloved in Germany, and all over the wine country, restaurants offered special spargel menus. Strawberries and rhubarb were also in the markets, game is always available, and the Germans continue to excel at sweet and sour dishes, combining fruit with vinegar or wine in any number of ways.</p>
        <p>As the world's cuisines move closer together, freely borrowing ingredients and absorbing ideas, national characteristics are in danger of disappearing, and some restaurants in the German wine country offer menus that are almost international in style, serving dishes you might as easily find in Montreal, Miami or Melbourne. But the best restaurants, from casual rathskellers to three-star gastronomic palaces, leave no doubt that no matter how much some of their dishes resemble preparations found elsewhere, their essential character is as German as a glass of cool riesling overlooking a hillside of vines.</p>
        <p>Landhaus St. Urban</p>
        <p>Almost every German winemaker seems to have a sister with a restaurant, but few are as lucky as Nik Weis, the proprietor of St. Urbans-Hof in Leiwen, along the Mosel. His sister and brother-in-law, Ruth and Harald  Russel, own Landhaus St. Urban, a hotel and restaurant in a woodsy grove in Naurath, about 15 miles from Trier, where Mr. Russel has received a Michelin star for his blend of traditional German and contemporary Mediterranean cooking.</p>
        <p>With its timbered walls, big fireplace and waitresses in dirndls, the dining room is anything but contemporary, but at lunch one drizzly day, the weighty atmosphere was lightened by a lush green hillside visible through big picture windows and a tangle of vines and plants within. Mr. Russel's cooking is deft and modern, almost incongruous with the room's more Teutonic touches.</p>
        <p>An appetizer of sliced grilled scallops on a bed of couscous offered a harmony of colors, textures and flavors, balancing almost sour purple chive flowers with the nutty couscous, bracing parsley and sweet currants, a dish of harmonious textures. A second appetizer of mild white-fleshed St. Peter's fish with artichokes, gnocchi and olives was typically Mediterranean, gently scented with anise, like a small bouillabaisse.</p>
        <p>Mr. Russel's skillful sense of counterpoint continued with his main courses. He pairs a firm, well-flavored turbot fillet with savory risotto flavored with parsley and basil, and adorned with tiny stalks of wild green asparagus, which have a mild chivelike flavor. A lightly smoked chicken breast sits atop powerfully rich goose foie gras in a puree of potatoes and leeks, a combination that allows each flavor to sing out.</p>
        <p>Naturally, St. Urban's wine list features local bottles, especially those of St. Urbans-Hof, like a delicious, minerally 1998 Ockfener Bockstein spatlese for about $25, at the rate of 2.2 marks to the dollar.</p>
        <p>Desserts are light, forthright and local, like chopped rhubarb served in a sweet, creamy soup, and ice cream made of sweetened quark, a tangy cheese somewhere between yogurt and cottage cheese that seems to show up on every menu. The curious name, quark, by the way, is German for curds.</p>
        <p>Waldhotel Sonnora</p>
        <p>Should anyone express doubt about the quality of German restaurants, the Germans are quick to bring up the fact that Germany has more Michelin-starred restaurants than any other country outside of France. One of them is this three-star restaurant in Dreis, a hilly town a few miles farther up the Mosel.</p>
        <p>Any Michelin three-star restaurant has to conform to certain standards of comfort and service, so the sumptuous linens and the attentive waiters who appear en masse from out of the woodwork every so often are to be expected. What's surprising about Sonnora is the decor, almost a parody of three-star style with its walls of pale yellow and cream trimmed in gold, thick red carpeting and kitschy niches stuffed with smirking cherubs, and a garish modern painting over a fireplace for contrast.</p>
        <p>With the stage thus set, the delicacy of Helmut Thieltge's cooking comes as a complete surprise, beginning with little gifts from the kitchen like a luscious oxtail consomme with smoked eel, a tiny cup of creamy, oceanic crab bisque and a crisp yet delicate round of blood sausage on apple sauce.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thieltge's dishes are more serene than flashy, calling attention to themselves not by jagged bolts of flavor but by the beauty of the ingredients and the combinations. A parfait of goose foie gras and fig confit, served in a layered wedge, is subtly unctuous, understated yet meltingly rich. In another deceptively simple appetizer, baked red mullet from Brittany is set atop sweet tomatoes, the two parts united by basil-infused oil and an aromatic Alpine cheese.</p>
        <p>Main courses demonstrated versatility, with Mr. Thieltge ranging far with grilled lobster (hummer, as it's called in German), served in a light, foaming curry sauce that seemed to celebrate the sweet meat, with couscous flavored with anise and currants. Roasted saddle of local roebuck is a more classic German dish, the tender slices of meat embraced by a piquant pepper sauce and a crepe filled with cranberries.</p>
        <p>Sonnora's excellent wine list includes reasonably priced older wines, like a remarkable 1981 Wehlener Sonnenuhr spatlese from J. J. Prum for $31, still pale gold and apple fresh, that demonstrates riesling's unusual ability to age.</p>
        <p>We passed on the huge cheese selection, opting instead for sedate desserts, including a sumptuous rhubarb compote with mint, and several variations on quark, including a fine quark brulee, a creamy quark mousse and a sweet quark beignet. As we exited slowly, the assorted cherubs seemed to be laughing at us. Or maybe they were simply happy at our good fortune.</p>
        <p>Weinstube St. Urban</p>
        <p>The long, narrow wine region between the Rhine and the Haardt Mountains is known as the Pfalz, and both its wines and its food are known for their power. The Deidesheimer Hof, a hotel in the center of the pretty town of Deidesheim, south of Bad Durkheim, is home to two restaurants, the Schwarzer Hahn, known for its refined versions of regional dishes, and the St. Urban, a more casual weinstube, or pub with a focus on wines, that offers more traditional cooking. After the formality of Sonnora, a weinstube was welcome relief.</p>
        <p>And yet, St. Urban is no mere corner pub. Rather it is a carefully planned weinstube environment, right down to the grape bunches that are carved into the timbered walls, the stained-glass lampshades, the paneled wood banquettes and the wrought-iron chandeliers. The German love for kitsch was evident in the Bacchus figurines, ceramic cups and bowls and odd statuary that filled all available nooks and crannies.</p>
        <p>St. Urban is the perfect place to try regional specialties like sweet and delicate white asparagus, doused in a rich hollandaise. With a side of boiled potatoes in herbs and a portion of nearly transparent smoked ham, the asparagus can be the centerpiece of a meal.</p>
        <p>Other local dishes sound weighty and substantial, yet the St. Urban kitchen manages to display them at their lightest, like blood sausage ravioli, sheets of pasta so delicate they almost float, topped with savory sausage and smooth liverwurst and bathed in a sharp, tangy mustard sauce. In an interesting variation on this dish, the blood sausage and liverwurst were encased in a narrow wedge of crisp strudel, served with a bracing horseradish-and-apple sauce.</p>
        <p>These were just warm ups, though, for the main course, saumagen, a well-spiced mixture of pork and potatoes that is encased in the stomach lining of a sow like a big sausage, and served in large, slender slices. I passed on the intriguing saumagen carpaccio, opting instead for an excellent traditional version of saumagen, served with creamed sauerkraut, which had an enticingly clear juniper flavor, and garnished with garten kresse, small round leaves that are used often to add a touch of sourness. For appetites that know no bounds, saumagen is also served stuffed with bacon and cheese, with fried cabbage and little potato croquettes, a combination that should, by law, include a long nap afterward.</p>
        <p>The wine list consists mostly of local bottles made in an extremely dry, or trocken, style, that many Germans favor. I would have welcomed a touch of sweetness in our bottle of 1998 Haardter Burgergarten spatlese from Muller-Catoir ($27). Needless to say, a meal like this, delicious as it was, leaves little appetite for dessert.</p>
        <p>Le Val d'Or</p>
        <p>A bit of confusion surrounds this restaurant in a 16th-century castle in the Nahe, a little-known wine region in the Hunsruck Hills between the Rhine and Mosel valleys.</p>
        <p>The castle is now a hotel, called Lafer's Stromburg, in the town of Stromberg, about 20 miles west of Mainz. Lafer is Johann Lafer, a prominent chef who owns the hotel and mercifully calls his two-star restaurant Le Val d'Or.</p>
        <p>The castle seems to have risen organically with the small hillside on which it is perfectly situated, but the restaurant within would fit naturally into any fancy hotel around the world with its thick fleur-de-lis carpeting, luxurious linens, subdued lighting and plush high-backed chairs. Mr. Lafer, a well-known chef on German television, cooks in the international style with copious portions of foie gras and Asian spicing.</p>
        <p>A lush coconut curry soup was typical of his approach. With its mild lemongrass flavor, cubes of lobster meat and delicate rice noodles, it's a Thai-style dish that you might find these days on almost any continent, yet it was exceptional, comfort food of the highest style. Excellent foie gras was graced with rhubarb coulis, a more local touch, served with cabbage that was crunchy yet tender.</p>
        <p>Loup de mer, a firm white-fleshed fish, baked in a salt crust, was brought to the table in impressive fashion, still encased in its plasterlike  shell of salt. A waiter carved it into tender slices that were moist and delicious, if salty, served in a foaming tomato emulsion with leeks, green onions and the ubiquitous white asparagus.</p>
        <p>A second seafood dish, baked roulade of Dover sole, was also remarkably tasty, and salty, accompanied by slender strands of kohlrabi and morels.</p>
        <p>The wide-ranging wine list included surprisingly few Nahe wines, but ours was a good one, a spatlese from Hermann Donnhoff ($40) that tasted like minerals and apples.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lafer comes home with his desserts, including a subtle, pleasant layered pastry spread with rhubarb and cream, and an excellent lemon-scented quark souffle that was light yet rich. You can take the chef out of the country, but I guess you can't take the country out of the chef.</p>
        <p>Bill of fare</p>
        <p>All of these restaurants accept major credit cards, and all permit smoking. Prices are for two with a midpriced bottle of wine.</p>
        <p>Landhaus St. Urban, Budlicherbruck 1, 54426 Naurath-Wald; (49-6509) 91-400. Lunch for two costs about $120. Closed Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Waldhotel Sonnora, Auf dem Eichelfeld, 54518 Dreis; (49-6578) 98-220. Dinner for two, about $250.</p>
        <p>Weinstube St. Urban, Hotel Deidesheimer Hof, Am Marktplatz 1, Deidesheim 67146; (49-6326) 96-870. Lunch for two is about $55.</p>
        <p>Le Val d'Or, Lafer's Stromburg, Schlossberg 1, 55442 Stromberg; (49-6724) 93-100. Dinner for two, about $155. Closed Monday.</p>
        <p>Kruger-Rumpf, Rheinstrasse 47, 55424 Munster-Sarmsheim; (49-6721) 45-050. Dinner for two, about $70. Closed Monday.</p>
        <p>Gutsschanke Schloss Johannisberg, 65366, Geisenheim-Johannisberg; (49-6722) 96-090. Lunch for two, about $90.</p>
        <p>Wine tasting, with a fine meal</p>
        <p>Wineries in the United States have learned that restaurants are a major lure, since visitors often prefer a leisurely sampling of wines with a meal to the somewhat artificial environment of a tasting room devoted to retail sales. In Germany, wineries that are also equipped with restaurants are the exception, but here are two that were both enjoyable but couldn't be more different.</p>
        <p>Kruger-Rumpf is a small and informal family winery in the village of Munster-Sarmsheim in the Nahe, near Bingen, so small, in fact, that the owners, Stefan and Cornelia Rumpf, live right upstairs. What they originally opened as a wine bar has been expanded into a light and airy restaurant with a pleasant, relaxed garden, featuring country cooking with fine seasonal ingredients.</p>
        <p>I enjoyed a simple and traditional meal of sweet white asparagus served with a light, foaming hollandaise, flavorful roast pork with boiled potatoes and herbs, and a dessert of sweet strawberries with a white chocolate parfait. A Kruger-Rumpf 1998 riesling kabinett (about $13.60) was delicate and pleasing.</p>
        <p>At the opposite end of the spectrum is the restaurant at Schloss Johannisberg, one of the most famous and historic wineries in the Rheingau, in an imposing castle high above the banks of the river in Johannisberg. The Rhine vista from the restaurant's glass-windowed terrace is splendid, and busloads of tourists troop in to see it.</p>
        <p>Skyline restaurants often coast on their food because the views are so entrancing, but Johannisberg's is tasty and even creative. A salad of marinated shrimp with white and green asparagus, for example, is flavored not only with parsley, dill and the ubiquitous gartenkresse but also with a little shiso, an unexpected Asian touch that was a delicious surprise.</p>
        <p>A main course of roasted salmon with spinach and boiled potatoes came with two sauces, hollandaise and squid ink, nothing far out, but well prepared. Dessert was simple, fresh strawberries and ice cream.</p>
        <p>A minerally riesling kabinett from Johannisberg ($22), naturally, went well with the meal.</p>
