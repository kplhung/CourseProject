        <p>Oregon's First Congressional District, covering the state's northwest corner and much of Portland, leans Democratic. But Republicans don't automatically cede the seat. The incumbent, Representative David Wu, a moderate freshman Democrat and the lone Chinese-American in the House, beat his Republican opponent in 1998 by only three percentage points.</p>
        <p>So while it's an uphill battle this year for Mr. Wu's Republican challenger, State Senator Charles Starr of Hillsboro, a conservative, it is too soon to call this race. Mr. Wu remains the favorite, with more money and a better organization.</p>
        <p>But he has a problem.</p>
        <p>Some of his most enthusiastic and financially generous supporters from 1998 have soured on him, especially some of the Chinese-Americans and some of the export-conscious business leaders whose backing was crucial to his win. Why?</p>
        <p>He voted against liberalizing trade relations with China, saying its government abused human rights.</p>
        <p>In 1998, thousands of Chinese-Americans all over the country rooted for Mr. Wu to become the third Chinese-American ever to serve in Congress, seeing him as a perfect builder of bridges to China. They gave him their time, their money and, if they were Oregonians, their votes. Likewise, many business leaders in Oregon and around the country rooted for Mr. Wu, figuring he would support liberalized trade.</p>
        <p>He says he told voters in 1998 that he opposed liberalized trade and he notes that many Americans, including a great many Chinese-Americans, agreed with him, then as now, especially those who, like him, had ties to Taiwan. ''This is a matter of democratic values,'' he recently told The Oregonian, the state's leading newspaper.</p>
        <p>His vote nevertheless surprised and soured many supporters. Some now plan to vote Republican. Some refuse to send him money. Some plan to stay home on Nov. 7.</p>
        <p>In another down-to-the-wire race, that combination could be politically fatal.</p>
        <p>''Many people feel he is not doing what they hoped he would,'' Edwin Chan, a Democrat who is president of the Consolidated Chinese Benevolent Association in Portland, said a few days ago. ''Many people are disappointed.''</p>
