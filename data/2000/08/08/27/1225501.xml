        <p>WHEN Jackson Pollock first lifted his brush from the canvas and allowed paint to drip in tangled skeins across the surface, or Jean Arp and Marcel Duchamp began to experiment with chance procedures, they sought in the accidental and unpredictable the means to shatter the stale conventions of art making. So, too, Surrealists like Andre Masson and Joan Miro, who allowed their pens to wander over the page in the belief that they would discover in those doodles the ghosts of their own repressed imaginations. What these artists -- all currently featured at the Museum of Modern Art as part of the show ''Making Choices'' -- hoped to attain was freedom, from the past, from academic formulas, and the random act was their declaration of independence.</p>
        <p>The assumption was that the old masters were a more plodding bunch, perfecting their craft only through years of patient study. But a closer examination of the art of the past reveals that artists -- and writers on art -- have long recognized the importance of the unintended and unexpected in the creative process. Earlier centuries placed a greater emphasis on discipline, but sometimes a masterpiece was born with an inadvertent splash or in a moment of aesthetic pique. The first-century Roman writer Pliny the Elder tells the story of the artist Protegenes, who became frustrated with his efforts to paint a dog foaming at the mouth: ''Finally he fell into a rage with his art . . . and dashed a sponge against the place in the picture that offended him . . . and chance produced the effect of nature in the picture!''</p>
        <p>Here, the rage-induced splatter achieved what no amount of careful planning could, a faithful rendering of animal fury. Similar stories abound in other traditions. A ninth-century Chinese treatise on painting describes the artist Wang Mo, ''who excelled in splattering ink to paint landscapes.'' The chronicler continues with a description that will sound familiar to audiences acquainted with the biographies of more recent artists: ''There was a good deal of wildness in him, and he loved wine. Whenever he wished to paint a hanging scroll, he would first drink, then after he was drunk he would splatter ink. Laughing or singing, he would kick at it with his feet or rub it with his hands. . . . According to the forms and appearances, he would make mountains and rocks, clouds and water.''</p>
        <p>Stories like this -- or another told of the 12th-century painter Cheng Kang-chung, who also preferred to make his ink-blot paintings after a few stiff drinks -- show that the myth of artist as savage is not an invention of the Romantic era. For the Chinese chronicler, as for more modern biographers, vitality of expression is often the gift of the untamed soul. But it need not be the product of uncontrolled passion. One artist who tried to systematize the use of the fortuitous mark was the English landscape painter Alexander Cozens, whose 1785 how-to manual, ''A New Method of Assisting the Invention in Drawing Original Compositions of Landscape,'' recommends covering the page with random ink blots, ''to draw forth ideas of an ingenious mind disposed to the art of designing.'' The ink blots suggest new forms to the mind in a manner similar to the Rorschach test, whose deliberate ambiguity serves to draw out the patient's own fantasies or obsessions.</p>
        <p>While Cozens's goal was not to probe the psychology of the artist, he knew that indeterminate forms could unlock the inner workings of the mind. ''There is a singular advantage peculiar to this method,'' he declared, ''which is, that from the rudeness and uncertainty of the shapes made in blotting, one artificial blot will suggest different ideas to different persons; on which account it has the strongest tendency to enlarge the powers of invention.'' Cozens, like the Surrealists a century and a half later, understood that ambiguity gave rise to individuality. In its dismissal of convention and promotion of idiosyncratic invention, this treatise is an important early salvo in the nascent Romantic revolt.</p>
        <p>E. H. Gombrich, who wrote extensively on the role of the accident in his book ''Art and Illusion,'' stressed that ambiguity is the main ingredient in all such techniques. But mere ambiguity is not enough to explain the efficaciousness of these forms, which suggest profound affinities among the psychological, the natural and the creative. Leonardo da Vinci, whom Cozens cites as the inspiration for his own pedagogical technique, uses similarly muddled forms for the purpose of ''arousing the mind to various inventions.''</p>
        <p>Significantly, Leonardo's preferred method was not to hurl and splatter at random but to find suggestive forms in nature itself. In a famous passage from his ''Treatise on Painting,'' Leonardo encourages the aspiring landscape painter seek inspiration in natural forms ''Look at any walls spotted with various stains or with a mixture of different kinds of stones,'' he wrote. ''If you are about to invent some scenes, you will be able to see in it a resemblance to various different landscapes adorned with mountains, rivers, rocks, trees, plains, with valleys and various groups of hills.'' Leonardo's method differs from Cozens's in that he seeks out the accidental in the world around him rather than improvising it on the page. But, as Mr. Gombrich asserts: ''It matters less whether the initial form into which the artist projects the image is man-made or found. What matters is what he can make of it.''</p>
        <p>The ''found accident'' shifts the focus from the world of the mind to the world of nature. Mr. Gombrich finds a remarkable parallel to Leonardo's method in a passage by an 11th-century Chinese artist, Sung Ti, who recommended that to achieve a ''natural effect'' in landscape, the painter should throw a piece of silk over an old wall and study its bumps and hollows. It is not surprising that the found landscape plays a central role in Chinese art, which, heavily influenced by Taoist beliefs, proclaims the unity of all nature. The purest embodiment of these beliefs is the so-called scholar's rocks, naturally occurring stones -- sometimes minimally ''improved'' through human intervention -- cherished for their capacity to conjure in their crags and hollows whole landscapes or mythical beasts. Robert D. Mowry, writing in ''Worlds Within Worlds: The Richard Rosenblum Collection of Chinese Scholars' Rocks,'' explains: ''Like a landscape painting, the rock represented a microcosm of the universe.''</p>
        <p>THE notion of a single stone standing as a cosmos-in-miniature is intimately bound up with the Taoist world view, but this feeling for the indivisibility of nature is not confined to the Eastern tradition. An intriguing echo can be found in a treatise on painting an the early 15th-century follower of Giotto, Cennino Cennini. In a chapter titled ''The Way to Copy a Mountain from Nature,'' Cennini advises. ''If you wish to acquire good style for mountains, and to have them look natural, get some large stones, rugged, and not cleaned up; and copy them from nature, applying the lights and the darks as your system requires.'' Though this passage is often quoted as an example of the artificiality of medieval studio practice, it reveals an understanding of how a single set of principles runs through all nature, from the microscopic to the monumental, a belief that Leonardo would certainly have found congenial. Like the Chinese scholar, the medieval Italian painter was able, to borrow William Blake's famous line, ''to see infinity in a grain of sand.''</p>
        <p>Ultimately, the mottled forms of the ink spatter or the convoluted topography of a water-carved stone are suggestive enough to stimulate the imagination and open-ended enough to allow for an almost infinite variety of readings. Because they are not made deliberately they do not come with assigned meanings. Rather, it is we -- artist and viewer -- who must make sense of them, bringing our own experience and personalities to bear. The role of the accidental form as both a diagnostic tool in psychology and a creative tool in art testifies to the mind's need to organize random data into meaningful configurations. Whether deliberately fashioned, sought out or merely stumbled upon, such forms traffic simultaneously in the universal and the deeply personal. They are both liberating in their capacity to stimulate our creative faculties and tyrannical in their insistence that wherever we look, we will only see ourselves reflected.</p>
