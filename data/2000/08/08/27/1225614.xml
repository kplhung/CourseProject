        <p>The video is called ''Operation Meet Your Neighbor.'' The neighbors in this case are three young mothers and an older woman trying with varying degrees of success to get off welfare and start working.</p>
        <p>''Operation Meet Your Neighbor'' was developed by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark and the Paterson, Trenton, Metuchen and Camden dioceses. It follows the day-to-day frustrations of real people as they try to comply with the state's new welfare program, Work First New Jersey, which went into effect in 1997.</p>
        <p>''It's an effort to put a face on poverty in the state of New Jersey,'' said Joseph F. Duffy, executive director of Catholic Charities for the Paterson diocese, ''to explode myths about welfare recipients and show who the poor are and how they are faring under welfare reform.''</p>
        <p>Apparently not that well, according to the video. A single mother in the film works two jobs but still has trouble supporting herself and a son with cerebral palsy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Duffy, who appears as a commentator in it, said in an interview that changes to the welfare system may look successful , with costs cut in half and more people working, but many families are earning salaries below poverty level, while others who have been unable to work have fallen through the cracks. The poverty rate, especially among children, remains high, he added.</p>
        <p>The Paterson diocese was the first to send the video to all its parishes -- 111 in all in Passaic, Morris and Sussex Counties. Soon the video will be distributed to every Catholic parish, including parochial schools, in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Mr. Duffy said the video was meant to inspire people to action. That could take the form of helping their ''neighbors''; for example, being a mentor or driving a client to a job interview. But it also involves learning about the issues and legislation affecting welfare and poverty, and trying to influence policy by ''educating'' legislators, among others, he added.</p>
        <p>Even before Congress passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996, faith-based organizations, such as Catholic Charities, and private nonprofit groups were encouraged by government officials to provide services for the poor that were once performed by government.</p>
        <p>And in the current presidential campaign, George W. Bush and Al Gore have encouraged churches to take advantage of a provision in the 1996 act that allows faith-based groups to contract with the government to provide social services.</p>
        <p>Eleanor Brilliant, professor of social policy in the School of Social Work at Rutgers University, New Brunswick, said that as a result of the Welfare Reform Act, this new contracting relationship has raised concerns among civil libertarians about the separation of church and state.</p>
        <p>''I think that that's a fairly new kind of advocacy by the church,'' Dr. Brilliant said when told of the video. ''Catholic Charities has done some very good work and this may be, 'We're going to help people become advocates.' ''</p>
        <p>But danger arises, she added, whenever a religious group focuses on specific legislation.</p>
        <p>''The scary side of this is that if the church is pushing for certain bills, that's O.K., if I'm on their side of the issue,'' she said. ''What happens when I'm not?''</p>
        <p>The Rev. Robert J. Vitillo, executive director of the Catholic Campaign for Human Development in Washington, D.C., which awarded a grant for the creation of the video, doesn't see the danger in such advocacy, noting that educating people about the issues that affect poverty has always been in the church's tradition of helping the poor.</p>
        <p>''I think the danger many faith-based organizations bring up is that faith-based organizations can do their share but it takes a response from all sectors of the society to deal with issues surrounding poverty,'' Father Vitillo said. ''The concern raised by faith-based organizations is that they alone can't substitute for government in this response.''</p>
        <p>Father Vitillo said New Jersey's video was the only one of its type dealing with welfare to be funded by the Catholic Campaign for Human Development.</p>
        <p>Several years ago, the agency, an arm of the United States Catholic Conference of Bishops assigned to address poverty, invited Catholic groups around the country to submit projects that explored welfare changes in their states.</p>
        <p>New Jersey was one of 12 states funded in the first round. With a grant of $35,000, it was among 4 that chose to use the funds for a campaign to educate the public. But only New Jersey made an extended video -- about 40 minutes. (Florida made a televised public service announcement, and Ohio and Indiana printed leaflets.)</p>
        <p>A steering committee from Catholic Charities agencies in New Jersey and Social Issues Councils of the New Jersey Catholic Conference met monthly, beginning in September 1998, and devised the idea.</p>
        <p>The committee chose 10 families around the state and finally focused on four people: a Hispanic mother and an African-American mother from Paterson, a Caucasian mother from Newark, and a 59-year old African-American woman, from Lakewood, who was not only unskilled but also ill.</p>
        <p>''In its way,'' Father Vitillo said, ''it's a very practical application of the principle of Catholic social teaching, which is to build strong relationships with those living in poverty.''</p>
        <p>Each pastor will decide how the video will be used. The social concerns committee at St. Ann's Church, for instance, a suburban parish in Parsippany, plans to use it in group discussions aimed at improving the workfare system, said Thomas McCann, director of Parish Social Ministry for the Paterson Diocese.</p>
        <p>St. Agnes Church, a predominantly Hispanic parish in South Paterson, will use it in a program to teach families of their rights under the new system and of the need to vote, said the pastor, the Rev. Luciano Cruz.</p>
        <p>Noting that there are many single-parent families in his parish struggling to pay the average rent of $800 a month and get at least one meal a day, Father Cruz added, ''This parish is among the poorest of the poor. We deal with these cases that 'Meet Your Neighbor' discussed.''</p>
