Union members received a wide range of concessions from the company, which was formed by Bell Atlantic's acquisition of the GTE Corporation, including higher wages and benefits, stock options, increased job stability and greater freedom to organize in Verizon's fast-growing wireless division. The strike created a backlog of roughly and 200,000 new service orders.</p>
