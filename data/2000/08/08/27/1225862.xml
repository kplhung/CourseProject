        <p>With her younger sister Serena, whom she hopes to dethrone as the United States Open champion, looking on, Venus Williams put on a virtuoso performance in overpowering Monica Seles, 6-2, 6-4, today to win the Pilot Pen tennis tournament for the second straight year.</p>
        <p>Williams has not been beaten since before she won at Wimbledon in July. She has won 4 tournament titles and 19 matches in a row.</p>
        <p>Demonstrating that she will be a top contender at the United States Open, which begins Monday and at which she will be seeded third, Williams beat Seles in a final for the second time in three weeks.</p>
        <p>She played brilliantly. No matter what the 26-year-old Seles did -- and she played well -- Williams, 20, had a riposte, usually a sizzling ground-stroke winner or a spectacular retrieval. Typifying Seles's frustration was an apparent winner she hit in the final game of the match. With Williams on the left side of the court, Seles hammered an overhead into the right corner. The 6-foot-1-inch Williams sprinted to her right, stretched fully and whipped a forehand winner down the line, electrifying the crowd of 8,363 at the Connecticut Tennis Center.</p>
        <p>Even Williams said she was surprised by the shot. ''That doesn't happen very often,'' said Williams, who has won four of the seven tournaments she has played since returning to competition in May, after taking five months off because of tendinitis in her hands. ''I was just going for broke.''</p>
        <p>That was one of 28 outright winners by Williams, 20 of which came in the second set. The second-seeded Seles, by contrast, had 13 winners and 23 unforced errors; the top-seeded Williams had 17 unforced errors. Williams, ranked third in the world, also had a big edge on service, getting in 56 percent of her first serves and hammering in 9 aces compared to Seles's 2.</p>
        <p>Time and again, Williams ran down apparent winners. And her strategy of focusing on Seles's backhand proved effective.</p>
        <p>Williams struggled somewhat in winning her first two matches here against Yelena Likhovtseva and Patty Schnyder, and conceded earlier in the week that she had a tendency to lose focus against lesser players. But she raised the level of her play against the top-echelon players. That, she said, was the case today.</p>
        <p>''The difference today was that I was playing Monica, who is a caliber above a normal player, and I know I wanted to win this match not only going into the Open but because she has never defeated me before,'' said Williams, who is 4-0 against Seles. Williams has dropped only one set to Seles, at their last meeting, in San Diego on Aug. 4.</p>
        <p>After capturing the opening set easily by breaking Seles three times, Williams broke Seles twice, then held serve at 15 to lead by 5-3 in the second set. On her next service, she closed out the match at love with consecutive aces that registered about 110 miles an hour.</p>
        <p>Despite Williams's superb performance, Seles said she thought her rival was playing similar to a year ago. ''I would say she is playing about the same,'' said Seles, who has won three tournaments this year and is ranked sixth in the world. ''Everyone says she is playing better, and obviously her serve is very strong, and physically she gets back a lot of balls. So that is a tough combination and puts a lot of pressure on your own serve.''</p>
        <p>Addressing the crowd after her victory, Williams apologized for her slow start. ''I was not putting on a good show,'' she said with a smile, ''but with the help of my dad, I cleaned up my act.''</p>
        <p>Williams earned $87,000, bringing her earnings this year to $1,196,900. Seles won $43,500.</p>
