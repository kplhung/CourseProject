        <p>In downtown New Rochelle, in Westchester County, a decaying mall was replaced by an elaborate $194 million entertainment complex that is meant to evoke an idealized image of city life.</p>
        <p>In downtown Hempstead village, on Long Island, a shopping center with a Home Depot is nearing completion on the former site of an Abraham &amp; Straus department store.</p>
        <p>And in downtown Englewood, N.J., officials have been working block by block to revive a section of a shopping strip that only recently was scarred by drug dealing and abandoned buildings.</p>
        <p>All over the region -- and throughout the country -- suburban communities are struggling to reverse a decline that began decades ago as shoppers fled the central business districts for the outlying malls, leaving behind deserted commercial streets that cast a pall on the surrounding residential neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>These days, the robust economy, a growing distaste for suburban sprawl and increasing demands on people's time are helping to fuel a renewed focus on suburban downtowns. Suburban malls are not exactly a thing of the past, but many people find them a nuisance to get in and out of, especially for smaller errands.</p>
        <p>''Neighborhood shopping has taken a huge jump,'' said Philip H. Kowalcyzk, a managing partner at Kurt Salmon Associates, a retail consulting firm in New York. ''It's all about the convenience factor.''</p>
        <p>At the same time, wealthier suburbs are becoming less receptive to so-called big-box stores, like Home Depot and Costco, forcing retailers to look for alternatives.</p>
        <p>Often, they are finding them on the edge of cities, in the older suburbs, which long ago ceased being a refuge from urban problems and now tend to look much more like the cities themselves, racially and socioeconomically.</p>
        <p>''The relentless sprawl of the 90's, and the resulting congestion, has made the outer areas more hostile to development,'' said James W. Hughes, the dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. ''The developers are getting a warmer welcome in urban communities.''</p>
        <p>National retailers are also beginning to recognize the buying power of minority neighborhoods, and are less afraid to venture into them.</p>
        <p>Seizing on these trends, several older suburban communities in the New York region have devised plans for increasing their tax base and resuscitating their downtowns. Some, like New Rochelle and Mount Vernon, also in Westchester County, hope that entertainment will be a magnet. Others, like Englewood, have adopted a more gradual, comprehensive approach. And still others, like Hempstead and Port Chester, in Westchester County, are counting on big-box development.</p>
        <p>Some urban planners have voiced skepticism about the larger projects, saying that they are not likely to be the magic bullet that turns around a downtown, especially if the people who use them can avoid the downtown streets. ''Generally, the big single project dropping out of the sky won't do it,'' said Bob Yaro, the executive director of the Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit civic group serving New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</p>
        <p>Englewood offers a cautionary tale. In the early 1990's, the city approved plans for a shopping mall behind West Palisade Avenue, a stretch of its downtown that is literally on the other side of the tracks from the more prosperous east side. The mall created jobs, but it did not lead to more pedestrian traffic on West Palisade, apparently because it was self-contained, with parking right in front of the stores. ''It was a peninsula,'' said Peter Beronio, the city's director of economic development.</p>
        <p>Since then, Englewood has rethought its strategy for revitalizing West Palisade and is now considered a model for other small cities, said Jef R. Buehler, the acting state coordinator of Main Street New Jersey, an economic development program run by the State Department of Community Affairs.</p>
        <p>It is too early to know whether New Roc City, New Rochelle's new entertainment complex, will escape the fate of other large projects that could not deliver on their promises.</p>
        <p>Built in part with public money -- including $25 million from the city for the construction of a garage -- New Roc City straddles an immaculate cobblestone street and has a facade inspired by New York of the 1920's. The new complex, which replaced a shopping mall abandoned by Macy's in 1992, includes an 18-screen theater, two skating rinks, a video game room, an amusement ride called the Space Shot, two restaurants and a Super Stop and Shop market.</p>
        <p>Although business has been light on weekdays, New Roc City draws crowds on weekends. Regal Cinemas, the nation's largest movie house chain, says its theater at New Roc City is one of the company's top 10 performers. Robert M. Greene, one of the developers, said about 70,000 people visited the center each week, exceeding his projections.</p>
        <p>Angela North, a Pelham, N.Y., resident who works on Wall Street, goes to New Roc several times a week with her children. ''I think it's great,'' she said. ''And you can't complain about the security. The kids aren't going to cause any problems.'' The complex has a police substation and a highly visible security office.</p>
        <p>But a number of storefronts near the complex are empty, and several downtown business owners said New Roc had yet to bring them more customers. ''The effect that everybody is looking for is not there yet,'' said Addison Cornelius, the owner of Dominic's, a men's clothing store that has been in New Rochelle since 1966. ''Everybody thought it would happen overnight. That's not realistic.''</p>
        <p>Not long ago, New Rochelle officials were reminded that urban redevelopment is more often than not a Sisyphean endeavor. R.E.I., which sells outdoor gear and clothing and is one of Main Street's few upscale retailers, said it would close its 11-year-old store next June because of disappointing sales.</p>
        <p>And New Roc itself has had setbacks. The project includes 92 units of office space, but they have not been rented, and the developers have asked to be allowed to convert them into apartments. City officials would have preferred downtown to have both residents and hundreds of new office workers, who would make use of shops and restaurants during the day, said Michael D. Ritchie, the city's commissioner of development.</p>
        <p>Family Golf Centers, the parent company of Sports Plus, the operator of the center's skating rinks and video arcades, filed for bankruptcy protection in May. But Mr. Greene, the developer, said Family Golf's problems were not hurting New Roc City.</p>
        <p>Even before it opened, however, New Roc had spurred other development in downtown New Rochelle. Avalon Bay Communities, a real estate investment trust, is building 1,000 market-rate rental apartments near the train station -- the first housing of this type in downtown New Rochelle since World War II. Fred Harris, a vice president of Avalon Bay, said the project would not have gone forward without New Roc City.</p>
        <p>City officials say the new apartments will have a bigger impact on downtown than New Roc City because they will attract young professionals who have been priced out of the New York City housing market.</p>
        <p>Whether New Roc proves successful, planners like the fact that it is surrounded by city sidewalks, not cut off from downtown by a large parking lot. ''New Roc City is a great start,'' said Elliott D. Sclar, the director of the urban planning program at Columbia University. ''It's the antithesis of putting a Home Depot in the middle of town.''</p>
        <p>Other suburban cities are also looking at entertainment as a draw. In densely packed Mount Vernon, Mayor Ernest D. Davis, an architect by training, dreams of creating space for a sports arena and hotel by building a platform over the railroad tracks that run through the center of town. He said the plan was being studied.</p>
        <p>Mayor Davis is opposed to putting superstores in the center of downtown. But other communities are hoping that the big boxes will jump-start downtown redevelopment.</p>
        <p>A superstore does not necessarily spell the death of mom-and-pop businesses, said N. David Milder, the president of Danth Inc., a consulting company in Queens that helped Englewood formulate its downtown revitalization strategy. But whether the smaller stores can benefit from increased traffic may hinge on whether the rest of downtown is visible and easily accessible to the superstore's customers, he said.</p>
        <p>Suburban officials also say they are trying to persuade independent merchants to compete more effectively by staying open later to accommodate commuters or by improving their displays.</p>
        <p>In Hempstead, where two-thirds of the population is black or Hispanic, it was considered a coup when the village was able to attract Home Depot to the middle of town, said Lee E. Koppelman, executive director of the Long Island Regional Planning Board. But the Home Depot, the anchor for a shopping center that will also contain an Old Navy clothing store and a supermarket, is behind a parking lot with spaces for 1,300 cars. Customers never have to set foot downtown.</p>
        <p>Mayor James A. Garner, however, said the stores near the new shopping center were benefiting from the increased traffic. ''It's brought a lot of business in,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In Port Chester, plans for a development along the Byram River drew vehement protests and charges of racism because about 170 homes and businesses, many of them belonging to Hispanics, were relocated to make way for the project, which will include a Costco warehouse store and a Super Stop and Shop .</p>
        <p>Officials say the shopping center will be an integral part of the business district, with the stores designed to resemble boutiques. ''It will be a mall turned inside out,'' Mayor Christine Korff said. ''The store entrances will face the sidewalks.'' The project was also supposed to include a Loews Cineplex, but the company recently shelved plans to come to Port Chester.</p>
        <p>Port Chester's major asset is its numerous ethnic restaurants, which  attract patrons from other parts of Westchester County and southern Connecticut. Joyce M. Lannert, the commissioner of planning for Westchester County, said she expected restaurants to benefit from the project. ''Once people go shopping and have a parking space, they might as well try one of the fun restaurants,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But some critics of the plan question whether people shopping at Costco for perishable goods will spend any of their time on downtown streets. Jennifer Kohn, an owner of Kneaded Bread, a two-year-old bakery on Main Street, said she welcomed the increased traffic but wondered whether the new stores would fit in with the restaurants. ''Maybe if they put in an artsy theater, it would really go with the mood of the town,'' she said. ''If you want to elevate the town, I don't think this is the way to do it.''</p>
        <p>Most experts in the so-called new urbanism say reviving a downtown is a painstaking process. ''The successful examples,'' said Mr. Yaro of the Regional Plan Association, ''are the ones that developed in a more organic way, that were built around the historic fabric of the town. These things don't happen right away. It takes a vision that is broadly shared and implemented over a decade or more.''</p>
