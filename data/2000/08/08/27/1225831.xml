        <p>In an upscale enclave, where prices hover well above the half-million-dollar range, the home could stand as a stucco symbol of Williams's journey from the beaded curiosity out of Compton, Calif., to an independent young woman with a Grand Slam title of her own, from the gangly 10-year-old who used to cup giggles with her hand to the sleek 20-year-old who strides into rooms with the same detached stare as a model on a catwalk.</p>

        <p>Just down the road from her parents' roomy but unassuming Colonial, with its green shutters and patchy lawn, the sawdust has settled on the construction of Venus Williams's gated home in South Florida.</p>
        <p>In an upscale enclave, where prices hover well above the half-million-dollar range, the home could stand as a stucco symbol of Williams's journey from the beaded curiosity out of Compton, Calif., to an independent young woman with a Grand Slam title of her own, from the gangly 10-year-old who used to cup giggles with her hand to the sleek 20-year-old who strides into rooms with the same detached stare as a model on a catwalk.</p>
        <p>''I'm not really mature at all,'' Williams said as she stood just a few yards from her father, Richard Williams, last week. ''Really, I'm not.''</p>
        <p>While articulate and thoughtful on grown-up subjects, she delights in pulling benevolent pranks, was among the first to snap up the latest Harry Potter tale and often misses the coziness of her old bed.</p>
        <p>''I still miss my old room when it comes down to it,'' said Williams, who shares her new home in Palm Beach Gardens with her 18-year-old sister, Serena. ''I miss my bed. My new bed is too big, I think. It's a king, and it fits the size of the room, but I miss my old bed. Something about it.''</p>
        <p>It was familiar, comfortable, just the right size for a teenager. And just as with anyone dipping her toe into adulthood, a part of Williams wants to hold on to the past. Unlike others in her position, however, her growth spurts and sputters in maturity have been caught on film.</p>
        <p>One year ago, Venus Williams was uncovered as a late bloomer. From beneath her hood, she watched stoically as Serena Williams won the first Grand Slam championship of the Williams family at the United States Open. Now, after a mesmerizing Wimbledon title in July, and a 19-match winning streak, Venus Williams will arrive in Queens this week as a player who has come into her own.</p>
        <p>Although Williams recoils at the notion that a sibling rivalry prompted her refocused rise -- and uses her patented glare to turn mortals to dust if they mention it -- Serena Williams's title did provide her big sister with a template for how a Grand Slam tournament is won.</p>
        <p>''I think that was a turning point for Venus,'' said Tracy Austin, an analyst for the USA Network and an Open champion herself. ''I will never forget the look on Venus's face when Serena won. She had the hood over her head, hands under her chin, and didn't look excited. I think she expected to be the first. And that fall, Serena beat her for the first time in a match. Then you didn't see Venus for six months.''</p>
        <p>It was a time to heal. Wrist tendinitis was the official injury, but there is a suspicion that Venus Williams needed a chance to mend her passion for the game. To fill her time, she took a fashion design class and stayed low while her father talked of her imminent retirement, and she discovered how much she missed the game. Playing beat studying, beat an office job, beat everything. Once Williams returned, there was dedication in everything she did.</p>
        <p>''I think most of all, I've just changed my whole attitude,'' Williams, who is seeded No. 3, said. ''I try to go for my shots. I don't just let something happen. I'm focused on that. Right now, I don't think there are too many players who say, 'Hey, I want to play Venus Williams,' even if I'm playing badly. No matter which Venus comes, it's not going to be that easy. What I'm trying to do is be consistent. I'm not No. 1, but I hear once you get to the top, it's hard to stay there. What I'm doing now is just preparation for that.''</p>
        <p>But there is no primer for handling fame. When discovered a decade ago, Williams was viewed as a novelty act hatched from her eccentric father's imagination. As she grew into her 6-foot-1-inch frame before everyone's eyes, no one knew if she would fill out her potential, too. She was well known, but by winning Wimbledon, her image saturated the public eye.</p>
        <p>''All the players I've known who have come up and then won a Grand Slam, it just puts closure on their goal, so to speak,'' said Lynne Rolley, the director of programs for the United States Tennis Association. ''And then the popularity, admiration and appreciation comes from that Grand Slam, but they don't know that's going to come with it because their focus has been just on playing well, improving and winning a title.''</p>
        <p>As with everything else, Williams is growing into her amplified celebrity. Few have the ability to disarm a crowd with her charm or leave them laughing with her colorful anecdotes, but sometimes the demands on her time leave her in a petulant mood. While she realizes her impact on society -- and recently told the story of an African-American child she met at a Best Buy who was playing a tennis video game while wearing a golf glove like Tiger Woods -- Venus Williams does not campaign to be a role model.</p>
        <p>Just after Wimbledon, her mother and father said, ''Venus, you're a star now.'' Sometimes, she revels in it, other times she wants to go unnoticed. As a result, she buys hats now and wears sunglasses, too. But while competing at the Pilot Pen tournament last week in New Haven, she couldn't camouflage her fame.</p>
        <p>''This week hasn't been easy for me because when I'm walking down the street, I'm not having any peace,'' Williams said with a sigh. ''When I'm in the elevator of the hotel, even the operator doesn't leave me alone.</p>
        <p>''I just think people don't understand that I have to deal with a lot of people every day. If I say, 'No, I don't want to do autographs' or 'No, I don't want to take pictures,' it doesn't mean I'm a bad person. Everyone needs their own space.''</p>
        <p>She has that in her new home. Although she lives in an upscale community, the house is not garish. A real estate agent in the area described the home as classy. Part of growing up means gaining perspective on money and lifestyle. Over the past couple of years, Williams has started driving more cautiously -- ''because seeing the lights in your mirror is worse than losing'' -- and remaining grounded in her spending. She and her sister bought their Wimbledon champions' dinner dresses at a mall, and they are more likely to seek out the Olive Garden over a chic bistro when they come to town this week.</p>
        <p>''I don't actually have a budget, but I don't spend recklessly at all,'' Venus Williams said. ''I'm conservative, yeah. The most expensive car I ever bought was a truck. I don't want to spend money on things that will devaluate. I won't buy cars. I just have to find a way to get one free. If I can't, I'll just have to drive what I have. But I'm happy with my truck.''</p>
        <p>It's simple, comfortable and good transportation between her home and her parents'. If only she could load up her old bed. She misses the old box springs and some other homespun comforts, but some things she is glad to leave behind.</p>
        <p>''There was no home cooking,'' Williams said. ''It was like, find your own meal and hide it in the refrigerator, and hope no one eats it. If I went and bought some baked chicken, I'd have to put in the back, like put it in the vegetable section so no one would know it was there. I don't have to do that anymore.''</p>
        <p>She is on her own.</p>
