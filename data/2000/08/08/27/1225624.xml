        <p>Maryann Scarbowski's horses seem more bothered by one pony's attempt to monopolize a bale of hay than by the drone of a small aircraft overhead. Like their owner and her three boys, the horses have grown accustomed to the sputter and buzz of the planes that fly by every minute or two.</p>
        <p>However, a proposal to lengthen and widen the runway at the South Jersey Regional Airport, which backs up to Ms. Scarbowski's woods, has her and many of her neighbors apprehensive about the noise, safety hazards, environmental impact and decreased property values such an expansion could mean for this once rural community.</p>
        <p>The larger runway, which would be designated by the Federal Aviation Administration as a facility to relieve congestion at Philadelphia International Airport, would allow for a heavier volume and use by larger noncommercial jets. The airport, on Stacy Haines Road here, is home to 200 airplanes and handles about 61,000 annual takeoffs and landings, limited to planes up to eight passengers. With plans to lengthen the runway from 3,911 to 5,500 feet and widen it from 50 to 100 feet, the airport's estimated traffic could increase from 5 to 50 percent over the next 10 years, depending on who is talking, and could accommodate 14-passenger planes.</p>
        <p>Soon after learning about the plans last year, Ms. Scarbowski and others organized the Citizens Against Runway Expansion, which now numbers 450. The group has met with local and state politicians and has held leaflet drives, researched aeronautic and environmental regulations and gotten the New Jersey Department of Transportation to extend the public comment period on the proposal by 90 days. That period ends Thursday, but group members are bolstered by the attention they have received since the recent midair collision that killed 11 people in two small lanes over Burlington Township, less than 10 miles from here.</p>
        <p>''We've gotten a lot more response since the crash two weeks ago,'' said Ken Peacock, president of the citizens' group. ''It's like 'Uh-oh, an air crash. Now we better get on the stick like we're doing something.' ''</p>
        <p>A final environmental assessment report, responding to all the public comments, will be released this fall, according to a spokesman for the State Deparment of Transportation, John Dourgarian. A preliminary draft was issued in April, followed by a hearing that brought out several hundred people and heated, often angry, debate. Another hearing Aug. 15 was more composed, with representatives of Transportation Department meeting with citizens one on one.</p>
        <p>The final report will include recommendations, either to go ahead with the planned expansion or modify it (outright denial is unlikely). If the runway is given the green light, the airport's owners, Aviation Industrial Realty Corporation, can then move forward with its $20 million expansion, 90 percent of which will be federally financed.</p>
        <p>While neither airplane in the Burlington collision was flying to or from South Jersey Regional Airport, the parties involved in the expansion debate are pointing to safety as their main concern for why the runway should -- or should not -- be extended.</p>
        <p>Planes taking off from the runway now fly directly over the half-million-dollar homes soon to be completed in the Sterling Chase development in Lumberton just north of the airport. To the west, hundreds of other homes have sprung up in neighboring Mount Laurel, and ground is being cleared for an  elementary school, which will be built less than a mile from the runway.</p>
        <p>Gwen Swire, whose two children would probably go to the 600-pupil school once it is completed next year, is concerned about the safety and noise of planes flying overhead.</p>
        <p>''The new school is straight off the path of the runway,'' Ms. Shire said. ''Should there be an accident, it's more likely to happen with takeoffs and landings. There's been so much build-up in the area, it's just not the right place any longer.''</p>
        <p>Bob Mathews, vice president of Aviation Industrial Realty, said the Mount Laurel school board was warned that the proposed site for the school was not the best choice.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mathews also challenged those who decided to build new homes in the path of an airport runway. ''How could you build a house in the downwind of an airport if you don't like airplane noise,'' he said. ''It's like buying a house across from a pig farm and expecting roses.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mathews said the expanded runway was necessary to accommodate the larger jets corporate executives fly these days. He estimates a 5 percent increase in the number of daily flights, but a significant jump in fuel sales to the larger jets. As far as safety goes, he points out that as the only ''reliever status'' airport in South Jersey, his airport is providing an important safety role for the region as a whole.</p>
        <p>''The purpose of this airport in the national aviation plan is to relieve congestion at larger airports like Philadelphia and Baltimore by providing a safe and comfortable location for executive traffic,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Scarbowski, who teaches horseback riding to children, said her concern was not so much the increase in size or number of aircraft using the airport, but the disregard some pilots have for the regulations.</p>
        <p>''It's not the crowding, it's the cowboying,'' she said. ''There's no police up there, and half these guys are hot dogs and have absolutely no respect for the Federal Aviation Administration rules. She recalled a time a pilot beaded in on her farmhouse's roof line while performing a downward spiral, a move that caused her to interrupt a riding lesson and run into the house to get her children out.</p>
        <p>During flight, planes are required to fly at least 1,000 feet above the highest structure in the area. However, during take-offs and landings there are no minimum height requirements, according to an F.A.A. spokesman, Jim Peters. And while there is a designated aerobatics practice space in the area, Mr. Peters said, such maneuvers over residences are frowned on.</p>
        <p>''If they're seeing aerobatics over their houses, it could be a violation of federal aviation regulations and we'd look into it,'' Mr. Peters said. ''A hot-dogging pilot is something we do not tolerate.'' He noted that the F.A.A. had received no recent complaints of this nature from residents near South Jersey Regional Airport.</p>
        <p>While the State Department of Transportation prepares its final report, Mr. Dourgarian warned against drawing conclusions from the recent midair collision, which, he said, ''could have happened anywhere.''</p>
        <p>''There's nothing wrong with looking into air space issues in light of the accident,'' Mr. Dourgarian said. ''We're not diminishing the neighbors' concerns. They have the right to ask questions and we're committed to getting them answered. But it's important to bear in mind that runway extensions are not just about larger planes. It's about improving runway safety.''</p>
