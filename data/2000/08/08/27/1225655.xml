        <p>Ines Kovatch letter says she was prompted by Neil Genzlinger's August 6 article to make donation to Popcorn Park Zoo (S)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I was so moved by Neil Genzlinger's ''Thanks for Nothing but a Lesson in Life'' (Jersey, Aug. 6), that I was prompted to respond.</p>
        <p>His story is a sad commentary on the world today. There could be several reasons he never heard from the people who found his money. Education being what it is, they may have been unable to read the articles that contained the clues. If the money was spent on drugs it is unlikely that they would remember to thank him when they woke from their stupor. We live in a society where women throw their newborn children into garbage cans, so don't expect them to write a thank you note to a stranger.</p>

        <p>Enough cynicism. The real reason I am writing is to thank him for speaking up for animals and for bringing the Popcorn Park Zoo to the attention of others who might be concerned about the plight of those forgotten creatures.</p>
        <p>I may not actually visit the zoo because I see and help so many unwanted and abused animals in my local area, but I will send them a $100 donation in lieu of the hundred Mr. Genzlinger lost.</p>
