        <p>BERNARD SCHWARTZ has spent much of his life as one of the nation's most revered chief executives. He devoted year after consistent year to delivering record returns while building the Loral Corporation into a top military contractor.</p>
        <p>At 74, Mr. Schwartz could well afford to bask in retirement. Instead, he has taken on one of the biggest gambles of his career, starting Globalstar, an international wireless telephone service that is covering the globe with 48 satellites.</p>
        <p>That gamble, shadowed by the failure last year of the Iridium satellite telephone system, now looks like another long shot: Wall Street is up in arms, a bank loan is in default and his junk bonds recently traded at less than 30 cents on the dollar. His woes are, in turn, casting doubt on the prospects for Teledesic, the satellite telecommunications venture backed by Craig McCaw, the cellular telephone entrepreneur.</p>
        <p>''The way the capital markets have been burned, you are really up against a wall of skepticism,'' said Les Levi, an analyst at Chase Securities. ''This is a pretty nasty sector.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schwartz, however, says he is close to success and far from retirement. ''Satellite communications,'' he said, ''is one of the growth industries that not only will show huge business success but be part of the forces shaping the way humans beings live in the future.''</p>
        <p>In the United States, Globalstar went into service in March. Loral, having sold off its military businesses and renamed itself Loral Space and Communications, owns 42 percent of it. Mr. Schwartz remains chairman of both companies.</p>
        <p>Globalstar, based in San Jose, Calif., is in many respects like Iridium, Motorola's  global satellite telephone system that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last August. Globalstar, with simpler technology and more durable satellites, is less expensive to users, although far more expensive than standard cellular service.</p>
        <p>But things have not gone as planned. Customers, put off by handsets costing $700 to $1,200 and charges of $1 to $1.70 a minute -- often more abroad -- are staying away. The service is also just becoming available in countries like Russia and China.</p>
        <p>Last October, Mr. Schwartz told financial analysts that Globalstar would have 500,000 subscribers and $500 million in revenue this year. So far, though, it has 13,000 subscribers and, for the first half of the year, only $2 million in revenue.</p>
        <p>What went wrong?</p>
        <p>''Not much,'' Mr. Schwartz contended in an interview from his office in Manhattan. It is just that his plan is taking longer to execute: ''The biggest impact was the Iridium bankruptcy, which put off the buying public and gave us the need to overcome the Iridium syndrome,'' he said. Press reports  predicting Globalstar's bankruptcy have also hurt, he added.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schwartz said he momentarily considered bankruptcy, but only because an executive has to look at all options.</p>
        <p>And what about the numbers he gave out? He says that they were not meant as projections and, besides, Globalstar's sales will reach an annual rate of $400 million to $500 million by the end of next year. ''You could say, therefore, that we may be a year out of position against that original business model,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schwartz, however, confirms that, without additional financing or a sudden jump in sales, Globalstar will run out of cash in March. Its condition would be worse but for a strategic move that Mr. Schwartz made in late June. He drew down a $250 million bank line of credit, then defaulted, relying on a legal agreement that forced  other investors who had guaranteed the loan to repay it. Some of the largest ones, like Lockheed Martin, Qualcomm and Loral, have done so, but not happily.</p>
        <p>Lockheed Martin, which is negotiating with Loral over the repayment, refused to comment, but Mr. Schwartz is willing. Globalstar has already given Lockheed generous compensation, in rights to buy stock, for the loan guarantee, he said. ''I don't know why, to be candid with you, it's newsworthy that Lockheed Martin is upset,'' he said. ''The people in hell want ice water. It's not something people take notice of.''</p>
        <p>Many shareholders have suffered as well.  In late January, Globalstar, which was already publicly traded, sold an additional $268 million in stock at $35 a share. On Feb. 23, Mr. Schwartz told analysts and investors that handset deliveries were running late, and on May 8, the company disclosed that sales were well behind the expected pace.  The shares closed on Friday at $10.50, up $1.38 on news of expanded coverage in Latin America. Mr. Schwartz said that when the  offering was made, he had no idea that sales were slow.</p>
        <p>As far as Globalstar has gone based on Mr. Schwartz's reputation, the measures he has taken to keep it solvent could hurt his ability to raise more money. ''Each time you burn someone, it makes it that much harder the next time,'' said Armand Musey, an analyst at Banc of America Securities, referring to the credit line default. ''It was not illegal, but was an act of desperation, and is viewed as somewhat of a dirty trick.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schwartz started building his new empire in about 1990, when Loral bought the satellite manufacturing operations of Ford Aerospace. Loral and several partners formed Globalstar in 1991 and sold stock to the public in 1995. With the cold war over, Mr. Schwartz sold Loral's military businesses to Lockheed Martin the next year. In 1997, Loral added a fleet of telecommunications satellites from AT&amp;T. While Globalstar operates the mobile telephone service, Loral makes several types of satellites and operates those handling telecommunications.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schwartz dismissed worries that Globalstar would run out of cash, saying he could go back to his partners for more capital next year. ''We believe Globalstar is in a very attractive, viable market, in which we have the only solution,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But a major partner, Qualcomm, which also supplies equipment, has had to pay back $22 million of the bank loan and is owed about $608 million. So Qualcomm is making no promises about putting up more money.</p>
        <p>''I'm sure we will be approached,'' said Julie Cunningham, Qualcomm's senior vice president for investor relations. ''We would need to look at the specific business plan and see what other partners are putting in.''</p>
        <p>Investors are watching to see how Mr. Schwartz handles Globalstar's next challenge, in the form of a $500 million loan from Banc of America. The bank can demand immediate repayment and assume ownership of two satellites if Globalstar does not have $100 million in revenue for the year ending next March 31, a goal that Mr. Schwartz says is unlikely to be met.</p>
        <p>Bond holders, meanwhile, owed $1.4 billion, anticipate losing much of their money, said Mr. Levi, the analyst. Judging from Globalstar's outlook, he said, ''It is very likely they will default on their public high-yield notes.''</p>
        <p>The bonds have been trading at 25 to 29 cents on the dollar. Mr. Schwartz said the bond payments would be met, and the bank loan dealt with before it comes due.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schwartz is optimistic that once Globalstar attracts more customers over the next six months, financial support for satellite telephone service will flourish.</p>
        <p>But investors might have a longer memory than he supposes, as Roger Rusch, who heads TelAstra, a consulting firm in Palos Verdes, Calif., suggested. ''The satellite industry has gotten a black eye,'' Mr. Rusch said. ''People are going to be reluctant to get involved in these things, because they think they've been led down a path where success is implied and not delivered.''</p>
