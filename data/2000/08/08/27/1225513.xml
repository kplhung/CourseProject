        <p>To the Editor: I recently returned from a literary trip to Ireland to celebrate Yeats's birthday (June 13) and Bloomsday (June 16), and Gort, ''Easy to Miss, Hard to Leave'' (July 9), was our first destination.</p>
        <p>Dan Barry assumes that an automobile is needed. If you are reluctant to drive on the left on narrow and often unmarked roads frequently traveled by monstrous tour buses, as my wife and I were, there are three alternatives.</p>
        <p>First, Bus Eireann, which runs between Shannon and Galway, will stop in front of the Lady Gregory Hotel upon request, where a taxi can be rented. Second, you can continue on to Galway and take one of the many tour buses there to the Burren and the Cliffs of Moher. To see Gort, and especially Thoor Ballylee, as we wished, you must hire a driver. We were unable, after exhaustive searches of the Web, to find one before our trip. Fortunately, upon our arrival at the Galway Jury's Inn, we found one slender sheet offering such a service by David Hogan  (dove@broker.assurelink.ie).</p>
        <p>He's a native Galwegian who knows the local sights and back roads. We were able to visit all the places mentioned in both articles on Gort and the Burren, ''Rare Flowers and Ruined Choirs'' (July 9), in one exhilarating day, including lunch at the Lady Gregory Hotel and tea at Dave's house in Kinvara.</p>
