        <p>WHEN Morton Schindel began his career, he had no strategies for creating an international company from the one-man shop that was the beginning of Weston Woods, a children's video and film company. But there were clues in his past that pointed to his ability to live on a creative and intuitive edge.</p>
        <p>During the 1940's, Mr. Schindel was found to have tuberculosis, which at that time was treatable only with long-term rest.</p>
        <p>''So what do I do now?'' the 81-year-old Weston resident remembered asking himself. Shortly before his illness was diagnosed, Mr. Schindel had graduated from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business. But a career in business was deemed too strenuous for his health, so his doctor suggested that a life as an artist would be less taxing.</p>
        <p>He didn't believe he had the talent to pursue a career as an illustrator or painter, but he did like taking photographs, which led him to look for production work in New York City. Whether it was good fortune or fate, Mr. Schindel stumbled into the educational film industry. While he had no credentials in film, he said, ''I realized the men making the films didn't have the credentials as educators.'' So he enrolled in Columbia University's Teachers College to study curriculum development and began experimenting with audio-visual techniques.</p>
        <p>After graduating in 1949, he held film jobs, including a two-year stint in Turkey working for the United States government, making educational films to help European countries rebuild after World War II.</p>
        <p>While overseas, he became interested in how still photographs and audio could be used to tell a story.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schindel would later improve upon this technique, creating a shooting style he called iconographic, where the camera remains stationary and the pictures move. When he returned to the United States, however, he couldn't find work or grant money to continue the kind of work he was doing in Europe.</p>
        <p>But he found a way to redirect his work when he ventured into the children's section of the New York Public Library and discovered beautifully illustrated classic children's books, such as Robert McCloskey's ''Make Way for Ducklings.''</p>
        <p>''While photographing them, I discovered new details in the illustrations and I thought: 'Maybe you can take good literature and make films from them,' '' he said.</p>
        <p>This led to the formation of his company, Weston Woods, and to the production of more than 300 films and 450 filmstrips, video and audio cassettes that have been distributed in more than 50,000 schools and libraries in the United States  over the past four decades. Besides McCloskey's classic ''Ducklings,'' Weston Woods has also produced Ezra Jack Keats's ''Snowy Day,'' marking the company's entry into animation in 1964, and the Academy Award-nominated short ''Doctor De Soto.''</p>
        <p>To reach more children in urban and rural locations, Weston Woods hit the road in the 1960's. ''I was watching kids pile off a school bus one day and the next thing I knew I bought one for $500, hired a designer and turned it into a theater,'' he said.</p>
        <p>There are those who credit Mr. Schindel with creating the children's educational entertainment industry. Caroline Ward, head of children's services at the Ferguson Library in Stamford, and formerly president of the children's services division at the American Library Association, recently presented Mr. Schindel with the group's lifetime achievement award. ''While children's media has become so commercialized, he's kept to his hard line of standards,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Four years ago Weston Woods was acquired by Scholastic Inc., the children's publishing and media company. It was a deal that Mr. Schindel could never have imagined when he borrowed $1,500 to start his company in 1954, putting up as collateral all his film negatives, which had cost $35,000 to produce. ''I remember looking out the window at the time and seeing the woods,'' he said. ''I had used all my money, had a mortgage, a family, and I needed to promote and distribute the products. I thought: 'I'm in the woods and I have to figure a way out'.'' Hence, the name Weston Woods.</p>
        <p>While the company was struggling, its founder and its small staff were forging relationship with schools and libraries. Often, Mr. Schindel would send out filmstrips and audio packages before payments were received or send replacements, at the company's expense, for records that had warped from sitting too long in a library's storage room. And when customers called, he usually got back to them personally.</p>
        <p>So when the federal government increased funding for audio-visual educational material in 1968, Weston Woods was positioned to take advantage. Attracted by the government aid, there were many more companies selling videos to schools and libraries by the early 1980's, said Linda Lee, vice president and general manager of Weston Woods.</p>
        <p>Despite the competition, Ms. Lee said, Weston Woods stuck to its original vision: producing educational material based on classic children's literature that would motivate children to read. When the school and library funding dried up a few years later, competitors followed the cash, which had gone into producing health and sex education material, Ms. Lee said. ''But we continued to do what we were doing and buy up as many rights as we could.''</p>
        <p>The time Weston Woods used to solidify its position has paid off.</p>
        <p>Budgets for schools and library material increased an average of 7 percent in 1999, according to The Library Journal's annual budget survey. ''We're in times of prosperity and it helps when there's a greater spotlight on literacy programs,'' said Shannon Maughan, children's audio and video editor at Publishers Weekly, an industry trade publication.</p>
        <p>If government funding should slow, Weston Woods has more distribution channels than it did when it was an independent entity, including television, book clubs, retail and the Internet. ''We want to bring back the home video line, and children's television is back in vogue,'' Ms. Lee said.</p>
        <p>Scholastic won't disclose Weston Woods earnings, but sales have been growing an average of 15 percent annually since 1997, Ms. Lee said. It has partly been buoyed by stronger educational video sales, which have been growing nearly 5 percent a year, according to the research firm Simba. This represents only a $128 million slice of the $1.2 billion electronic education market. Another positive trend is the increase in children's book sales: they are projected to rise 17.5 percent by the end of 2002, totaling nearly $3.1 billion, according to the Book Industry Study Group.</p>
        <p>Though times are good and children's literature is hot -- thanks to such runaway hits as Scholastic's Harry Potter series -- the question remains whether Weston Woods can maintain its standards now that it has to answer to shareholders. This is something Mr. Schindel grappled with and why he insisted on such a long courtship before selling the company.</p>
        <p>What cinched the deal between Weston Woods and Scholastic had nothing to do with finances. Instead, it centered around creating a relationship between Richard Robinson, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Scholastic, and Mr. Schindel. They worked in the same industries and had similar interests. ''I get a kick that we came together as friends,'' Mr. Schindel said. ''So when the time came to pick a successor, there were no lawyers or boardroom meetings -- just the passing of notes between friends.''</p>
        <p>In addition, the timing seemed right. ''I just didn't want to wait until I had a gun to my head,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schindel certainly has not slowed down any. He says he is a workaholic, putting in 16 hours a day, though he doesn't consider it work, because he loves what he does.</p>
        <p>This pace is likely to continue, as long as he stays on as consultant to Weston Woods and continues to develop the Weston Woods Institute, a nonprofit he started to experiment with storytelling in various media.</p>
        <p>''I'm a lucky man,'' he said.</p>
