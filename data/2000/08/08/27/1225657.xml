        <p>What is missing from the debate about a proposed senior-housing development in Melville [''Town Sees Pressure by Suffolk on Houses,'' Aug. 20] is the unquestionable need for homes for low-income families.</p>
        <p>The Town of Huntington has identified nearly 6,000 households that are at or below 30 percent of the median income. The town's plan repeatedly acknowledges that affordable rental housing is insufficient to meet the needs of these families, and notes that more than 70 percent of existing rental housing is substandard, rendering the units less than fully habitable.</p>

        <p>What is missing from the debate about a proposed senior-housing development in Melville [''Town Sees Pressure by Suffolk on Houses,'' Aug. 20] is the unquestionable need for homes for low-income families.</p>
        <p>The Town of Huntington has identified nearly 6,000 households that are at or below 30 percent of the median income. The town's plan repeatedly acknowledges that affordable rental housing is insufficient to meet the needs of these families, and notes that more than 70 percent of existing rental housing is substandard, rendering the units less than fully habitable.</p>
        <p>The town's consolidated plan is required by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, in return for which the town receives more than a million dollars a year, primarily to provide decent housing for residents of low and moderate income.</p>
        <p>It is a shame that of the 1,375 units proposed at the Melville site, none will be for low-income families. Instead, most of the prospective residents will be seniors moving from large homes they no longer need, seniors in a position to pay $175,000 to $350,000.</p>
        <p>The developer purchased this property from the state; it was previously a mental health facility, providing housing and other services to the poorest mentally ill individuals. It is ironic that poor families and individuals will not be able to reside in this handsome new community.</p>
        <p>The owner has no entitlement to develop the property as it sees fit. Current zoning guidelines for the 382-acre site allow approximately 190 units, requiring the developer to apply for a variance to build the 1,375 units proposed.</p>
        <p>The town's responsibility to meet the housing needs of its low-income families require it to refuse the developer's request -- not because senior housing is inappropriate and not because the school district might be overburdened, but because there are families in Huntington who are without decent housing.</p>
        <p>This is the most compelling need of all.</p>
