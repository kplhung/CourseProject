        <p>IN Alain Berliner's forgettable ''Passion of Mind,'' a man spies an incriminating cassette on the stereo of his new girlfriend and forces her to confess: sometimes when the dog bites or the bee stings, she pops in ''The Sound of Music'' and sings along to ''My Favorite Things.''</p>
        <p>Oh, the poor embarrassed fans of ''The Sound of Music,'' left to serenade the raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens in the privacy of their bathtubs and cars. That is, until last summer, when a London theater producer had the idea to show the 1965 movie musical, starring Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer, at London's Prince Charles Cinema. With subtitled lyrics for those few who don't know the words by heart, this was no ordinary revival house offering. It was a ''Rocky Horror Picture Show'' without the attitude. With an M.C. to warm up the crowd (''Boo the Nazis!''  ''Hiss the Baroness!''), a costume contest at intermission and plenty of beer on tap, ''Sing-A-Long-A Sound of Music'' has been a must on the social calendars of gay men as well as women over 30. But you're just as likely to see groups of off-duty cab drivers, schoolchildren and husbands among the motley congregation of fans. At the very beginning, when the camera searches the Alps and Maria comes into view, the hall explodes into cheers (''Look, it's her!'' ''Julie!'' ''Hi, Julie!''). And when she bursts into her first chorus of ''The Hills Are Alive,'' they sing along, and on through giddy octaves of ''Do-Re-Mi'' and teary falsettos for ''Edelweiss,'' every voice making itself heard in the dark of the theater.</p>

And when she bursts into her first chorus of ''The Hills Are Alive,'' they sing along, and on through giddy octaves of ''Do-Re-Mi'' and teary falsettos for ''Edelweiss,'' every voice making itself heard in the dark of the theater.</p>
        <p>The producers are hoping now that ''Sing-A-Long-A Sound of Music'' (or, ''Sing-A-Long Sound of Music,'' as it will be called in its American incarnation) will find a permanent New York home and go on to tour the United States after opening on Sept. 7 at the Ziegfeld Theater in Manhattan. For the film's 35th anniversary, RCA is reissuing a digitally remastered soundtrack and an all-new double-CD collector's edition this month, while 20th Century Fox is re-releasing the video, along with a new DVD version.</p>
        <p>That there is still this much enthusiasm for ''The Sound of Music'' might have surprised some critics who reviewed it when it opened. In The New York Times, Bosley Crowther was respectfully dismissive. In The New Yorker, Brendan Gill dared to label it a ''pit of sticky-sweet whipped cream,'' while Pauline Kael, writing in McCall's at the time, called it a ''sugar-coated lie.'' The fans who wrote in to scold her for the review liked to think that that was what cost her the job soon thereafter.</p>
        <p>But the audience would decide this one. As soon as the film opened, mothers around the world began naming their baby girls Liesl after the celluloid von Trapp family's eldest daughter; marrying couples re-enacted Maria and the Captain's dance; women of all ages chopped off their hair a la Julie Andrews, and Myra Franklin, a fortyish widow, became a regular at a movie theater in Wales, a daily habit that would earn her a spot in the Guiness Book of World Records for having seen the movie 940 times.</p>
        <p>Directed by Robert Wise with music and lyrics by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II, ''The Sound of Music'' received 10 Oscar nominations, took home 5 (including best picture) and in some cases ran in the theaters for several years, breaking box-office records around the world. The film that had saved a near-bankrupt 20th Century Fox was nicknamed ''The Sound of Money'' and has since become not only the second most successful movie musical, after ''Grease,'' but also one of the top 100 grossing films of all time.</p>
        <p>From the very beginning, not only jaded film critics asked, ''Why?'' In 1966, The New York Times Magazine ran an article headlined, ''Biggest Money-Making Movie of All Time -- How Come?'' Was it the catchy tunes? The charmingly high-spirited nun? The fairy-tale European backdrop? The timeless lessons of right and wrong, God and country, self-knowledge and love?</p>
        <p>One thing seems clear: like it or not, ''The Sound of Music'' is not going away. David J. Foster, the producer of the New York ''Sing-A-Long,'' said: ''I don't remember having seen it as a child, but when I went to the 'Sing-A-Long-A,' I found I remembered all the words, I knew it so well. Maybe the human genome project is going to find a 'Sound of Music' gene has developed in the last 35 years.''</p>
        <p>Well, it is hard to think of another film that has so thoroughly penetrated the popular culture. Over the years, songs like ''Climb Ev'ry Mountain'' and ''My Favorite Things'' have been recorded by artists ranging from the Supremes to John Coltrane. As fodder for commercials, more than 30 television shows and 40 films, ''Sound of Music'' references in other media began showing up as early as 1966, with Woody Allen's ''What's Up, Tiger Lily?'' And references have continued to resurface regularly: in Kevin Costner's ''Postman'' (1997); in another of Mr. Allen's movies,''Everyone Says I Love You'' (1996); in the hip indie hit ''The Opposite of Sex'' (1998); in last year's smash, ''The Sixth Sense''; and in Lars von Trier's ''Dancer in the Dark,'' which won the Palme d'Or for best film at this year's Cannes International Film Festival and which has been picked to open the New York Film Festival next month.</p>
        <p>Theodore S. Chapin, president of the Rodgers and Hammerstein Organization, which oversees the rights to the songs, says it tries to make sure they are used in good, loving fun. This would include, apparently, Chevy Chase spoofing ''The Hills Are Alive'' in ''National Lampoon's European Vacation'' (1985) or a half-dozen songs on the soundtrack of Roland Joffe's ''Goodbye, Lover,'' where the music functions as an inside joke, equal parts twisted and camp.</p>
        <p>In that 1999 black comedy, Ellen DeGeneres is investigating a murder and notices a suspicious tape in the bookcase of a crime scene. ''I don't like it,'' she tells her partner. ''I don't trust anybody over 10 who listens to 'The Sound of Music.' '' Later, sorting laundry while singing along to ''My Favorite Things,'' Patricia Arquette finds a condom in her husband's pocket. When she tells him she loves him on his way out the door for a tryst, he leaves, breaking out into a chorus of ''I Must Have Done Something Good'' in the hallway. She forces him and his lover off the road and over a cliff to a track of ''So Long, Farewell,'' and rouses herself the next morning with a spirited sing-along to ''I Have Confidence.''</p>
        <p>While ''The Sound of Music'' has been especially popular in Anglophone countries, ''La Melodie du Bonheur,'' (France), ''The Rebel Novice Nun'' (Mexico) and, in an extremely literal translation, ''Fairy Music Blow Fragrant Place, Place Hear'' (Hong Kong) have won audiences everywhere -- except, it seems, in Germany and Austria.</p>
        <p>The screenwriter Ernest Lehman's '' Sound of Music'' was adapted from the 1959 Broadway musical starring Mary Martin, which in turn had been based on the German hit film ''Die Trapp Familie'' (1956).</p>
        <p>That film played down the political side of the story, in which the real-life Austrian family, the von Trapps, fled the Nazis in search of political freedom and opportunity in America, becoming international music stars in the process. The focus was more on the largely biographical side of the tale, that of a lovable, bumbling nun who found her true calling as the family governess, then the wife of the widowed Captain von Trapp and the stepmother of his seven children.</p>
        <p>The 1965 film version was released by Fox in Munich, where the distributor decided to end the film at the wedding scene, before the von Trapps escape over the Alps, leaving their beloved Austria behind. Once the Hollywood office got wind of the unauthorized cut and ordered the original ending restored, the film bombed in Germany.</p>
        <p>When it opened in Salzburg, audiences there dismissed it as Hollywood kitsch, with Austrian characters speaking in dubbed north German accents and passing off Rodgers and Hammerstein as native folk songs.</p>
        <p>Most Austrians still have never seen the film, which was shot on location in Salzburg. But Martin Uitz, the director of tourism there, says that 70 percent of the non-European tourists who journey to Salzburg, the birthplace of Mozart and the home of one of the most prestigious music festivals in the world, cite ''The Sound of Music'' as the primary reason for their visit.</p>
        <p>''Many Austrians are not aware of the message that the 'Sound of Music' has sent to the world in the past 35 years,'' Mr. Uitz said, ''that Austrians are the most charming people you could dream of.''</p>
        <p>Only in the last 10 years, the Austrian government has given medals to the real von Trapp children, and to the actors who played them, for their public relations work. Yet Mr. Uitz believes that the film has long been ''one of the best ambassadors Austria ever had,'' notably in recent times, when his government has had a bit of an image problem with members of Jorg Haider's anti-immigrant Freedom Party jockeying for power.</p>
        <p>During the Reagan administration, the White house greeted the Austrian ambassador with a rousing chorus of ''Edelweiss.'' The protocol department apparently hadn't realized that not only was the song not his country's national anthem, but that it also was not an old Austrian folksong, as many people still believe. It was the last tune that Rodgers and Hammerstein ever wrote together. The confusion continues to this day: Mr. Uitz says that American tourists are heard to hum ''Edelweiss'' on one of the competing 'Sound of Music' bus tours in Salzburg, to the bemusement of the locals. And the city's tourist office doesn't help matters by using a snippet of the song from the movie's soundtrack on its telephone information line.</p>
        <p>If ''The Sound of Music'' has been an unwitting ambassador for Austria, it is Liesl, in real life known as Charmian Carr, who has long been the spokeswoman for the film. While its stars, Ms. Andrews and Mr. Plummer, went on to have long careers, and some of the other siblings continued to act, Fox sent Ms. Carr on the road to use up some of her seven-year contract. Eventually she married a dentist and moved to Encino, Calif., where she became an interior decorator.</p>
        <p>Being Liesl, however, has remained a part-time job. In ''Forever Liesl,'' a memoir published this year, Ms. Carr reveals that some of the on-screen siblings are still friends, like distant cousins who spent an unforgettable childhood summer abroad,  and keep in touch for the memories. But mostly she writes about the impact that her role had on her life, sharing excerpts of letters she has received over the years from ardent fans. ''I still get letters,'' she said by phone from California. ''People tell me they often watch the film when they're feeling depressed, and it makes them feel better.'' (One of those people was the singer Michael Jackson, who even hired her to decorate his house in the 80's.)</p>
        <p>But there are plenty of everyday stories of those who have gotten through their own personal thunderstorms by singing a few sotto voce bars of ''My Favorite Things.'' For those of us who grew up acting out ''The Sound of Music'' in our bedrooms, ''Edelweiss'' is a lullaby, ''The Hills Are Alive'' an inspirational hymn, ''Sixteen Going on Seventeen'' a souvenir of first love, ''Climb Ev'ry Mountain'' a lifelong mantra.</p>
        <p>PERHAPS that's what makes understandable Mr. von Trier's use of ''The Sound of Music'' to express emotional extremes in ''Dancer in the Dark.'' In his latest film, Bjork plays Selma, a near-blind Czech immigrant in rural America saving money from her factory job to give her only son an operation for the hereditary condition. After work, she rehearses the role of Maria in a community theater production, struggling to hit the right notes and remember her lines.</p>
        <p>But Selma draws her moral courage from musicals -- where, she says, nothing bad ever happens. She daydreams on the job, turning the sounds of the factory equipment into whimsical musical sequences -- written and performed by Bjork -- in which her eyes have never failed her, her voice is high and strong, and all is right in her world.</p>
        <p>But one of the film's final musical numbers takes place in the real world -- a reprise of ''My Favorite Things,'' sung while Selma awaits her fate in prison, accused of murder. It's a reflex that makes her reach out for the song; as she chokes out a few bars, somehow through the cracks in her voice seeps a brief flash of joy. A sugar-coated lie that won't rescue her. But a last sweet reprieve before it all turns back to noise; a wish before the music stops.</p>
