        <p>Andrew E Nelson letter on R J Smith's August 6 article on rap music fans questions depiction of those in photographs as being out of control (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The gallery of photographs on the first pages of RJ Smith's article (Aug. 6) depicted young fans waiting for the wristbands that would allow them to purchase tickets for a Limp Bizkit concert in Detroit. A motley lot they are -- pimpled, puffy, tattooed, posing and clowning for the camera. The caption, however, describes the group as ''fast, white and out of control.'' Out of control? These are teenagers, and the overriding emotion in the images is self-consciousness. Out of control? They're standing in line.</p>
        <p>Smith is on the mark when he writes about the culture of white, Midwestern boredom that produced Eminem, Kid Rock, the Insane Clown Posse. His writing about professional wrestling is interesting as well.</p>
        <p>What is unclear is any particular connection between the enjoyment of the prurient theater of professional wrestling and antisocial behavior away from the ring. Or for that matter, between enjoying the thunderous tumult of Kid Rock or Limp Bizkit and deciding to break stuff.</p>
        <p>Jimmy Iovine points to the steady downward slide of national crime statistics. Perhaps the violent and sexualized playacting of wrestling and rapping and the chance to careen around a mosh pit serve as a sort of safety valve, an Elizabethan carnival where Misrule is, temporarily, king.</p>
