        <p>WHEN Herman Raucher got a call from David Kirshenbaum and Hunter Foster about creating a stage musical from his 1971 film ''Summer of '42,'' Mr. Raucher said he didn't give it much thought.</p>
        <p>''About 20 years ago somebody with Broadway credits optioned it and nothing came from it,'' said Mr. Raucher in a telephone conversation from his home in the Cos Cob section of Greenwich. ''Next thing I know, they're sending me scripts.''</p>

        <p>WHEN Herman Raucher got a call from David Kirshenbaum and Hunter Foster about creating a stage musical from his 1971 film ''Summer of '42,'' Mr. Raucher said he didn't give it much thought.</p>
        <p>''About 20 years ago somebody with Broadway credits optioned it and nothing came from it,'' said Mr. Raucher in a telephone conversation from his home in the Cos Cob section of Greenwich. ''Next thing I know, they're sending me scripts.''</p>
        <p>To Mr. Raucher's pleasant surprise, however, ''Summer of '42'' opened Aug. 10 at Goodspeed-at-Chester/The Norma Terris Theater, where it continues through Sept. 10 (it was extended for a week).</p>
        <p>And Mr. Raucher's just as pleased with himself for not meddling with the unknown team in the process of musicalizing his most famous work.</p>
        <p>''It's hard to step away, but you have to,'' he said. ''David and Hunter both showed a lot of respect for my work, so I trusted them to be on top of it. I didn't want to hang around like the unburied dead.''</p>
        <p>''Summer of '42'' was a sleeper hit when it came out in 1971. It is a nostalgic story of a teenage boy's loss of innocence one summer after becoming infatuated with a war bride on an island off New England. Its only star was Jennifer O'Neill as Dorothy, the older woman. It is a movie long on atmosphere, created in large measure by Michel Legrand's Oscar-winning score.</p>
        <p>Ryan Driscoll, a high school senior from Deep River, makes his professional debut at the Norma Terris as Hermie, the teen-age leading character. Idina Menzel, who was nominated for a Tony for the role of Maureen in ''Rent,'' plays Dorothy.</p>
        <p>Gabriel Barre directs the cast, which also includes Jason Marcus (Benjie), Matt Farnsworth (Pete), Jeanne Goodman (Gloria), Brett Tabisel (Oscy), Celia Keenan-Bolger (Aggie), Megan Walker (Miriam) and Bill Kux (Mr. Sanders/Walter Winchell).</p>
        <p>While audiences may recall the Hermie-Dorothy relationship more than the rest of the film, Mr. Raucher said it was not the impetus for his writing the screenplay. ''It was in honor of Oscy, who was killed in Korea on my birthday in 1952,'' he said. ''I've never been able to celebrate my birthday since then. I wrote the script in 10 days. It was a cathartic experience.'' In the picture, Oscy is Hermie's best friend. It took a bit longer to sell, he said. ''Eventually Bob Mulligan, who came from live television like me, got a million dollars to direct it. He did an incredible job. I still don't know where he found those little Cape Cod houses in Southern California,'' said Mr. Raucher, who based the story on his own experience on Nantucket when he was 14 years old (''The producers insisted on making Hermie 15,'' he said.).</p>
        <p>Since the film was to be produced on such a low budget, Mr. Raucher accepted a percentage of the film's profits in lieu of cash up front. It was the best business decision he ever made. ''At first it only played in art houses, because it wasn't supposed to do much business,'' he said. ''But it took off.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Raucher -- who has written for the theater, television and movies -- was surprised that his little story made such a successful film. His screenplay was nominated for an Oscar. But Mr. Raucher lost to Paddy Chayefsky, who wrote ''The Hospital,'' starring George C. Scott. ''Paddy told me that night, if you want to win an Oscar, write a two-minute speech for Georgie Scott.''</p>
        <p>The success of the movie also prompted a wave of letters from women saying they were the real Dorothy. One, however, seemed genuine to Mr. Raucher. ''It had the same handwriting as in the note she left me, which was in one of the last scenes of the movie. It was postmarked Ohio, with no address. I think that really was from Dorothy. She said she was worried about me.''</p>
        <p>It was the last Mr. Raucher heard from the woman. ''She wrote that the ghosts of that time were better left alone.''</p>
        <p>''Summer of '42'' continues through Sept. 10 at Goodspeed-at-Chester/The Norma Terris Theater (North Main Street, Chester; 860-873-8668). Tickets are $29. To learn more about Goodspeed Opera House, visit its Web site: (www.goodspeed.org).</p>
