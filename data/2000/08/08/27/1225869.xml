        <p>Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi are going into the twilight of their careers. But at least for one morning, the constant search for America's future ended up on Court 10 during Arthur Ashe Kids Day.</p>
        <p>Armed with wild-card entries into the United States Open, the neophytes Mardy Fish, Andy Roddick and Phillip King were helping children through some playful hitting drills. When the matches begin tomorrow, all three will be riding part of the next-wave niche together. Instead of feeling threatened by one another, most of the young players practice together. In some cases, they share apartments in Florida.</p>
        <p>''I think when you start doing well, and there's not that many guys doing well with you, that's when you might feel some pressure,'' Fish said. ''But when you get other guys in the same situation, those are the ones who can push you to succeed. It's a lot harder when you're all alone.''</p>
        <p>Fish, Roddick and King have all scaled the ranking this year. In just a couple of weeks, Roddick has moved through the 400's and is currently ranked 338. King is ranked 313, while Fish is No. 348. Although all three are miles away from fame (and first-class accommodations), they do not mind having their games dissected for traces of Sampras- and Agassi-like talents.</p>
        <p>''To look at Andy Roddick -- and he has an awesome serve -- to say his serve is Sampras-like is an honor to him,'' Fish said. ''Sampras has one of the best serves ever. So to even be associated with that name for anyone is really cool.''</p>
