        <p>''Would the last New Yorker heading out of town before Labor Day please leave the lights on for the tourists?''</p>
        <p>O.K., maybe that sign hasn't been posted on the city's bridges and tunnels. But as the mad dash begins to go somewhere, anywhere, during these doggiest of dog days, it might not be a bad idea.</p>
        <p>This is the week when many New Yorkers succumb to a collective urge to scram from the steaming metropolis. And to those left behind, for better or worse, it is perhaps the quietest week of the year.</p>
        <p>It is a week when some people are ashamed to show their face to the doorman, only to find that he is off to Maine. It is a week when the only buzz in town seems to come from mosquitoes.</p>
        <p>The Midsummer Night Swing at Lincoln Center is over. So are the Monday movies in Bryant Park. Summerstage in Central Park ended on Aug. 19, as did the Celebrate Brooklyn festival. The New York Philharmonic free outdoor concert series ends today, as does Lincoln Center Out-of-Doors. The Mostly Mozart Festival? That wrapped up on Aug. 22. Even the downtown Fringe Festival ends tonight.</p>
        <p>Of course, not everyone left behind this week is whining. Not in public, anyway. Some New Yorkers say it is a golden time, when restaurants and parks are uncrowded and parking spots are plentiful.</p>
        <p>But while you can get into that hot restaurant, you might find yourself supping beside auto workers from Dusseldorf instead of urban glitterati.  You can get a cab at any hour, but where do you go in it?</p>
        <p>''It's losers' week,'' said Michael Musto, the Village Voice gossip columnist famous for chronicling the city's denizens of the night. Mr. Musto, with his thick glasses and perpetually rumpled hair, can be spotted many evenings, pen in hand, observing the hip at happenings around town.</p>
        <p>''Suddenly they feel like 'We have to go away this week, no matter what it takes,' '' he said. Being among the few in one's social circle to stay in town, he said, ''only exacerbates the victimization of feeling left behind.''</p>
        <p>''You start getting desperate, thinking of some trip to take,'' Mr. Musto said. ''I mean, should we go to Dollywood? Let's just go somewhere.''</p>
        <p>Stay in town and hit the nightclubs, he said, and ''you definitely feel like you have a giant 'loser' tattooed on your forehead.''</p>
        <p>Cindy Chupack, 35, a television writer and producer who owns a home in Los Angeles and rents one in Greenwich Village, began spending time in New York a few years back as a writer and an executive producer of the HBO series ''Sex and the City.''</p>
        <p>She knows the drill: during the last week in August you can get into a trendy restaurant like Nobu at the last minute without a reservation. ''And if you do run into someone, and they make you feel like a loser for being in the city,'' she said, ''well, they are in the city, too. So anyone who sights you is also equally culpable of not having plans.</p>
        <p>''It's important to be sworn to secrecy about the whole thing, or maybe even ignore each other and just enjoy your meal.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Chupack is the creator and executive producer of ''Madigan Men,'' a forthcoming television comedy starring Gabriel Byrne as an Irish architect living in New York with his father and son. She begins a hectic schedule of filming in the city this week. In her eyes, it's a valid excuse for lingering.</p>
        <p>''At least you don't fear that you're a loser because you don't have a place to go in the Hamptons,'' Ms. Chupack said. ''Nobody can expect me to have a fabulous week anyway.'' Or her crew, for that matter.</p>
        <p>Karen Fahy, a 30-year-old account supervisor at a computer software company and a longtime resident of the Upper East Side, is grateful for any opportunity to get away in late August. This summer, after a dull Memorial Day weekend and an even duller Fourth of July, she is finally making her escape. The big occasion? A year-later wedding reception for some college friends of her boyfriend. Never mind that it's in Austin, Tex.</p>
        <p>Or that ''it will probably be 100 degrees and my hair will frizz like hell,'' said Ms. Fahy, who has a long strawberry-blond mane. ''I'm very excited to just be going anywhere.''</p>
        <p>SO how quiet is it going to be in New York this week? So quiet you can  hear a check drop (along with the names) at Balthazar.</p>
        <p>''If you don't like loneliness, you're in the wrong place at the wrong time,'' said Howard J. Rubenstein, head of one of the city's premier public relations firms, with more than 400 clients, many of them very widely known. Mr. Rubenstein and his wife, Amy, are among those New Yorkers who relish staying in town during these placid days. He doesn't even visit his country home, in Pound Ridge, N.Y., he said, because it's ''too busy'' there.</p>
        <p>''They have church bazaars and fireworks and kiddie rides,'' Mr. Rubenstein said. ''There's more going on in Pound Ridge that week than there is in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''My wife and I walk on Fifth Avenue at 9 o'clock at night, when there should be a ton of lights on,'' said Mr. Rubenstein, who lives on the Upper East Side. ''And there aren't any.''</p>
        <p>This week, of all weeks, he said, New Yorkers ''really bail out, and they bail out early.''</p>
        <p>''I will normally get 50 to 100 phone calls coming into me at the beginning of the week,'' he said. ''And at the end, I might get, oh, five a day.''</p>
        <p>''If you were planning a dinner party at your Manhattan residence, you would have to invite 50 people just to get three couples,'' Mr. Rubenstein added. ''And they'll think you're insulting them. They'll say: 'What does he think, that I'm broke? That I can't go away?' So they might end up not coming, either.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rubenstein said it was a deadly week for caterers, party planners and those who outfit them. And, he said, don't ever give a  party for a child that week. ''It's a bad time to be born,'' he said. ''You should just postpone the birth for the sake of the party.''</p>
        <p>Or as Dennis Wilson, an owner of Wilson &amp; Kreulen, a 10-year-old party planning and catering firm in Manhattan, put it, having a party the last week in August ''is like trying to get people into an ice cream parlor in February.''</p>
        <p>A Manhattan journalist in her 40's learned that lesson a few years ago when a friend tried to give her an end-of-August birthday party. ''We made a list of people to call, and out of 10 or 15 women, all of them were going to be away, except for one person,'' she said. ''So it turned from this incredibly nice thing into something that was really depressing. We decided not to do it at all.''</p>
        <p>Even professionals who maintain listings of what's going on in the city find themselves hard-pressed the last week of August.</p>
        <p>''We will really be scraping the bottom of the barrel to find things to list for that week,'' said Ben Williams, editor in chief of CitySearch.com, a Web site that lists events. ''For example, the Righteous Brothers are playing at the Westbury Music Fair. That kind of stuff.''</p>
        <p>There is, of course, the United States Open tennis tournament, not to mention back-to-school sales and, next weekend, the West Indian American Day Parade and that grand dragapalooza known as Wigstock.</p>
        <p>''It's a big, big time for us girls,'' said Jon Ingle, better known as the Lady Bunny, drag queen about town and the host and founder of Wigstock, which takes place next Sunday in Greenwich Village. ''A lot of people become drag queens on that day.''</p>
        <p>For some, spending this week in the city is a time to quietly take stock of their lives. But the result can be depressing.</p>
        <p>''It can be a real blue period,'' said Benita Gold, 41, who lives on the Upper West Side. ''I happen to really love summer. So Memorial Day is probably the time of the whole year when I feel the most excitedly expectant. And then Labor Day can be a real letdown, not only for what did happen and is over but also for what didn't end up happening.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Gold is the publicist for the Glazier Group, which owns a chain of restaurants including Michael Jordan's Steakhouse, the Monkey Bar and Tapika. Normally, late August is a very slow period, she said, but on Sept. 5 the company is opening a new restaurant on East 12th Street, the Strip House.  The week before Labor Day, the restaurant will be open for ''previews.''</p>
        <p>To make sure there is somebody, anybody, on whom the kitchen can practice, the restaurant will offer a 25 percent discount the entire week. ''If we still don't get enough people in there,'' said Peter Glazier, chief executive of the company, ''we'll pick up the phone and start calling friends.''</p>
        <p>As for those dining hot spots, it's a lot easier to get in but you may not find the usual crowd, or service. Last year, for example, Mr. Musto went to a hot new Belgian place during what he called ''that horrible week.''</p>
        <p>''It was like we didn't have a real waiter. He was like the understudy, or a body double. The service was totally inept. It became like a Marx Brothers movie.''</p>
        <p>Tim Zagat, the publisher of the Zagat Guide, said that while one does run a risk of encountering inferior service during this week, the quality of the food should not suffer much at a good restaurant. ''Yes, the chef might be on vacation,'' he said. ''But in decent restaurants, there's a team of 5 to 20 people working in the kitchen, so if the No. 1 chef is not there, it shouldn't be a significant problem.''</p>
        <p>For many publicists, meanwhile, the week can cut either way. ''It's a P.R. nightmare,'' said Rob Goldstone, founder and president of Oui 2 Public Relations. ''On the one hand, it's a good week to do something, because the media has space to fill. It's a boring week and you can get stuff in. On the other hand, most everything has already been planned in advance and a lot of reporters are going out of town anyway.''</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, one client, an Italian-American comedy duo known as the HaYaDoin' Boys, is putting out a new CD this week. ''They loved the idea that maybe we could own that week,'' Mr. Goldstone said.</p>
        <p>F OR some New Yorkers, this is not only the last chance for a summer vacation, but also for a super-fabulous one and all the bragging rights that come with it. (Never mind that the summer, technically, continues for another few weeks.)</p>
        <p>''There is definitely such a thing as competitive vacationing,'' said the writer Susan Orlean, a longtime New Yorker and something of an authority on how Americans enjoy themselves, or don't.</p>
        <p>''Humans, and in particular New Yorkers, can find a way to be competitive about everything,'' she said. ''So whether you have the most interesting, most exclusive, most enviable vacation plans would fall right into that category of human endeavor, which is, 'How can I somehow be better than other people -- and have more fun?' ''</p>
        <p>In her book ''Saturday Night'' (Replica Books, 1997), Ms. Orlean chronicled the American obsession with having a good time. ''People feel some sort of leisure imperative,'' she said. ''So if you aren't having fun on Saturday night, or New Year's Eve or any of those conventional notions of when you ought to be having fun, you feel bereft.''</p>
        <p>''Even if it doesn't have a name, it's the last week of August, and you're supposed to be doing something fun, not working,'' Ms. Orlean said. ''Of course, all these things are absurd. If you stayed home, you might be lonely. But it's just one more week. It's like not having a date for the prom. Even if you don't have any interest in going, you feel like you've fallen short.''</p>
        <p>Much of this anxiety is linked to class status. As Marni Finkelstein, a research associate and adjunct instructor of urban anthropology at John Jay College, explained, ''The only people that would really be upset about being in the city in August are those that feel that they should be on vacation because everyone else they know or associate with is.''</p>
        <p>She added, ''For those that don't particularly follow the social rules of vacationing or accept the fact that they can't afford to take one, this is hardly an issue.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Finkelstein, who lives in the East Village, will spend this week in town. She also manages a rock band called Banana Fish Zero, but said she would never book the band for any weekend in August and never, ever during any night of this last week.</p>
        <p>Psychotherapists, of course, have long been known to take off in August (a tradition of exodus Judith Rossner addressed in her novel aptly titled ''August''). Mark Sichel and Cindy Kasovitz-Sichel, two Manhattan therapists, used to do just that, taking their vacation the last week of August. But after a  horrible holiday in Quogue in 1988, when it rained all week, they began taking their summer family vacation the first week in July.</p>
        <p>They both find late August to be a busy work time. ''Summer's ending, and people are vulnerable to depression as they switch gears back to work mode,'' Mr. Sichel said. ''Those people who have no plans for that week are particularly vulnerable. This engenders feelings of poor self-esteem, with a common delusion that people around that week are somehow 'losers.' ''</p>
        <p>IF this is a big week for in-towners to go out of town, it's also prime time for out-of-towners to come in. In Times Square, for example, both the Marriott Marquis and the New York Renaissance have occupancy rates ''in the high 90's,'' said Lucy Bossert, a spokeswoman for Marriott Hotels.</p>
        <p>Groups like the Grand Central Partnership, a business improvement district, promote the week as an especially good time for visitors.</p>
        <p>''We have a big tourism program planned, with visitors' carts staffed by college students that whole week for tourists in Midtown,'' said Michelle Adams, vice president of the Partnership.</p>
        <p>But all those people from somewhere else can unnerve some New Yorkers.</p>
        <p>''It's just another reminder that you are not on vacation, and you end up being a de facto tour guide,'' said Ms. Finkelstein. ''And with all those tour buses going around your neighborhood, you feel like you are on display.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Musto, who said he was still waiting to see what invitations came in for the week, also resents the vacationers. ''They went from Oshkosh to New York, and you didn't go anywhere, not even to Oshkosh,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But there could be a backlash brewing against the compulsion to flee New York during the last week in August. Ms. Orlean said it began last New Year's Eve, when many people felt pressured to have a blast.</p>
        <p>''I saw a lot of people going in the completely opposite direction, which was to say, 'I don't care, I'm happy to stay at home,' '' she said. ''And for the first time, people were liberated from feeling competitive, and it seemed anti-chic to have big plans. So maybe we've turned a collective psychological corner.''</p>
        <p>''Who knows?'' she added. ''Maybe this summer it will be different.''</p>
