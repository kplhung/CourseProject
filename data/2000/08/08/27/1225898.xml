        <p>Louisianans may practice the quirkiest politics in the nation. Among other things, candidates there are permitted to list their nicknames on the ballot, no small concession in the South, where often as not, the game is the name.</p>
        <p>Thus, Milton Vicknair, an Ascension Parish councilman, runs as Milton ''Needlenose'' Vicknair and Merlin Fleury, a sometime candidate for state representative from New Orleans, runs as Merlin ''Piece of Meat'' Fleury.</p>

        <p>Louisianans may practice the quirkiest politics in the nation. Among other things, candidates there are permitted to list their nicknames on the ballot, no small concession in the South, where often as not, the game is the name.</p>
        <p>Thus, Milton Vicknair, an Ascension Parish councilman, runs as Milton ''Needlenose'' Vicknair and Merlin Fleury, a sometime candidate for state representative from New Orleans, runs as Merlin ''Piece of Meat'' Fleury.</p>
        <p>So can Joyce Glapion, who is running to fill the New Orleans city council seat vacated when her husband, Roy, died, run as Joyce ''Mrs. Roy'' Glapion?</p>
        <p>Depends, ruled Assistant State Attorney General Andrew Benton.</p>
        <p>If she is using her husband's name to capitalize politically on it, held Mr. Benton, the answer is no. But if her husband's name is really her nickname, Mr. Benton said, then the answer is yes.</p>
        <p>So is Mrs. Glapion really known to friends and neighbors as ''Mrs. Roy?''</p>
        <p>Initially she told The New Orleans Times-Picayune that she wanted to use ''Mrs. Roy'' to communicate to voters that she was trying to carry on the work of her late husband. Then she said she wanted to use it so that she would not be confused with another Glapion on the ballot.</p>
        <p>Final answer?</p>
        <p>It's her real nickname, she said on Thursday.</p>
        <p>''I've been called that for 40 years, practically all the time,'' she insisted. ''I like it, find it a term of endearment.''</p>
        <p>Final note:</p>
        <p>There's an important precedent here. After Lindy Boggs of New Orleans succeeded her husband, Hale, in the United States House of Representative following his death in a plane crash in 1972, she sometimes ran as Lindy ''Mrs. Hale'' Boggs.</p>
