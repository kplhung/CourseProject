        <p>YOU ARE WHERE YOU LIVE  On every campus, there are dorms that develop a distinct personality: this one's for jocks, that one's nice and quiet. Now there is the Treehouse, at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pa., where toilets aren't flushed after each use and showers are limited to three minutes apiece. This election season, Trinity University in San Antonio is reserving a hall for freshmen who want to talk politics. Not one, not 2, but 14 Midwestern campuses have houses filled with former golf caddies. And at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, Inupiat House offers a menu of seal, caribou, whale blubber and moose. It's all part of a broader attempt to enhance residential life at colleges and universities nationwide. Many places are experimenting with housing students according to their majors. ''It fits part of our mission,'' said Tom Segar, assistant director of residence life at Gettysburg College in Pennsylvania. ''It's another way for them to take learning outside the classroom.''</p>
        <p>SPIN THE GLOBE  Many colleges have followed the model established by the University of California at Berkeley's International House, which was founded in 1930 and is home to 580 students -- half of them American, half from overseas. At the University of Alaska, the goal of Inupiat House is to provide a safe haven for native students who come from tiny villages ''where they're probably related to everybody,'' said Kevin L. Huddy, director of residence life. At Boston University's German House, however, Gerard Baksys said that residents rarely spoke the language. ''Technically, you're supposed to, it's B.U. policy, but no one actually pays attention to B.U. policy.''</p>

        <p>OM IS WHERE THE HEART IS  Health and wellness dorms are proliferating, largely as a response to concern over binge drinking. ''It's just students who don't want to wake up and slide through their roommate's night before,'' said Mary Cox, adviser to the Healthy Alternatives House at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts. (A resident was put on probation for coming home drunk one night.) At the Meditation and Mindfulness House at Allegheny College in western Pennsylvania, a sign out front urges, ''Please leave your shoes and your ego at the door.'' Inside, incense burns on an altar displaying residents' sacred objects, and guided meditations are a weekly event.</p>
        <p>I GAVE AT THE DORMITORY  At a number of campuses, dormitories are being set up to facilitate community service projects. As for those golf caddies, they're not just caddies, they're caddies with good grades and outstanding ''dedication and performance,'' on scholarship from the Western Golf Association. But increasingly, the main service that specialty dorms seem to provide is social -- which some people view as a step in the wrong direction. ''The main part of going to college is to expand your horizons -- academically, socially,'' said Betty Trachtenberg, dean of student affairs at Yale, where dorm assignments are random. ''If people are in theme houses according to their subject matter or already established identities or ideas, there's not much room to grow.''</p>
