        <p>ROBERT GALIONE'S lifelong passion is fighting fires. A New York City firefighter for more than 20 years, he joined the Lakeland Fire Department in 1985, serving as a volunteer firefighter and later as commissioner. On top of working nearly 50 hours a week at a Brooklyn rescue company, Mr. Galione, a 44-year-old father of three, spent 30 hours a week at the firehouse in Ronkonkoma.</p>
        <p>''I would sit down to eat dinner with my family and at least two or three times a week, the alarm would go off, and by the time I would come back, no one was at the table and my dinner was cold,'' he said. ''You have to hope people in your life understand.''</p>
        <p>In April, Mr. Galione quit the Lakeland volunteers. ''Who knew how much time was actually involved?'' he said. ''It seemed as easy as: the alarm goes off and if you're home, you answer the alarm. But there is more to it than that.''</p>
        <p>His resignation is one of many. Volunteer fire companies across the Island are experiencing a drop in membership that fire officials say has left some communities facing critical shortages.</p>
        <p>Last year there were 8,600 volunteer and professional firefighters and emergency medical technicians in Nassau's 71 departments, down 7 percent from 1994, according to William Coffin, former chairman of the Nassau County Fire Commission. The Suffolk County fire commissioner, David Fischler, estimated that the county's 109 departments have about 10,000 volunteers, down about 3 percent since 1992.</p>
        <p>Garden City, Long Beach and Ronkonkoma are the only municipalities on the Island where professional firefighters form the nucleus of an otherwise volunteer force.</p>
        <p>Worsening the effects of the shortage is the steadily increasing volume of fire calls. Nassau logged about 42,000 calls last year, a jump of 35 percent from 1994. In the same five-year period, Suffolk's calls rose nearly 20 percent.</p>
        <p>The decline in firefighters on the Island reflects a trend nationwide, where the number of volunteers, who make up 74 percent of all firefighters, is down between 5 percent and 10 percent since 1983, according to the National Volunteer Fire Council in Washington.</p>
        <p>But fire officials say some factors are especially pronounced on Long Island:</p>
        <p>*The dearth of affordable housing makes it difficult for some communities to attract the young family men who are the most likely firehouse volunteers.</p>
        <p>*The proliferation of two-income families and the lengthening and fragmentation of the workday leave more people with less time to spare and less ability to predict when that spare time will be.</p>
        <p>''If you have to pick up children at the bus or if you have two jobs, volunteering could put a strain on the family,'' said William Ryan, chief of the Lakeland Fire Department. ''You have to have your priorities. You are not getting an income from the fire house.''</p>
        <p>Many fire companies pay small stipends -- typically a few hundred dollars a month -- to older volunteers who have shown their loyalty, but they provide health or life insurance only for firefighting-related injuries. In lieu of income, the local company has traditionally provided a social function for volunteers and their families. Fire officials say many join for the free training in firefighting and emergency medical services. And volunteers talk of the adrenaline rush of responding to an emergency.</p>
        <p>But for more and more Islanders, these attractions are not enough.</p>
        <p>Robert Lincoln, chief instructor at the Nassau County Fire Service Academy, in Old Bethpage, said he detected a change in attitude among today's volunteers.</p>
        <p>''People don't commit the way they once did,'' he said. ''Years ago, when people joined the fire department, it meant that every time there was a call, they would go, and every time there was a drill, they would be there. Today, you may be a member but maybe you won't get up in the middle of the night for a call because you have to get up for work in the morning, whereas years ago, people would go to work tired.''</p>
        <p>In many communities, coverage of fire and emergency medical calls during the daytime, when many people are away at work, is the weakest link.</p>
        <p>It was around noon one weekday last summer when volunteer firefighters arrived at an Elmont home to find flames from a malfunctioning oil burner engulfing the basement. Short-staffed, the Elmont chief, George Pechacek, had to call the Valley Stream and Franklin Square companies for help and ask Floral Park to stand by.</p>
        <p>''If I had enough manpower, I probably would have had to call just one department for assistance,'' recalled Mr. Pechacek, who needed nearly 30 volunteers to put out the fire.</p>
        <p>Though the number of calls has risen in recent years, the number of serious house fires has declined because of stronger residential and commercial building codes and a growth in home security systems.</p>
        <p>The alarms are a mixed blessing. A smoking sauce pan, a power surge and even steam from a shower can trigger the sensitive systems, increasing the false-alarm rate. Such nuisance calls inspired Elmont and other fire departments to institute a procedure to initially withhold information from crews about whether a call came from a person or an automatic alarm until they are en route to the scene. The procedural change has improved the response rate, Mr. Pechacek said, noting that in Elmont, 75 percent of the alarms last year were false.</p>
        <p>Fire officials say medical rescue calls are up as well, in part due to increasing reliance on the emergency medical technicians and fire department vehicles for transport to hospitals for non-life-threatening illnesses and injuries. The aging of Long Island has also increased the workload.</p>
        <p>Last year in Nassau, 50 percent of the 120,000 medical emergencies were managed by the fire service or independent volunteer ambulance corps, according to Michael Gilroy, superintendent of the Nassau County Fire Service Academy. In Suffolk there are no police ambulances, so most medical emergencies are shouldered by volunteer ambulance corps. Last year Suffolk reported more than 100,000 medical emergencies.</p>
        <p>The shrinking pool of new applicants is not the only worry for the fire service: turnover is quicker than it was just a decade ago. Then a typical firefighter spent 10 years or more in a department. Work-family concerns now force many to quit after just three years.</p>
        <p>Steve McDonough, 40, of East Meadow was working nearly 70-hour weeks for a trucking company to pay off a home remodeling project while balancing the demands of family life and a new baby. After months of poor attendance at East Meadow Fire Department training drills and emergency calls, the three-year volunteer turned off his pager for the last time.</p>
        <p>''I'll miss answering the fire calls,'' he said wistfully. ''But I will never miss the burden of trying to keep up with the calls and the training and the fire company meetings.''</p>
        <p>Many firefighters contend that new, tougher training standards, while improving performance and safety, also increase a volunteer's time commitment.</p>
        <p>Volunteer firefighters must take 45 hours of classroom instruction covering such topics as personal protective equipment, search and rescue, and handling hoses. Practical training consists of about 10 hours of instruction in extinguishing a fire, positioning ladders and crawling through a maze blindfolded, said Thomas Kost, assistant deputy director of the Suffolk County Fire Training Academy in Yaphank.</p>
        <p>Course work must be completed within two years. On top of that, rookie firefighters must complete training at the companies in which they serve. For instance, at the East Meadow Fire Department, there is an eight-week class covering radio procedures, protective apparel, fire-scene safety and first aid, said Eric Becker, chief of the department.</p>
        <p>Fire company requirements vary but the East Meadow department mandates that each year volunteers answer 25 percent of fire calls, attend 50 percent of company drills, which run three hours every Wednesday night and Sunday morning, and come to half of the 24 department and company meetings.</p>
        <p>This adds up to 10 to 20 hours a week. Fire-station and vehicle maintenance, marching in holiday parades, fund-raising and administrative duties can add another 25 or more hours a week.</p>
        <p>Fire companies islandwide have stepped up recruitment efforts, from membership drives to open houses to career days at local high schools. Some departments have posted help-wanted signs on storefronts and street corners.</p>
        <p>Last year, Island departments joined the Fireman's Association of the State of New York to set up a hotline (1-800-FIRELINE) for callers interested in learning about volunteer opportunities. Nassau County plans to advertise the hotline in local newspapers and has worked with Suffolk on joint public service television announcements scheduled to air next month.</p>
        <p>Officials also aim to counter negative stereotypes about firefighters and the fire service. James Napolitano, chief of the East Farmingdale volunteers, said the image persists of the fire department as a men's club where women are unwelcome and where members while away the hours swilling beer. He added that some transplants from New York City, where the firefighting force is paid, presume Long Island firefighters are in the firehouse 24 hours a day.</p>
        <p>Recently the Suffolk County academy began offering basic firefighting courses for college credit applicable toward a bachelor's degree in fire science technology or an associate's degree in applied sciences through SUNY Empire State College. The Nassau Academy plans to present a similar program this fall.</p>
        <p>Recruits as young as 18 can join the fire and emergency medical services. There is no official retirement age, though many companies require volunteers over 40 to pass yearly physical examinations. While older adults are not discouraged from applying, fire officials say they are looking for young blood who will stay for the long haul.</p>
        <p>One method of attracting the younger set is through Junior Firefighters, a program, sometimes offered in conjunction with the Boy Scouts, that teaches teenagers the principles of fire science and first aid.</p>
        <p>Some fire officials envision staffing more companies by a combination of professional and volunteer firefighters, or developing alternate ways of responding to fire emergencies. Some fire companies in Suffolk, including Rocky Point, Yaphank and Ridge, already hire emergency medical technicians.</p>
        <p>But a wholesale replacement of volunteers with paid professionals would be a formidable task, Commissioner Fischler said, costing Suffolk taxpayers millions of dollars for salaries that typically run from $24,000 to $50,000 a year. ''If you talk about buildings and apparatus and salaries and benefits, there's really no way to raise those funds,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Whatever the resolution, some firefighters fear that an end to the shortage is a long way off.</p>
        <p>''My concern,'' said Walter Trapp, assistant chief in Port Washington, ''is that we are drying up on people who want to become firemen, and that no one has the answer to solve the problem now.''</p>
