        <p>Some residents and legislators in the Five Towns have very dated and romanticized views of surburbia [''Is It a House or a Synagogue?'' Aug. 20].</p>
        <p>People don't move to the suburbs to gloat about their wealth or to shed their ethnic and cultural identities, as they may have done decades ago. Orthodox Jews, and other minority and immigrant groups, move into the Five Towns to build and strengthen their communities.</p>
        <p>Legislators should consider laws in the context of such demographic changes.</p>
        <p>The parking issue in Cedarhurst is a good example of a law that needs revisiting. The $5,000 fee to waive the parking requirement imposed by the village's zoning is a farce: There is no place within walking distance of the Sephardic congregation there to build adequate parking, as the village states the money would be used to do.</p>
        <p>Another example in Cedarhurst is the matter of parking on Central Avenue. Parking is free only on Saturdays, supposedly to encourage commerce. Parking should be free both Saturday and Sunday. If revenue is an issue, then make parking metered on both days.</p>
        <p>Orthodox residents, on the other hand, should not be unkind or rude to their neighbors. Disrespectful behavior is certainly not sanctioned by Jewish law. Thus, when congregants walk to and from services on the Sabbath, they must respect the laws of the town, as well as the property of their neighbors.</p>
        <p>Cedarhurst and Lawrence residents should feel lucky to be a magnet for stable community groups. The new residents should also remember that they are participants in shaping their communities.</p>
        <p>It is unfortunate that the residents and the villages have differing views about how this is to be done.</p>
