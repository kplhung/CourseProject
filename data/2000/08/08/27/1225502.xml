        <p>WHEN a television serial about an 18th-century courtesan went off the air here two years ago, few at the struggling network that had produced the drama, called ''Xica da Silva,'' expected it to have much of an afterlife. But then 150 episodes were dubbed into Spanish and sold to a dozen other countries in Latin America, where the series quickly went on to become a ratings phenomenon everywhere it was broadcast.</p>
        <p>Now the United States, or at least the growing portion of it that watches Spanish-language television, has succumbed to the same spell. Since going on the air seven months ago, this tale of a Brazilian slave who uses her quick-wittedness and sexual prowess to gain freedom and wealth as the mistress of a powerful colonial lord has revived the fortunes of Telemundo, the country's perennial No. 2 Spanish-language network.</p>
        <p>Part of the success of ''Xica'' (pronounced SHEE-kah) undoubtedly stems from the saucy performance of Tais de Araujo, the 21-year-old actress who plays the title role and who was recently included in a list of the 25 most beautiful people in Latin America published by People magazine's Spanish-language edition. But the international popularity of ''Xica'' also demonstrates that in the genre known as the telenovela, as in soccer, nobody plays the game with more skill than Brazil.</p>
        <p>''The novela is a form of entertainment that has developed into one of the best products of Brazilian show business,'' said Joao Carlos Daniel, who, working under the stage name Daniel Filho, is one of this country's most successful directors in the genre. ''It is not an exact science and there is no sure-fire formula for guaranteed success, but without a doubt, we do it better than anyone else.''</p>
        <p>The telenovela, usually referred to simply as novela, is often described as a Latin American version of the soap opera, and while there are many similarities, there are also important differences, beginning with structure. While some American soap operas have been running for more than 40 years, a novela always has a beginning and an end, which here normally comes after about 180 episodes.</p>
        <p>Nor is the novela consigned to the ghetto of daytime programming. The United States has had prime-time soaps like ''Dallas'' and ''Dynasty,'' but in Brazil, as in the rest of Latin America, novelas are glossy entertainment on the air five or six nights a week.</p>
        <p>As such, they attract the biggest audiences, demand the highest rates of advertisers and thereby are entitled to the biggest production budgets, with the cost of making a single episode often exceeding $100,000. Indeed, novelas are so popular that nighttime broadcasts of soccer, Brazil's other great passion, are delayed until the last one is over.</p>
        <p>''My sense is that in the United States the soap opera is not a prime-time product and so less investment and effort goes into it,'' said Walter Avancini, who directed ''Xica da Silva'' and more than 20 other novelas. ''That's not the case here. The novela is the backbone of prime time, and so it has assumed a tremendous level of importance.''</p>
        <p>In the United States, Hollywood's biggest stars would view a role in a soap opera as beneath their dignity. Not so here: because even Brazil's most distinguished actors find it all but impossible to make a living just from films or theater, they are often recruited to play choice roles in novelas, performing alongside whoever the latest teenage heartthrob happens to be.</p>
        <p>''If a good script comes along, why should I refuse to participate just because it is a telenovela?'' asked Fernanda Montenegro, who was nominated for an Academy Award in 1999 for her role in ''Central Station'' and is usually cast as an elegant upper-class matron when she works in novelas. ''Why limit myself? After all, Balzac, Dumas, Dickens and Dostoyevsky all wrote serials.''</p>
        <p>The novela originated more than 50 years ago in Mexico as a radio melodrama, but when television appeared the genre was quickly adapted to the new medium and soon spread all over Latin America. Every country from Argentina to Mexico now makes novelas, but Brazil's tend to have larger casts and more elaborate plots and sets -- thus attracting the biggest audiences, even though, as in the case of ''Xica da Silva,'' they have to be dubbed from Portuguese into Spanish for the rest of Latin America and for the Spanish-language networks in the United States.</p>
        <p>''I love the Brazilian novelas more than any others because they are so beautiful to look at,'' Maria Dolores Faundez, a Venezuelan housewife, said in an interview in Caracas early this month. ''The stories are wonderful too, but everything always looks so luxurious. I especially like the way the characters dress and the magnificent apartments they live in.''</p>
        <p>Some of the popularity of Brazilian novelas may also stem from a willingness to tackle controversial social and political themes such as agrarian reform, racism, abortion, environmental degradation, homosexuality and corruption, mixed in, of course, with classic themes of jealousy, intrigue and betrayal. That tendency has in large part been implanted by scriptwriters with leftist sympathies who came to television in hopes of addressing a mass audience.</p>
        <p>''The telenovela is basically a distraction, and no one watches it in order to be educated,'' Brazil's leading author of novelas, the playwright and former Communist Party member Alfredo Dias Gomes, said in an interview shortly before his death in an automobile accident last year. ''But it is an instrument through which you can denounce and point out the errors in a society, and I have often done that and felt the public respond.''</p>
        <p>Of course, a striking boldness on sexual matters, including generous doses of nudity, has also proved to have universal appeal. ''Brazilian television is the most liberal in the world,'' said Mr. Daniel, who has worked in the medium since the 1960's. ''In terms of open sexuality, nobody in the world shows what is shown on Brazilian television. It is extremely bold, perhaps because of our Carnival tradition and the procession of nudity and raw sexuality that people have come to accept.''</p>
        <p>In a sense, the American market is the final frontier for Brazil: since 1978, more than 80 different Brazilian novelas have been exported to 119 different countries. A novela produced here, ''Isaura the Slave,'' is said to be the most popular television program ever shown in China, and Brazilian novelas today are broadcast as far afield as Indonesia, Russia, Chad, Turkey and Italy.</p>
        <p>Brazilian television executives say that period costume dramas that touch on themes of slavery or other social abuses tend to do the best abroad, and ''Xica da Silva'' certainly fits that descriptiopn. A movie version directed by Carlos Diegues had already been an international success in the 1970's, largely as a result of the perforamnce of Zeze Motta, who ended up being cast as Xica's mother in the novela.</p>
        <p>So for an unproven newcomer like Miss Araujo, who was only 17 when ''Xica da Silva'' began taping, the chance to play a figure so important in Brazilian folklore was both an unusual opportunity and a daunting challenge. ''I turned the role down at first, because I was scared and didn't think I was ready for it,'' she said in a recent interview at her home here, shortly before heading off to New York to study English. ''Xica is a legend in Brazil, and here I was, just a kid.''</p>
        <p>In addition, ''Xica da Silva'' was a conscious attempt to break down an imposing social barrier. The majority of Brazil's population may be of mixed race, but the ideal novela star, male or female, is still someone who is light-skinned, preferably with blond hair and blue or green eyes.</p>
        <p>''This was the first time that Brazilian television had a black woman as the protagonist of a novela, so we were up against some deeply ingrained prejudices,'' Mr. Avancini said. ''But Xica is one of the first symbols of feminine liberation in Brazil and has become a mythical Afro-Brazilian figure, and Tais had just the right temperament, naughty but gutsy, to win over the public.''</p>
        <p>''Xica da Silva'' was also unusual in that it was made by the Manchete network and not by Rede Globo, which is both the largest television network in Brazil and the largest privately owned commercial network outside the United States. Indeed, Globo's Projac production center on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro is a vast $125 million facility that churns out programming at a pace and on a scale that rivals a Hollywood studio.</p>
        <p>At any given moment, three of Globo's four giant soundstages are being used to tape novelas that are currently on the air, using props and sets that have been manufactured at shops on the premises. The fourth stage is usually reserved for novelas that are in the pre-production phase, comedy and variety programs or for somewhat shorter versions of novelas called ''mini-series'' that can run as many as 100 episodes, and there are also buildings on the premises set aside for editing and special effects.</p>
        <p>WHEN it comes to producing novelas, Globo functions like a Japanese factory that uses the just-in-time principle,'' said Mr. Avancini, who now works for the network. ''Normally you like to work well in advance, finishing an episode a couple of weeks before it goes on the air, but sometimes you end up taping things that are going to be broadcast in just a couple of days.''</p>
        <p>By working so close to broadcast date, Globo's novelas department gains unusual flexibility. The network makes extensive use of focus groups, whose recommendations are taken into account in expanding roles of minor characters who suddenly become popular, eliminating altogether characters that viewers do not like and even extending particularly popular novelas beyond their original length: ''Terra Nostra,'' about Italian immigrants in Sao Paulo, ran a record 233 episodes before ending early this year.</p>
        <p>The 321-acre facility, which opened in 1995, also includes outdoor areas for settings that tend to recur from one novela to the next, such as the typical Latin American town square and church or a big city at the turn of the century. When an Indian village was needed for a series that was broadcast earlier this year, Indians were even brought from the Amazon to build it.</p>
        <p>A visit one day earlier this month to Mr. Avancini's current production, a costume drama called ''The Thorn and the Rose,'' found one unit shooting on an outdoors set made up to look like a Sao Paulo street in 1927 while another was indoors on a soundstage that recreated a rustic hacienda. For the actors involved, that can mean a routine that is taxing and frantic.</p>
        <p>''Today we have 29 scenes to shoot, and I am in almost all of them,'' Eduardo Moscovis, who plays the male lead in ''The Thorn and the Rose,'' said as he hurriedly ate a plate of cold pasta during a short break. ''That's the way it is when you're right in the middle of making a novela, but you learn to get used to that rhythm, intense as it is.''</p>
        <p>Like Mr. Avancini, Ms. Araujo is now under contract to Globo, and quickly noticed the difference in atmosphere from her days at Manchete, which recently declared bankruptcy. ''With 'Xica da Silva,' we had four months of readings and rehearsals before we even began shooting, which is very unusual in Brazilian television,'' she recalled. ''Globo doesn't have time for that.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, after more than 30 years of experience and a total of 203 novelas produced in-house, the Globo formula and schedule contain few surprises. The network's evening programming begins at 6 o'clock, often with a period piece like ''The Thorn and the Rose,'' which is a Brazilianized version of ''The Taming of the Shrew'' that is set in Sao Paulo in the 1920's.</p>
        <p>Then at 7 o'clock comes a comedy, the frothier the better. The current offering, in which Miss Araujo plays a small role, is called ''Uga Uga'' and tells the Tarzan-inspired tale of a handsome young man raised in the jungle who returns to civilization, clad only in a loincloth that allows him to continually show off his muscles to a mainly female audience, in order to claim a family inheritance at the behest of the Indian tribe that has sheltered him.</p>
        <p>The most prestigious piece of prime time, or ''the noble hour,'' as it is called here, comes at 9 p.m., after the nightly news -- which is broadcast at 8 p.m., several hours later than in the United States -- and is reserved for a melodrama. At the moment, ''Lacos de Familia,'' or ''Family Ties,'' holds down the slot every evening except Sunday, and on a good night, more than half the television sets in this nation of 170 million people are tuned in.</p>
        <p>''Family Ties'' stars Vera Fischer, Brazil's leading sex symbol, as a rich and glamorous Rio widow competing with her daughter for the affections of a 25-year-old hunk. But according to the numerous gossip magazines that track every detail of every novela, the daughter will soon come down with leukemia and will need a bone marrow transplant that can only be obtained from her father, who she has been told died when she was 2 years old.</p>
        <p>''The novela is what it is,'' Mr. Daniel said. ''You can change the characters, but the stories remain basically the same, and the only novelty you are likely to see is that today's novelas are more and more technically polished. That is why I tend to agree with Peter Bogdanovich when he says that the best movies have already been made. The same is true of novelas.''</p>
        <p>Periodically, as new forms of entertainment such as the Internet and satellite television emerge, critics predict the decline or even disappearance of the genre. But Mr. Dias Gomes disagreed, saying the novela ''cannot be substituted'' because it is too deeply rooted a habit in Latin America, and Mr. Daniel agrees.</p>
        <p>''In general, the novela talks about things that are truly ours, and the people identify immediately with the characters,'' he explained. ''The novela is part of the daily routine of the Brazilian people, and there is no way to deprive them of it.''</p>
