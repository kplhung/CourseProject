        <p>WORKERS at the 15 retail stores of the Tile Shop do not receive many of the perks that many a new-economy employer may dish up to attract talent. They get no stock options, no nap rooms and certainly no on-site pet care.</p>
        <p>But the company does offer a big lure for new hires: Instead of waiting months or years to be eligible to join the 401(k) retirement savings plan, workers at Tile Shop can join as soon as they walk in the door.</p>
        <p>As job-hopping has become common in many industries, employers say that the traditional waiting periods for benefits have become an obstacle to recruiting. Qualified workers who already have benefits are loath to do without them, even temporarily, to take a new job.</p>
        <p>So more employers are reducing or eliminating the probationary periods for savings plans, vacation time, profit sharing and sometimes even medical insurance coverage, benefits experts say. And companies that have not formally changed their waiting periods are increasingly willing to waive them if a potentially valuable new employee asks.</p>
        <p>''In the current job market, this is a highly desirable thing to offer,'' said Dallas L. Salisbury, president and chief executive of the Employee Benefit Research Institute in Washington.</p>
        <p>Hard statistics are scant, but many companies say they see anecdotal evidence that  when benefits are available quickly, vacancies are filled faster and turnover among new employees is lower.</p>
        <p>The short-wait or no-wait approach seems to spreading fastest for retirement savings plans. According to surveys by the Profit-Sharing/401(k) Council of America, a nonprofit organization that includes both sponsors and providers of plans, 40 percent of companies let new employees join 401(k) plans within their first three months in 1999, up from 32 percent the previous year. And 18 percent made them eligible for profit-sharing plans that quickly, up from 12 percent.</p>
        <p>Robert A. Liberto, a vice president at Segal Advisors, the investment consulting unit of the Segal Company, a benefits consulting firm based in New York, estimated that over the last year, at least one-third of his company's clients have shortened or eliminated waiting periods for 401(k)'s.</p>
        <p>''We're seeing clients moving away from one-year eligibility to either immediate eligibility or eligibility the month following the beginning of employment,'' he said. ''Companies see it as a competitive issue. Allowing people to come into a plan immediately doesn't penalize them for coming from another job.''</p>
        <p>More than a tight labor market is at work. Federal rules governing 401(k) plans oblige employers to enroll as many middle- and low-paid workers as possible, to ensure that the plan is not deemed to unfairly favor highly paid workers, though recent rulings have eased some of the restrictions. Companies can now enroll workers automatically, and the Internet has made benefits administration easier for employers.</p>
        <p>But recruiting is the primary motive. Pearson Inc., the American arm of Pearson P.L.C., the media conglomerate based in London, eliminated its three-month wait for medical benefits in January 1999. A year later, it trimmed the wait for 401(k) plan eligibility from as long as six months to no more than 30 days, depending on the date of hiring.</p>
        <p>''We've gotten positive feedback that this has been an effective recruiting tool,'' said Randall Keller, senior vice president for human resources.</p>
        <p>At the Tile Shop chain, based in Plymouth, Minn., executives were also concerned about retention; Minnesota, after all, has an unemployment rate of just 2.5 percent. Historically, turnover in the company's sales and manufacturing divisions ran to 80 percent a year, and personnel officers found themselves having to fill the same jobs every few months. Scrapping the 90-day wait to join the 401(k) has given new workers a greater stake in staying, said Dianna Kincade, the human resources director at the company.</p>
        <p>Immediate eligibility for medical plans, however, is not yet as common, but it, too, is spreading. Kenneth R. Jacobsen, who leads the national health practice at Segal, said many more companies were shortening the wait for medical coverage from 90 days to 30. ''We're seeing this trend in mid-  to large-sized companies, and we're seeing it at a pace that is three to four times higher than a year or two ago,'' Mr. Jacobsen said.</p>
        <p>Not all waiting periods appear headed for the out box. Employee stock ownership plans, for example, still tend to have one-year eligibility requirements, because they are explicitly intended to reward longevity, said Corey Rosen, director of the National Center for Employee Ownership in Oakland, Calif.</p>
        <p>Experts caution that ''immediate eligibility'' can mean different things at different companies. Prospective employees should check the fine print to make sure that they understand a company's rules. ''It might be the first day of earnings, or it might be the first day of the first month after you start work, or even the first day of the second month,'' said David Wray, president of the Profit Sharing/401(k) Council. The variations sometimes reflect differences in how quickly companies process a new employee's paperwork, he said. Knowing when coverage will start, of course, helps job changers decide whether to extend their former  employers' medical coverage under the federal Cobra law to cover any gap.</p>
        <p>Still, whether they kick in immediately or almost immediately, accelerated benefits are making a difference. Carl Randazzo, a regional manager at the Tile Shop, said  turnover had dropped sharply at the five stores he manages since his company eliminated the waiting period for its 401(k) plan. The change, Mr. Randazzo added, is also making a big difference in hiring.</p>
        <p>''If people are looking at two job offers, this benefit can cinch it so that they go with us,'' he said.</p>
