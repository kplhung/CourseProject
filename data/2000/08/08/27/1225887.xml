        <p>Because The New York Times computer does not begin ranking teams until it has gathered at least a month's worth of data, this rating is the work of the reporter Joe Drape. The national champion will again be determined on the field -- on Jan. 3 in the Orange Bowl -- as part of the Bowl Championship Series. The series, whose primary goal is to determine the two teams that will meet in the title game, is a rating system that uses the Associated Press media poll, the ESPN/USA Today coaches' poll and eight computer rankings, including The Times's.</p>

        <p>Because The New York Times computer does not begin ranking teams until it has gathered at least a month's worth of data, this rating is the work of the reporter Joe Drape. The national champion will again be determined on the field -- on Jan. 3 in the Orange Bowl -- as part of the Bowl Championship Series. The series, whose primary goal is to determine the two teams that will meet in the title game, is a rating system that uses the Associated Press media poll, the ESPN/USA Today coaches' poll and eight computer rankings, including The Times's.</p>
        <p>1  Florida State  1999 RECORD 12-0  Why not two national titles in a row? The Seminoles return 14 starters, among them a 28-year-old quarterback, Chris Weinke, and a running back, Travis Minor, right, who will gain more than 1,000 yards behind an experienced line led by the Tarlos Thomas. The Seminoles will run more until Weinke gets comfortable with new receivers. Marvin Minnis and Anquan Boldin will keep the Florida State heritage of flashy wideouts alive. Seven starters from the best big-game defense in college football return. Linebackers Tommy Polley, Brian Allen and Bradley Jennings were the top three tacklers on the nation's 17th-ranked defense.</p>
        <p>Who can stop them? Nobody in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Bobby Bowden gets son Tommy and Clemson in Tallahassee, and he does well as the rival Florida Gators. The biggest game is early, Oct. 7, at Miami.</p>
        <p>The important question Can the freshman place-kicker Brett Cimorelli replace Sebastian Janikowski, the two-time all-American?</p>
        <p>2  Virginia Tech  1999 RECORD (11-1)  Why not a rematch with Florida State for the national title? As a redshirt freshman last year, Michael Vick led the nation in passing efficiency, was named the Big East offensive player of the year and finished third in the Heisman Trophy voting. He will be even better behind four of five returning starting linemen. His deep threat, Andre Davis, left, returns, and running back Andre Kendrick will turn the corner on the option. Coach Frank Beamer needs to replace all-American Corey Moore and eight other starters from the nation's stingiest defense, but the Hokies have had no-names playing smothering defense since beamer got there 13 years ago. He needs to replace an all-Big East punter and kicker, too.</p>
        <p>Who can stop them? Last year, Virginia Tech outscored conference opponents by 318-88. With games at Syracuse and Miami, those margins will dwindle.</p>
        <p>The important question Will the Hokies be satisfied with one dream season, or is there a foundation for a perennial power?</p>
        <p>3  Nebraska  1999 RECORD 12-1  Last year, Eric Crouch was the first Nebraska quarterback to lead the team in rushing (889 yards) since 1955. His 16 touchdowns were the most of any quarterback in the nation. With I-backs Dan Alexander, right, Correll Buckhalter and Dahrran Diedrick returning, the Cornhusker option should better last year's 266-yard rushing average. Speedy Bobby Newcombe is back at wingback - after starting the first two games at cornerback - and may rekindle the days of Johnny Rodgers. On defense, Coach Frank Solich will rely on the senior linebacker Carlos Polk (6 sacks, 21 hurries) as he replaces 6 starters, including 2 all-American defensive backs.</p>
        <p>Who can stop them? They remain the class of the Big 12 and lose recent South Division nemesis Texas from the schedule. The only tough road game is at Kansas State.</p>
        <p>The important question Will the Cornhuskers beat themselves? They fumbled 49 times last year, losing the ball 25 times.</p>
        <p>4  Wisconsin  1999 RECORD 10-2  Last year, the Badgers became the first Big Ten school to win back-to-back Rose Bowls. A third without Heisman Trophy winner Ron Dayne? Don't expect an aerial assault from Coach Barry Alvarez's team, but Wisconsin will not be as lumbering as it was with Dayne. Quarterback Brooks Bollinger completed 59.7 percent of his passes, ran for 445 yards and was named Big Ten freshman of the year. A mammoth line, led by center Casey Rabach, will make sure Michael Bennett becomes the eighth straight 1,000-yard rusher for the Badgers. The junior is the Big Ten's 100- and 200-meters champion and will whistle through those holes. Eight returning defensive starters, including the nation's best cornerback, Jamar Fletcher, allow Wisconsin to challenge once again for the best scoring defense. Last year, it was fifth.</p>
        <p>Who can stop them? Take your pick of this four-game stretch: at Michigan, Ohio State, at Michigan State, Purdue.</p>
        <p>The important question Why do Big Ten teams rarely play in the national title game? Answer: this is the nation's toughest conference, and it is hard to go undefeated.</p>
        <p>5  Texas  1999 RECORD 9-5  The Longhorns' young talent showed its inexperience late last season with losses at Texas A&amp;M, against Nebraska in the Big 12 championship game and against Arkansas in the Cotton Bowl. Not this year, especially with 18 returning starters. Either Major Applewhite (3,357 yards, 21 touchdowns) or Chris Simms, below, (son of the former Giants quarterback Phil Simms) will trigger a potent offense. Last year, Hodges Mitchell, who rushed for 1,246 yards and 9 touchdowns, will get more carries. Tackles Casey Hampton and Shaun Rogers will anchor a swift defense.</p>
        <p>Who can stop them? On Oct. 7, Texas plays a vastly improved Oklahoma in Dallas in a revival of the excitement of Red River Classics from days of yore.</p>
        <p>The important question Applewhite? Simms? Both? How will the quarterback duel affect team chemistry?</p>
        <p>6  Michigan  1999 RECORD 10-2  John Navarre will start at quarterback until Drew Henson recovers from a broken right foot. If Michigan quarterbacks can get the ball to Heisman candidate Dave Terrell (71 catches, 1,038 yards, 7 touchdowns) the Wolverines will have a balanced offensive attack. Senior running back Anthony Thomas (297 yards, 17 touchdowns) will keep opponents off balance.The defense will need to grow after losing five of its front seven. The secondary is experienced, but also gave up more passing touchdowns than eight other Big Ten teams.</p>
        <p>Who can stop them? The Wolverines go to Illinois in September, Purdue in October and Ohio State in November.</p>
        <p>The important question Was all that fuss for the past two years about Henson deserved?</p>
        <p>7  Alabama  1999 RECORD 10-3  Eighteen starters are back from a team that won the Southeastern Con- ference championship for the first time since 1992. The Tide will replace running back Shaun Alexander with senior Shaun Bohanon, but the ball will be in the hands of Freddie Milons as much as possible. Last year, he set a school record for receptions (65) and was fourth in the S.E.C. in punt returns. Alabama will play two mobile quarterbacks, Andrew Zow and Tyler Watts.</p>
        <p>Who can stop them? They open at U.C.L.A., then get pesky Southern Miss and West Division rival Ole Miss in October.</p>
        <p>The important question Can Alabama sustain the urgency that appeared in 1999 after an early loss to Louisiana Tech and a rumor that Coach Mike DuBose would lose his job?</p>
        <p>8  Miami  1999 RECORD 9-4  In Ken Dorsey, the Hurricanes have a drop-back quarterback in the image of Jim Kelly and Vinny Testaverde. As a true freshman, he passed for 807 yards and 10 touchdowns in 6 games. Dorsey's receivers may be the best in the nation -- Santana Moss (899 yards) and Reggie Wayne (40 catches). Senior James Jackson was a second-team all-Big East running back, and sophomore Clinton Portis finished fourth among league rushers. Linebacker Dan Morgan is a four-year starter and Butkus Award candidate.</p>
        <p>Who can stop them? Coach Butch Davis again has a salty non-league schedule at Washington on Sept. 9 and playing host to Florida State on Oct. 7.</p>
        <p>The important question Can the Hurricanes beat Virginia Tech for the first time since 1994?</p>
        <p>9  Kansas State  1999 RECORD 11-1  The Wildcats return 15 starters and have an exciting prospect in the junior-college transfer Josh Scobey, who is Northeastern A&amp;M's career-leading rusher with 2,423 yards and 31 touchdowns. They will beat up early on a soft schedule: Louisiana Tech, Ball State and North Texas. A pair of all-Big 12 receivers, Aaron Lockett and Quincy Morgan -- who caught 75 passes between them -- will help run up the points. Strong safety Jarrod Cooper returns to lead a secondary that may repeat as the best in the nation in pass efficiency.</p>
        <p>Who can stop them? Maybe October -- the Wildcats travel to Colorado and Texas A&amp;M with a home game against Oklahoma in between.</p>
        <p>The important question Will K-State ever play in a national title game?</p>
        <p>10  Washington  1999 RECORD 7-5  After opening the 1999 season 0-2, the Huskies got rolling behind quarterback Marques Tuiasosopo, below, who set a school record by passing and running for 2,762 yards. The line returns four starters, including the senior guard Chad Ward. Coach Rick Neuheisel must rebuild a defensive unit that gave up more than 400 yards a game last season.</p>
        <p>Who can stop them? The Huskies play host to Miami and travel to Colorado in weeks two and three.</p>
        <p>The important question Can the defense quit giving away the edge that Tuiasosopo and the offense gain?</p>
        <p>11  Mississippi  1999 RECORD 8-4  The Rebels may have the best backfield in the nation with senior quarterback Romaro Miller, the S.E.C.'s leader in all-purpose yards last year; running back Deuce McAllister and the hard running Joe Gunn. The nucleus of a line that allowed only 19 sacks last year will make Ole Miss awfully tough, especially in the seven games they play at home.</p>
        <p>Who can stop them? They travel to Alabama and Georgia.</p>
        <p>The important question Can Ole Miss really rise to the top of the nation's second-toughest conference?</p>
        <p>12  Florida  1999 RECORD 9-4  Nine starters are back on defense, including end Alex Brown, who had a school-record 13 sacks last year. But the offense needs major retooling after finishing 65th in rushing --Earnest Graham returns after missing four games in 1999 with a thigh injury -- and losing wide receivers Darrell Jackson and Travis Taylor to the N.F.L. Coach Steve Spurrier has put the pressure on quarterback Jesse Palmer to lead a team that finished last season with three straight losses.</p>
        <p>Who can stop them? Maybe Tennessee early and Florida State in the season-finale.</p>
        <p>The important question Can Spurrier restore the Gators' intensity?</p>
        <p>13  Tennessee  1999 RECORD 9-3  Senior running back Travis Henry (6.3-yard average) will be the focal point until either sophomore Joey Mathews or freshman Casey Clausen can replace Tee Martin at quarterback. Defensive end Will Overstreet and linebacker Eric Westmoreland are swift and emotional leaders of a rebuilding defense. The Vols had nine players taken in the April N.F.L. draft.</p>
        <p>Who can stop them? They Vols open with tough Southern Miss and Florida, though both games are at home, as is the Alabama game.</p>
        <p>The important question Is this another underrated squad in the mold of the 1998 Vols, who won the national title?</p>
        <p>14  Illinois  1999 RECORD 8-4</p>
        <p>This is a breakout year for the Illini behind 10 returning offensive starters, who will be led by quarterback Kurt Kittner. He threw for 2,448 yards and 22 touchdowns to 11 different receivers as Illinois scored the most points in school history. His line returns, so inside runner Rocky Harvey will help control the clock. Only four starters, however, return on a defense that gave up an average of 388.5 yards.</p>
        <p>Who can stop them? Toughest road games are back-to-back in October: Penn State and Michigan State.</p>
        <p>The important question Can Coach Ron Turner put together a defense as solid as the offense is explosive?</p>
        <p>15  Boise State  1999 RECORD 10-3  The Broncos will be this season's Marshall with a Chad Pennington-style quarterback in Bart Hendricks, who last year threw for 3,103 yards and 22 touchdowns and was the Big West offensive player of the year. He will work with eight experienced receivers, including N.F.L. prospect Jeb Putzier, who is 6-5 and runs a 4.5 40-yard dash. The senior cornerback Dempsy Dees is one of the best cover players in the nation.</p>
        <p>Who can stop them? The Broncos travel to Arkansas and Washington State.</p>
        <p>The important question How long does it take for the Broncos to crack the national polls?</p>
        <p>16  Georgia  1999 RECORD 8-4  The Bulldogs return 19 starters and an athletic quarterback, Quincy Carter, right, from a team that led the S.E.C. in total offense with an average of 416 yards in 1999. Running back Jasper Sanks rumbled for 896 yards, but had trouble hanging on to the ball. The defense was not as impressive; it gave up 382 yards a game, the most in the conference.</p>
        <p>Who can stop them? They get Tennessee, Florida and Ole Miss at home.</p>
        <p>The important question Can the new defensive coordinator Gary Gibbs put some desire in a suspect defense?</p>
        <p>17  Clemson  1999 RECORD 6-6  Linebacker Keith Adams, below, who recorded 186 tackles in 1999, is one of eight starters returning on a defense that limited Florida State to 17 points. Bobby Bowden's son Tommy is in his second year and will direct a hurry-up offense that will keep opposing defenses running. Wide receiver Rod Gardner, who caught at least 5 passes in 11 of 12 games, leads a fleet versatile receiving corps.</p>
        <p>Who can stop them? The Tigers' weak schedule could carry them to into Tallahassee at 9-0 for the father-son matchup against the Seminoles.</p>
        <p>The important question In Bowden's second year at Tulane, the Green Wave went undefeated; will history repeat itself?</p>
        <p>18  Oklahoma  1999 RECORD 7-5  Coach Bob Stoops took the Sooners to the air -- quickly. Last year, quarterback Josh Heupel threw for 3,460 yards and 30 touchdowns to lead an offense that needed only an average of 2 minutes 21 seconds to score. Now, Stoops turns his attention to a defense that gave up the most rushing yards in the Big 12. The Sooners' front seven returns.</p>
        <p>Who can stop them? Oklahoma will have to overcome rivals Texas and Nebraska.</p>
        <p>The important question Can the Sooners put some starch into a defense that gave up big leads in losses to Notre Dame and Texas?</p>
        <p>19  Purdue  1999 RECORD 7-5  If the Boilermakers are to make an appearance in the Rose Bowl for the first time since 1966, quarterback Drew Brees is going to need help. He threw for 3,909 yards and 25 touchdowns last season but will miss Chris Daniels, the departed primary receiver who made 121 catches. The defense especially has to pitch in after giving up more than 28 points a game in conference play.</p>
        <p>Who can stop them? Take your pick from a brutal schedule: at Notre Dame, Penn State or Wisconsin. Home games against Michigan and Ohio State.</p>
        <p>The important question Can Coach Joe Tiller turn the explosive Boilermakers into contenders as well as entertainers?</p>
        <p>20  Penn State  1999 RECORD 10-3  Three defensive all-Americans departed for the N.F.L. -- Courtney Brown, LaVar Arrington and Brandon Short -- leaving only one player who started more than seven games, end Justin Kurpeikis. Quarterback Rashard Casey led the Big Ten in passing efficiency despite alternating with Kevin Thompson, but faces an aggravated assault charge that could become a distraction. Coach Joe Paterno believes Casey will be exonerated.</p>
        <p>Who can stop them?The Big Ten schedule.</p>
        <p>The important question Will Paterno get the seven victories he needs to pass Bear Bryant as the Division I-A career leader in victories this year, or next year?</p>
