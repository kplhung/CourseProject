        <p>JUST over 50 years after his death in London, events around the world are reaffirming the apparently boundless fascination with the dancer and choreographer Vaslav Nijinsky, whose brief career ended at 29 because of the mental illness that gripped him the rest of his 61 years.</p>
        <p>In March, a comprehensive Nijinsky exhibition, including his own drawings and paintings, began touring European museums. Nijinsky-themed plays ran this past winter and spring in Tokyo, London and Scottsdale, Ariz., and in May the Royal Ballet performed ''L'Apres-Midi d'un Faune,'' his 1912 debut as a choreographer, and a controversial re-creation of his 1913 ''Jeux.'' The Nijinsky season continued on July 2 when the Hamburg Ballet gave the premiere of John Neumeier's homage, ''Nijinsky.''</p>
        <p>The mental illness that culminated in a breakdown in 1919 froze Nijinsky's image in perpetually radiant youth, an early-20th-century Jim Morrison or Bruce Lee. A virtuoso of unprecedented caliber, an unabashedly erotic interpreter of gender-bending roles, a choreographer of revolutionary ballets, a scandalously open bisexual, a self-styled ''philosopher of feeling,'' a madman -- Nijinsky left a rich yet enigmatic legacy that still eludes full understanding.</p>
        <p>Nijinsky created his own system of dance notation, which was finally deciphered in 1984, but he recorded the steps only for ''Faune.'' Before being dropped from the Diaghilev Ballets Russes repertory, ''Jeux'' and ''Le Sacre du Printemps'' (1913) received fewer than 10 performances each in Paris and London, and ''Till Eulenspiegel'' (1916) received just 23 during the 1916-17 United States tour. Despite numerous imaginative reinterpretations over the decades, these last three ballets were long presumed lost, leaving scant evidence for assessing Nijinsky's choreography, which was largely dismissed until books by Lincoln Kirstein and Richard Buckle in the 1970's gave it an elevated and, according to some, inflated stature.</p>
        <p>But in 1971, Millicent Hodson, an American student who wanted the exercise of choreographing ''in the style of'' Nijinsky, began efforts to reconstruct ''Le Sacre.'' Ten years later she met and married the British art historian Kenneth Archer, an  authority on the Russian painter and pantheistic philosopher Nicholas Roerich, whose original costumes and set designs for ''Le Sacre'' he subsequently recreated. Seven companies have produced the Hodson-Archer reconstruction of ''Le Sacre,'' starting with the Joffrey Ballet in 1987.</p>
        <p>In 1994, Ms. Hodson and Mr. Archer mounted their first (and so far only) reconstruction of ''Till Eulenspiegel'' with the Paris Opera Ballet, and in 1996 they presented a ''reconstruction after'' Nijinsky's ''Jeux'' with the Opera Ballet of Verona in Italy. But their efforts had never been seen in England before the Royal Ballet's staging in May of ''Jeux,'' alongside ''Faune,'' Bronislava Nijinska's 1924 ''Les Biches'' and Michel Fokine's 1910 ''Firebird.''</p>
        <p>Coinciding with this ''Diaghilev Legacy'' program, a reworking of David Pownall's play ''Nijinsky: Death of a Faun'' was presented at the Royal Opera House's Linbury Studio Theater. It starred the dancer Nicholas Johnson, who commissioned the one-man drama and was its original interpreter in 1991 and previously performed many of Nijinsky's roles with the Royal and English National Ballets. He also danced Nijinsky's ''soul'' in the 1975 BBC Omnibus documentary ''God of the Dance.''</p>
        <p>Nijinsky's journal, a quasi-mystical and undeniably disturbed document written on the eve of his 1919 breakdown, said that ''Jeux'' was a veiled portrayal of Diaghilev's fantasy of a gay threesome. But a nocturnal tennis match at Lady Ottoline Morrell's London home in July 1912 also purportedly inspired the ''poeme-danse,'' the first ballet to treat contemporary life and bisexuality and to resolve a love triangle as a menage a trois. His imagistic scenario of a three-way courtship, drawing on Bloomsbury's libertine manners and mores, also marked the first time a choreographer had commissioned a score; Claude Debussy's 18-minute masterpiece was only recognized as such decades later.</p>
        <p>In ''Jeux,'' a lost ball draws a man and two women from an offstage tennis court into a secluded garden, where shifting games of jealousy and desire are played out in ambiguous couplings and triplings. The figures were possibly based on the painter Duncan Grant and the Stephens sisters, the novelist Virginia Woolf and the painter Vanessa Bell, who would later vie for Grant's attentions. Another source may have been Nijinsky's three-way tennis games in 1908 with his sister, Bronislava, and his early lover, Prince Lvov.</p>
        <p>Contemporary reviews did not disparage Nijinsky's morals, but attacked instead his cinematically abrupt choreography with its pioneering neoclassical juxtapositions of sportive movement, Edwardian walks, conversational gestures, mothlike arm flapping and period social dances like the waltz, tango and turkey trot. In the end, the riotous scandal of ''Le Sacre,'' whose hotly anticipated premiere followed two weeks later, overshadowed the more subtle and sophisticated ''Jeux,'' which was later labeled Nijinsky's most modest work.</p>
        <p>Eighty-seven years after the fact, how much credence should we give a ballet reassembled from fragmentary evidence? Like other arts, choreography is exactingly detailed and precise, but the methods of recording and reconstructing it remain controversial and poorly understood. Critical assessments of the Nijinsky restorations, typically focusing on the choreographic more than the design aspects, often trip on these issues.</p>
        <p>This was certainly the case with the reviews in Britain, which, unlike the more positive 1996 Verona notices, underplayed the psychological incision and striking modernity of the revived ''Jeux'' in favor of superficial dismissals of its viability or desirability. But some observers appreciate the Hodson-Archer reconstructions as impressionistic interpretations, despite questioning their authenticity; Judith Mackrell of The Guardian and Jann Parry of The Observer were among those who applauded a ''Jeux'' that may be only partly genuine.</p>
        <p>''Frankly, I don't care if it wasn't 100 percent Nijinsky,'' said the Royal Ballet soloist and choreographer William Tuckett, who set his own second ballet to Debussy's ''Jeux.''  ''This was not a dryly intellectual or self-aggrandizing exercise. The reconstructors were dedicated and meticulous in their research and analysis but used feeling and intuition, too. They created something genuine and valid in the spirit of the original. It was completely fresh and stood absolutely in its own right, defying historical categorization.''</p>
        <p>USING all available evidence -- in this case period photographs; drawings by Leon Bakst, who designed the sets, and contemporary artists; the Debussy piano score with Nijinsky's libretto notes; accounts in the news media and memoirs, and conversations with relatives and proteges of original participants -- the two ''ballet archaeologists'' fix steps and positions to musical passages where they can. To bridge gaps in the trail of evidence, Ms. Hodson uses the logic of dance technique, her scholar's knowledge of the choreographer's stylistic proclivities, exhaustive experimentation and old-fashioned intuition.</p>
        <p>She carefully calls this process intervention as opposed to invention, while stressing the need to breathe living stage appeal into what might otherwise be museum pieces. The drawings she makes (she is also a visual artist) to aid the reconstruction process have been widely published and exhibited, most recently in May at Gallery K in London. Ms. Hodson and Mr. Archer also assemble dossiers of reading and visual materials to help the creative team -- for ''Jeux,'' the Royal Ballet principals Bruce Sansom and Deborah Bull and the soloist Gillian Revie -- soak up the social and cultural atmosphere of the time.</p>
        <p>Nijinsky's time is on display in the exhibition ''Nijinsky: Legend and Modernist,'' which is intended to demythologize him and clarify his career. It is a collaboration between the Dansmuseet in Stockholm, where it was on view this spring, and the Musee d'Orsay in Paris, where it will be shown from Oct. 23 to Feb. 18. Two Nijinsky documentaries will have their premieres during the Paris show.</p>
        <p>Nijinsky inspired more artistic interpretations than any other dancer, and the exhibition showcases examples of these from public and private collections, along with memorabilia and previously unknown works. Also on display are many of Nijinsky's haunting, circle-based drawings and paintings, made by the hundreds between 1916 and 1919 and resembling nonobjective Russian art of the same period. The catalog essays, and the exhibition as a whole, argue that Nijinsky's enigmatic diary and visual works, previously dismissed as pathological, should be regarded as important continuations of his modernist creativity once circumstances separated him from the stage.</p>
        <p>Mr. Neumeier, the artistic director of the Hamburg Ballet, has had a longtime enchantment with Nijinsky. He began gathering the memorabilia collection that forms the centerpiece of ''Nijinsky: Legend and Modernist'' in 1975. A version of the exhibit opened at Hamburg's Museum fur Kunst und Gewerbe on July 2, the same day the Hamburg Ballet presented the premiere of Mr. Neumeier's ''Nijinsky.'' The homage begins with Nijinsky's last performance, set on a meticulous re-creation of the actual recital hall, which was recently torn out of the Suvretta Hotel in St. Moritz, Switzerland. Characters from the dancer's life on and off the stage then interact in a free-association of time, space and identity comparable in form to his diary.</p>
        <p>Mr. Neumeier presents a Nijinsky gala every year, and the 25th was given on July 16 with the Royal Ballet's ''Jeux'' cast as invited performers. The Hamburg run of the Nijinsky exhibition ends today.</p>
        <p>Two new plays and two forthcoming films signal that the fascination with Nijinsky will not subside anytime soon. In February, William Luce's ''Nijinsky,'' featuring leading Japanese actors and the Tokyo Ballet principal Yasuyuki Shuto, had a critically acclaimed, sold-out three-week run at the Parco Theater in Tokyo, where it will return next year. An English translation and European productions are planned for the play, which has choreography by Gary Chryst.</p>
        <p>In mid-June at Arizona State University's Kerr Cultural Center in Scottsdale, Kinga Nijinsky-Gaspers played her grandmother Romola in Terry Earp's ''Madame Nijinsky -- Married to a God.'' Ms. Earp, the wife of Wyatt Earp's great-grandnephew, based the one-woman play on family recollections and Romola Nijinsky's books and letters. It runs in Phoenix through Sept. 9.</p>
        <p>In film, the Australian director Paul Cox (''Vincent'') has in production an abstract, 85-minute homage to Nijinsky featuring Sir Derek Jacobi narrating pasages from the dancer's diary. The American screenwriter Eva Burch's independent film, tentatively titled ''Nijinsky's War,'' is scheduled to begin production next year.</p>
        <p>For all the ferment, the direct record of Nijinsky's artistry consists solely of black-and-white photographs, made with leading photographers and aglow with an otherworldly quality. No film of him performing is known to exist, but an intriguing concurrence of anecdote, rumor and circumstance suggests that footage may someday be found. Perhaps only then can Nijinsky's overpowering myth be grounded in reality.</p>
