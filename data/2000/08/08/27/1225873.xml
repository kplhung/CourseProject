        <p>Mike Piazza got barreled over at the plate so forcefully in the fourth inning last night that he stayed in the dirt for a few extra seconds, like a quarterback who had been leveled by Warren Sapp. When Piazza finally managed to stand up, he squinted, he grimaced and he shook his head back and forth, trying to bring himself back to life.</p>
        <p>Piazza was in his squatting position about two minutes later, and he was back terrorizing the Arizona Diamondbacks soon after. In the sixth inning, Piazza drilled a fastball from the starter Brian Anderson that seemed like a waste pitch into the left-field bleachers. The Mets were thrilled, and the fans at Shea Stadium were rowdy.</p>

        <p>Mike Piazza got barreled over at the plate so forcefully in the fourth inning last night that he stayed in the dirt for a few extra seconds, like a quarterback who had been leveled by Warren Sapp. When Piazza finally managed to stand up, he squinted, he grimaced and he shook his head back and forth, trying to bring himself back to life.</p>
        <p>Piazza was in his squatting position about two minutes later, and he was back terrorizing the Arizona Diamondbacks soon after. In the sixth inning, Piazza drilled a fastball from the starter Brian Anderson that seemed like a waste pitch into the left-field bleachers. The Mets were thrilled, and the fans at Shea Stadium were rowdy.</p>
        <p>There were more ''M.V.P.!'' chants for Piazza and more thoughts of the postseason.</p>
        <p>Still, the excitement did not last all night. It did not even stretch for one more inning. The Diamondbacks evened the score in the seventh against Bobby J. Jones and they seized control in the 10th when they battered Rick White with hits that seemed like lasers, scoring four runs and rolling to a 5-1 victory on a warm and frustrating evening for the Mets.</p>
        <p>''It was a game that was going to be played until one team got on a guy,'' White said. ''I was the guy they got all over.''</p>
        <p>So there was no chance for Piazza to be the hero on a night where he got buried, and then buried Anderson and waited for someone to help him. No one did; the Mets went 0 for 9 with runners in scoring position. It was a disappointing game for the Mets because the Atlanta Braves fell to the St. Louis Cardinals, 6-3. Once again, the Mets failed to gain on the first-place Braves in the National League East and still trail by two games. In addition, Arizona is now back to four and a half games behind the Mets for the wild-card berth.</p>
        <p>''It was a frustrating loss,'' said Piazza, whose face was puffy and who had a bruise on his left eyelid. ''No question.''</p>
        <p>White replaced Armando Benitez in the 10th, and he was more ineffective than he had been at any time since the Mets obtained him last month from Tampa Bay. Jay Bell hit a fat 1-2 fastball for a one-out double and Luis Gonzalez followed with a double over Jay Payton's head in center field to make it 2-1. Greg Colbrunn ripped a two-run double, and Damian Miller added a run-scoring single. White had allowed two earned runs in his first 17 1/3 innings as a Met, but the Diamondbacks stung him for twice as many before the reliever could notch three outs.</p>
        <p>''After that first out,'' White said, ''I don't know what happened.''</p>
        <p>One night after Randy Johnson inexplicably blemished the pitcher's mound with his terrible performance, Jones and Anderson provided the sort of outings that Johnson has made routine against everyone but the Mets. Both starters were dominant for the first five innings.</p>
        <p>But Piazza changed that with one amazing swing. Anderson was ahead with a 1-2 count when he fired an 87-mile-an-hour fastball that was up around Piazza's eyes. Piazza somehow reached up and drilled the high outside pitch 413 feet. How did he even hit the pitch? Anderson surely asked that question.</p>
        <p>How did I surrender the 1-0 lead? That is the question Jones could have asked himself in the seventh. Miller hit a two-out double and scored on David Dellucci's pinch-hit single, as Manager Bobby Valentine did not opt for a left-hander like Dennis Cook or John Franco. Jones allowed one earned run and seven hits in seven innings, and Anderson gave up one earned run and four hits in six.</p>
        <p>After Bell was credited with a gift-wrapped triple in the fourth when Payton bobbled his double on the warning track, Gonzalez poked a fly ball to medium center. Payton got himself in perfect position and fired a one-bouncer to the plate. The throw reached Piazza, whose left leg and most of his body was blocking the plate, an instant before Bell. Naturally, there was a collision.</p>
        <p>Bell lifted his right forearm and rammed into Piazza's neck, sending the 215-pound Piazza flying and then tumbling down with him. Piazza crumbled to the dirt and bit his lip, but he was coherent enough to show Umpire Alfonso Marquez the ball. Once it was clear that Piazza had held on to it, the fans gave him a standing ovation and chanted ''M.V.P.! M.V.P.!'' Piazza, who has already had two concussions this season, seemed dazed, but he was back to work immediately.</p>
        <p>''It hurts a lot more when he's safe,'' Piazza said.</p>
        <p>While the 185-pound Bell said it did not ''hurt him as much as it hurt me'' because Piazza weighs more, Piazza was not thrilled with Bell's high hit.</p>
        <p>''I thought his forearms were a little high, but I'm not going to complain about it,'' Piazza said. ''I'm not going to cry. It's one of those things.''</p>
        <p>When a reporter mentioned that Bell was arguably going after Piazza's head with more conviction than Roger Clemens, who threw a pitch that drilled Piazza's helmet on July 9, Piazza did not disagree. Piazza looked down at his feet before smiling nervously and admitting, ''You make a good point.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>ROBIN VENTURA, who has 14 career grand slams and is a .351 hitter with the bases loaded, rapped into a double play with the bases loaded in the fourth and left another runner in scoring position. . . . BENNY AGBAYANI flied out in his first at-bat to end a streak of reaching base safely in 10 straight plate appearances. . . . DEREK BELL went 0 for 4 and is 5 for his last 58. . . . Manager BOBBY VALENTINE celebrated his four-year anniversary as manager of the Mets yesterday. He has a 361-286 record.</p>
