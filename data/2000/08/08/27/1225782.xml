        <p>Dr M Lee Pearce solicits proxies in attempt to gain seats on board of directors of Tenet Healthcare Corp (S)</p>

        <p>M. Lee Pearce has struck again. Last week turned out to be far from the first time that Mr. Pearce, 69, a physician, lawyer and investor in Pompano Beach, Fla., has been a potentially costly annoyance to the Tenet Healthcare Corporation and its predecessor hospital chains. In government filings, Dr. Pearce accused Tenet of lackluster results and said he would solicit proxies to seek four seats on the board. Jeffrey Barbakow, Tenet's chief executive, is among the directors seeking re-election.</p>
        <p>Dr. Pearce's stake in Tenet, worth about $7.5 million, dates to 1985, when he sold two hospitals to American Medical International. The chain's largest shareholder, he tried unsuccessfully to buy it in 1989. He accused the new owners of fraud and collected $16 million in a 1991 settlement. Tenet, then known as National Medical Enterprises, bought American Medical in 1994.</p>

        <p>M. Lee Pearce has struck again. Last week turned out to be far from the first time that Mr. Pearce, 69, a physician, lawyer and investor in Pompano Beach, Fla., has been a potentially costly annoyance to the Tenet Healthcare Corporation and its predecessor hospital chains. In government filings, Dr. Pearce accused Tenet of lackluster results and said he would solicit proxies to seek four seats on the board. Jeffrey Barbakow, Tenet's chief executive, is among the directors seeking re-election.</p>
        <p>Dr. Pearce's stake in Tenet, worth about $7.5 million, dates to 1985, when he sold two hospitals to American Medical International. The chain's largest shareholder, he tried unsuccessfully to buy it in 1989. He accused the new owners of fraud and collected $16 million in a 1991 settlement. Tenet, then known as National Medical Enterprises, bought American Medical in 1994.</p>
        <p>Tenet was eager to publicize his record, saying that in past proxy contests and litigation he ''extracted a premium on the sale of his shares that was not available to other shareholders.''</p>
        <p>Jeff Villwock, a Pearce adviser based in Atlanta, returned fire, saying, ''He is not in this for the greenmail.'' But Peter A. Emch, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, said that considering Tenet's recentimprovements in both performance and stock price, Dr. Pearce's timing seemed a bit odd.</p>
