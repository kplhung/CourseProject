        <p>GOLD is the traditional symbol of 50th anniversaries, but when the world's best-known car show celebrates a half century, chrome wire wheels and $25,000 leather interiors seem more apt.</p>
        <p>Founded in 1950, the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance is held annually at the Lodge at Pebble Beach.</p>
        <p>It is regarded as the definitive event on the car show circuit.</p>
        <p>David Brownell of Manchester Center, Vt., who was a judge of the American and European boattail design class, and who has served as a judge at various shows throughout the world for more than 20 years, said: ''The standards at Pebble are the highest, and the cars are the best. This is the Super Bowl of vintage car concours competition.''</p>
        <p>On Aug. 20, owners entered 186 cars in 28 classes. The best of show trophy went to a 1937 Delahaye 135M Figoni et Falaschi Cabriolet owned by Jacques and Betty Harguindeguy of Walnut Creek, Calif. ''The car had been taken apart in the late 50's and sat since then in a garage, outside Prague,'' said Mr. Harguindeguy. ''I bought it 3 1/2 years ago, had it restored, and the world saw it for the first time in 50 years at Pebble.'' The concours featured two special classes that celebrated its history. One class featured best-of-show winners from past shows, including a 1938 Bugatti Type 57SC Atlantic owned by the clothing designer Ralph Lauren. The other featured cars that were driven in races held on public roads on the Monterey peninsula in the 1950's.</p>
        <p>Admission was doubled this year to $100 from $50, but the number of spectators remained about the same, at 15,000, show officials said.</p>
