        <p>WITH unanimity and astonishing speed -- 16 minutes elapsed from introduction to passage in the House of Representatives -- Congress has acted to exempt religious institutions from land-use rules that excessively burden religious exercise.</p>
        <p>President Clinton is expected to sign the bill next month, said Jake Siewert, a White House spokesman.</p>
        <p>With that, some of the most vexatious issues in land-use regulation will be open for new debate: Do zoning and landmarks laws pose special hardships for religious institutions? Are land-use objections sometimes raised by opponents whose true motive is bigotry? Do communities have the right to ask religious institutions to abide by the same land-use rules that apply to everyone else?</p>
        <p>Such questions typically come to the fore when a congregation seeks either to tear down or alter a designated landmark, as St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church on Park Avenue did in 1984, or to build a new structure that requires a zoning variance or other land-use review.</p>
        <p>For example, strong opposition has met a plan by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to build a temple in Harrison, N.Y., on a 24-acre site at Westchester Avenue and Kenilworth Road where zoning imposes a 30-foot height limit. The main body of the temple would be almost 45 feet high, not counting a tower and cupola.</p>
        <p>''Everybody needs to conform to the same rules, which are there to protect the community,'' said Kathy Gurfein, who lives across the street. That, she said, means a 30-foot height limit. Period.</p>
        <p>Her words are echoed in New Rochelle, N.Y., by Edward D. Ryan, who lives next door to a 0.8-acre site at 1149 North Avenue where Young Israel of New Rochelle, an Orthodox congregation, plans to build a new synagogue. ''If they do it in accordance with current land-use laws, there's absolutely no objection,'' Mr. Ryan said.</p>
        <p>But the congregation is seeking variances because it needs more than zoning allows: a synagogue, social hall and study hall with 36,885 square feet, almost three times the floor area permitted on the site. It would also be more than eight feet higher. There would only be three parking spaces on site, compared with the requirement for 122. (Two nearby parking lots would be used instead.)</p>
        <p>Opponents look at the social hall and see a prospective catering facility that would generate heavy traffic and commercialize their neighborhood, despite Young Israel's assurances that it would do no such thing.</p>
        <p>For its part, the congregation cannot conceive of a synagogue without space to accommodate sit-down meals after Sabbath services, circumcision ceremonies, receptions following bar mitzvahs and bat mitzvahs and the overflow crowd of worshippers during holidays.</p>
        <p>''It's like saying you can have the building provided it doesn't meet your requirements,'' said Meyer G. Koplow, the former president of Young Israel. The congregation has faced one land-use issue after another, the latest being the requirement for an exhaustive environmental impact statement since the site abuts wetlands.</p>
        <p>''We seem to be in a high-hurdles race,'' said Michael Turek, who is in charge of community relations for Young Israel. ''As we run down the lane, the hurdles get higher. And the finish line is but a transient dream.''</p>
        <p>The new legislation would not necessarily eliminate the hurdles, its supporters say, but would compel the government to make a good case for raising them.</p>
        <p>Among the bipartisan co-sponsors was Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, the Democratic vice presidential candidate. The bill was endorsed by religious leaders, civil libertarians and property-rights advocates.</p>
        <p>But the bill alarmed planners, preservationists and local officials, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York most prominent among them. He warned New York's senators on July 25 that the bill would allow religious institutions ''to exempt themselves from reasonable local regulation, potentially allowing them to ignore density, height and setback, parking and other zoning requirements, as well as historic preservation statutes.''</p>
        <p>''There is no clear justification for federal intervention in the administration of our system of land-use regulation,'' Mayor Giuliani wrote. ''Facilities built and developed by religious institutions can produce the same kind of noise, traffic, visual and other impacts common to other uses which affect the quality of life.''</p>
        <p>More bluntly, Kent L. Barwick, the president of the Municipal Art Society and former chairman of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, said the bill is a ''hunting license to tear down landmarks, circumvent zoning and thwart established environmental standards.''</p>
        <p>Working with preservationists, New York's Democratic senators, Charles E. Schumer and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, managed at the last moment to specify in the legislative history of the bill that it ''does not provide religious institutions with immunity from land-use regulation.''</p>
        <p>Tony Bullock, the chief of staff to Mr. Moynihan, one of the most preservation-minded senators, said concerns about the bill ''may be somewhat overstated.'' And he speaks as a former local official, having been town supervisor of East Hampton, N.Y., for eight years. ''Most zoning regulations will continue as they have,'' Mr. Bullock said, ''but if someone feels they've been discriminated against, they have some basis for bringing a federal action.''</p>
        <p>Specifically, the bill prohibits governments from imposing land-use regulations that create a ''substantial burden'' on religious exercise -- whether or not that exercise is ''compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief'' -- unless such rules are the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling governmental interest.</p>
        <p>''At the core of religious freedom is the ability for assemblies to gather and worship together,'' said Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, on introducing the bill July 13. ''Finding a location to do so, however, can be quite difficult when faced with pervasive land-use regulations.''</p>
        <p>His bill, the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, also covers those confined to jails and hospitals, based on testimony that prisoners had been denied matzo at Passover, for example, or were prevented from taking communion.</p>
        <p>THIS is not the first time Congress has grappled with the issue. In 1993, it passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which also prohibited government from substantially burdening religious exercise.</p>
        <p>That year, St. Peter Roman Catholic Church of Boerne, Tex., in the Archdiocese of San Antonio, applied for permission to expand its Mission Revival sanctuary, which is in a historic district.</p>
        <p>The application was turned down by the Landmark Commission and City Council of Boerne (BER-nie). Archbishop Patrick F. Flores sued, citing the religious freedom act. In response, Boerne claimed that the act itself was unconstitutional.</p>
        <p>The United States Supreme Court agreed, ruling in 1997 that Congress had exceeded its authority in passing the legislation.</p>
        <p>The first effort to draft a measure that would overcome the constitutional objections was the Religious Liberty Protection Act, at which some civil-rights groups balked. The more narrowly focused Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act passed the Senate by unanimous consent on July 27. At 6:08 p.m. that day, it was received in the House. At 6:24 p.m., it was passed without objection.</p>
        <p>Critical of the bill's ''midnight passage,'' Mr. Barwick of the Municipal Art Society said, ''There has been a thundering silence which, in the end, will inevitably be broken by the toppling of 18th-century steeples.''</p>
        <p>Actually, the silence is more likely to be broken by the sound of gavels, when the first claims are made under the law and the first constitutional challenges follow.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the law may have a pre-emptive effect, said Richard Moe, president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. In a letter to the Senate, he said it would ''place tremendous pressure on local municipalities to minimize the risk of litigation by simply approving construction or demolition plans by religious institutions -- regardless of whether those plans are compatible with local land-use laws -- or by exempting churches from local zoning and landmarking altogether.''</p>
        <p>It is too early to say whether the bill, once signed by the president, would be invoked in New Rochelle or Harrison because neither government has given its final answer. On Sept. 7, the Zoning Board of Appeals in Harrison is to consider the variances sought for the Mormon temple.</p>
        <p>Given the volatile nature of the case, a spokesman in Salt Lake City said that church officials could not comment on the Harrison temple project at this time. (The rendering reproduced on page 1 came from an application filed by the church and was furnished by the opponents.)</p>
        <p>Even the basic measurements of the proposed temple are a source of contention. In its application, the church is seeking permission to build a 44.7-foot structure in a 30-foot zone. And zoning rules customarily except belfries, cupolas, domes and steeples from height calculations.</p>
        <p>But neighborhood opponents question how much of the 106-foot tower, which would be topped by a statue of the angel Moroni, is cupola and how much is usable building space. They also note that because the temple would occupy a sloping site, the tower could be measured as 123 feet tall.</p>
        <p>Or it could be measured from the Hutchinson River Parkway, which passes about 100 feet below the site. ''If you look up in the air from there, the top of the spire will sit 25 stories above you,'' said Jeffrey D. Grant of Grant, Weinhaus, lawyers for the opponents.</p>
        <p>''It's certainly going to be dominant on the skyline,'' even more so if illuminated at night, said Ms. Gurfein, one of the neighbors. ''It is taller and bigger overall than the Sphinx. When you think of lighting a structure that huge, common sense would dictate that the impact would be enormous.''</p>
        <p>The opponents said their concerns were about the size of the structure, not who would use it. ''There is no spirit of anti-Mormonism whatsoever,'' Mr. Grant said.</p>
        <p>Whether deliberately or coincidentally, however, it seems that zoning cases involve Mormons, Jews, Muslims, Jehovah's Witnesses and other members of smaller denominations more than the larger Roman Catholic and Protestant denominations.</p>
        <p>''At least in the area of land use, minority religions are apparently carrying a much heavier load as they deal with so-called 'generally applicable' and 'neutral' laws,'' said Von G. Keetch, counsel to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Citing a 1997 study by Brigham Young University and the Chicago law firm Mayer, Brown &amp; Platt, Mr. Keetch said that ''minority religions'' accounted for 49 percent of cases regarding the right to locate a religious building at a given site.</p>
        <p>What this means is ''only the rich and powerful can afford to form churches,'' said Marc D. Stern, assistant executive director of the American Jewish Congress.</p>
        <p>CERTAINLY the members of Young Israel of New Rochelle discern a more implacable opposition underlying the land-use debate.</p>
        <p>''There are a lot of sentiments against Orthodox Jews that lie just below the surface,'' said Rabbi Reuven Fink of Young Israel. ''To me, that's the most painful aspect. We're always saying different things -- parking spaces, noise, aesthetics -- when we mean something else.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Koplow, the former president of the congregation, said, ''You have to ask yourself whether the polite form of discrimination is better than people showing up and saying, 'Prevent the Brooklynization of New Rochelle' '' -- as one opponent did in 1994. ''At least you can address overt discrimination for what it is.''</p>
        <p>Young Israel did itself no political favor by the manner in which it acquired the property in 1993. After the synagogue was rebuffed as a buyer, Mr. Koplow's sister-in-law purchased the house in her own name and then sold it to the congregation.</p>
        <p>Rabbi Fink acknowledged the moral quandary involved in accepting this deal. ''This was a heart-wrenching decision for us,'' he said. ''We pride ourselves in being ethical. Meta-ethical. But we can't be nihilistic, either. If you're encountering bigotry and prejudice, every so often you have to counter it with a bit of ingenuity.''</p>
        <p>Councilman Noam Bramson, a Democrat whose district includes the proposed synagogue site, said he did not doubt that ''some portion of the opposition is motivated by anti-Orthodox or anti-Semitic sentiment.</p>
        <p>''But I think it's a distinct minority,'' he said. ''Most people who are concerned about the project are confining their objections to serious and legitimate land-use questions.</p>
        <p>''As a general proposition, religious observance is an extremely important value,'' he said. ''And cities and towns ought to be welcoming to communities of faith. But I don't think it's an absolute value. Religious observance ought to be placed in the context of a wide variety of values, such as the character of neighborhoods, traffic management and environmental protection.''</p>
        <p>The opponents, organized as Neighbors of New Rochelle, said in a flyer that the issue  was solely one of ''converting an otherwise residential neighborhood into a commercial, heavily trafficked area,'' compromising public safety with the addition of hundreds of cars parking on surrounding streets.</p>
        <p>What is sometimes lost in the debate, said leaders of Young Israel, is that all but one of its 240 families live within walking distance of the synagogue. It is currently housed in a 103-year-old former Methodist church at 1228 North Avenue, not far from the proposed building site, which the congregation acquired in 1967 and long ago outgrew.</p>
        <p>''These are the neighborhoods in which we live,'' said Mr. Koplow, a partner in the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz, who was a key negotiator for the tobacco industry in its settlement talks with the state attorneys general. ''The idea that we would do anything that would destroy the value of our homes or the safety of our streets is incredible.''</p>
        <p>The synagogue planned to furnish the required 120 parking spaces by purchasing part of an adjoining city-owned parcel. But in 1998, the city decided not to sell. ''At least a majority of the property was wetland,'' said Mayor Timothy C. Idoni. ''From an environmental standpoint, we've paved over way too much wetland.'' The mayor then tried to broker parking arrangements between Young Israel and Wykagyl Country Club next door or Christ United Methodist Church across the street, to no avail.</p>
        <p>Last year, the congregation was notified that it would have to compile an environmental impact statement. ''We're not by any means trying to block the synagogue nor to destroy a neighborhood,'' said David H. Abrahams, chairman of the Zoning Board of Appeals of New Rochelle. ''We've determined that an E.I.S. is required because it's our belief that there will be a significant impact on the environment.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Koplow described the scope of the impact statement as ''burdensome in the extreme,'' although the congregation prepared what turned out to be a 2 1/4-inch-thick document that even assesses prehistoric archaeological significance. ''How many people who are building a suburban building can tell you what happened on the site 14,000 years ago?'' Mr. Koplow asked.</p>
        <p>New Rochelle's planning consultants, Ferrandino &amp; Associates, have responded with 16 pages of comments and criticisms that Young Israel must address.</p>
        <p>Once the environmental impact statement is certified as complete, the zoning board can take up the submission itself.</p>
        <p>Designed by Graham Gund Architects of Cambridge, Mass., the building would have three parts. ''It helps break down the mass of the building into singular elements in scale with single-family homes,'' said John A. Prokos, a principal in the Gund office.</p>
        <p>The most distinctive element, facing North Avenue, would be an octagonal study hall, or beit midrash, with a peaked roof. Along one side would be a narrow wing with offices and multipurpose rooms. At the back, under a gently bowed roof, would be the main sanctuary, with 607 seats, above the 5,688-square-foot social hall.</p>
        <p>''We're talking about a social hall that would seat about 325 people and have a dance floor for line and ring dancing,'' Mr. Koplow said. ''The argument that this is somehow going to commercialize a residential neighborhood is a bit much.''</p>
        <p>In trying to chart a fair course, Mr. Abrahams allowed that the zoning board would probably be portrayed as obstructionist by the synagogue and not tough enough by the neighborhood opponents. ''We have caught flak from both sides,'' he said, ''and I expect this is just the beginning.''</p>
