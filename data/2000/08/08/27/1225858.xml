        <p>Sen. John McCain received good news when pathologists found no evidence that a malignant melanoma from his left temple had spread to lymph nodes in his face or neck. The nodes were removed during an operation in which surgeons also found no evidence that another melanoma in his left upper arm had spread.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain has had three melanomas. His doctors have pronounced him cured of his first, which was removed from his left shoulder in 1993.</p>

        <p>Mr. McCain has had three melanomas. His doctors have pronounced him cured of his first, which was removed from his left shoulder in 1993.</p>
        <p>People with multiple melanomas do not necessarily fare worse than those with one. The prognosis depends in part on the thickness of a melanoma, and Mr. McCain did not disclose findings of such pathology tests on the one from his temple.</p>
