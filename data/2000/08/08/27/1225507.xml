        <p>The opening of the American Discovery Trail, the United States' first coast-to-coast, nonmotorized trail, will be celebrated on Saturday in San Francisco, at Crissy Field in the Presidio. The six-hour event will begin at 11 a.m., with an opening ceremony at 1 p.m. The event will include booths with trail information and the latest outdoor gear, and appearances by people who have navigated all or part of the trail.</p>
        <p>The 6,356-mile trail runs from Cape Henlopen State Park in Delaware to Limantour Beach in Point Reyes National Seashore, about 45 miles north of San Francisco. In the Midwest, it splits into two branches -- a northern route through Indiana, Illinois, Iowa and Nebraska, and a southern route through Indiana, Illinois, Missouri and Kansas. All told, it traverses 15 states and the District of Columbia.</p>

        <p>The opening of the American Discovery Trail, the United States' first coast-to-coast, nonmotorized trail, will be celebrated on Saturday in San Francisco, at Crissy Field in the Presidio. The six-hour event will begin at 11 a.m., with an opening ceremony at 1 p.m. The event will include booths with trail information and the latest outdoor gear, and appearances by people who have navigated all or part of the trail.</p>
        <p>The 6,356-mile trail runs from Cape Henlopen State Park in Delaware to Limantour Beach in Point Reyes National Seashore, about 45 miles north of San Francisco. In the Midwest, it splits into two branches -- a northern route through Indiana, Illinois, Iowa and Nebraska, and a southern route through Indiana, Illinois, Missouri and Kansas. All told, it traverses 15 states and the District of Columbia.</p>
        <p>Along its route, the trail passes through hundreds of small towns and urban centers like Kansas City, Denver and Cincinnati, and it leads to 14 national parks, 16 national forests and 10,000 sites of historic, cultural and natural significance. The diverse terrain includes back-country footpaths, city streets and canal towpaths. The entire length of the trail can be walked, and many segments are open to bicycles and horses as well. According to the American Discovery Trail Society, the nonprofit group coordinating local efforts to maintain the trail, it is expected that people living near the Discovery Trail rather than long-distance backpackers will be the most frequent users.</p>
        <p>The trail's opening culminates an 11-year effort to select a route in consultation with local, state and federal land managers, to create links between existing trails, and to place signs in the states through which it passes. For information about the trail and available guidebooks and maps, call the American Discovery Trail Society at (800) 663-2387, or go to www.discoverytrail.org.</p>
