        <p>EVER since she and her teenage son, John O'Keefe, moved into a two-bedroom ranch on Defense Hill Road here four years ago as a tenant of the Community Development Corporation of Long Island, Carol McGrann has longed to own her home.</p>
        <p>''My parents owned their house, and I wanted to give my son the same security I had,'' said Ms. McGrann, who grew up in Deer Park.</p>
        <p>This month she saw that wish granted. She became the first person on Long Island -- and the first in the New York metropolitan area -- to buy a house under the federal Section 8 Homeownership Program, whose goal is to turn renters into homeowners.</p>
        <p>Normally, low-income families who qualify for Section 8 vouchers pay only 30 percent of their income for rent, minus a $480 adjustment for each child. Anything needed above that amount is paid by the federal government.</p>
        <p>Under the Section 8 Homeownership Program the family still need pay only 30 percent of its income for housing costs, but that sum can now go toward paying off a mortgage. The Section 8 assistance is used to pay off the monthly mortgage amount that exceeds the family's ability to pay. To qualify for the program, the head of family must be working, unless the recipient is elderly or disabled.</p>
        <p>The legislation was authorized under the  Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998, but has been in preparation since the early 1990's as part of public housing reform legislation.</p>
        <p>The Department of Housing and Urban Development issued guidelines in April 1999 to enable demonstration programs to get under way. Fifteen such programs are now in operation around the country, among them the program developed by the Community Development Corporation of Long Island that enabled Ms. McGrann to buy her house. Final regulations will be issued shortly, said William C. Apgar, assistant secretary of housing.</p>
        <p>''The pilot programs are getting a number of different models going so that other agencies can pick and choose which combination makes sense for the families in their area,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Community Development Corporation, whose president is Wilbur Klatsky, is one of several administering the Section 8 program on Long Island, serving about 1,700  of the region's 10,000 Section 8 recipients.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of Long Island families now receiving Section 8 help could move to  homeownership, said Marianne Garvin, the executive vice president of the organization, whose headquarters are in Centereach. She added that her agency's goal was to help at least 40 families do so every 18 months.</p>
        <p>Helping families increase their income is not enough, she said. ''What we also have to do is increase a family's wealth and increase their asset base because that's what gets them out of poverty.''</p>
        <p>''People have this burning desire to be a homeowner,'' she said, ''and if they receive Section 8 assistance and have a job and work with us to clear up their credit, we have the tools to help them get there.''</p>
        <p>The legislation requires that the Section 8 assistance end after 10 years, under the assumption that by then the family will have built up not only equity in the home but also its ability to make mortgage payments.  Most banks base mortgage loans on the borrower's ability to repay over the life of the loan, usually 30 years.</p>
        <p>Some banks taking part in programs elsewhere in the country are providing first mortgages for the full amount regardless of the fact that the borrower's income might be lower after 10 years, but willing to take that risk, Mr. Apgar of HUD said.</p>
        <p>But under the program developed by the Community Development Corporation, which is chartered to make loans, families will receive a second mortgage from the Suffolk group to cover the gap between the mortgage amount the family can qualify for based on its income and the amount needed to buy the house. The second loan, which will be offered at a below-market interest rate, will be repaid over 10 years out of the family's Section 8 allotment.</p>
        <p>Four lenders, Chase Manhattan Bank, EAB, Fleet Bank and HSBC bank, are taking part in the Suffolk program by providing  first mortgages to buyers.</p>
        <p>Money for the second loans is being raised through grants and through a line of credit  extended by Fannie Mae, the agency that  buys mortgages from banks on the secondary market. The Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation has pledged $350,000 and other grants and fund-raisers are expected to add almost $650,000. Fannie Mae's initial involvement is a $1 million commitment at a below-market interest rate.</p>
        <p>THE Section 8 voucher program is a very interesting way to help families who would otherwise be closed out of homeownership,'' said Jackie O'Garrow, senior deputy director of Fannie Mae's New York office. The program model being offered by the Centereach group ''is so prudent and makes so much sense that we hope to see it replicated,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The program works as follows. Assuming a family of four has an adjusted annual income of $34,040 ($35,000 minus the child allowance) and is renting a three-bedroom house for $1,427 monthly -- a sum that falls within federal guidelines -- it would be paying 30 percent of that income, or a total of $853 a month toward the rent. The remaining $574 a month would be paid out of the Section 8 rental assistance program.</p>
        <p>Under the Section 8 homeownership program, the same family could now assume payments on $120,000 in mortgages. A first mortgage of $67,051 at 8 percent interest would require a monthly payment of $492. A second mortgage of $52,949 provided by the Community Development Corporation at 3 percent over 10 years would require monthly payments of $511, which would be paid under the Section 8 program.</p>
        <p>Additionally, HUD would pay $65 a month toward the family's housing expenses because allowances are also made for utility costs when they are not included in rent.  Thus the family would have $361 of the $853  it had originally paid for rent available for taxes, insurance and utilities.</p>
        <p>Although mortgages with down payments as low as 3 percent are available, combined with closing costs they still represent a daunting hurdle. But even though it may take a family time to accumulate the funds, help is available.</p>
        <p>Section 8 recipients who also enroll in the optional federal Family Self-Sufficiency Program to receive career counseling, job training, and budget and personal counseling can place rent that they would otherwise have to pay if their income rises into an escrow account. When they graduate from the program, which means they must have been working for at least one year, that money can be withdrawn and used to buy a home.</p>
        <p>Under its First Home Club Program, the Federal Home Loan Bank contributes three dollars for every one dollar to savings that a low-income family has earmarked for the  purchase of a home and deposited in a member bank. Additionally, the Suffolk Office of Community Development has set aside $50,000 of federal community development money under the federal HOME program to provide up to $5,000 in downpayment assistance to a family that can match the county grant.</p>
        <p>Victor LaBruna, a sales associate with Coach Realty in Northport, one of several real estate offices in Suffolk that will be helping families with their housing search, said nearly 800 homes in Suffolk are currently listed for $135,000 and under, a price that Ms. Garvin estimated a family of four would be able to afford.</p>
        <p>Ms. McGrann was able to buy her home  on Defense Hill Road in Shoreham for only $80,000 under a special offer from the Community Development Corporation, which in 1996 purchased all 16 houses on her street. The houses, built in the 1950's to house Army personnel assigned to a nearby Nike air-defense missile site, had been put up for sale by the federal government. The corporation fixed them up and rented them to low-income families with the goal of having the tenants own the houses after five years.</p>
        <p>All but two of the 16 families have succeeded in buying their homes. But Ms. McGrann, who earns just $24,000 a year as a medical technician, said she could not have afforded to join the other 13 buyers even at the $80,000 purchase price were it not for the new program.</p>
        <p>She received a $48,000 first mortgage from EAB and a $3,000 second mortgage from the Community Development Corporation, which will be paid off with her Section 8 vouchers. The monthly payment on the second loan is only $29, Ms. McGrann said, ''but sometimes a very small amount makes a big difference because it allowed me to afford the purchase price of the house.'' The Community Development Corporation is also reducing the purchase amount of the Defense Hill Road homes by  $25,000 so long as buyers remain in their houses for at least 10 years.</p>
        <p>JoAnn Signorelli's dream is to buy a townhouse ''with a little yard'' for herself and her 6-year-old daughter. She is now renting  an apartment in Farmingdale, paying $775 toward the $1,070 monthly rent, with the rest coming from Section 8 assistance.</p>
        <p>A single mother, she joined the Family Self-Sufficiency Program two years ago and  went back to school, receiving a bachelor of arts degree from the State University of New York at Stony Brook that recently enabled her to get a job as a clinical social worker. She has already started a savings program, she said, and hopes to buy a home with the help of the Section 8 program by next summer.</p>
        <p>''Homeownership will give my daughter and me a feeling of stability and permanence,'' she said. ''As a single mother, it's not something I could have achieved on my own.''</p>
