        <p>Private Roman Catholic chapels used to be common in this country before World War II, but today  there are few left. One of them is in a small yellow building on Fifth Street in Hoboken. The chapel belongs to the Santa Febronia Catholic Society, an organization founded in 1922 by immigrants from the Sicilian town of Patti. Twice a year a priest will go there to say Mass. The chapel has a little loft with an organ, pews, a beautiful altar and statues made in Italy, among them, St. Febronia, St. Anthony and the Madonna of Tindari, one of the rare icons known as black Madonnas whose image can be traced to antiquity.

        <p>Private Roman Catholic chapels used to be common in this country before World War II, but today  there are few left. One of them is in a small yellow building on Fifth Street in Hoboken. The chapel belongs to the Santa Febronia Catholic Society, an organization founded in 1922 by immigrants from the Sicilian town of Patti. Twice a year a priest will go there to say Mass. The chapel has a little loft with an organ, pews, a beautiful altar and statues made in Italy, among them, St. Febronia, St. Anthony and the Madonna of Tindari, one of the rare icons known as black Madonnas whose image can be traced to antiquity. Armando Torre, 72, is the caretaker of the chapel and member of the Santa Febronia Society. He spoke about the society and its chapel.</p>
        <p>Q. Are you the person who keeps the chapel it in such good condition?</p>
        <p>A. This is my devotion. I wash all the pews down, fix the altar, make sure everything is appropriate for the Mass, call the florist, make sure we go out and buy the candles.</p>
        <p>Q. How did you come to be the caretaker here?</p>
        <p>A. My father was once president of the Santa Febronia Society. He came over in 1904, and my sister was born on the ship. I was born here. The immigrants had no place to go at the time and they formed the society. The society had a welfare fund. If you got sick they gave you $2 a week. But we no longer do that. We used to have 120 members. Now we have 32, and we only have about 12 active members. We had a beautiful lady's auxiliary, very beautiful. They worked hard for the society . They helped us with our dinner dances. They ran their own parties, their own picnics and everything they made they donated to the society.</p>
        <p>Q. What do the active members do?</p>
        <p>A. We established a scholarship for a student at Hoboken High School and a fund at St. Mary's Hospital.</p>
        <p>Q. Does anyone join your society today?</p>
        <p>A. We want them to join. But most people that join organizations they're looking for something. We have nothing to offer them but the love of God or the love of Santa Febronia and the Madonna. If you are devoted to the saint, that's how you become a member. Today it's a different style. People are not really interested. Half of them don't even go to church.</p>
        <p>Q. Do people in Italy know about your chapel?</p>
        <p>A. They know more about this society over there than the people here.  The people in Patti give our literature to people over there. A lot of times tourists from Italy call me and they ask me to open up the chapel for them. They're surprised, like you.</p>
        <p>Q. This building is very old. Does it need any work?</p>
        <p>A. I'd like to redo the steps and the front. That's what I would like. Years ago when my father was alive we could go knocking on doors and say, anything for the Madonna? People were poor. They donated a dollar, 50 cents, whatever. It helped. Today you ask them, they totally ignore you.  ''Oh I'm sorry I have no time for you. Oh, I donated at the store,'' whatever.</p>
        <p>Q. What would you like to see happen with your society?</p>
        <p>A. I would like to see a church and a society that could be active again, new members, people to help the society rebuild the church. We do a lot of work because we are devoted to the saint. When I got sick I prayed to her quite a few times, and with her help I came through open-heart surgery.</p>
        <p>Q. You look great.</p>
        <p>A. I look great thanks to her.</p>
