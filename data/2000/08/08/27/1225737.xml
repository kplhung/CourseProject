      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>I was stung by a honeybee on the back of the head while weeding in the garden one recent afternoon. There was nothing inherently surprising about being stung since upward of 100,000 bees live about 30 feet from where I was working. I could hear the droning of their hives and smell the sweet, waxy scent that emanates from a healthy colony. The air high above my head was thick with bee traffic vectoring downward out of the east at a velocity that is not easily credible unless you have actually seen it. Still, I resented being stung. ''After all I've done for you,'' was my first thought, a sign that I have not quite matured into my role as a beekeeper. But it was not even the sting that I resented. It was the slap of an angry bee -- a suicidal bee -- against my scalp and the knowledge that she had decided at a distance to poison me so quickly that I could not even brush her away first.</p>
        <p>There was something all too emblematic about the moment. I was stooped over in the weeder's posture, left forearm resting on my left knee, right hand wrapped around a rosette of burdock leaves, my head exposed only in that small half-moon between the back of the baseball cap I was wearing and its adjustable strap. I had decided the burdock was a weed, and the bee had decided I was a threat. The bee sting flared up with that familiar white heat and then faded abruptly away. Unless you are allergic to bees, it is much more satisfying to be stung by one than by a mosquito. There is none of that cautious, reluctant, hovering parasitism -- that sneaking effort to steal some blood and then fly away. What a bee is really good at is transmitting hostility.</p>

        <p>I must have looked like a bear to that bee. The beekeepers I know routinely have trouble with bears, which take an almost orgiastic pleasure in scattering a hive's contents. When a bear visits an apiary, it looks as though the bear planted a bomb and then retreated to the edge of the woods to detonate it. Perhaps bears like the salt of the stings as much as they love the sweet of the honey and the taste of the wax and the white brood lying in their cells. We have seen no bears around here, largely because of a busy road and horses and dogs and an electric fence. That does not keep the bees from being bear-wary in their ancestral way.</p>
        <p>But late one night in June -- one of the most beautiful nights this summer -- a black bear crossed the road just in front of us as we were driving home through southern Vermont. It was the fragile end of dusk. Out of thick, sloping cover on the far side of the road, the bear burst at a lope, visible only as long as it took to clear the road. But that was long enough to see that its fur was the same color as the night sky and that the gloss on its fur had the same effect as stars shining out in the night. We coasted through its vapor trail, and if we could have, we would have smelled its very bearness. It was the only thing to think about all the rest of the way home.</p>
