        <p>It was only 11:45 a.m. and already the lines at the concession stand at the Hoyt's Stone Harbor Five movie theater were snaking perilously around the small lobby. The first show of the day, ''Hollow Man'' in theater two, was still 25 minutes off, but the skies at the Jersey Shore were once again -- ugh! -- cloudy and misty.</p>
        <p>''No beach today; got to do something,'' said Mary Williams, of Princeton, dragging her three children quickly past the concession stand and into the ticket line. ''The Nutty Professor II'' at 12:15 p.m. in theater one was going to be the choice. She was lucky enough to get four of the last few tickets, a half-hour before the show. ''Going to be bang-up business here today, I guess,'' she said.</p>

        <p>It was only 11:45 a.m. and already the lines at the concession stand at the Hoyt's Stone Harbor Five movie theater were snaking perilously around the small lobby. The first show of the day, ''Hollow Man'' in theater two, was still 25 minutes off, but the skies at the Jersey Shore were once again -- ugh! -- cloudy and misty.</p>
        <p>''No beach today; got to do something,'' said Mary Williams, of Princeton, dragging her three children quickly past the concession stand and into the ticket line. ''The Nutty Professor II'' at 12:15 p.m. in theater one was going to be the choice. She was lucky enough to get four of the last few tickets, a half-hour before the show. ''Going to be bang-up business here today, I guess,'' she said.</p>
        <p>In fact, it was bang-up business nearly everywhere in this South Jersey beach town that shares Seven-Mile Island with its equally upscale neighbor, Avalon. Common wisdom has been that bad weather at the shore -- and this has been a decidedly down-weather season -- is horrific for businesses that depend on three-and-a-half months of summer sales for most of the profits.</p>
        <p>But merchants, officials and customers alike on a recent dreary Friday offered just the opposite theory: that bad weather, at least in some moderation, is actually good for shore businesses. After all, people lying on the sands in perfect 80-degree weather don't take their wallets out of their pockets. But bring on a 75-degree drizzle and the  spenders are out in force.</p>
        <p>''Retailers certainly benefit somewhat when the weather is intemperate,'' said Dow Stewart, a salesman at the Atlantic Book Store on 96th Street, the main shopping drag in Stone Harbor. ''On inclement days, our business is inordinately good. When the sun comes out, people flock to the beach and there is basically no one to be seen here. On a rainy day, it's project books, summer reading, best-sellers -- really, everything.''</p>
        <p>According to statistics from the Weather Channel, the Jersey Shore had 18 days on which it rained in June, 17 in July and 12 in August through the middle of last week. Some of that rain came at night, to be sure, and not all of it washed out entire beach days, but compared with the essentially dry summer of 1999, it has seemed like Seattle in these parts.</p>
        <p>Tom Markle has carefully studied the weather this summer, but he has yet to be daunted by it. Mr. Markle said his two clothing shops, Mimi's and the Suncatcher, which have been in business in Stone Harbor for 45 years, have done quite well despite the relative lack of sun.</p>
        <p>''What's been good is that there have not really been more than two days in a row of bad weather,'' Mr. Markle said, as he walked past the six-deep line to the ladies' dressing room. ''After two days, your customers get, how should I say, cantankerous and aggressive.''</p>
        <p>In Stone Harbor and many other shore towns, the great bulk of the summer population is renters who have secured their beach week months earlier. Mr. Markle said the ideal weather for business at the shore was nice weather Monday and then a little rain on Tuesday, so people get some shopping in, then clearing by Wednesday afternoon. Then comes a great Thursday and a good Friday with a positive weather forecast for the weekend. Saturday starts off nice and then a fog rolls in and stays through Sunday.</p>
        <p>''People don't feel they are cheated if five days of good weather come and they are ready to spend on those other days,'' Mr. Markle said. ''And that is how it has been most of this summer.''</p>
        <p>Debbie Orzech, who owns the Paisley Christmas Shoppe with her husband, Ed, on the Third Avenue shopping strip, has no complaints about the weather this summer.</p>
        <p>''Sure, if we had a week of cloudy weather, it wouldn't be good,'' she said. ''But we are dead-on with last year's sales. and that is just fine. I think people come down to the shore with a set amount they are going to spend shopping anyway. Good weather; bad weather, that is it.''</p>
        <p>Jackie Sowatsky, of Lancaster, Pa., was one of those shoppers crammed into the aisles at Paisley, which even on 100-degree days sells items like Santa tree ornaments for $18 and 6-foot-5-inch artificial pines for $60. She had found some plastic snowmen she liked when she visited Stone Harbor in June and, with an August mist keeping her from the beach three blocks away, was ready to haul them in.</p>
        <p>''Yep, I'm ready to shop like crazy now,'' she said. ''It's like the casinos. You come down with the money you want to spend shopping and save it for a rainy day. You expect some rain if you are down for a week, so that's part of the shore experience.''</p>
        <p>Part of the experience the past few years is skyrocketing prices for real estate. Local real estate agents estimate that prices for most properties in Stone Harbor and nearby beach communities like Avalon and Sea Isle City have doubled in the last two years. Where in 1995, only one property in Stone Harbor changed hands for more than $1 million, there are now several for sale for more than $3 million. And this summer's rainy days haven't driven down prospects one bit.</p>
        <p>''On a rainy day, people here want to look at houses,'' said Bob Sellers, the sales manager of the Stone Harbor office of Diller and Fisher Real Estate.</p>
        <p>''People know it will not rain forever here and that there is only so much property around,'' said Mr. Sellers. ''I don't anticipate any decrease in sales activity, no matter what the weather does from here on in.''</p>
        <p>Bars and restaurants seem to have had a good season, too, despite the weather, sometimes to the chagrin of the police department.</p>
        <p>''We don't keep statistics on these things, but we certainly feel there are more arrests for things that have to do with too much drinking -- fights and the like -- when the weather is bad,'' said Stone Harbor Police Captain Larry Wilson. ''And there are certainly more traffic accidents downtown when everyone drives in to shop on rainy days.''</p>
        <p>''Basically, we like to keep people at the beach,'' he said. ''That's the point of coming to the shore, and people stay out of trouble that way.''</p>
        <p>And even if the cash registers sometimes boom in bad weather, merchants don't want to depend on gloomy skies for their profit margins.</p>
        <p>''After all, you want happy customers,'' said Mr. Stewart of the Atlantic Book Store. ''And they all smile more on sunny days.''</p>
