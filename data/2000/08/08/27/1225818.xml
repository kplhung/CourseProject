        <p>This aging farm town has yet to meet the New Economy and is barely on speaking terms with the old one. It had staked its hopes for recovery on the nearby North Kern State Prison, but 10 years later, the prison has not lived up to its promise of lowering the town's 26 percent unemployment rate or boosting business.</p>
        <p>Still, Delano lobbied hard and finally persuaded state officials to build another maximum-security prison here, right across the road from North Kern State.</p>
        <p>In a ceremony here on July 4, Gov. Gray Davis celebrated the proposed $335 million prison as a win-win: an increase in prison cells for a system  the California Department of Corrections describes as 195 percent over capacity and a tax-and-revenue boon for Delano, known for its lettuce fields and as the birthplace of the United Farm Workers.</p>
        <p>But the prison, which would be California's 24th new one since the state began the biggest prison building boom in the nation's history in 1980, may not be a done deal. The prospect of yet another prison has galvanized groups across the state, including prison moratorium advocates, liberal members of the State Legislature and those opposed to the ''three strikes'' law.</p>
        <p>A coalition of these groups has sued the state to stop the prison, ostensibly on environmental grounds, but in fact to force the state to re-examine its prison building plans and rethink its strict policies limiting paroles. The groups contend that it would be much more beneficial to the state and offenders if, instead of incarceration, the authorities began pushing treatment for those convicted of drug use and mentoring and job opportunities for young people at risk of going astray.</p>
        <p>The question the coalition is forcing: does California, with a penal system larger than that of most countries, need a new prison?</p>
        <p>The debate reflects -- and will surely influence -- a larger one nationwide over whether the country is building too many prisons.</p>
        <p>The Department of Corrections and the California Correctional Peace Officers Association say the planned 5,000-bed prison is needed to help alleviate overcrowding in a system with roughly 161,500 prisoners in 33 prisons. Farming towns like Delano, where about half the high school students go to college, celebrate new prisons as job centers (though there is scant evidence that prisons provide significant employment to local residents) and as the means to a bigger tax base.</p>
        <p>But those suing to stop the prison say that the meager benefits it would bring to Delano's ailing economy are no reason to build an institution that is superfluous. They say it is the result of the Department of Corrections overestimating projections of new inmates and underusing parole and prison alternative programs. With the state's crime rate dropping for eight straight years and the prisoner population dropping for the first time in 23 years, the critics say, there is no need for yet another state prison.</p>
        <p>''Politicians are trying to wear the cloak of being tough on crime to pander to the fears of voters,'' said John Vasconcellos, a Democratic state senator, about why the Delano prison was approved. ''But voters have repeatedly voted down bonds to build new prisons. They want public safety and leaders that have the insight and leverage to enhance public safety, but not just by locking people up and treating them badly and having them come out worse.''</p>
        <p>Cal Terhune, the director of the Department of Corrections, says that although the number of prisoners has been leveling off, the population projections, based on California's  growth, ''would justify the need for another facility.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Terhune says that a dire need exists for maximum-security cells for the most violent offenders. About 9,000 such inmates are now in cells with less violent offenders, he said, in a mix that has proved volatile.</p>
        <p>Don Novey, president of the correctional officers' union, said that  opponents of the prison had not factored in that the prison system, which he said was short 2,000 guards, had been incredibly overcrowded for 30 years.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Vasconcellos says the timing of the new Delano prison is especially bad because of a voter  initiative on the November ballot, which is expected to be approved, that demands alternatives to incarceration for nonviolent offenders charged with drug possession.</p>
        <p>''The governor blackmailed us into approving it in exchange for other things,'' Mr. Vasconcellos said of the prison. ''The opening of the second Delano prison would be contingent on the Department of Corrections developing and filling 9,000 therapeutic drug treatment beds.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis had asked for two new prisons, the one in Delano and a smaller one in San Diego County; the Legislature approved only one.</p>
        <p>Prison moratorium groups say the correctional officers' union, the most powerful union in the state and one of Mr. Davis's major campaign contributors, is behind pushing the Delano prison through the Legislature.</p>
        <p>They point out that as recently as December, the state canceled plans to build four 500-bed privately run prisons because officials like Mr. Terhune said that the beds were not needed. ''If the state didn't need 2,000 new beds in December, why does it need 5,000 new beds now?'' said Rose Braz, program director for the Critical Resistance in Oakland, which challenges the proliferation of prisons and is a main plaintiff in the suit against the Delano prison</p>
        <p>In a projection of prisoner population, the Department of Corrections overestimated what the population would be by Dec. 31, 1999, by 2,648, according to its figures.</p>
        <p>Those fighting the new prison say that regardless of the reason, the figures prove that a new prison is counterintuitive.</p>
        <p>Eric Etelson, of the National Lawyers Guild, another plaintiff against the Delano prison, said that the suit seeks to get to the root of the prison population explosion in California. ''What's fundamentally wrong with the California prison system is that it's too big,'' Mr. Etelson said. ''There are too many people who shouldn't be in prison who are.''</p>
        <p>For towns that have staked their hopes of rebirth on the construction of a prison and what it should bring -- for tax purposes, all inmates are considered residents -- the philosophical debate is about what a prison will do for the economy.</p>
        <p>Skepticism is growing in these communities. One in three new prisons built in the state since 1980 are in the Central Valley, yet the unemployment rate in the valley remains at five times the state average.</p>
        <p>And here in Delano, a city of 35,000 residents about 25 miles from Bakersfield, the answer is decidedly mixed. Napoleon Madrid, the mayor, says that the first prison was supposed to bring jobs and did not. In 1990, the unemployment rate was the same as it is now.</p>
        <p>Only 7 percent to 9 percent of the jobs go to local residents, the prison's opponents say, and those are the low-paying service jobs. Of the 1,600 jobs projected for the new prison, Mr. Madrid said that the Department of Corrections estimated that only 72 would go to the residents of Delano.</p>
