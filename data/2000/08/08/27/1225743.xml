        <p>WHAT if they gave an election and everyone came?</p>
        <p>There would be profound surprise, for one thing. Turnout in the last three American presidential elections has hovered at around half of the nation's voting-age population, which has prompted a good deal of hand-wringing.</p>
        <p>It's obvious that if everyone eligible voted this November, the number of ballots cast would roughly double. But would those 100 million or so additional votes change the outcome for the main contenders, George W. Bush and Al Gore?</p>
        <p>The answer is: maybe yes, maybe no.</p>
        <p>First, the maybe yes. If the race is close, then any usual nonvoters who turn out have the potential to decide the outcome. And races that go down to the wire typically generate higher turnout, because of the uncertainty, and heightened competition. After Labor Day, as each party's post-convention bounce in the polls levels off, voter surveys will give the first good indication of how close the 2000 election is likely to be.</p>
        <p>Now, the maybe no. It may be that this year's likely nonvoters differ so much in how they are lining up behind the candidates that if they voted, a different candidate would be elected. But that would be in contrast to every election since 1988. A statistical analysis of those three elections by The New York Times suggests that if nonvoters had voted, only the margin of victory would have changed, not the victor.</p>
        <p>The statistics say that if the ''votes'' of nonvoters had been counted, George Bush would have increased his margin of success over Michael Dukakis in 1988; there would have been no change in the margin of Bill Clinton's win in 1992, and his margin would have increased to a landslide in 1996.</p>
        <p>The similarities of the preferences of voters and nonvoters suggest that in modern campaigns, with saturating news coverage and endless commercials driving home candidates' positions, voters and nonvoters may reach similar conclusions and take sides in roughly similar proportions.</p>
        <p>Of course, assessing opinions is an inexact science. And there's much more data to go on for voters than for nonvoters.</p>
        <p>The reactions and tentative conclusions being formed by likely voters are measured by many polls and also widely broadcast and published. The only way to know nonvoters' preferences is through the infrequent public opinion polls -- with their inherent degrees of error in sampling and measurement -- that bother to address them. And there are other gray areas. Nonvoters who become voters may be motivated by something that also changed their minds.</p>
        <p>The New York Times/CBS News polls, conducted just before Election Day in each of the last three presidential races, were designed to determine whether usual voters and usual nonvoters agreed, disagreed slightly or disagreed strongly in their candidate preferences.</p>
        <p>In 1988, voters preferred Mr. Bush by 8 percentage points. Nonvoters that year also preferred Mr. Bush over Mr. Dukakis, but by 16 percentage points. If everyone had turned out to vote, Mr. Bush's margin over Mr. Dukakis would have been somewhat larger than it was.  Same winner, but bigger.</p>
        <p>Voters and nonvoters each favored Bill Clinton over President Bush in 1992, and by the same margin, 6 percentage points. Had everyone voted that year, there would have been the same winner and the same victory margin. But Ross Perot would have gained an additional 2 percentage points over the 19 percent he actually received.</p>
        <p>In 1996, by contrast, voters and nonvoters held preferences that differed strongly. Bill Clinton beat Bob Dole by 8 percentage points, but among nonvoters, Mr. Clinton was the overwhelming choice. If everyone had voted, it would have been a 24-point Clinton blowout. (In 1976, Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter ran a close race, but nonvoters were not polled.)</p>
        <p>The seeming pattern in these three elections -- that with everyone voting the winner would have remained the same in each case, with an enlarged victory margin in two of the three cases -- provides ammunition for several arguments.</p>
        <p>It shows that nonvoters are not invariably more pro-Democratic than voters, as stereotypes suggest.  Nonvoters were more pro-Bush than voters in 1988, more pro-Clinton in 1996 and indistinguishable in their preferences in 1992.</p>
        <p>Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania and author of ''Everything You Think You Know About Politics . . . And Why You're Wrong'' (Basic Books), said that the finding of few big differences in candidate preferences of voters and nonvoters conforms to ''the standard finding of political scientists.'' But she said she was still surprised because ''nonvoters, tending to have lower socio-economic status, might be expected to be more Democratic.''</p>
        <p>But does the voter/nonvoter pattern also suggest that it doesn't matter that nonvoters stay home?</p>
        <p>Only if the sole purpose of voting is to elect someone. But citizens are urged to participate in politics not only to elect people, but also, perhaps even primarily, for their own good. Dennis F. Thompson, Alfred North Whitehead professor of political philosophy at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, has argued in his book ''The Democratic Citizen'' (Cambridge University Press) that participation can help develop citizens' awareness, knowledge and self-realization.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the three polls measured only how voters and nonvoters reacted to the candidates, issues, and appeals in the campaigns that were actually waged in those election years. They cannot show what public reactions might have been if the candidates, issues and messages had been different. And if everyone voted, those might become quite different.</p>
        <p>Nonvoters tend to be younger, less well off in income and education, less partisan, less politically involved and more alienated from the system. If parties and candidates actually expected everyone to vote, they might find themselves having to revise their strategies, raising quite different issues.</p>
        <p>Campaigns might revolve as much around health care for poor children, child care for working mothers, and job training and college tuition for working-class and lower-middle-class youths, as they do now around prescription drugs for the elderly and tax cuts for the affluent.</p>
        <p>In 1996, turnout was 49 percent of the voting-age population, defined as United States residents 18 or older. In 1992 it was 55 percent. In 1988, despite earnest get-out-the-vote drives, it was 50 percent. But the category includes some people who are legally ineligible to vote, like noncitizens, felons and those who have not yet met local residency requirements, so actual turnout would have been a bit higher in each case.</p>
        <p>One hundred percent turnout may always be a fantasy, practically speaking. But, if political participation brings civic awareness, then a higher voting rate may still be a desirable goal, even if it does not change the outcome of elections.</p>
