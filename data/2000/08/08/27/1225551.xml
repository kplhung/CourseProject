      <abstract>
        <p>More than 2,000 applications pour in for 68 new low-cost apartments in South Bronx; unlike other low-cost housing, which is usually drab, new Intervale Avenue Apartments have facade of muted shades of blue, yellow and burnt orange; photo (M)</p>

        <p>The shortage of modestly priced apartments in New York is well known. So it is hardly surprising that when a lottery was held recently for the 68 new low-cost apartments at 1118 Intervale Avenue, at the corner of East 167th Street in the South Bronx, more than 2,000 applications poured in.</p>
        <p>What would be surprising to people who think of low-cost housing as uniformly drab is that large sections of the exterior of the seven-story Intervale Avenue Apartments appear to be painted in muted shades of blue, yellow and burnt orange.</p>

        <p>The shortage of modestly priced apartments in New York is well known. So it is hardly surprising that when a lottery was held recently for the 68 new low-cost apartments at 1118 Intervale Avenue, at the corner of East 167th Street in the South Bronx, more than 2,000 applications poured in.</p>
        <p>What would be surprising to people who think of low-cost housing as uniformly drab is that large sections of the exterior of the seven-story Intervale Avenue Apartments appear to be painted in muted shades of blue, yellow and burnt orange.</p>
        <p>Actually, the colors are not painted on but produced by applying colored synthetic stucco known as dryvit to two inches of rigid insulation, which in turn is applied to concrete block.</p>
        <p>''It gives affordable housing a distinctive look that tenants can take pride in,'' said Marvin H. Meltzer, a principal of the Meltzer/Mandl architectural firm. ''We want the colors to be attractive, not too gaudy, that we can fit into a fairly tight budget.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Meltzer said he was particularly struck by the building's long, gently curving facade, which follows the street's property line. ''It reminds me of the old masonry facades that are typical of the Bronx,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The 61,600-square-foot building, constructed on what was formerly a vacant lot, also has a 1,500-square-foot community room and a 1,000-square-foot courtyard. The first few tenants are already in, and the building is expected to be fully occupied soon.</p>
        <p>The Intervale Avenue Apartments project is the fourth such colorful low-income housing collaboration between Meltzer/Mandl and the Atlantic Development Group, a five-year-old Manhattan construction company. Two more such collaborations are in the works, including Intervale II about a block away, which will use a similar color scheme.</p>
        <p>''We do a lot of new construction of low-income housing,'' said Marc Altheim, a principal of Atlantic Development, adding that he and Peter Fine, the other principal, were previously with not-for-profit institutions.</p>
        <p>Such projects require that one-half the apartments be two bedrooms, so the Intervale Avenue Apartments consist of 34 two-bedroom apartments plus 17 studios and 17 one-bedrooms, at rents ranging from $425 a month to $610. Income eligibility, Mr. Altheim said, ranges from a maximum of $17,000 a year for a single person to $35,000 for a family of four.</p>
        <p>''We're only able to do these projects, Mr. Altheim said, ''because they're financed with low-interest loans by the New York City Housing Development Corporation.''</p>
