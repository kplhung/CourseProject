        <p>How much you think you will spend on back-to-school shopping may be far different from the reality, a new study suggests.</p>
        <p>Consumers who set aside a few hundred dollars for each child may find themselves woefully short. The average family will spend $5,423 to prepare for the new school year, for students in all levels of school, from elementary to college, according to the national study, which asked 1,002 people about their back-to-school purchases.</p>
        <p>''There are a lot of peripheral costs that don't get added in initially,'' said Steve Rhode, the president and co-founder of Myvesta.org, formerly Debt Counselors of America, a nonprofit financial organization in Rockville, Md., that was co-sponsor of the study with Capital One Financial in Falls Church, Va.</p>
        <p>Some parents buy another car, or maybe airline tickets, to send a college student to school, while some buy jerseys and other equipment for their elementary-school children who are involved in sports activities. And some schools require tuition be paid up front, Mr. Rhode said.</p>
        <p>The study estimated that on average, a family would spend $2,457 on tuition and fees, for example, $1,610 on transportation and $591 on electronics.</p>
        <p>''Back-to-school spending comes at the worst possible time, after that summer vacation, but right before the holidays,'' Mr. Rhode said.</p>
        <p>He suggested involving children in money discussions, to teach them about financial responsibility. ''Let them understand that there are limits to money and hard decisions to be made,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Myvesta also advises parents to keep track of this year's spending to help set next year's budget. And it urges consumers to pay more than the minimum amounts due on credit cards. If a shopper pays only the minimum on a bill of $5,423 with an interest rate of 17.99 percent, Myvesta.org calculates, it will take 48 years to pay off the debt, which ends up totaling $20,843.</p>
        <p>''We live in a minimum-payment mentality,'' Mr. Rhode said. ''We mortgage our future for instant gratification.''</p>
