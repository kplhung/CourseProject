        <p>The soap opera-like saga of the Miami Dolphins' J. J. Johnson, who will most likely start at running back, finally ended late last week.</p>
        <p>It did so with a cryptic statement from the National Football League that said reports of his pending suspension for steroid use were in error and that he faced no such penalty. The statement actually left more questions than answers about what happened in Johnson's puzzling situation that may be a landmark drug case for the league.</p>
        <p>Johnson's situation again put under a microscope the larger issue of steroid use in the N.F.L. and illustrated how difficult a job pro football has in catching players who use performance-enhancing drugs.</p>
        <p>The N.F.L. is clearly making an effort to catch cheaters. Masking agents and the more recent phenomenon of players blaming positive tests on dietary supplements sometimes thwart those efforts.</p>
        <p>According to a Dolphins official, it was indeed over-the-counter muscle-building supplements that were at the center of the Johnson case.</p>
        <p>The official said Johnson failed his steroid test last November. Johnson appealed the suspension, saying the team gave him an over-the-counter supplement that elevated his testosterone level, and he said he should not be suspended since the team gave the supplement to him.</p>
        <p>Johnson's version illustrated the problem with steroid testing in relation to supplements, since Johnson's explanation created a large loophole in the league's policy.</p>
        <p>Here is what happened, the Miami official said: After the positive test, Johnson told the N.F.L. that he received the supplement from one of the team's trainers. The trainer, however, told the N.F.L. that he did not give Johnson the supplement that led to his positive test. The trainer was giving the supplement, a legal one, to many of the Dolphins players, and none of those players has tested positive for steroids.</p>
        <p>Then, the Miami official said, Johnson changed his story and said he purchased the supplement over the counter. When the N.F.L. said that was not a valid excuse, Johnson then changed his story for the final time, saying the positive test was because of the muscle-building supplement creatine and because he had received it from the trainer, it was the trainer's fault.</p>
        <p>This put the N.F.L. in a difficult position. The league did not necessarily believe Johnson, the Miami official maintained, but could not disprove his story. Even though the N.F.L. sends players and trainers a list of banned over-the-counter substances, some of those substances are not listed on the bottles of the products; so it is conceivable that Johnson used an over-the-counter product that contained an illegal substance that was not listed.</p>
        <p>Last year a kicker tested positive for steroids and used a similar supplement defense. He was not suspended.</p>
        <p>The league gave Johnson a similar break and did not suspend him the mandatory four games for a positive steroid test.</p>
        <p>The Johnson case was an important one for this reason: Aware that Johnson's defense could reveal a loophole in its steroid policy, the official said, the N.F.L. needed to take immediate steps to close it. Imagine if every player who tested positive for steroids could simply blame it on supplements.</p>
        <p>So the league took action. First, the N.F.L. has recently made it clear to teams that blaming positive tests on supplements will no longer be tolerated.</p>
        <p>Then, about one month ago, according to several team executives, the N.F.L., in a memo to all teams, warned that any trainer who knowingly or unknowingly distributes a supplement that contained a prohibited substance is subject to a fine, as is the team.</p>
        <p>Before the N.F.L. made public his successful appeal, The Miami Herald, CBS Sportsline, ESPN and a sideline reporter on 'Monday Night Football'' all reported that Johnson was going to be suspended for violating the league's steroid policy.</p>
        <p>Last Thursday, the N.F.L. responded with a statement that said: ''Reports that J. J. Johnson of the Miami Dolphins will be suspended for violating the league's policy on steroids are not true. We cannot comment any further due to the confidentiality of the policy.''</p>
        <p>The ambiguous statement did not exactly exonerate Johnson. It did not say reports that he failed a steroid test were false. Was Johnson fined? Was he warned that if he again tested positive -- supplement excuse or not -- he would be suspended? No one will say.</p>
        <p>What is clear is that Johnson dodged a major blow to his season. But as the N.F.L. toughens its stance on steroids, any player who tries to cheat in the future might not be so lucky.</p>
        <p>Embracing Black Quarterbacks</p>
        <p>There was a time in the N.F.L. when black quarterbacks were routinely discriminated against. Now, the league seems to be embracing the black quarterback. In the 1999 draft, four black quarterbacks -- Akili Smith, Donovan McNabb, Daunte Culpepper and Shaun King -- were drafted in the first two rounds.</p>
        <p>If Virginia Tech quarterback Michael Vick declares himself eligible for the draft after this season, scouts say he would most likely be the first player selected.</p>
        <p>Black quarterbacks are aware of the changing N.F.L. culture and of their place in professional football history.</p>
        <p>''When I was coming into the league, believe it or not, there were people still saying black quarterbacks weren't smart enough,'' McNabb said, ''or we were only good athletes, or we couldn't read defenses. Now people recognize everything we can do.''</p>
        <p>Miller Ruffles Owner's Hair</p>
        <p>Several team executives and one owner went out of their way this week to bash the ''Monday Night Football'' analyst Dennis Miller, who they feel is taking too many cheap shots at N.F.L. personnel during the broadcast.</p>
        <p>What seemed to irk some in the league was Miller's reference to an owner's supposed toupee and Miller's remarks questioning the competency of an official.</p>
        <p>It was only a matter of time before Miller began saying things that would upset some league personnel, who can be extremely thin skinned.</p>
        <p>When asked if he planned to complain to ABC Sports or the N.F.L., the owner, who asked not to be identified, said: ''Not yet. But it's only the preseason.''</p>
        <p>Around the League</p>
        <p>General Manager Carmen Policy of the Cleveland Browns met with N.F.L. officials last week about his role in possible salary-cap violations when he was in the San Francisco 49ers' front office. In an interview, Policy maintained he had done nothing wrong and wanted to make clear he has no ill feelings toward the current 49er ownership. . . . Philadelphia Eagles running back Cecil Martin blocked for the Giants' Ron Dayne when both played at Wisconsin. Martin was told that in New York there was some worry about Dayne's at times sluggish preseason. ''The only people who should worry about Ron are the people who will try to tackle him,'' Martin said. . . . The Jacksonville Jaguars may be $25 million over the projected salary cap for the 2001 season, but they are not panicking. The Jaguars never use escalator clauses or voidable years in their contracts. That means they have more flexibility when it comes to restructuring deals. . . . San Diego Chargers quarterback Ryan Leaf is continuing his comeback from oblivion. After two disastrous years, Leaf may be turning his career around after a solid preseason and will most likely start in the opener at Oakland next Sunday.</p>
