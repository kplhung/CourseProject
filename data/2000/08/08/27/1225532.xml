        <p>NO woman will be elected president in 2000, but the Women's Campaign School at Yale is mounting a major initiative to break the last glass ceiling for women in American politics.</p>
        <p>''We want to select a woman out of the solid base of candidates from the upper ranks of the state and federal level who are well prepared to campaign for the top office,'' Carolanne Curry, a former board member at the campaign school, said at the group's public-speaking seminar held at Yale on Aug. 19. Ms. Curry is starting a Web site called FirstWomanPresident.com, which she plans to have up by Labor Day.</p>
        <p>The Women's Campaign School, which teaches women how to run for office, is guiding women toward every level of government, not just the top.</p>
        <p>Allyson Stollenwerck, 29, a board member and Yale Law School graduate, urged young women to get involved at the local level by running for school boards, town councils or zoning commissions.</p>
        <p>''Important decisions are being made at the local level,'' she said. ''It's a great place to get started. We need more young women to get involved early and acquire the skills they need to lead.''</p>
        <p>Among the most critical skills are the ability to deliver a speech and to debate.</p>
        <p>Patricia Jackaway, vice president of the Prescott Group, a communications consulting and training company, led the recent seminar, which drew about 50 people. She said preparation was the key to conquering anxiety and avoiding distraction. She suggested using large index cards, highlighted to accentuate points and numbered to avoid losing their order. The cards can be hidden in a jacket pocket and withdrawn discreetly or placed on a lectern to avoid the appearance of reading them, she said.</p>
        <p>To resolve a high-pitched or quavering voice, she advised breathing deep in the diaphragm and modulating the voice to its lowest pitch. She stressed the four C's in keeping the attention of an audience: be clear, concise, creative and consistent.</p>
        <p>''Look people in the eye,'' Ms. Jackaway said. ''If it's a large audience, divide it into quadrants and balance your eye contact by moving through the quadrants. If you use hand gestures, make sure they are crisp, not flighty.''</p>
        <p>During a morning coffee break, Madhvi Verna, a Greenwich lawyer, and Roberta Willis of Lakeville, a Democratic candidate for Connecticut's 64th District, bemoaned the lack of female leaders. They agreed speech making is a key area where women need to concentrate their energy if they are to be taken seriously for top elected office.</p>
        <p>Barbara B. Kennelly, a former member of Congress from Hartford, flew to Connecticut from the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles to address the group.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kennelly named some speakers whom she described as possessing presidential stature: Olympia J. Snowe, a Republican senator from Maine, and Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, a Democrat from Maryland.</p>
        <p>''These are magnificently talented women,'' she said. ''I was disappointed they weren't even mentioned as vice presidential candidates.''</p>
        <p>As a congresswoman, Ms. Kennelly was the first woman to serve on the House Committee on Intelligence. She emphasized her years in office, spanning 23 years in Congress, representing Connecticut's First District, as Secretary of the State and as a member of the Hartford Court of Common Council.</p>
        <p>A native of Hartford, Ms. Kennelly spent the past year in Washington as a counselor to the Social Security Administration and recently accepted a position as adviser on federal affairs at Baker and Hostetler, a Washington law firm.</p>
        <p>Having served her state and nation as a politician for many years, Ms. Kennelly said she leaves the responsibility of running for elective office to the next generation of women. ''People say politics isn't fun anymore, but it was never intended to be fun,'' she said. ''It's a duty and responsibility.''</p>
        <p>Many of the women at the seminar had attended the campaign school's weeklong training session in June. Graduates of that program spoke highly of the knowledge and networking opportunities they gained.</p>
        <p>Janet M. McCarty of North Haven, who is running for first selectman of her city, said attending the campaign school was like being ''sprinkled with magic dust'' because so many of the participants go on to win elections. Evelyn Navarro Tamarin of Manhattan said the training catapulted her to run for City Council.</p>
        <p>Robin Asken of Westport described how the training opened doors for her.</p>
        <p>''The networking is incredible,'' she said. ''I mentioned to a friend at the Grand Union that I had graduated from the Women's Campaign School at Yale, and she asked if I would like to run her husband's campaign, and I agreed to do it. Bill Scheffler is running on the Democratic ticket for State Representative in the 136th District.''</p>
        <p>Dolores Sedacca of East Williston, N.Y., said she became involved with Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign for New York senator as a result of her campaign school training.</p>
        <p>Denise W. Merrill, co-chairwoman at the campaign school and a State Representative from Connecticut's 54th District, urged women to become involved in politics and improve their public-speaking skills.</p>
        <p>Although women make up one-third of the Connecticut State Legislature, and the Democratic speaker of the house is a woman, Ms. Merrill said there were ''still not enough women with strong, powerful voices. Even though I debated in high school and I'm a lawyer, I felt ill-prepared to speak in public,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The Women's Campaign School at Yale holds one-day seminars throughout the year. For more information visit the school's Web site at www.wcsyale.org.</p>
