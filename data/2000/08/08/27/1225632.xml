        <p>Why would a seasoned opera diva drive 60 miles to sing at 3 a.m. for no pay to a sleep-deprived audience? Dan Montez, director of the four-year-old Taconic Opera, says it's no mystery. Artists perform gratis at the company's yearly Operathons for two reasons, he said. The 30-hour nonstop free event gets plenty of media attention -- a career boost for singers -- and also lets performers add a notch to their repertorial belts. ''One of the ways I get higher-caliber singers to sing with a new company like my own is they can sing something they don't have on their resume,'' he said. ''Maybe they haven't done a 'Lucia,' for example, and want to try it out on my company before singing it somewhere else.''</p>
        <p>Pajamas will be optional after midnight, Mr. Montez said, when 100 singers take their turns between 6 p.m. Sept. 8 and midnight Sept. 9 at this year's Operathon, to be held at the Country Club at Lake MacGregor in Mahopac. A hint to the insomnia-prone: some of the best singers will perform in the wee hours. They are the company regulars and exhaust themselves out of loyalty. The unpredictable unknowns, those who use the Operathon as an audition for Mr. Montez, tend to come and go throughout the event. This year's noteworthy names include Sherrill Milnes, the Metropolitan Opera baritone, who will sing Sept. 9 from 8 to 10 p.m., and Lloyd Moss of WQXR (96.3 FM), one of the many volunteer masters of ceremony. In addition, Seunghye Lee, soprano lead of the company's production of ''Lucia di Lammermoor,'' will give a preview of the opera with others in the cast Sept. 9 from 6 to 10 p.m. Auctions and raffles turn the event into a fund-raiser. Information: (914) 739-2165.</p>
