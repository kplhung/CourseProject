        <p>A 54-year-old urologist in Chatham Township, N.J., was arrested yesterday and charged with killing her elderly parents, prosecutors said.</p>
        <p>The doctor, Kathleen Hagen, called the police yesterday morning at 6:48 from the house on Fairmount Avenue where she lived with her parents, James Hagen, 86, and Idella Hagen, 92, and reported them dead, John B. Dangler, the Morris County prosecutor, said in a statement.</p>
        <p>The police found the two victims dead in their beds, Mr. Dangler said. The county medical examiner, Dr. Ronald Suarez, found that they had been asphyxiated, the statement said. They had been dead for at least several days, Mr. Dangler said.</p>
        <p>He said Dr. Hagen was a former administrator at a New Jersey teaching hospital who moved to the Virgin Islands to run a hotel. When the business failed, she moved back to New Jersey and had been living with her parents since July. She is being held in lieu of $2.5 million bail.</p>
