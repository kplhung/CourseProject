        <p>INCREASINGLY, Indian restaurants in the Hudson Valley have been enhancing their menus with commentary on the provenance of some of their offerings. As these kitchens provide dishes from many regions, a bit of history or geography can turn a meal into a journey. At Jaipore, we traveled by fork through a dozen areas, from the Hindu Kush and the Himalayas to Cape Comorin.</p>
        <p>On our visits to India, meat dishes have rarely impressed us, and the same can be said about those produced here. We have become accustomed to chewy and flavorless lamb chunks and dry tandoori chicken and take note of the rare occasion that surprises us. So diners would do well to explore other dishes, healthful as well as delicious, incorporating legumes, grains, vegetables and fish, and few places transform these ingredients into potent mouthfuls better than Jaipore.</p>

        <p>INCREASINGLY, Indian restaurants in the Hudson Valley have been enhancing their menus with commentary on the provenance of some of their offerings. As these kitchens provide dishes from many regions, a bit of history or geography can turn a meal into a journey. At Jaipore, we traveled by fork through a dozen areas, from the Hindu Kush and the Himalayas to Cape Comorin.</p>
        <p>On our visits to India, meat dishes have rarely impressed us, and the same can be said about those produced here. We have become accustomed to chewy and flavorless lamb chunks and dry tandoori chicken and take note of the rare occasion that surprises us. So diners would do well to explore other dishes, healthful as well as delicious, incorporating legumes, grains, vegetables and fish, and few places transform these ingredients into potent mouthfuls better than Jaipore.</p>
        <p>Many mouth-watering ways to begin include ragara, flat potato cakes spread with almost molten chickpeas and onion; uthappam, a rice and lentil pizza-like affair; lassani gobi, cauliflower florets sauteed with mild garlic; and Madras aloo, diced pan-fried potatoes tossed with mustard seeds and corn niblets. Dal (yellow split peas cooked almost to a puree with onion and mild spices) is superb here. Scoop it up on pieces of nan or spoon it over rice.</p>
        <p>While passable, vegetable bhajias (deep fried fresh spinach leaves and onions) proved somewhat oily, and masala dosai (potatoes and peas wrapped in a delicate golden rice pancake) should have been hot and crisp, rather than lukewarm and flabby. None of the promised cream sauce came with shrimp bagari; instead three large tangy shrimp arrived on a small salad. Delicious, but not what was ordered.</p>
        <p>Apart from puffy oven-baked nan, other breads deserved consideration. Wholewheat pudina paratha, a folded bread, had fresh mint tucked inside. And khandari khulcha brought nan filled with tiny nuts and golden raisins.</p>
        <p>As for seafood, a tasty vegetable sauce was more impressive than the cubes of halibut (fish bhaja Calcutta style) it contained. Although a flood of yogurt-coriander sauce turned eating good shrimps Mangalore into a fishing expedition, the flavor couldn't be faulted. And shrimp malai kebab was first choice among tandoori dishes; six big shrimp came in a luscious gingery sauce.</p>
        <p>Tandoori-cooked minced lamb Jaipuri kebab had little flavor and was unappealingly dense and grainy. In addition, the lamb in both kaju pasanda in a rich creamy cashew sauce and Balti mirchwala, a stewed dish, was chewy and dry, despite the sauce.</p>
        <p>Nonmeat entrees were luscious:  lentil dumplings with okra bobbing in buttermilk sauce (more kozhambu), pureed mustard greens with kernels of bright corn (sarson ka sag), Indian cheese (paneer) with spinach or peas, round vegetable dumplings in creamy sauce (malai kofta) and spinach dumplings (palak kofta Akbari -- a special).</p>
        <p>Desserts were skippable.</p>
        <p>Buffets seemed freshly maintained and reasonably priced. A three-course a la carte dinner averages $25 without drinks, tax and tip, and, what with rice and breads, sharing a course might be prudent. Jaipore is near Route 202 between Brewster and Croton Falls.</p>
        <p>Jaipore  Route 22, Brewster.  (845) 277-3549.</p>
        <p>VERY GOOD</p>

        <p>CREDIT CARDS -- Major cards accepted.</p>
        <p>HOURS -- Lunch or brunch, noon to 3 p.m. Dinner, 5 to 10 p.m.</p>
        <p>RESERVATIONS -- Taken for parties of more than three.</p>
        <p>WHEELCHAIR ACCESS -- Three steps at entrance.</p>
