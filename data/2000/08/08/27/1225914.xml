        <p>HAMMOND-Reese, 71. Of Port St. Lucie, FL. on August 10 after a long illness. Retired in 1990 as Director of Research &amp; Education for the International Union of Operating Engineers in Washington, D.C., a post he had held since 1961. He was a fifty year member of Local 94, IUOE in NYC. Prior to 1961, he was a union organizer in the NYC metro area for the IUOE and for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. His commitment to equal employment opportunities and job training were exceeded only by his dedication to racial justice. He is survived by his wife Shirley. A memorial service will be held at a later date in Wilmington, NY. Donations in his memory may be made to the Reese Hammond Scholarship Fund, Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations, Ithaca, New York, or Hospice of Martin/St. Lucie Counties, 2030 Southeast Ocean Blvd, Stuart, FL. 34996.</p>
