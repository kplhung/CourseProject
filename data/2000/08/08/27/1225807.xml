        <p>They traded clutch shots and dramatic moments into overtime today in a classic championship game. In the end, a sign in the raucous and adoring crowd at the Compaq Center summed up the emotions around professional sports' latest dynasty: ''Coop! Is that your final answer?''</p>
        <p>Yes, it was.</p>
        <p>Cynthia Cooper headed into retirement in glorious fashion as the Comets won their fourth straight Women's National Basketball Association championship with a thrilling 79-73 victory over the gutsy and stunned Liberty. The Comets won the series, 2-0.</p>
        <p>Cooper, who had previously announced her retirement and then was named the most valuable player of her fourth straight finals, drilled a 3-point shot with 21.5 seconds left in regulation to tie the score at 64-64. She added two baskets in overtime and celebrated with a tearful and joyous farewell dance with her teammates at halfcourt.</p>
        <p>''This is a great moment in women's basketball and a great moment for the  Houston Comets,'' Cooper said. ''When everyone counted us out, we hung in  there. We could have just let our guard down and said, hey, we've got another game tomorrow. But we played tough every single minute, like it was live or die right now.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, the Liberty was poised to force a third and final game when Tari Phillips made a strong move inside for a layup, putting the Liberty ahead by 64-61 with 32.1 seconds left in regulation.</p>
        <p>But once again the heroics belonged to the Comets, who are the only champions in the W.N.B.A.'s four-year history. For the third time, they beat the Liberty in the finals, and the Comets swept through their two-of-three-game playoff series with a 6-0 record, beating the Sacramento Monarchs, the Los Angeles Sparks and the Liberty.</p>
        <p>''It's a tough situation, knowing that the business you came here to finish was left undone again,'' said Liberty guard Teresa Weatherspoon, who along with Phillips fouled out in overtime. ''It's painful, man, real painful.''</p>
        <p>Cooper finished with 25 points and hit the game-saving shot, but Sheryl Swoopes hurt the Liberty the most. Swoopes, the league's regular-season M.V.P., shook off a first-half ankle injury and led all scorers with 31 points, including 7 in overtime. She made 11 of 18 shots (3 of 4 from behind the 3-point line) and 6 of 7 free throws. She also grabbed six rebounds.</p>
        <p>Tina Thompson added 11 points and 8 rebounds for the Comets, who shot 43.8 percent from the field and missed only one of their 19 free-throw attempts.</p>
        <p>Phillips led the Liberty with 20 points and 7 rebounds before fouling out with 3:57 left in overtime. The Liberty shot 40 percent and made 18 of 21 free throws.</p>
        <p>''We should be playing tomorrow,'' Liberty Coach Richie Adubato said. ''It was one great play after another for both teams. Swoopes was sensational and Cooper made the big shot. I just wish we had caught a break or two, because if we had, we'd be going to a third game and all the pressure would have been on them.'</p>
        <p>With 25 seconds left in regulation and perhaps in her career, Cooper dribbled off a pick from Thompson. Phillips came out to challenge Cooper, but the Liberty's center was too late.</p>
        <p>''I saw Tari Phillips come out of the corner of my eye,'' Cooper said, ''and I thought: 'If she doesn't jump, I'm going to hit this. I'm going to shoot it, and I'm going to hit it.' That's all I was focusing on. I knew I wasn't going to try to penetrate or anything.''</p>
        <p>The impact of Cooper's 3-pointer carried into overtime, which the Comets controlled from the start en route to outscoring the Liberty, 15-9.</p>
        <p>''This one is the sweetest,'' Swoopes said. ''This one is more special than the other three for the simple fact that no one really expected us to be here, no one expected us to defend, no one expected us to win four in a row.''</p>
        <p>The Comets appeared to have the Liberty beaten midway through the second half. But the Liberty -- behind by 9 points -- made sure that the Comets would not walk away with the title. Vickie Johnson started the rally with a 3-pointer to cut Houston's lead to 44-38. The Liberty then switched strategies for the next few possessions and worked hard at passing inside to Phillips, who scored two quick baskets.</p>
        <p>Still, the Comets held on, keeping the lead at 6 points with Cooper hitting a jumper and sinking two free throws. The Liberty then went on a 7-0 run for a 49-48 lead with 6:20 to go in regulation.</p>
