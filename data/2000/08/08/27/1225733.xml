        <p>WHEN it comes to waiting periods for benefits, experts say, companies often have more flexibility than they let on, and job candidates have more leverage than they might think.</p>
        <p>The best time to find out about waiting periods is when benefit details are discussed during the interview process. A simple expression of interest in a waiver may be all that is needed to get one. A waiver could also become a bargaining point in larger negotiations over employment terms.</p>
        <p>Experts say the odds of having an employer waive a waiting period are greatest for noncash benefits like vacation time or for savings programs like 401(k) plans, in which the money is mainly the employee's. Benefits that impose direct costs on employers, like profit-sharing or medical insurance, are harder to accelerate.</p>
        <p>Prospective employees can also improve their odds by knowing what the company's competition is offering, especially if they work in fields like technology, where many employers feel that they must be ready to match or outbid rivals.</p>
        <p>Still, job candidates should be realistic about what a company can do. The Carlson Companies, the hotel, restaurant and marketing company based in Minneapolis, has reduced the eligibility periods for medical and dental benefits from 90 days to 30 and will soon cut the waiting period for its 401(k) plan from 90 days to 60 -- but no further.  ''The vast majority of turnover occurs during the first 90 days, and especially during the first 30 days,'' said Charles Montreuil, the company's benefits director. Enrolling new workers before the company knows which ones will fall away and which will stay on would be prohibitively expensive, he said.</p>
