        <p>Summer pleasures is the theme of an exhibition organized by the Schoolhouse Gallery in Croton Falls, which has been installed in the conference and meeting rooms of the Southampton Inn on Long Island.</p>
        <p>Many works by the 22 featured artists depart from this overall focus, however. Elizabeth Strauss, for example, uses a cup motif as a vessel to contain musings and flights of fancy. Her intriguing stitched collages, notably ''Dream Cup,'' with its reference to a Breughel pastorale, imagines a sleeper reviewing shopping lists, to-do notes and other ephemera of daily life, patched together like scraps of memory.</p>

        <p>Summer pleasures is the theme of an exhibition organized by the Schoolhouse Gallery in Croton Falls, which has been installed in the conference and meeting rooms of the Southampton Inn on Long Island.</p>
        <p>Many works by the 22 featured artists depart from this overall focus, however. Elizabeth Strauss, for example, uses a cup motif as a vessel to contain musings and flights of fancy. Her intriguing stitched collages, notably ''Dream Cup,'' with its reference to a Breughel pastorale, imagines a sleeper reviewing shopping lists, to-do notes and other ephemera of daily life, patched together like scraps of memory.</p>
        <p>Ann Watkins's exquisite watercolors of dogs capture the animals' character in just a few deft strokes of color, while her tiny paintings of skies and fields are similarly reductive yet filled with atmosphere.</p>
        <p>The beach in summer is the focus of Michael Patterson's watercolors, in which swimmers and sunbathers appear solid and earthbound in contrast to the translucent water and sand.</p>
        <p>His large oil, ''Turning Into the Wind,'' recalls both Marsden Hartley and Milton Avery in its abstracted approach to form, with every element, from solid bodies to floating clouds, seeming equally massive and schematic.</p>
        <p>In a series of collaged woodcuts, Pam Smilow combines fragments of nature imagery with richly textured papers to create visual diaries of seashore experiences.</p>
