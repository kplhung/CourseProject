        <p>ANYONE stopping by the art exhibition at the Summit Bank corporate center here will never look at hubcaps the same again. Or paper.</p>
        <p>In the building's spacious lobby on Route 1, four New Jersey women are displaying works of handmade paper. In this medium the art isn't what is drawn or painted onto paper, but the paper itself.</p>
        <p>The four artists -- Anita Benarde, Marie Sturken and Margaret Kennard Johnson of Princeton and Joan B. Needham, an associate professor at Mercer Community College -- find plenty of possibilities in the seemingly humble form, whose pedigree goes back 2,000 years. At the door is Ms. Needham's ''Six Ceremonial Posts,'' pillars of hardened pulp that tower over visitors. There are minimalist framed works of white on white, works that mix in beads, bamboo, stitching, even rusted wire.</p>
        <p>''What we're trying to do is educate people on the possibilities of paper as art,'' said Ms. Bernard, who, like the other three artists, creates much of her work at the Dieu Donne Papermill in New York.</p>
        <p>In paper art, pulp is colored, pressed, molded and sometimes blown through a hose to create the image, whether a sculpture, a framed two-dimensional work or something in between. If paper remains underappreciated, it may be because it is easy to mistake it for something it isn't. ''There's no paint in that,'' Ms. Benarde said as she led a tour around the exhibition, pointing to a work that looked, well, like a painting. At another, she urged a close-up look at a bit of detail that could easily have been mistaken for a line of purple paint on white. ''See that?'' she said. ''That's one paper imbedded in another.''</p>
        <p>Also not evident to the casual viewer is that the process of creating works in paper is a long way from the genteel image of a landscape painter leisurely recording a sunset.</p>
        <p>''Long aprons, boots, that kind of thing,'' was how Ms. Benarde described what the women wear when they go into the studio to work in pulp, a messy and literally fluid medium. ''It's a wet situation.''</p>
        <p>The result can be as compelling as oil on canvas. It can also be whimsical, which is where the hubcaps come in. Among Ms. Benarde's works are four castings from a series in which she presses pulp into hubcaps, creating a sculpture not of the hubcap, but of its innards.</p>
        <p>''I was making my own molds, but then I decided I could try some found objects and I might get some interesting effects,'' she said. The ''Fiber Caps'' call to mind medieval armor, or giant versions of some ancient medallion.</p>
        <p>The molds, from a local hubcap dealer, come cheap. ''He was selling me all the rusted old ones that no one wanted, four for $1,'' she said.</p>
