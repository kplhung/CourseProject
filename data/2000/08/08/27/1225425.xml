        <p>GHOSTS OF THE TITANIC</p>
        <p>By Charles Pellegrino.</p>
        <p>Foreword by James Cameron.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 293 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>William Morrow. $26.</p>
        <p>If Charles Pellegrino weren't so shamelessly self-promoting, it might be O.K. to let this book drift into oblivion past the icebergs that it ought to hit. But he quotes himself in epigraphs, invents friendships with famous people and claims scientific authority for a work that flouts most principles of scientific scholarship. He shouldn't get away with it.</p>
        <p>Pellegrino's first book on this subject, ''Her Name, Titanic,'' was published in 1988. ''Ghosts of the Titanic'' covers similar ground -- the famous sinking and the discovery of its ruins -- but it is more ragged in the telling. Reading it is like being at a party of Titanic buffs in which conversations leap from Capt. Edward J. Smith's last words, to gunshots near the lifeboats, to digressions about Richard Nixon and leadership in America, with much posturing over who is most knowledgeable.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, some of the content sounds as if it was invented at the same party. To give the book authority, Pellegrino claims to be a scientific friend and colleague of Robert Ballard, who led the team that discovered the wreck in September 1985. But the close association the book implies is largely imaginary.</p>
        <p>In the very beginning of the book, Pellegrino describes a phone call from Ballard that sounds like an invitation to join the next Titanic expedition. Pellegrino claims that Ballard's call came because space robots Pellegrino and a friend had designed were like a ''deep ocean robot'' Ballard used to find the ship. ''One of them,'' Pellegrino writes, ''had just found the Titanic, and Bob had his next expedition already in mind. He wanted to know if I would be interested in joining him.''</p>
        <p>On the basis of this sentence, it seems obvious that Ballard wanted Pellegrino on the Titanic team. Pellegrino cements that idea as the book goes along.</p>
        <p>''I wondered if Ballard and I would ever find answers to any of the mysteries crowding around the Titanic's last three minutes,'' he writes in the following chapter. In 1986, the year of Ballard's second Titanic expedition, ''the field of deep-ocean archaeology was so new that we were its sole practitioners.'' Later: ''Bob Ballard had pointed out to me a crack in the starboard bow that ran for more than a hundred feet.''</p>
        <p>At the end of the book, like a witness who's forgotten the details of a story told long before, Pellegrino actually gives an impression that he was working with Ballard from the beginning of the search for the Titanic: ''the very absence of details as we started out in 1985 was exciting,'' he writes.</p>
        <p>All this is done so smoothly and so often that unless you know otherwise you soon visualize Pellegrino and Ballard standing together on a ship's bridge planning the next dive.</p>
        <p>But these impressions of shared exploration are misleading. When I checked with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and with Ballard, they confirmed that Pellegrino was on neither the 1985 expedition, when the Titanic was discovered not by a robot but by a towed imaging sled, nor on Ballard's follow-up trip to the Titanic in 1986. The expedition Ballard allowed Pellegrino to join, at Pellegrino's request, was a trip in the Pacific that was unrelated to the Titanic. In 1996 Pellegrino went to the Titanic site on an expedition, not connected with Ballard, run by a salvage organization called RMS Titanic. (On that expedition's arrival at the surface above the ship, Pellegrino writes: ''Moth to the flame. That's what you can call me. How else did I get here -- again?'' When I first read that I assumed, as most readers will, that he's referring back to a previous Ballard expedition. Only a second reading allows another interpretation: he may be suggesting that his previous life ended in the disaster.)</p>
        <p>The bottom line is that Pellegrino is not Ballard's colleague in exploration, and, with the exception of the single Pacific trip in 1985, Pellegrino has not worked with Ballard at all.</p>
        <p>This doesn't exactly help the credibility of the rest of the book, but Pellegrino undermines it in other ways, too. He repeatedly describes unlikely coincidences that relate him to the Titanic, apparently to claim that fate is also his friend. And too often he simply gets things wrong.</p>
        <p>For instance, a section about the Titanic's location begins with the authoritative-sounding statement: ''The Grand Banks are a cold wilderness, covered by two and one-half miles of sunless water.'' In fact, the Grand Banks are a system of reefs from 120 to 600 feet deep, northwest of where the Titanic lies in two and a half miles of water. Within a few sentences Pellegrino writes with equal authority of the abyssal plains -- the floor of the ocean -- as if that is also where the Titanic lies. In fact, the Titanic landed on the continental rise, a slope leading upward from the Sohm abyssal plain, which, in this area, is more than 15,000 feet down. On the same page, Pellegrino says that among the ''dominant conditions'' of the abyssal plains is the presence of life. In fact, those depths are noted for the relative scarcity of living things.</p>
        <p>An expert oceanographer should not have made these mistakes. But Pellegrino also claims to be an astrobiologist, a paleontologist, an archaeologist and a designer of space probes. Perhaps all these skills are just out of synch -- when he's working as an oceanographer, for instance, maybe he's thinking like a spaceman.</p>
        <p>''Ghosts of the Titanic'' contains various speculations in which Pellegrino works as a historian but seems to think like a circus barker. These include a fanciful idea that the forward grand stairway blasted almost intact out of the Titanic (like a space probe?) as the ship sank, to form a weird life raft that rode ''a full story out of the water.'' Pellegrino builds this flimsy idea into a wild assertion that survivors were on this staircase-lifeboat but that rescuers didn't look for it.</p>
        <p>These ideas are tacked together by breathless fictionalized anecdotes. Pellegrino, who does not provide specific citations, nevertheless defends the anecdotes as historically accurate. In a section called ''Acknowledgments, Notes and Selected Sources'' and in an Amazon.com defense of similar work in ''Her Name, Titanic,'' he says that his imagined scenes are based on correspondence in what he calls the ''Lord/Pellegrino files,'' referring to Walter Lord, the well-known author of ''A Night to Remember.'' Though Pellegrino again draws a mantle of someone else's respectability around his own shoulders, it doesn't work. He certainly can't claim historical accuracy for the many times he puts thoughts into the heads of people who died in that terrible night, or for some unlikely dialogue. In one scene he even has a survivor modify a familiar Billy Crystal line. When informed that the ship may break in half, the survivor says, ''Don't you just hate when that happens?''</p>
        <p>Pellegrino has an agile mind, which has carried him through books on Atlantis, Sodom and Gomorrah and the lunar module. What's sad about all this is that if he hadn't claimed authority that isn't his, had checked his facts more carefully and had more honestly labeled his reconstructions and speculations as imaginative, the book might have had promise. Unfortunately, he chose wrongly. His book reminds me of those that promote conspiracy theories or perpetual-motion machines, books full of detail and scientific-sounding authority that collapse when you look for foundations. ''Ghosts of the Titanic'' should sink to the abyssal plains.</p>
