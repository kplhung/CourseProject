        <p>Saying ''the world needs Nigeria to succeed,'' President Clinton arrived here today on a visit intended to nudge Africa's most populous country along in its shaky transition to civilian rule after 16 years of debilitating dictatorship.</p>
        <p>Upon his arrival, Mr. Clinton met with President Olusegun Obasanjo, a former general who was elected 15 months ago in a democratic transition begun after the death of the country's longtime military ruler, Sani Abacha. It was the first visit by an American president to Nigeria since Jimmy Carter arrived here in 1978.</p>
        <p>In his lengthy tour of Africa two years ago, Mr. Clinton pointedly bypassed Nigeria, a clear snub to the generals whose callous leadership had made the West African nation of some 114 million people an international pariah and led it perilously close to collapse.</p>
        <p>This time, Nigeria is the focus of a four-day, three-nation tour by the president as he tries to encourage the daunting transformation of an important oil producer and regional power that is troubled by volatile ethnic and religious divisions.</p>
        <p>After an elaborate airport arrival ceremony that featured song and dance, and a private meeting at the presidential villa with Mr. Obasanjo, Mr. Clinton addressed the National Assembly, a legislative body that was created last year shortly after Mr. Obasanjo won election and which has clashed with him ever since.</p>
        <p>''I begin this visit with enormous admiration for the progress you have made and the highest hopes for the progress you will make in the future,'' Mr. Clinton said after meeting with Mr. Obasanjo, who stood by his side.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton called it a ''high honor to visit the new Nigeria and to pledge America's support to the most important democratic transition in Africa since the fall of apartheid.''</p>
        <p>In their brief appearance before reporters -- Mr. Clinton wearing a dark suit with a bright red tie and Mr. Obasanjo wearing the customary Nigerian flowing robe called an agbada in sky blue -- the two men touched on the major priorities of the visit: regional peacekeeping, the fight against the AIDS epidemic that has ravaged Africa, the diamond smuggling that has fueled the continent's many wars, and the economics of oil.</p>
        <p>In his initial meeting with Mr. Obasanjo, the president encouraged Nigeria to do what it could to press other oil producers to increase production and cut prices. Nigeria, a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, is the sixth-largest supplier to the United States, providing about 8 percent of America's imported oil.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Obasanjo said he would push for lower, or at least more stable, oil prices when he attends a summit meeting of the 10 OPEC heads of government next month. ''We will work to bring an element of stability to the price of oil,'' Mr. Obasanjo said. ''It is in the interest of all concerned.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton intends to announce a series of new aid packages for Nigeria, mostly for primary education and disease prevention, that would add about $20 million to the $108 million that the United States currently provides.</p>
        <p>He also gave the Nigerians encouraging words when it came to relief from the country's $32 billion debt burden. The president said he would urge European countries to reschedule their loans with Nigeria, and would push to include Nigeria in a program for debt forgiveness sometime in the future, if the country stays on the path of reform.</p>
        <p>In addition, Mr. Clinton stressed the critical role Nigeria has played as a peacekeeper on the continent, which has been bled by a broad swath of conflict stretching from Sierra Leone in the west, to Congo at its center, to the Horn of Africa in the east.</p>
        <p>Nigeria has spent $10 billion on peacekeeping over the last decade in more than two dozen missions, American officials said. But its military has a poor record on human rights that includes summary executions of rebels and rebel supporters.</p>
        <p>Timed to coincide with the president's trip, the United States this week began training the first of five battalions of Nigerian soldiers for peacekeeping duties in nearby Sierra Leone, where 11 British soldiers sent as part of a force to help restore order after civil war reignited in May were reportedly abducted today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Obasanjo, meanwhile, said Nigeria has offered to play host to next year's global meeting on AIDS, an issue of primary importance across the continent. In Africa, where AIDS has lowered life expectancies and undermined economies, 24 million people are estimated to have the disease or the virus that causes it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's visit is intended to encourage Nigerians to stick with democracy in the face of these and other difficulties: poverty, endemic corruption and ethnic strife in a nation that Samuel R. Berger, the president's national security adviser, called the ''poorest oil-rich country in the world.''</p>
        <p>Despite these challenges, Nigeria remains one of the continent's wealthiest states and the economic and political powerhouse of its region. With one quarter of the population of all of sub-Saharan Africa and significant oil resources, the country is viewed by the United States as a potentially stabilizing force in Africa, where the ''renaissance'' that Mr. Clinton hailed on his last visit two years ago has all but withered elsewhere.</p>
        <p>''This is a make-or-break transition, not just for Nigeria, but for Africa,'' Mr. Berger told reporters before the trip began. ''If Nigeria succeeds, this can help lift the whole region to prosperity and peace. If it fails, it can swamp the whole region in turmoil and misery.''</p>
        <p>The two presidents also plan to discuss how to improve Nigeria's notoriously corrupt and inefficient oil production system, which sends millions of barrels to the United States and other countries but cannot seem to supply its own local gas stations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Obasanjo has himself undergone something of a transformation in his years in Nigerian political life. A former general, he once headed a military government after General Murtala Muhammad was assassinated in 1976. But he handed over power to a civilian president in 1979, and spoke out so vocally against corruption and military rule that General Abacha later jailed him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton gently encouraged Mr. Obasanjo to continue the political reforms he has started over the past year. In speaking before the legislature today, the president urged cooperation toward that end from all of the country's political players.</p>
        <p>''In the constitutional system, the legislature provides a check and balance to the executive,'' Mr. Clinton told a joint session of the Assembly, remarks that caused lawmakers frustrated by Mr. Obasanjo's governance to jump from their seats in applause.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Clinton also encouraged the members of the House and Senate to ''be a source of creative, responsible leadership.''</p>
        <p>''I know that decades of misrule and deprivation have made your religious and ethnic divisions deeper,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''But that is no reason to let the idea of one united Nigeria slip away.</p>
        <p>''The world needs Nigeria to succeed.''</p>
        <p>His audience was clearly enthused.</p>
        <p>Later, at a state dinner of pepper soup and beef tournedos, Mr. Obasanjo gave Mr. Clinton three Nigerian names, one for each of the country's three major ethnic groups, and he changed the name of the main roadway leading from the airport to President Clinton Drive. But the Nigerian president also made an additional, spirited pitch for debt forgiveness.</p>
        <p>''There's no light at the end of the tunnel,'' he said. Without forgiveness, ''we shall perpetually remain in debt.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton responded by saying, ''I will do my best to help Nigeria succeed economically.''</p>
        <p>Outside of Abuja, Nigeria's spiffy new capital, Mr. Clinton will see little else of the country. The president will venture out only once during his two-day stay, to a village several miles away that was being buffed and polished for his visit on Sunday.</p>
        <p>From Nigeria, Mr. Clinton heads to Tanzania, where he will lend his support to the efforts of Nelson Mandela, the former South African president, to broker a peace agreement between warring ethnic groups in Burundi. Mr. Mandela met with negotiators today as they tried to reach at least a partial accord before Mr. Clinton's arrival on Monday. But talks reportedly remained at an impasse.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton winds up his trip early Tuesday morning with a two-hour stop in Cairo, added to the schedule to allow the president to discuss the Middle East peace talks with Egypt's president, Hosni Mubarak.</p>
