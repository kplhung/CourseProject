        <p>GAIL DUFFY beamed as her students, clad in an eclectic assortment of costumes, performed lively skits about outer space that conveyed facts about different planets.</p>
        <p>''This is very hands-on,'' Ms. Duffy said. ''Kids need a lot of motivation. They're having a blast, but they're also doing reading and writing every night, and doing research. The tangible project is helping them with the material.''</p>
        <p>What would be an unremarkable sight during the school year was slightly jarring in midsummer. In fact, whether here at the Church Street School, the district's Eastview School, or in other schools around the county, it hardly seemed as if school was really out of session.</p>
        <p>There were the big yellow school buses rolling into Eastview before 9 a.m. to discharge their young passengers for a morning of academic sessions, where the building's lower floor was filled with kindergartners, first and second graders, while the upper floors were a focused hub of activity for middle-school students reviewing math and English.</p>
        <p>This is summer school in its latest incarnation, a far cry from the punitive, repetitive, drill-oriented approach that parents may recall.</p>
        <p>Granted, there have always been students who see summer as an opportunity to pursue a particular passion, whether advanced computer classes, the arts or an enrichment class in writing, science or math.</p>
        <p>And granted, too, summer school has been there for high school students who failed classes or their Regents exams and needed to make up the work.</p>
        <p>What makes things different now is the pressure of high-stakes reading tests in the lower grades. Nor is New York State alone. At least 25 percent of the schools in the United States require summer school for students who are having academic difficulties.</p>
        <p>In New York, summer school is not mandatory, but passing the high-stakes tests is, and one solution for some districts is to recommend summer school for  younger and younger students.</p>
        <p>Last summer, for example, 406 of more than 719 school districts in the state offered some form of summer school, according to the state. Locally, 16 of 18 Putnam/Northern Westchester districts are offering summer school programs.</p>
        <p>''We've always had summer school,'' said Dr. Constance Iervolino, assistant superintendent for curriculum in White Plains. ''In 1998, there were 100 elementary school students for grades 2 through 4. Now we have 340 students in grades 1 through 5, and 17 classes. The state is strongly encouraging summer school, and we strongly recommend it for some students. There's a definite increase in skills.''</p>
        <p>She added: ''We want them to be stronger in September. The material is different, and they're doing more hands-on science and math.''</p>
        <p>In Elmsford, a smaller district with a significant Hispanic population, the expansion of summer school was a result of disappointing results on state exams. It is seen as an important factor in improving student performance on state tests.</p>
        <p>''We started with a small reading program four years ago for kids at risk,'' said Robert Cancellaro, assistant superintendent in Elmsford, where more than 80 students are enrolled in the elementary summer school program, and 45 are enrolled in the seventh-  and eighth-grade program. The district pays the entire $34,000 bill.</p>
        <p>''This has all to do with the standards; we didn't do this before the standards,'' he said. ''Our first English language arts test result wasn't what we had wanted. These are good tests. If you're teaching these skills, you will be teaching good things.''</p>
        <p>Gail Epstein, director of the White Plains school district program at the Church Street school, added: ''Increasing summer enrollment definitely has to do with the higher standards. We have the luxury during the summer of having a teacher, teacher's assistant and college students helping, so the ratio helps in instruction. There's very little blackboard work. The kids are happy to be here.''</p>
        <p>And unlike their city counterparts, who have been facing significant absentee rates, here the absentee rate is only 5 to 7 percent.</p>
        <p>In Yonkers, where summer school eligibility was restricted to students in grades 8, 11 and 12 who had failed one course, the average absentee rate was only 10 to 15 percent.</p>
        <p>Perhaps that is because of the approach taken in many of the county's summer schools, where teachers try to present material that was covered during the school year in a different way.</p>
        <p>''The space theme is cool,'' said Jonathan Regis, a sixth grader, explaining his sand-and-rock shoe box, which was meant to mimic the surface of Mars. ''We're doing more activities than during regular school.''</p>
        <p>Cary Smith, principal of the White Plains summer school, said: ''We're trying very hard to change the approach. It's six weeks. We're not trying to rehash the knowledge they have but finding out where they are and reconfirming it. We're taking more time and trying to individualize the instruction.''</p>
        <p>Class sizes are 22 to 23 students, he added, and students are grouped by ability to manage the material.</p>
