        <p>Welcome to my Planet</p>
        <p>Where English Is Sometimes Spoken.</p>
        <p>By Shannon Olson.</p>
        <p>Viking, $22.95.</p>
        <p>The narrator of this book is the epitome of the 30-ish post-slacker: she's got a job she doesn't like, a boyfriend she doesn't love, a therapist who's too hard on her and a mother who was never hard enough. Shannon Olson (who has the same name as her narrator) never ventures far from the ''single gal tells all'' territory explored by Helen Fielding and Melissa Bank -- her protagonist lacks the former's sense of drama and the latter's easy wit -- though she does a singular job of portraying the terror of never knowing what to ask from life. When her mother's illness brings out new tensions in her parents' marriage, Shannon finds she prefers the distraction of shopping and watching television to real life -- and then wonders why she doesn't find fulfillment in new lipstick. ''Women's magazines did this to me,'' she says. ''Watching 'Love Boat' did this. I did this to myself.'' Olson's writing is honest and pleasantly unassuming. If Shannon's despondency seems to preclude anything profound from happening, it's because her own sense of alienation is all too palpable.</p>
