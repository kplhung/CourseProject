        <p>The Amtrak Auto Train, which carries automobiles and passengers between the Washington area and the Orlando area, has opened a new station at its northern terminal, in Lorton, Va. Its platform is now long enough to accommodate the entire train rather than half, which was the case previously, and is expected to reduce the time needed by Auto Train staff to unload vehicles. New waiting areas with 450 seats, food service and bigger restrooms are also part of the building.</p>
        <p>The Auto Train operates once a day in each direction, leaving Lorton and Sanford, Fla., at 4 p.m. and arriving at 8:30 a.m. the next day. Lorton is 25 miles south of the capital; Sanford is on the outskirts of Orlando. Each train can handle about 270 vehicles and has 16 cars for passengers, including three dining cars. The fare for the 855-mile trip includes a dinner and Continental breakfast; sleeping car berths cost extra.</p>
