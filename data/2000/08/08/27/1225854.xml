        <p>The mea culpas began almost as soon as Norwegian divers pried open the hatch of the Russian nuclear submarine Kursk, which went down in 350 feet of water during exercises in the Barents Sea on Aug. 12, killing all 118 people on board. The commanders of the navy offered to resign, as did the defense minister, Igor D. Sergeyev, but Russia's commander in chief, Vladimir V. Putin, declined to accept the resignations.</p>
        <p>Russian officials said they suspected that the Kursk was sunk after striking a submerged object of ''large tonnage,'' like a foreign submarine, and they were busy scouring the seabed for evidence. But the main task facing Mr. Putin is quieting the political storm over the navy's ill-equipped and inept rescue operation.</p>
