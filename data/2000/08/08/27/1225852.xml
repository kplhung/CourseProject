        <p>For the third time, Attorney General Janet Reno brushed off the advice of senior advisers and declined to intensify an investigation into Vice President Al Gore's fundraising activities in 1996.</p>
        <p>She said she would not appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Mr. Gore's sworn statements that neither his appearance at a Buddhist temple in California in 1986 nor his attendance at several White House coffee sessions were fundraisers. Law-enforcement officials said Ms. Reno's decision meant that Mr. Gore would finally be free and clear of any criminal liability as he goes into the final months of the presidential campaign.</p>
