        <p>Mutual fund investors are typically warned not to follow the ''hot hands'' -- that is, to chase recent outstanding performance with frequent trades. The better strategy, they are told, is to buy fund shares and hold them long term. But a recent study turns that advice on its head.</p>
        <p>Thomas J. Zwirlein and Venkateshwar K. Reddy, associate professors of finance at the University of Colorado in Colorado Springs, concluded that a follow-the-winner approach works better than a buy-and-hold approach in I.R.A.'s, 401(k) plans and other tax-favored accounts.

        <p>Mutual fund investors are typically warned not to follow the ''hot hands'' -- that is, to chase recent outstanding performance with frequent trades. The better strategy, they are told, is to buy fund shares and hold them long term. But a recent study turns that advice on its head.</p>
        <p>Thomas J. Zwirlein and Venkateshwar K. Reddy, associate professors of finance at the University of Colorado in Colorado Springs, concluded that a follow-the-winner approach works better than a buy-and-hold approach in I.R.A.'s, 401(k) plans and other tax-favored accounts. The study was published in the August 2000 issue of the Journal of Financial Planning.</p>
        <p>The study, which used Morningstar data covering January 1977 to December 1992, simulated investing $600 monthly in one or more of six types of mutual funds: aggressive growth, growth, growth and income, small company, international and balanced.</p>
        <p>In the study, the researchers compared the returns and risk for three investing strategies. The first was a buy-and-hold approach, in which they put $100 into each type of fund every month. The second was the low-cost method -- investing the entire $600 in the poorest-performing category, as some investors do to get more shares. The third was a hot-hands strategy, in which they put the $600 into the best-performing category, along with the  entire amount already invested; the portfolio was updated quarterly.</p>
        <p>The ''hot hands'' brought the 15-year total to $489,023, compared with $345,838 for the buy-and-hold approach and $320,335 for the low-cost method.</p>
        <p>The hot-hands strategy has higher risk, the authors noted, and may not be suitable for all investors. Moreover, it works best in tax-deferred accounts because the frequent trades could result in taxable gains in a regular account.</p>
