        <p>Anika Evelyn Davis, an administrator at New York University, and Eliot Forson Pratt, an investment banker, were married last evening in Palo Alto, Calif. James W. Stewart, a retired judge of the Santa Clara County Superior Court in San Jose, Calif., officiated at the First Baptist Church of Palo Alto.</p>
        <p>The bride, 29, received a master's degree in education administration from N.Y.U., where she is now an associate director of M.B.A. admissions at the Stern School of Business. She is the daughter of Margo Davis of Palo Alto and N. Gregson G. Davis of Chapel Hill, N.C., and the stepdaughter of Anthony L. Browne and of Daphne L. Davis. The bride's father is the chairman of the department of classical studies and the Andrew W. Mellon distinguished professor in the humanities at Duke University. Her mother is a fine arts photographer in Palo Alto. The bride's stepfather is the chief financial officer of Agorics Inc., a Los Altos, Calif., company that makes software to allow secure financial interactions over the Internet.</p>
        <p>The bridegroom, also 29, is the vice president of Ampton Investments, a banking firm in New York. He is a son of Helen F. Pratt and Charles M. Pratt of New York. The bridegroom's mother owns a literary agency bearing her name in New York. His father is a partner in the New York law firm of Dickstein Shapiro Morin &amp; Oshinsky.</p>
        <p>Although the couple had known each other through mutual friends at Harvard University, from which Ms. Davis graduated in 1993 and Mr. Pratt in 1994, they did not become friends until a short while later, when both were living in New York. Mr. Pratt had gone to visit a male friend from college, and one of the friend's roommates happened to be Ms. Davis. Over the following months, Ms. Davis and Mr. Pratt became good platonic pals, and part of a close-knit circle of friends who dined together regularly. Before long, Mr. Pratt's affection for Ms. Davis became increasingly romantic, but he feared asking her out on a date because he didn't want to risk disturbing the social ecology of the group, if the anticipated romance didn't work out.</p>
        <p>In the summer of 1998, Mr. Pratt decided to take a chance and asked if she would like to get together with him and several of their friends at a restaurant. The thing was, this time he didn't invite the other friends.</p>
        <p>Ms. Davis and Mr. Pratt arrived more or less simultaneously at the small, crowded SoHo restaurant. The two chatted as usual as they waited 20 minutes for a table. Every once in a while, Ms. Davis would wonder aloud where their friends were. Mr. Pratt would answer vaguely and change the subject. Because all of the tables were the same size and could accommodate up to five people, Ms. Davis's suspicions were not aroused when they were finally seated.</p>
        <p>''I said, 'Looks like everyone else has canceled,' '' Mr. Pratt said.</p>
        <p>While Ms. Davis thought this an odd coincidence, she didn't puzzle over it. ''I forgot about it quickly,'' she recalled. ''We were having a really good time.'' By the end of the meal, she had begun to suspect that Mr. Pratt wanted to shift the register of their relationship, but she couldn't be absolutely sure.</p>
        <p>''I didn't declare; there was no ultimatum, no outpouring of emotion,'' Mr. Pratt said. ''I just flirted a little.''</p>
        <p>The couple left the restaurant for an East Village bar. As they walked, the picture became clearer. Mr. Pratt suddenly got on his cell phone and began rounding up the same group of friends that were supposed to have met them at the restaurant, this time to meet them for a drink. It was then that Ms. Davis felt she knew with certainty that Mr. Pratt ''was interested.''</p>
        <p>''I thought to myself, 'I think this could work,' '' she said.</p>
