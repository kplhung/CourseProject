        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The New York Times has offered to print a ''brief response'' to the article by Shostakovich's widow, Irina Shostakovich [''An Answer to Those Who Still Abuse Shostakovich,'' Aug. 20], in which she challenges the veracity of the book ''Testimony: The Memoirs of Dmitri Shostakovich,'' which I wrote with the composer. So I will be brief.</p>
        <p>Ms. Shostakovich's allegations about my supposedly short relationship with the composer, the limited number of meetings while working on his memoirs, the matter of his signatures and the like are all old hat. They were first aired in 1979 by the K.G.B. general in charge of disinformation, Vasily Sitnikov, in an attempt to discredit the Shostakovich memoirs, then just published.</p>
        <p>Two photographs of me with the composer visually refute Ms. Shostakovich's claim that Shostakovich ''knew little about'' me, since they cover a nine-year span. In fact, none of the published pictures of me with the composer were made by my wife, as Ms. Shostakovich claims.</p>
        <p>The purpose of her current attack, which first appeared in the English-language edition of The Moscow News, apparently remains the same. This, sadly, tells a lot about the situation in contemporary Russia.</p>
