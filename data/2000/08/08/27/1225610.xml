        <p>Ms. Rezneck, 25, is keeping her name. Until last month, she was a special assistant in the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency, which administers parole, probation and other criminal justice services for the District of Columbia. She graduated magna cum laude from Harvard, as did her husband, and is to begin studying next month for a law degree at Stanford, where her husband received his law degree.</p>
        <p>The bride's father, who retired as a partner in the Washington law firm of Arnold &amp; Porter, is the general counsel to the Washington Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority, which has overseen the District's finances since its fiscal difficulties in 1995. He is also a director of the Brennan Center for Justice, a research institute at New York University. Her mother is a freelance photographer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ehrlich, 34, was until Thursday a trial attorney in the Justice Department's public integrity section in Washington, which investigates and prosecutes public corruption. Next month he is to become an assistant United States attorney in San Francisco. In 1993 and 1994, he was a law clerk to Associate Justice Anthony M. Kennedy of the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>The bridegroom's mother is a travel agent in Sacramento. His father, who is retired, was a urologist in El Paso.</p>
