        <p>Just when Omar Stoutmire thought he had returned as the Jets' starting free safety, he was dealt the severest football blow of all -- he was cut today.</p>
        <p>That was the most surprising move of the 10 players Coach Al Groh dropped today in paring the roster to 53. Stoutmire had started two of the four preseason games, including the finale against the Giants. He was also the incumbent starter.</p>
        <p>And this year's starter is? Most likely, it will be Scott Frost, but Kevin Williams said today that he had rotated with Frost at this morning's practice as the Jets' bye week ended.</p>
        <p>There is a certain symmetry to all of this. In 1998, Frost and Williams were rookies, both picked on the third round. Williams won out as the starter, only to be benched. Since then, the Jets have used four other starters at free safety.</p>
        <p>This appears to be Frost's moment, though. He has taken to heart Groh's advice when camp started. Groh told him, ''Every day you walk in here, think, 'Why not me?' ''</p>
        <p>Frost was the quarterback of Nebraska's co-national championship college team in 1997, but he was drafted into the pros as a safety. Bill Parcells liked his size, 6 feet 3 inches and 219 pounds. He had battled Stoutmire and Williams at free safety all summer. Williams is faster than Frost, but 3 inches shorter and about 25 pounds lighter.</p>
        <p>Groh also cut Yatil Green, the former Dolphins first-round choice, whose injury-plagued career made him expendable in Miami but an inexpensive pickup for the Jets. Until late in training camp, though, Green showed little, and his number was up when the Jets landed another free-agent receiver, Vincent Brisby. He will be the third receiver behind Wayne Chrebet and Dedric Ward.</p>
        <p>The others cut were quarterback Jim Kubiak, running back Vaughn Sanders, centers Mike Gisler and Keith Short, center/long snapper Dennis O'Sullivan, offensive tackle Jeff Pilon, defensive end Anthony Cook and defensive tackle Jon Michaels.</p>
        <p>The only long snapper on the club now is Kevin Maewe, who has told coaches he prefers to devote full time to playing center. The Jets could be interested in the former snapper John Hudson or perhaps a player cut by another team.</p>
        <p>Groh said that Frost had progressed.</p>
        <p>''I guess the Frost has thawed,'' said Groh, who likes to speak in metaphors. ''He's come a long way. He was resolute in his efforts. A very aggressive tackler. He had to find out coming in as a quarterback -- one, how to tackle, and, two, it didn't hurt.''</p>
        <p>Then Groh paused for effect and added, ''All the time.''</p>
        <p>Groh said he had not formally named Frost as his starter. Both Williams and Frost said they hoped to learn soon. But there is only a week left before the regular season begins next Sunday at Green Bay.</p>
        <p>Williams proclaimed himself totally recovered from the serious heart and lung infection that hospitalized him last season, led him to drop to 158 pounds from 193, and put him in a life-threatening situation.</p>
        <p>''I just know there's not a lot of people who would have made it back,'' Williams said.</p>
        <p>And Frost described the merry-go-round free safety situation as ''a bit of a mess'' since he has been a Jet. He even admitted that when he tried to make the transition, ''I felt like a fish out of water.''</p>
        <p>But he said he feels confident now about his tackling. Williams said he feels good about being healthy again. In a sense, both Williams and Frost have had to re-learn who they are as football players.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Coach AL GROH said that a tough Friday practice had confirmed the wisdom of his brutal summer workouts. ''If you want a tough-minded team, you pick tough-minded guys,'' he said. ''There was a particular type of practice I was looking for Friday at the end of the bye week. There was no competitive reason to respond, but they responded just for the sake of responding. I think they came up with their highest tempo, most spirited practice of the week.''</p>
