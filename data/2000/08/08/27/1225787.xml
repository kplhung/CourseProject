        <p>JOE GARDI calls his Hofstra University football team the Road Warriors, meaning, they will go just about anywhere for a game.</p>
        <p>They have no choice. In this age of sprawling leagues, proliferating conferences, made-for-TV affiliations, new best friends with instant traditions, Hofstra goes it alone.</p>
        <p>The solo act is fine if you're Notre Dame and can hire your own television network, and play anybody you want. It doesn't work that way for a school on Long Island with little drawing power and a potent run-and-gun offense.</p>
        <p>Nobody wants to be locked in with a Division I-AA powerhouse that is sending more players to the National Football League than some of the traditional schools that grab the prime time and the headlines.</p>
        <p>Hofstra has sent Wayne Chrebet to the Jets' bunker on the fringe of the campus. Earlier this month, Gardi went out to the Hall of Fame Game in Ohio to have his photo taken with four of his players currently with the San Francisco 49ers: Dave Fiore, Lance Schulters, Jim Emanuel and last year's all-American, Giovanni Carmazzi, the third quarterback picked in the N.F.L. draft.</p>
        <p>The photo is such an effective advertisement that hardly anybody wants to play the freelance kings of the Hempstead plains.</p>
        <p>Check out this schedule -- at Montana this Saturday, forest fires or not; then go to Maine; two home games against Delaware and Rhode Island; then go to Massachusetts; a week later at Portland State in Oregon; two home games against Liberty and Elon; then Cal Poly at San Luis Obispo; a week later at Youngstown in Ohio. Then Albany at home. Then possibly three straight weeks of Division I-AA playoffs.</p>
        <p>That is one of the more eclectic schedules in the land. If you wrote the names of the opponents on a blackboard, you would be hard-pressed to deduce what they have in common. ''We're a victim of our success,'' said Gardi, who has won 81 games, lost 29 and tied 2.</p>
        <p>When Gardi arrived in 1990, the road trips were to Bucknell, Stony Brook, Gettysburg, Catholic and Wagner.</p>
        <p>''Flying Dutchmen Travel Itinerary,'' the media guide said: ''Team leaves via bus from the Hofstra Field House at 8:30 a.m. . . . will arrive at 10:30 a.m.'' Now that was a road trip.</p>
        <p>Two years later, Hofstra was playing Montana in the university town of Missoula.</p>
        <p>''Beautiful, gorgeous, spectacular,'' Gardi recalled. ''They filmed the movie 'A River Runs Through It' right around there. Great little stadium. Fifteen thousand people right on top of you. Screaming at you the whole game. One guy was right behind me. Finally I turned around and said to his wife, 'Ma'am, you're the one I feel sorry for.' ''</p>
        <p>Gardi just happens to remember the details of that game, how instead of felling logs and punching cattle the Montana players thumped on Hofstra.</p>
        <p>''Three of my guys went down on one play,'' Gardi recalled the other day. ''I ran out there and told them: 'Hey, this is embarrassing. Two of you better get up,' and two of 'em did, but the third guy was hurt worse than the others.''</p>
        <p>The final score was 50-6, and Gardi was concerned he might have led his troops over their heads. He still recalls one of his players, Herve Damas, consoling him.</p>
        <p>''Coach, don't worry about it,'' Damas said. ''We got our butts beat, but this is a lot better than Hempstead Turnpike'' -- meaning, better than local rivalries.</p>
        <p>Since then, Hofstra has roamed to the ends of the earth for games, meanwhile petitioning the traditional Eastern conferences for membership. Gardi would love to play nonleague games against his alma mater, Maryland, or Rutgers from his home state of New Jersey, but it's not happening.</p>
        <p>''People are not stupid,'' Gardi said. ''I've heard people say that as long as I'm here, Hofstra will never get in a conference.''</p>
        <p>He plans to be here a while. Gardi, 61, recently re-upped for five more years. ''I know guys in my business who retire,'' he said. ''Then they're calling and saying, 'Hey, can I come over and do anything?' ''</p>
        <p>He still revels in being called Coach. After his 10-year gig as defensive guru with the Jets went sour in 1985, Gardi worked five years monitoring officials for the N.F.L.</p>
        <p>''The train ride from Sayville took two hours,'' Gardi said. ''Other people read the paper or did crossword puzzles. I dreamed about coaching four hours a day. Even when I was watching films of the officials, I sneaked a peek at what the teams were doing.''</p>
        <p>He and Hofstra were matched in 1990. Gardi, from Maryland, and Dr. James Shuart, the Hofstra president and an alum, hit it off like the old linemen they are. Gardi promised Shuart he would take Hofstra far. Turned out he meant Missoula.</p>
