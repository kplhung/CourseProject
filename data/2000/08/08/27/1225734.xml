        <p>Somalis who speak little English will still giggle and say: ''Read my lips.'' Despite mixed feelings about Americans here, there is strong affection for the father -- as a man who tried to make peace in Somalia -- that has rubbed off on the son this American election year.</p>
        <p>''We are following it,'' said Shuayb Abdi Karim, 30. ''And we support Bush.'' Or ''Bush Junior,'' as George W. Bush is sometimes called here.</p>
        <p>Mr. Karim was standing in a spot that caused much pain for Somalis and Americans alike. An American Black Hawk helicopter was shot down there in October 1993, igniting an all-night battle in which 18 Americans and perhaps 500 Somalis died. Mr. Karim said his brother, who was 18, was killed by a stray bullet.</p>
        <p>That battle marked the beginning of the end for America's military involvement in Somalia, and in all of Africa for that matter, under the Clinton administration. So the logic behind the fervor for George W. Bush here is that he might have a personal stake in reversing that, since his father sent American troops here in the first place.</p>
        <p>''If the Republicans win, I think the Somali problem is over,'' said Abdi Sheikdon Negeye, 40, once one of Somalia's most popular radio personalities. ''All Somalis believe that. We lost Somalia when the Democrats came in power.''</p>
        <p>Americans do not have good memories of Somalia (just as there are many Somalis who feel American soldiers went too far in trying to create peace here). And Mr. Bush has given no sign of any plan for re-engaging in one of the most troubled corners of the world if he wins the White House.</p>
        <p>But that has not tamped down hope here. That hope is fueled partly by the memories of the money that flowed into Somalia during the United Nations operations here and softened the economic blow after the government of the dictator Muhammad Siad Barre -- and all central authority -- fell in 1991.</p>
        <p>A vein of optimism is also rising to the surface in Somalia that there finally may be a return of government, from peace talks going on now in the neighboring country of Djibouti. Many Somalis say it would not take much money -- donated perhaps by the United States -- to give any new government an early dose of legitimacy.</p>
        <p>Perhaps for those reasons, some Somalis are following American politics and this election very closely. Mr. Negeye, at a wedding in a well-guarded hotel in Mogadishu, was talking about how he views Republicans as far better on foreign policy than the Democrats. One Somali said he liked Mr. Bush because Gen. Colin Powell is also a Republican.</p>
        <p>At one of Mogadishu's beautiful beaches, Abdulahi Ahmed Koronto, 42, said he sees Mr. Bush as having stolen Bill Clinton's old game plan, positioning the Republicans to the center.</p>
        <p>''George Bush is a man who has taken policy from the Democrats,'' said Mr. Koronto, a programs officer for a foreign aid agency in better days who is now unemployed. ''He looks very compassionate. His father was not compassionate like him. He's very flexible, no?''</p>
        <p>And in a society where family counts above all, many Somalis say they feel they know the candidate from his father, starting from the familiar voice and face.</p>
        <p>''He looks very much like his father,'' said Muhammad Hassan Guled, 56, a former port manager who was holding the wedding for his son. ''And his father left him a big reputation. Now the world is expecting much from him.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush also has support from Somalia's most famous son, Hussein Aidid. His father, Gen. Muhammad Farah Aidid, was one of Mogadishu's most notorious warlords until his death in a street battle in 1996. The elder Mr. Aidid was, in fact, the man whom the American soldiers were trying to capture in October 1993, when the Black Hawk was downed.</p>
        <p>The younger Mr. Aidid, 38, who lived for 17 years in the United States and fought as a United States Marine in the Persian Gulf war, returned to Somalia to take over his father's faction. He was a registered Republican in California -- who voted both for Bush and for Clinton in various races, he said -- and he had some advice for the younger Mr. Bush: ''You can't be in his shoes. You have to have your own ideas.''</p>
        <p>The advice seemed heartfelt: Mr. Aidid has had much trouble of his own stepping out of the shadow of his father.</p>
