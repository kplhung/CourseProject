        <p>''Before and After the End of Time: Architecture and the Year 1000,'' an exhibition that was scheduled to open yesterday at the Fogg Museum at Harvard University, is an overview of Romanesque architecture, which preceded the Gothic cathedrals in Europe. Romanesque (meaning Roman-like) was a rediscovery of the masonry techniques of the Roman empire, characterized by rounded arches, domed vaults and cut-stone masonry that emphasize the power of mass, space and gravity, rather than the more ethereal vertical aspirations of the Gothic.</p>
        <p>Included in the exhibition are 12 gemstones representing the ones from which the foundations of the new Jerusalem of John's Book of Revelation were to be made; they present a striking contrast to the massive buildings of the Romanesque. The exhibition is punctuated with examples of expressive, humanistic 12th-century sculpture from France and Spain. And renderings by the Harvard art historian Kenneth J. Conant on the 11th century transformation of the Benedictine abbey at Cluny, France, are being shown to the public for the first time.</p>

        <p>''Before and After the End of Time: Architecture and the Year 1000,'' an exhibition that was scheduled to open yesterday at the Fogg Museum at Harvard University, is an overview of Romanesque architecture, which preceded the Gothic cathedrals in Europe. Romanesque (meaning Roman-like) was a rediscovery of the masonry techniques of the Roman empire, characterized by rounded arches, domed vaults and cut-stone masonry that emphasize the power of mass, space and gravity, rather than the more ethereal vertical aspirations of the Gothic.</p>
        <p>Included in the exhibition are 12 gemstones representing the ones from which the foundations of the new Jerusalem of John's Book of Revelation were to be made; they present a striking contrast to the massive buildings of the Romanesque. The exhibition is punctuated with examples of expressive, humanistic 12th-century sculpture from France and Spain. And renderings by the Harvard art historian Kenneth J. Conant on the 11th century transformation of the Benedictine abbey at Cluny, France, are being shown to the public for the first time.</p>
        <p>Rarely-seen architectural photography by the architect Henry Hobson Richardson, whose late 19th century Romanesque Revival style was particularly influential in the United States, is also on display.</p>
        <p>The exhibition will be at the Fogg Museum, 32 Quincy Street, Cambridge, Mass., through Jan. 21. The Fogg is open Monday through Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and Sunday 1 to 5 p.m.; closed holidays. Admission is $5; $4 for ages 61 and above; $3 for college students; free for children under 18 and for everyone on Wednesdays and Saturdays until noon; (617) 495-9400.</p>
