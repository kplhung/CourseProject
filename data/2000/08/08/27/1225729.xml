        <p>Robert F LaPorta letter, responding to Deborah Bachrach's Aug 24 letter that decried lack of health insurance for immigrants, says immigrants should not be a drain on taxpayers</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>An Aug. 24 letter decries the lack of health insurance for immigrants and points to ''the faces behind the changes in federal law that effectively deny Medicaid and State Child Health Insurance to most immigrants who entered the country after August 1996.''</p>
        <p>What is not stated is the reasoning behind that law. Each legal immigrant has a sponsor who has pledged to provide support for each immigrant for five years so as to not become a public charge. As the letter says, even with that, Medicaid still provides support for emergency situations.</p>

        <p>Immigration is a privilege, not a right. Sponsors should be held to their pledges. Immigrants should not be a drain on taxpayers.</p>
