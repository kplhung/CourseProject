        <p>Randy Cohen The Ethicist question-and-answer column answers questions on ethics of special-education teacher working on student's evaluation form while riding on a bus and ethics of leaving cart on supermarket checkout line while getting drink of water and confronting person who pushed it out of way (M)</p>

        <p>On the bus the other day, I glanced at the woman next to me. She was working on a special-education student's evaluation form, showing the child's name, the school's name and all of the child's problems and diagnoses. She should not have been doing confidential work in a public place. Should I call the school and tell them without mentioning the therapist's name or chalk it up to a momentary lapse in professional judgment? -- C. Cohen, Forest Hills, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Alas, I think the lapse is yours for the (admittedly minor) offense of snooping. A ''glance,'' as you call it, would not have revealed as much information as you took in. Give this poor, hard-working special-ed teacher a break; let her catch up on her work on the bus. It seems very unlikely that any misuse of the information could come from her fellow passengers. And with all due respect, for civil society to be possible, there are times when we each must mind our own business. (If, however, you'd like to do some glancing on that commuter spy bus that runs through Los Alamos, you might qualify for a part-time job with the F.B.I.)</p>

        <p>Standing in the supermarket checkout line, I left briefly to get a drink at the nearby fountain. When I returned, my cart had been pushed aside and my place had been taken. I said to the offending lady, ''I believe I was ahead of you.'' She replied, ''You left.'' I then proceeded to push her cart aside and tell her that I do not go for that garbage. What is your opinion? -- Scott Bodin, Suffern, N.Y.</p>
        <p>My opinion is that if you try this sort of thing with, say, a couple of burly guys at a junkyard instead of with a woman at a supermarket -- well, I hope your health insurance is paid up.</p>
        <p>This sounds more like a matter of social custom than ethics, and as I understand the folkways of the supermarket, that lady you bullied was in the right: unattended carts may be moved. It's not a bad rule; she had no idea how long you'd be gone or if you'd be back at all. Without it, shoppers would be tempted to reserve a place in line with a half-filled cart while they strolled through the produce department, inconveniencing all.</p>
        <p>While that woman would have been generous to let you back in line, she was not obliged to. And if everyone responds to such small slights as belligerently as you did, picking up a little broccoli will become a lot riskier -- and the inspiration for a Jean-Claude Van Damme movie.</p>
