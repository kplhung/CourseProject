        <p>Kai Penn had always thought about becoming an actress, model and singer, but the sixth grader says her career aspirations will probably change now that she is a student at the Young Women's Leadership Charter School here.</p>
        <p>''I go on the Internet a lot,'' said Kai, 11, on her first day at the South Side school. ''It was my dad's idea for me to go here. It's pretty cool. Maybe I'll be a tech person now.''</p>
        <p>Kai, 74 other sixth graders and 75 ninth-grade girls are the first students to enroll in what is Chicago's first all-girls public school, and one of the few public all-girls schools in the nation.</p>
        <p>Such schools have existed in Philadelphia and Baltimore for 150 years. But their curriculums have been more traditional. The new school here is one of the few girls schools, public or private, to focus primarily on math, science and technology.</p>
        <p>The founders of the school, a sister to the Young Women's Leadership Academy in Harlem, which opened in 1996, say it will free the girls from what many find to be an intimidating presence of boys in classes.</p>
        <p>But it comes at a time when many are questioning the value of an all-girls educational experience.</p>
        <p>A 1998 study by the American Association of University Women showed no proof that a single-sex educational environment is more beneficial to girls than a coed environment. The report found that while many girls prefer a single-sex atmosphere, they may not excel academically when they are separated from boys.</p>
        <p>''We've found these schools are not a cure-all,'' said Pamela Haag, research director at the American Association of University Women. ''The bottom line is that separating students by sex alone is not going to be a solution. More than anything, there are just basic characteristics that need to be in place for a school to be good.''</p>
        <p>But directors of the charter school here, which they expect to include grades 6 through 12 in the coming years, say the school fulfills a particular need among inner-city girls, many of whom would otherwise never consider careers in technology.</p>
        <p>''This is a college prep curriculum because these girls are going to college,'' said Jeanne Nowaczewski, one of a group of 20 professional Chicago women who championed the school after recognizing the dearth of such programs for disadvantaged girls.</p>
        <p>''We asked for the right to take the poorest kids available and educate them for $5,023 per kid, as opposed to a private school that charges $11,000 tuition,'' said Ms. Nowaczewski, a  lawyer who serves school's board. ''We did it because when we talked to teachers, they said they wished they'd been able to catch those students early.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, 73 percent of the students here are African-American; the majority of the students come from nearby communities on the South Side. About 75 to 80 percent of the girls are poor enough to qualify for the free lunch program. Students are selected by lottery and there is already a waiting list for next year.</p>
        <p>The school is purposefully located on the campus of the Illinois Institute of Technology, which produces many computer-science majors.</p>
        <p>The curriculum includes seven rigorous years of math, science and computer courses, and courses are designed to make the girls attractive to colleges and future employers. In addition to the heavy emphasis on science and technology, students spend Wednesday afternoons volunteering in nursing homes and eventually, as they get older, at internships with Chicago companies.</p>
        <p>The curriculum is, by necessity, somewhat light on physical education and the humanities; in fact, English and social studies are lumped into one course.</p>
        <p>Cynthia Nambo, a sixth-grade science teacher who is herself a product of an all-girls, Catholic education, said she had not seen the benefits of the single-sex educational environment until recently.</p>
        <p>''If you set up the right atmosphere, girls will be more vocal,'' Ms. Nambo said. ''With boys around, and their aggressive hormones, girls really start to shy down.''</p>
        <p>On this first day of class, one teacher emphasizes the importance of asking questions, urging her students to ''always leave the class asking 'did I understand everything the teacher said?' And if you don't, go ask her.''</p>
        <p>Even Ms. Haag said inner-city all- girls schools probably have more benefits than their suburban counterparts. ''With groups that are disadvantaged, these schools seem to function very well,'' she said. ''Now, at least, we will have the opportunity to study a single-sex schools that aren't exclusive, that don't cater only to higher income students.''</p>
