        <p>COMING this Wednesday to Film Forum is ''Dark Days,'' which explores the homeless community that lives in the train tunnels beneath Manhattan. Dee, a tunnel dweller for a year now, is shown here shaving the head of Ralph, who has lived in the tunnel for three years.</p>
        <p>Marc Singer, the director, made the tunnel his home for the two years that he was working on ''Dark Days.'' His entire production crew consisted of people from the tunnel.</p>
        <p>During the filming, Amtrak officials ordered the residents evicted; the community sought help from the Coalition for the Homeless, and the struggle is depicted in the film.</p>
