        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In his review of ''Extinct Humans,'' by Ian Tattersall and Jeffrey H. Schwartz (Aug. 6), Richard Dawkins finds the authors guilty of ''gratuitous iconoclasm.'' According to Dawkins, the authors' penchant for seeing more species of extinct hominids in the fossil record than has been traditional is trivial, for if we somehow miraculously had a dense and continuous fossil record of human ancestors, presumably we'd have the devil's own time trying to tell different species apart.</p>
        <p>In clinging to this tired myth, Dawkins completely ignores the past 30 years of paleontological research, which has established beyond question that anatomical evolution is intimately associated with true speciation (i.e., the origin of new reproductive communities); species are discrete entities with distinct beginnings (their evolutionary origins) and ends (their extinction). This is as true of Pliocene hominids as it is of Cambrian trilobites and Jurassic dinosaurs. It follows that paleoanthropologists' recognition of species of extinct hominids is absolutely crucial to understanding the evolutionary dynamics underlying human history.</p>
        <p>That the evolutionary process is a bit more complex than Dawkins's own overly simple picture of the fates of selfish genes is the real ''iconoclasm'' perturbing him.</p>
