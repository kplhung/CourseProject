        <p>WHAT with a climb in interest rates, poor weather and a hangover from Year 2000 computer problems, retailers' stocks have been about as popular as last year's fashions. The question is whether they are distressed merchandise or a legitimate bargain.</p>
        <p>Since mid-April, the Standard &amp; Poor's retail stores composite index has tumbled 20 percent -- a decline that analysts attribute mainly to market recognition that, sooner or later, the Federal Reserve always gets its way. And the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, wants consumers to stop spending so much, lest inflation heat up.</p>
        <p>''You can't have six rate hikes without people feeling nervous'' about a diminished impetus to shop, said Carole Cranmer, a retail analyst at Josephthal &amp; Company.</p>
        <p>But analysts are divided. Some say retail stocks have probably hit bottom, while others, like Ursula H. Moran of Sanford C. Bernstein, advise patience, predicting that  prices will be marked down still further.</p>
        <p>''When the Fed wins, it means that spending decelerates,'' Ms. Moran said. ''But history suggests we're not out of the woods yet.'' She noted that it took about a year for retail stock prices to turn higher after the Fed ended its last round of rate increases in 1995. And while the Fed passed up a chance to raise rates last week, it is not yet certain that it is through for this round.</p>
        <p>Still, income and job growth are stronger than they were in 1995, and store executives have quickly learned to harness technology to prevent too much inventory buildup, long a major vulnerability of the industry.</p>
        <p>''There still appears to be the ability to spend,'' said Susan M. Sterne, proprietor of Economic Analysis Associates, which studies consumer behavior. ''I think people are too negative on the stocks; they're running away from them too fast.''</p>
        <p>With some notable exceptions, the stock prices show the damage: Wal-Mart, the world's biggest retailer, is 27 percent below its New Year's Eve high of $70.25. Among others, Federated Department Stores is down 45 percent this year, Gap 42 percent, Circuit City 40 percent, Saks 31 percent, Home Depot 26 percent and Lands' End 24 percent. And Gottschalks, a West Coast chain, trades at just six times earnings, in contrast to an industry average of 28.</p>
        <p>''It was a very weak spring season'' for merchants, Ms. Sterne said. The expected business surge from Y2K has not occurred this year, she noted, although it helped produce a fabulous final 1999 quarter.</p>
        <p>Many companies missed their profit and revenue targets in the second quarter, and others, including Wal-Mart and Target, warned of shortfalls in the current one.</p>
        <p>''We are starting to see the deceleration'' in spending that Mr. Greenspan has been trying to engineer, said George Strachan, senior retail analyst at Goldman Sachs, citing a small decline in comparable-store sales in July, the first monthly contraction since November 1998.</p>
        <p>As a result, Mr. Strachan has removed several of the stocks from his recommended list. And he assigns only a market weighting for the discounters, which generally cope best when business slackens, gaining market share at department stores' expense.</p>
        <p>But Jeffrey M. Feiner, retail analyst at  Lehman Brothers, is upbeat. ''You typically buy the retail stocks when the news gets most negative,'' because they tend to lead the business cycle, Mr. Feiner said. ''Most of the downside is already fully priced into the stocks.'' He predicted a rebound in the first half of next year, perhaps earlier.</p>
        <p>Although some carriage-trade stores like Tiffany have thrived during the economic boom, their stocks have not kept pace. For bargain hunters, however, analysts favor companies like the rapidly expanding Target -- formerly Dayton Hudson -- with a mostly value-conscious core of customers.</p>
        <p>Another common recommendation is Wal-Mart. Although it has withdrawn its ''always the lowest price'' pledge, it is still oriented toward value. ''If consumers really cut back on spending, many will be looking for bargains,'' Mr. Feiner said, and Wal-Mart can use its muscle to beat the prices of  the competition. Despite the company's profit caution, Mr. Feiner reiterated his ''buy'' recommendation this month, as did Credit Suisse First Boston</p>
        <p>Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, however, downgraded the stock, which carried a price-to-earnings multiple of 40 this summer, to ''market perform.''</p>
        <p>Venator, the former Woolworth's, has gained 111 percent this year, and six Wall Street analysts forecast further gains, rating it a buy or strong buy.</p>
        <p>Other companies that Wall Street likes are Talbots, a retailer of classic women's apparel that is one of Merrill Lynch's favorite stocks in any group, and Kohl's, a Wisconsin-based chain that sells what Ms. Moran of Bernstein called a ''carefully edited'' selection of brand-name household goods at highly competitive prices.</p>
        <p>Both companies have spectacularly bucked the downward trend, and the price of Kohl's stock is 58.5 times what the company is expected to earn per share this year. But it could still be a bargain, said Mr. Strachan of Goldman Sachs. With much of the country yet to glimpse its first Kohl's, he called the company ''one of the few blue-sky opportunities left in broad-line retailing.''</p>
