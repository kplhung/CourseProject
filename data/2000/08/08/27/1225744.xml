        <p>Should we conclude from the final verdict of ''Survivor'' that life is a game? Games are metaphors, in that they reframe familiar human events, make them formal, set them apart with beginnings and endings.

In the Western tradition, we take it for granted that the purpose of a game is to win.</p>
        <p>The directors of ''Survivor'' designed their game to require the players to eject other members of their own group and to betray their allies. They surrounded the game with an elaborate and corny setting and a set of rules and rituals that seemed to be inspired by memories of some ill-understood Introduction to Anthropology course. The trappings of a popular image of the primitive were used not only for cosmetic purposes, but also to legitimize behavior that many people would find unacceptable in other contexts.</p>

        <p>Should we conclude from the final verdict of ''Survivor'' that life is a game? Games are metaphors, in that they reframe familiar human events, make them formal, set them apart with beginnings and endings. Games attach some motivation to human activities, along with a certain amount of stage setting: the elegant pieces of a chess set, tennis whites. In the Western tradition, we take it for granted that the purpose of a game is to win.</p>
        <p>The directors of ''Survivor'' designed their game to require the players to eject other members of their own group and to betray their allies. They surrounded the game with an elaborate and corny setting and a set of rules and rituals that seemed to be inspired by memories of some ill-understood Introduction to Anthropology course. The trappings of a popular image of the primitive were used not only for cosmetic purposes, but also to legitimize behavior that many people would find unacceptable in other contexts.</p>
        <p>If, in the course of evolution, human beings really had practiced Hobbes's ''war of all against all,'' our species would not have survived. Nor would we have survived if our families, tribes and communities had been based solely on calculated advantage.</p>
        <p>Human groups that depended on Stone Age technologies also depended on mutual caring. More than any other species, Homo sapiens must learn cooperation. Even some sociobiologists who argue a direct application of the ''survival of the fittest'' acknowledge that fitness refers to reproductive success, which includes, for human beings, caring for the weak.</p>
        <p>One of the distinctive characteristics of our species is the ability to think and communicate about conditions that are not real or not verifiable. We can lie. We can make believe. We can postulate hypothetical subatomic particles and remote planets, opening doorways of scientific exploration. We can believe in gods.  We can play. But it pays to know what we are doing.</p>
        <p>In ''Survivor,'' the prize went to Rich, the player who was apparently clearest from the beginning that this was a game of strategy and alliances. The prize did not go to players who stood firmly on personal honor (Rudy) or emphasized relationships (Susan).</p>
        <p>Several players spoke of what they had learned in the experience -- a kind of reward beyond money. Rich won by concentrating from the start on the game itself -- where Kelly, for example, waffled. But if Rich were to play the game of life only as he played the game of ''Survivor,'' he would be likely to lose in a more fundamental way -- losing the joy that comes with relationships.</p>
        <p>Games draw their metaphors from many sources: big business, power politics, exploration. Game theory tends to focus on the metaphor of competition. As in economic analysis, the theory gets easier if one assumes that human beings have very simple motivations, like always seeking to maximize profit. There is an old joke in which an economist is asked what he would do if he were marooned on a desert island with a case of canned tuna, and he answers, ''assume a can opener.'' The million-dollar prize is the equivalent of the can opener --  something introduced from outside the situation that reduces complex human motivations to a single goal.</p>
        <p>If the outcome of ''Survivor'' convinces people that there is something fundamentally, primally human about competition that legitimizes betrayal, it moves us one step further into being a society whose values are defined by the economists. But if it reminds us of the artificiality of such a society, it can help us avoid the kind of stage setting that forces such behavior. We might move on from the ''Survivor'' motto -- ''Outwit, Outplay, Outlast'' -- to ''Outgrow.''</p>
        <p>The final episode included a test in which the three finalists competed to see who could stand longest on the ends of logs while keeping a hand on a fantasy ''idol.'' This is no more than another piece of kitsch cooked up by the producers, but it makes a suggestive metaphor: Our simplifying assumption about human behavior is the assumption that profit is our god. The danger is that believing it might make it so.</p>
