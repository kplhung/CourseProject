        <p>WHILE the battle to save Manhattan's few neighborhood green spaces rages on, one of the largest community gardens in the country blooms quietly in Brooklyn. Six hundred plots occupy five acres of Floyd Bennett Field, the city's former, and first, municipal airport, best known as the place from which pioneering aviators like Howard Hughes, Jacqueline Cochran and Wrong Way Corrigan flew.</p>
        <p>Though the garden is officially open from April through October, it is not uncommon to see people out planting in early March and harvesting into November. To come upon this fertile rectangle in midsummer is to understand why.</p>
        <p>Five hundred feet to one side is the Rockaway Inlet. Five hundred feet on another is Jamaica Bay. Empty hangers squat in the foreground. Farther out, a Doppler radar tower stands in ominous silhouette. At the entrance, an enormous mound of manure awaits composting, its odor enhanced by that of sage and mint, honeysuckle and roses, peat moss and sunscreen to form a scent one would hardly think of as urban.</p>
        <p>And yet the mix of 473 gardeners is as cosmopolitan as the city itself. A stroll down the neat rows of garden plots comes complete with a soundtrack of voices and transistor radios softly speaking in a variety of languages.</p>
        <p>Small wooden signs designate each garden's owner and personality, as do the many interior touches. A path made of Astroturf or red lies near one made of flattened plastic milk crates. A Puerto Rican flag waves to a nearby statue of Buddha. Guyanese peppers grow alongside water lilies afloat in a goldfish pond. Beans climb wooden teepees. Pinwheels in all colors and sizes spin crazily in the stiff, almost nonstop wind off Jamaica Bay.</p>
        <p>It's as if each 10-by-20-foot plot was bent on recreating the tastes and smells of a different faraway childhood kitchen in Russia or China, in the West Indies or the American Deep South, in Greece or Italy or Queens. And for those who are still young, a new Children's Garden holds Saturday-morning workshops where 5- to 17-year-olds plant and maintain beds of their own design.</p>
        <p>Adult gardeners are allowed only two plots, so many team up with spouses or friends to create larger spaces. Lois Pinetree, a vegetarian who grows much of her own food, works in her designer garden (neatly spaced lettuces are encircled by mesclun greens and decorative rocks) while her partner, Jill Weingarten, is busy building a grape trellis. Other than a common gazebo and picnic area, there is no shade save for what gardeners build themselves.  No trees allowed. And no one's complaining.</p>
        <p>''I lived in an apartment my whole life,'' Ms. Pinetree recalls, ''so when I first started planting, it was like finding a piece of a puzzle. It's not just what's growing. Out here'' -- she gestured to the area across the channel from the Jamaica Bay Bird Sanctuary -- ''we see these incredible birds -- gold finches, red-winged blackbirds, mourning doves. Sometimes there are rabbits, opossum, raccoons and of course that big black garden snake.''</p>
        <p>No one seems to know whether the snake, nicknamed Blackie, is one or more snakes, but as a pest eater he's always welcome, says Susan Tritto, a third-year gardener who starts her seeds in a office on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. The garden association has members from all five boroughs and even Westchester, who till the soil atop what is essentially a sandbox.</p>
        <p>''Our friends think we're crazy,'' says Ms. Tritto's husband, Joe. ''But of course they want the vegetables.'' Zucchini, eggplant, corn, collards, cucumbers, three types of berries, four kinds of tomatoes, five different potatoes, asparagus, squash, snow and snap peas, and scarlet, pole and runner beans, to name just a few. There are the sunflowers, the clematis vines, the lilies and lilac. And all this despite the wind and sand and a rule forbidding chemical pesticides.</p>
        <p>Tom Ingram, an electrical motor repairman who volunteers as caretaker, calls the spot a Shangri-La. But he credits the group effort for that.</p>
        <p>First established in 1970 by the Cornell University Agricultural Extension, the gardens have, since 1996, become an independent, nonprofit organization. In 1997, the National Park Service (of which Floyd Bennett Field is a part) agreed to allow the gardeners to elect their own officials and manage the site themselves. In exchange, the government keeps the gardeners' $25 application fees, putting the burden on the association to raise all necessary money.</p>
        <p>''But we have to do it,'' said Lolita Douglas, the garden's corresponding secretary. ''This is our therapy.''</p>
        <p>Her husband, Allan Douglas Sr., a postal supervisor, also known as Dr. Pepper for his award-winning hot pepper varieties, has been a member of the garden for 17 years and president for the last 3. Under his tenure, the garden has become so successful there is now a two-and-half-year wait for a plot. But Mr. Douglas continues to worry for its future.</p>
        <p>''How can we justify our need to retain this prime property?'' he asked in a newly instituted garden newsletter. ''It is hard to ignore a place of beauty maintained by the dedication and hard work of people who care.''</p>
        <p>Thus, each member is expected to offer at least some services to the garden, for example, to beautify the common grounds, act on one of its committees or teach in community  programs. The latter became a requirement when the association became tax-exempt in 1999. In addition to the Children's Garden and a planned Veteran Memorial Garden, an adult workshop is conducted on Sundays from 2 to 3 p.m. with topics like irrigation systems, stress reduction and meditation. The garden is open for public viewing from sunrise to sunset.</p>
        <p>At dusk, mosquitoes fly in like military aircraft, but if you stand by a citronella torch and gaze north across the abandoned runway, you'll get an unobstructed view of the whole Lower Manhattan skyline. Somehow Brooklyn just disappears.</p>
        <p>DETAILS: If You Go</p>
        <p>Floyd Bennett Field is at the end of Flatbush Avenue, with an entrance just before the Marine Parkway bridge tollbooth. Once a naval air station, the field is home to the Ryan Visitors Center, a small aviation history museum; the Blue Angels Radio Model Flying Club, for radio-controlled airplanes; and Ecology Village, which runs programs for school groups. For a list of events and exhibits or an application for the garden, call (718) 338-3799.</p>
