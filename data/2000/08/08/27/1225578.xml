        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The playwright Kenneth H. Brown, in his letter to the editor [Aug. 20], is mightily upset by the liberties taken in a production of Chekhov's ''Uncle Vanya'' by a Prague troupe. Let me assure Mr. Brown that Chekhov will survive these ''improvements,'' as has Shakespeare. A play from the past has always to deal with two kinds of time: the time in which it was written and the time in which it is being presented. It is the director's job to thoroughly understand both times and to transmit the playwright's intention to his or her contemporaries. If that transaction results in certain excesses, the original remains, ever ready to be readdressed.</p>
