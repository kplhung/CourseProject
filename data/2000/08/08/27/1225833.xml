        <p>It was a tale of two owners' boxes as the 131st running of the Travers Stakes roared into the final hundred yards, with two 3-year-olds hip to hip, trading the lead snout by snout. In one box, the trainer Nick Zito and the owner Tracy Farmer stomped their feet and talked to a television screen, urging their colt Albert the Great to please, please hang on.</p>
        <p>In the other, the trainer Carl Nafzger and the owner James Tafel alternated glances between the hard-striding Unshaded and the finish.

        <p>It was a tale of two owners' boxes as the 131st running of the Travers Stakes roared into the final hundred yards, with two 3-year-olds hip to hip, trading the lead snout by snout. In one box, the trainer Nick Zito and the owner Tracy Farmer stomped their feet and talked to a television screen, urging their colt Albert the Great to please, please hang on.</p>
        <p>In the other, the trainer Carl Nafzger and the owner James Tafel alternated glances between the hard-striding Unshaded and the finish. With a record crowd of 54,116 in full-throated suspense, it was Nafzger and Tafel who leaped to their feet victoriously as Unshaded got his head in front.</p>
        <p>''Shane, baby, did you win that race or what?'' Nafzger said to the winning jockey, Shane Sellers, when the two finally got to talk minutes after the race.</p>
        <p>Sellers, indeed, was the difference in the stretch duel after spotting Jorge Chavez and Albert the Great 6 lengths with a half-mile left in the mile-and-a-quarter race. Twice before, in the Belmont and in the Jim Dandy, Sellers and his closer had loped behind and found a finishing kick only good enough for third. Not this time. Sellers turned his gelding loose at the final turn, picked off Milwaukee Brew and Curule, then split the favorite, Dixie Union, and Commendable. Only Albert the Great remained, which was something of a surprise after he finished dead last in the Jim Dandy, 28 1/2 lengths behind the winner, Graeme Hall.</p>
        <p>But Zito believed his colt was better than that; after all, he had won four straight before the Dandy debacle, and Zito replaced Richard Migliore with Chavez. As Albert the Great rocketed forward in midstretch, Zito looked as if he would win his first Travers in eight tries with a colt dismissed by the public at 8-1 odds.</p>
        <p>''We were fighting neck and neck, head and head,'' said Chavez, who thought he was on the winner. ''It was tremendous.''</p>
        <p>But Unshaded, with Sellers smacking his right hind side with the whip, was bounding up on Albert the Great with strides that just skipped over the ground. ''From the 8th pole to the 16th, I wasn't sure we were going to get there,'' Nafzger confessed. Tafel was also not too sure he would collect the $600,000 first-place check. ''They were ding-donging at each other, and I was just praying that pedigree of Unbridled would kick in,'' he said, referring to Unshaded's sire.</p>
        <p>Sellers knew it would. He had ridden Unshaded for four races since winning the Lexington Stakes in April and knew the gelding was difficult, bordering on ornery. In fact, the same has been said of Sellers, who afterward acknowledged he was on medication for anger management.</p>
        <p>''He has a bad attitude sometimes,'' Sellers said. ''But I know my horse, and I knew his tendency to wait. He just dug down deep and fought hard. He gave it all he had and it was all I had. He takes every ounce of strength out of you.''</p>
        <p>In their box, Zito and Farmer were on the edge of their seats as Albert the Great held the lead until the last 20 yards. But as Unshaded surged forward and stopped the clock at 2:02.59, they went silent.</p>
        <p>''This was one of the toughest races I've ever experienced,'' said Zito, who finished second to Will's Way here with Louis Quatorze in 1996. ''Jorge rode the race I wanted him to ride. Unfortunately, he came a nose short.''</p>
        <p>For Nafzger, it was about keeping his promises. Since February, he has said Unshaded would become just the fifth gelding to win the Travers and that Tafel would have his colors painted on the canoe in the lake of the infield as tradition dictates for the winners. It was also about family.</p>
        <p>''I put my foot in my mouth and he pulls it out,'' he said of Unshaded. ''It is especially nice because I won the Kentucky Derby and the Breeders' Cup with his father.''</p>

        <p>Skimming Takes Pacific Classic</p>
        <p>DEL MAR, Calif., Aug. 26 (AP) -- Skimming, with Garrett Gomez aboard, led the entire way for a two-length victory in the $1 million Pacific Classic today, giving the trainer Bobby Frankel his fifth victory in the 10-year history of the race.</p>
        <p>General Challenge, the 9-10 favorite, placed fourth with the substitute jockey Laffit Pincay Jr. riding. He drew the mount after Corey Nakatani broke his left collarbone in a fall two races earlier. Skimming ran the mile and a quarter in 2:01.22 and paid $11.40.</p>
