        <p>For two years, Mark Cote, a 29-year-old man from Waterbury, Conn., had been seething at a firefighter who he believed had broken up his marriage. The man taunted Mr. Cote continually and accused him of harassment, said Mr. Cote's mother, Rachel Cote.</p>
        <p>Yesterday morning, Mrs. Cote said, her son snapped.</p>
        <p>He took a Tech-9 semiautomatic pistol out to the street; killed his friend and upstairs neighbor, Brian Miller, as he sat in his car; then pushed Mr. Miller's body out and drove off, the police said.</p>
        <p>He sped to the intersection where the firefighter, Jaime Quinones, was collecting money from passing drivers for a muscular dystrophy charity.</p>
        <p>He leaned out the window and shot Mr. Quinones dead, then raced five miles across town to the home of a woman who had recently broken up with him and killed her mother, who also lived there, the police said.</p>
        <p>Then, with police officers converging on the house, he went upstairs to his ex-girlfriend's apartment and put a bullet in his head.</p>
        <p>In less than 20 minutes on a sunny Saturday morning, the police said, Mr. Cote, a phlebotomist at a hospital psychiatric ward, had left four people dead over a seven-mile swath of Waterbury, a struggling old factory city of 105,000 people 85 miles from New York City.</p>
        <p>''If I live a million years I won't understand it,'' Mrs. Cote, 48, said as she stared at the floor in the living room of the apartment she and her son shared on Congress Avenue, a gritty street in a rough blue-collar neighborhood. ''I can comprehend Quinones. I don't condone it but I can comprehend it. But the mother and Brian, I don't know. Brian was his friend.''</p>
        <p>The police could hardly make any more sense of the killings. Lt. Joe Pesce of the Waterbury police said of the first killing: ''Did he shoot him to take the car? Did he shoot him because he was mad at him? We don't know.''</p>
        <p>As for his ex-girlfriend's mother, Maria Hernandez, 40, Lieutenant Pesce said Mr. Cote ''may have just killed her out of spite to get back at the ex-girlfriend.'</p>
        <p>As Mr. Cote (pronounced KO-tee) went on his deadly rampage, the police were always one step behind him, Lieutenant Pesce said. He fired his first shots at 10:51 a.m. in front of his home at 371 Congress Avenue, the police said. He shot Mr. Miller, 30, several times inside his red Honda, hauled him out of the car, shot him several more times -- there were at least eight shots in all -- and left him on the pavement to die, Lieutenant Pesce said.</p>
        <p>Three minutes later and a mile and a half away, at the corner of Highland and Sunnyside Avenues, Mr. Cote found Mr. Quinones, a 38-year-old ex-marine, leaning on the bumper of a firetruck, taking a break from ''passing the boot'' for muscular dystrophy, the acting fire chief, James Trainor, said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cote shot Mr. Quinones several times, then headed down a hill toward the center of town, Lieutenant Pesce said. His ex-girlfriend, Maria Perez, 23, and her mother lived five miles away, on Kenyon Street.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hernandez was in her kitchen  cooking chicken, her relatives said. Mr. Cote entered through the back door and shot her once, her family and the police said.</p>
        <p>At 11:07, someone in Ms. Hernandez's house called 911, but the line went dead, Lieutenant Pesce said.</p>
        <p>The dispatcher called the number back. Mr. Cote picked up.</p>
        <p>He told the dispatcher that everything was fine and that the children must have been playing with the phone, and hung up, the lieutenant said.</p>
        <p>He went upstairs to Ms. Perez's apartment. He did not threaten her or her three children, Lieutenant Pesce said.</p>
        <p>''He just told her that he killed her mother,'' the lieutenant said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Perez apparently ran downstairs to her mother's apartment, because when the 911 dispatcher called back again, she picked up and screamed that Mr. Cote had just killed her mother.</p>
        <p>The police, who were already chasing Mr. Cote from the intersection where he had shot Mr. Quinones, arrived at 16 Kenyon Street and saw the red Honda they had been looking for sitting out front with the engine running. As Ms. Perez ran out of the house with her children, Mr. Cote shot himself in the head inside Ms. Perez's apartment, the police said. He was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cote's mother said his life began to unravel in 1998 when he found out that his wife, Naomi, was having an affair with Mr. Quinones. He immediately left her and moved back in with his mother, she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Quinones had Mr. Cote's wife, but he was not content to let matters rest, Rachel Cote said.</p>
        <p>The firefighter would drive slowly by the Cotes's house frequently, and was still doing it as recently as two days ago, she said. He would sit on the rock wall across the street from the house, just to harass them, she said. He and Mr. Cote's ex-wife would come into the truck stop where Mrs. Cote worked as a waitress and stay for several hours, ''just to rub the salt in,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Quinones's colleagues in the Fire Department, where he had worked for six years, described him as a private man.</p>
        <p>''He didn't discuss the personal issues that he had,'' said Chief Trainor. ''But if he had problems with somebody off the job, do you think he deserved to get killed for it?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cote's ex-wife got a restraining order against him, Mrs. Cote said, and Mr. Cote was accused several times of violating it. The charges never stuck, she said, but all the time Mr. Cote was spending in court made it hard for him to hold onto a job. He lost several jobs as a metal plater, then several months ago found work taking blood from psychiatric patients at Yale-New Haven Hospital.</p>
        <p>Not long after his marriage collapsed, Mr. Cote began seeing Ms.  Perez, Mrs. Cote said.</p>
        <p>Two weeks ago, she broke up with him, but Mrs. Cote insisted that the break was amicable.</p>
        <p>''He wanted more than she was ready to give, but they still talked on the phone,'' Mrs. Cote said. On Monday, she said, Mr. Cote had planned to buy clothes for Ms. Perez's children.</p>
        <p>Outside the house where Ms. Perez and Ms. Hernandez lived, family members recalled that Mr. Cote had a mean temper.</p>
        <p>''I didn't like him from the beginning,'' said Ms. Hernandez's son-in-law Kevin Schock. ''He was argumentative, the way he expressed his ways of showing emotion. He would get mad. He wouldn't think before he did things. He shot her in the kitchen while she was cooking chicken. He came in through the back door and shot her. I hope he burns in hell.''</p>
        <p>His wife, Barbara Schock, Ms. Hernandez's daughter, said: ''She was a good mother. She didn't deserve none of that. She was loved by everybody.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schock said Mr. Cote was upset at Ms. Hernandez because Ms. Perez ''loved her mother more than she loved him.''</p>
        <p>''I guess it's one of those triangle things,'' he said. ''Obsessive love, fatal attraction, however you want to put it.''</p>
        <p>As for Mr. Miller, a construction worker, Mrs. Cote said her son had fought with him a few months ago because the Cotes's dog, a 200-pound Rottweiler-German shepherd mix, kept terrorizing Mr. Miller's much smaller dog, Mrs. Cote said. But the two appeared to have patched things up recently.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Cote said her son was depressed and angry, but she did not see any signs that he was about to self-destruct. He had made plans with a friend to go see a movie last night. He had an appointment to have his car worked on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>The last time she saw her son, Friday night, ''he was fine,'' she said. ''Today his friend came over to go the movies and he had no idea what happened. I told him and he almost passed out.''</p>
