        <p>LONG before anyone ever heard of reality television, or its most recent efflorescence, ''Survivor,'' a group of scientists began putting ordinary people into unusual situations and observing how they behaved.</p>

        <p>LONG before anyone ever heard of reality television, or its most recent efflorescence, ''Survivor,'' a group of scientists began putting ordinary people into unusual situations and observing how they behaved.</p>
        <p>They were social psychologists, experts in the systematic study of behavior. And they had noble aspirations. Stirred by the events of their time -- the Holocaust, prison riots, the indifference of bystanders as a young woman was stabbed to death on a New York street -- they sought to understand the darkest human deeds in the hope of finding ways to prevent them.</p>
        <p>In particular, the psychologists, who carried out a variety of experiments at prestigious universities from the 1950's and into the 1970's, were fascinated by the power of situations to influence people's behavior, sometimes even overriding individual personality traits and the dictates of personal conscience.</p>
        <p>The experiments were compelling, and still enthrall undergraduates when they are taught in introductory psychology courses. In perhaps the most famous, Dr. Stanley Milgram's study of obedience to authority, the subjects meekly delivered what they believed were potentially fatal electric shocks to another person when ordered to do so by an experimenter in a white coat.</p>
        <p>In another, student volunteers at Stanford University who were randomly assigned to play prisoners or guards for a two-week stay in a simulated prison became so caught up in their roles that the study had to be halted after a week.</p>
        <p>But the research also stimulated heated ethical debate. Subjects were sometimes deceived about the true purpose of the experiments, which critics felt was a breach of trust. And some worried about the long-term effects on the subjects, who often acted, under the pressures of the experimental paradigm, in ways they later found abhorrent.</p>
        <p>In a famous 1964 critique, Dr. Diana Baumrind, a psychology professor at the University of California at Berkeley, wrote: ''I would not like to see experiments such as Milgram's proceed unless the subjects were fully informed of the dangers of serious aftereffects and his correctives were clearly shown to be effective in restoring their state of well-being.''</p>
        <p>By the late 1970's, ethical guidelines discouraged the use of most deception in psychological research, and required thorough debriefing of subjects. As a result, neither the Milgram study nor the Stanford prison experiment could be carried out today.</p>
        <p>That is, in the world of science.</p>
        <p>The producers of reality television shows, however, are unfettered by such constraints. Their subjects are ''Survivor'' wannabes, who stand to win fame and fortune. The purpose is simply to entertain, titillate -- and, oh yes, to make money.  And the situations eager contestants are plopped into are limited only by developers' imaginations.</p>
        <p>They can put people on islands and make them eat bugs, walk on hot coals and choose between their comrades (as in ''Survivor''). They can chain four women to a man for a week (as in ''Chains of Love,''  recently bought by NBC). They can, much like the experimenters in the Stanford study, lock people up in prison (as in ''Jailbreak,'' recently acquired by ABC, in which the inmates will try to escape).</p>
        <p>And in a twist that oddly merges the science of the past and the entertainment of the present, one production company, Film Garden Entertainment in Los Angeles, is even planning to re-enact the Milgram study and other social psychology classics in a 13-part series called ''The Human Experiment.''</p>
        <p>''We were very intrigued, long before 'Survivor,' in producing a show that would reveal certain things about human behavior in a context that was entertaining and at the same time educational and legitimate,'' said Nancy Jacobs Miller, Film Garden's president. She said her company, like other producers, is hoping that a cache of reality offerings might see them through an anticipated strike by actors and writers next year.</p>
        <p>Film Garden is also trying to enlist as a consultant Dr. Philip Zimbardo, the Stanford psychology professor who, with two graduate students, directed the prison study three decades ago. Ms. Miller has asked him to help choose experiments and guide their execution.</p>
        <p>But like other psychologists, Dr. Zimbardo, who said he has not decided whether to participate in the project, has a mixed reaction to  reality television.</p>
        <p>On the one hand, he said, ''Survivor'' and other such shows are ''wonderful, because they make the public aware of how fascinating it is to observe human behavior.''</p>
        <p>''Candid Camera,'' he said, was arguably the networks' first venture into reality television. Allen Funt, the show's host, ''was one of the first intuitive psychologists,'' Dr. Zimbardo said. ''He put ordinary people into unusual circumstances and we watched how they improvised. That's what makes people want to be psychologists.''</p>
        <p>In fact, at the American Psychological Association's recent annual meeting, the late Mr. Funt was honored for ''lifelong contributions to psychology and the public.''</p>
        <p>And like the experiments of an earlier era, reality TV shows can be useful in demonstrating the power of circumstance to determine behavior, revealing, Dr. Zimbardo pointed out, ''that people are incredibly complex, and that we can alternately be Hitler at one time and Mother Teresa the next.''</p>
        <p>Yet television is not science, despite the advertisements for ''Survivor'' calling it ''the ultimate human experiment.'' Participants are not randomly selected, the way experimental subjects would be. There are no control groups.</p>
        <p>And the very intensity of such situations presents dangers. ''Simulated reality can become reality,'' Dr. Zimbardo said. ''Everybody knew in the prison study that it was an experiment, which is a formal game. But it didn't make any difference. People were having emotional breakdowns.''</p>
        <p>Psychologists quickly realized the risks of such research, and took steps to address them.</p>
        <p>As a result of the prison study, Dr. Zimbardo said, ''We were able to do good. We were able to convey to the participants what their behavior illustrated. The public learned something. The scientists learned something. And the participants learned something.''</p>
        <p>BUT television makes no attempt to use reality shows as teaching devices. And as it strings the tightwire, it provides few nets. Ever since the suicide of a contestant voted off the original, Swedish version of ''Survivor,'' American networks have tried to screen applicants for psychological problems. Some shows, including ''Survivor,'' have psychologists on staff and provide counseling for participants voted off.</p>
        <p>In general, though, the philosophy appears to be that participants in reality shows know what they are getting into.</p>
        <p>The networks are counting on  what anyone who has taken a psychology course -- and found the Milgram experiment and the Stanford study the most fascinating research the field has to offer -- knows: Reality, even manipulated reality, is hands down more compelling than fiction.</p>
