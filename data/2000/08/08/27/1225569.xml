        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>When someone states that white women have some sort of ''right'' to play the blues, as Dana Jennings does in his article ''They Have a Right to Sing the Blues, and a Reason'' [Aug. 13], I suspect that person is not talking about the blues of Muddy Waters, Bessie Smith or Albert King. Just as the best and most original klezmer music tends to come from Eastern European Jews, the best and most original bluesmen and blueswomen are black Americans.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>When someone states that white women have some sort of ''right'' to play the blues, as Dana Jennings does in his article ''They Have a Right to Sing the Blues, and a Reason'' [Aug. 13], I suspect that person is not talking about the blues of Muddy Waters, Bessie Smith or Albert King. Just as the best and most original klezmer music tends to come from Eastern European Jews, the best and most original bluesmen and blueswomen are black Americans.</p>
        <p>Obviously, white people can sing and perform the blues; many do, with varying levels of competence. However, for whites to try to appropriate a music so deeply bound to black American aesthetics, values and experiences is at best problematic and can be insulting. White women have simply not suffered in Amer  ica to the extent that black people have. Given the patterns of American racism, they couldnt do so even if they wanted to. There does not now exist, nor has there ever existed, a white female equivalent to Howlin' Wolf, Bobby Bland, Brewer Phillips, Dinah Washington or any other black blues artist.</p>
        <p>Although I don't question the earnest feelings for music that Rory Block, Susan Tedeschi and Debbie Davies undoubtedly possess, I feel compelled to point out that all three have received record sales, mainstream recognition and critical acclaim that far exceeds their actual talents. In their chosen arena they are really not much different from  Kid Rock or Eminem. When are we going to see similar accolades granted to Deborah Coleman, Chris Thomas, Queen Esther, Alvin Hart, Theodis Ealey, Lady Bianca and other inventive modern musicians who are part of a living African-American blues culture?</p>
        <p>It's enough to give a man the blues.</p>
