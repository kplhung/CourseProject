        <p>The Secret Parts of Fortune</p>
        <p>Three Decades</p>
        <p>of Intense Investigations</p>
        <p>and Edgy Enthusiasms.</p>
        <p>By Ron Rosenbaum.</p>
        <p>799 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Random House. $29.95.</p>
        <p>It was sometime in the 1970's, as I recall, that National Lampoon ran a comic strip called something like ''Jean-Paul Smart, Existential Detective.'' If there was ever a time to be a philosopher-gumshoe, it was the 70's. Conspiracies lurked under every floorboard. There were too many mysteries, too many suspects, too many motives and not a hint of resolution anywhere. Ron Rosenbaum, as his new omnibus collection of essays and reportage, ''The Secret Parts of Fortune,'' amply demonstrates, built up a pretty good resume for the job. His mission statement appears in ''Oswald's Ghost,'' a 1983 inventory of developments in the Kennedy-assassination industry:</p>
        <p>''When you're dealing with the tangled thicket of theory and conjecture that has overgrown the few established facts in the years since the events of that Nov. 22 . . . you need someone with something akin to what Keats called negative capability -- the ability to abide uncertainties, mysteries and doubts without succumbing to the temptation of premature certainty. You need someone like me.''</p>
        <p>While Dealey Plaza attracted zealots, swindlers, table-rappers, fantasists and paranoiacs of every degree, and while even apparently sane people who joined the investigation never reemerged from the rabbit hole of buffdom, Rosenbaum instead became, as he puts it, a ''buff buff.''</p>
        <p>That phrase pretty well sums up his method. Rather than advancing a theory of his own, he compares all the available theories, consults the experts -- self-appointed or otherwise -- and weighs their judgments one against the other, attempts to steer a sensibly skeptical middle course. Of course, the journey is a lot more important than the destination. He subjects theories to scholastic but frequently puckish close readings, takes note of the experts' facial expressions and what they order for lunch, opens his sails to gossip and jokes. It is the method he employed in his book ''Explaining Hitler'' (1998), and here he applies it to Watergate, to the cancer-cure underground, to Yale's Skull and Bones society, to the warring schools of Dead Sea Scrolls research. He takes on many other webs of conjecture, delusion and uncertainty too -- the most-often-cited name in the book is probably that of the C.I.A.'s fanatic mole-hunter, James Jesus Angleton.</p>
        <p>Rosenbaum's major assets, apart from his tactical detachment, are his enterprise -- in pursuing leads, incessantly making phone calls, reading unedited transcripts -- and his voice. The latter is a masterly concoction, a blend of boy reporter, Ancient Mariner, lounge lizard and grandpa by the fireside. He is a showman, and that allows him to put over dryly complex exposition, minute textual analysis, even (as in the Dead Sea Scrolls business) fearsomely recondite arguments with ease and flair. He is not above using some of the most bewhiskered narrative tricks -- he seems positively addicted to building suspense by means of what we might call the Giant Rat of Sumatra gambit. Like Sherlock Holmes, he gets the reader's pulse racing by naming enigmas that may or may not be explicated anon:</p>
        <p>''It was there that I first discussed such issues as nuclear surrender and the Judo -- yes, Judo -- Christian ethic, and it was there that I first learned the secret of the spoon and the string.''</p>
        <p>''There's a big book located just inside the main entrance to Bones. In it are some of the real secrets. . . . I don't know if the tale of the brokenhearted token gay and the rotting-paella story are in there, but they should be. I'm almost sure the mysterious 'Phil' incident isn't there.''</p>
        <p>Note that these sentences respectively represent the first whisper of the spoon and the string, the brokenhearted gay, the rotting paella, all of which he will relate in due course. He indulges a hipster's affection for the ponderous (as in the subtitles assigned to the pieces here, e.g., ''In Which We Track the Occult Masters of Get-Rich-Quick Literature''). And he displays a taste, not too distant from Woody Allen's, for smashing together high and low culture (as when, in explaining the apocryphal Enoch Scroll, he calls the eternal struggle between good and evil spirits a ''Cosmic Wrestling Federation Soul Slamathon'').</p>
        <p>All but a few of the investigative pieces herein were previously gathered in Rosenbaum's 1991 collection, ''Travels With Dr. Death: And Other Unusual Investigations'' (all but five of that book's pieces are reprinted here). This collection is much more miscellaneous, not necessarily to its profit. There are some entertainingly random magazine items from the 70's and beyond, a selection of his ''lunch'' profiles from the now-defunct Manhattan, Inc. and several hundred pages of selections from his ''Edgy Enthusiast'' column in The New York Observer. The articles are well chosen: an appalling circa-1971 interview with a babbling Troy Donahue is the sort of time-capsule item that anthropologists could use to reconstruct an entire era; a mock investigation of the ''Mr. Whipple'' Charmin commercials is more engrossing than you could possibly expect; his portrait of ''Long Island Babylon'' (from The New York Times Magazine in 1993) is a monument, a sort of inverse epic poem.</p>
        <p>The premise of the pieces he wrote for the short-lived Manhattan, Inc. was that every month he would have lunch with a famous person and engage in wide-ranging talk rather than a mere interview. The idea worked beautifully; Rosenbaum had done his homework, kept his wits sharpened, treated his partners as equals if not cronies, was more than willing to spar with them. Satisfyingly if unsurprisingly, Robin Leach (''Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous'') comes across as a very likable monomaniac with no inner life, Mario Cuomo as a canny poker player with a mystical streak, the late Murray Kempton as a sage and a prophet. (I'm not sure why Rosenbaum omitted his lunch with Roy Cohn, which I remember as deeply chilling, but then I haven't read it in 15 years.)</p>
        <p>For his Observer column Rosenbaum was granted carte blanche. It is every journalist's dream: to hold forth, weekly or semiweekly, on just anything. The results have been mixed. Although the reader of this book is spared his disproportionate fury at ''Seinfeld,'' or his lengthy crusade to crown the city's finest chopped liver, the last third or so of the book is, well, a bit of a trudge. We are all cranks, to one degree or another, and there is nothing for bringing out crankishness like unrestricted access to a pulpit. Rosenbaum can sound like a Hyde Park orator, like a long-haul driver who has picked you up hitchhiking, like a lonely emeritus who still lunches in the faculty common room.</p>
        <p>He is enough of a writer that he can put across the occasional unprovoked memory or haphazard aper--&gt;u with panache and humor, and in almost every piece some turn of phrase or left-field analogy hits the mark. You can even live with his gripes, as if he were a relative (''Oh, that's just Uncle Ron . . .''). But when he enthuses, particularly about literature, he turns into a crashing bore. When he rereads Keats's ''To Autumn,'' for instance, through the lens of Helen Vendler's 1983 essay on the poem, he savors and marvels and waxes elegiac, but it's a private spectacle, as if you were watching him on a dais eating a delicious meal all by himself. He fails to communicate any urgency, fails to make his enthusiasm contagious, fails to enlist the reader's complicity. The showman in him, who can keep the reader interested while he picks through abstruse conspiracy theories, has gone to sleep, along with the Upper East Siders in need of soul-enlargement or whomever else he thinks he's addressing. This anthology, as a self-selected X-ray of 30-odd years of work, makes for an easy diagnosis: the man is not equipped to be a shut-in. He needs fresh air and sunlight, or dank air and twilight, but above all he needs to talk to other people. Let me phrase it as a plea: Ron Rosenbaum, drop that sinecure and get back on the road!</p>
