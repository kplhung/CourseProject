        <p>Riding a wave of success on his prescription-drug plan, Vice President Al Gore plans to dedicate all of next week to a cross-country discussion of health care issues and a comparison of his proposals with those of Gov. George W. Bush.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's advisers, who outlined the strategy in a conference call this morning, said that prescription drugs had emerged as the ''top issue,'' and that Mr. Gore had surged in the polls in part because he had dedicated so much time to the issue.

        <p>Riding a wave of success on his prescription-drug plan, Vice President Al Gore plans to dedicate all of next week to a cross-country discussion of health care issues and a comparison of his proposals with those of Gov. George W. Bush.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's advisers, who outlined the strategy in a conference call this morning, said that prescription drugs had emerged as the ''top issue,'' and that Mr. Gore had surged in the polls in part because he had dedicated so much time to the issue. The Republicans are clearly nervous about the inroads Mr. Gore has made with discussion of his plan and are running $7 million worth of television commercials criticizing the plan.</p>
        <p>The focus on health care reflects in part the shifting demographics of the nation. The 1992 presidential campaign focused on the uninsured and people who did not have health care coverage. Now, with the baby boom generation facing retirement, the focus is on coverage for the elderly and the prices of prescription drugs.</p>
        <p>Under the Gore plan, people 65 and older with low incomes -- falling below 135 percent of the official poverty line -- would get free prescription-drug coverage. Mr. Bush's plan also covers the elderly poor.</p>
        <p>Beyond that, Mr. Gore offers a broader package of prescription drug coverage through Medicare to all elderly patients, while Mr. Bush does not. Under the Gore plan, they could pay premiums of between $25 and $44 per month for coverage of prescription drugs. The plan would cover half of all drug costs up to $5,000 and 100 percent of costs beyond $5,000. The patients would also have the option of buying coverage for catastrophic illnesses.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore sets aside $253 billion over 10 years to cover prescription drugs. Mr. Bush has not specified what he would set aside.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore begins the week in Tallahassee, Fla., with a round-table discussion of his prescription-drug plan. On Tuesday in Albuquerque, N.M., he is to talk about children's health care. His topic will be Medicare on Wednesday in Eugene and Portland in Oregon, and on Thursday he plans a rally in Seattle on the patients' bill of rights.</p>
        <p>This morning's conference call was joined by Dr. David Kessler, the former food and drug commissioner and now dean of the Yale School of Medicine. Dr. Kessler, speaking from Woodbridge, Conn., said Mr. Gore ''has real commitment and real expertise'' on health care issues.</p>
