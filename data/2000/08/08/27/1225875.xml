        <p>This time, they fought in a ring, a place where words and taunts do not make a difference. It is also a place where Fernando Vargas rules.</p>
        <p>Vargas, the International Boxing Federation junior middleweight champion, proved that again tonight, scoring a technical knockout over Ross Thompson, the top-ranked challenger, 1 minute 7 seconds into the fourth round of their scheduled 12-round fight at the Mandalay Bay Events Center.</p>
        <p>Vargas, 22, knocked Thompson down twice in the third round and would most likely have ended the bout right there if not for the bell.</p>
        <p>For Thompson, 27, though, it was only a reprieve. Vargas went after him aggressively to start the fourth, and it did not take long to finish him.</p>
        <p>''I had him hurt, so it was a matter of waiting till I could get a good  shot,'' said Vargas, of Oxnard, Calif., who improved his record to 20-0, with 18 knockouts. ''I had to show him what type of fighter I was.''</p>
        <p>Vargas seemed to be referring to Thompson's behavior at a news conference on Thursday. It was there that Thompson punched Vargas and hit Vargas's promoter, Gary Shaw. Before that display, though, the fight had generated about as much buzz as a golf tournament without Tiger Woods.</p>
        <p>Putting Woods in some trunks, in fact, might have been the only way to  spice things up. The problem was that Thompson, despite his high ranking, had lost decisions in his two biggest fights, against the current World Boxing Association welterweight champion, James Page, in 1996 and Oba Carr in 1997.</p>
        <p>Vargas, off an impressive triumph in April over the former welterweight title-holder Ike Quartey, seemed to be merely tuning up for a unification bout in December against the W.B.A. junior middleweight champion, Felix Trinidad. Nothing has been officially announced.</p>
        <p>But then came Thompson's tirade, which, whether premeditated or spontaneous, altered the script. In a sport that depends heavily on a certain amount of antagonism between its combatants -- genuine or make-believe -- Thompson played the role of the perfect salesman. Even Don King could have taken notes.</p>
        <p>Here's what happened: While doing a television interview Thursday, Thompson was summoned to the dais for the news conference. On his way, he stopped behind Vargas, who apparently said something to him. Thompson then punched Vargas in  the mouth. Vargas retaliated with a left hook, knocking Thompson off the dais. Once he recovered, Thompson went after Vargas again, but instead hit Shaw, Vargas's promoter, with a punch that cut his lip.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, Thompson, accompanied by security officials, was asked to leave the room. But not before he had made his point.</p>
        <p>''He's a bogus champion,'' Thompson said then. ''All the reporters say I shouldn't be here. They haven't seen me fight. You have to understand that I have all this rage built up because of the disrespect put on me. I'm going to win this world title.''</p>
        <p>Vargas did his part, as well, to create interest in the fight.</p>
        <p>''This guy is going to get punished before he gets knocked out,'' Vargas said at the news conference. ''I'm definitely going to carry him for a while. He's going to get hurt. He'll definitely get hurt.''</p>
        <p>Vargas was paid $1 million; Thompson (24-4-1) of Buffalo, earned $300,000.</p>
        <p>A match tonight between Vernon Forrest and Raul Frank for the vacant I.B.F. welterweight championship was ruled no contest when the two fighters accidentally butted heads in the third round. Frank, who had blood pouring from his face, was not able to continue.</p>
