        <p>ONE October evening in 1994, a scruffy pod of homeless people sitting around a fire in the dank, dark Amtrak tunnel they lived in beneath Manhattan heard a thin, animated man named Ralph come up with an idea.

        <p>ONE October evening in 1994, a scruffy pod of homeless people sitting around a fire in the dank, dark Amtrak tunnel they lived in beneath Manhattan heard a thin, animated man named Ralph come up with an idea. ''Someone should be making a film about this stuff,'' he said. The others nodded or laughed or agreed or shook their heads at the absurdity of the thought, and the conversation moved on.</p>
        <p>Marc Singer still finds it hard to believe that such an idle remark could have inspired his odyssey, one that led a 20-year-old who had never picked up a camera to live underground himself, enlist his fellow outcasts as his crew and put together an 84-minute, black-and-white documentary that won three awards at this year's Sundance Film Festival.</p>
        <p>But when Mr. Singer's ''Dark Days'' opens for a two-week run at the Film Forum in New York on Wednesday -- with bookings in six other cities set after that -- it will mark the culmination of six years of work that in almost every way mirrored the life-on-the-edge existence of his compatriots.</p>
        <p>The film was cobbled together through grit, guile and an ability to rummage through society's detritus and spare parts. It was done in utter isolation from anything resembling the mainstream world of film. It was a project whose survival was always not just in doubt but highly unlikely. In the end, it reached an improbably redemptive conclusion.</p>
        <p>If the documentary is unlikely to change too many minds about the nature of the homeless, it allowed Mr. Singer, who grew up in an upper-middle class family in London and came to New York with hopes of becoming a fashion model, to succeed in his aim of making not just visible, but thoroughly human, New York's invisible people.</p>
        <p>''Our main goal, crazy as it sounds, was to make enough money to get everyone out of the tunnel,'' said Mr. Singer, 26, whose restless energy, close cropped hair, white T-shirts and cargo pants, summon up the street more than the runway. ''But the other goal was to just let people see the homeless as they are, so maybe they'll look at them with less hatred.</p>
        <p>''I never wanted to go on a mission with this film. I never wanted to convert anyone into helping the homeless. But we look at them as if they're not human. It's like there's an invisible wall there. But you go and meet them, and it turns out they're just like me and you; they just don't have a  home.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Singer's unlikely journey began when he was living in the East Village, shortly after he moved to New York from Miami. He came to know some of the street people in his neighborhood and through them learned about the subculture of ''mole people'' living in the railroad tunnels from 72nd Street to 125th Street underneath the West Side Highway. There were from 50 to 75 of them in the winter and perhaps 150 to 200 in the summer, and soon he found himself spending most of his time with them by the plywood shacks, makeshift shanties and nightly campfires they built alongside the railroad tracks.</p>
        <p>And rather than thinking of Ralph's idea as a stray pipe dream, he took it on -- first as a quixotic project, then as something close to an obsession. He began by getting Cinevision, the downtown camera shop, to give him the use of what became the first of four Arriflex SR2 16-millimeter cameras he used to make the film. He sold most of his belongings, and finally even his own bed, to buy film and supplies. When he ran out of film and money, Kodak gave him much of what he needed free of charge. He took to living underground with his subjects and eventually became homeless too. A friend went to the bank and gave him his last $10,000. He did not have a print to take to Sundance until the day he got on the plane and carried it with him.</p>
        <p>From the start, the homeless people -- identified in the credits only by their first names -- became not just his subjects but his collaborators. Mr. Singer and the tunnel people all trooped off together to see the documentary ''Hoop Dreams'' and decided they could make a film, too. They became Mr. Singer's film crew, learning and improvising as they went along, much as he did. When they needed a dolly, they built one using an old grocery cart and an abandoned stretch of rail. They ran cable underground, hooked up to whatever power source they could find, and for lighting used hand-held floodlights mounted on metal crosses. He gave a dozen of the homeless -- three of whom died before the film could be released -- part ownership in the film, so they stand to profit if it makes money.</p>
        <p>What he captured was a life underground that was at once entirely alien and oddly familiar. Mr. Singer's friends cooked over fires and small stoves. They listened to radios and watched television, using electricity tapped illegally from aboveground. They sat in their shacks in T-shirts emblazoned ''Bank of America'' or ''Republican National Convention,'' with a dog at their feet and pictures on the wall, discussing favorite recipes, long-lost pets and sometimes horrific family tragedies. They got food from scavenging through garbage and showered under a leaky water pipe.</p>
        <p>But through much of the film they seem not so much homeless as people whose home happens to be 50 feet underground, one that can be torn down with a sledgehammer in about five minutes.</p>
        <p>The resulting portrait is tantalizingly complex: at one moment there are rats scurrying around; in the next, it all seems vaguely homey. And while the subjects come across for the most part as articulate hosts and raconteurs, they are also capable of lacerating confession and crack-addled delusion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Singer's unconventional film concludes with the most conventional of scenes, one depicting the bliss the homeless people ascend to when, after being evicted from the tunnel, they find themselves in clean, private apartments paid for with Section 8 government-subsidized housing vouchers.</p>
        <p>INSTEAD of romanticizing the homeless or vilifying the Amtrak officials who evicted them, the film reminds us that the people on the street -- or under it -- want nothing so much as a home.</p>
        <p>That said, Mr. Singer takes pains to point out that his subjects aren't stand-ins for ''the homeless,'' a more-or-less homogeneous group of society's victims. ''People on the street get lumped together, but there are so many types,'' he said. ''There are people who are mentally ill and people on the street fleeing abusive homes, there are runaway kids on drugs, there are people who've been burned out of their house and have nowhere to go.</p>
        <p>''There are a million ways that people can get on the street, and there are bad people there. But there are a lot of good people, too. And I ended up with enormous respect for everyone in the tunnel, because they just wouldn't give up.</p>
        <p>''I put myself in that situation, and I wonder what would I have done? Would I have given up, because it would have been easy to do. I mean out of sight, out of mind, and how much further out of sight can you get than living in a tunnel?''</p>
        <p>In the same way, the making of the film was very much a process of clawing in the direction of survival. ''Marc's incredibly confident and incredibly determined,'' said Melissa Neidich, the film's editor. ''If he wants to learn something, he'll learn it completely. If he wants to do something, he'll do what he has to do to master it. That's the way he was able to get this done.''</p>
        <p>But after devoting six years to the film, Mr. Singer views its theatrical release with mixed feelings of excitement, trepidation and, finally, an urge to move on.</p>
        <p>''I'm so ready to let go of it, mate,'' he said. ''Six years is a long time to think about something seven days a week, often 20 hours a day. I can't get past it yet, but I'm looking forward to when I can. What I'd like to do is get away, sit on a beach and think the bloody ocean is a lovely color blue.''</p>
