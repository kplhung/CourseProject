        <p>Mistakes can happen, of course, but in a nation that gives high priority to human dignity and justice, I would think that an innocent person like Kerry Sanders ought to receive full compensation for his unjust suffering, without quibble or delay. What seems to be happening, however, is that he is facing a chorus of denials, years of legal rigmarole and perhaps, in the end, no adequate payment or accountability. We shall see what happens.</p>
