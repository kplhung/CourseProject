        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Recently Russian leaders chose to ignore the pleas of their people to accept help on a sunken submarine. I'd like to think we are not like that in New Jersey. However, our state's leaders, namely Governor Whitman and Jack Collins, the speaker of the Assembly, appear to be following suit. By ignoring the plethora of requests from state residents, they are consciously killing the Black Bear Protection Bill. This is conveniently occurring before Sept. 18, the day a black bear hunt is scheduled.</p>
        <p>To date, 20 North Jersey towns and environmental committees have passed resolutions to ban the bear hunt. In an independent survey, 61 percent of New Jersey residents did not want a bear hunt. Twenty-four organizations with memberships totaling more than 230,000 oppose the hunt.</p>

        <p>The Senate version of the bear protection bill passed overwhelmingly. The people of New Jersey are simply asking for a stay of execution for the bears until the bill is released from committee and voted on in the Assembly.</p>
