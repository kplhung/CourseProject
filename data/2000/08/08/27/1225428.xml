        <p>GRAVEYARD OF</p>
        <p>THE ATLANTIC</p>
        <p>Short Stories.</p>
        <p>By Alyson Hagy.</p>
        <p>186 pp. St. Paul:</p>
        <p>Graywolf Press. Paper, $14.</p>
        <p>THE ''graveyard of the Atlantic'' is a nickname for North Carolina's Outer Banks, but the title of Alyson Hagy's fourth book is also a caveat of sorts: the stories set here will little resemble the airbrushed Outer Banks of Coppertone vacations, peppermint-stick lighthouses and legends of Blackbeard. Stripped of its beach cottages and sentiment, this is America's breakwater -- a fractured comma of sand and cordgrass, its shoals a boneyard for ships that confuse this place with sanctuary.</p>
        <p>The Outer Banks can be equally unforgiving to those onshore, who are inexorably drawn to what Hagy calls this ''rough hem of the Atlantic.'' Peopling her poetic if imperfect new collection of stories are the kind of folks you'd expect to find at a Nag's Head Dairy Queen: the retiree, the fisherman, the Coast Guard crew member. Like the wrecks that ring the shores of this narrow string of islands, death haunts the fringes of their lives. Yet the departed often seem no more distant to these characters than their all-too-living co-workers, neighbors and spouses, with whom deep connection is an elusive, almost dangerous prospect. In ''Semper Paratus,'' for example, the uneasy relationship between a young woman and her all-male search-and-rescue crew crests in an attempt to save a drowning girl from a skiff being battered in a sudden gale. The rescue fails, as do the awkward attempts by the narrator and a comrade to grow closer in the tragedy's wake.</p>
        <p>Hagy's characters are isolated; their grief is private. Surrounded by salt water, they shed few tears. Yet those who remain ''aboard'' are not so much macho victors as bruised survivors. In their ability to endure, they recall the protagonist of Hagy's recent novel, ''Keeneland,'' and the characters in ''Hardware River,'' a previous story collection. In both these books, people often find it difficult to escape the shadow of what they've survived, which pulls at them as relentlessly as a coastal undertow. ''What was once a refuge for pirates has become a haven of regret, home to those who still hope to go down with the ship,'' says the stubbornly grieving widow who narrates ''North of Fear, South of Kill Devil.'' She defiantly adds, ''I've earned my ruined heart.''</p>
        <p>The most satisfying aspect of these sober stories is Hagy's language, particularly when she abandons high-flown poetics for more homespun talk and imagery. ''He's got restlessness like it's a four-season allergy,'' the narrator of ''Semper Paratus'' remarks as she watches a fellow seaman work a pool table. ''His body knows how to burn unhappiness for fuel.''</p>
        <p>Given Hagy's invigorating voice and her wonderful renderings of this landscape, with all that ''moon-drawn water'' offshore, it's doubly frustrating when her stories -- as good as they are in places -- start to spring leaks. Several are told in such an elliptical manner that their characters seem unmoored from motivation. These stories' climaxes feel unearned, even confusing -- as in the case of ''Search Bay,'' the book's last and longest.</p>
        <p>Set not in North Carolina but on the freshwater coast of Lake Huron, ''Search Bay'' revolves around an old, reclusive third mate who unexpectedly encounters the son of a female bar owner he was once fond of. The second meeting between these two collapses into a violent argument. Later, the old man hears of the boy's fatal plunge into the frozen lake, news that dredges up memories of another death long ago. Here I found myself flipping back fruitlessly in search of a passage I thought I'd missed, something that would yoke the deaths and unify the story.</p>
        <p>Vacation readers on their beach towels might be forgiven for not swapping John Grisham's latest doorstop for this book's grim depiction of people who inhabit the underside of a weekenders' paradise. Still, Hagy's writing and characters are worth getting to know -- perhaps in the evening, when the day's tan is revealed as sunburn and the bathing beauties have been replaced by scuttling crabs.</p>
