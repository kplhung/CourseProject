        <p>MANY a gardener grows coral bells, but only a few do so for the sake of their flowers.</p>
        <p>Not that coral bells don't have lovely flowers. They do. They send up spikes covered with small bell-shaped blossoms in colors from pure white to purple-scarlet. The flowers, bobbing atop stems so slender they are almost invisible, look as if they are floating above the plant, not tethered to it at all.</p>

        <p>MANY a gardener grows coral bells, but only a few do so for the sake of their flowers.</p>
        <p>Not that coral bells don't have lovely flowers. They do. They send up spikes covered with small bell-shaped blossoms in colors from pure white to purple-scarlet. The flowers, bobbing atop stems so slender they are almost invisible, look as if they are floating above the plant, not tethered to it at all.</p>
        <p>What's more, coral bells have an extraordinarily long season of bloom for perennials. In my Pennsylvania garden, plants in full sun bloomed from April through June and, if the faded blooms were cut back, again in September. The ones that got only half a day of sun often started in May and bloomed into August.</p>
        <p>But coral bells, whose botanical name is heuchera (pronounced HEW-ker-ah), are usually valued most for their foliage. The leaves are round or heart-shaped and sprout from a central crown, giving the plant an attractive mounded form. Many perennials look a bit tattered after they're done blooming, but coral bells look fresh all season. They even stay green in winter in most climates.</p>
        <p>Coral bells are sun lovers, especially in the North, and they do best in soil that is moist but well drained. Sandy soil is fine; clay is not. But while they flourish in a sunny spot with rich soil, they'll also survive and look decent in fairly dry soil in a partly shady spot. They'll even grow under a black walnut tree, where few plants care to be.</p>
        <p>A plant that will grow where many plants won't can expect to be planted there. I've seen many a garden with a collection of undernourished coral bells hugging a western wall or grubbing for moisture under the rose of Sharon bushes.</p>
        <p>Because of their subdued good looks and tidy growing habits (they tend to stay where they're planted, rather than invade the rest of the garden), coral bells often also see duty as foils for more flamboyant plants -- as a ground cover in the rose garden, in drifts between silvery-leafed artemisias or as an edging plant.</p>
        <p>But coral bells have recently been liberated from the backstage and supporting roles in the garden. Plant breeders are turning out some cultivars that deserve star billing. They're so flashy they may need some background plants of their own.</p>
        <p>Among the earliest of the new breed of coral bells was a cultivar called Palace Purple, which had large bronzy-red and purple leaves and white flowers on 18-inch stems. It was unusual, looked great and was easy to grow -- prizewinning characteristics that won it the Perennial Plant Association's designation of perennial plant of the year in 1991.</p>
        <p>Beautiful as it is, I still use Palace Purple mostly in the background or foreground to highlight more brightly colored flowers and plants. It is spectacular growing behind flowering forget-me-nots or soapwort, where it continues to look good after those spring bloomers stop flowering. It is lovely growing in front of Russian sage, woolly betony or any of the blue- or silver-leafed ornamental grasses. I like it in drifts with day lilies, too.</p>
        <p>Palace Purple is a hybrid of Heuchera micrantha. Most of the standard red-flowered cultivars are selections from the species H. sanguinea. But there are around 50 other species of heuchera, and breeders have used several to create stunning new cultivars. There are cultivars with leaves up to 10 inches across. Foliage colors range from metallic silver to chocolate brown and olive green, some with ruffled or deeply cut foliage.</p>
        <p>Many of the newer cultivars are hybrids of several heuchera species, often including H. americana. This native species is even more shade- and drought-tolerant than most heucheras, and is resistant to the mildew that plagues coral bells in humid climates. As a result, the plant is not only showier than standard coral bells, but also more rugged in the garden.</p>
        <p>To be honest, some of the newly introduced coral bells are a mite overdone for my taste. I like the one called Plum Pudding, which is richer in color than Palace Purple, and Regal Robe, which has dark green leaves with a silvery overlay and black veins. Pewter Veil is an interesting silvery olive color with reddish edges to the leaves.</p>
        <p>But the coffee- and chocolate-colored cultivars don't appeal to me much, and the intensely silver cultivars, like Mint Julep and Mint Frost, look more like caladiums than coral bells. These might eventually grow on me; I wasn't keen on the white-leafed lamiums when I first saw them, either. But they can easily be overdone, and one of the beauties of the old-fashioned coral bells is that it is almost impossible to have too many.</p>
        <p>That won't be an immediate problem with the new cultivars, which tend to be pricey -- up to twice the price of a more familiar variety like Firefly or White Cloud. But like all coral bells, they can and should be divided every few years.</p>
        <p>The flashy new coral bells are gradually making their way into garden centers, or can be ordered by mail. Two sources are the Primrose Path, 921 Scottdale-Dawson Road, Scottdale, Pa. 15683, (724) 887-6756, www.theprimrosepath.com, and Roslyn Nursery, 211 Burrs Lane, Dix Hills, N.Y. 11746, (631) 643-9347, www.roslynnursery.com.</p>
        <p>Oh, yes. The breeders are also working on cultivars of coral bells that have extra-tall, extra-prolific stems of extra-large flowers. The idea is to make the plant more useful for cut flower production. I, for one, would happily grow them for the sake of my garden.</p>
