        <p>Like dancers in a ballet, 20 riders circled in front of the Central Park bandshell on their recumbent bicycles one recent Sunday.</p>
        <p>They pedaled with their legs out in front, their seats low to the ground. There were bikes with long frames and with short frames, bikes with aerodynamic windshields and racing tricycles.</p>
        <p>Encased in foam with a hole for the rider's head, one tiny recumbent, or bent, as the riders call them, hurtled along like a missile.</p>
        <p>The Metro Area Recumbent Society, MARS, which was founded in 1997 and has doubled its membership to 60 in the last year, was warming up for its Sunday group ride.</p>
        <p>The riders ranged in age from 11 to 74, but, reflecting the recumbent's key demographic, most were middle-age men.</p>
        <p>''It feels like you're pedaling your couch,'' said Shelly Mossey, 45, president of the society and owner of three recumbents.</p>
        <p>Indeed, enthusiasts say, the sitting position prevents shoulder and wrist strain, and that bane of cyclists, a sore rear end.</p>
        <p>At Bicycle Habitat in Greenwich Village, recumbent sales have doubled so far this year to 15, Charlie McCorkell, the owner, said.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCorkell's is one of the few local stores that carry the bikes; most New Yorkers order them from  manufacturers in the Midwest or West, at prices of $500 to $7,000, though some build their own.</p>
        <p>Orville Burkley, 45, a decorator in Harlem, says he has put half a million miles on his 18-year-old recumbent, customizing it with a trailer to hold camping gear, a radio with twin speakers and a sea of small lights. He and four other cyclists take regular weekend rides of 100 miles or more, staying overnight at campsites.</p>
        <p>''When we ride around, it's like a circus,'' Mr. Burkley said. ''We can't stop anywhere because it creates a big crowd.''</p>
