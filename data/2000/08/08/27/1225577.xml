        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Phillip Lopate's article ''When Foreign Movies Mattered'' [Aug. 13] noted the increase in the number of art houses in the United States from 1945 to 1960. Art houses began in the 1920's when my father, Michael Mindlin, opened the first, the Fifth Avenue Playhouse, and then the 57th Street Playhouse, the 55th Street Playhouse, the Brooklyn Playhouse, the Newark Playhouse and the Chicago Playhouse. They all served coffee, not espresso, and in almost all there were Ping-Pong rooms in which members of the audience could play the game while waiting for the feature to begin. My one clear memory of them was when I was a little boy in the early 30's and my father took me to the Fifth Avenue Playhouse to see the revival of ''Nanook of the North'' and to meet the man who made it, Robert Flaherty.</p>
