        <p>PEOPLE may scoff at the notion of curling up in a computer chair with with John Grisham's latest thriller on their screen. But a good novel aside, e-books may be the best thing for doing research since the Dewey Decimal System.</p>
        <p>These electronic versions of traditional-bound volumes are now available at several Connecticut libraries, and in many cases patrons can not only borrow research material and best-sellers but also check out the latest technology.</p>
        <p>Imagine that you are up late writing a report. The library is closed, but its Web site is not. You can download an e-book onto your computer, do a keyword search on a topic, then cut and paste or use any other Windows tool to manipulate the copy.</p>
        <p>Afterward, you don't even need to take the book back. It gets returned automatically.</p>
        <p>''I think it has enormous potential,'' said Louise Blalock, chief librarian of the Hartford Public Library about the e-books, ''and it's the future.''</p>
        <p>Along with the Darien Public Library and the Ferguson Library in Stamford, Hartford is one of three sites in Connecticut and 70 nationwide participating in a six-month market trial with netLibrary, a company based in Boulder, Colo.</p>
        <p>During the trial, netLibary is offering a selection of 1,500 copyrighted titles free via an Internet link 24 hours a day to patrons of the participating libraries. It will also make available 4,333 books that are in the public domain because their copyrights have expired.</p>
        <p>NetLibrary will charge libraries one and a half times the list price of a traditional book if the libraries choose to continue the program. For example, a book that retails for $25 would cost $37.50. The profits get split 50-50 between netLibrary and the publisher.</p>
        <p>Bibliomation, an on-line cooperative of  Connecticut libraries, has just become the first venture in the state to sign a contract with netLibrary to actually buy e-books for use by library patrons.</p>
        <p>Bibliomation bought 505 e-books from netLibrary, including computer, career and  business books. These will become accessible starting in early September to patrons of their members, which include public libraries in Fairfield, Ridgefield, New Milford, Bethel, Brookfield, Ellington, Mansfield,  Tolland, Killingly, Somers, Ansonia, Derby and Seymour. (Of the 41 members of Bibliomation, which is based in Stamford, 34 are public libraries; others are school and academic libraries.)</p>
        <p>''It's just like CD-ROM and every other technological breakthrough so far,'' said Pat Copes, regional projects coordinator of the Capitol Region Library Council.  ''There's a learning curve, and all of a sudden you wonder how you ever got along without it.''</p>
        <p>For now, during its market trial, netLibrary has imposed a check-out period of 24 hours for e-books at all participating libraries. (After the trial is over, libraries that choose to purchase a collection from netLibrary will be free to set their own borrowing periods, which might range from two hours for a reference book to several weeks for popular titles.)</p>
        <p>The majority of the titles available now are reference books in the how-to and self-help modes, including Cliffs Notes, MacMillan's Complete Idiot's Guides and the Health Communications series that serves up Chicken Soup for virtually every soul. There is no fiction of recent vintage.</p>
        <p>During the trial period, e-books from the Hartford Public Library are available to the general public via the library's Web site, www.hart fordpl.lib.ct.us. Instructions will instruct borrowers how to create a password.</p>
        <p>After the six-month trial period is over in January, ''secure measures will be taken,'' said Catherine D'Italia of the Hartford library. ''Access will be through your library card and you will be a registered e-book user the way you are a registered book borrower.''</p>
        <p>Whether the e-books are read while connected to the Internet or after being downloaded onto a personal computer, there is an encryption code that includes a timer, which  eventually turns the book off. After that, the patron will be unable to open the book again on the computer without checking it out again from the library. In other words, the patron is never stuck with a late fee.</p>
        <p>''We feel it's important to be ahead of the curve on this resource,'' said Ms. Blalock.</p>
        <p>Last year, there were more than one million electronic searches done within her library, and its Web site now averages 1,100 hits a day. She sees the e-book as a vital step in this progression.</p>
        <p>''It's a powerhouse of information,'' Ms. Blalock said. ''Not only do we see it as an opportunity for our customers, but also an opportunity for our staff to expand their resources and give people access to the information they need and want.''</p>
        <p>What patrons of the Darien Public Library need and want includes titles from popular authors. So in addition to contracting with netLibrary, it has begun circulating the Rocket eBook, a 22-ounce, hand-held electronic reading device.</p>
        <p>Besides Darien, Enfield and Newington, three other libraries are circulating Rocket eBooks: Essex, Farmington and Guilford. There are eight others that expect to be lending  the devices soon: Cromwell, Ridgefield, Monroe, Fairfield, Westport, Norfolk, Plainville, and the Cora Belden Library in Rocky Hill.</p>
        <p>The Rocket eBook, first introduced in 1998, is about the size of a paperback book, yet able to hold up to 4,000 pages (roughly 10 novels). Darien bought three. ''It's just one more tool that we want to use to provide greater access to materials for our patrons,'' said Mary Fox, head of the library's reference department.</p>
        <p>The Rocket eBook does not allow for downloading books from netLibrary. The device, which costs about $200, is available for sale only on the Internet. And, again, best-selling titles for the Rocket eBook remain vastly limited, although that may change soon, according to at least one major publisher.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, Random House announced its first e-book imprint, to be known as AtRandom, which next year will begin publishing original works of fiction and non-fiction exclusively in electronic form. Stuart Applebaum, a corporate spokesman for Random House, predicted that many first-run titles might be released simultaneously in both traditional and electronic form in the near future.</p>
        <p>That is welcome news in Newington, where the Lucy Robbins Welles Library is circulating two Rocket eBooks.</p>
        <p>''Our patrons have come to expect that we offer the latest in technology,'' said its director, Marian Amodeo, ''and that was the next step.''</p>
        <p>Before lending the Rocket to the public, Ms. Amodeo felt obliged to try it out herself, to her own unexpected delight. ''I loved it!'' she said, noting that its backlit feature makes it especially suitable for night reading.</p>
        <p>Larry Sheehan, a Newington psychotherapist, was among the first patrons to take out a Rocket eBook for a test run last month. ''In addition to being a book person, I'm also a gadget freak,'' said Mr. Sheehan, 67, who was favorably impressed.</p>
        <p>''It was quite convenient to be able to turn the page by just pressing a button,'' he said, observing that this was most useful if you happened to be trying to digest a good book along with dinner.</p>
        <p>Bypassing several business manuals and thrillers the library staff had downloaded, he chose to read Shakespeare's ''A Midsummer-Night's Dream'' and ''Traveling Mercies,'' a book of essays by Anne Lamott. He would consider another go-round if more selections to his taste were offered but said he doubted the format would ever become anything more than a novelty for him. ''It was a fun thing to do, but I'm just too ingrained in the old ways, I guess,'' he said. ''It just doesn't have the feel of a book.''</p>
        <p>Such prejudices have led the Ferguson Library in Stamford to hold off on investing in the Rocket eBook or any other such hand-held devices for now. Instead, it is wading in one step at a time, via netLibrary.</p>
        <p>''We're probably at the clunkiest stage of e-book development right now,'' said Alice Knapp, Ferguson's director of public services. Yet she remains excited about future prospects. ''I see a lot of applications for them.''</p>
        <p>So, evidently, do her patrons. In the first month of the market trial, 92 e-books were checked out from netLibrary, she said. ''I think that's pretty stunning.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Knapp said the novelty of checking out e-books has also helped invigorate interest in the library's traditional resources. ''It's made reading fun again,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The Enfield Public Library has one Rocket eBook and it has been in constant circulation since being introduced in May. ''The only time it's been in the library is while it waits for the next person to pick it up,'' said Henry Dutcher, the library's director.</p>
        <p>Even so, he is hesitant to supplement the library's supply yet, because of the typical computer buyer's mentality of wondering what better model will come out. ''Eventually, you have to stop and buy,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dutcher also has reservations about signing on with netLibrary.  Although Enfield belongs to the Capitol Region Library Council, he harbors some doubts that e-books will serve his patrons' needs. ''If I were an academic library, I would definitely be looking at netLibrary,'' he said. ''I'm not that. I'm a public library.''</p>
        <p>His patrons are more oriented toward reading fiction and popular nonfiction, he said.</p>
        <p>Whatever lasting power e-books may have, they appear to be durable. When one borrower in Enfield let her Rocket eBook slip into her grandson's hands, he accidentally deleted all eight e-books it held. To her relief, and the library staff's, it took only about six minutes to download all eight titles onto it again.</p>
        <p>''We said, 'Oh, this is a good experiment,' '' said Mary Palomba, the library's assistant director.</p>
        <p>Despite allowing patrons to check out such a pricey item, the libraries are not asking for a credit card, monetary deposit, or any other kind of security. ''We don't feel it's necessary,'' said Mary Fox, head of the reference department in Darien, observing that libraries are in the business of loaning out valuable things. ''It's part of who we are and what we do.''</p>
        <p>Darien charges a late fee of $1 a day for the Rocket eBook.</p>
        <p>The Darien library is, however, requesting a credit card number from people who borrow laptops for reading netLibrary e-books or for other purposes. ''This is an expensive piece of hardware, over $2,000 worth of computer, that we're letting them take home,'' said Ms. Fox, noting that patrons ''don't expect that level of trust.''</p>
        <p>Someday, Ms. Palomba predicted, schools will issue e-book readers to students with an entire year of texts, and that is all they will need to carry in their backpacks.</p>
        <p>The realm of possibilities seems endless. ''Yet I don't think we'll ever lose the book itself as the medium that people want to read,'' Ms. Palomba said. ''You really can't replace the feel of that page, or the suspense of turning the page to see what happens next.''</p>
