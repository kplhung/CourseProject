        <p>David English letter on Joyce Purnick's July 30 review of book Madam President by Eleanor Clift and Tom Brazaitis, citing 1979 appointment of Margaret Thatcher as England's Prime Minister, debunks myth about lack of female presidential and vice presidential candidates (S)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In her review of ''Madam President,'' by Eleanor Clift and Tom Brazaitis (July 30), Joyce Purnick attributes the perennial scarcity of female presidential and vice-presidential candidates to not enough women being ''in the pipeline,'' that is, in high-visibility positions. This is a logical point. But it leads me to wonder if the British political pipeline was inhabited by women to any significantly greater degree in 1979, when Margaret Thatcher became prime minister. Purnick points out that in public life ''a woman's looks are still so important,'' but Lord knows, Thatcher did not rise to the top on the babe factor. Even less was she endowed with compassion, one of the qualities that John F. Kennedy declared the first woman president would need in plenty. Margaret Thatcher, for all her breathtaking dearth of personal magnetism and devastating economic restructuring, remained in office 11 years. What did Maggie have that today's women politicians lack? Who knows? Maybe it was her sensible shoes.</p>
