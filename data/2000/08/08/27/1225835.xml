        <p>Jacqueline Ingrassia established a first in the Yonkers Trot tonight just by getting behind the gate. Then she became the first woman to win the Trot, guiding Goalfish past the favored Approved Action down the stretch at Yonkers Raceway.</p>

        <p>Jacqueline Ingrassia established a first in the Yonkers Trot tonight just by getting behind the gate. Then she became the first woman to win the Trot, guiding Goalfish past the favored Approved Action down the stretch at Yonkers Raceway.</p>
        <p>Ingrassia captured the $345,403 race, the second jewel of trotting's triple crown, by watching from a safe distance while Approved Action burst into the lead heading into the final turn. But as Approved Action headed into the stretch, Ingrassia went three wide with Goalfish, coasting past Approved Action and winning by a head in 1:59.</p>
        <p>The favorite, driven by Rejean Daigneault, could not keep up after racing hard from the No. 7 post to take the lead, and settled for second place. Brumal Hanover finished third, 4 lengths back.</p>
        <p>''The trip was just a dream trip,'' Ingrassia said. ''If I planned it, I couldn't have planned it better. I thought at the half I had a ton of horse and I was considering going three deep down the back side, but I saw Rejean still had horse. I took a shot that the favorite would carry me a good long way and he did. I thought of trying for the lead back there, but patience paid off.''</p>
        <p>While this was a night of firsts for Ingrassia, she made her mark on the sport long ago. She has 953 victories in a career that has spanned 30 years.</p>
        <p>''Of course, the woman factor comes into it, but I'd just like to be considered a good horse person,'' Ingrassia said. ''I suppose there is some bit of history to it, but I don't think of myself as a pioneer. I just think of doing something I love to do. I couldn't imagine doing anything else. It just turns out I'm a woman doing it. I suppose I've been a bit of a trailblazer.</p>
        <p>''Those obstacles are not there anymore. There were tough times when I started out, times when people did not want me around. But those are long gone now.''</p>
        <p>Goalfish, trained by Ingrassia's husband, Frank, did not race last year because of throat ulcers. Surgery was considered for Goalfish, but the Ingrassias opted to rest the colt. That proved to be the cure.</p>
        <p>He became the first horse since 1991 to capture the Trot after sitting out the 2-year-old campaign. He earned $172,702 tonight and returned $28.20 on a $2 bet to win.</p>
        <p>Goalfish, a 3-year-old colt with just $28,809 in career earnings entering this race, showed the inclination for a late run in the Yonkers Trot eliminations last week, making up 4 lengths in the stretch to finish in a dead heat with Armbro Trick.</p>
        <p>Tonight Goalfish watched the competition fade one by one. Master Lavac, who was the leading trotting 2-year-old colt last year, led at the quarter in 282 5  seconds and still held the advantage at the half in 582 5 . By the three-fourths pole, Approved Action had moved convincingly in front, but after a wire-to-wire victory in the eliminations last week, the colt could not hold the lead as Goalfish charged by.</p>
        <p>''We kept him eligible for this race even though he did not race last year,'' Ingrassia said. ''He got sick and he wasn't real good. I had my doubts. But we still kept the payments up because it seemed like a winnable race. I like to drive on a half-mile track, and most of the top horses tend not to race on the half-mile. This colt is just getting better and better. He's turned into quite a nice colt.''</p>
