        <p>THE entrance to the Costco Wholesale warehouse in Yonkers is stacked high with luggage, lawn chairs and portable radios. But just inside, a jewelry counter appears, and there, from atop the display case, comes a warm red glow: a Cartier box cradling a $4,500 man's Pasha watch.</p>
        <p>Intrigued, shoppers search the store for more luxury brands: on the cookware aisle, a set of Calphalon pots and pans that might be sold at Bloomingdale's, priced 20 percent less; among the sheets and bedspreads, 250-thread count cotton sheets that would sell for $100 at Bloomingdale's, for $42.99, and down pillows for $38.99.</p>

        <p>THE entrance to the Costco Wholesale warehouse in Yonkers is stacked high with luggage, lawn chairs and portable radios. But just inside, a jewelry counter appears, and there, from atop the display case, comes a warm red glow: a Cartier box cradling a $4,500 man's Pasha watch.</p>
        <p>Intrigued, shoppers search the store for more luxury brands: on the cookware aisle, a set of Calphalon pots and pans that might be sold at Bloomingdale's, priced 20 percent less; among the sheets and bedspreads, 250-thread count cotton sheets that would sell for $100 at Bloomingdale's, for $42.99, and down pillows for $38.99.</p>
        <p>The success of wholesale clubs is largely attributable to the ''treasure hunt,'' industry executives say. ''People want something they can talk about,'' said Eileen Kirrane, director of investor relations for BJ's Wholesale Club.</p>
        <p>The strategy behind these clubs has been to use their buying power to offer everything at the lowest price. Now the clubs are taking that to the next level: luxury.</p>
        <p>From watches and jewelry to gourmet goods and fresh foods, the clubs are competing on quality as much as price. Costco, BJ's and Sam's Club have all found that stocking one-time specials on top-end brands, like Coach handbags or Tag Heuer watches, increases traffic.</p>
        <p>''We may only be able to put 20 in each store, but people will hear about it, and they'll keep coming back to see if we have it  again,'' explained Richard Galanti, Costco's chief financial officer. But happenstance  luxury isn't enough, so the retailers have made an effort to upgrade their offerings in brands and quality and compete not just with Kmart and A.&amp;P. but also with Bloomingdale's and Zabar's.</p>
        <p>In Westchester, the demand for luxury goods is greater than in the average market. Costco stocks more luxury goods in its Yonkers and New Rochelle stores than in the average warehouse store and sells out faster. BJ's in Yorktown Heights boasts Prada and Fendi handbags and accessories, priced 25 to 45 percent below retail.</p>
        <p>But the commitment to luxury is not limited to the one-time-only specials. It is found among the mix of goods on the shelves and on items in nearly all categories. Costco offers items like a set of eight Reidel crystal wineglasses for $74.99; a queen set of Ralph Lauren floral sheets for $39.79, and CK Calvin Klein jeans for $24.99.</p>
        <p>To step up its commitment to quality and luxury, Sam's Club has revamped its Elmsford store, part of a corporate strategy to upgrade its clubs. The renovation included installing a bakery, a butcher shop, a pharmacy and a one-hour photo shop.</p>
        <p>''This is to get members coming into the store more frequently,'' said Celia Swanson, Sam's Club's senior vice president of membership. The company has upgraded not only the brands it offers but also the quality of much of its merchandise. Sam's Club will soon introduce a full line of Maytag appliances, and a revamped jewelry section with an upscale selection is due in February.</p>
        <p>Historically, wholesale clubs have been the opposite of luxury, epitomizing ''big box'' retailing. Housed in cavernous buildings totaling 100,000 square feet or more, the concept was developed to cater to small businesses and consumers who bought large lots of basic goods.</p>
        <p>Much of that formula still exists; the warehouses can require an hour or more for browsing; to truly shop a club can take twice as long. The design is rustic retail, with exposed pipes, concrete floors, and lights suspended 30 feet overhead.</p>
        <p>Each club charges a membership fee, ranging from about $35 a year for a basic membership to $100 annually for a premium card, which brings with it additional advantages, like discounted phone service, a roadside assistance plan and mail-order prescriptions.</p>
        <p>The wholesale club concept has proved hugely popular. The top three national clubs -- Costco, Sam's Club and BJ's -- generated $51.4 billion in sales in 1999, with more than $350 million of that in Westchester.</p>
        <p>The average customer spends about $100 a trip, $60 or so of that on groceries, the rest on hard goods and seasonal items. Costco will open its third store in the county in Port Chester next year, and BJ's is currently searching for a site for a second Westchester store.</p>
        <p>A key part of the success is in private-label products, or store brands. While private-label products are more commonly thought of as grocery items, wholesale clubs have sought to increase the number of bigger-ticket items. Each has contracted with manufacturers to produce products similar in design and quality to top national brands.</p>
        <p>As a result, items like barbecue grills and sateen sheets are offered at half the national brand's retail price. Sam's Club sells a line of premium cookware comparable to Calphalon for $199.99. Costco sells Kirkland Signature ladies' cashmere cardigans for $45.99. BJ's this fall will introduce down comforters priced from $79.99 to $119.99.</p>
        <p>Costco attributes 12 percent of its annual sales to its private-label business; for BJ's private-label sales are about 4 percent, but the company expects that amount to grow steadily. And Sam's Club has stepped up efforts to produce more private-label goods.</p>
        <p>The move to higher quality is also reflected in the grocery area. Costco's buyers shop stores like Dean &amp; De Luca and Stew Leonard's for the latest offerings, then find manufacturers to produce similar products, packaged in bulk.</p>
        <p>The result includes things like fresh roasted chickens, herbed goat cheese, sun-dried tomato spread, ready-to-grill salmon ''Milano'' and lobster ravioli, $10.69 for a 36-ounce package. There are tasting stations promoting items, a bakery that fills each store with the aroma of cakes and cinnamon buns and a butcher shop.</p>
        <p>Then there are the cases of paper towels and soda, the staples on which the clubs were born. Prices for these goods are virtually the same from one club to another.  Huggies diapers, for instance, are priced 15 percent less than at A.&amp;P. But there are good, and great, values: a case of Coca-Cola  sells for about 22 percent less; Tide sells for 42 percent less. And while Costco and Sam's Club tend to sell only the top two brands in each category, BJ's offers the top four or five and often has more low-fat or reduced-fat items than the other clubs.</p>
        <p>With some items, especially watches and jewelry, it may be hard to tell how good a deal is: price comparisons with department stores can be difficult. While Costco's selection of Tag Heuer watches seemed to be a good value, they were largely last year's models. All three clubs carry a variety of name-brand watches, gold and diamond jewelry, as well as other gemstones and pearls.</p>
        <p>The clubs are also trying to offer improved service.</p>
        <p>Sam's Club recently introduced a line-buster strategy in which employees scan the items in a shopper's cart, reducing time spent at the register. The clubs also have food courts, travel services and some degree of car care, and Costco and Sam's Club each have a pharmacy and a one-hour photo service. Costco and BJ's each have an optical shop. BJ's even has a branch of the Yonkers Savings and Loan Association.</p>
