        <p>If Bill and Joan Hayes's five acres of grapes were any closer to the water, they would float away.</p>
        <p>The Hayeses own the tiny Cape May Winery and Vineyard, whose fruit is grown at the southern tip of New Jersey about two miles from Delaware Bay to the west, and a mile and a half from the Atlantic to the east.</p>
        <p>This peninsular setting, with the waters tempering the climate year round, is ideal for grapes, most of which Mr. Hayes has planted since 1992.</p>
        <p>The winery, bonded in 1995, is the very definition of a boutique: 1,000 cases yearly, made in the basement of the Hayeses' home, sold only out the front door and in three Cape May restaurants: Oyster Bay Steak and Seafood, the Peter Shields Inn and Godmother's Italian Restaurant.</p>
        <p>It's easy to see why. As Mr. Hayes puts it, ''Godmother's sells about 15 cases of my wine a week, and it's only a little restaurant.'' He's a good winemaker.</p>
        <p>Four reds, sampled this week, are tasty. One, the quaffable '98 cabernet franc ($20), won a gold medal in this year's New Jersey wine competition. Bursting with exuberant flavor -- Beaujolais bounce and Loire fruitiness -- it was my favorite. (The '97 cabernet franc, luscious, meaty and brooding, won't be released until 2001.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Hayes's young, expansive, full-bodied '97 Barrel Reserve Aged cabernet sauvignon ($15) shows anise in the aroma and minty notes in the flavor. His '98 cabernet sauvignon ($10), young and hinting at complexity, is fairly light-bodied and needs beef as a complement.</p>
        <p>He also makes merlot, a barrel-fermented chardonnay, a chardonnay in stainless steel, a riesling and Victorian Blush, a sweet ros'e that mimics white zinfandel and is a blend of riesling, chardonnay and chambourcin.</p>
        <p>The winery, 709 Townbank Road, Cape May, (609) 884-1169, fax (609) 884-5131, can be visited by appointment only.</p>
