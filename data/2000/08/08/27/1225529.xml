        <p>A SIGN just off the exit ramp of the Palisades Interstate Parkway leading to this Bergen County community reads, ''The Billion Dollar Mile.'' That's the name given to the stretch of Route 9W that cuts through the borough and that is lined with corporate campuses nestled in the Palisades Cliffs.</p>
        <p>Now Mayor Joseph Parisi says he intends to change the sign to ''The Trillion Dollar Mile,'' in part because of the anticipated arrival of a new corporate citizen: CNBC, the business cable news network that is a sister network of NBC. CNBC will be relocating from neighboring Fort Lee to a 500,000-square-foot headquarters complex to be built in two phases on a 22-acre site along the highway, which is also known as Sylvan Avenue.</p>
        <p>Site work for the first phase, a 300,000-square-foot three-story building, is scheduled to start next month and the building is expected to be completed in 18 to 24 months.</p>
        <p>''The vision for this new facility is that it will house the CNBC not of the year 2002 but of 2010 and beyond,'' said Bill Bolster, the network's president. He added that it would also accommodate cable affiliate services as well as CNBC.com, the network's Internet companion, formed in 1999. CNBC 2, a new network now in development, will eventually be housed there too.</p>
        <p>The proposed sign change, Mr. Parisi said, also reflects Citibank's relocation of its  scattered computer operations to a technical administration center it created in the  400,000-square-foot former Prentice-Hall building on Sylvan Avenue two and a half years ago. Other corporate tenants along the corridor include Thomas J. Lipton Inc. and Best Foods.</p>
        <p>CNBC's move involves one of the largest  construction projects in nearly two decades in this two-square-mile community of 5,700 people a few miles north of the George Washington Bridge. The project is estimated to cost $120 million to $140 million.</p>
        <p>In a deal that closed earlier this month, the project will be owned by CNBC and developed in concert with Commercial Developments International/East Inc., or CDI/East, of Manhattan. The company sold the network the two parcels that make up the 22-acre site, which is at the highest point in Englewood Cliffs. CDI/East, which will also construct the core and shell of the initial 300,000-square-foot building, is a subsidiary of Kajima Real Estate Development Inc., whose parent is the Kajima Corporation, a Toyko-based engineering, architectural and development company.</p>
        <p>THE building will rise on the former 15-acre site of Lever Brothers, a subsidiary of Unilever United States, the maker of such products as Whisk detergent and Good Humor ice cream. The company, which is downsizing, vacated the 87,000-square-foot two-story building on the site last fall and sold it to CDI/East, said Joseph J. Garibaldi IV, a senior vice president at the Garibaldi Group, a real estate services firm in Chatham that represented Lever Brothers in the sale.</p>
        <p>The second, 200,000-square-foot phase of CNBC's project will take shape on the adjacent seven-acre property, which CDI already owned. The 63,500-square-foot building that now stands on the site is leased to  Kajima Real Estate Development, which will vacate the building by year's end, said Alan T. Kessler, the president of CDI/East.</p>
        <p>Once completed, the CNBC project, which has all of approvals in place, will generate $1 million a year in tax revenue for the borough, Mr. Parisi said.</p>
        <p>Since CNBC began in 1989 and merged two years later with Financial News Network it has been located at 2200 Fletcher Avenue in Fort Lee, where it occupies 149,000 square feet on several floors. But over the years CNBC has grown -- the number of its employees has risen to 800 from 150 -- launching it on a campaign about 18 months ago to find more space.</p>
        <p>Early on, the company looked at Manhattan and was courted by the developer Donald Trump, who wanted it to relocate to his 1.3 million-square-foot building at 40 Wall Street in the city's financial district.</p>
        <p>''We did have conversations about 40 Wall Street,'' Mr. Bolster said. But when employees were surveyed and presented with the options of going to Manhattan or staying in New Jersey, he said, ''a super majority, over 80 percent, said to stay in New Jersey.''</p>
        <p>And what of the difference in rent for space in Manhattan, which is about double that in eastern Bergen County where Englewood Cliffs is situated? Mr. Bolster said his company never reached the point of a cost analysis.</p>
        <p>Moreover, he said, ''with everything going on with the Internet, physical location is becoming less and less important to our industry and others.''</p>
        <p>CNBC's business is not only New York or the United States, but Europe and Asia, he said, ''so the notion we have to be near Nasdaq or the Stock Exchange is not relevant.''</p>
        <p>Once the decision to stay in New Jersey was made, there were rumors the company would join MSNBC, its sister cable network, in Secaucus. But CNBC wanted to stay within a five-mile radius of its present location and to find existing space to remodel or land on which to build.</p>
        <p>Not an easy task in the eastern Bergen County office market where, Mr. Garibaldi said, large blocks of contiguous space of 100,000 square feet or more are scarce and development sites are even scarcer.</p>
        <p>The vacancy rate in eastern Bergen County for Class A space in the second quarter of this year was 12.8 percent, down from 14.9 percent the year before, according to Grubb &amp; Ellis the commercial brokerage company. At the same time average asking rents for such space rose to $28.46 a foot from $27.36, not including electricity.</p>
        <p>CNBC considered expanding within the Fletcher Avenue building or moving to another building in the area, including Fort Lee Executive Park, a two-building office complex with about 600,000 square feet of space just off Route 4 and close to an entrance to the George Washington Bridge. Those options were dropped when the Sylvan Avenue site became available, said Ken Wilkey, vice president of engineering operations and facilities for CNBC.</p>
        <p>''One of our biggest problems was that we were squeezing a major network in an office building, so with remodeling we would have wound up battling the same problem,'' Mr. Wilkey said. ''It made sense to build from the ground up and build a facility to meet our needs.'' That way, he added, ''we control our destiny and have control over our environment.''</p>
        <p>The company's initial search for land was unsuccessful. So ''when this deal was brought to me,'' Mr. Bolster said, ''I was excited about the opportunity.''</p>
        <p>THE opportunity came when the Lever Brothers site came onto the market last summer. As one of the last prime pieces of real estate available just four miles from the bridge the site drew a great deal of interest before it was sold to CDI/ East, Mr. Garibaldi, the broker, said. The sale price was just under $10 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kessler of CDI said he bought the site, which was adjacent to seven acres his company already owned, with the initial idea of developing an office park. But he said his company, aware of CNBC's search for a new headquarters location, approached the network about the site, the upshot of which is the current project. HLW International of Manhattan is the project's architect.</p>
        <p>As now envisioned, the initial 300,000-square-foot glass and steel building is ''a technological-type building that will fit well into the area,'' Mr. Wilkey said. It will include offices, technical support space and  a newsroom as well as a fitness center and cafeteria. There will also be a heliport on the site. The shell of the building is to be completed by next June, with occupancy expected the following year.</p>
        <p>The second, 200,000-square-foot phase of the project will be developed according to the company's growth needs, Mr. Wilkey said. But given its current space squeeze, he added, the company may use the existing building on that site until the new headquarters is completed.</p>
