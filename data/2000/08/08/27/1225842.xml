        <p>The mastery of Orlando Hernandez is fragile, each part of his pitching reliant on the other parts, like a house built with posts and beams. Take away his slider or changeup and the structure of his game falls apart. His fastball looks meaty and mediocre, hitters hammer him.</p>
        <p>Operating along this fine line, Hernandez is in the process of reassembling all of these pieces and recreating the pitcher who dominated in the postseason the last two years. His progression may be the Yankees' most critical issue in the last five weeks of the regular season -- beyond the clinching of a playoff berth -- and Hernandez pitched effectively today, striking out a season-high 11 over seven innings in a 10-6 demolition of the Oakland Athletics.</p>
        <p>Center fielder Bernie Williams made his first start in a week and drove in the Yankees' first run with an infield single, Clay Bellinger hit two triples and had three runs batted in and Jose Canseco played left field for the first time since July 9, 1999, and slammed a tremendous home run. The Yankees led, 10-3, going into the bottom of the ninth, before reliever Mike Stanton allowed a three-run homer; Stanton has allowed homers in each of his last four outings, after surrendering just one in his first 55 appearances.</p>
        <p>The Yankees are 71-55, three games ahead of Boston.The Red Sox won at Kansas City, 5-3, tonight.</p>
        <p>Hernandez won the only pivotal game the Yankees played in 1998, beating Cleveland in Game 4 of the American League Championship Series to even that series at 2-2, and he was extraordinary again in the postseason last fall, establishing himself as the Yankees' ace. But that presence escaped him in the middle of this season. Disabled for almost a month with elbow and back trouble, Hernandez lost his first three starts after being activated Aug. 6, resembling in no way the pitcher the Yankees have come to trust.</p>
        <p>He seemed disconsolate on the mound, sullen; he had no swagger, exuded no confidence or combativeness. After a particularly bad start in Anaheim, Hernandez said repeatedly that he had no understanding of why he was having such trouble.</p>
        <p>All that changed today. Teammates noticed he had regained his steady stride, that same gait possessed by Michael Jordan. When he allowed hits, he kept his head up. ''He was more relaxed today,'' said Jorge Posada, his catcher.</p>
        <p>A teammate said recently that Hernandez had appeared more content lately, possibly because he's feeling truly healthy for the first time in months. His back sometimes aches -- recently, Hernandez brought a chiropractor into the Yankees' clubhouse, only to have him ejected by club officials -- but not to the point that he cannot function on the mound. Todo bien, he has told Manager Joe Torre: everything is fine.</p>
        <p>Everything has to be fine, because Hernandez cannot win with only one pitch, the way Roger Clemens can be successful on a given night with just his fastball. El Duque needs all of his parts working together.</p>
        <p>Hernandez has regained his fastball. Playing right field today, Bellinger had no access to a radar gun, but he could tell El Duque was throwing much harder. The radar guns consistently clocked Hernandez's fastball at 92 to 93 miles an hour, readings that are as good or better than any he has had since he joined the Yankees. Empowered by the six runs his teammates scored against  Mark Mulder (7-10) in the first three innings, Hernandez (10-10) challenged the Athletics with high fastballs, blowing away Mike Stanley, whiffing Miguel Tejada and catcher Ramon Hernandez.</p>
        <p>El Duque greatly complicated matters for the Athletics by mixing his changeup and curveball against lefties and his slider against right-handed batters.</p>
        <p>Hernandez rarely threw his changeup in his first outings after coming off the disabled list, shaking off Posada when the catcher called for it. But Hernandez featured the changeup extensively today, using it to strike out Jason Giambi in the third inning, keeping left fielder Ben Grieve off balance in the first inning. ''We really wanted to use the changeup a lot more,'' Posada said.</p>
        <p>Like David Cone, Hernandez has had trouble maintaining a good slider this season. They use the same grip, possess similar styles, and have talked about this pitch. Hernandez has thrown a sweeping slider in the past, but he is trying to refine its movement: he wants the break on it to come late, sharp and hard.</p>
        <p>In the first few innings today, Hernandez had trouble keeping his slider close enough to the plate to entice right-handed batters. But Hernandez found his slider in the middle innings.</p>
        <p>He spun it against the right-handed hitter Randy Velarde, the pitch veering quickly and with a downward trajectory, fooling Velarde completely. Hernandez threw a few more sliders like this, generating a couple of more strikeouts with it.</p>
        <p>Torre mostly was pleased with Hernandez's outing, but when nudged, he pointed out that Hernandez had thrown so many pitches -- a whopping 134 in seven innings, an indication that the right-hander does not have total command yet. But there is time. What Hernandez needs, Posada said, is one more big start, one more big-time outing to reset his foundation for the fall.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>CHUCK KNOBLAUCH most likely will miss a day or two, after having his left knee bruised by an inside fastball during a minor league game Friday. Knoblauch will play a few more games in the minors and, assuming he does not have any major setbacks, it is expected that he will be activated when the major league rosters expand Sept. 1. Knoblauch, out with a sore elbow, has not played since Aug. 2. . . . DAVID CONE is 3-11, and if the Yankees hold their lead in the American League East, a decision must be made whether to keep him on the postseason roster. Leaving Cone off the roster would be tough for Manager JOE TORRE. ''Emotionally, it would,'' he said. ''Then you have to do what you think is the right thing for the situation, and I'm glad we're not having to make that decision now. He brings so much to the table:  the experience, the know-how. No matter who is left off, it's going to be difficult.''</p>
