        <p>TODAY'S ballet world has two poles, and both are in danger of freezing over. Plotless, or abstract, ballets are at one pole; narrative ballets are at the other.</p>
        <p>It could be argued that because there are two different but valid types of ballet, each would theoretically complement the other, thereby enriching company repertories. Unfortunately, however, both abstract and dramatic works often suffer from a deadly chill.</p>
        <p>These days, abstract ballets dominate many repertories. It was George Balanchine who popularized the genre. Indeed, his abstractions proved so remarkable that during the 50's and 60's some dancegoers argued that it was aesthetically necessary for ballet to discard plot and characterization, just as certain artistic and musical authorities had argued that painting was destined to become abstract and that historical necessity had propelled music toward serialism.</p>
        <p>At their weakest, abstract painting and serial music developed academic conventions. So, too, at times has abstract ballet. Thus one currently popular choreographic recipe seems to be: Take a piece of classical music and plow your way through it with fast steps to the allegros and slow ones to the adagios. Few choreographers have come close to equaling Balanchine, perhaps because they have failed to realize that his abstractions, though devoid of narrative, can be kinetic revelations of love, longing, fear, struggle and aspiration. In contrast, other abstract choreographers merely string steps together.</p>
        <p>Surely choreographers who have tired of abstractions ought to revel in emotional confrontations, swashbuckling derring-do or comic misadventures. Unfortunately, recent dramatic ballets can be as tepid as the abstractions. One reason is that they tend to be full-evening creations, and the longer they are, the duller they grow.</p>
        <p>In the past season, for instance, American Ballet Theater danced John Cranko's full-evening version of Shakespeare's ''Taming of the Shrew.'' It has boisterously funny moments. It also has lots of choreographic padding and is less ebullient than another Cranko comedy, ''Pineapple Poll,'' a nautical romp in the style of a Gilbert and Sullivan operetta that the Joffrey Ballet used to perform. But ''Pineapple Poll'' is in only one act.</p>
        <p>Too many choreographers now appear to assume that dramatic ballets ought to be multi-act productions. But consider some of the distinguished dramatic pieces of the past century: Michel Fokine's ''Petrouchka,'' ''Firebird'' and ''Scheherazade,'' Leonide Massine's ''Three-Cornered Hat'' and ''St. Francis,'' Balanchine's ''Apollo'' and ''Prodigal Son,'' Ninette de Valois's ''Job,'' Frederick Ashton's ''Wedding Bouquet,'' ''Enigma Variations'' and ''A Month in the Country,'' Antony Tudor's ''Jardin aux Lilas'' and ''Pillar of Fire,'' Eugene Loring's ''Billy the Kid,'' Jerome Robbins's ''Fancy Free,'' and Agnes de Mille's ''Rodeo'' and ''Fall River Legend.'' All are in one act. And their economy helps make them enthralling.</p>
        <p>How many comparably admirable multi-act ballets can be set beside them? The list is ominously short. Some balletomanes might choose ''Romeo and Juliet,'' as choreographed by Ashton, Cranko, Kenneth MacMillan or Leonid Lavrovsky, or Balanchine's adaptation of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream.'' But ''The Dream,'' Ashton's own treatment of that fantasy, is equally worthy -- and in only one act. We also have Ashton's fine personal versions of ''La Fille Mal Gardee,'' an 18th-century comedy, and ''Ondine,'' a 19th-century Romantic ballet. And what else?</p>
        <p>Repertory lists might suggest that a lot else exists. In recent seasons, choreographers have based multi-act works on such literary and historical figures as Cinderella, Camille, Peer Gynt, Anna Karenina, Cleopatra, King Arthur, Peter Pan, the Three Musketeers, the Great Gatsby and Dracula. Shakespeare is always popular source material, ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' and ''Romeo and Juliet'' especially but others as well, including ''Othello.'' Yet the most potent choreographic retelling of that tragedy remains a one-act: Jose Limon's ''Moor's Pavane.'' And once Tudor also created a poignant one-act ''Romeo and Juliet.''</p>
        <p>A curious thing about some of the multi-act productions is how, after receiving their premieres and attracting attention (for they are often scenically elaborate), they soon drop out of repertory. A few return in a season or two, only to vanish once more; many are never seen again. They have had their moments of fame.</p>
        <p>ONE would have to inspect companies around the world to come to a definitive conclusion on this matter, yet it sometimes seems as if choreographers turn to ''Romeo,'' ''Cinderella'' or ''Dracula'' not because they are deeply interested in those characters and their stories but because they think such familiar titles will sell lots of tickets. There's nothing wrong with selling tickets, but marketing should not take precedence over creativity.</p>
        <p>Choreographers should ask themselves, and managing directors and board members should allow them to ask, ''What do I want -- what do I really want -- to do?'' Balanchine's love of bodies moving to music through intricate patterns in time and space gave us ''Agon.'' Tudor's concern for the quiet desperation of lonely people gave us ''Pillar of Fire.'' Both works were considered unconventional when new. Neither is tied to a well-known story or an easily hummable score. But as audiences began to sense their passion and realize their excellence, these ballets grew popular.</p>
        <p>Let marketing experts take care of the marketing. Choreographers burning with passion ought to be encouraged to express that passion in whatever dramatic or abstract form they think appropriate. Otherwise, there may be no thaw at either balletic pole.</p>
