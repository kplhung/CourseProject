His largest investment is a blind trust valued at $100,000 to $250,000, and he has an individual retirement account consisting mainly of government securities valued at $9,000 to $135,000. In 1999, he listed capital gains of $30,000 to $122,000.</p>
        <p>His investment portfolio also lists a Merrill Lynch account owned jointly with his wife, valued at $10,000 to $150,000. It consists of mutual funds and government securities.  He also has bank savings accounts worth  $20,000 to $110,000.</p>
