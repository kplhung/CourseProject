        <p>As anticipated, the Federal Reserve sat on its hands at its policy meeting last week, leaving the equity markets basking in a place they are so far enjoying: interest rate limbo.</p>
        <p>Although there are many dissidents, most analysts seem to think that interest rates will remain where they are until after the presidential election. The economic data, though choppy, has shown the undertow of a slowdown from a brittle pace of growth.</p>
        <p>Last week, the data could only have made the Fed even more comfortable with its rate decision. Gross domestic product data for the second quarter suggested that personal spending and inflation were growing at a moderate pace, while business spending, a key indicator of productivity gains, rose a stunning 14.6 percent. That figure points to further inflation-damping through efficiency advances, a factor the Fed watches closely.</p>
        <p>And the markets seemed to appreciate the indicators as well. All three major stock indexes stepped higher last week, with the Nasdaq jumping 2.9 percent to 4,042.68 points, the Dow industrial average up 1.3 percent to 11,192.63 and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 up 1 percent to 1,506.46. The 30-year bond yield fell 3 basis points to 5.66 percent.</p>
