        <p>A special prosecutor investigating John M. Deutch, the former director of central intelligence, has told law enforcement officials that he is wrapping up his inquiry and expects to recommend that Mr. Deutch be prosecuted on charges of mishandling classified information, government officials said today.</p>
        <p>The prosecutor, Paul E. Coffey, has not yet made any recommendations to Attorney General Janet Reno, the officials said. But Mr. Coffey, who was brought out of retirement for the Deutch matter, has told others in the Justice Department that he is inclined to conclude that Mr. Deutch be charged with storing government secrets on his home computer, a security violation.</p>
        <p>Ms. Reno initially declined to prosecute Mr. Deutch, who had acknowledged a breach of security and apologized. But she ordered a new inquiry in February after a report from the C.I.A. inspector general questioned how the agency's leadership had handled the matter. In addition, the issue of how Mr. Deutch's case was dealt with drew criticism from Congress and elsewhere for its sharp contrast with the Wen Ho Lee case.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lee, a former scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, is being prosecuted on charges of illegally transferring and copying secret nuclear data from the laboratory, an offense some Justice Department critics have argued is similar to what Mr. Deutch may have done.</p>
        <p>The government officials spoke after Bloomberg News Service first reported on the matter on Friday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Deutch was director of central intelligence from May 1995 until resigning in December 1996. As he was leaving, a C.I.A. computer security official found that he had stored  information at his home, including details of covert operations. The agency's security office began an investigation into whether he had mishandled classified material but that inquiry soon bogged down.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department was not notified that he might have broken any laws until more than a year after the breach was discovered. In 1998, a C.I.A. employee told the inspector general's office that the initial investigation had been improperly handled. The inspector general then opened his own inquiry and notified the Department of Justice.</p>
        <p>Six senior agency officials have been disciplined for their roles in the initial investigation of Mr. Deutch.</p>
