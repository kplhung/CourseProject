        <p>LEFT BACK</p>
        <p>A Century of Failed School Reforms.</p>
        <p>By Diane Ravitch.</p>
        <p>555 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Simon &amp; Schuster. $30.</p>
        <p>Education, at the top, is a very small world, resembling nothing so much as an American high school where rival cliques vie for power and prestige. Everyone knows everyone else, having served at some point on the same blue-ribbon panels, attended the same academic conferences or even taught in the same schools.</p>
        <p>For more than a century, writes Diane Ravitch in her new book, ''Left Back,'' the ''in'' crowd has been the ''progressive'' educators, the inheritors of a tradition that began with John Dewey. In the nation's education schools, particularly Columbia's Teachers College, they are the popular kids, the ones who get invited to the professional equivalent of the prom, hold positions in student government and receive the adulation of their peers (if not necessarily of a wider public). Opposing them has been a smaller band of conservatives who have set up their own clubs and think tanks. The animosity between the two has often rivaled that between the jocks and the nerds.</p>
        <p>In this charged atmosphere, even those who might prefer to carve a middle path are often forced to align themselves with one group or the other, if only for protection. Although Ravitch clearly admires the work of many progressive educators -- Deborah Meier, Howard Gardner and Theodore Sizer are among those she names in ''Left Back'' -- she has often run with the conservatives, serving at one point in the early 1990's as the assistant secretary of education in the Bush administration.</p>
        <p>Consequently, she is often (wrongly) labeled a right-winger and has suffered the casual professional cruelties of being in the unpopular set. In truth, Ravitch strikes me as a very old-fashioned liberal, of a pre-1968, Arthur Schlesinger Jr. bent. She has described herself as both a Democrat and an Independent, yet is not so partisan as to be averse to working with Republicans. Her positions on issues like standards and multiculturalism are far more nuanced than her critics often give her credit for, and she has a talent, as Albert Shanker did, of speaking her mind, irritating friends and foes alike. In the past, she has come out for higher teacher salaries, instead of merit pay, which must have annoyed some of her colleagues on the right, and earlier this year she publicly quit as a consultant to George W. Bush's presidential campaign when he refused to meet with the Log Cabin Republicans.</p>
        <p>Still, there is no denying that Ravitch is a fierce opponent of what she perceives as a virulent anti-intellectual strain in the teachings of dozens of educators whom she describes, somewhat reductively, as ''progressive.'' The history of their ideas is the subject of ''Left Back.'' Ravitch sees the past through the present, and her lens is the current debate over standards and a national curriculum (both of which she supports). Her thesis is that as public school enrollment surged in successive waves after 1900, progressive theorists -- like Edward L. Thorndike, William Heard Kilpatrick and James B. Conant -- repeatedly sought to water down the curriculum by creating ''undemanding vocational, industrial, or general programs'' into which women, blacks and poor immigrants were shunted, all in the name of ''democracy'' and ''meeting the needs of the individual child.''</p>
        <p>Although these progressive ideas took different names and different forms -- the ''child-centered'' movement, the ''social efficiency'' movement, the ''life adjustment'' movement -- they all shared a mistaken belief, Ravitch writes, that the vast majority of students couldn't master the rigorous pre-college curriculum previously offered exclusively to elites. Instead of reducing educational inequality, she argues, such reforms actually served to aggravate racial and social stratification in the nation's schools at just the moment when universal education was becoming a reality. As Ravitch says, practices now viewed as anathema by progressive educators -- I.Q. testing and grouping children by ability into ''tracks'' -- began as liberal reforms, designed to sort kids into the academic haves and have-nots.</p>
        <p>Not everyone, of course, agreed with these approaches. Some educators -- most prominently, William Chandler Bagley, a proponent of liberal education -- insisted, as early as the 1920's and 30's, that America should offer the same curriculum to all students, no matter what their economic or social background. Yet as Ravitch shows, such egalitarian views were usually denounced as ''conservative'' or ''reactionary'' because the standard academic fare (Latin, algebra, chemistry and the like) was regarded as stultifying and elitist.</p>
        <p>As a matter of theory, Ravitch's case against progressives is persuasive. ''Time and again,'' she writes, ''experts urged the schools to de-emphasize reading, writing, history, mathematics and science; to drop foreign languages; to replace history with social studies; to eliminate high-quality literature and substitute for it uninspired scraps from textbooks; and to teach only what was useful and immediately functional.'' Her method is to hang prominent theorists with their own words -- often citing excessively long passages from their writings (to avoid, I suspect, charges of quoting out of context) -- as they describe, in sometimes shockingly undemocratic terms, how the country's ''army of incapables'' can't be expected to achieve even basic literacy or numeracy. Those most hurt by these ideas, she argues, were disadvantaged children who had ''the greatest need for the intellectual stimulation that schools were supposed to provide.''</p>
        <p>As a matter of practice, however, Ravitch is on less secure ground. As she concedes, parents and teachers have always rejected reformers' wackier notions. Periods of innovation have invariably been followed by back-to-basics retrenchment (after Sputnik in the 1950's, and after the ''Nation at Risk'' report in the 1980's, for example). Indeed, as the scholars Larry Cuban and David Tyack have observed, despite the American penchant for educational fads, ''the idea of school'' has remained surprisingly consistent over time (Ravitch even quotes Cuban on this point). And in cities where specific progressive programs were mandated, they have seldom been adopted in ways that their originators intended.</p>
        <p>It's also a little unfair to pin anti-intellectualism in the schools on a small band of theorists ensconced at Teachers College. Anti-intellectualism has always been a feature of American life, arguably more prevalent on the right than on the left. Its best representative at the moment is probably Governor Bush, who calls for improving schools even as he all but brags that he is stupider than his pointy-headed opponent, Al Gore. And the religious right has done far more, in the name of ''creationism,'' to retard the teaching of science in this country than any progressive curriculum. Similarly, women, blacks and immigrants weren't ''left back'' educationally in the first half of this century solely because a few progressive theorists argued for a diversified curriculum!</p>
        <p>Ravitch's sheer animus against the progressive tradition -- whose very real contributions to education she mentions in passing but never quite acknowledges -- may baffle lay readers. Her book is best understood as a scathing indictment of the ed-school ''in'' crowd, where an atmosphere of what Orwell once called ''orthodoxy-sniffing'' -- sniff, sniff, are you a good progressive educator?'' -- has predominated. If Ravitch is too pessimistic, it's perhaps because she has spent too much time in this dispiriting world.</p>
        <p>But instead of ''A Century of Failed School Reforms,'' she might have subtitled her book ''The Triumph of American Education.'' For as her old mentor, the pre-eminent scholar Lawrence A. Cremin, once observed, ''Popular education . . . is as radical an ideal as Americans have embraced. It is by its very nature fraught with difficulty, and the institutions we have established to achieve it are undeniably flawed. Yet it is important to be aware of what has been accomplished.''</p>
        <p>Since 1900, we have gone from educating a tiny elite group to providing true universal education to most Americans through high school. No country in the world tries to educate a greater portion of its children, or for longer, than the United States. Women, blacks and the poor have not only become essential parts of the public school system but have made great strides. That's not an argument for complacency, but it's worth remembering how far we've come. Ravitch's contribution in ''Left Back'' is to help us realize how far we still have to go.</p>
