        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your article ''On 14th Street, Less Grit, More Glamour'' [Aug. 13]  made no mention of the part that landmarking played in the transformation, a serious oversight -- especially where the street intersects with its major hub, Union Square.</p>
        <p>The eight individually designated buildings around the square, plus those that are part of the Ladies' Mile Historic District, are protected from demolition or unsympathetic alteration and have been successfully adapted to reuses as varied and economically viable as, among other thriving enterprises, two theaters, a giant bookstore, two upscale restaurants, a pet shop, a liquor store and a soon-to-be posh hotel, to say nothing of office buildings and an apartment house.</p>

        <p>Your article ''On 14th Street, Less Grit, More Glamour'' [Aug. 13]  made no mention of the part that landmarking played in the transformation, a serious oversight -- especially where the street intersects with its major hub, Union Square.</p>
        <p>The eight individually designated buildings around the square, plus those that are part of the Ladies' Mile Historic District, are protected from demolition or unsympathetic alteration and have been successfully adapted to reuses as varied and economically viable as, among other thriving enterprises, two theaters, a giant bookstore, two upscale restaurants, a pet shop, a liquor store and a soon-to-be posh hotel, to say nothing of office buildings and an apartment house.</p>
        <p>Credit might also have been given to the Union Square Community Coalition and the Drive to Protect the Ladies' Mile District, two local groups that persuaded the Landmarks Preservation Commission to designate these superb examples of the architecture, culture and shopping milieu from the area's illustrious past.</p>
        <p>The lobbying goes on, for there are other notable buildings that should be protected. Or will we see them suffer the ignoble fate of the late lamented Luchow's, doomed by upzoning to make way for another of New York University's bland behemoths? City authorities deemed development opportunities more important than the preservation of one small ornate 14th Street building that served for 100 years (1882-1982) as the gathering place of New York's great and famous, the movers and shakers of a century more opulent than our own.</p>
