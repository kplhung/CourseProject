        <p>Salvo Galano used to nail a simple burlap canvas on a wall across from a soup kitchen run by the Church of the Holy Apostles in Chelsea. Then the photographer would wait patiently for the homeless men and women who frequented the place to drift over and pose at his makeshift studio.</p>
        <p>Mr. Galano set out on a journey two years ago to show an unseen face of the homeless population in New York City. The 32-year-old Italian photographer was convinced that people in America would be shocked if they saw what he saw on the city sidewalks. He was certain, too, that he would find a publisher for his book, his social document that told a broader truth: that the homeless were not so different from anyone that he knew.</p>
        <p>But by the end of Mr. Galano's journey last month, he was broke, unable to pay the rent on his apartment, living a couple of days here and there with friends. He became a homeless man, in other words, with a cell phone. His book is a dream deferred.</p>
        <p>Every obsession has its risks. Mr. Galano found that he cared, perhaps too much, about a social issue that has persisted for two decades now, so long that it has lost the power to shock. ''Sometimes when I think about what happened in my life, I want to laugh, not to cry,'' Mr. Galano said in a telephone interview from Milan, where he recently returned, after five years in New York, to live with his father, a retired factory worker. ''I had a good career,'' he said. ''All of a sudden, with a fellowship, my life turned to the other side.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Galano was awarded a prestigious fellowship from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation in 1998, which had sponsored some of his role models in photography, Diane Arbus and Robert Frank. He was one of the youngest recipients of what is considered a midcareer fellowship. Mr. Galano invested the entire $35,000 Guggenheim award, in addition to his life savings of $15,000, in the book. He had been dreaming of the project since 1996, when he began to volunteer at the soup kitchen on Ninth Avenue near 28th Street.</p>
        <p>The photographer had no interest in shooting the kind of traditional photographs often seen of homeless people, surrounded by misery and detritus. He had something else in mind, portraits that looked more like fashion photography, taken against a blank canvas. Let the dignity and the humanity of his subjects silently speak volumes.</p>
        <p>It takes a great deal to impress the president of the Guggenheim Foundation, Joel Conarroe. Yet Mr. Conarroe said he was stunned by Mr. Galano's photographs. The foundation's trustees took the unusual step of agreeing to pay a $10,000 subsidy toward the book's publication. ''This was a real work of love,'' said Mr. Conarroe, who spent hours with Mr. Galano, editing his profiles of the homeless. ''The best art results from a combination of passion and genius. A lot of people have passion without the genius, and a lot of people have genius without the passion. This was a true work of art. Some of them look like Renaissance paintings; the way they are posed. People dressed up in whatever they could find that was their best.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Galano's photographs, including some of the homeless, have appeared in leading newspapers and magazines in his native Italy and throughout Europe. But the photographer's work is not so much known here.</p>
        <p>Until a few months ago, Mr. Galano said he believed that he had a publishing deal with the Aperture Foundation in Manhattan. No contract was signed, though. Mr. Galano said Aperture held on to his project for nine months, then sent him an e-mail message stating that editors had decided the book was not marketable. Mr. Galano said he knew the nonprofit foundation was already planning to publish a book, ''Fragile Dwelling,'' due out this fall, by a New York-based photographer, Margaret Morton, who has a reputation for her photographs of the homeless. He said he did not know if that prior commitment had anything to do with Aperture's thinking.</p>
        <p>A publicity assistant at Aperture, Christopher McLane, said the other day that the publication of Ms. Morton's book on the homeless was indeed a factor in the decision to reject Mr. Galano's project. But an Aperture book editor, Phyllis Thompson Reid, later called to say that fatigue with the homeless issue did not play a role and that the two books were considered for two separate publication seasons from the start.</p>
        <p>''We could not do the best by Salvo by publishing this book,'' the editor said. ''Every season, we consider many books. And sometimes, obviously for a complex brew of reasons in any particular case, we will or will not be able to go through with them. I can't make an authoritative statement about exactly what went into every aspect of the decision.''</p>
        <p>In the last two years, friends and colleagues have watched with wonderment as Mr. Galano's book -- called ''Sidewalk Stories'' -- became the focus of his daily routine. He befriended about 15 homeless men and women. Night and day, he was in their company. They preened for him in a small park across from the soup kitchen. The project so consumed the photographer that he gave up other work assignments, maybe even a bit of common sense.</p>
        <p>''Given the circumstances, one might say that it is imprudent, but when you have a passion, you have a passion,'' said Clyde Kuemmerle, programs coordinator for the Church of the Holy Apostles soup kitchen. ''And there he was, with a beautiful representation of people who do live on the streets, and there he was himself, all of a sudden living on the streets.''</p>
