        <p>Sara Rath's album THE COMPLETE PIG: An Entertaining History of Pigs (Voyageur, $29.95) contains enough eccentric pig lore to leave the browser giddy with pleasure. And browsing is in order. While the longer accounts of pigs in history, art and literature are just fine, the reader is constantly delayed by seductive little sidebars, like an entry on singing pigs in the court of Louis XI. (Pigs of assorted sizes and ages were attached to a sort of keyboard; when the keys were pressed, little spikes stabbed the animals, making them vocalize. It seems to have been one of the few things to amuse this 15th-century monarch.) Or instruction on how to say ''oink'' in 19 languages (try ''groin groin'' in French, ''rok-rok'' in Croatian or the unlikely ''buubuu'' in Japanese). Or a list of Italian pig curses, graded by degree of blasphemy (''porca miseria,'' ''pig misery,'' is suitable for use by children). A particularly rich chapter, ''Fairy Pigs, Demon Swine: Folktales, Superstitions and Saints,'' provides a separately boxed story of how St. Anthony Abbot came to have a pig for a pal, thereby qualifying him as the patron of swine and swineherds. The same section also tells us that in some cultures pigs are regarded as such bad news that they cannot even be named -- in some parts of China, the working euphemism is ''long-nosed generals.'' The illustrations, drawn from old posters, drawings and photographs ancient and modern, range from sweetly innocent pink piglets to a terrifyingly fanged wild boar. It is impossible to choose a favorite, but among the species depicted, it is hard to resist the adorably (or horribly) wrinkled Minzhu from China. One supposes that they look as much like long-nosed generals as anything else on God's green earth.</p>
