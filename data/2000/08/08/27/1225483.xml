        <p>Franklin D. Edmonds, James Quillen, Doris Quillen, Atlanta, June 29, 2000</p>
        <p>Franklin D. Edmonds (standing): ''Most people think car salesmen have plaid jackets, white shoes and Elvis hairdos and that they lie. But I talk to customers and find out what's going on and show a little empathy. The Quillens were Christian people, so I let them know that I attribute my success to a higher power. You need to find that common ground. In the car business, you have to build the rapport before you go for the jugular.''</p>
        <p>James Quillen (driver's seat): 'My wife doesn't know a whole lot about cars, but she knows about the money end of things. She talks tough. She kept saying, 'I'm not going over this price.' Don't get me wrong -- we are not one of these families that have separate checking accounts. Money is a joint decision. She'll say she did most of the talking, but we both did.''</p>

        <p>Doris Quillen (passenger's seat): ''All my adult life I've hated buying cars -- all this business of going back and forth. Maybe men like this haggling. It makes them feel like they are really smart and they've gotten a good deal. But I just want them to tell me how much it costs. In the first place, I know nothing about cars. I hate that. And I think I'm prejudiced against men. They don't listen to women. This time it really was refreshing. Franklin understood that I was serious. I told him exactly what I wanted and what I wanted to pay for it. I did all the talking. My husband mainly just listened. Women are the ones who control the money. Not every man will admit it. I think my husband would say we share in it.''</p>
