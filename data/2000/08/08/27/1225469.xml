        <p>IT'S a good thing the sidewalks are cement,'' observed the stranger as I passed him on Main Street.</p>
        <p>I looked at him inquiringly. ''Or they'd be rolled up!'' he explained, guffawing.</p>
        <p>He had a point. Apart from him, his wife and me, only a single family strolled down the main drag of Baker City, Ore., at six o'clock on a Sunday evening in July. Possibly all the inhabitants were at dinner. That didn't prevent me from admiring the dignified Victorian buildings -- banks, hotels, homes -- that had been erected in the raw Wild West, and were now flanked by broad leafy streets and backed by the ragged Blue Mountains. The town of 10,000 in this northeastern corner of Oregon is quiet now, even bucolic, but it wasn't always that way.</p>
        <p>I was on a three-day exploratory jaunt through the Blue Mountains, a range so variously defined that even many Oregonians have never heard of it -- though you'd think the mountains would be hard to ignore, rising to more than 9,000 feet. Geologically, they are considered to spread from the snow-capped Wallowas near the Idaho border to the gentle Ochocos in central Oregon. But in popular parlance, they extend simply from the Washington line south to Baker City, where they are sometimes called the Elkhorns. This semantic confusion tends to keep them terra incognita outside the state, which is not all bad.</p>
        <p>The first people besides the resident  American Indian population to pass this way in any numbers were the Oregon Trail emigrants, who must have been relieved to find this watered valley after their desert crossing. Then gold was discovered in the 1860's. An enterprising settler built a toll road from the Oregon Trail to the Powder River running below the mountain range, and Baker City was born. It grew to serve the miners and the ranchers who followed -- and a rowdy bunch they must have been.  The railroad came through in 1884, bringing in the merchants who built dignified monuments to prosperity on the frontier.</p>
        <p>In one of these, the Geiser Grand Hotel, I found my supper. The Geiser was built in 1889. Sitting prominently on a corner in the center of town it featured the most modern innovations, including electricity and even an elevator. The spacious dining room retains an aura of relaxed elegance, and the menu concentrates on steaks and Northwestern fish. I had a yen for fish and chips, and theirs turned out to be pleasantly light, so I followed it with a piece of chocolate-hazelnut torte.</p>
        <p>Replete, I returned to the Grant House Bed-and-Breakfast, which I'd selected at random upon arrival (it is currently closed while the owner, Diane Pearson, is on an extended trip to Russia). Grant House too dates from the 1880's. Ms. Pearson, a school librarian, has brought in some family heirlooms: a floral wool carpet and her childhood piano, which with the solid Mission-style furniture and myriad Russian nesting  dolls, or matryoshki, create a calm, welcoming atmosphere. The three cozy guest rooms upstairs are named after local mines; Ms. Pearson had just returned from Siberia with the dolls and a Russian exchange student -- gratifying to me as a former teacher of Russian -- and we all had a jolly conversation over a pot of tea.</p>
        <p>It was so comfortable I found it hard to leave, but the mountains were calling; and I did, after a breakfast of fresh fruit and homemade muffins. First I decided to see the mountains as the early emigrants would have, from the National Historic Oregon Trail Interpretive Center just east of town.</p>
        <p>The rounded hills east of Baker City are barren and dry, enlivened only by black rock and sagebrush -- not too different from the previous several hundred miles the pioneers would already have endured. Some of the early diarists note their poor impression of fabled Oregon. The interpretive center,  opened in 1992, sits on Flagstaff Hill just above a section of the old trail, whose ruts are visible in the sand.</p>
        <p>Inside, the main exhibits lead the visitor along a path featuring scenes of life on the 2,000-mile trek. Actual diary entries and explanatory plaques detail the realities of the journey, and the hardships. Of these, disease and accidents were the worst: in some years, 10 percent of emigrants died on the trail.</p>
        <p>Outside, the Blue Mountains rose impressively behind a wagon encampment, where a volunteer in pioneer costume offered me a biscuit freshly baked in campfire embers.  The old trail was a pencil line through the sagebrush below.</p>
        <p>The sun was already hot, but I decided to walk down along the four-mile interpretive path loop. Signs advise the visitor to wear a hat and carry water. Sage thrashers and families of grasshopper sparrows quarreled in the brush. On the valley floor a replica covered wagon stood beside a scrap of original trail. One could imagine thirsty emigrants trudging through, gazing at the evergreen-clad mountains and goading their oxen on, hoping to make camp along the cool and leafy Powder River. They would have passed here in late summer or early fall, when the desert was at its hottest and driest.</p>
        <p>They would have proceeded northwest past the town of La Grande, aiming for the pass at Blue Mountain Crossing. I, having the luxury of a car and paved roads, would follow a somewhat different route.</p>
        <p>Two of Oregon's Scenic Byways join to provide a driver's view -- a brief sketch, as it were -- of these mountains. The tour is about 145 miles long, and as it connects with I-84 at either end, it's possible to do a loop: explore the highlands, then return on the Interstate to visit the few small cities -- Pendleton, La Grande, Baker City -- strung on it like beads on a chain.</p>
        <p>Starting off, I drove 12 miles north to Haines to catch the northern end of the Elkhorn Scenic Byway (Forest Service Road 73). It looped up through farm and meadow and forests of vanilla-scented ponderosa pine, and soon I was driving through thick, solemn stands of spruce and fir. The air, decidedly hot down on the plain, was aromatic and fresh. There was hardly another vehicle on the road.</p>
        <p>About 18 miles on I came to Anthony Lake, wrapped in firs and pine at 7,100 feet. In winter a modest ski resort opens here to accommodate the cognoscenti familiar with the area's dry powder. Now, on the Fourth of July weekend, the campground was just opening for the season. A couple of dozen people lolled about the pocket-mirror alpine lake -- fishing, picnicking or gently floating in rubber rafts. Across the water rose the cone of Gunsight Mountain.</p>
        <p>I observed snow melting into rivulets feeding the lake and decided it was not time for a swim. Indeed, some of the picnic tables were still neatly ensconced in snowbanks. But cloudless skies invited a walk on the graveled milelong circumference trail. Tiny wild violets bloomed beside the path. I passed quiet children and quieter fishermen (everyone here seemed to be serene); sat on a rock and watched trout jumping; and on completing the circle, stretched out lazily in the sun.</p>
        <p>Driving again, along the switchbacky mountain road, I skirted the North Fork John Day Wilderness Area -- 170,000 acres of uninhabited forest, canyon and lake. Many trails thread through this primitive area, including the 23-mile North Fork John Day River Trail through the canyon, and the equally long Elkhorn Crest Trail. A few old miners' cabins are handy in case of inclement weather. I had to come back here, I decided, cut loose from the car and dive into the magnificent wilderness.</p>
        <p>But my time now was limited. I joined the Blue Mountains Scenic Byway at Forest Service Road 53 and paused at the Bridge Creek Wildlife Area. The Forest Service acquired this tract of meadow and open woods as a winter feeding range for elk (the elk were using it anyway, annoying the ranchers). Up a short trail, a stand of pines overlooked hundreds of square miles of the John Day River drainage.</p>
        <p>It was late in the afternoon. A bluish haze hung over the valley. The sun beat down, raising a sweet-oniony smell from the hundreds of mariposa lilies in bloom. I bent down to sniff one, and discovered a tiny azure butterfly inside, which was immediately joined by another. For half an hour I soaked in the sun and silence.</p>
        <p>PRESENTLY it dawned on me that, not having brought a tent, I would have to find a place to sleep. I meandered on a few miles to the hamlet of Ukiah, population 245. A month earlier the town would have been ringed with meadows of blue camas flowers, whose roots were a traditional Indian staple.</p>
        <p>Ukiah lies in a saucer-shaped depression between mountains and looks like the set for an episode of ''Wyatt Earp.'' The short main street is flanked by low plank buildings -- a couple of general stores, a cafe, a Mexican restaurant -- and the Antlers Inn. The sides of the inn were literally covered with antlers of deer, elk, moose and even caribou, reminding me that here big game is plentiful and hunters even more so. Rough wooden signs offered ''Rooms'' and ''Drop-In Showers, $5.00.'' It looked intriguing, but no one answered my knock.</p>
        <p>Slowly I followed the rushing Grande Ronde River 35 miles down on Route 244 to the town of La Grande. On I-84 I turned northwest, following the approximate route of the emigrants' crossing amid a wagon train of semis. At the top of the pass, a herd of elk browsed along the highway -- their summer feeding grounds?</p>
        <p>Suddenly, as if a curtain had dropped, the panorama of a blood-red sunset on the vast brown Columbia Plateau opened up -- a sobering view for weary pioneers. Soon I pulled into the city of Pendleton and checked into the clean but plain Vagabond Inn (a motel that has since changed hands and is now called the Economy Inn).</p>
        <p>East of Pendleton on the Umatilla Indian Reservation is the new Tamastslikt Cultural Institute. The museum, right next to the Wildhorse Casino Resort, was opened in 1998 by the Cayuse, Walla Walla and Umatilla tribes. It's the newest of the five Oregon Trail Centers, and its focus is the culture of the Columbia Plateau tribes and the Oregon Trail's impact upon them.</p>
        <p>Early the next morning I drove out to the reservation. The round wood-and-stone museum stands on a level plain fronting the foothills. Within, a temporary exhibition hall contained children's illustrations -- some on brown paper cut to the shape of a deer hide -- of Indian folk tales. In the main halls the coyote materializes as a silhouette on walls and in folk stories emanating from tape players, running like a spirit guide through the tribes' story.</p>
        <p>Replicas of a winter lodge, an early missionary church and a trading fort anchor the narrative. The history winds through the introduction of the horse, the trappers and missionaries, then the huge influx of settlers and confinement to reservations. It was interesting to trace the changes in tools, dress and ornaments: from the traditional stone, bone, shell and hide, to glass beads obtained through trade with the Spanish and English, to woven cloth and metal goods.</p>
        <p>Noteworthy, too, was how these Old World goods were adapted:  beads, for instance, being worked in native and French-influenced patterns not only for personal adornment but also for decorating the horses of which the Northwest tribes were so passionately fond. Exhibits on the present and future of the tribes cover Indian salmon recovery projects, efforts for economic growth, and hopes for the future.</p>
        <p>Two things made a strong impression on this particular visitor. First,  learning that the horse, so dramatically involved with the economy, culture and mythology of the tribes, only reached the Columbia Plateau in the early 1700's. The famous Nez Perce horse-breeders noted in the journals of Lewis and Clark had had just a century to hone their skills.</p>
        <p>Second, the process by which the original 800-square-mile Umatilla Reservation was reduced to the present 172,000 acres, or 269 square miles, as the settlers' hunger for farmland grew. First acreages were simply whittled away; then came ''allotment,'' in which tracts were allotted to individual tribal members, and many ended up sold off to non-Indians.</p>
        <p>In the cafe I bought a glass of huckleberry juice, then drove an hour back up to the mountains for a last look. A large grouse observed me with nonchalance on the quiet Scenic Byway. A detour due to repaving was a blessing: along a dirt road, a camas meadow was in late bloom, like a hyacinth-blue lake.</p>
        <p>Where to stop along two Scenic Byways</p>
        <p>Getting There</p>
        <p>From Portland, take I-84 approximately 150 miles to Heppner Junction, where the 145-mile Blue Mountains Scenic Byway begins on State Highway 74. After 45 miles, at Heppner, the exceedingly well-marked Byway continues along Willow Creek Road and Forest Service Road 53 to Ukiah and the North Fork John Day campground. From there take the 106-mile Elkhorn Scenic Byway (Forest Service Road 73) east to Anthony Lake and Haines, or, on 73 and Route 7, south to Baker City.</p>
        <p>Or, from Boise, take I-84 to Baker City, and follow the route in reverse.</p>
        <p>Some of the high country roads are blocked until mid-June. Summer and early fall offer fine weather, though nights can be cool, even cold.</p>
        <p>A free guide to the Oregon Scenic Byways is available from the Oregon Tourism Commission in Salem; (800) 547-7842; www.traveloregon  .com. One helpful Web site showing the routes is www.tripcheck.com/ general/scenicbyways.htm.</p>
        <p>Accommodations</p>
        <p>The Grant House Bed-and-Breakfast, where I stayed in Baker City, is currently closed. My room was $55.</p>
        <p>The Geiser Grand Hotel, 1996 Main Street, Baker City, Ore. 97814, (888) 434-7374 or (541) 523-1889, has 30 rooms, a restaurant and saloon. Doubles are $89 to $199.</p>
        <p>At the Economy Inn (now under new ownership, previously the Vagabond Inn), 201 Southwest Court Avenue, Pendleton, Ore. 97801, (541) 276-5252, singles are $37, doubles $50.</p>
        <p>Campsites are available in the mountains, some free and some at $5 to $8. Contact the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest, at (541) 426-5546, or the Umatilla National Forest, at (541) 278-3716.</p>
        <p>Where to Eat</p>
        <p>Geiser's Grand Hotel and Restaurant in Baker City is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner, serving hearty regional meals. Dinners run $15 to $25 without wine.</p>

        <p>What to Do</p>
        <p>Outdoor activities in pristine, uncrowded surroundings are the prime attraction in the Blue Mountains.  Hiking trails abound; maps and information are available from the Wallowa-Whitman and Umatilla National Forests. Outfitters offer pack trips, rafting, fishing.</p>
        <p>For skiing, call the Anthony Lakes Mountain Resort, (541) 856-3277.
