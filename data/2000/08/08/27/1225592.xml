        <p>BARUCH KLAR is like any impresario. This year's Jewish Renaissance Fair, set for next Sunday in West Orange, will be the best ever, he kvells. Among his headliners are Uncle Moishy and the Mitzvah Men. ''There's no Jewish kid that won't like Uncle Moishy,'' he promises. There will also be jugglers, magicians and a storybook hayride.</p>
        <p>''Anybody can have a hayride,'' Rabbi Klar said. ''But we don't stop there.''</p>
        <p>Rabbi Klar's hayride is pulled by two real horses -- not a tractor -- and features a storyteller who regales the children with tales about prophets or Bible figures. Then, in a Chasidic version of a Halloween hayride thriller, the Bible characters jump out from  nowhere to surprise the kids.</p>
        <p>This will be the 22nd fair that Rabbi Klar has put on, but the only one to take place just weeks after the announcement of the first Jewish vice presidential candidate in United States history. Senator Lieberman's nomination has Members of the Tribe abuzz, in New Jersey as everywhere. It's exciting, groundbreaking. But is it good for the Jews?</p>
        <p>''He's not happy being a Senator?'' one Jewish businessman in Teaneck said to William Helmreich, a professor of sociology and Jewish studies at City University of New York.</p>
        <p>The problem, as Professor Helmreich explained, is that Jews are ''not a monolithic  people,'' and many wonder whether Senator Lieberman is ''their kind of Jew.'' In New Jersey, where there are so many different kinds of Jews, from the black-hatted Orthodox isolationists in Passaic to Ralph Lauren-clad Reform Jews in Warren, the Lieberman nomination is a touchstone for each set of tastes and sensitivities.</p>
        <p>For many, perhaps most, their kind of Jew is a Jew just like them: someone who  looks, talks and eats like everyone else, sends their kids to public schools, attends soccer games on Saturdays and goes to synagogue occasionally. Joe Lieberman may not wear a yarmulke in public, but he keeps  kosher and observes Shabbat, and has the kind of relationship with God that puts off  some Jews.</p>
        <p>''He's wearing his religion on his sleeve in a way that makes them cringe,'' Professor Helmreich said.</p>
        <p>But Michael Kogan, chairman of the department of philosophy and religion at Montclair State University, believes that ''Lieberman is a very reassuring figure'' for most Jews: ''He talks like everyone else. He looks like everyone else.''</p>
        <p>Baruch Klar doesn't look like everyone else, and that's a problem for some people.  He has a long, thick beard and on Friday nights wears the traditional black hat and long black coat of Chasidic Jews. Rabbi Klar is a member of the Lubavitchers, a growing group dedicated to bringing nonobservant Jews back into the fold. Unlike some black-hatted Jews who avoid the outside world, Lubavitchers are open, inviting less-religious Jews to their homes for Shabbat dinners and  packaging Judaism in fun and engaging ways. In addition to the fair, for example, the Lubavitchers of Essex County also provide beginners' lessons in Kabbalah, a Jewish form of mysticism, at Borders Books.</p>
        <p>''My life is devoted to bringing Jews together,'' Rabbi Klar said.</p>
        <p>Easier said than done. The shanty Irish and the lace-curtain Irish may boisterously  celebrate St. Patrick's Day together, but Jews are often divided by their differences. Bruce Shoulson, a lawyer with Lowenstein, Sandler in Roseland, who often handles zoning cases for Orthodox groups in New Jersey, says that sometimes the biggest objectors to Orthodox building a yeshiva or ritual bath or the like are other Jews.</p>
        <p>Reform Jews, for their part, feel embattled by Orthodox leaders, who say that they  are Jewish only if born to a Jewish mother or converted by an Orthodox rabbi..</p>
        <p>And then there is the matter of the black hats. Although Professor Kogan says he feels no more threatened by Jews who wear old-fashioned costumes ''than most of my  Methodist friends are by the Amish,'' he is probably in the minority.</p>
        <p>Rabbi Azriel Fellner of Livingston, who lectures widely on Jews in film and television, thinks that the image of co-religionists in 18th-century Polish garb is unsettling. ''To many of us, the black hat is a throwback, a retrogression,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Whatever their differences, Rabbi Klar expects thousands of Jews to attend his fair, as they have before. Some will dress all in  black, some in Ralph Lauren and many, undoubtedly, will be wearing buttons that say, ''Go, Joe, Go.''</p>
