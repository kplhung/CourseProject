        <p>Its appeal is a toss-up between watching 1,200 horses (and their riders, who include members of the United States Equestrian Team) compete for $500,000 in prize money, or watching the East End celebrities the show attracts.</p>

        <p>Best Bet</p>
        <p>Its roots date to the early 1900's, but today the Hampton Classic Horse Show marks its 25th anniversary in its current incarnation with the opening of a week's run in Bridgehampton.</p>
        <p>Its appeal is a toss-up between watching 1,200 horses (and their riders, who include members of the United States Equestrian Team) compete for $500,000 in prize money, or watching the East End celebrities the show attracts.</p>
        <p>With action on five rings and, yes, an Instinet Cyber Cafe where visitors can check their e-mail, the show's highlights include today's ''World of the Horse'' at 1 p.m., after classes for youngsters under 8; free visits to the boutiques and exhibition tents tomorrow, when there is no competition; Seniors Day on Thursday, when those over 60 will be admitted free; the $25,000 Prudential World Cup and Grand Prix Qualifying Class on Friday; Kids Day on Saturday, when the $25,000 Sally Hansen Grand Prix tops the contests; and the four major events next Sunday, topped by the $150,000 Crown Royal Grand Prix.</p>
        <p>The show is held on Snake Hollow Road from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. (631) 537-3177.</p>
        <p>Happy Holiday Weekend</p>

        <p>The pow-wow, on the Shinnecock Reservation, off Route 27A in Southampton, makes its 54th annual appearance Friday through Monday, welcoming 60 tribes from the United States, Mexico and Central America who will dance, sing and share their crafts and foods, with grand entry parades at 6 p.m. Friday, noon and 6 p.m. Saturday and Sunday, and noon Monday (631) 283-6143.</p>
