        <p>THE little house I grew up in in Scarsdale is gone. We knew that its destruction was a possibility when Mom sold it to a contractor two years ago, but we kept up the hope that he would just renovate it or build an addition.

        <p>THE little house I grew up in in Scarsdale is gone. We knew that its destruction was a possibility when Mom sold it to a contractor two years ago, but we kept up the hope that he would just renovate it or build an addition.  It would look vastly different, but it would still be recognizable as the house my Dad built over half a century ago. Unfortunately, it didn't work out that way.</p>
        <p>When I try to be objective, I guess I understand why a builder might have wanted to start from scratch. Our house was beautifully situated just a block from Heathcote Elementary School and had a nice yard, but there's just no getting around the fact that it was a very little house. A split level, it had two small bedrooms, the smaller of which I shared with my sister, Barb, and our overweight beagle, Dottie.</p>
        <p>Aside from a few brief tense, bickering periods during which we would hang a sheet as a room divider in the vain hope of getting a little privacy, we got along quite well as roommates. It was cramped, though -- the room overflowed with school paraphernalia, stuffed animals, my owl collection, Barb's preteenage fan scrapbooks of Paul Revere and the Raiders and other such luminaries, and it was a serious challenge to find space to sit down.</p>
        <p>We had a lot of good times in that little house, though. Many people save their living rooms for company, but space being at a premium, we really lived in ours. Undaunted by the fact that fate had given him two uncoordinated daughters, Dad tried to teach us buttonhook and stop-and-go running patterns in balloon or sofa pillow football. He was an excellent jazz pianist, and we spent countless hours singing, playing duet versions of ''Moonglow'' and listening to his scratched up but wonderful old records.</p>
        <p>He was an awesome storyteller, too, and there was nothing better than flopping down on the sofa and hearing his sweet, hilarious versions of A. A. Milne's Pooh stories or, later on, his wacky mock attempts to help me with my Virgil translations.</p>
        <p>There were plenty of other happy times too: watching College Bowl on cold January Sunday afternoons with a fire crackling in the fireplace, celebrating birthdays with the awful homemade cakes Barb and I concocted or just watching the antics of the various goofy dogs we had over the years.</p>
        <p>After Dad died of lymphoma in 1995, Mom gradually came to the conclusion that the burdens of maintaining a house on her own outweighed the benefits, and she found a nice co-op apartment in nearby Hartsdale.</p>
        <p>The house at 93 Carthage had generally been occupied since she moved out, and its yard and beautiful azaleas had been nicely maintained. But a few weeks ago, Mom got a call from a former neighbor saying that a derrick was parked in front of the house and that demolition was imminent. One Sunday, after our usual lunch at the Heathcote Deli, we plucked up our courage and decided to drive by. As we rode slowly up the street, we saw no sign of the derrick in front of the house, and then we saw why: it was sitting right where our house had been. Our former home, azaleas and all, had vanished.</p>
        <p>When I got home and told my 17-year-old daughter, Kat, what we'd seen -- or rather, not seen -- she went into her room and reappeared with a small piece of broken slate she had dug up from my parents' walk when she was a little girl as a blackboard for her stuffed animals. I know I'm going to treasure that little bit of slate: apart from some photos and our memories, it's all that's left of the house Dad built at 93 Carthage.</p>
