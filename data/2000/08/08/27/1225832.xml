        <p>Several days after the All-Star Game break, members of the Yankees' brain trust, led by George Steinbrenner, sat around the table in the owner's suite at Yankee Stadium and talked about possible players to pursue to bolster the team's sagging offense.

        <p>Steinbrenner and his guest, Tom Reich, have been the targets of news media critics who have questioned deals they have done over the years for some of Reich's free-agent clients.

        <p>Several days after the All-Star Game break, members of the Yankees' brain trust, led by George Steinbrenner, sat around the table in the owner's suite at Yankee Stadium and talked about possible players to pursue to bolster the team's sagging offense. They had a list of 14 players, and a visitor strongly recommended they seek one who was not high on the list.</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner and his guest, Tom Reich, have been the targets of news media critics who have questioned deals they have done over the years for some of Reich's free-agent clients. But no one will second-guess the agent's recommendation in this instance because in his first 67 times at bat in the Yankees' lineup, Glenallen Hill, a Reich client, slugged 12 home runs.</p>
        <p>Hill, whose right-handed power was desired to counter the team's vulnerability to left-handed pitching, has clearly been the star among the three dozen or so players who have been acquired by contenders to aid them in their pursuit of division championships and playoff spots.</p>
        <p>The Yankees, in fact, have clearly outclassed the field with their in-season acquisitions, each one of whom has made contributions to their division-leading status. Of the six position players the Yankees picked up, five were hitting better than .300 entering the weekend: Hill, .429; David Justice, .331; Luis Polonia, .344; Jose Canseco, .333; and Luis Sojo, .310.</p>
        <p>Hill, on the strength of his home run power, had driven in 23 runs in 21 games, and Justice had hit 13 home runs and knocked in 36 runs in 44 games. The five players had hit 30 home runs, nearly one-fifth of the team's total.</p>
        <p>Only four other in-season acquisitions were hitting .300: David Segui of Cleveland, .369; Jack Clark of St. Louis, .364; Lenny Harris of the Mets, .317; and Charles Johnson of the Chicago White Sox, .306.</p>
        <p>The five players not obtained by the Yankees who had the most home runs had hit a total of 20, fewer than the combined total of Hill and Justice. Clark led with five, four of them in the first four games he played with the Cardinals. Hill and Justice have connected regularly for the Yankees.</p>
        <p>Home runs have been alien to Cleveland's Wil Cordero, who was hitting .256. Rico Brogna won a game for Boston the other night, but the hit he did it with was only his fifth in 24 at-bats for a .208 average. Mike Lansing, the second baseman the Red Sox acquired from Colorado, was hitting .212.</p>
        <p>Ron Gant had four home runs for Anaheim but was hitting .205. Harold Baines was hitting .216 for the White Sox, but he was the only player teams acquired from Baltimore who was not hitting well. Besides Johnson, Mike Bordick was at .295 for the Mets and B. J. Surhoff at .292 for Atlanta.</p>
        <p>On the pitching side of the pennant-race pickups, the Yankees and the Braves looked at first as if they had made brilliant moves, the Yankees in adding Denny Neagle and the Braves by gaining Andy Ashby for their rotation. But the brilliance has dimmed in recent starts.</p>
        <p>Ashby won his first three starts, allowing 2 runs in 23 innings. But he has lost four of his last five starts, giving up 24 earned runs in 29 innings as his record has fallen to 4-4 and his earned run average to 4.53. The difference in the two periods has been home runs. No one hit a home run against Ashby in his first three games, but he was rocked for eight in the next five starts.</p>
        <p>Neagle produced nifty performances in his first two starts for the Yankees; both were complete games, and he gave up a total of one run. Since then, however, he has compiled a 1-4 record in 6 starts and allowed 21 earned runs in 21 1/3 innings in the four losses. His overall Yankees record is 3-4 with a 4.67 E.R.A.</p>
        <p>The ramifications of Neagle's ineffectiveness could be a change in the Yankees' postseason plans. If Neagle continues to struggle and David Cone continues his newfound effectiveness, Neagle could be the odd man out of the postseason rotation.</p>
        <p>Curt Schilling will be very much a part of Arizona's October plans, if there is an October for Arizona. In six starts for the Diamondbacks, Schilling has a 4-2 record and a 2.57 E.R.A., making him the most successful in-season pitching addition.</p>
        <p>The Toronto Blue Jays and the Indians each added two starting pitchers. All four have earned run averages that begin with a 5: Steve Trachsel (0-1, 5.56) and Estaban Loaiza (2-3, 5.10) for the Blue Jays and Steve Woodard (0-2, 5.85) and Jason Bere (3-2, 5.59) for the Indians.</p>
        <p>After trading Ismael Valdes to the Chicago Cubs last winter, the Los Angeles Dodgers brought him back for the stretch run, but he has an 0-2 record and 6.65 E.R.A. in five starts and one relief appearance. The White Sox, short on starters, signed Ken Hill after Anaheim released him, and he didn't last three innings in his first start on Thursday.</p>
        <p>Teams have until midnight Thursday to make trades and have their new players be eligible for the postseason.</p>
        <p>Piniella on Payroll and Parity</p>
        <p>Lou Piniella, in his 14th season as a major league manager and his 32nd year as a major league employee, acknowledged this month that ''payroll disparity is a problem.''</p>
        <p>At the same time, however, he added: ''There seems to be more parity than before. There's a lot of parity in baseball; there really is. Teams can all beat you. I don't think there's a place you can go and find you can take a breather.''</p>
        <p>Several days after Piniella offered that seemingly contradictory observation, his Seattle Mariners took a seven-game lead in the American League West, their biggest advantage this season. Five days later, the Mariners' lead had plunged to three games.</p>
        <p>Two losses to Cleveland, a team trying to climb back to the top of the A.L. Central, and three to Detroit, a team climbing out of a gaping early-season hole, brought the Mariners back to the reality of a division race. Three more losses to the Indians, and the Mariners suddenly had an eight-game losing streak.</p>
        <p>They ended it with a victory over the Tigers last Tuesday, but the Tigers came right back and won the other two games of the series, leaving the Mariners only two and a half games ahead of Oakland. The Tigers, meanwhile, reached .500 (63-63) for the first time since the second day of the season. Until the last two months, they had played much of the season 12 to 14 victories under .500. Since June 25, they had a 34-21 record, a .618 winning percentage that would translate to 100 victories for a full season.</p>
        <p>Averting Another Labor War</p>
        <p>Labor peace will reign for another year, but don't get too used to it.</p>
        <p>The players association is expected to notify management in the next day or two that it is exercising its option to extend the collective bargaining agreement for another season, until Oct. 31, 2001. The option has to be acted on by Thursday.</p>
        <p>The optimists say the two sides will peacefully negotiate a new agreement. The realists say: are you kidding?</p>
        <p>In the earlier years of the agreement, representatives of the two sides held informal discussions about a possible extension, but the talks basically ended last spring. Maybe the participants were getting too close and comfortable for the liking of the more militant members of management. They would be the corps of hard-line owners who still dream about a salary cap and will push to revive the idea or a luxury tax on payrolls that would be so steep it would act as a cap.</p>
        <p>A critical outcome of the last negotiation, the luxury tax is not in effect this year and will not be next year. However, the clubs' enhanced revenue-sharing plan will operate at 100 percent for the first time this year and will continue at that rate next year.</p>
        <p>One Man's Art Is Another's . . .</p>
        <p>Stashed away somewhere in the bowels of Shea Stadium is a piece of artwork that the person it celebrates does not appreciate. It's The Moo-kie Baseball Cow, and it has missed out on New York's CowParade because Mookie Wilson couldn't get into the spirit of the city's most unusual summer attraction.</p>
        <p>The painted fiberglass cows have been grazing throughout the city, but the Moo-kie cow didn't make it out of the barn because Wilson objected to it.</p>
        <p>The work of Janet Braun-Reinitz, a Queens artist who had worked previously with Wilson, now a Mets coach, the cow is painted a vibrant blue and orange with baseballs front and rear and a picture of Mookie on the side. The city parks department placed the cow outside the main entrance to Shea Stadium in June, but it did not stay there long.</p>
        <p>Through an oversight by the CowParade people, Wilson was never notified about his namesake's existence. Finding out about the Moo-kie cow when he arrived at the park and saw it, he complained to the Mets and they removed it.</p>
        <p>''I simply told the people I disapprove of it,'' Wilson said. ''It's a matter of common courtesy. Don't just assume. You think I should be flattered. I guess that's what they were thinking. People say I named my dog after you, or my cat. I think: 'O.K., that's your cat. Don't assume I'm going to be flattered that you did it.' ''</p>
        <p>The Moo-kie Cow could have been placed in another pasture, but the Parks Department chose not to display it anywhere out of deference to Wilson.</p>
