        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Cocaine Quietly Reclaims Its Hold as Good Times Return'' (news article, Aug. 21):</p>
        <p>I became more and more incensed when I read about the young professionals who spend their time and money on alcohol and cocaine.</p>
        <p>I see them as callous and indifferent to the suffering and need in the world while they indulge their need for instant gratification. The money they waste on these drugs could be used to benefit those who are in dire need: children without food or medicine or decent schools, people without homes, victims of floods and other disasters.</p>
        <p>I imagine that if a group of young black men were snorting cocaine and drinking beer in a dark alley and were caught by the police, they would likely end up with mandatory sentences in a jail. We should think about this.</p>
