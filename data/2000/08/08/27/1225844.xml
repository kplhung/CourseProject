        <p>United Airlines and its pilots reached a tentative contract yesterday that could bring an end to months of disruption that has forced the airline to cancel more than 20,000 flights and has given it the worst on-time record in the industry.</p>
        <p>Negotiating around the clock since Wednesday at a suburban Chicago motel, the two sides reached agreement on the final issues of job security and compensation late yesterday, one week before their self-imposed deadline of Sept. 1.</p>
        <p>''We are very, very pleased with this tentative agreement,'' said Capt. Rick Dubinsky, the chairman of the United branch of the Air Line Pilots Association, in a message to members. ''By any standard it is truly industry leading.''</p>
        <p>Neither the union nor the airline, which is the world's largest, would divulge details of the tentative contract, which has not been presented to the airline's 10,000 pilots. The union's executive council and the pilots must vote to approve the deal before it is official. But Mr. Dubinsky predicted that the pilots would ''embrace the results enthusiastically.''</p>
        <p>James E. Goodwin, United's chairman, also described the agreement as industry leading in a statement released by the company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goodwin said the company's next priority would be to conclude an agreement with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which represents 55,000 United employees, including mechanics, customer service representatives and ramp workers.</p>
        <p>Their contract came up for renewal last month, leading to further disruption as United reported that the number of its jets taken out of service because of mechanical difficulties suddenly soared.</p>
        <p>United declared an ''operational emergency'' in five cities last week, initiating a contract clause that forces mechanics to work overtime.</p>
        <p>The airline rescinded the order on Friday after the union said it would set back the contract negotiations.</p>
        <p>''I acknowledge that this has been a difficult and frustrating process, particularly for our customers, our front-line employees and our pilots,'' Mr. Goodwin said yesterday.</p>
        <p>He might have added his own name to the list. The labor unrest at United began just as the company announced its intent to buy US Airways, the country's sixth largest carrier, for $4.3 billion. The merger itself was highly controversial but coupled with United's operational woes, opposition in Congress and among consumer groups has grown stronger. Now, many analysts believe the chances of winning government approval of the merger are slim.</p>
        <p>As the world's largest employee-owned company, UAL Corporation, United's parent, was supposed to be immune from the kind of labor unrest it has experienced in recent months. After employees gained control of 55 percent of the company's stock in 1994 during one of the airline industry's most difficult downturns, the company began referring to them as ''owners.''</p>
        <p>But over the past six years, as both the industry and United posted record profits, employees began to resent the wages and work rules they gave up for stock that is locked away in their pension plans. United managers raised expectations by promising to deliver new, lucrative contracts before the previous ones came up for renewal. That is a rare event in the airline industry, where talks often drag on for years.</p>
        <p>The pilot contract came up for renewal in April, and when no deal was reached, pilots began refusing to fly overtime. Under federal law, airline workers cannot strike until given permission by a federal mediator. Short of a strike, the pilots' only available tactic on the job was to decline overtime. The union said it left that decision to individual pilots.</p>
        <p>As a result, United was forced to cancel many flights on their day of departure, inconveniencing thousands of passengers. The cancellations grew worse even as United began paring its schedule. The airline estimates that from April to Aug. 17 it was forced to cancel 23,211 flights.</p>
        <p>Since the pilots and the machinists have contended that they have not  orchestrated any job actions and many of this summer's delays and cancellations have been attributed to weather, it is hard to know how much yesterday's tentative contract will affect passengers.</p>
        <p>Asked if the agreement would improve the airline's performance, Joe Hopkins, a United spokesman, said, ''I think this will help a great deal.''</p>
