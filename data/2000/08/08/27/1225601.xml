        <p>WILLIAM PLUMMER talked about his father one Friday afternoon as he headed out to do a little fishing. ''I don't think I would have gotten into fly-fishing if my life weren't so messed up and he hadn't died,'' he said as his Ford Explorer bounced along the cratered dirt road near the South Branch of the Raritan River.</p>
        <p>Mr. Plummer is, among other things, a father, a writer, a reporter, an ice hockey fan and a Ph.D. in American literature. He has spent his life reporting, analyzing and dissecting other people's lives. He spent a weekend hanging out with Muhammad Ali; a week with John McCain on the campaign trail; a year writing a biography of Neal Cassady, folk hero of the Beats. And, to research a book on boxing hopefuls, Mr. Plummer -- a self-described ''white guy from the suburbs'' -- trained six months at a gym in Spanish Harlem. He has always lived, he said, trying to follow advice once given to Ralph Waldo Emerson: ''Always do what you're afraid to do.''</p>
        <p>When the time came to turn the pen on himself, the South Branch of the Raritan became his most harrowing place -- and his salvation. As he drove to it that recent Friday, though, the river was in no condition to receive visitors. Its water churned like a cauldron of mud soup. ''See how high it is?'' Mr. Plummer said. ''Normally, when it's clear, I like to be able to see the rock formations on the bottom.''</p>
        <p>No matter. He had driven nearly an hour from his home in Montclair to fish, and fish he would. He parked his truck and put on boots and a vest. The water was warm enough to skip waders.</p>
        <p>At 55, Mr. Plummer is powerfully built with a shock of grayish hair and a manner of speaking that reminds one of George Plimpton. In a matter of minutes, Mr. Plummer was wading wet into the river he has taught himself to know so well.</p>
        <p>Mr. Plummer and the South Branch, both Jersey natives, are not easy companions. He fished here as a boy with his father, but the lessons never took. For one thing, father and son did not see eye to eye. The elder Plummer abhorred his son's views on Vietnam, his take on Richard Nixon, his long hair. The two Plummers went their separate ways, loving but loving apart. Then one day 11 years ago, William Plummer Sr., 65, went fishing and died beside this river. His son has spent a decade coming to terms with that loss.</p>
        <p>''I think how it took me years to recognize my father's depths,'' Mr. Plummer writes in a new memoir, ''Wishing My Father Well: A Memoir of Fathers, Sons and Fly-fishing'' (Overlook Press, $24), ''how I am sounding them still. I think how all I ever saw, growing up, was his difference from me. . . . I think how for years, decades really, my father, a nymph fisherman who communicated better with trout than with human beings, must have stood on the periphery of my life, not knowing how to get in.''</p>
        <p>It took Mr. Plummer, an editor at People magazine, five years to write 160 pages of prose that read as clearly as a stream on a good day, with the look, feel and sounds of an angling classic. Still, one does not have to be a father, son, or fly fisher to appreciate the bittersweet lesson of coming to understand someone too late. Mr. Plummer uses fishing as metaphor to address matters closer to the heart, much the way Norman Maclean or John Gierach do. It is a story that urges us to seek the courage to be ourselves, and to take the necessary steps, however fumbling, toward the ones we love.</p>
        <p>Richard Ford called Mr. Plummer's book a tale of ''doing things right. Yet it is also, in its brief course, a book about living life wrong, and in this way is a bracing moral testimony.''</p>
        <p>During the book's long crawl to the page, no fewer than 12 publishers rejected it. One editor -- who saw fit to publish Howard Stern -- wrote, ''Bill Plummer is not a very likable person.''</p>
        <p>It is easy to see where that impression came from. When the book opens, the author's life is a shambles. He has slaved six years on the boxing book, which has hit the mats and disappeared. His marriage is crumbling; his son and daughter are caught in the crossfire. His father's death pushes him into a rageful place, where he mouths off to bosses, instigates shouting matches with referees at his son's hockey games, fears estrangement from his son and sinks into depression.</p>
        <p>But somehow in the span of 10 short chapters, he finds a way to save himself, forging a new life with a new wife, reaching out to his children and achieving something close to his father's hard-won grace.</p>
        <p>The elder Plummer is a main character in the book, pivotal though dead and gone. He grew up in Cranford before World War II, and failed at upwardly mobile office work before committing his heart and hands to the humble work of an antique furniture restorer and fisherman. After his death, his son reads his fishing diaries and starts teaching himself the sport.</p>
        <p>A typical reporter and an even more typical literary scholar, Mr. Plummer comes to the diaries expecting instant emotional disclosure. What he finds is painfully dull stream chatter: a daily litany of flies tied and strategies employed. Only when he quiets himself and achieves the discipline needed to be an expert angler do the words and their lessons finally speak to what he calls ''that stunted organ, my heart.''</p>
        <p>''What I realized afterward,'' said Mr. Plummer, ''was that I could see his mind at work. I could see his humor and irony. And since we never had that intimacy, this was a revelation.''</p>
        <p>AND a healing one, too. ''I think Bill has come full circle,'' said his second wife, Mary Suzanne Huzinec. ''How often can you connect with a father on a soul level after he's deceased?''</p>
        <p>Five months ago, the couple recently had their first child, Alexandra, who accompanies her parents on fishing trips. Mr. Plummer also remains close to his older children, Samantha, 14, and Nick, 21 -- not to mention his mother, Gertrude Plummer, who sells copies of the book in her home furnishing shop in Summit.</p>
        <p>''I think it's a very tender and heartfelt book,'' she said. ''Of course, I'd watched this conflict over the years, and I was happy that it was resolved -- gently resolved. I'm sorry my husband wasn't alive for it.''</p>
        <p>By all accounts, Mr. Plummer has become his father's son, a man attuned to nature in a way the elder Bill would have approved of had he been able to bring himself to say so. But Mr. Plummer is still his own man. The day he worked the murky water, when a kingfisher darted past, he described the species as sporting a ''Samuel Beckett head on a tiny body.''</p>
        <p>Earlier, he tried to put his finger on the secret of his father's bliss. If anything, he said, ''He never cared about making it the way most of us do. He showed me that you have to stop seeing your life in terms of outcomes. For example, you can't go fishing with the idea that you're a failure if you don't catch 10 fish today.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Plummer plied the water with a streamer lure. His lips were pursed, as if doing an impression of a fish, and the technique seemed to work: he caught two, a brookie and a rainbow, with his eight-and-half-foot, five-weight Winston rod. He fished past dusk, when light dies and bats flit over the water. Then he headed back to his truck. He wrung out his socks, stowed his gear, and was off.</p>
        <p>By now, darkness had crept in. His headlights illuminated puddles in the road, making them gleam like black glass. Mr. Plummer spoke of his children, stopped to brake for a deer -- ''Hi, baby,'' he whispered -- then resumed, saying he had worked hard to earn their love. He said his son, a philosophy major, seems more interested in Phish than fish. ''He likes me,'' said Mr. Plummer. ''And who knows? Maybe someday my son will wish me well.''</p>
