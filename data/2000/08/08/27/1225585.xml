        <p>THE math is simple and impressive.</p>
        <p>The School of the Holy Child here has 19 interscholastic high school sports teams at the varsity or junior varsity level. It has 200 girls in its high school grades.</p>
        <p>''Yes,'' said Cathi Wasilik, the director of athletics at the all-girl Catholic school, ''most of our girls play two or more varsity sports. We think it's healthy.''</p>

        <p>THE math is simple and impressive.</p>
        <p>The School of the Holy Child here has 19 interscholastic high school sports teams at the varsity or junior varsity level. It has 200 girls in its high school grades.</p>
        <p>''Yes,'' said Cathi Wasilik, the director of athletics at the all-girl Catholic school, ''most of our girls play two or more varsity sports. We think it's healthy.''</p>
        <p>So does a lot of relevant research. The President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports in 1997 issued its report on ''Physical Activity and Sports in the Lives of Girls,'' which established positive links on myriad fronts.</p>
        <p>In their book ''Raising Our Athletic Daughters'' (Main Street Books, Doubleday, 1998), the authors Jean Zimmerman and Gil Reavill, a married couple living in Hastings-on-Hudson, write: ''New evidence is developing which indicates that girls who play sports tend to avoid the physical, psychological and social pitfalls of modern adolescence. For a number of reasons, sports empowers girls.''</p>
        <p>Among the benefits cited in the book are improved health; lower depression, suicide and teenage pregnancy rates and a greater incidence of both graduating high school and continuing on to college.</p>
        <p>Ms. Wasilik, who is preparing for another year of widespread interscholastic sports in the private-school Fairchester League, joined a department with two varsity teams in 1966.</p>
        <p>''I'm such an advocate.'' she said. ''There is a tremendous amount of do-ability with teenagers. They can be taught that with hard physical work, you can succeed.'' Holy Child teams do. ''Last year we had only two teams below .500,'' Ms. Wasilik said. ''The rest were way over, and three were league champions.''</p>
        <p>Twice this past school year, the girl chosen the best athlete in the county in her sport came from the Holy Child graduating class of less than 50. Meaghan Francella was the undefeated Westchester high school golf champion, while Ms. Wasilik's daughter, Megan, was selected as the top softball player.</p>
        <p>Megan Wasilik, who played three varsity sports, graduated in June and is college bound. ''Nowadays, a girl is looking for a good sports program as well as a good education,'' she said. ''At Holy Child, if you're not participating, you're there cheerleading. It brings us together.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Wasilik said: ''We really want all the girls to get involved.  I've seen studies which indicate that young women who have been involved in organized athletics are less likely to suffer spousal abuse; they have a good sense of self.''</p>
        <p>Denise Francella, Meaghan's mother, works at the school and also coaches the lacrosse team. ''You've got to give a lot of credit for the athletic emphasis to Cathi Wasilik,'' she said. ''And it's wonderful.The girls learn commitment -- time commitment and how to manage their time; it's a big, big plus later on. So is having people depend on you.</p>
        <p>''And it's great socialization, especially for new girls coming in.''</p>
        <p>One doesn't have to be a star to play.</p>
        <p>''In field hockey in the fall we encourage everyone to try,'' Mrs. Francella said. ''Volleyball, too. We try not to cut -- in lacrosse, I didn't cut anyone.''</p>
        <p>The benefits are not just athletic. Ms. Wasilik offered an example.</p>
        <p>''One stands out in my mind,'' she said. ''A shy girl we got involved with field hockey, Christen Marrow of Pleasantville. She's married now and living in England, and while the confidence from field hockey never made her a great player, she went on to help design the Mustang for Ford and to invent that chair which can lean forward to help an elderly or injured person get out of it unaided.''</p>
        <p>When too many enthusiastic youngsters turned out for softball this past spring, Ms. Wasilik lobbied for and received permission to add a junior varsity team. Counting the middle school, which starts in the fifth grade, Holy Child fields 29 school teams.</p>
        <p>Ann Sullivan, heading into her second year as the head of school, said: ''In the sixth grade, athletic participation is mandatory.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Sullivan admitted she found the emphasis on sports an eye-opener when she came to the school.</p>
        <p>''I was very struck by the vigor of the athletic program here, and very impressed,'' she said.  ''We have huge support for the teams. It makes for positive self-esteem.</p>
        <p>''Eighty-five percent of our girls play on a varsity. All those endorphins doing their thing.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Wasilik said: ''The school has a motto: actions, not words. That sort of sets the tone.''</p>
        <p>FOR THE RECORD</p>
