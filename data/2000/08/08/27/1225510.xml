        <p>The Frederik Meijer Gardens and Sculpture Park, opened five years ago on the eastern edge of Grand Rapids, Mich., is more than doubling its indoor space with a 65,000-square-foot expansion. With the Sept. 15 opening of the two-story addition, the 118-acre botanical garden and sculpture park will be complemented by three indoor sculpture galleries, an 850-seat lecture hall with modern audio-visual equipment, classrooms, a garden shop and a cafe.</p>
        <p>The new sculpture complex will open with ''Richard Hunt: American Visionary,'' exhibiting work by the Chicago artist who is creating a 25-foot-tall winged column for the Meijer's permanent collection. That collection includes Nina Akamu's 24-foot-high ''Leonardo da Vinci's Horse,'' the duplicate of her sculpture based on Leonardo's plans that was donated to Milan last year, and works by prominent artists such as Alexander Calder (''Polychrome Lures''), Deborah Butterfield and Marshall Fredericks.</p>
