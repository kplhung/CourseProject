        <p>MAINE is a place of lakes and bays, hills and islands, weathered people who live in plain and weathered buildings; a place eroded to the bone, both hard and tender. Since the 19th century, when Hawthorne and Thoreau published accounts of sojourns there and Thomas Cole and Frederic Church sent paintings of its coast and mountains south to the cities, Maine has represented an accessible wilderness: America's idea of itself.</p>
        <p>Photographers played an important part in inventing this idea of Maine, though their role is less well-known than that of writers and painters. With an ambitious, two-part survey, ''Photographing Maine: 1840-2000,'' the Maine Coast Artists/Center for Maine Contemporary Art documents the themes and variations of photographers' rich and complex reactions to this landscape and its inhabitants. Bruce Brown, the gallery's curator, organized the exhibitions with John Chandler, a former curator. The first installment, covering the years 1950-2000, runs until Oct. 1, and the second, called ''1840's-1940's: The First Century,'' from Oct. 21 to Dec. 2.</p>

        <p>MAINE is a place of lakes and bays, hills and islands, weathered people who live in plain and weathered buildings; a place eroded to the bone, both hard and tender. Since the 19th century, when Hawthorne and Thoreau published accounts of sojourns there and Thomas Cole and Frederic Church sent paintings of its coast and mountains south to the cities, Maine has represented an accessible wilderness: America's idea of itself.</p>
        <p>Photographers played an important part in inventing this idea of Maine, though their role is less well-known than that of writers and painters. With an ambitious, two-part survey, ''Photographing Maine: 1840-2000,'' the Maine Coast Artists/Center for Maine Contemporary Art documents the themes and variations of photographers' rich and complex reactions to this landscape and its inhabitants. Bruce Brown, the gallery's curator, organized the exhibitions with John Chandler, a former curator. The first installment, covering the years 1950-2000, runs until Oct. 1, and the second, called ''1840's-1940's: The First Century,'' from Oct. 21 to Dec. 2.</p>
        <p>Together, they form a short course in American photography. Almost everybody visited Maine, and many stayed. Ansel Adams, Walker Evans, Gertrude Kasebier, Paul Strand -- all have work in Part 2 of the show, while Berenice Abbott, Eliot Porter, Ernst Haas, Arnold Newman, Rudy Burckhardt and William Wegman are among those represented in the current installment. One of its surprises is the number of photographers who came from Maine: Kosti Ruohomaa, for instance, one of Life magazine's great regulars in the 1950's, was born in Rockland. His ''Monhegan Light, January 1957,'' with the lighthouse beacon shining like the low sun, catches the bleakness and exhilaration of a Maine winter, its daily chiaroscuro.</p>
        <p>Scott Peterman, a young photographer whose photographs of ice fishing huts were recently shown in New York, grew up in Camden; in ''Long Lake,'' the painted, recycled boards of a shack acquire the minimal elegance of a Mondrian.</p>
        <p>For year-round Mainers, winter dominates, but to most visitors Maine represents summer. Abelardo Morrell, who began studying photography at Bowdoin College, pinpoints the season's elusive magic in his ''Camera Obscura Image of a Pine Tree in Bedroom, Little Deer Isle.'' The picture superimposes a ghostly state symbol on the interior of a motel room like those where so many passing tourists sleep.</p>
        <p>Despite motel corridors and the poverty of many of its citizens, Maine appears desirable and beautiful, always pristine. Many of the images, like Mr. Morrell's pine, locate their poetry in this contradiction. Haas's ''Maine, 1960'' draws lyrical patterns with a road's white dividing line, the flaking white spokes of an abandoned wagon wheel, the  fading white geometry of a decrepit farmhouse and the bent dark figure of the old farmer. In Patrisha McLean's ''Brandy in a Bathing Suit,'' a little girl grins and arches her back as she leans against a windowsill; she looks like a saucy ripening bean. Observing her balefully through the glass from his chair just inside is an obese and coarsened man, obviously the child's father, and her future.</p>
        <p>In Burckhardt's ''Bunchberries, Deer Isle, 1955,'' delicate leaves float like paper boats on light rippling the forest floor.  Bunchberries and their clumps of red fruit, like Haas's native farmer, have almost vanished in the last half century. But Judy Ellis Glickman's ''Reflections, Great Diamond Island,'' made in 1999, shimmers with a sense of solitude no different from the feeling of George Daniell's ''Portrait of John Marin,'' taken in 1952.</p>
        <p>With 135 pieces, each by a different photographer, ''Photographing Maine'' emerges as a brilliant play on the changing nature of place, on what vanishes and what remains. We come here to this ideal place that promises innocence, hoping that what we see will illuminate that quality in us.</p>
        <p>In Paul D'Amato's ''Girl in Pew, Peak's Island, 1997,'' a girl turns her head, caught in the camera's flash like a deer in headlights. She seems innocent, shot in the plain church where she thought herself safe.  ''Photographing Maine'' snares these living moments: subjects vanish, wilderness diminishes, but the images endure, imprinted in the imagination.</p>
