        <p>THE scene takes place on the Upper West Side of Manhattan between two brothers in search of their identities, caring for each other every awkward, uncertain step of the way.</p>
        <p>Sitting at a hotel cafe, the free-spirited younger brother puts his guitar aside and burns a stare into his older brother's eyes.</p>
        <p>Older Brother: ''What's up? Let it out.''</p>
        <p>Younger Brother: ''Ah, nothing, forget it.''</p>
        <p>Older Brother: ''C'mon, what's on your mind?''</p>
        <p>Younger Brother: ''Well, I didn't know about this ring thing. What's that about?''</p>
        <p>Older Brother: ''I told you, I'm working on getting engaged.''</p>
        <p>Younger Brother: ''But I'm like the last person to know about that. It's a little upsetting.''</p>
        <p>After a brief, smiling stare-off, the brothers laugh out loud.</p>
        <p>Younger Brother: ''She's a great girl. She'll make you happy.''</p>
        <p>The significance of the scene is that it is not a part of ''Smiling Fish and Goat on Fire,'' a 92-minute tale of orphaned brothers and their quirky love affairs in Los Angeles, but from the real lives of the two brothers from Syosset that the independent, award-winning film is based on.</p>
        <p>It is that kind of off-camera affection that makes the romantic comedy, directed by Kevin Jordan and written and produced by Derick and Steven Martini, so real and entertaining.</p>
        <p>''Smiling Fish and Goat on Fire,'' woven together over 12 days on a cash budget of $40,000, opened on Friday at the Angelika Film Center in Manhattan. It makes its Long Island debut on Friday at the Cinema Arts Center in Huntington.</p>
        <p>''Since this was our first time out in terms of writing something, we wanted to tell a simple, good story that people could relate to,'' said Steven Martini, who plays Tony Remi, a struggling actor, the happy-go-lucky younger brother who can't help falling in love.</p>
        <p>''It's pretty much based on our real-life experiences, getting in and out of different relationships,'' said Derick Martini, who plays older brother Chris, a no-nonsense accountant too loyal for his own good, who wakes up one day to hear a wise, friend observe that ''life just gave you a boot in the behind, didn't it?''</p>
        <p>This line is delivered by Bill Henderson, who plays an 80-year-old veteran of the black movie industry literally dying of a broken heart.</p>
        <p>For it is the wit and wisdom of Clive Winters (played by Mr. Henderson) that helps guide Chris through a personal crisis, providing a catalyst for a much-needed change.</p>
        <p>''Bill Henderson is the heart and soul of the movie,'' said Derick Martini. ''I attribute a great deal of the movie's success to him.''</p>
        <p>The unusual title, the audience soon learns, comes from the nicknames the fictional brothers were given at birth by their half-Italian, half-American Indian grandmother. Tony, a bubbly, cheerful infant, was called Smiling Fish, and Chris, who was ''born with a migraine headache,'' was named Goat on Fire.</p>
        <p>''Sure, it's an unusual title,'' said Steven Martini, ''but how many people knew who Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid were when that movie was released?''</p>
        <p>After winning the Festival Discovery Award at the 1999 Toronto International Film Festival, ''Smiling Fish and Goat on Fire'' was picked up by Stratosphere Entertainment for a six-figure sum. Stratosphere also signed the trio to make two more films for the company. Voted best film at the Milan Festival last month, the uncomplicated but engrossing yarn fits into the category of ''date movie.''</p>
        <p>''We're not sitting there in this movie talking about pop culture or Madonna, or trying to show how smart we are,'' said Steven Martini. ''And we're not trying to recreate 'Mean Streets' or 'Pulp Fiction,' like so many independent films in the 90's tried to do.''</p>
        <p>Derick, 26, and Steven, 24, who grew up in Syosset wanting to be actors -- ''We were big 'Star Wars' and 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' fans growing up,'' said Derick Martini -- were split up as children when their parents divorced.</p>
        <p>Derick stayed with his mother, attending Syosset High School, while Steven moved with his father to Manhattan, where he and Mr. Jordan met while attending the Professional Children's School.</p>
        <p>''When I was younger, I went through my Al Pacino, Robert De Niro and Marlon Brando obsessions,'' Steven Martini said. ''But as I got older, I began to idolize the actors a bit less, and appreciate their acting a lot more.''</p>
        <p>After high school, Derick and Steven decided to skip college -- ''Remember that scene in 'The Freshman,' when Marlon Brando visits Matthew Broderick's dorm room, looks around and says: 'This is college? I didn't miss anything,' '' said Derick Martini. ''Well, that's kind of how we feel about it.'' They took small acting parts while Mr. Jordan went on to become an award-winning graduate of New York University's film program.</p>
        <p>One of Mr. Jordan's films caught the attention of the filmmaker Martin Scorsese, who invited Mr. Jordan to Morocco to observe Mr. Scorsese's work on the set of ''Kundun.''</p>
        <p>''The king of independent film,'' as the Martinis refer to Mr. Scorsese, has lent his name to their movie. The opening credits sizzle with the words ''presented by Martin Scorsese'' written boldly across the screen.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, after writing ''Smiling Fish and Goat on Fire,'' the Martinis contacted Mr. Jordan, enlisting him as a director, writer and producer. After going through $40,000 of their own money and credit cards -- their entire savings -- to cover the cost of filming, the Martinis were broke.</p>
        <p>In lieu of paying for additional movie expenses, the threesome bartered for such services by sending live lobsters to company heads from Jordan's Lobster Dock in Brooklyn, owned by Mr. Jordan's father.</p>
        <p>''Even if we didn't have a meeting, we sometimes would just barge in on the head of a company and say, 'Look, we don't have any money, but we have this film, and my family has a lobster business -- can you help us out?' '' said Mr. Jordan. ''The lobsters would be sent as a way to say 'thank you for taking your time to listen.' ''</p>
        <p>According to Derick Martini, the lobster bartering helped raise an extra $50,000 worth of services.</p>
        <p>On the day his movie was nominated in Toronto, Derick Martini did not want to stick around for possible bad news, so he went to the airport for a flight back to Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>''I was at the gate when my phone rang,'' said Derick, his blue eyes turning misty. ''It was Steve, telling me to come back because we had won.</p>
        <p>''We just broke down and started crying,'' he said. ''It was the kind of special moment between two brothers that movies are made of.''</p>
