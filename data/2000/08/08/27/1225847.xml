      <abstract>
        <p>Ellen Karsh letter on August 11 article holds downside to belief that sports fans experience fewer bouts of depression and alienation than nonfans is that fans are viewed by nonfans as dimwits who cannot discuss other topics</p>

        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>As a rabid baseball fan, I was heartened by The Times's report that sports fans experience fewer bouts of depression and alienation than nonfans (''It Isn't Just a Game: Clues to Avid Rooting,'' Aug. 11). But there's a downside to being a sports fanatic that wasn't mentioned.</p>
        <p>Let's say you root for the Mets, as I do. This activity is considered so lowbrow -- O.K., no-brow -- that few people will talk about baseball, even during a lull before a meeting starts when someone can always be counted on to ask, ''So, has anyone seen anything good lately?''</p>

        <p>Let's say you root for the Mets, as I do. This activity is considered so lowbrow -- O.K., no-brow -- that few people will talk about baseball, even during a lull before a meeting starts when someone can always be counted on to ask, ''So, has anyone seen anything good lately?''</p>
        <p>If you don't chime in when conversations turn to movies (or foreign affairs), you are seen as a dimwit. It's fine to talk about ''Gladiator.'' But just mention Mike Piazza and no one makes a peep.</p>
        <p>I spend so much time watching ballgames and trying to figure out who should bat leadoff that I lose track of what's happening in Hollywood and China. So, friends and colleagues probably think I'm not too bright, which is depressing and alienating.</p>
