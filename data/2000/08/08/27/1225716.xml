        <p>AS a fashion model, Anna Karlstrom has seen her share of the good, the bad and the unwearable. So when a garment rates her second look, it means something.

        <p>Ms. Karlstrom, who modeled the Gap clothes on this page, didn't find the pieces assembled for the camera cutting edge exactly.

        <p>AS a fashion model, Anna Karlstrom has seen her share of the good, the bad and the unwearable. So when a garment rates her second look, it means something. Slipping on an orchid-colored leather jean jacket the other day, her eyes grew wide. ''This,'' she murmured, ''is cool, for the Gap.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Karlstrom, who modeled the Gap clothes on this page, didn't find the pieces assembled for the camera cutting edge exactly. But they were, in her view, a hip and wildly colorful departure from the standard issue crew neck T's and khaki trousers that have long been the retailer's mainstay.</p>
        <p>Filtering into Gap stores since mid-July, when the chain sold off the last of its summer cargo shorts, are lace-bordered tank tops, filmy skirts and leathers in hothouse hues of carmine, pink and mauve.</p>
        <p>Clearly, these trend-driven looks were intended by the retailer to shake up shoppers lulled into a torpor by last year's surfeit of khakis, cargo pants and polo shirts.</p>
        <p>''We are showing more fashion,'' acknowledged Kenneth S. Pilot, the president of the Gap brand. ''And we're providing it for a broader audience.''</p>
        <p>The change hasn't come a moment too soon. In the past year, the company has seen its profits slide as consumers defected to competitors like American Eagle and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, which served up Gap-style classics with a brash urban twist. To make matters worse, Old Navy, the Gap's affiliate chain, has been stealing customers from Gap stores, with lower prices for nearly identical merchandise.</p>
        <p>Also contributing to the slowdown at the Gap is a perception by consumers that the store is clotted with casual looks at a time when fashion has moved in a dressier, racier direction.</p>
        <p>Wall Street's declining confidence in the chain's ability to please shoppers has been reflected in its stock price, which has plunged from a February high of $53.75 a share to around $28.</p>
        <p>Recently, however, there have been signs that the retailer is beginning to climb out of its trough by veering from its all-khaki-all-the-time formula, and courting current fashion.</p>
        <p>''They missed the trends in the first half of the year,'' said Rick L. Snyder, a retail stock analyst at Morgan Keegan &amp; Company in Memphis. ''But they got back on track for the second half with fashion-driven merchandise.''</p>
        <p>Richard Jaffe, an analyst with PaineWebber, added, ''Clearly the Gap has changed.''</p>
        <p>By focusing on leather, a hit for the chain last fall, and swinging away from the baggy, androgynous style to a trimmer, snappier silhouette, the store is attempting to ingratiate itself to a fashion-minded, slightly older and more sophisticated audience.</p>
        <p>''There's been a very strong improvement in performance since the Gap sold off its cargo pocket shorts in mid-July,'' Mr. Jaffe said. ''Consumers saw fresh product and spent.''</p>
        <p>The company says shoppers are plucking up crocheted halter tops, swingy leather skirts and shapely jackets, lace-bordered tank tops in sherbet colors -- an array of items that might, in short, have been snatched off the racks at Express, Wet Seal or H&amp;M, some of the Gap's newer competitors.</p>
        <p>''The Gap looks cooler, and that's by design,'' said Lisa Schultz, the retailer's executive vice president for product development and design. Recently, Ms. Schultz, who oversees a 100-member design team, detected a sea change in fashion. The Gap, which looks for direction to MTV, vintage stores and fashion runways, sent small design teams to such fashion destinations as Ibiza, Spain, and South Miami Beach.</p>
        <p>''Even in these casual places, we noticed that fashion had gotten dressier,'' Ms. Schultz said. The Gap  responded with coral-tinted crocheted halters and wispy skirts in scarf-patterned silks and other overtly girlish pieces.</p>
        <p>Ms. Schultz added that the chain's recent tendency to push fashion's envelope is partly a measure of the design department's increasing clout within the company.</p>
        <p>''As in any company, I sometimes have to push for new ideas that might make the merchants here uncomfortable,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But lately, the corporate side has proved more open-minded.</p>
        <p>''These days there's a lot of respect for the design office,'' Ms. Schultz said.</p>
        <p>The company has been cautious, however, about how and where to expand the boundaries of hip. The Gap courts notoriously fickle teenagers, but also older consumers looking for stylish clothes to wear to work, not just on weekends. ''Until now,'' Mr. Pilot joked, ''you couldn't leave home after Sunday.''</p>
        <p>The shift has been noticeable in the men's collection, enlivened and dressed up with stretch button-down shirts and twill trousers, and a vivid infusion of color in everything from Oxford shirts to leather jackets, offered for fall, in a surprising olive green.</p>
        <p>But changes have been most eye-catching in the women's collection. ''For us the style is more about evolution than revolution,'' Mr. Pilot said. But a look at the collection would seem to indicate otherwise.  Among the Gap's decidedly un-Gaplike fall looks: hobo bags in fringed leather or suede, snug-fitting color-blocked sweaters and claret-colored swingy leather skirts -- the kinds of things that blew out of H&amp;M's Fifth Avenue flagship last spring. Large Gap stores in major markets are also stocking ''1969,'' a collection of vintage-style denims bordered in stripes, and tie-dyed designs, the last group inspired by Tokyo street fashions.</p>
        <p>''Our idea,'' Ms. Schultz said, ''is to offer items that you can mix with basic looks found elsewhere in the store, and by that strategy keep customers in the store who might have ventured elsewhere.''</p>
        <p>After Labor Day, the new merchandise mix will be reflected in the retailer's windows and outdoor advertising.</p>
        <p>''It has to, because I can't look at khaki one more day,'' Mr. Pilot said, chuckling.</p>
