        <p>One Day in the Life</p>
        <p>of a Born Again Loser</p>
        <p>And Other Stories.</p>
        <p>By Helen Norris.</p>
        <p>University of Alabama, $24.95.</p>
        <p>Three of the nine stories in Helen Norris's fourth collection take place around Christmas, but don't look for Currier &amp; Ives scenes here. Often quirky and occasionally poignant, these narratives give us a peek into a host of interesting lives. In the title story, Theron Estes, recently released from jail, returns home to find his wife has left him and their two young daughters behind. His effort to provide Christmas dinner for his family by answering a classified ad leads him on a bizarre adventure. Norris, who is the poet laureate of Alabama, can find humor even in subjects like memory loss. In ''Niagara Falls,'' a woman who can't recall where she put the Christmas presents she bought for herself -- If she could only forget them, but her memory was not so bad as that'' -- moves in with some other women who also are tired of having to remember things. ''The Bower-Bird,'' perhaps the collection's finest story, recounts the disturbing experience a man has trying to visit a fellow Vietnam veteran. Norris's stories grow on you, to borrow one of her own phrases, like a wisteria vine.</p>
