        <p>Ander Crenshaw, Republican running in Congressional primary in Florida, pulls commercial showing him with former Pres Reagan at request of Reagan's office, which responds to complaint from supporter of his primary rival, Dan Quiggle (M)</p>

        <p>It seemed like a good political move to Ander Crenshaw, a Republican running for the open seat in Florida's Fourth Congressional District, which covers Jacksonville.</p>
        <p>With the Sept. 5 party primary just a couple of weeks off, Mr. Crenshaw, a former state senator, figured running a television advertisement showing him standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Ronald Reagan might give him an edge over the other primary contender, Dan Quiggle, a businessman. Mr. Crenshaw had served as co-chairman of the Reagan presidential campaigns in Florida in 1980 and 1984, so what better way to play up his Republican bona fides than to be seen with the most popular Republican of them all?</p>

        <p>It seemed like a good political move to Ander Crenshaw, a Republican running for the open seat in Florida's Fourth Congressional District, which covers Jacksonville.</p>
        <p>With the Sept. 5 party primary just a couple of weeks off, Mr. Crenshaw, a former state senator, figured running a television advertisement showing him standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Ronald Reagan might give him an edge over the other primary contender, Dan Quiggle, a businessman. Mr. Crenshaw had served as co-chairman of the Reagan presidential campaigns in Florida in 1980 and 1984, so what better way to play up his Republican bona fides than to be seen with the most popular Republican of them all?</p>
        <p>A Quiggle supporter objected in a letter to the former president's office in Los Angeles. Was the president choosing up sides in a party primary, generally a big political no-no?</p>
        <p>Back came a letter -- to Mr. Crenshaw, signed by Joanne Drake, chief of staff in the office. It read:</p>
        <p>''I must ask you to cease and desist the use of such photo immediately. Photographs that have been taken with President Reagan in his office or at various events throughout the years are strictly meant for personal use and never for solicitation, campaign or marketing purposes.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Crenshaw pulled the advertisement. But his campaign insisted it was never meant to imply an endorsement, only to show that he's been a loyal Republican for years.</p>
        <p>Big deal, said Mr. Quiggle. He too, he noted, was well acquainted -- and well photographed -- with Mr. Reagan, having once been a White House intern. But, he crowed, he ''respected the wishes of the Reagan family'' and chose not to use his pictures in a campaign advertisement.</p>
