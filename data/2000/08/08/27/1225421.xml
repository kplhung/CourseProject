        <p>BLOOD OF THE LIBERALS  By George Packer.</p>
        <p>405 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux. $26.</p>
        <p>Liberals, who haven't had a good day since sometime in late 1965, won't be having another one this morning. Their ''ism'' is now the subject of America's favorite funereal genre, the memoir. What poverty was to Frank McCourt, what alcoholism was to Mary Karr, what death was to Dave Eggers, liberalism is to George Packer. It's the dysfunction that serves as the larger-than-life force that shapes the people in his book as they wretchedly press up against a thing they can never quite comprehend. Liberals can take some comfort: Packer shows how liberalism occasionally succeeds by failing frequently.</p>
        <p>Like those other memoirists, Packer was born into unusual circumstances that permit him to tell a remarkable story. His grandfather was a turn-of-the-century agrarian progressive in Alabama; his father a mid-century intellectual Jew in California; and Packer himself is a political nomad trying to unearth the meaning of a concept that sometimes seems as dated as feudalism.</p>
        <p>Packer nicely threads the day-to-day decisions of his father and grandfather with the larger ideas that possessed them. As the stories of their lives unfold, the often dry history of liberalism (movements, coalitions) gets told at the intimate level of flawed men straining to make an idea of the world mesh with the whimsies of human nature. This book belongs on the shelf next to ''Angela's Ashes,'' ''The Liars' Club,'' and ''A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius.''</p>
        <p>Packer's grandfather, George Huddleston, was elected to Congress from Alabama in 1915 and set out to resolve the paradox that tormented Jefferson. How do you square a right to liberty with a claim to equality? Jefferson (and Huddleston) believed that the agrarian model -- being free both politically (civil rights) and economically (self-sufficiency) -- led to natural virtue and equality. But by the time Huddleston went to Washington, industrialization had already made a travesty of that idea through such excesses as ''convict lease'' -- a deal where states would ''rent'' their prisoners to the new factories. Early in the century, convict lease generated as much as one-third of Alabama's budget. The police arrested almost anyone for anything, concerned less about keeping the peace than supplying the labor.</p>
        <p>Huddleston was cautious in his efforts to use federal power to snatch back some portion of Jefferson's ideal of individual freedom from the teeth of corporate power. These were the days of trust-busting schemes such as Woodrow Wilson's New Freedom and Theodore Roosevelt's New Nationalism. Conservatives, at the time, resolved the dilemma (between ballooning conglomerate power and shrinking civic equality) by simplifying Jefferson's ideas as mere equal opportunity -- an argument that survives on talk radio today. ''Freedom meant the freedom, guaranteed by the Supreme Court, to hire children,'' Packer writes. ''Equality meant that in theory anyone could become Andrew Carnegie.''</p>
        <p>Packer nicely captures his grandfather's nuanced thinking over decades, concluding with his vote against the New Deal as too great a coalescence of federal power. Huddleston's president shunned him for it, and in 1936 he was voted out of office. Packer tells this story not from the halls of Congress but from within Huddleston's dining room, where the author's mother gambols about, enchanted with all these big ideas. What we see is not just some politician getting dumped but the horror of a little girl watching her daddy's fall.</p>
        <p>Herbert Packer, the author's father, was an early meritocrat. Growing up near New Haven, he managed to overcome two negatives -- being local and being Jewish -- to gain admission to Yale. He served in the Navy before becoming a legal scholar and a classic programmatic liberal in the post-New Deal, post-Huddleston mold. ''Procedure,'' he once said without irony, ''is at the heart of all liberty.'' This second section of this book is tinged with a pathos that the author occasionally paints with too heavy a brush, but just as often hits perfectly. When the father is asked to analyze the procedural fairness of anti-Communist Congressional hearings like the ones on Alger Hiss, he gets lost in the Borgesian task of deconstructing 200,000 pages of testimony and suffers from ''suicidal depression'' before delivering up a bloodless tome entitled, ''Ex-Communist Witnesses: Four Studies in Fact Finding.''</p>
        <p>''His passion lay in reason,'' the son writes. ''This was not the building block of a powerful political movement. Millions don't rally to the banner of Uncertainty. Procedural liberalism takes the individual in isolation; there is no class or community whose interests and desires it answers. It stands alone, like a man sifting through 200,000 pages without a hope of finding answers.''</p>
        <p>Herbert Packer concludes his career -- almost poetically -- like his father-in-law. The passage of time has made his once ardent liberalism look like sold-out lumpen conservatism. In Packer's case, he winds up as an administrator at Stanford at the height of the Vietnam War. He wrecks himself struggling to reason with radicals capable of unanswerable sentiments such as ''students are niggers,'' and he suffers a destructive stroke. His lifelong love of reason is now trapped inside a stroke victim's emotional storms.</p>
        <p>Packer fils tells this story -- not from the halls of Stanford but from within his own dining room. We see not only an intellectual being destroyed but also the horror of a little boy watching his daddy's fall. Packer can construct some powerful declarative sentences: ''My father's right arm hung against his body, the useless hand curled rigid. He brought the food to his mouth with his shaky left hand. His thoughts now reached his tongue and stuttered out 30 seconds too late. When his frustration was unendurable, the curses exploded in thick choked stammers. Dinner became the sound of silverware.''</p>
        <p>In the final part of the book, Packer himself -- he is the author of ''The Village of Waiting,'' a memoir about his experience in Africa, and two novels -- graduates from Yale and begins his own liberal odyssey. He joins the Peace Corps just as Ronald Reagan is revamping it. ''English teachers,'' Packer writes, ''were being phased out for small-business advisors.'' In a hut in Africa, he has an existential crisis of sorts and he begins a pilgrimage through liberalism's last precincts. He joins the Democratic Socialists of America (a detour that provides many fine comic riffs), volunteers at a soup kitchen, attends the Promise Keepers' Washington march, works as a carpenter and then, the final humiliation, becomes a magazine writer.</p>
        <p>Liberalism is in exile, Packer proves (rather painfully), yet rather than abandon the hope of reform he soldiers on, quite absurdly for now, preferring the windmill-tilting of his family's creed to the ease of joining in with conservatism's refrain of the Big No. Almost immediately after the American Revolution, Packer writes, property ''ceased to be the safeguard that made you virtuous and became what it is today: the commodity that made you rich.'' Yet despite the fact that ''Jefferson's republic where no one owned anyone else'' collapsed into a perpetual market-oriented bazaar, we can't quite forget those early democratic hopes, our cornball ideals, those beautiful sentences. (''We hold these truths.'') Liberalism revives, Packer concludes, when we remember. Those notions still haunt us today, ''like a memory of youthful idealism that occasionally disturbs the torpid compromises and evasions of our middle-aged afternoons.'' From time to time, Packer writes, ''not more than once a century -- it suddenly reappears, and our slackness produces a wave of self-disgust, and we hurl ourselves into reform.''</p>
