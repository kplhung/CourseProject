        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>I nodded with recognition as I read ''It Isn't Just a Game: Clues to Avid Rooting,'' on the psychological benefits of being a sports fan. But I began to cringe when the article discussed the one female sports fan depicted: a woman who turned to sports as a substitute for a disappointing life.</p>
        <p>I have a different story. Until three years ago, I had little interest in sports. Then, at a Mets game, my date took the trouble to explain the daunting barrage of statistics that are an important part of baseball. I became interested, then intrigued, then hooked. I am now an avid Mets fan.</p>

        <p>And as my interest in sports developed, the rest of my life developed apace. Since I became a Mets fan, my health (helped, in part, by watching Mets games at the gym), happiness and career have all flourished.</p>
