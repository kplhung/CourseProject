        <p>TOWERING 185 feet over Sag Harbor, the steeple that crowned the Old Whalers First Presbyterian Church was visible for miles, the first sight of home for returning sailors in the 19th century, when this village was a booming whaling town.</p>
        <p>Extraordinary in design and construction, the spire, built in 1844 in the Egyptian Revival style by the noted architect Minard Lafever, was shaped like a sailor's spyglass in three sections: an octagonal colonnade at the bottom, a middle section designed to house a clock from the famed local clock-maker Ephraim Byram and a slender top resembling a minaret with an ornate vane.</p>

        <p>TOWERING 185 feet over Sag Harbor, the steeple that crowned the Old Whalers First Presbyterian Church was visible for miles, the first sight of home for returning sailors in the 19th century, when this village was a booming whaling town.</p>
        <p>Extraordinary in design and construction, the spire, built in 1844 in the Egyptian Revival style by the noted architect Minard Lafever, was shaped like a sailor's spyglass in three sections: an octagonal colonnade at the bottom, a middle section designed to house a clock from the famed local clock-maker Ephraim Byram and a slender top resembling a minaret with an ornate vane.</p>
        <p>Then the mighty winds of the 1938 hurricane lifted the steeple and sent it crashing to the ground.</p>
        <p>A history of the church, published in 1994 for its 150th anniversary, recalls several unsuccessful campaigns to restore the steeple over the years, beginning with the one the Rev. Sidney H. Barrett began almost as soon as the winds had subsided. Though the pastor personally raised more than $1,400, contributions from townspeople and parishioners fell short and the plan languished.</p>
        <p>When the idea resurfaced in the 1950's, the price tag was $100,000, which seemed out of reach.</p>
        <p>Then, in the 1970's, a foundation grant that would have covered the bill for a full restoration, then estimated at more than $250,000, fell through. Church members worried about maintenance costs, and by the end of the decade the foundation had suffered economic reversals.</p>
        <p>Now there is hope again. With a plan that marries high tech and historic restoration, a committee formed eight years ago is optimistic about achieving the goal that has eluded others.</p>
        <p>''Everything has coalesced very nicely over the last three or four months,'' said the chairman of the campaign, Randolph Croxton, a Manhattan architect.</p>
        <p>Mr. Croxton, a part-time Sag Harbor resident, has been leading an effort to interest cellular-phone companies in helping the restoration by helping themselves, pitching the idea that a 185-foot steeple is the perfect place to hide a transmission tower.</p>
        <p>At first the goal was to get the cellular companies to build the steeple, a project Mr. Croxton said would cost $2 million with the communications equipment.</p>
        <p>When there were no takers at that price, the strategy shifted. Now the committee is looking for a few ''key donors'' to finance reconstruction of the steeple. At the same time, members are urging the cellular carriers to rent space in the steeple for an antenna, which Mr. Croxton said has yielded encouraging results.</p>
        <p>The target figure for leasing the steeple is ''$100,000 a year in cash income,'' said Mr. Croxton, mostly for maintenance. Of the four major carriers he approached, he said, one had essentially signed on and another had given an informal commitment. ''We need a third one,'' he said, declining to identify any of them until all deals are sealed.</p>
        <p>The invisibility of the antenna, and the promise of rental income that would relieve the 200-member congregation of worries over the cost of maintenance, has apparently reassured any skeptics: the church's governing body recently voted unanimously to support the plan.</p>
        <p>The arrangement seems to have clear advantages for the cellular companies. Communications towers are often considered eyesores; local opposition can be vehement.</p>
        <p>In rural areas, where blending the towers into the landscape is more difficult than in cities, companies have been known to hide their equipment in fake pine trees, unused silos and the sky-high road signs that lure expressway drivers to nearby gasoline stations. In small towns, church steeples are often the highest point for miles and are actually ''among the best places to put a cellular tower,'' according to Travis Larson, a spokesman for the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association. The group said such setups already exist in Pennsylvania and the Washington, D.C., area.</p>
        <p>While putting a tower inside an existing structure can add to the initial cost ($150,000 is a common estimate for the undisguised version), the savings and the good will gained in avoiding a zoning fight can tip the balance. But putting up $2 million to build a steeple from scratch is another matter.</p>
        <p>''You can't cover $2 million,'' said another industry expert, Ben Campanelli, who helps companies find locations for towers in upstate New York. To refit a silo might ''top out at $250,000 or $500,000,'' he said, noting that an existing church steeple with the right dimensions might be economical but that building a new one as complex and costly as the Sag Harbor reproduction would not.</p>
        <p>With that in mind, members of the restoration campaign have begun an ambitious fund-raising effort. As a start, over the Fourth of July weekend, the committee placed full-page ads in the major East End newspapers appealing to contributors to share the cost of restoring ''this unique legacy.''</p>
        <p>''We have about squeezed this congregation as hard as we can,'' said David Cory, a member of the committee and a local historian. Like Mr. Croxton, he emphasized that replacing the steeple will be but the final step in what has been a long process.</p>
        <p>Among other things, property at the front of the church has been relandscaped to restore a forecourt that was part of Lafever's original plan for an ''Egyptian layout.'' A fence that had been missing ''for about 100 years,'' according to Mr. Cory, was rebuilt by a local craftsman who used old photographs as his guide. (The fence posts are in the shape of Egyptian obelisks.)</p>
        <p>Work was also done on the roof and the gutters, and the stairs at the front of the church were rebuilt. And perhaps the single most rigorous and visible effort was undertaken in 1995, when the church was scaffolded and the facade completely restored, down to the last detail of the carved blubber-spade ornamentation along the roofline, a tribute to the whaling men who helped build it.</p>
        <p>This fall, as one of the last items on its pre-steeple agenda, the committee will oversee the restoration of the windows in the main sanctuary.</p>
        <p>All this -- along with rewiring, installation of air-conditioning and fire-detection systems, and structural work to prepare for securing a new steeple -- was accomplished with contributions from parishioners, matching grants from New York State and a few donors from outside the congregation.</p>
        <p>''They have come through marvelously,'' Mr. Cory said of church members. ''Several hundred thousand dollars have been raised.''</p>
        <p>But the $3 million total they expect to spend before the restoration is complete ''goes way beyond bake sales and bus trips,'' Mr. Cory said. It might be time, he suggested, to tap the sizable pool of millionaires in the area who think nothing of ''building $11 million and $12 million houses around here.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cory stressed that it is not just parishioners who recognize the building's importance: The church was ''a primary ingredient'' of Sag Harbor's successful application for designation in the 1970's as a historic district.</p>
        <p>Probably ''more important than anything'' in establishing the church as a unique architectural treasure, Mr. Croxton said, was the research that firmly established that Lafever, a leading architect of his time, was its designer.</p>
        <p>For years the authorities had been equivocal about attributing the church to Lafever, but research has brought to light a letter written by a young cabinetmaker who was working on the church building in 1843 and definitely placed the architect on the site. The letter left no doubt that the design for the church, the most important example of Egyptian Revival in the United States, was Lafever's.</p>
        <p>Now, with its legitimacy affirmed, most of the preliminary work completed and a promising plan for financing maintenance, raising the funds to build the new steeple looms as the final hurdle. Once actual construction begins -- and there is clearly confidence that it will happen -- the hard part will be over, as far as Mr. Croxton is concerned.</p>
        <p>''This type of work is not terribly unusual,'' he said, of the high-altitude construction job. ''What makes it unusual is that it will be done in the context of an historic building.''</p>
        <p>Strictly speaking, steeplejacks, like those who appear in old photographs of the church as small specks clambering up the sides, are no longer involved, Mr. Croxton said. But people who are ''comfortable climbing steel'' will still be necessary, he added, just as they are whenever a new skyscraper goes up in the city.</p>
        <p>The original builders gave Sag Harbor a steeple that stayed put for almost 100 years. Expectations for the new steeple are considerably higher.</p>
        <p>''The idea,'' Mr. Cory said, ''is that if it is built properly, the church can blow away and the steeple would still be here.''</p>
