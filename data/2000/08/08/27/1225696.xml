        <p>The international film festival in Venice, Italy, next week may be rife with vanity cases, but only three of them will actually be for sale. At the festival on Thursday, Sharon Stone will introduce the amfAR Collection, cosmetics carriers that she designed in conjunction with Louis Vuitton, offering one of each of the line's three styles at an auction to benefit the American Foundation for AIDS Research.</p>
        <p>The largest case, a hard-sided makeup carrier called the amfAR One, is inspired by the classic movie-set style. It is made of LV-logo canvas, with red leather lining, and has three hinged sections containing nine small drawers, a glass pull-out tray for mixing makeup colors, a small jewelry case that doubles as an evening bag, and numerous other nooks and crannies. ''It's designed for someone like me,'' Ms. Stone said, ''someone who has to travel a lot and really be together when they travel. Other vanity cases were always too small for the amount of junk I drag around with me -- I wanted to be able to pack all my hair, makeup and bath products in one piece of luggage that I could just open in the bathroom.''</p>

        <p>The amfAR Two is a diminutive version of the One (''a wonderful size for anyone who doesn't really have to make appearances or presentations,'' Ms. Stone said). The amfAR Three is a soft canvas tote bag.</p>
        <p>And while both the Two ($9,300) and the Three ($695) will be sold in Louis Vuitton stores in September, the One is one of a kind, offered only at the Venice auction. Phone bids will be accepted through Aug. 30: 011-39-041-241-0730.</p>
