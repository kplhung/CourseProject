        <p>Representatives of a major Buddhist order have petitioned the Indian government to grant asylum and freedom of movement to their 15-year-old leader, the Karmapa, who remains under virtual house arrest at a monastery in northern India eight months after fleeing Tibet.</p>
        <p>About 400 of his followers from around the world, including a contingent from the order's American headquarters in Woodstock, N.Y., met in India last week to consider their next moves in a campaign to have the immigration status of the Karmapa clarified by India, which he entered illegally in January after a grueling overland Himalayan trek from Tibet through Nepal.</p>
        <p>The Karmapa's followers are also demanding that he be allowed to take charge of his school's primary monastery outside Tibet, at Rumtek, in the Indian state of Sikkim.</p>
        <p>The young religious leader, Ugyen Trinley Dorje, is recognized by Buddhists of the Kagyu school -- one of four main branches of Tibetan Buddhism -- as their leading reincarnated lama, or teacher.</p>
        <p>Large communities of Kagyu Buddhists live in Europe, North America and East Asia. Their headquarters in the United States is the Karma Triyana Dharmachakra Center in upstate New York, a site chosen by the young Karmapa's predecessor. The monastery, known as K.T.D., is the largest Kagyu center outside the Himalayas. Monks and lay residents at the center expect that the Karmapa will come to Woodstock to stay for extended periods, once he is free to travel.</p>
        <p>''Once everything gets settled, he will definitely come to K.T.D.,'' said Thomas C. Schmidt, who directs the monastery's Tibetan religious music programs. ''This is one of his residences, the most important after Tsurphu and Rumtek.''</p>
        <p>The Indian government has not replied to the request for asylum, American Buddhist leaders say. India faces a complicated situation in dealing with the Karmapa. His flight from the Tsurphu monastery, near the Tibetan capital, Lhasa, was an embarrassment to the Chinese government, with which India is attempting to improve relations.</p>
        <p>Moreover, China's perceived enemy, the Dalai Lama, leader of another Buddhist school but recognized universally as Tibetan Buddhism's foremost figure and the leader of a Tibetan government in exile, has joined in demanding the Karmapa's release, saying that it was wrong to prevent him from taking up his religious duties and the higher studies he has said he went to India to pursue.</p>
        <p>At a news conference in Los Angeles in June, the Dalai Lama said that the Karmapa would be an important symbol for new generations of Buddhists. ''Buddhist spirituality needs to be carried on,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Karmapa's followers have gained an unexpected ally in the political leader of Sikkim, a former Buddhist kingdom annexed by India in 1975 after it undermined and deposed Sikkim's last king, Palden Thondup Namgyal, who was married to an American, Hope Cooke.</p>
        <p>In July of this year, a large delegation of senior Buddhist monks from the state met with Chief Minister Pawan Chamling and apparently persuaded him that public opinion was strongly on the side of the young Karmapa, who is being challenged for control of Rumtek by a rival lama.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chamling went to New Delhi recently to argue that the Sikkimese wanted the Karmapa to be seated at Rumtek without delay. He met with Indian officials just before the Karmapa's followers began their meeting at his monastery near the Dalai Lama's base at Dharamsala on Aug. 19, which the Dalai Lama also attended.</p>
