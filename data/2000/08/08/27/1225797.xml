        <p>There's a superman at Virginia Tech, and an old man at Florida State. There's the passing man at Purdue, a running man at Nebraska and dueling men at Texas. They have little in common except that they are quarterbacks and that the prospects of their teams reaching bowl games or earning a national title are in the care of their feet, their arms and, especially, their heads.</p>
        <p>This group may not go down in history as famous as the quarterbacks of 1982: the future Pro Football Hall of Famers John Elway, Dan Marino and Jim Kelly.

        <p>There's a superman at Virginia Tech, and an old man at Florida State. There's the passing man at Purdue, a running man at Nebraska and dueling men at Texas. They have little in common except that they are quarterbacks and that the prospects of their teams reaching bowl games or earning a national title are in the care of their feet, their arms and, especially, their heads.</p>
        <p>This group may not go down in history as famous as the quarterbacks of 1982: the future Pro Football Hall of Famers John Elway, Dan Marino and Jim Kelly. They may not end up as National Football League starters like the quarterbacks of 1998: Tim Couch in Cleveland, Donovan McNabb in Philadelphia, Akili Smith in Cincinnati, Cade McNown in Chicago and Daunte Culpepper in Minnesota.</p>
        <p>They are a diverse, intriguing bunch who have been chosen to play the most important position in football by coaches who argue that quarterbacking on the college level transcends merely possessing football skills. It means showing as much maturity and toughness Sunday through Friday away from the stadium as they do on the field on Saturday.</p>
        <p>''You're talking about 19- or 21-year-old kids who have a full-time job as a student and a full-time job as team leader and focal point in the offense,'' said Greg Davis, the offensive coordinator for Texas, where Major Applewhite and Chris Simms are battling for the starting job. ''You have devoted fans, media, radio shows, the Internet watching their every move. They get too much credit when they do good, too much blame when they do bad.</p>
        <p>''On Saturdays, they face swarming, attacking defenses forcing the quarterback to make the game. The reason is that defensive coordinators have decided there are more tailbacks in the country that can beat you than quarterbacks. It's a tremendous amount of pressure that requires a remarkable kind of person.''</p>
        <p>This season, the two most watched quarterbacks could not be more different. Michael Vick of Virginia Tech represents what coaches believe the position will look like in the future. He runs the 40-yard dash in 4.25 seconds, has a left arm that can flick a pass 65 yards downfield and appears to have a supernatural ability to turn potential trouble into touchdowns. Last season in the national title game against Florida State, Vick demonstrated how dangerous this combination can be when he put up 322 yards of offense and helped erase a 14-point halftime deficit with a 15-point third quarter before the Hokies lost, 46-29.</p>
        <p>Maybe Florida State defensive end David Warren best summed up what teams face when taking on Vick and the Hokies. ''He's better than what we saw on film,'' Warren said. ''And that's saying a lot because we were in awe of him on film. By the third quarter, our defense was exhausted. It was like chasing a chicken or a cat around. Everywhere you look, he's there. And once you get there, he's not.''</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Warren's teammate and the winning quarterback in the Sugar Bowl, Chris Weinke, is what the college quarterback has typically looked like. Almost. He is 6 feet 5 inches, a drop-back passer who threw for 3,103 yards and 25 touchdowns last season, and unflappable enough not to have thrown an interception in his last 237 attempts. He is also 28 years old after showing up in Tallahassee four years ago after a minor league baseball career. He is Coach Bobby Bowden's first three-year starter at quarterback and the leader of the defending national champion.</p>
        <p>''He's like a coach on the field, yet he always knows his role,'' Bowden said. ''That's probably one of the greatest things he's got going for him right now. He knows his place. He's not trying to act like a coach. He keeps himself at the level of our other players, even if he is five or six years older.''</p>
        <p>Vick and Weinke may very well end up in a national championship rematch in the Orange Bowl. For that to happen, each has tried to emulate the other's strength.</p>
        <p>Vick will not sneak up on anyone the way he did last season. As a redshirt freshman, he led the nation in passing efficiency, threw for eight touchdowns, ran for five and finished third in the Heisman Trophy balloting. He is a full-blown star now on a young team that wants to prove that last year was no fluke.</p>
        <p>''I was the marquee player last year, too,'' Vick said, shrugging off the heightened expectations. ''I knew everyone was gunning for me.''</p>
        <p>His coach, Frank Beamer, wants Vick to play smarter -- for example, running out of bounds more often to avoid debilitating hits. ''Where he will improve, after a full year of experience, is in making decisions,'' Beamer said.</p>
        <p>Vick concurred, still wincing at the bruises he nursed in the wake of the Sugar Bowl. ''I just decided I can't take all that punishment,'' he said. ''Maybe I'll only run for touchdowns.''</p>
        <p>Weinke surprised the Seminole coaching staff by paring 20 pounds off his sturdy frame before this summer's practices and by showing more agility out of the pocket, especially on roll-out patterns. No one will mistake him for Vick, but his center, Jarad Moon, says the effort was noticed by his teammates. ''I've never seen a player be a leader for the offense and defense,'' Moon said. ''A lot of times it seems the offense and defense are separate teams. But everybody looks up to Chris.''</p>
        <p>Last Chance at Purdue</p>
        <p>In the Big Ten, they look up to Drew Brees of Purdue, who is very likely to finish the year with virtually every conference passing record.</p>
        <p>Brees has little to prove individually -- over three years he has thrown for 64 touchdowns and more than 8,000 yards while completing 62 percent of his passes. But the Boilermakers have not gone to the Rose Bowl since 1966 and, coming off a disappointing 7-5 season -- including a blown 25-point lead in a loss to Georgia in the Outback Bowl -- there is pressure for Brees to carry the team further.</p>
        <p>Coach Joe Tiller is trying to help by adding more downfield routes to his multiple-receiver spread offense. He wants Brees to go deep more often and manage the clock better.</p>
        <p>''I think it might have handicapped his style of play because he didn't look for the big play as much as he had in the past,'' Tiller said. ''And he's a guy you have to give the game to and let him go with it. We want the ball in Drew's hands with the chips on the line because that's when he's best.''</p>
        <p>Michigan can only hope the ball is in Drew Henson's hands. Wolverine fans have been obsessed with Henson, although he has not started a game. But he has frustrated them again by fracturing his right foot last week and requiring surgery that will delay his season several weeks.</p>
        <p>Michigan Coach Lloyd Carr not-quite-alternated Henson with the departed Tom Brady the past two years, teasing fans with glimpses of Henson, a strong-armed 6-4, 218-pounder who completed 49.6 percent of his passes for 800 yards in 18 games. To hear Carr tell it, between sitting behind Brady and taking criticism from the Wolverine faithful for playing minor league baseball, Henson is mentally prepared to lead a talented team -- if he can come back healthy.</p>
        <p>''Drew Henson has to carry the mantle all of the quarterbacks here at Michigan have to deal with -- they are never good enough and there is always someone behind them that is better,'' Carr said. ''You can go back to Elvis Grbac, Brian Griese, Tom Brady, and it will be the truth in the year 2050. That is part of dealing with things when you are a high-profile athlete.''</p>
        <p>Running It Out at Nebraska</p>
        <p>At Nebraska, the ball will be in the hands of the junior Eric Crouch every play. He replaced Bobby Newcombe in the third game last year and led the Cornhuskers to a 12-1 record while becoming the first quarterback to lead Nebraska in rushing (889 yards) and running for 16 scores. A state sprint champion in high school, Crouch is a runner in the purest and, in Big Red Country, most beloved way: he starts the option and more often than not keeps it himself.</p>
        <p>It means he takes a lot of hits, and he had off-season shoulder surgery to alleviate pain that for much of last year prevented him from getting more than three hours of sleep at a stretch. He is perhaps the toughest of this year's college quarterbacks. When Coach Frank Solich decided to put a green jersey on Crouch and make him a no-hit zone in fall practice, the quarterback wondered if the college game was getting a bit soft.</p>
        <p>''It seems like there are few teams anymore around the country who allow their quarterbacks to get hit all year long,'' Crouch said. ''It's a weight off my shoulders, knowing that I won't have to worry about that. Deep down, I would rather be wearing that red jersey instead of the green one, but I can't really argue with the coaches' decision.''</p>
        <p>Texas Has a Controversy</p>
        <p>Finally, this would not be college football season without a quarterback controversy, and in Texas the Longhorns are embroiled in a very public one between the two-year starter, Major Applewhite, and the sophomore Chris Simms, the son of the former Giant quarterback Phil. When Applewhite, who threw for 3,357 yards and 21 touchdowns and was named Big 12 offensive player of the year as a sophomore last season, injured a knee in the Cotton Bowl, the door was open for the 6-5, 210-pound Simms, who banged through it with a terrific spring.</p>
        <p>Coach Mack Brown has not named a starter and says he will begin the season playing both; he wants to see if Applewhite is tentative after surgery last spring, and he wants to see if Simms is as effective in real competition.</p>
        <p>Whoever emerges will have to survive the worst part of college football: thousands of fans have already turned out for the Longhorns' open practices to cheer either Applewhite or Simms.</p>
        <p>Last week, Brown asked Texas fans and the news media not to participate in polls trying to determine the popular choice for the starter's job. He assured them that the Longhorns needed both and reminded them that the goal was to win.</p>
        <p>''These are not professional athletes,'' Brown said, ''and it is not fair to subject them to a popularity poll of unidentified people whose opinion will have no bearing on the situation.''</p>
        <p>College quarterbacks are certainly not pros. Fair or not, however, they will be treated like them as they march their teams through another college season.</p>
