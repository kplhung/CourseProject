        <p>THE TWINS</p>
        <p>By Tessa De Loo.</p>
        <p>Soho, $25.</p>
        <p>This carefully constructed novel, fluently translated by Ruth Levitt, is the Dutch writer Tessa De Loo's first to be published in the United States. ''The Twins'' might have been an extended cliche, if only because its subject -- Nazism and the resistance to it -- has been visited so often in fiction. But De Loo's characterizations do not degenerate into allegory, and ethical questions aren't simplified for the reader's comfort. Twin sisters, Anna and Lotte, orphaned and separated at 6 and now in their 70's, meet by chance at Spa, the Belgian health resort. At the time they were parceled out to relatives, long ago in Cologne, Anna was in good health but Lotte had tuberculosis. The result was that the stronger child was sent to a German farm and the weaker one to a less demanding life in the Netherlands. Their dialogue in Spa is filled with flashbacks, and the contrasts between their lives are striking. While Anna married an SS officer, Lotte conspired with her adoptive family to save a number of Jews from the death camps. What would have happened, Lotte wonders, if the twins' roles had been reversed? Anna's approach to life, and to historical truth, feels raw and unconsidered. Lotte is more sensitive, reluctant to disinter painful memories, but eventually she expresses her views with intelligence and even rage. In one flashback, Lotte narrowly escapes drowning at a family skating party. During their conversations at Spa, Anna remembers that Lotte was always the more musical of the two. ''I only began to sing properly,'' Lotte replies, ''after I had fallen through the ice.''</p>
