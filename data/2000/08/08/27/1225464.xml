      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>RJ Smith's article was as interesting as it was disturbing. However, I think the cultural phenomena it highlighted should not be portrayed as ''revolutionary'' when it is really regressive and painfully traditional in its treatment of women. Smith writes, ''There are plenty of women . . . ready to assume their position in the revolution.'' But this ''position'' requires women to be topless, or to be called whores (''hos''). And men, in this so-called revolution, idolize male figures who are characterized as pimps.</p>
        <p>If a revolution is supposed to be about change and also, even, social improvement, this is anything but revolutionary. And if we have all been sexually liberated, why are sexy women the subject of so much wrath? Or is it fear?</p>
