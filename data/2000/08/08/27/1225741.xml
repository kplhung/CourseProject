        <p>REPLICAS of Max, a small plastic zebra, hang from the stethoscopes of so many pediatricians at the Children's Hospital in Boston that at least one family has asked whether he was the hospital's mascot. But no, Max is a creation of Pfizer Inc., intended to sell an antibiotic called Zithromax. And with Max's help, Zithromax has become a billion-dollar drug in just a few years.</p>
        <p>Pediatricians open their mailboxes to find medical journals wrapped in paper covered with Max's stripes. Zithromax sales representatives hand out stuffed zebras to doctors to help console their young patients. And Pfizer has donated a real zebra to the San Francisco Zoo and invited scores of children to a celebration at which the zebra was named Max.</p>
        <p>Last year, after federal health officials said that other antibiotics were not only cheaper, but worked better for children's ear infections, Pfizer sponsored a season of ''Sesame Street,'' enlisting Elmo, the Muppet, to help in the campaign.</p>
        <p>The sales effort is classic Pfizer. It is also an example of what makes Pfizer both the company that rivals try to emulate and a target of critics who worry that the use of many prescription drugs now has more to do with marketing than with the effectiveness or actual need for a drug.</p>
        <p>Pfizer, based in New York, spends more than any other drug company to advertise to consumers, and its marketing efforts have garnered warnings from federal regulators and  criticism from doctors. In recent months, the complaints have grown, as state and federal officials have blamed aggressive consumer advertising by drug companies in general for the skyrocketing cost of drugs.</p>
        <p>Pfizer, the largest drug maker in America, was probably the first in the industry to transform itself so clearly from a research-driven company to one that operates more like Procter &amp; Gamble, the maker of Tide.</p>
        <p>At Pfizer and a growing number of other drug companies, marketing executives, not scientists, are in charge. William C. Steere Jr., the company's chairman and chief executive, began his career there as a sales representative, marketing the antibiotic Terramycin. Henry A. McKinnell, who will take over when Mr. Steere retires next year, also came from Pfizer's business side.</p>
        <p>In Pfizer's laboratories, marketers work side by side with scientists, even during a drug's early development. Using financial forecasts, the sales executives help to ensure that any drug the scientists are developing has a ready market. Other drug companies use this system, too, but Pfizer says it was one of the first to emphasize it.</p>
        <p>Pfizer says its worldwide army of 20,000 sales representatives is the industry's largest. And while the company has the biggest research budget in the industry, it spends more than twice as much on marketing and administrative expenses.</p>
        <p>Last year, the company spent 39 percent of its $16 billion in revenue on those expenses -- a rate that was about one-fifth higher than the industry average.</p>
        <p>Pfizer brushes aside the concern. In an interview, Mr. Steere said the company's ads were helping to improve the public's health, not only by supplying effective drugs to ailing patients, but also by prompting people long reluctant to go to the doctor to set up appointments. And those appointments, he said, may also lead to detection of other problems: some men who have gone to the doctor to get a prescription for Viagra, Pfizer's popular anti-impotence  drug, have found out they had other medical problems, like diabetes.</p>
        <p>''Direct-to-consumer advertising is a good thing,'' he said. ''We get more complaints about our ads from politicians than consumers.''</p>
        <p>Pfizer's strategy has been so successful that the company expects to set an industry milestone this year --  eight drugs that bring in sales of more than $1 billion each. Six of those blockbuster drugs were discovered in Pfizer's labs or in those of Warner-Lambert, a competitor that it acquired early this year.</p>
        <p>PFIZER is so respected as a marketer that more and more of its sales come from drugs discovered by other companies that have hired Pfizer to help sell their drugs. SG Cowen Securities estimates that Pfizer's revenue from marketing just two drugs discovered by other companies -- Celebrex, a pain reliever from Pharmacia, and Aricept, a treatment for Alzheimer's, from Eisai -- will increase to $2.4 billion by 2004 from $680 million last year.</p>
        <p>Pfizer's need to market so aggressively is, in part, a product of its success. Its strong performance over the last decade has raised investors' expectations, and its acquisition of Warner-Lambert brought together America's two fastest-growing drug companies, only adding to the Wall Street pressure for sales growth. Mr. Steere said this year that Pfizer  planned to increase sales by 13 percent a year through 2002. That means  more than $3.5 billion in new revenue this year, the equivalent of three new blockbuster drugs.</p>
        <p>''We've got to get everything out of a product in a short amount of time,'' Mr. Steere said.</p>
        <p>THERE is no doubt that Pfizer's drugs have helped millions of ailing patients. The company is giving away millions of doses of Zithromax, for example, to developing countries to help stop an eye infection that can lead to blindness.</p>
        <p>But criticism of the company's marketing tactics is growing. Last year, the Food and Drug Administration requested a meeting with Mr. Steere, wanting to discuss the repeated warning letters it had sent to Pfizer. The letters contended that the company failed to follow federal drug-marketing regulations by making claims about certain drugs that could not be supported.</p>
        <p>Pfizer has received 11 warning letters since the end of 1996, including one ordering it to stop using brochures that the agency says improperly implied that Zithromax was more effective than Augmentin, an antibiotic made by SmithKline Beecham. Other drug companies have received more warning letters from the F.D.A., but an agency spokeswoman said it was ''rare'' for a chief executive to be called in for a visit with Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the F.D.A.'s center that approves drugs.</p>
        <p>Two of Pfizer's most vocal critics, Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, a pediatrician at Boston Medical Center, and Dr. Sidney Wolfe of Public Citizen, the consumer group, have complained about Pfizer's Zithromax campaign to Donna E. Shalala, the secretary of health and human services. The two doctors had obtained an internal Pfizer document that listed a toll-free phone number for pediatricians to call if they wondered whether to prescribe Zithromax to children. When they called, they heard recorded advice from Dr. Russell Steele, vice chairman of pediatrics at Louisiana State University's school of medicine. He said, among other things, that most children's ear infections would be cured with a drug like Zithromax.</p>
        <p>The Pfizer internal document said the purpose of the recorded advice was to ''counter'' recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that were published in early 1999. Those guidelines said other antibiotics were more effective than Zithromax at curing children's ear infections.</p>
        <p>IN their complaint, Dr. Sharfstein and Dr. Wolfe argued that part of the advice from Dr. Steele, whose university had received a payment from an advertising company hired by Pfizer, was not based on prevailing scientific evidence.</p>
        <p>''There is even more evidence now that Zithromax does not work for many kids,'' Dr. Sharfstein said. ''It just prolongs pain and suffering for many kids and is much more expensive than the other medications.'' He  said, however, that he believed Zithromax was effective in treating pneumonia.</p>
        <p>Dr. Steele said that he disagreed with the C.D.C. recommendations, and that he stood by what he said on the recording.</p>
        <p>Pfizer says any problems that regulators found with its marketing were isolated incidences that were corrected immediately. J. Patrick Kelly, the vice president for worldwide marketing, said the company had investigated the two doctors' complaint but did not find that it had done anything wrong. Mr. Kelly said that Pfizer regularly gives grants to outside experts to talk about its drugs as part of educational programs for doctors, but that the experts give their own opinions. ''We don't control the personal opinion of doctors,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Michael W. Dunne, director of clinical research for Pfizer's anti-infective drugs, said the company had conducted studies comparing Zithromax to all drugs recommended by the C.D.C. panel and found that Zithromax was just as effective.</p>
        <p>Aggressive marketing of any antibiotic, whether made by Pfizer or its  competitors, is increasingly controversial. C.D.C. officials say they fear that overuse of antibiotics is threatening the public's health as more bacteria become resistant to the drugs. But to drug companies, limiting the sale of an antibiotic would be altruism that would not be good for the bottom line.</p>
        <p>''There is a conflict between the public health interest and the industry's interest,'' said Dr. Scott Dowell, the C.D.C.'s acting associate director for global health, speaking about all drug companies. ''The industry is concerned about resistance, but they need to sell their drugs.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kelly said Pfizer was monitoring which bacteria have become resistant to Zithromax. So far, he said, Zithromax is holding up better than many other drugs. It is now the nation's top-selling branded antibiotic.</p>
        <p>In its marketing efforts, Pfizer has addressed the government's concerns about antibiotic resistance, Mr. Kelly said. Company advertising, for example, has urged parents not to demand a prescription for an antibiotic from the doctor if a child's ear infection is caused by a virus -- a practice that is contributing to antibiotic resistance.</p>
        <p>Pfizer has acknowledged a downside to advertising. While Mr. Steere contends that advertising has benefited consumers, he said it had also helped make the industry a new corporate demon in some people's eyes.</p>
        <p>''We used to be invisible,'' he said, ''but now we're very visible.''</p>
        <p>SINCE its founding in 1849 by Charles Pfizer and his cousin, Charles Erhart, in Brooklyn, Pfizer has had a knack for getting people to take more medicine. They  had their first breakthrough when they took a bitter treatment for parasitic worms, blended it with almond-toffee flavoring and shaped it into a candy cone.</p>
        <p>Pfizer's presence in antibiotics dates to just before World War II, when the company found how to produce penicillin in mass quantities. And in the late 1940's, Pfizer's scientists discovered Terramycin, which went on to become a top seller. When the drug was approved by the F.D.A. in 1950, eight Pfizer sales representatives were waiting for word at pay phones across the nation.</p>
        <p>The company has been building its sales force ever since. Even during the early 1990's, amid the uncertainty over managed care and President Clinton's plan for a national health care system, Mr. Steere took a gamble by hiring people when other drug companies were firing them.</p>
        <p>With the Warner-Lambert merger, Pfizer now has 8,000 sales representatives in the United States alone, the most in the industry.</p>
        <p>Pfizer plans to spend about $4.7 billion this year on research -- an amount that is more than the budget of the National Science Foundation in Washington. The company's 12,000 scientists are focused both on finding drugs and, with the help of sales experts, creating an ever greater market for them.</p>
        <p>At the main laboratory in Groton, Conn., the scientists call that teamwork ''Cram,'' for ''Central Research Assists Marketing.'' About 25 percent of Pfizer's research money finances clinical studies of drugs that Pfizer is already selling. These studies, known as Phase 4, are common in the industry and are conducted after the F.D.A. approves a drug.</p>
        <p>Aimed at increasing the sales of existing drugs, Phase 4 studies try to show that the company's drugs can be used by patients suffering from other illnesses or that they work better than competitors' drugs. In effect, they try to expand the claims that Pfizer's sales representatives can make about the drugs.</p>
        <p>''You can't promote a feature of a drug unless you've proven it,'' said Dr. John F. Niblack, Pfizer's top scientist and vice chairman.</p>
        <p>Outside the lab, Pfizer is also working hard to supplement its products. It has aggressively wooed other companies that are developing new drugs, asking to let Pfizer help sell them. In fact, of the four drugs in Pfizer's pipeline that the company estimates could become billion-dollar-a-year sellers, two were discovered by other companies. In a recent report, McKinsey &amp; Company, the consultants, called Pfizer ''superior'' at getting these contracts. Indeed, the antibiotic that became Zithromax was discovered by Pliva, a company in Zagreb, Croatia. Pfizer's scientists came across Pliva's patent in 1981 in a search of records at the United States Patent Office. The companies soon signed a licensing agreement.</p>
        <p>The drug fascinated Pfizer's scientists because, in experiments, it stayed in the body tissue of animals longer than other antibiotics.</p>
        <p>Pfizer's marketers quickly realized that the science behind Zithromax would make great ad copy. Gene Michael Bright and Arthur E. Girard, two Pfizer scientists involved with early work on the drug, recalled how the marketing executives decided to send them to international conferences to talk about it years before it was approved.</p>
        <p>At the suggestion of Pfizer's marketers, the scientists repeatedly used snappy phrases like ''the tissue is the issue,'' Dr. Bright said, to deliver the message that Zithromax would be a powerful new drug.</p>
        <p>When Zithromax was approved in 1992, Pfizer's marketing message changed to focus on consumers. Because the drug stays in the body so long, patients need fewer doses than they would of other antibiotics. Pfizer's marketers knew that this would be a great selling point to parents struggling to get sick children to take medicine. The marketing message became ''just five doses and you're done.''</p>
        <p>Although Zithromax is approved for use in adults with pneumonia and other illnesses, Pfizer's marketers have focused much of their effort on millions of children who get ear infections. Federal statistics show that almost two-thirds of children under 5 get an acute ear infection every year.</p>
        <p>When the pediatric formulation of Zithromax was approved in 1995, Dr. Candice E. Johnson was a pediatrician at a clinic at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. She said her clinic ''was wallpapered with Zithromax zebras'' supplied by Pfizer sales representatives.</p>
        <p>Dr. Johnson, now a pediatrics professor pediatrics at Children's Hospital in Denver, recalled how Pfizer representatives had distributed rubber ink stamps to doctors so that writing a prescription required only a quick stamp and signature. She became upset, she said, when she found that emergency-room doctors were prescribing Zithromax for illnesses like strep throat, which could  be treated with less powerful medicine.</p>
        <p>A FEW years ago, she said, she asked to give a talk to the emergency-room personnel on the proper use of antibiotics. But before she spoke, a Zithromax sales representative was allowed to hand out pens and calendars, make a five-minute presentation and pay for the breakfast buffet. ''It really disturbed me,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Pfizer says its use of a zebra to promote Zithromax is typical of the industry's approach to marketing pediatric drugs. SmithKline Beecham, for example, uses ''Auggie the Froggie'' to market Augmentin, and Abbott Laboratories uses a bulldog called Bix to sell Biaxin. Both drugs  compete with Zithromax.</p>
        <p>Concerned early last year about the growing resistance of bacteria to drugs, a C.D.C. panel of doctors recommended which antibiotics should be used to treat children's ear infections. The panel recommended that a pediatrician's first choice should be amoxicillin, which has been used for years. As a second choice, the panel recommended several drugs made by Pfizer's competitors.</p>
        <p>Dr. Dowell, the C.D.C. official, said the panel did not recommend Zithromax because most studies had shown that it was not as effective as the recommended drugs against the bacteria that is the leading cause of children's ear infections, if that bacteria had become resistant. A growing number of ear infections are caused by resistant bacteria, he said.</p>
        <p>''We still stand by the recommendations,'' he said. ''The studies that have come out since have supported them.''</p>
        <p>But Pfizer moved quickly to offset the recommendations. Soon after they were published, Pfizer paid the Children's Television Workshop to sponsor a season of ''Sesame Street,'' running 15-second Pfizer announcements at the beginning and end of each show.</p>
        <p>Then, in an unusual partnership, Pfizer and the Children's Television Workshop produced a video featuring Elmo going to a doctor with an ear infection. Zithromax was not mentioned in the video, which was distributed to doctors and child care centers, but the drug was advertised on a Pfizer Web site, KidsEars.com, where the video was also given away in a drawing.</p>
        <p>''We used something kids love,'' Mr. Kelly said, ''to get them past something they don't like.''</p>
        <p>Pfizer also paid for a children's health magazine that was produced by the Children's Television Workshop and included Zithromax ads.</p>
        <p>What happened next is open to interpretation. The latest sales statistics suggest that the C.D.C.'s recommendations could be changing pediatricians' minds. In the first half of this year, Zithromax sales fell 10 percent, compared with the corresponding period last year. And prescription statistics show that amoxicillin prescriptions began to climb in 1999 after declining for years.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Kelly of Pfizer said Zithromax prescriptions fell because the flu season was shorter this year than last, and total sales of all antibiotics declined. Zithromax continues to gain market share, he said.</p>
        <p>To make sure it does, Pfizer is working on two new formulations for children, including one that would require only one dose to treat an ear infection instead of five.</p>
        <p>The company is also working on a clinical study that could create a huge new market for the drug. The study, nicknamed the Wizard trial, is looking at whether the antibiotic could become part of the treatment for heart disease, the leading cause of death among Americans.</p>
        <p>Mr. Steere said the study was an expensive, high-risk gamble. ''But if we win,'' he said, ''we win big.''</p>
