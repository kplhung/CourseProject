        <p>Jessica Sung clutched the chain-link gate and stared at the river. About a dozen people were putting kayaks into the water at Pier 26 in TriBeCa. The air was crisp, the skies blue. All this had inspired Ms. Sung to get up early on a Saturday morning, but not early enough.</p>
        <p>Her face pressed against the gate, she pleaded with the river guide to let her join the group.</p>
        <p>The guide, John Nocera, glared at her. People always did this. They arrived late, after the gate was shut at 8 a.m., and expected to go on the trip.</p>
        <p>''Have you been kayaking before?'' he asked Ms. Sung and her friend Metta Murdaya.</p>
        <p>The women looked at each other.</p>
        <p>''This is a long trip,'' Mr. Nocera said. ''We go to the Statue of Liberty and back.''</p>
        <p>''We've been white-water rafting,'' Ms. Sung said. ''Does that count?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Nocera sighed in exasperation. But there were still two open slots, and he was in a generous mood. He unlocked the gate and told the women to dump their belongings in a locker, fill up bottles of water and put on life vests. Then he asked them to sign a sheet of paper.</p>
        <p>''This says that if you drown, you can't sue us,'' he said.</p>
        <p>And so began another paddling trip on the Hudson River. The excursions are run by volunteers from the Downtown Boathouse, a building on Pier 26 that houses dozens of kayaks belonging to paddlers in New York. Few would mistake the Hudson for the coastline of Baja or the rapids of Nepal. But every weekend morning from May to September, weather permitting, experienced kayakers lead 14 people on a three-hour run across its waters. Depending on the tides, they head to Liberty Island or upriver to the U.S.S. Intrepid, docked near 46th Street.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, more than two dozen people show up for the 14 spots. After word caught on about the trips, which began in 1995, people started arriving at 5:30 a.m. Fistfights broke out a few times. So last year, the boathouse started a lottery system.</p>
        <p>''That's the most difficult part of the trip,'' said Tim Gamble, secretary of the boathouse. ''People get upset. There's high anxiety.''</p>
        <p>Not so a week ago Saturday. No more than the maximum number of people had turned out. And of those, most had paddled before.</p>
        <p>The group bobbing in the river included two photographers, a chef and a tourist from San Antonio. Water lapped the sides of their boats, sometimes splashing inside. Every now and then, it resembled dishwater drained from the kitchen sink.</p>
        <p>''There are a couple things you should watch out for,'' said Mr. Nocera, a lawyer. ''Piers, ferries and speedboats. And if you fall into the water, always hold onto your paddle, because you'll need a way to get back.''</p>
        <p>The kayakers' hands curled a little tighter around their paddles, and they began following Mr. Nocera like ducklings across the Hudson. They stroked madly. Water splashed into their faces and sweat ran down their brows. The current helped push them toward Liberty Island without threatening to overturn the boats.</p>
        <p>Near the New Jersey shore, they paused to let a Circle Line ferry glide past. Its green-and-white hull dwarfed the paddlers. Sitting in the kayak felt a little like being an ant on a floating leaf. Speedboats raced up and down, though none came close to the paddlers.</p>
        <p>''If a guy with a couple of daiquiris in him comes by, you're dead meat,'' John Staples, a boathouse volunteer, warned a straggler.</p>
        <p>The current incarnation of the Downtown Boathouse was founded in 1995, when paddlers heard that city and state transportation departments had condemned the pier. They persuaded the agencies to lend it to them on the conditions that they clean it up and provide free kayaking for the public.</p>
        <p>That meant having kayaks on hand for people to take out for half-hour runs and for leading trips along the river. The number of people using the 30 or so public boats in the summer has surged, to 11,000 last year from 100 in 1995.</p>
        <p>Although few mishaps have occurred on the kayak trips, Christopher Howard, a founding guide, recalled one bad run in 1997. As the paddlers neared Ellis Island, a small Cessna fell from the sky into the Hudson, right behind them. One woman burst into tears.</p>
        <p>Mr. Howard ended up towing the weakest paddler back to shore and leading the group a quarter-mile out of the way to avoid the wreckage.</p>
        <p>But on Mr. Nocera's trip, there were no aerial accidents. The kayakers rested in the water in the shadow of Lady Liberty. Seeing her and the Manhattan skyline from this perspective was like looking at them with virgin eyes. The kayakers paddled around the island, beneath a low bridge and into a sheltered cove on the New Jersey shore, where they clambered out of the boats.</p>
        <p>A few said they were grateful that they had gotten this far. Their muscles burned. They gulped bottled water. ''At some points, it's hard work,'' said Liz Maxwell. ''My shoulders are a little sore; my arms are a little sore.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Sung held her glasses up to the sun. They were splattered with brown muck. It looked like the kind of dirt that would require industrial-strength cleanser.</p>
        <p>''This trip seems like an insider thing,'' she said to Ms. Murdaya.</p>
        <p>''What determines insider?'' Ms. Murdaya asked. ''If it's not in the tourist books?''</p>
        <p>''I guess so,'' Ms. Sung said. ''Or if it's not in the newspaper.''</p>
