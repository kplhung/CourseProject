        <p>Standing on 135th Street by the Willis Avenue Bridge recently, Felix Villalona wiped the sweat off his brow, looked up momentarily at the steady river of cars crossing from Manhattan to the Bronx, picked up his machete and got to work.</p>
        <p>With the point of his machete, he speared a coconut from a box in the back of his beat-up Chevrolet van and placed it gently on a table teeming with mangos, bananas, guavas, papayas and other tropical fruits, then repeated the process until the box was empty.</p>

        <p>Standing on 135th Street by the Willis Avenue Bridge recently, Felix Villalona wiped the sweat off his brow, looked up momentarily at the steady river of cars crossing from Manhattan to the Bronx, picked up his machete and got to work.</p>
        <p>With the point of his machete, he speared a coconut from a box in the back of his beat-up Chevrolet van and placed it gently on a table teeming with mangos, bananas, guavas, papayas and other tropical fruits, then repeated the process until the box was empty.</p>
        <p>One of many exotic fruit and juice vendors throughout the city, Mr. Villalona, who is in his 40's, has set up his stand here in the Bronx every day of the week through the spring, summer and fall for 16 years. Strategically located in plain sight of thousands of passing drivers, Mr. Villalona has made a living selling the sweet flavors of his native country, the Dominican Republic, since he came to the United States in 1984.</p>
        <p>''The mangos are the best sellers, but you can tell where people are from the fruit they buy and how they want it,'' he said as a car stopped by his stand. The driver inspected the piles of fruit and the juice machine on  the table, which was shaded by a tarpaulin strung between Mr. Villalona's van and a small tree.</p>
        <p>Colombians, for example, like papaya shakes spiced with salt and a splash of hot sauce, he said. Mexicans tend to zero in on the guavas and bananas. And Puerto Ricans prefer the quenepa, a small, lime-colored, pitted fruit whose firm, wrinkled skin reveals a fleshy, reddish pulp from which a sweet liquid is sucked. Iced sugar-cane juice, about $1 for a 16-ounce cup, is also a popular item.</p>
        <p>The vendors in the Bronx buy their wares every day at wholesale prices at the Hunts Point Market or at another market on 149th Street and Third Avenue. Then, they set up on busy intersections. Their season, they say, runs from mid-March to early November.</p>
        <p>The vendors, whose permits allow them to roam to different spots, usually begin to set up at 9 or 10 in the morning and work until sunset.</p>
        <p>While something of an anomaly in New York, the roadside fruit vendors reflect a long tradition in their native countries. Travel brochures for Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, for example, often promote the street-side vendors as the best, and cheapest, way for tourists to get a taste of the tropics.</p>
        <p>''This is how you get your fruit and much of your food at home,'' said Angel Villalona (no relation to Felix), a 71-year-old Dominican immigrant who operates a stand on Bruckner Boulevard and Lincoln Avenue in the Bronx. ''The streets at home are lined with vendors, but it is much more difficult to make a living there, because the fruit is like water.''</p>
        <p>Angel Villalona said he made enough during the vending season here to live in Santo Domingo in the winter and enjoy the fruits of his work, the financial kind. In a good week in the high season, he can make as much as $500, he said.</p>
        <p>''I tell the vendors at home about how much I make here doing what they are doing,'' Mr. Villalona said. ''They all want to come.''</p>
        <p>More and more are coming, vendors say. While the exact number in the city is unknown, vendors say there has been a steady proliferation. There were just a handful of vendors in the early 1990's, they say, but  today there are as many as 100 Dominican vendors in the Bronx alone.</p>
        <p>Every year, the city's Department of Health issues about 4,000 permits for mobile food vendors, including fruit sellers like Mr. Villalona. But the department does not keep records of what individual vendors sell.</p>
        <p>Sandra Mullin, a spokeswoman, said the Health Department did not know the number of sidewalk fruit stands.</p>
        <p>''People ask us how many Chinese restaurants there are in the city, and we don't know,'' she added. ''To us a restaurant is a restaurant and a vendor is a vendor.''</p>
        <p>The fruit sellers say the increase is obvious in the lines at the markets, as well as in their declining profits.</p>
        <p>''I was the first one to sell coconuts in the Bronx, back in 1984,'' Felix Villalona boasted. ''Now, though, there are dozens just in this area alone. They all sell coconuts.''</p>
        <p>The major thoroughfares of the borough, from Fordham Road to Gun Hill Road to 138th Street, have become popular spots for the vendors, who, like air-conditioning salesmen, pray for heat and humidity.</p>
        <p>''The rain and cool weather this year has made it very hard on us,'' Angel Villalona said. ''Fruit is enjoyed better when you are hot.''</p>
        <p>While an increase in competition and fickle weather have made it tougher on Mr. Villalona and his colleagues, their customers are not complaining.</p>
        <p>''These are the flavors and the smells of home,'' said Augustin Rodriguez, who came to New York from Puerto Rico in 1947. ''When I first came here, there were very few places where you could get quenepas, but now, in the last 10 years, the vendors are everywhere, which is good, because when I eat a quenepa, it reminds me of home.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rodriguez, who lives in Marble Hill, says he visits a vendor on Bailey Avenue and West Kingsbridge Road in the Kingsbridge Heights section of the Bronx every day.</p>
        <p>On Bruckner Boulevard and Lincoln Avenue, Angel Villalona has been selling his fruit to passing commuters for 11 years. His nephew, who owns a gas station two blocks away, sends his 10-year-old son, Joybel, over to help during the busy summer.</p>
        <p>Smiling broadly as he fished around for a good coconut for two police officers, Joybel explained that he was in charge of the coconuts at Mr. Villalona's operation, a duty that includes extracting the milk and pouring it into a cup.</p>
        <p>''Coconuts make people happy,'' he said.</p>
