        <p>Is revealing a father's affair to the rest of the family an obligation or a betrayal, especially if the father leaves and the family is plunged into poverty in a gritty neighborhood riddled with problems?</p>
        <p>That is one of the questions explored in ''An Angel Knocks on Hell's Door,'' a 260-page work of fiction by Suze DiPietro that is among the first books being published through an online book store that creates the book and mails it to the consumer. In the near future, Xlibris, the electronic publisher, wants to also make the books available for reading online, said Roland LaPlante, chief marketing officer for Xlibris.</p>
