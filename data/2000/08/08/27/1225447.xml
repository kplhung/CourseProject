        <p>If the boxy, cedar-sided forms of Jay Chiat and Edwina von Gal's weekend house in eastern Long Island evoke the austere simplicity of an old barn, that's because the house is a barn -- at heart, anyway. Although the house is new, its main living space, which is decorated with simple, elegant furniture and art that is anything but rustic, is defined by the rugged posts and beams of an 18th-century barn.</p>
        <p>Chiat, the advertising mogul turned Internet entrepreneur, grew to love the feel of an old barn when he rented the photographer and art patron Adelaide de Menil's house in East Hampton, a compound of converted antique farm buildings. He feared, however, that his idea of a dream house might not be alluring enough for ambitious young Modernist architects like Jane Sachs and Thomas Hut, partners in Hut Sachs Studio. So it was with some trepidation that he told Sachs, ''I want a barn, and it's going to be the smallest house built in the Hamptons in the last 15 years.''</p>

        <p>If the boxy, cedar-sided forms of Jay Chiat and Edwina von Gal's weekend house in eastern Long Island evoke the austere simplicity of an old barn, that's because the house is a barn -- at heart, anyway. Although the house is new, its main living space, which is decorated with simple, elegant furniture and art that is anything but rustic, is defined by the rugged posts and beams of an 18th-century barn.</p>
        <p>Chiat, the advertising mogul turned Internet entrepreneur, grew to love the feel of an old barn when he rented the photographer and art patron Adelaide de Menil's house in East Hampton, a compound of converted antique farm buildings. He feared, however, that his idea of a dream house might not be alluring enough for ambitious young Modernist architects like Jane Sachs and Thomas Hut, partners in Hut Sachs Studio. So it was with some trepidation that he told Sachs, ''I want a barn, and it's going to be the smallest house built in the Hamptons in the last 15 years.''</p>
        <p>He wasn't kidding; the house is only 3,500 square feet, a beach shack by local standards. But Sachs and Hut were game. They tracked down a company that finds and reconstructs old barn structures -- in this case, a Revolutionary War-era Vermont beauty with a 46-foot-long ridge beam and spruce rafters. Its two big hay-door openings (now covered with industrial garage doors) fostered the indoor-outdoor feeling sought by both client and architects, and its bays were wide enough to accommodate the living, dining, and kitchen areas that the structure would contain. (A second building, joined to this one by an entrance hall and corridor, contains the master and guest suites and a gym.)</p>
        <p>Interestingly, the old barn structure isn't really structural here. The architects essentially built a new house around it -- both to satisfy building codes and to allow for insulation -- combining the crispness of modern architecture with the comfort of the vernacular. Joe D'Urso and Tom Flynn were responsible for the house's stylish but livable mixture of contemporary and vintage 20th-century furnishings. And von Gal, a landscape designer known for understatement, made sure that there is a view of the sculptural landscape she created whenever you look outside.</p>
        <p>Which seems to work for Chiat, who says, ''I've had a lot of nice houses, but this is the first one I feel is really home.''</p>
