        <p>Sandra L. Frankel, town supervisor of Brighton, N.Y., just east of Rochester, thinks of dialing 411 as a call for disinformation.</p>
        <p>''When someone uses directory assistance and asks for an individual or a business in the town of Brighton, directory assistance doesn't recognize that location,'' Ms. Frankel said recently. ''It's as if Brighton and other similar communities don't exist to the telephone companies.''</p>
        <p>Erin L. McKelvey, a technology executive in Maryland, is no fan of directory assistance, either.</p>
        <p>''I was trying to order takeout from Bennigan's in College Park and it took nine calls to get the number,'' Ms. McKelvey recalled. ''I got an operator and each time I was getting the wrong number and they kept giving me a different wrong number. They even gave me a residence.''</p>
        <p>Because the whole directory assistance system is a lot more complicated than it used to be, many consumers can attest to tales of woe about calling to find a phone number. Maybe they dialed 411 in Manhattan and could not get a listing for the Empire State Building. Or they called 555-1212 in Los Angeles and were asked to spell Sunset Boulevard. Or maybe they were among the thousands of people each day on the East Coast who heard a ''We're sorry . . .'' recording when they dialed 411 during the recent Verizon Communications strike.</p>
        <p>But anyone hoping for federal or state regulators to step in and fix directory assistance might find their time better spent reading the phone book. By most official measurements, at least, directory assistance is working pretty well.</p>
        <p>The Federal Communications Commission, which receives some 1,900 complaints a day from the public, could count only 15 that had anything to do with directory assistance in the six weeks from the beginning of July to the middle of August.</p>
        <p>And the New York State Public Service Commission, one of the nation's most active state telephone regulators, says that while it has received 8,200 complaints so far this year about phone companies, fewer than three dozen were about directory assistance.</p>
        <p>It is not that there is no problem. It just may be that directory assistance, when it does not work quite right, is one of those vexations of modern life that seldom rise to the level of formal complaint.</p>
        <p>''The degree of frustration I think is the issue,'' said Trip Agerton, who oversees the directory service operators for the BellSouth Corporation, the main phone company in the Southeast. ''If I get a wrong phone number I'm frustrated, but it's not like I had a car wreck.''</p>
        <p>So what is a frustrated consumer to do -- short of punching in numbers at random in hopes of hearing a familiar voice? As it turns out, there are actually some patterns of logic to today's bizarre directory assistance bazaar. And while understanding the underlying structure may not guarantee always getting the right number, it just might help a person navigate the network.</p>
        <p>The place to start is with the industry's glowing report cards.</p>
        <p>Verizon, the nation's biggest local phone company -- whose unions ended an 18-day strike last week -- says that data compiled before the strike indicates that the average time spent on hold by each of its nearly three million daily directory assistance callers in the area formerly served by Bell Atlantic declined from 5.5 seconds in 1996 to 3.6 seconds this year -- or, collectively, 65 fewer years on hold this year than four years ago.</p>
        <p>The trouble with the data compiled by big phone companies like Verizon is that it may cover a receding portion of the billions of directory assistance calls that Americans make each year. As more of the telecommunications industry has been deregulated in recent years -- bringing waves of competition in everything from pay phones to home phones, business phones and cell phones -- hundreds of companies around the country are now providing directory assistance. And they are doing so with varying degrees of accuracy and efficiency.</p>
        <p>After the breakup of AT&amp;T's Bell System in 1984 and before 1996, almost all directory assistance calls were handled by the big local phone companies. Callers would dial 411 or 555-1212 to reach a local operator. And for a long-distance number, they could add an area code to 555-1212 and reach an operator actually in that area.</p>
        <p>Even now, dialing 411 from home or office, or a pay phone run by the main local phone company, still generally reaches a local operator. But other pay phone providers sometimes farm out directory assistance calls to companies that may cover many cities and states. And some corporations link their office phone systems to a carrier other than the dominant local phone provider, which means a 411 call might connect to an operator across the country who is looking up numbers from a national database.</p>
        <p>As for long-distance number inquiries, that game changed radically about four years ago when AT&amp;T, the No. 1 long-distance carrier, began intercepting its customers' long-distance calls to 555-1212. So now, a caller in, say, Miami who dials (415) 555-1212 will not reach a Pacific Bell operator in the San Francisco area. Instead, the caller may well be routed to an AT&amp;T subcontractor in Phoenix.</p>
        <p>''We wanted to run that business in a particular way and any time we wanted to make a change, we had to negotiate with 25 different companies,'' explained Howard E. McNally, AT&amp;T's senior vice president for consumer services. ''We couldn't guarantee a consistent experience by sending those calls to 25 different carriers.''</p>
        <p>The other major long-distance carriers, including WorldCom and Sprint, have done essentially the same thing.</p>
        <p>The wireless phone industry, meanwhile, operates under its own system. A wireless subscriber who dials 411 is generally connected to a directory assistance operator affiliated with his wireless carrier. Those operators generally use a national database.</p>
        <p>But no one disputes that the quality of directory assistance service varies from provider to provider.</p>
        <p>The listings themselves are generally compiled and controlled by the roughly 1,300 individual local phone companies around the country. Big carriers like AT&amp;T and Verizon contract with outside companies to pull together phone listings from the multitude of local phone databases around the nation. To save money, other, smaller companies, may sometimes try to compile listings by scanning phone books, property records or other sources that are less likely to be up to date and reliable.</p>
        <p>All in all, big phone companies say that directory assistance listings are about 95 percent accurate. But if there are, by some estimates, three billion directory assistance calls in a year (the actual figure may be higher), that adds up to 150 million wrong numbers annually.</p>
        <p>No wonder Louis S. Richman is restive.</p>
        <p>''I think it is a really annoying aggravation that when you call for the headquarters number for a major corporation that you get some branch office delivery dock,'' said  Mr. Richman, finance editor of Consumer Reports magazine, in New York. ''Or you call for a major hospital in a major city and they never heard of it, or a restaurant that you knew was there a week ago but they can no longer find it or you get a fax number.''</p>
        <p>It may help if callers understand that there are gazetteering limitations with today's patchwork directory assistance. And the limitations begin with four words: United States Postal Service.</p>
        <p>Telephone listings are almost always governed by the post office address of the residence or business listed. Take Brighton, the town in upstate New York supervised by Ms. Frankel. A letter to her town must be addressed to Rochester; the Postal Service does not recognize Brighton as an official mailing location. Given this, and the fact that there is another community in New York known as Brighton, near Buffalo, it is understandable that a directory assistance operator in Omaha or elsewhere may become a bit confused.</p>
        <p>But the Postal Service rationale carries little weight with Ms. Frankel. ''I would think that the telephone directory services are something that should be upgraded,'' she said. ''The technology is there to do it.''</p>
        <p>It may depend on which company is wielding the technology. Although the main local phone company for most of New York State is Verizon, the local phone company for the Brighton that is near Rochester, and for Rochester itself, is Frontier.</p>
        <p>In an unscientific test conducted from phones in Manhattan, directory assistance operators for AT&amp;T and Verizon were routinely able to find numbers in Brighton for the Twelve Corners Apothecary, the Bagel Bin Cafe and Ms. Frankel's two home numbers, too. In most cases, though, the operator would note that the listing was in Rochester.</p>
        <p>And in a second unscientific test,  directory assistance calls placed from Rochester and within Brighton, also succeeded without exception in finding those same numbers. The volunteer tester, Jennifer Leonard, president of the Rochester Area Community Foundation, a charitable group, called various directory assistance services to obtain the listings for the apothecary and Ms. Frankel's residence.</p>
        <p>Ms. Leonard, who lives in Brighton, called a Frontier operator from her office in Rochester, a Frontier operator from a pay phone in Brighton, an operator affiliated with her local phone company, Time Warner Communications, and a Verizon operator from her wireless phone.</p>
        <p>''All of the operators were located in Rochester and all of them had both numbers and had no problem with the location of Brighton, N.Y.,'' Ms. Leonard reported.</p>
        <p>Whether directory assistance in Brighton is as truly bad as Ms. Frankel has found it, or as reasonably good as this informal test might indicate, it is certain that there are many more paths than there used to be to that tantalizingly helpful operator's greeting, ''What listing?''</p>
        <p>With all the variables, it may be that the best hope for a caller -- besides keeping those keypad fingers crossed -- is to be very, very precise.</p>
        <p>''In most cases you can find the one you're looking for,'' said Mr. Agerton at BellSouth, which handles more than 500 million directory assistance calls a year.</p>
        <p>''But what happens a lot of the time,'' Mr. Agerton said, ''is someone calls and says, 'I want Bill Smith in Roanoke, Va.' And so you pull it up and there's Bill Smith, so you put them through. But then they call back and in fact they wanted William T. Smith on Lovers' Lane.''</p>
