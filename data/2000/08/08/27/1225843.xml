        <p>The big-name draft choice, running back Ron Dayne, finally looked deserving of a first-round pick. The little-known third-round choice, Ron Dixon, looked like a steal.</p>
        <p>The big-name quarterback, Kerry Collins, completed another game without an obviously poor decision in the pocket, leading the Giants to a touchdown in less than a quarter of play. The new, patchwork offensive line remained, as it prefers, unacknowledged. Which means that it gave up neither a sack nor a penalty.</p>
        <p>The big-name cornerback, Jason Sehorn, knocked the opposing quarterback down on a blitz, then knocked away a pass in tight man-to-man coverage. The besieged cornerback, Dave Thomas, held his ground when he was tested again and again.</p>
        <p>So forgive the Giants if they are not particularly upset about being without a victory in the preseason for the first time since 1971. They chose to see other things besides the score in their 24-17 loss to the Baltimore Ravens on Friday night. Things like the future.</p>
        <p>''The first game that counts,'' Collins said, ''is next Sunday against Arizona. These games don't count.''</p>
        <p>Certainly, it means something when your reserve players lose three first-half leads in four preseason games. It means your reserves are apparently not as good as the reserves from other teams.</p>
        <p>Since no team goes through a season without injuries, the Giants should be worried about how capably those backups will play when they are called upon, as invariably they will be. The backup guard Mike Rosenthal had to play when the starter Ron Stone injured his foot in the first quarter Friday. The good news is Stone's injury is not expected to be serious. The bad news is that Rosenthal was in the game for less than a minute before he committed a holding penalty that nullified a 13-yard pass to Amani Toomer.</p>
        <p>So there are legitimate concerns about depth. Special teams remain a problem because the tackling is poor. The Giants also had a punt blocked. The pass rush is suspect, with no player dominating. But consider the Giants' biggest goals of the preseason: to limit injuries and to get 10 new starters accustomed to playing together.</p>
        <p>A year ago, preseason preparation for the regular season cost the Giants their starting running back, Gary Brown; the planned starting left guard, Lance Scott; the starting left defensive tackle, Robert Harris; and Sehorn.</p>
        <p>This preseason, the Giants had just two injuries of significance. The pass-catching tight end Pete Mitchell will not be back until the second or third game of the season, but free safety Shaun Williams, who has been out the entire preseason with a toe injury, should start against Arizona.</p>
        <p>As for the melding of all those new starters -- six on offense -- they were generally impressive in their limited appearances on the field.</p>
        <p>The Giants' first-string offense was startlingly more efficient. In seven quarters of preseason play, it compiled 785 total yards. That comes to an average of 448.6 yards per complete game, about 128 more than the Giants averaged last season.</p>
        <p>More striking, the Giants' first-team offense converted 15 of 28 third-down situations, or 53.6 percent. Last year, the Giants converted 36.2 percent of their third downs.</p>
        <p>Collins played with patience in the pocket, completing 61 percent of his passes (44 of 72) for 531 yards, with 3 touchdowns and 2 interceptions.</p>
        <p>With 60 yards on 15 carries against Baltimore, Dayne finished the preseason as the leading rusher. He had 211 rushing yards on 61 carries, an average gain of 3.5 yards. For the first time Friday, Dayne played extensively with the first unit and had several runs -- including a 5-yard touchdown -- where he showed poise and good acceleration in tight traffic at the line of scrimmage.</p>
        <p>Dixon had three catches for 48 yards on Friday to go along with a 90-yard kickoff return for a touchdown.</p>
        <p>''There's no question, when he saw the opening on that kickoff, he's got a fifth gear,'' Coach Jim Fassel said.</p>
        <p>Still, some things have not changed offensively. The best offensive player on the Giants in this preseason was the best player in the regular season a year ago.</p>
        <p>Running back Tiki Barber averaged 7.8 yards a carry in the preseason (20 attempts for 156 yards). And Friday, Barber set up Dayne's touchdown run with a 31-yard punt return.</p>
        <p>The Giants' starting defense was not as convincing as the team's offense in showing it has improved on last season's mediocre effort. The defense had three solid games, but a poor game in the loss to the Jets sounded some alarms.</p>
        <p>Jessie Armstead, the leader on defense, said Giants fans should not be worried about the team's defense.</p>
        <p>''The preseason is about getting ready for the regular season and that's it,'' he said. ''And I'll be ready Sept. 3 against Arizona. That's what matters.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Giants Coach JIM FASSEL declined to say if the Giants were interested in signing free safety OMAR STOUTMIRE, who was released by the Jets yesterday. The Giants, who will announce several cuts today, could use more talent at free safety where the current backup, LYLE WEST, is undersized and inexperienced. Also, the Giants' starting free safety, SHAUN WILLIAMS, has been injured this preseason and missed parts of the last two seasons with leg injuries, and has never started a National Football League game. . . . THABITI DAVIS, a free-agent wide receiver invited to training camp mostly as insurance against a rash of injuries, will be the surprise survivor of today's cuts. Davis has vaulted over the fifth receiver, BRIAN ALFORD, the team's 1998 third-round draft pick. Davis, 25, led all wide receivers with 11 receptions and had four special teams tackles. Alford had three catches and no special teams tackles.</p>
