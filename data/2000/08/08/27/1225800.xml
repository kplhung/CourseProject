        <p>The Flags Keep Flying, For Now, at Corner Deli</p>
        <p>A comfortable impasse has been reached in a case that had been brewing into ''the Town of Stratford, Conn., vs. the American Flag.''</p>
        <p>Michael Reekie decorated his Corner Deli with 117 flags, including a squadron of 99 fluttering above the front door. He likes flags. A lot.</p>
        <p>''My father and I are both very pro-America; we think it's a great country,'' he said. ''Where else could you do what we're doing, a father-son thing, a family operation? It just looks very Americano if you drive by here.'' The store has been at that location for 29 years. The father-son combination has owned it for five years.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately for the Corner Deli, town laws prohibit banners and streamers, and last summer the town ordered the deli to take down the flags and fined it $77 for each day it didn't. Michael Reekie said the fines would eventually have been enough to put him out of business.</p>
        <p>A few months later, however, the prosecutor decided not to pursue the case.  ''Right now, the position of the town is that presently, there is no pending enforcement action, either actual or contemplated,'' said Kevin C. Kelly, town attorney.</p>
        <p>But is the deli still in violation of town law? Mr. Kelly referred that question to the zoning commission, where Gary Lorentson, Stratford's planning and zoning administrator, said that a previous lawyer for the town believed the case had been in the wrong court, and that more research had to be done into the legality of the flags.</p>
        <p>It is still the commission's contention that the flags on the streamers are prohibited under the zoning law, he said.</p>
        <p>Things are easing up a bit in town lately. Under regulations adopted two weeks ago that Mr. Kelly said were designed to be more ''business friendly,'' cloth or canvas signs announcing grand openings are now allowed, provided they are displayed for no more than 10 days. And noncommercial  signs and banners, the kind that say ''Welcome to Stratford'' or advertise public events, can be sponsored by businesses, provided their names are printed in letters that do not exceed 12 inches in height.</p>
        <p>And the flag controversy has brought the Corner Deli more than just photographers, reporters and an invitation to appear on Court TV. Since it became famous for its flags last August, business has doubled.</p>
        <p>The Dance Continues For a Ballet Performer</p>
        <p>Last October, Marc Brew, 22, an Australian ballet dancer, performed ''Gilchrist's Dream'' in three noteworthy shows in New York City. He hoped to return, but travel -- and dancing -- are difficult for him. In 1997, just after signing a contract with the State Theater Ballet Company of South Africa, he was in a car that was hit by a driver accused of being drunk. His girlfriend and two other passengers were killed, and Mr. Brew was left unable to walk.</p>
        <p>His appearance last fall was sponsored by Kitty Lunn, founder of Infinity Dance Theater, who also performs from a wheelchair. Now, she has made plans for his return in the spring, after he finishes a project with the Melbourne Symphony. Peter Pucci, the choreographer, will be working on a new piece, and Ms. Lunn wants Mr. Brew to perform in it.</p>
        <p>''Finances are always an issue,'' she said. ''I told him with that, we'd cross those bridges when we got there.'' An anonymous supporter has donated a plane ticket for Mr. Brew, and Ms. Lunn is looking for wheelchair-accessible accommodations for him. ''We're hoping he'll be here indefinitely,'' she said, and mentioned hopes that he could travel with the troupe to Italy for the Pucci piece's premiere.</p>
