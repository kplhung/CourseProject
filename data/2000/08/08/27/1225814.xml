        <p>Joe Andrew, the national chairman of the Democratic Party, said his world had transformed this week. ''Now, my phone calls are getting returned that weren't getting returned,'' he said. ''When everything goes right, everything goes right.''</p>
        <p>By contrast, Gov. John Engler of Michigan, a Republican, said it was sobering to see polls showing for the first time that Gov. George W. Bush's lead over Vice President Al Gore in his state -- a battleground -- had evaporated.</p>
        <p>''I don't think anybody believed or should have believed that somehow the early numbers were reasonable,'' Mr. Engler said. ''They were too big.''</p>
        <p>In barely a week, Republicans and Democrats have switched places in a striking reversal. After looming over the race for months as the man to beat, Mr. Bush suddenly seemed not so invincible. And after months of reinvention, after months of reassuring restive Democrats, Mr. Gore was, if not on top, certainly on the offensive.</p>
        <p>The shift was prompted largely by opinion surveys showing that Mr. Gore had pulled even with Mr. Bush after the Democratic convention.</p>
        <p>But where the contenders stand today is much less important than where they will stand after Labor Day, when voters begin to take closer notice of the campaign. In every presidential contest since and including 1984, the candidate with a clear lead in the polls by Labor Day has won.</p>
        <p>''I'm not ready to sound the alarm at this point,'' said Richard N. Bond, a former chairman of the Republican Party. ''Most Republicans feel this will be a race that's in the margin of error by Labor Day. If it's not, you've got to see where you lost and where Gore gained. And if it's among independents and women, that would be a cause for concern.''</p>
        <p>Another reason to hold off on the alarm is the Electoral College. The Republicans' strength in the South and near West gives Mr. Bush a firm foundation of electoral votes. Whatever the polls say about the popular vote, most strategists agree that Mr. Gore's chances of breaking open a wide Electoral College lead, especially this soon, are not realistic. The campaigns are battling fiercely in important regions, particularly the Midwest, for the 270 electoral votes needed to win.</p>
        <p>Mr. Andrew contended that the Gore bounce would not be fleeting. ''What you do see is a true momentum change here,'' he said. ''Al Gore is now defined not just as his own man, but as a man who stands up for the issues that you care about.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Andrew acknowledged that no one could be sure that the gains would be sustained. ''I don't think anybody can tell you they know anything for certain,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The campaigns do not want to take chances. To shore up the polls by Labor Day, they are planning a barrage of new television commercials and campaign events; in Mr. Bush's case, to get back on the offensive, and in Mr. Gore's, to stay there.</p>
        <p>One explanation for this battle royal more than two months before votes are cast is that perceptions -- of who is ahead and who is not -- are quite consequential in presidential politics. If a candidate is widely viewed as a winner, that can affect everything from fund-raising to news coverage.</p>
        <p>Several Bush campaign officials said they had fully expected Mr. Gore to climb up in the polls after the Democratic convention. But they conceded that they were not prepared for the overwhelmingly positive news coverage he has drawn.</p>
        <p>Such coverage complicates things for Mr. Bush. Many of his weaknesses did not appear as weakness when he was ahead in the polls.</p>
        <p>But this week he found himself on the defensive for behavior that is nothing new in his campaign. News accounts noted his flubbed speech lines and raised questions about his willingness to debate, his plan for a huge tax cut and his party's efforts to run harsh attack advertisements.</p>
        <p>One Bush official in Austin, Tex., said that while he had expected the recent lift for the Gore campaign, he had been startled by the effusive coverage of Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>''If there's something of a surprise,'' the official said, ''it's been how quickly as a whole the media has pivoted from a week ago saying it's a cakewalk for us.''</p>
        <p>A Bush adviser summed up the campaign's position: ''You'd always rather be 20 points ahead, but nothing has happened in the past six weeks or so that hasn't been anticipated by the Bush people. They almost got Gore's bounce right to the number, internally.''</p>
        <p>Day after day, the Gore campaign has essentially driven the media coverage of the campaign for two weeks, from the favorable publicity when Mr. Gore picked Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut as his running mate and on through the Democratic convention -- and beyond.</p>
        <p>Now that things are looking up, some Gore operatives portray their position as a vindication of their political skills and the campaign framework they laid out months ago.</p>
        <p>Just the same, if Mr. Bush does not recover, Republicans may begin to question whether his loyal cadre of top advisers in Texas is really up to running a national campaign.</p>
        <p>Already, prominent Republicans are finding themselves defending Mr. Bush's inner circle.</p>
        <p>''Are the boys from Texas up to it?'' asked Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky. ''This is the most exceptionally run campaign I've ever seen, including Bush '88 and Clinton '92. They're up to it.''</p>
        <p>Yet for all the Bush campaign's potency, it is the same organization whose top officials fully expected the governor to win the New Hampshire primary.</p>
        <p>Scott Reed, who ran Bob Dole's losing presidential campaign four years ago, said he had been struck by excessive confidence within his own party at its convention in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>''A lot of Republicans left Philadelphia with plans to pick out the drapes for their new offices as opposed to running their get-out-the-vote campaign,'' Mr. Reed said. ''There were very few substantive meetings in Philadelphia. They were more poll updates and rah-rah sessions.''</p>
        <p>So for this week, at least, it was the Democrats who were gleefully examining the latest polls.</p>
        <p>''I'm not suggesting that this is a done deal,'' said Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware. ''But the only thing that worries me is somehow, all of a sudden, Al Gore gets kicked in the teeth and it shakes his confidence. I don't know what that would be.''</p>
        <p>Then Mr. Biden offered suggestions of two off-limits areas that the Gore campaign never likes to be reminded of: ''Campaign finance and the Buddhist temple.''</p>
