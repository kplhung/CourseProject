        <p>IT is an irony of modern German history that national unity was achieved just as the nation-state model in Western Europe was being drained of its political content. The vast new Chancellery under construction in Berlin, resembling an outsized ocean liner on the banks of the Spree, has become an object of some mockery partly because the power actually wielded in the building will be slight. European integration, the creation of a euro currency governed by a European central bank and the might of financial markets have made big inroads on national sovereignty.</p>
        <p>As the 10th anniversary of German unification approaches on Oct. 3, it seems clear that this conjunction of recovered German nationhood with a diminished nation state has had some disturbing effects. In the east, patriotism was central to the former Communist state, propagated on the idea that its worker-hero citizens were the superior Germans. Its demise left a spiritual emptiness. People complain they no longer have a heimat -- the emotive German word for home. Some have joined rightist, anti-immigrant movements to defend the ''homeland'' they feel they have lost.</p>
        <p>In the west, some intellectuals and mainstream politicians are questioning the postwar dogma of subsuming Germany's wounded identity in Europe's and confining any patriotism to an almost abstract commitment to the values of freedom and human rights enshrined in the postwar constitution.</p>
        <p>''The fear of foreigners is linked to the dismantlement of the nation-state involved in the construction of the European Union,'' Roland Koch, the Christian Democratic premier of the western state of Hesse, warned recently. He urged Germany to be more assertive in pursuit of its national interests, ''like England and France.'' From a Christian Democrat, a man from the party of that most committed of Europeans, Helmut Kohl, such words amounted to the breaking of a taboo.</p>
        <p>And so the giant of Europe is edging toward its October anniversary in a mood of some agitation, wondering aloud what to do about rightist extremism, pondering where the roots of xenophobia lie, lamenting the misunderstanding between Wessis and Ossis (Westerners and Easterners), groping for a shared sense of German identity that is nonthreatening.</p>
        <p>As Germany mulls over these questions, it might consider the scene in central Chemnitz, an important industrial center of the former East German state where unification has brought the frustrations of 20 percent unemployment and, at a deeper level, the angst of a void. Here an enormous bust of Karl Marx, backed by a mural inscribed with ''Working Men of All Countries Unite,'' stands on a pedestal used by youths in reversed caps clattering around on skateboards. Down the street a Citibank does brisk business and a McDonald's offers a menu in the gruesome mixture of German and English widely known as Denglisch.</p>
        <p>Surveying this jarring scene, Michael Nier, a theorist for the rightist National Democratic Party, shook his head. ''In East Germany, we were a proud state and we wanted to be the better Germany,'' he said. ''Now we are becoming a mere colony of American financial capital, a place that has lost all identity, and every upstanding German should stand up and fight this.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Nier dismissed the skinhead violence against foreigners, calling it the work of ''marginal rightist anarchism.'' But then he developed some angry arguments. The West had destroyed East Germany. In its place, America had set about implanting a multicultural society because ''in a certain chaos, a certain disorientation, it is easier to govern and control people.''</p>
        <p>The German government, in the pocket of big industry with global interests, had no willingness to resist this process, Mr. Nier continued, because ''it has no more concept of Germany.'' So the National Democratic Party would prosper because ''people do not want this leveled world society that speaks English and eats hamburgers'' and because most Germans ''want this to remain our land, not a place with two million Muslims.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Nier's party represents a tiny fringe of opinion -- it has 6,500 members. But in his indignant sense of loss, in his suspicion of the West, he is not an unrepresentative figure of the east. People feel stripped of their pride, reduced, in a commonly heard phrase, to ''second-class citizens,'' which makes them inclined to look for scapegoats, a method dear to Communist states. The easiest person to pick on is, of course, a foreigner.</p>
        <p>The psychological adjustment for Germans in the east has been the more difficult; they were never taught to forswear German national pride as people in the west were. Sandra Breka, who was raised in the southwestern city of Stuttgart, recalled being unable to eat lunch at school after sitting through history lessons where documentary films of Nazi concentration camps had been shown. ''The piles of teeth, the piles of shoes, the piles of bodies, I can see them still,'' said Ms. Breka, 28. ''And every year from fifth grade we saw them. The message, of course, was clear: never again.''</p>
        <p>In the east, however, the message was uplifting, couched in the myth that the Germans of the communist state had resisted Hitler's capitalist regime. The Buchenwald concentration camp was a rite of passage for schoolchildren who, above all, went to see the cell where the chairman of the prewar German communist party, Ernst Thalmann, died in 1944. East Germans could feel proud because they were the true heirs to Thalmann, who became an icon in the east, immortalized as ''a great son of the German people murdered by fascism.''</p>
        <p>And where is that pride today? Even in the west, there are signs of conservative intellectual stirrings among people eager to rediscover a German patriotism, tired of what they regard as the blackmailing of an American-dominated ''Holocaust industry,'' convinced that Germany has paid and done enough to atone.</p>
        <p>The recent award of one of Germany's most prestigious literary prizes to Ernst Nolte, a historian who has argued that Nazism was a riposte to Bolshevism in a European civil war, was one sign of this trend. Speaking in June, Mr. Nolte said the politically correct argument for ''an unstoppable transition toward world civilization'' was dangerous, and the collective guilt imposed on Germany since 1945 was unacceptable.</p>
        <p>A decade ago, at unification, Mr. Kohl accepted that German guilt. He abandoned any claim to formerly German lands in Poland; he abandoned the beloved mark for the euro. These were the clearest signs he could give Germany's nervous allies that this newly united state would be unthreatening because its identity lay in a Europe at peace. But if the allies were happy, it is now clear that not all Germans were. For the long-awaited unification gathered them suddenly in a big country committed to the noble, but scarcely stirring, aim of being a unit of the European Union.</p>
