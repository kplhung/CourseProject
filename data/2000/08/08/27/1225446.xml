      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>CLOSE TO THE WIND, by Pete Goss. (Carroll &amp; Graf, $15.95.) Competing in a round-the-world single-handed yacht race, the author (at right) ended up rescuing a fellow sailor and battling six-story waves. Writing here last year, Barbara Lloyd said, ''You are immersed in his passion.'' Another disastrous ocean race, off Australia, is recounted in KNOCKDOWN: The Harrowing True Account of a Yacht Race Turned Deadly, by Martin Dugard (Pocket Books, $13.95). This is ''a melodramatic but nonetheless riveting chronicle,'' Elizabeth Hightower said here in 1999, ''a story that simply won't let go.''</p>
        <p>A CERTAIN AGE, by Tama Janowitz. (Anchor, $13.) The Hamptons are the setting for the tragicomic story of a young woman of diminished prospects who sees marriage to a wealthy man as the only thing that can save her. The novel ''offers nimble commentary on the mating scene and upmarket beach house architecture,'' Henry Alford wrote in these pages last summer.</p>
        <p>A SEASON IN THE SUN, by Roger Kahn. (University of Nebraska, $12.95.) The author of ''The Boys of Summer'' traveled the nation in mid-1976, talking baseball with players at various levels, from small-college teams to World Series champions. ''My only complaint against 'A Season in the Sun' is its length -- there isn't enough of it,'' Donald Hall said in the Book Review in 1977. The University of Nebraska Press has also reissued Kahn's GOOD ENOUGH TO DREAM ($15.95), about his year as president and part owner of the low-minor-league Utica Blue Sox. This ''incongruous owner'' is ''a skilled storyteller who was presented with a lifetime's supply of colorful characters,'' Bob Ryan wrote here in 1985. Both books have new afterwords by the author.</p>
        <p>A RAGE TO LIVE: A Biography of Richard and Isabel Burton, by Mary S. Lovell. (Norton, $19.95.) An eminent, or perhaps notorious, Victorian, Sir Richard Burton was an explorer, scholar and linguist who translated the ''Kama Sutra'' and slipped into the forbidden city of Mecca, in Arab disguise. This is ''an extraordinary biography,'' James R. Kincaid wrote in the Book Review in 1999. The author shows Isabel Burton to be ''as resolutely tactless as her husband but also as courageous, defiant and smart.''</p>
        <p>CHARLOTTE GRAY, by Sebastian Faulks. (Vintage International, $14.) This novel follows a Scottish woman's journey into Nazi-occupied France during World War II to find a missing R.A.F. pilot. ''What is essentially a love story turns into a sensitive, powerful reflection on moral anguish in Vichy France,'' Anita Gates said in these pages last year.</p>
        <p>PARADISE, NEW YORK, by Eileen Pollack. (Temple University, $17.95.) In a coming-of-age story, a young woman tries to save her family's crumbling Catskills resort and falls in love with the reclusive handyman, who is black. ''Pollack's first novel succeeds, sometimes too didactically, in taking on such large themes as racism and bigotry, love and loyalty,'' Ruth Coughlin wrote here last year.</p>
        <p>MURDER DUET: A Musical Case, by Batya Gur, translated by Dalya Bilu. (Harper Perennial, $14.) The cerebral Israeli policeman Michael Ohayon returns in the fourth in a series of mysteries, this time investigating the murders of classical musicians. ''Gur's introspective detective unravels her complicated plot with his usual intelligence,'' Marilyn Stasio said in the Book Review last year. ''But for pure reading pleasure, nothing touches the smart discussions on music and art.''</p>
        <p>A THIRST FOR RAIN, by Roslyn Carrington. (Kensington, $12.) The lives of neighbors who share a cramped communal yard intersect and collide in this first novel, set in the hills of Trinidad during a four-month drought. ''The stage will be washed clean but the strains of Carrington's powerful redemption song will linger,'' Anderson Tepper wrote in these pages in 1999.</p>
        <p>BOMBSHELL: The Life and Death of Jean Harlow, by David Stenn. (Lightning Bug Press, $24.95.) The brief career of a Hollywood legend who was both sex symbol and comedienne is recounted in a well-documented biography, with a new section of previously unpublished movie stills. ''Without judgment and without smacking his lips . . . Stenn tells how Harlow's life had run amok even before she became a star,'' Jeanine Basinger said in the Book Review in 1993. Another Hollywood biography by the same author is CLARA BOW: Runnin' Wild (Cooper Square, $21.95), which contains a new filmography. Bow's sex appeal brought her the title of the ''It'' girl, but she was a has-been by the age of 25. ''This is a touching portrait of a sad and turbulent life,'' Sharon Shervington wrote here in 1988.</p>
