        <p>In ''Epitaph for a Rule That Just Won't Die'' (Economic View, July 30), Louis Uchitelle examined the problems in estimating the Nairu, or nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment, traditionally defined as the lowest level of unemployment compatible with price stability.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''Epitaph for a Rule That Just Won't Die'' (Economic View, July 30), Louis Uchitelle examined the problems in estimating the Nairu, or nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment, traditionally defined as the lowest level of unemployment compatible with price stability.</p>
        <p>As the column noted, the drop in unemployment to 4 percent has not caused much inflationary pressure -- contrary to past experience. The phenomenon raises the question of whether a Nairu even exists today.</p>
        <p>Maybe this is not the right question. Instead, we should ask whether the national unemployment rate is any longer the relevant determinant of inflation. Previous articles have indicated that capital mobility from high to low wage areas in the United States has dampened wage increases. If that is correct, we can assume that capital flows abroad, accompanied by trade liberalization, can have a similar effect.</p>
        <p>Because these international flows extend the labor market beyond national boundaries, it would seem that the international unemployment rate should have a stronger relationship to inflation than the national one. A high international rate might be the reason for the apparent price stability in the United States.</p>
