        <p>AUDITIONING for membership in the Long Island Mystics, Ben Cohen conjured up his latest trick.</p>
        <p>Pick a card, any card, the 27-year-old Orthodox rabbinical student told Vipul Sawhney, 23, a software engineer who stopped by the latest monthly meeting of the magicians' group at the Copiague library just to watch.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen took the four of clubs and ripped it in quarters. ''Do you believe in the healing powers?'' he asked, instructing Mr. Sawhney to close his hand over the pieces. ''I once worked as a dry cleaner,'' Mr. Cohen deadpanned, lightly touching the back of Mr. Sawhney's hand as if he were waving a magic wand. ''I learned a little lesson, it's called steam cleaning.'' Slowly, Mr. Sawhney, of Copiague, opened his fist. Back in one piece, the playing card had nary a ripple or bend.</p>
        <p>Feats impossible to explain! Wonders that cannot be denied! Was it deception? Illusion? Or just sleight of hand?</p>
        <p>By order of Merlin and the allure of enchantment, the 29 Houdinis who had gathered to share their tricks -- but not their secrets -- wouldn't tell.</p>
        <p>Conjuring is said to be the second oldest profession and perhaps the oldest of the theatrical arts. On Long Island, there are four magic societies, also including two rings of the International Brotherhood of Magicians and The Grumman Club, a 42-member learning group.</p>
        <p>''Magic is riding a wave right now,'' said Mike Maione, president of the 60-member Mystics, a local assembly of the Society of American Magicians, whose members have included Harry Houdini, David Copperfield and Harry Blackstone Jr. The club is dedicated to elevating the art of magic through lectures, performances and discussions, promoting harmony among highly competitive magicians and safeguarding its mystery. Though admission requirements are not as strict as for the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, known magicians as well as hobbyists have to try out.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen, of Far Rockaway, is the president of the Glen Cove chapter of the International Brotherhood of Magicians and frequently does magic at bar mitzvah celebrations.</p>
        <p>Mitch Goodkin, a chiropractor with a home office in Merrick, was 6 years old when his grandfather first taught him magic. By the time he was 12, he was performing professionally.</p>
        <p>''I think magicians maintain a sense of wonder that a lot of people tend to lose in the hustle-bustle,'' said Dr. Goodkin, 36. Moments earlier he had pulled yards and yards of multicolored rope from his mouth and stretched it across the room, creating a rainbow, then plucked a gold coin from the air for the pot of gold at its end.</p>
        <p>''While everybody knows there is no real magic, people are in awe,'' he said. ''They believe just for a split second in magic. That split second, we call it the moment of astonishment. At that moment we don't know if it's real magic or not, and then your rational mind kicks in and you say, O.K., there had to be some trick.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Goodkin invents tricks, critiques other magicians, works with children in the Syosset-based Society of Younger Magicians, has done a one-man show on Broadway and uses tricks in his practice.</p>
        <p>''Everybody is very tense when they go to a doctor,'' he said. ''Some doctors have soothing music. Some doctors have aromatherapy. Some have massage therapy. I do magic to relax my patients. It puts a light atmosphere on the office.''</p>
        <p>He'll take the paper off the examining table, rip it up and bring it back together again. Before patients have their lumbars adjusted he'll pull quarters out of their ears, Tootsie Rolls from their noses and streamers out of their sleeves.</p>
        <p>Joe Silkie, 43, a graphic artist and trick manufacturer from Hicksville, displayed photographs of a train station, a conductor and a train wreck. The wreck occurred, according to the inscription on the back of the picture, on Feb. 15, 1909, at 7:24 a.m. Then Mr. Silkie pulled out a pocket watch and asked Todd Schwartz, a Huntington Station guidance counselor who uses magic therapy to help students, to wind the watch, test its hand movements and close the lid.</p>
        <p>Mr. Silkie opened the watch. It read 7:24.</p>
        <p>''It's the child in people,'' Mr. Silkie said, pleased with the applause. ''It's playing with toys. It's more sophisticated and a lot of people take it more seriously, but you are playing. You are controlling the visual perception of your audience.''</p>
        <p>Unlike most of the Mystics, Al Garber, 43, of Syosset, has made magic a fulltime career. He has been performing for children and adults at local parties, libraries, schools, camps and events for 23 years. He begins each week with a Monday morning show for seriously ill children at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset and has appeared at Westbury Music Fair four times.</p>
        <p>''I love to make people laugh,'' said Mr. Garber. ''I was a little shy to get up in front of people without props. Sometimes I'm more of a comedian than a magician.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Garber said people are intrigued by magic. ''It's like a car accident,'' he said. ''People can't help but watch.''.</p>
        <p>Working the dinner cruises on the Nautical Princess and gambling boats out of Freeport, Arnold Wonsever, 65, a retired businessman, does roving magic.</p>
        <p>''Whether you are 6 or 60, everybody loves magic,'' said Mr. Wonsever, who made the playing cards move by themselves in a trick he dubbed ''the haunted deck.'' ''It's the mirth, the mystery. I have people watch me do close-up. They look from the top. They look from the bottom. They ask me, 'How did you do that?' I tell them I do it very well.''</p>
        <p>Duck's New Look</p>
        <p>As general manager of the Hampton Inn in Commack, Bill Mullaney handles the day-to-day operations of the 144-room hotel. Taking care of guests usually does not involve climbing on top of an oversize wood and cement duck with a paint roller. Nor does it include gardening.</p>
        <p>Except when the hotel chain he works for hatches a $3,500 plan to help restore the Big Duck in Flanders to its original 1932 look, part of a campaign to refurbish treasured roadside landmarks across the country. The Big Duck is on the National Register of Historic Places.</p>
        <p>So instead of worrying about check-ins on a recent morning, Mr. Mullaney, 35, of Sayville, was checking out the Big Duck's neck, first scraping off a buildup of dirt and grime, then giving it a fresh coat of white paint.</p>
        <p>''I paint at home all the time,'' Mr. Mullaney said. ''I just finished the whole house. It was my warm-up for this. I'd hate to make a mistake out here.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mullaney was not terribly familiar with the Big Duck, which houses a gift shop run by Suffolk County Parks and the Friends for Long Island's Heritage and a satellite office of the Long Island Convention and Visitor's Bureau. Mr. Mullaney rarely drives to the East End and had never been in the Big Duck before. Neither had his sales director, Susan Ostrowski, who was sifting dirt for a new flower bed designed to look like the old one in a 1930's photograph of the giant fowl.</p>
        <p>Not to worry. Inside the Duck was Barbara (Babs) Bixby, known as the Duck Lady.</p>
        <p>''It's the darlingest little tourist trap you ever saw,'' said Ms. Bixby, 55, packing duck goodie bags for the squad of hotel employees helping Mr. Mullaney paint and plant 100 flowering cannas and enough New Guinea impatiens to make the Big Duck look like she was nesting in a flower bed. The plants were donated by the Greenhouse Recreation Opportunity Workshop, a horticultural program  for children and adults with autism and developmental disabilities.</p>
        <p>For the past eight years, Ms. Bixby, of Riverhead, has been running the small shop, welcoming thousands of visitors each summer and weekends during the fall. Then she tries to sell them Big Duck ties for $39.95 and Big Duck postcards for 35 cents.</p>
        <p>She also relates the history of the Big Duck. Originally, there was the Big Duck Ranch, a store for fresh Peking duck, duck eggs and duck parts at the edge of a duck farm on Route 24just west of Riverhead. In 1936, the farm and shop were relocated down the road in Flanders. In 1987, Kia and Pouran Eshghi, who then owned it, donated the building to Suffolk County. The shop was moved again to its current location at the entrance to Sears Bellows County Park and refurbished for $50,000 by the Friends for Long Island's Heritage.</p>
        <p>''It's quietly fascinating; the Big Duck is a small wonder,'' said Ms. Bixby, as a historically correct screen door was being fitted into place. ''It takes a special breed of duck lady. You have to have a duck fixation.''</p>
