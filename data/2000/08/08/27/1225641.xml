        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Regarding the article ''Students Play Scientist at a Real Chemical Lab'' [Aug. 20], our son, Ameen, was one of the first participants in the program while he was a student at Ardsley High School. At that time the Ciba-Geigy company had offices in Ardsley and offered an after-school work program. Ameen worked there for two years. But he never thought of himself as playing scientist: he felt that he was doing serious work and was making a real contribution.</p>
        <p>This experience inspired him to choose a career in science. At Colgate University he majored in chemistry and continued working each summer at Ciba-Geigy. Upon graduating, he was offered a permanent position. However, his mentor encouraged him to continue his studies.</p>

        <p>Regarding the article ''Students Play Scientist at a Real Chemical Lab'' [Aug. 20], our son, Ameen, was one of the first participants in the program while he was a student at Ardsley High School. At that time the Ciba-Geigy company had offices in Ardsley and offered an after-school work program. Ameen worked there for two years. But he never thought of himself as playing scientist: he felt that he was doing serious work and was making a real contribution.</p>
        <p>This experience inspired him to choose a career in science. At Colgate University he majored in chemistry and continued working each summer at Ciba-Geigy. Upon graduating, he was offered a permanent position. However, his mentor encouraged him to continue his studies.</p>
        <p>Ameen received his Ph.D. in chemistry and for several years did research in the pharmaceutical industry. He is now employed at one of the largest pharmaceutical companies as a ''medical liaison.'' He loves his work and is proud that through his work he can make a difference in people's lives. Had it not been for the program at Ciba-Geigy I doubt that he would have chosen a career in science.</p>
        <p>I am very pleased to read that Ciba is continuing with the program, and I hope that our son's success story will prove to them how important and successful their program is.</p>
