        <p>(Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)</p>
        <p>A PLACE IN THE COUNTRY, by Laura Shaine Cunningham. (Riverhead, $24.95.) Years of fruitless wishing for the great good place finally paid off for the author with a gracious old house upstate; her wisdom is shown by acknowledging that snakes and bad neighbors go with the territory just as flowers and moonbeams do.</p>
        <p>SYDNEY: The Story of a City, by Geoffrey Moorhouse. (Harcourt, $25.) A virtuoso exposition of Sydney and the social history that has formed it, from the first Europeans and the British convicts through the gold rushes to the variety of today's Asian immigrants.</p>
        <p>A RUM AFFAIR: A True Story of Botanical Fraud, by Karl Sabbagh. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $24.) A grave and witty account of a British amateur botanist who in the late 1940's caught a professor faking evidence to suit his theory about the last ice age and the Hebridean island of Rum, then sealed his report of the fraud in his college library (it leaked anyhow).</p>
        <p>SISTER: The Life of the Legendary American Interior Decorator Mrs. Henry Parish II, by Apple Parish Bartlett and Susan Bartlett Crater. (St. Martin's, $35.) An oral history, compiled by the daughter and granddaughter of the formidably descended aristocrat who went into the decorating business in 1933 and lived a life characterized by robust frivolity and lots of hard work.</p>
        <p>THE QUESTION OF BRUNO, by Aleksandar Hemon. (Nan A. Talese/Doubleday, $22.95.) Mostly fictional (but who can say for sure?) stories and a novella, invoking both the terrible facts of Bosnia and Yugoslavia and the years of the author's childhood, when there was yet hope for both.</p>
        <p>THE GENTLEMAN FROM NEW YORK. Daniel Patrick Moynihan: A Biography, by Godfrey Hodgson. (Houghton Mifflin, $38.) A life of the right's favorite liberal, or the left's favorite neocon, always intelligent, usually correct and at peace with his impending retirement; by a British journalist and longtime friend.</p>
        <p>DREAM STUFF: Stories, by David Malouf. (Pantheon, $22.) Australia, in the short fiction of this collection, is a place of surprises and changing potential where history itself is sometimes in question and characters protest against loss, though the author seems to assure us that nothing is lost forever.</p>
        <p>THE LOST LEGENDS OF NEW JERSEY, by Frederick Reiken. (Harcourt, $24.) The drama of sheer ordinariness receives its celebration in this novel set in northern New Jersey about 1980; the Jewish and Italian families who inhabit it struggle (especially the teenagers) for both stability and poetry.</p>
        <p>TOUCHING PEACE: From the Oslo Accord to a Final Agreement, by Yossi Beilin. (Weidenfeld/Trafalgar Square, $50.) Israel's chief negotiator at Oslo and Stockholm gives a personal account of the secret talks with the P.L.O. that outlined the probable shape of any future Middle East peace, regardless of the outcome of the recent Barak-Arafat-Clinton meetings at Camp David.</p>
