        <p>BOB TASCA Sr. has kicked plenty of tires in his 73 years. He estimates that he, his sons and his grandson, who own a Lincoln-Mercury dealership in Massachusetts and a Ford dealership in Rhode Island, have sold 330,000 cars and trucks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tasca once told Henry Ford 2nd that he made ''lousy cars.'' Since then, Mr. Tasca has made more than 600 assembly-line inspections, telling Ford Motor executives how to fix flaws.

        <p>BOB TASCA Sr. has kicked plenty of tires in his 73 years. He estimates that he, his sons and his grandson, who own a Lincoln-Mercury dealership in Massachusetts and a Ford dealership in Rhode Island, have sold 330,000 cars and trucks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tasca once told Henry Ford 2nd that he made ''lousy cars.'' Since then, Mr. Tasca has made more than 600 assembly-line inspections, telling Ford Motor executives how to fix flaws. He chronicled his exploits in accountability in a book, ''You Will Be Satisfied'' (Harper Business, 1996).</p>
        <p>Since Aug. 9, when Bridgestone/Firestone announced the recall of 6.5 million tires, two-thirds of which were sold new on Ford sport utility vehicles and trucks, customers have flooded Mr. Tasca's service bays, demanding replacements. This week, before leaving to inspect a Ford plant in Detroit, he talked about the recall. Here are excerpts from the conversation.</p>
        <p>JULIE FLAHERTY</p>
        <p>Q. How well has Ford handled the recall?</p>
        <p>A. There was too much hesitation. They kept it hush-hush and didn't bring it out in the open. At the time that they were aware that a problem could have existed, that's when it should have happened. Now we've got all this hullabaloo. When we changed tires in Saudi Arabia, we should have changed tires in Texas. They should have announced it that day. I would have preferred to see anybody with a Firestone tire have the option of changing, but I don't think it's going to happen. They aren't going to be able to produce enough tires.</p>
        <p>Q. What do customers say?</p>
        <p>A. They are fearful of putting their children in the car. When you saw the accidents on the TV and in the newspaper, it didn't look like the chance of surviving was going to be too good. People are saying, ''I don't want to buy a Firestone tire; I don't want to drive a car with a Firestone tire.'' There are people just scared stiff of the name Firestone, which is unfortunate. I've always had good experience with Firestone. I'm driving an Explorer Sport Trac with Firestones.</p>
        <p>Of the 200 [vehicles] we checked, we changed about 36 sets, or 144 tires. I had to change ones that didn't have the defective code, too. I had one elderly lady whose Firestone tires were not that code who said: ''I am not going to drive the car. I'm going to park the car right here.'' So I took the Goodyear tires off another car and put them on hers.</p>
        <p>Q. Is this the biggest crisis you have seen with Ford?</p>
        <p>A. I've had callbacks my whole life. It is probably a scarier callback than most of them, but we've had callbacks where the car can catch fire because the fuel line was not routed properly, callbacks where a bolt was not tempered properly and the front end can fall off. But this will go down in the top 10 percent.</p>
        <p>Q. How long do you expect the clamoring to last?</p>
        <p>A. Today was one-fifth of yesterday. It's tapering off. It could take three or four weeks. It might take some time to convince people that if you've got a Firestone and it's not one of the bad ones, you're O.K. If you can get people to believe that, you're over the last hurdle.</p>
        <p>It's costing me money, between $5,000 and $20,000, but I never worry about what it costs me to satisfy a customer. Obviously I don't want to go bankrupt. But I've been with Ford for 57 1/2 years. It's too late to get divorced now.</p>
        <p>Q. Will the recall frighten people away from Explorers and sport utility vehicles?</p>
        <p>A. I sold nine Explorers the day before yesterday -- that's the biggest Explorer day I've had all year. I changed the tires for Goodyears on two of them. But the people like S.U.V.'s. Sure, they're worried about safety, but we know how to make them safer, we know how to make them more economical, and if that's what the market wants, we'll do it. We're going to see a lot more S.U.V.'s, but they'll be a different type S.U.V.'s. We've got an Explorer, an Expedition and an Excursion -- I don't think we need them all. You'll see the biggest ones trimmed down in size.</p>
