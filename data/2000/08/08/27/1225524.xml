        <p>MARY MARBACH began dating Dr. Anthony Marano in 1953. They were best friends first, then sweethearts. She was struck by his kindness; he, by her vitality.</p>
        <p>Their wedding took place here on Aug. 23, 1958, at the Church of Our Lady of Sorrows on Mamaroneck Avenue. The new Mrs. Marano wore a simple white gown trimmed with pearls; her bridesmaids, she recalled, were in white dresses with cummerbunds the medium blue of the robes ''of our Blessed Mother.''</p>
        <p>Last Sunday, the Maranos' youngest daughter, Michele, married Greg Russo at the same church. They too had dated for five years; they too had made the transition from friendship to love. Like her mother, Michele chose an elegant white dress with simple pearl borders on the hems and cuffs. Sunlight streamed through the blue-and-white stained-glass windows as it had 42 years ago. Except for the fact that her bridesmaids were in pale pink beige, not white, the wedding looked a lot like that of her parents.</p>
        <p>Only now instead of standing nervously at the altar, Dr. Marano, a cardiologist with a practice here, was walking his daughter down the aisle.</p>
        <p>Later, Mrs. Marano, in a long violet dress and carrying a nosegay of flowers, received hugs and kisses from relatives and friends.</p>
        <p>The Maranos are one of those families that are so firmly entrenched in their community that they seem to know everyone. Dr. Marano is not only in private practice but he is also a former chief of cardiology at White Plains Hospital Center, and he is the official doctor for the city's police and fire departments. He grew up in White Plains on South Lexington Avenue; Mrs. Marano grew up at the corner of North Street and Bryant Avenue. In 1928, her father was one of the founders of Our Lady of Sorrows.</p>
        <p>Their three children also chose to stay in the city. Tommy is a detective with the White Plains police, and he and his family live here. Kathy Thompson and her family live here. Michele, who works for a talent agency in Manhattan, and Mr. Russo, a physical education teacher at Anne Hutchison School in Eastchester, will live in an apartment here after their honeymoon in Aruba. And Mr. Russo's parents, Leo, a painting contractor, and Jeanne, a real estate specialist for a technology company, are also White Plains residents.</p>
        <p>All of which added to the wedding's sense of continuity, the flow of the ceremony and the reception at the Westchester Country Club in Harrison.</p>
        <p>One hundred seventy guests mingled on the church steps and the club's terrace, where an hors d'oeuvre table was decorated with two hearts sculptured in ice.</p>
        <p>Flashing a television-style smile of perfect white teeth, Mrs. Russo described the couple's first meeting. Mr. Russo, more quiet in demeanor, with serious dark eyes, listened and smiled.</p>
        <p>''It was at a Halloween party five years ago,'' Mrs. Russo said. ''He was dressed as a vampire, with these fake pointed teeth and his hair all slicked back and a cape. He was in costume, but I noticed that he had the longest eyelashes.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Russo added, ''She was dressed as a gypsy, with a kerchief and hoop earrings.''</p>
        <p>''I liked him right away,'' Mrs. Russo said. ''I'd always hoped to find someone who I could truly be myself with. I talked to him easily, and I was myself with him right from the beginning.''</p>
        <p>There was only one problem: she was scheduled to move to California the next day. She did, but spoke on the phone to Mr. Russo every night. Six weeks later, she decided he was worth moving back East for. They dated steadily; one year ago, on a beach at sunset, he said to her, ''It's hot out, you need a little ice,'' and slipped a diamond ring on the fourth finger of her left hand.</p>
        <p>The newlyweds believe their love will last forever, and both have family histories to back up that wish. Both sets of parents, they say, are inspirations, living proof that near-perfect marriages do exist.</p>
        <p>As for those parents, Jeanne Russo said, ''Communication is important above everything else.''</p>
        <p>Mary Marano said, in essence, the same thing: ''You have to be best friends. You have to always respect each other. My husband was, and still is, the most consistently nice person I've ever known.''</p>
