        <p>AS they approach their freshman year of college, our soon-to-be-unaffordable children give us a taste of expenses to come when we take them to visit the schools that have caught their eye. Some of them are in places that might as well be Timbuktu.</p>
        <p>The wish lists are usually long, involving colleges in different parts of the country, so some parents stagger these exhausting trips over the course of a year -- generally their child's junior year of high school. That can get expensive.</p>
        <p>My neighbors in Connecticut traveled with their daughter this month to visit schools in Chicago, and will go later to California. A family I know in the Midwest hit the Boston area last month, as well as Maine, Rhode Island and Connecticut; they plan to go to Chicago and Indiana  in the fall and California next spring. By using frequent-flier miles and staying with friends, they are keeping the total cost of the trips to about $4,000; the father is even borrowing a video camera to record some of the visits.</p>
        <p>Actually, there is a way that he could have stayed home. Parents can reduce the cost and trouble by taking advantage of videotapes now available for many colleges around the country. Some come from the colleges, and some from independent companies. Some can even be viewed on the Internet. Although most people involved with these videos caution that a tape is no substitute for an actual visit, they do say it is a good way to cull a long list of college choices and save a few stops on that junior-year marathon.</p>
        <p>''If you're considering making a trip that is more than a day's drive away, you might look at the tape to see if it's worth it,'' said Christopher M. Klass, president of the Klass Report of Manhattan, which sells college videos. ''When you get back, you can use the tapes to review and refresh your memory. The videos are also good for people who can't afford to visit the schools.''</p>
        <p>The Klass Report (www.klassreport.com, $19.95 a school) has tapes of 40 colleges, but the company has not shot any new videos since 1997, so some information may be outdated; Mr. Klass said he hopes to add more schools this fall. His tapes are professionally shot, edited and narrated and include topics like student-teacher ratios, on-  and off-campus living arrangements and what there is to do off campus.</p>
        <p>Tapes offered by Collegiate Choice ($15 a tour, www.collegiatechoice.com) are far from professional, and that is part of their charm. They look as if they were shot by someone's dad. And they were.</p>
        <p>Cliff Kramon of Tenafly, N.J., who makes the tapes and is the father of two adult sons, is a salesman for his family's Manhattan clothing company; he travels around the country on business. His wife, Sami, a college adviser, urged him to videotape a couple of college campuses for her during a business trip a few years ago. He now has about 350 tapes.</p>
        <p>He uses a ''you are there'' approach, taping the campus and then recording the tour that the college gives to visiting parents and students. He asks the student guide the kinds of questions a parent would ask; he adds no narration or other comments of his own.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to hear the school say what the student-faculty ratio is; I ask the tour guide,'' he said. ''I want to know how safe the area is. I want to know if the school empties out on the weekend. No school wants to admit it is a suitcase school.''</p>
        <p>Search Communications in Philadelphia (www.searchbyvideo.com, $8 a school) doesn't shoot its own videos; it distributes tapes made by about 300 colleges. The company's Web site also offers the online videos of 10 colleges and plans to add more.</p>
        <p>Joyce E. Smith, executive director of the National Association for College Admission Counseling in Alexandria, Va., said parents should find out what a college offers free before buying a commercially distributed tape.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes parents get caught up in this college transition thing and spend money they didn't have to spend,'' she said. ''There's lots of free good information available from the college if parents just ask.''</p>
        <p>HAVE mixed views about the tapes. I didn't care for the editorial comments in the Klass tapes, but they gave a good view of the college. Collegiate Choice had the most unvarnished approach, but when a tour guide was boring, so was the tape. The tapes offered by the colleges and by Search Communications give a good overview, but they are part of the schools' marketing efforts.</p>
        <p>Some tapes were incredibly dull, but the one for Virginia Tech was so clever, and the student narrators so talented, that I hoped the school would end up as one of my own children's choices.</p>
        <p>So much for culling the list.</p>
