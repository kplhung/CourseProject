        <p>HIS hair is thinner, though still tinted red, and his posture is slightly bent, but certainly not bowed. Harold Farb, the flamboyant Houston apartment developer who gained national attention for his excesses before he fell hard in the 1980's, is back.</p>
        <p>Mr. Farb, 77, has spent the last 15 years selling office buildings and trimming his apartment portfolio by 90 percent, in order to pay off $455 million in debts from real estate deals that went bad when the price of oil hit the skids and took the Texas economy with it. He has also put behind him such costly indulgences as a supper club, where he headlined as a lounge singer, and a glossy magazine catering to Texas's rich and self-absorbed.</p>

        <p>HIS hair is thinner, though still tinted red, and his posture is slightly bent, but certainly not bowed. Harold Farb, the flamboyant Houston apartment developer who gained national attention for his excesses before he fell hard in the 1980's, is back.</p>
        <p>Mr. Farb, 77, has spent the last 15 years selling office buildings and trimming his apartment portfolio by 90 percent, in order to pay off $455 million in debts from real estate deals that went bad when the price of oil hit the skids and took the Texas economy with it. He has also put behind him such costly indulgences as a supper club, where he headlined as a lounge singer, and a glossy magazine catering to Texas's rich and self-absorbed.</p>
        <p>Now, Mr. Farb is putting the finishing touches on a $25 million, 372-unit apartment complex in the suburban Kingwood section of Houston -- his first project in a decade and a half. This time around, Mr. Farb said, he will keep his business on a firmer foundation.</p>
        <p>Like many developers who lost their French-cuffed shirts when the Texas real estate market crashed in 1983, Mr. Farb has become more cautious. Gone are the days when  he built 1,000-unit apartment buildings and office towers as if he were playing with Legos.</p>
        <p>''I've learned I'm not invincible,'' said Mr. Farb, who before the real estate collapse made the Forbes 400 list of the wealthiest people in America, with an estimated net worth of more than $200 million. Yet, he added, ''I'm not running scared, either.''</p>
        <p>A cinema buff who has financed five albums of himself singing show tunes, Mr. Farb has named his latest venture the Paramount, in honor of the studio that made many of the films he enjoyed watching as a boy in his father's two Houston movie theaters.</p>
        <p>THE new apartment complex was built using the same builders, landscapers, finance officers, accountants and lawyers whom Mr. Farb used in his heyday. But now, he said, they are contract workers, not employees. Mr. Farb was also more selective about the location.</p>
        <p>''Kingwood is zoned,'' he said, ''so I know there isn't going to be a lot of junk going up around the property, like pawn shops and liquor stores,'' which would diminish its value.</p>
        <p>Mike Inselmann, president of the American Metro/Study Corporation, a Houston company that compiles and analyzes housing data, said Mr. Farb is emblematic of most developers in the state.</p>
        <p>''It took the Texas market getting sucked down the drain before we started seeing a more studied and restrained approach to building,'' Mr. Inselmann said.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, at the slightest hint that the Houston market was going soft, new building permits started to tumble. They are projected to fall to 4,000 this year from 20,000 in 1998, Mr. Inselmann said. And the decline has come despite surging oil prices that have buoyed the local economy, and forecasts that 60,000 jobs, mostly unrelated to energy, would be created this year.</p>
        <p>''Everyone would prefer to be safe than sorry,'' he said, adding that Mr. Farb's new development could cash in on local builders' overreaction.</p>
        <p>Mr. Farb said he couldn't be happier about his timing or about his return to the apartment business. He is looking to develop more residential properties in Houston as well as in Atlanta. ''Apartments are what I know,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He is staying away from office buildings and ventures like the supper club and magazine that Mr. Farb said got him into ''trouble with a capital T.'' (He is not as shy about marriage, despite his highly publicized divorce in 1983 from his second wife, the socialite Carolyn Farb, which cost him a reported $20 million, though he disputes that figure. He has married four times since then, including three separate ceremonies with his current wife, Diane Lokey.)</p>
        <p>Outsiders agree that in focusing on apartments, he is playing to his strength. After all, Harold Farb apartments were once the hip places to live in Houston.</p>
        <p>''If you were young and single and upwardly mobile in the 1970's, you lived in a Farb,'' said Liz Dantone, a project manager for the Friendswood Development Company, a former Exxon subsidiary that has built several residential communities around Houston. ''He's still a master at branding.''</p>
        <p>Unlike apartments owned by anonymous real estate investment trusts, Mr. Farb's have always been identified with their owner, with his name and logo (showing him holding a rolled-up blueprint) plastered all over the place. Comment cards addressed ''Dear Mr. Farb'' are in every manager's office.</p>
        <p>''Landlords have such a negative image,'' Mr. Farb said. ''I've always let my tenants know who I am and how they can get in touch with me.''</p>
        <p>Often, Mr. Farb personally answers complaints written on those cards. He also visits his four remaining properties daily, making inspections, talking with maintenance men and striking up conversations with tenants.</p>
        <p>''I've gone back to my roots of providing people with a nice place to live at an affordable price,'' Mr. Farb said. Even while charging cut rates -- his credo is ''rent $10 below market'' -- he pays extra for amenities like resort-quality pool furniture and high-end exercise equipment. ''I want it to be a poor man's country club,'' he said.</p>
        <p>THE pool at the Paramount will be graced with a 7-foot-high statue of Minerva, the Roman goddess of wisdom, that he salvaged from his defunct marble-and-mirrored supper club, the Carlyle.</p>
        <p>''I paid $50,000 for that statue and now I have a place to put it,'' he said, pleased with his thrift. ''My daddy told me to always eat hot dogs, even if you can afford steak,'' Mr. Farb said. That way, a reversal of fortune will not seem as severe.</p>
        <p>''I still eat hot dogs,'' he said.</p>
