        <p>After a long friendship so close that they once managed each other's campaigns, Assemblyman Darryl C. Towns and Councilman Martin Malave Dilan have in recent years developed a relationship characterized more by the intensity of their political battles.</p>
        <p>This year, the Democratic primary in the 54th Assembly District in northeastern Brooklyn has brought simmering resentment and mutual recrimination to a full boil, as Mr. Towns is once again being opposed by his onetime friend.</p>
        <p>It was two years ago, shortly before the primary that year, when their friendship turned sour. For months, Mr. Dilan had been planning to run for Congress, but he changed his mind and decided instead to challenge Mr. Towns for the Assembly seat. Mr. Towns, who was first elected in 1992, prevailed handily.</p>
        <p>Mr. Towns has charged that his old confidant was motivated by a term limit law that would result in his being ineligible to run for re-election to the City Council, a charge he is repeating this year. With few realistic options in elective office, Mr. Towns argued, Mr. Dilan decided to forsake old ties for political survival.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dilan, in turn, maintains that the issue is neither term limits nor the friendship he once shared with the man he now dismisses as an ineffective legislator who connects poorly with the people of the district.</p>
        <p>While many Brooklyn Democrats cite Mr. Towns's commanding victory over Mr. Dilan two years ago, they also point out that Mr. Dilan has devoted much of his time and energy in the last two years to the rematch with the assemblyman in the Sept. 12 primary. And the councilman is waging a vigorous challenge.</p>
        <p>''Last time, we started out running for Congress and switched midstream,'' said Mr. Dilan, who has been in the City Council since 1991.  ''This time, I am completely focused on this race for the Assembly, and I'm reaching out to voters.''</p>
        <p>They both emphasize their histories in public office; they have secured hundreds of thousands of dollars each year for programs in their respective districts. They have few, if any, disagreements on various issues, from the need to increase state spending on the city's public schools to the need to improve facilities for residents in the city's public housing.</p>
        <p>What they do disagree on is their fitness to serve in the Assembly. Mr. Dilan depicts the assemblyman as a weary official who has offered little in the way of legislation. He charges that Mr. Towns is merely using the Assembly seat as a springboard to run for Congress should his father, United States Representative Edolphus Towns, step down one day.</p>
        <p>On his own role as a member of the City Council, Mr. Dilan, 49, said that he was responsible for ensuring that  computers were placed in every school in his district. ''We have senior centers that have been rebuilt and a new youth center because of my work in the Council. And I've fought to make sure that the infrastructure of New York City Housing Authority buildings are maintained.''</p>
        <p>Adding to the unpredictability is the uncertainty of voter turnout. The 54th District has one of the lowest levels of voter participation in the city, and each side is concentrating its efforts on getting those voters to the polls whom it considers to be its core supporters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Towns, 39, defended his work in the Assembly, evaluating himself as ''an effective voice in the community.'' When asked to discuss his accomplishments in office, he said: ''I have been making sure that resources have come to the community. If you talk to any of my colleagues or any community leaders, they will tell you that I've done an excellent job.''</p>
        <p>About his succeeding his father in Congress, Mr. Towns said: ''I'm not even going to respond to that. I'm focused on being the assemblyman.''</p>
        <p>Ethnicity has always been in the forefront of the politics in this piece of Brooklyn. The 54th District was created as a majority Hispanic district. But Mr. Towns, who is black, has won decisively since he was elected. In the 1990 census, the district was about 65 percent Hispanic and about 25 percent black. Non-Hispanic white residents make up about 5 percent of the district, and Asian-Americans about 4 percent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dilan, who is Puerto Rican, has charged that Mr. Towns has sought to divide the Hispanic vote by surreptitiously encouraging a Hispanic candidate, William Cruz, to enter the primary. And Mr. Towns's campaign finance disclosures indicate that he made a $500 contribution to Mr. Cruz, with the notation: ''Donation to prevent eviction.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Towns said the contribution was intended merely ''to help a constituent who had some trouble.'' Furthermore, Mr. Towns added, when he discovered that Mr. Cruz was a rival in the primary, he asked for the $500 to be returned. The campaign disclosure forms indicate that the money was returned within two weeks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Towns made a similar accusation against Mr. Dilan, suggesting that the councilman paid the legal bills of a black candidate who filed to run in the primary but was ultimately knocked off the ballot because he did not make an appearance at a court hearing at which Mr. Towns challenged his petition signatures. Mr. Dilan has denied any involvement in that candidate's campaign.</p>
        <p>In the election two years ago, Mr. Towns's campaign manager was his father. This year, the elder Mr. Towns is immersed in his own hotly contested re-election battle for Congress.</p>
        <p>And although Mr. Towns decisively won his Assembly race two years ago, he insists that he is taking nothing for granted this time.</p>
        <p>''You still have two former friends running for the same office,'' Mr. Towns said. ''But for two years, he's been preparing to challenge me and working hard at it. So, to me, it's a totally different election than last time.''</p>
