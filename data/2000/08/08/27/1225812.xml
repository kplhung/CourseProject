        <p>For Pramoedya Ananta Toer, forgiveness is cowardice. Principle is absolute. The only way to deal with the crimes of the past is to look them in the face, seize the culprits and punish them.</p>
        <p>''I've experienced it all,'' Mr. Pramoedya, the nation's most prominent writer and one of its moral touchstones, said in an interview the other day. ''I've been beaten, hit, tortured, humiliated. There cannot be forgiveness. I cannot reconcile with bandits.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pramoedya spent 11 years as a political prisoner during the harsh rule of President Suharto, which ended more than two years ago. Mr. Pramoedya's books were banned and his archives and library destroyed. Now, he said, the time for an accounting has come. ''I hold to the principle that all criminals of every kind must be put on trial,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But now that Mr. Suharto is gone and speech is free, society is filled with a clamor of voices, and Mr. Pramoedya's is just one of them. While his anger has added fuel to a national debate over the abuses perpetrated during Indonesia's three decades of authoritarian rule, the question his critics raise is just how much strength and energy does this unsteady nation have to reopen old wounds and reignite old enmities?</p>
        <p>As Indonesia struggles to rebuild itself, the debate over the role of the past has been overshadowed by the urgent issues of the moment -- the continuing political power of Mr. Suharto's army, the rise of separatist movements, the rebuilding of political institutions, the crisis of the economy, the threat of social unrest.</p>
        <p>These are issues, his critics say, that Mr. Pramoedya is not taking into account.</p>
        <p>Unlike South Africa when apartheid ended, Indonesia made no clean break with its past. There was no winning side in its struggle with history. Many of the abusers from the past are still powerful and many of the abuses continue today.</p>
        <p>''Yes, some penalties will have to be imposed, but how far these penalties go and who will suffer them is an issue we still have to debate,'' said Smita Notosusanto, a leading democratic advocate. ''That's the difficult part. If we go along totally with Pramoedya, we will have to sacrifice too much of our future in order to settle the past.''</p>
        <p>A number of judicial investigations have been opened, notably involving military abuses in East Timor last year and against a separatist movement in Aceh. But they are moving slowly, hampered by politics and the continuing power of the chief culprit, Indonesia's army.</p>
        <p>Last week, Parliament passed a constitutional amendment enshrining the principles of human rights but absolving any past abusers from prosecution. That protection, quietly inserted at the apparent insistence of the military, has drawn loud public criticism. It remains unclear how much effect it will have on any prosecutions under criminal law.</p>
        <p>At the same time, historians and researchers have begun learning the truth about past abuses, largely hidden in Mr. Suharto's time. These began with the massacres of hundreds of thousands of suspected Communists in the mid-1960's, at the time Mr. Suharto came to power. The abuses continued as he used the military to suppress opponents and maintain order throughout this broad and constantly feuding nation.</p>
        <p>With historical research only beginning, a number of government and private groups are exploring models like the truth commissions in South Africa and the trials in South Korea where two former presidents were convicted of abuses and then pardoned.</p>
        <p>But the challenge is more complicated in Indonesia, said Jonathan Simon, an American scholar who is helping develop democratic institutions here.</p>
        <p>''You have to be in a very strong and secure political position before you begin doing this kind of thing,'' he said. ''In South Africa you had a liberation movement that overthrew a previous regime and started fresh from a new point. What you have here in Indonesia is a mixture of the old and new governments, a mixture of reform and nonreform forces. It is not us and them the way it was in South Africa.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''My sense is that they are having enormous difficulty in confronting the past, partly for cultural reasons. It is not necessarily in the nature of Indonesian society and culture to dig up past aspects that have been shameful and blameful and negative and horrible in a lot of ways.''</p>
        <p>Hermawan Sulistyo, director of the Research Institute for Democracy and Peace, a private policy group, has been researching the massacres of 1965 and 1966 and sees a danger in confronting people with past traumas.</p>
        <p>He said that in Bali, which was devastated during those massacres, a private group has begun exploring local killings and confronting people with their own history. This action has served only to open fresh wounds and revive past traumas, without bringing any resolution, he said.</p>
        <p>''When you open things up, what you get is only political revenge and political vendetta behind what seems like a legal process,'' he said. ''The problem in Indonesia now is that many of the incidents, many of the abuses, are opened up with more political baggage than legal baggage.''</p>
        <p>On the other hand, he said, Indonesia is not yet ready for reconciliation. ''How can you reconcile with abusers when you still have the old machinery in power?''</p>
        <p>As historians and researchers work to learn the truth about the abuses that were hidden in Mr. Suharto's time, Mr. Pramoedya's principal critic in the debate is Goenawan Mohamad, a writer who is one of Indonesia's leading journalists.</p>
        <p>''Pramoedya looks at forgiving as eliminating the crime or the guilt,'' he said. ''To me, forgiving is acknowledgment of the guilt, and acknowledgment is important if you want to be humble to deal with the future.''</p>
        <p>Like Mr. Pramoedya, he said the most important thing now is to open a window into the past and to learn from it, but he said compromises must be made for the sake of national stability.</p>
        <p>''There needs to be a public discussion, a debate, a consciousness-raising session to acknowledge that Indonesians are capable of committing such atrocities,'' Mr. Goenawan said. ''And from that basis we can hope to avoid this kind of thing the next time around.''</p>
        <p>The first step, he said, is to allow the victims of past abuses to step forward and be heard.</p>
        <p>''It is time for the country to listen to the victims,'' he said. ''But maybe it cannot be the time for us to deal in a rigorous way with justice. It will have to be very selective justice, and, of course, selective justice is not exactly justice.''</p>
