        <p>For two years, Mark Cote, a 29-year-old man from Waterbury, Conn., had been seething at a city firefighter who he believed had broken up his marriage. The man taunted Mr. Cote continually, said Mr. Cote's mother, Rachel Cote.</p>
        <p>Yesterday morning, Mrs. Cote said, her son snapped.</p>
        <p>With a semiautomatic pistol, he fatally shot a neighbor, the firefighter and an ex-girlfriend's mother before turning the gun on himself, the police said.</p>
        <p>The killings took place in less than 20 minutes on a sunny Saturday morning in Waterbury, a city of 105,000 85 miles from New York.</p>
