        <p>Aretha Franklin was the first woman elected to the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame and the youngest recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors. These two honors came on top of all the Grammies and Lifetime Achievement Awards she has received, and each award has helped secure a place in music history for the powerful soul singer.</p>
        <p>From the early success of ''Respect'' and ''Freeway of Love,'' Ms. Franklin has defined gospel-based soul music for more than three decades.</p>
        <p>Her latest album, ''A Rose Is Still a Rose'' on Arista records, combines her sultry and powerful voice and classic style with the talents of some of today's newest and brightest artists, including Puffy Combs and Lauryn Hill.</p>
        <p>The title cut from the new album is a hip-hop-tinged tune that contrasts with the other songs on the album, such as the love ballad ''How Many Times'' and the mid tempo romping song of assertive womanhood, ''In Case You Forgot.''</p>
        <p>Famous for her scatting ability and emotion-ladened lyrics, Ms. Franklin long ago won the title of Queen of Soul with her sincere sweet soul and jazz style. She has said her signature tune, ''Respect,'' defines what is necessary to make any type of human relationship work. Other songs that will always be connected with her name include ''Ain't Nothin' Like the Real Thing'' and ''(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Franklin will appear at the Circus Maximus Theater at Caesars Atlantic City on Sept. 1, 2 and 3. (800) 736-1420.</p>
