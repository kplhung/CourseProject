        <p>AT 7 p.m. on Thursday, Joan Jett stood outside the 31st Street V.I.P. entrance to Madison Square Garden, looking fierce and impatient. ''Let's go!'' she said, clapping, glancing at her longtime manager and musical collaborator, Kenny Laguna. ''The girls are already warming up!''</p>
        <p>Ms. Jett, the goddess of tight-leathered 80's rock, is such a devoted fan of the W.N.B.A.'s New York Liberty, that it pains her to miss even a second of the team's preliminary shoot-around. What Jack Nicholson is to the Los Angeles Lakers, Ms. Jett is to the Liberty, a superfan and courtside fixture whose spirited cheering seems to bring the home team luck. Ms. Jett's seat in the Garden for every Liberty game is the same one occupied by Woody Allen at Knicks games. While Mr. Allen always seems to be skulking moodily beneath a floppy fishing cap, Ms. Jett is as loud and demonstrative as she is on stage at one of her rock shows.</p>

        <p>AT 7 p.m. on Thursday, Joan Jett stood outside the 31st Street V.I.P. entrance to Madison Square Garden, looking fierce and impatient. ''Let's go!'' she said, clapping, glancing at her longtime manager and musical collaborator, Kenny Laguna. ''The girls are already warming up!''</p>
        <p>Ms. Jett, the goddess of tight-leathered 80's rock, is such a devoted fan of the W.N.B.A.'s New York Liberty, that it pains her to miss even a second of the team's preliminary shoot-around. What Jack Nicholson is to the Los Angeles Lakers, Ms. Jett is to the Liberty, a superfan and courtside fixture whose spirited cheering seems to bring the home team luck. Ms. Jett's seat in the Garden for every Liberty game is the same one occupied by Woody Allen at Knicks games. While Mr. Allen always seems to be skulking moodily beneath a floppy fishing cap, Ms. Jett is as loud and demonstrative as she is on stage at one of her rock shows.</p>
        <p>Thursday night's Game 1 was crucial in the best-of-three playoff against the Liberty's nemesis, the Houston Comets, the reigning W.N.B.A. champs. And if the streets of Manhattan lacked the general frenzy of a springtime Knicks playoff run, you wouldn't know it once you stepped inside the Garden. These hoops stars may wear ponytails with color-coordinated scrunchies, but for celebrities like Ms. Jett, the Liberty has become the hottest sports ticket in town. The talk show host Rosie O'Donnell, the actress Rosie Perez and the rapper Queen Latifah are devotees of Liberty home games. Men turn out, too: actors like Gregory Hines, Michael Imperioli and the Baldwin brothers are frequently spotted in courtside seats. Still, no one has come to embody the bulldog devotion to the Liberty like Ms. Jett, rock's proto-riot grrrl.</p>
        <p>Not that she arrived, as Spike Lee often does at Knicks games, decked out in every piece of officially sanctioned team regalia. Ms. Jett looked very East Village, all tattoos and silver tribal jewelry. She wore tight black leather jeans, of course, and a tank top that said Dare Devil Tattoos. And though it was a steamy August evening, the lithe, petite former brunette (her head has been shaved for several months) sported a tiny black wool hat that was somewhere between a longshoreman's cap and a yeshiva boy's skullcap. Upon entering the Garden lobby, she was greeted by a chorus of schoolgirls shouting ''Hey, Joan!'' and ''We love your new song!''</p>
        <p>On the escalator, Ms. Jett turned back to the crowd and offered a word of advice: ''Be loud tonight! Everybody, be loud!'' Then she and Mr. Laguna took their courtside seats, immediately behind the official scorekeeper and announcer, and Ms. Jett began to shout encouragement to Liberty players as they ran onto the Garden floor. ''We got the home court advantage, guys, don't forget it!'' she said. She was high-fiving the players as they passed, but when she got to Teresa Weatherspoon the Liberty's playmaker, Ms. Jett accidentally committed a foul. ''I just whacked Spoon in the face,'' Ms. Jett said, sheepishly.</p>
        <p>Just before the opening tipoff, she was nibbling French fries and sipping bottled water as ''Unfinished Business,'' the Liberty fight song Ms. Jett wrote in the vein of her ''I Love Rock and Roll,'' began blaring.</p>
        <p>Rebecca Lobo, a Liberty star who is missing the playoffs because of an injury, came by in her cornrows and a smart brown pantsuit -- ''Your song's fantastic,'' she said, touching Ms. Jett lightly on the hip. Ms. Jett said: ''The fact that the Liberty could lose stars like Rebecca and still make the playoffs is really amazing. Shows you what kind of character this team's got.''</p>
        <p>But the game did not begin auspiciously for the hometown heroes. Houston opened up an early lead, while the Liberty kept missing easy chances. Ms. Jett led a raucous chant of ''L-I-B-E-R-T-Y!'' Then she turned to berate her companion. ''You should have your butt up yelling,'' she told Mr. Laguna, who with his graying blond hair and glasses, black T-shirt and chunky gold chain, looked like a cross between an aging 60's rocker and an extra on ''The Sopranos.''</p>
        <p>''I would but I don't know how to spell,'' Mr. Laguna said, shrugging. As the Liberty sank further behind in the score, Ms. Jett began a ferocious shout of ''Dee-fence!'' trying to psyche out the Houston ballhandlers. When a Comets guard threw a boneheaded pass to no one (it landed in the lap of the retired Liberty power forward Kim Hampton), Ms. Jett gave a triumphant thumbs up. ''Exactly what it's supposed to do,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Laguna explained, ''She totally believes her chants affect the opposition -- like a hex.''</p>
        <p>Halftime brought no beer break for Ms. Jett. A W.N.B.A. official slipped her a computer printout of the first-half statistics, which she studied intently like a homework assignment. Then she scanned the Garden, which was packed with 19,500 fans, spotting many N.B.A. stars: Stephon Marbury of the Nets and Marcus Camby, the Knicks forward, cradling a baby boy sucking a pacifier.</p>
        <p>For the Liberty, the second half began just as bleakly as the first. But Ms. Jett kept trying to find something to root for. A third foul was announced on Houston's Tiffani Johnson. Ms. Jett went ballistic, jumping up and screaming at the official: ''That's her fourth! That's her fourth!''</p>
        <p>The scorekeeper realized his error; and the announcer, turning to smile at Ms. Jett, acknowledged: ''Tiffani Johnson -- that's her fourth.''</p>
        <p>''They get it wrong sometimes,'' Ms. Jett said, proudly.</p>
        <p>On cue, Ms. Jett's ''Unfinished Business'' fired up again, the video projected overhead. Suddenly, the Liberty had new momentum; players began making steals and converting layups; they closed to within two points. Ms. Jett's fists clenched as she bounded up and down.</p>
        <p>Still, in the end, the Houston squad proved too disciplined, and Cynthia Cooper, the Comets standout guard, drove a dagger through the Liberty's heart with a final basket and free throw. The buzzer sounded. Houston, 59; New York, 52.</p>
        <p>''It's going to be tough, but not impossible,'' Ms. Jett said, contemplating the odds of the New York team winning two consecutive games on the road. She and Mr. Laguna were leaving the next morning for Houston, and Ms. Jett said she would be just as vocal, on the Comets' home court. ''I'm gonna be just like this, except it's in Houston,'' she said.  ''Let's see if those Texas fans don't try to kill me.''</p>
        <p>Leaving the court through a tunnel used by the players, a W.N.B.A. official put his palm up to Ms. Jett's and said, ''Hey, Joan, bring home two wins, O.K.?''</p>
        <p>''I'll try,'' she said, forcing a smile.</p>
