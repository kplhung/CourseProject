        <p>Ten years after Syrian forces snuffed out Lebanon's civil war, this battered country is entering a crucial parliamentary election marked by a deepening economic crisis, widespread public cynicism and startlingly open denunciations of vote rigging and Syrian domination.</p>
        <p>Rafik Hariri, the swashbuckling multibillionaire builder who had raised hopes that the glittering Beirut of old could be reborn, is running hard in a free-spending campaign to become prime minister again.</p>
        <p>But in the last few days the government of President Emile Lahoud has declared an all-out war on Mr. Hariri, with hours of special programming on state-run television accusing him of everything from corruption in mosque building to agreeing to resettle Palestinian refugees -- a particular sore point here -- to being fat. One television spot showed two hapless fisherman floating near a raft bearing Mr. Hariri's ubiquitous campaign poster and shouting, ''Look -- a whale.''</p>
        <p>From 1992 to 1998, Mr. Hariri, backed by Syria, tried to rebuild Beirut almost single-handedly, throwing up highways, an airport, a showy sports stadium and a breathtaking restoration of the downtown -- a shelled-out no man's land in the war -- with banks and cafes springing up among old churches, mosques, Roman ruins, and Ottoman, French colonial and Levantine stone buildings.</p>
        <p>A greengrocer's son who went to Saudi Arabia and became a builder for, and friends with, the royal family, Mr. Hariri was not of the world of the traditional feudal clan leaders of Lebanon's divided sectarian society. He seemed a modern international mogul out of James Bond, with his  own airliner, television station, newspaper and palace, and a bulletproof limousine with a device that cancels nearby cell phones to foil remote-control bombs.</p>
        <p>There were hopes that the Beirut of the 50's and 60's -- the banking and intellectual center of the Middle East, the playground for oil-rich Saudi and Persian Gulf Arabs -- would make a comeback. Gleaming luxury hotels and apartment towers went up in a frenzy of speculation, along with branches of Parisian fashion houses.</p>
        <p>But Lebanon is seeing its dreams of postwar revival slip away.</p>
        <p>The recent political developments that have altered the region -- Israel's withdrawal from the south, the death of Syria's longtime ruler, Hafez al-Assad, and the tentative progress of the Israeli-Palestinian peace effort -- have yet to translate into a revival for Lebanon. Nor have they allowed it to slip out from under Syria's yoke.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the Middle Eastern country with the most potential -- a varied natural beauty of mountain and seashore, an educated, resourceful and industrious population, and a rich history and culture -- Lebanon is an economic wreck. The government has a current deficit of more than $22 billion -- 140 percent of gross national product -- and it is growing. Debt service regularly runs over 90 percent of revenues and last month topped 100 percent.</p>
        <p>There is a vast income discrepancy between the few gaudy rich and the many poor, still living in makeshift slums, displaced by years of war. The middle class is battered -- and departing.</p>
        <p>There was a burst of national pride in May when Israel withdrew from the border zone it had occupied for more than 20 years. But that is only bringing new problems of rebuilding a devastated area. The government is widely distrusted as inept and corrupt, and the elections are a reminder of just who is really in charge.</p>
        <p>Leading Lebanese political figures regularly go -- or are summoned -- to the Syrian capital, Damascus, for instructions, but much of the day-to-day running of Lebanon falls under the direction of Maj. Gen. Ghazi Kanaan, a Syrian military intelligence chief. In this he is helped by Brig. Gen. Jamil Sayed, a Shiite Muslim with wide power as head of the Lebanese internal security agency.</p>
        <p>Roughly 35,000 Syrian troops are in Lebanon, along with an unknown number of intelligence operatives.  But by now Syria has so thoroughly placed its loyalists in the Lebanese system that the Syrian military presence is not widely visible.</p>
        <p>General Kanaan and General Sayed, the leading Lebanese newspaper An-Nahar reported in June, are in charge of organizing the election and selecting candidates who would be ultimately successful on the basis of their support for Syria.</p>
        <p>''Screening the candidates to the general elections is also aimed at securing a Parliament that would be supportive of President Emile Lahoud and that will help him rule smoothly,'' the newspaper reported. ''The way the list of candidates is being set up gives a prior outlook to the structure of the new Parliament, which is expected to be pro-Syrian in its majority.''</p>
        <p>Critics say Mr. Hariri's ambitious projects ran up the enormous national debt and were riddled with corruption. He is detested by two of Syria's main delegates here: President Lahoud, the former military chief, and the powerful interior minister, Michel Murr, who owns a burned-out downtown skyscraper that did not profit from Mr. Hariri's restoration.</p>
        <p>The real estate boom collapsed in 1997, leaving the country with an estimated 370,000 empty, mostly expensive, apartments. Hundreds of thousands of Lebanese, most of them young and educated, have left the country in the last decade. In a place that flaunts its devotion to appearance and ostentation, two telltale segments are hurting: hairdressers and expensive restaurants.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hariri left office when Mr. Lahoud became Syria's choice as president in 1998. Now the free-spending tycoon is fielding a ticket of 18 candidates for the 19 seats from Beirut and has formed alliances with what are believed to be leading tickets in the Chouf mountains, the north and the Bekaa region that could give him a majority when the 128-member Parliament convenes in October.</p>
        <p>But his future is more likely to depend on Syria than the voters. Presumably with this in mind, he traveled to Damascus soon after 32-year-old Bashar al-Assad took office after the death in June of his father. He went as part of a consortium of four major Saudi investors ready to put as much as $400 million into real estate development, luxury hotels and other projects there.</p>
        <p>Syria is now believed to be leaning toward Mr. Hariri as Lebanon's only hope of avoiding fiscal collapse, but President Lahoud's vociferous objections are proving awkward. By week's end, the Syrian president was summoning the parliamentary speaker, Nabih Berri, the army commander, Gen. Michel Suleiman, Mr. Hariri and Prime Minister Salim Hoss to Damascus.</p>
        <p>The election law is complex and itself controversial. There are 17 recognized religions and sects here, and the seats are apportioned to make Parliament half-Christian and half-Muslim. One Beirut district is to be represented by one Maronite, one Roman Catholic, one Greek Orthodox, one Protestant and two Sunnis.</p>
        <p>Leading candidates like Mr. Hariri assemble slates of supporters fitting these categories. People do not vote where they live, but in their family's home village. Voting in the northern districts is to be Sunday and in Beirut and southern areas next Sunday.</p>
        <p>Scorn is being heaped on the elections from all quarters. On the left, Walid Jumblatt, the hereditary Druse leader, speaks darkly of ''the excessive intervention of the regime.'' On the right, Dory Chamoun, survivor of a once-powerful Christian family, called for a boycott of the vote, saying, ''Lebanon is now a crippled state whose affairs are conducted by Damascus.''</p>
        <p>For many Lebanese it is a depressing spectacle.</p>
        <p>''It's not worth voting,'' said Caline Chidiac, 26, an optometrist. ''I don't feel represented, I feel disgusted. We are the middle class that's not going to exist. They're pushing all the good ones and the young ones to go somewhere else.''</p>
        <p>''This could be an amazing country, but there's no democracy here,'' she said, adding in reference to the campaign portraits of candidates plastered all over the city: ''We just see these pictures. It's a nightmare. It's just faces, faces, faces.''</p>
