        <p>As Israel and the Palestinians circle each other in a wary and increasingly fractious quest for a final peace agreement, the spotlight only rarely settles these days on a small, wizened, straggly bearded man in a wheelchair whose antagonism to Israel could one day unsettle or even destroy any deal that establishes a Palestinian state pledged to coexistence with Israel.</p>
        <p>At first glance, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, spiritual leader of the Islamic Resistance Movement, or Hamas, seems an improbable enemy for a peace that would aim at resolving one of the world's most protracted and bitter conflicts. Until he speaks, sketching a future of unremitting warfare until Israel is wiped from the map, there is little about him to suggest that he leads an organization that the United States lists as one of the world's most dangerous, if currently quiescent, terror groups.</p>
        <p>At 64, Sheik Yassin -- the title is one given in Islam to a man revered for his piety -- is emaciated by the paralysis he suffered in a teenage accident on a Gaza beach. His hearing is deeply impaired by infections he blames on the 10 years he spent in Israeli prisons before his release in October 1997. He dresses in the all-white of an Islamic holy man, and speaks in such a tiny voice that even aides have to lean close to understand what he is saying.</p>
        <p>But what he says, and his ability to turn words into action, could hardly be more important to the long-term prospects for Middle East peace. Even if Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, overcome deep differences over Jerusalem and other issues that confounded attempts to reach a peace pact at last month's Camp David summit meeting, Sheik Yassin and the Islamic resistance could remain the wild card of regional politics, their unreconciled hatred for Israel a threat to destabilize peace. The words have hardly changed, not since Sheik Yassin, responding to the new mood of defiance represented by the street uprising among Palestinians known as the intifada, emerged from decades of Islamic devotions to found Hamas in 1987. ''I believe completely that Israel will vanish, and that we Palestinians will recover the lands and homes that were stolen from us in 1948,'' he said. Extrapolating from predictions of disaster for the Jews he says he has drawn from inferences in the Koran, he added: ''I've said it before, I'll say it again, the year 2027 will see the end of the state of Israel.''</p>
        <p>But whether this is the vow of a zealot whose time has passed, of an embittered man who lost his family's lands in a village, Al-Jura, that was on the Mediterranean coast near what is now the Israeli town of Ashkelon in 1948, or the resolve of a charismatic leader with a charter that will one day plunge the region into a renewed round of bombings and assassinations, may depend on how the eddying forces of Palestinian politics resolve.</p>
        <p>As part of the 1993 Oslo accords that began the peace effort, Mr. Arafat pledged to help uproot Palestinian terrorism, but his record has been mixed. No outsider can really know whether Mr. Arafat and Sheik Yassin are irreconcilable adversaries, the good-cop-bad-cop act of Palestinian politics, or as Israeli intelligence officials believe, a complex and shifting amalgam of both.</p>
        <p>In an extended interview at his office on the Gaza beachfront, ended only by the muezzin's call to prayfrom a local mosque, the signals were conflicting.</p>
        <p>On one hand, Sheik Yassin complained vigorously that Mr. Arafat was holding about 300 activists from Hamas and an associated group, Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, in jail, in addition to 1,500 others who are prisoners of the Israelis. He also spoke of the 10 weeks he spent under house arrest in Gaza in 1998, under Mr. Arafat's orders, after an abortive Hamas attempt to blow up a school bus near the Jewish settlement of Kfar Darom in Gaza.</p>
        <p>Sheik Yassin said Mr. Arafat's intelligence apparatus had voided 175 separate attacks against Israeli targets that had been planned by Hamas's military wing, the Ezzadin al-Qassem Brigade, in recent years. This, he implied, explained why there had been few attacks in Israel and around the Jewish settlements in Gaza and the West Bank since the chaotic years from 1994 to 1996, when a spate of suicide bombings and kidnappings by Hamas and Islamic Jihad killed scores of Israelis. At that time, Mr. Arafat was just beginning to assert his authority in the first blocks of territory ceded to the Palestinians under the Oslo accords.</p>
        <p>Against this, there was much to suggest that Sheik Yassin and Mr. Arafat recognize that they need each other. Mr. Arafat's Palestinian Authority recently permitted Hamas to set up its Gaza headquarters only a few hundred yards down Gaza's beachfront road from Mr. Arafat's  ''presidential'' offices. And much about the new Hamas offices suggests that it has no need to pretend it lives in the shadows.</p>
        <p>The simple offices are sandwiched between the Dolphin bar and the Al-Jojo fishing tackle shop. The prayer room used by Sheik Yassin has an open portal looking out over the pounding Mediterranean surf, and there are no armed guards outside. When Sheik Yassin leaves, he travels in an expensive Range Rover, adapted to take the Islamic leader's wheelchair, which the sheik's aides said was given to him by Mr. Arafat.</p>
        <p>When Sheik Yassin was asked when he last met Mr. Arafat, he said he had invited him to dinner at his Gaza home three months ago. ''Of course, we talked politics,'' he said. ''Politics is our bread and water.''</p>
        <p>Personally, he said he considered Mr. Arafat brave, if misguided. ''He has tried to restore our rights, but if he can't, he should step aside and allow others to try,'' Sheik Yassin said. ''If he recognizes the state of Israel, he will have given away our rights to our 1948 lands, and he will have gone from leading our resistance to defending our enemy.''</p>
        <p>At this point, Sheik Yassin's words turned menacing, at least for Mr. Arafat, suggesting another reason why Mr. Arafat has chosen, until now, not to have any final showdown with Hamas. At the Camp David talks, the sheik said, Mr. Arafat appeared to have toed the ultimate ''red line'' in Palestinian politics -- finalizing a deal that, in return for mutual recognition by Israel and a Palestinian state, would have given Israel the prize sought since 1948, acceptance of its right to live on lands taken from Palestinians in Israel's independence war.</p>
        <p>''Arafat is in a very critical situation -- he can't move forward, and he can't move back,'' he said. ''He's reached the logical conclusion of his policy of negotiating with the Israelis, and he's reached a dead end, unless he makes concessions that would be fatal for him. I only hope, for his sake, that he can get himself out of this situation, without giving up any Palestinian rights, without sacrificing our future for the sake of the Zionist entity.''</p>
        <p>On a blindingly hot summer's day that had many of the 1.1 million Palestinians of Gaza sheltering in the shadows, there was much else to suggest that Hamas and its rejectionist politics are far from having exhausted their future, especially among the young. Conversations with several people produced only a minority -- many with links to Mr. Arafat's apparatus -- who said they would accept, as part of a final peace settlement with Israel, a renunciation of the ''1948 lands'' -- a phrase used in Gaza and the West Bank.</p>
        <p>A merchant selling gold trinkets from a hand cart in the bazaar, a well-known editor, a schoolteacher, an 18-year-old youth kicking a football along the beach, a cashier selling stationery, a food shop owner -- all dismissed the notion that Palestinians would settle permanently for a state in Gaza and the West Bank, and a foothold in Jerusalem, except as a way station to a fuller reckoning with Israel later.</p>
        <p>The strongest support for Hamas, now as before, comes from those living in refugee camps, perhaps as many as two-thirds of the Gaza population. These are people who live in Gaza City, Rafah and other towns, in squalid neighborhoods with unpaved roads, inadequate electricity, water and sanitation, and chronic unemployment that have condemned three generations in the same families to poverty. The camps are divided into neighborhoods, named for the towns and villages in pre-1948 Palestine.</p>
        <p>In Rafah, at the southern end of the Gaza Strip, when a visitor asked Ahmed Da'abes, age 16, where he was from, he answered without a pause, ''Yibna'' -- a predominantly Palestinian town before 1948, now the Israeli town of Yavne, 10 miles south of Tel Aviv. And what did Ahmed think of Mr. Arafat? ''Well, you know very well the kind of leaders we have now,'' he said. ''If our leaders were from the Islamic movement, we would be sure that we would one day have Yibna back.''</p>
        <p>The message is one that needs no underscoring in Israel. Organizations like Shin Bet, the internal security agency, have never relented in their hunt for Islamic militants, and have scored some chilling successes. In January 1996, a cell phone doctored by Shin Bet exploded in the hands of Yehiya Ayash, the leader of the al-Qassem brigade, killing him. His successor, Mohammed Dief, was arrested in Gaza in May this year, and is being held in an Israeli jail.</p>
        <p>This week, Shin Bet announced that a joint operation between its agents and Mr. Arafat's in Israel, Gaza and the West Bank had resulted in the roundup of 23 Islamic activists involved in planning terror bombings and other attacks, including one Gaza man, Nabil Okal, 27, said to have been sent by Hamas for training in a camp in Pakistan run by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born terrorist leader.</p>
        <p>Last month, another Shin Bet operation resulted in the seizure of an alleged Hamas armory in the West Bank town of Nablus, where agents were said to have found one of the largest stores of weapons and bomb-making equipment seized in years. The two swoops appeared to have been behind a new State Department advisory issued 10 days ago warning Americans of an increased risk of terrorist attacks in Israel, and might have prompted a similar warning given this week by Mr. Barak.</p>
        <p>Three years ago, Sheik Yassin said his organization would consider a ''truce'' with Israel if it abandoned all claims to Gaza, the West Bank and Jerusalem, and released all Palestinian prisoners. But in the interview in Gaza City, he said that the offer was now void, as Israel had rejected it. Asked whether this would not condemn young Palestinians to an endless, bloody fight against a nation that is heavily armed and trained, he smiled, as if he had heard such foolishness a thousand times.</p>
        <p>''I have the strength of a man who is ready to fight and die for the liberation of his land, who doesn't need aircraft and tanks and atomic bombs,'' he said. ''How can Israel resist people who are prepared to die as martyrs?''</p>
