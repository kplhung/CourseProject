        <p>The focus has been on the quarterbacks so far, but it may shift to the defenses today when Penn State plays Southern California in the 18th Kickoff Classic at Giants Stadium.</p>
        <p>Rashard Casey will start at quarterback for Penn State after leading the Nittany Lions to victory in the Alamo Bowl last season. Carson Palmer is the Trojans' quarterback.</p>
        <p>But Penn State has questions on defense, having lost the all-Americans LaVar Arrington and Courtney Brown to the N.F.L.</p>
        <p>U.S.C., meanwhile, has 10 defensive starters back, including linebackers Zeke Moreno and Markus Steele.</p>
        <p>Penn State was 10-3 last season. U.S.C. was 6-6, winning its final three games.</p>
