        <p>The Brandywine Valley never produced a Mark Twain to glamorize its serpentine river, or a Washington Irving to make its folkways legendary. Instead, the valley lays claim to artists -- painters like Howard Pyle and the Wyeth clan -- who found inspiration in its gentle beauty and the simplicity of Quaker farmsteads.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the area owes much of its identity to Quaker settlers. The Society of Friends so thoroughly put its imprint on the lower valley that its influence is behind nearly everything along the Brandywine in the 15 miles or so between Chester County, Pa., and Wilmington, Del.</p>
        <p>According to legend, the City of Wilmington began to flourish in 1735 after Elizabeth Shipley, a Pennsylvania Quaker, crossed Brandywine Creek on a visit, recognized the vista as a scene from one of her dreams and persuaded her wealthy husband to move there. Miles of undeveloped woodlands flank the Brandywine from Delaware north to Chadds Ford, Pa., serving as a barrier against suburban sprawl -- the legacy of William Poole Bancroft, a visionary Quaker textile mill owner who began preserving land after the Civil War.</p>
        <p>The du Ponts founded a gunpowder business, which later grew into the DuPont Company, in 1802 on the site of a former Quaker cotton mill. And the renowned 1,070-acre Longwood Gardens near Kennett Square, Pa., founded by Pierre S. du Pont, began as an arboretum planted by Quaker brothers in 1798.</p>
        <p>There's hardly a better time than fall to experience this historic countryside. As the humidity of summer disappears, these old communities come to life. The majestic tulip poplars along the banks of the creek turn a buttery yellow while the stones of barns and farmhouses take on the tone of oak leaves.</p>
        <p>Events</p>
        <p>The 966-acre naturalistic gardens at Winterthur, the decorative arts museum six miles north of Wilmington on Kennett Pike (Route 52), are the backdrop for the museum's annual craft festival next Saturday and Sunday beginning at 10 a.m. In addition to 200 juried artisans, there will be music, fireworks, crafts and museum tours. Admission $8 in advance, $10 at the gate, $2 for children 5 to 11; (800) 448-3883. The museum will also hold the Winterthur Garden Art Show Oct. 7 to 13. Original works on paper, presented by the Philadelphia Water Color Society, focus on the four seasons of the gardens.</p>
        <p>For 40 years in Wilmington a large arts festival has been held in riverside Brandywine Park. This year's Arts Festival, on North Park Drive, showcases the work of roughly 300 artists on Sept. 9 from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Sept. 10 from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission $4, under 18 and over 64 free; (302) 529-0761.</p>
        <p>The nation's mushroom industry got its start in Kennett Square in 1880 when the son of a Quaker carnation grower settled on a way to use of his father's greenhouses in the winter. This year's Mushroom Festival takes place Sept. 9 and 10 in Kennett Square, with cooking demonstrations, farm tours and growing exhibits. Hours are 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission free; (888) 440-9920.</p>
        <p>Hagley Museum, on Route 141 two miles north of Wilmington, is the site of the gunpowder mill and the first du Pont home -- Eleutherian Mills -- which was heavily damaged more than once by blasts. The exhibition ''Coming to America: The du Pont Family's Story,'' which runs through next summer, traces the family's first 100 years. Open daily 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Admission $4; ages 6 to 14, $2; children under 6, free. (302) 658-2400. The grounds alone, with the scenic remains of the old stone powder mill buildings along the Brandywine, are worth a visit.</p>
        <p>Pierre du Pont bought Peirce's Park arboretum in 1906 to save its trees. Eventually, he put all his energy into building Longwood, permanently endowing it in 1946. The gardens, off Route 1 three miles northeast of Kennett Square, will have changing fall displays through Nov. 19. The arboretum takes center stage in the Autumn Colors exhibit Oct. 2 to 20. The Chrysanthemum Festival, Oct. 21 to Nov. 19, features more than 20,000 chrysanthemums. Admission $12 ($8 on Tuesdays), $6 ages 16 to 20, $2 ages 6 to 15. Open daily 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.; (610) 388-1000.</p>
        <p>Sightseeing</p>
        <p>The Chester County Historical Society, 225 North High Street in West Chester, Pa., presents authentic interiors of 18th and 19th century homes that were dismantled and reconstructed by Quaker craftsmen for the museum. They include furniture and paintings. Open Monday to Saturday 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Admission $5, $4 ages 60 and older, $2.50 ages 6 to 17; (610) 692-4800.</p>
        <p>One way to see the Brandywine Valley is from the river, also called the Brandywine Creek. Wilderness Canoe Trips of Wilmington offers canoe, kayak and inner-tube trips down the Brandywine. Various packages have paddling times of two to four hours. Tubing is the least expensive at $10, while the four-hour canoe trip runs $47. Wilderness transports river riders from behind Fairfax Shopping Center off Route 202 in  Wilmington to the starting point,  then meets the paddlers downstream. Trips start from 8:30 a.m. to 1 p.m.; (302) 654-2227.</p>
        <p>Brandywine Battlefield Park, in 1777 the scene of one of the largest one-day land battles of the Revolutionary War, is now a rolling 52-acre park off Route 1 in Chadds Ford. Admission is free, with a $3.50 charge for tours of two farmhouses used by Washington and Lafayette and reconstructed to look as they did during the battle. Open Tuesday to Saturday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday noon to 5 p.m.; (610) 459-3342.</p>
        <p>Besides providing a lovely river walk, the Brandywine River Museum and Conservancy on Route 1 in Chadds Ford is home to one of the largest collections of works by the artists N. C., Andrew and Jamie Wyeth. Housed in a Civil War-era grist mill, it is showing ''The Fabric of Persuasion: 200 Years of Political Quilts'' through Nov. 19; buttons, bandannas and other political paraphernalia are included. Open daily 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Admission $5, $2.50 for ages 65 and older and 6 to 12, free under 6; (610) 388-2700.</p>
        <p>The 300-acre Nemours estate, at 1600 Rockland Road in Wilmington, a modified Louis XVI French chateau, was built by Alfred I. du Pont in 1909 and 1910. The 102-room mansion contains his collection of paintings, rugs, tapestries and other decorative arts. The gardens surrounding the house are considered among the finest examples of French-style gardens in the country. Guided tours Tuesday to Saturday through November, at 9 and 11 a.m. and 1 and 3 p.m.; Sunday, 11 a.m. and 1 and 3 p.m. Reservations recommended for individuals, required for groups. Admission $10; (302) 651-6912.</p>
        <p>A much smaller example of a formal garden, which can be viewed at no charge, is at Gibraltar, a former du Pont estate at Greenhill Avenue and Pennsylvania Avenue in Wilmington. The formal Italianate gardens, designed in the early 1900's, were restored and opened last year. Tuesday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.; (302) 651-9617.</p>
        <p>Where to Stay</p>
        <p>The 10-room Whitewing Farm Bed and Breakfast at 370 Valley Road, (610) 388-2664, fax (610) 388-3650, is adjacent to Longwood Gardens in Kennett Square. The 18th-century farmstead on 43 acres has lodging in the former stable, carriage house, gatehouse, saddle barn and pond cottage. Doubles run $125 to $169.</p>
        <p>The Mendenhall Hotel is tucked off Route 52 in Mendenhall, Pa., away from the highways that can obscure the valley's beauty. The 70-room hotel, three miles from Longwood Gardens, also has a restaurant, The Mendenhall Inn. Doubles are $125; (610) 388-2100, fax (610) 388-1184.</p>
        <p>Budget: The two-year-old Microtel, 500 Willowbrook Lane, West Chester, Pa., has 102 comfortable rooms and suites near tourist attractions. Doubles: $69 with breakfast; (888) 619-9292, fax (610) 738-9192.</p>
        <p>Luxury: The Inn at Montchanin Village, Route 100 and Kirk Road, five miles north of Wilmington, (302) 888-2133, fax (302) 888-0389, is in a converted 19th-century tenant village.

        <p>Where to Eat</p>
        <p>The year-old Restaurant 821, at 821 North Market Street, has brought  new sophistication to downtown Wilmington with Mediterranean dishes.

        <p>For romantic atmosphere and fine food, try the Dilworthtown Inn at 1390 Old Wilmington Pike in West Chester; (610) 399-1390. The 1758 tavern, illuminated by candles and gaslights, offers a wine list with more than 800 bottles. Main courses include Colorado rack of lamb with champagne garlic mustard crust. Dinner for two with a moderate wine costs about $120.</p>
        <p>In Trolley Square, a stylish residential area in Wilmington, is Tavola Toscana at 14th and DuPont Streets. The antipasto bar is piled high with Tuscan appetizers like grilled octopus, smoked mussels and fresh mozzarella. Hand-rolled pastas, served in a relaxed atmosphere, are a favorite. Dinner for two with wine costs about $65; (302) 654-8001.</p>
        <p>The Half Moon Restaurant and Saloon, 108 West State Street in Kennett Square, (610) 444-7232, has a menu not soon forgotten. The game medley entree, for example, often includes antelope, caribou, a game sausage and, most notably, wild boar with peppercorn sauce. The crab nacho dip ($8.50) is entree-sized. Dinner for two with wine, about $50.</p>
        <p>The Charcoal Pit at 2600 Concord Pike (Route 202) in Wilmington has been a favorite for decades. In the 1960's the place was a ''Happy Days''-style hangout. The menu includes charbroiled hamburgers, soups, shakes and sundaes. Dinner for two runs under $20; expect to wait for a table.</p>
        <p>Shopping</p>
        <p>This is antiques country, and many businesses in the Longwood Gardens area supply a map showing 24 antiques markets. Occasionally a real bargain can be found.</p>
        <p>The Brandywine River Antiques Market on Route 1 in Chadds Ford houses three floors of dealers in an 1857 barn. There are antique postcards for a few dollars and English china. A Staffordshire teapot is $325. The market has a large inventory of furniture; (610) 388-2000, fax (610) 388-2720. Open Wednesday to Sunday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.</p>

        <p>WHAT'S DOING IN MAUREEN MILFORD is writing a book about former Gov. Pierre S. du Pont of Delaware.</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 17, 2000, Sunday  The What's Doing column on Aug. 27, about the Brandywine Valley, referred imprecisely to the site of the Battle of Brandywine, in 1777. Washington had his headquarters in what is now Brandywine Battlefield Park, and troop movements indeed took place there. But the fighting itself went on in other sections of the 10-square-mile National Historic Landmark that includes the park.</p>
