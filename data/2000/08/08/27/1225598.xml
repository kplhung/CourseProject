        <p>Pushing Pants for Pets</p>
        <p>Q. Many years ago, news articles told of a New York society dedicated to clothing animals in the name of public decency. What became of the tongue-in-cheek crusade?</p>
        <p>A. On May 27, 1959, the ''Today'' show on NBC featured an interview with G. Clifford Prout Jr., president of an organization called the Society for Indecency to Naked Animals. Mr. Prout pleaded with viewers to join his national crusade to clothe all animals ''standing higher than four inches or who are longer than six inches,'' arguing that their nudity was debasing to man and beast alike. Membership applications were to be sent to 507 Fifth Avenue.</p>

        <p>Pushing Pants for Pets</p>
        <p>Q. Many years ago, news articles told of a New York society dedicated to clothing animals in the name of public decency. What became of the tongue-in-cheek crusade?</p>
        <p>A. On May 27, 1959, the ''Today'' show on NBC featured an interview with G. Clifford Prout Jr., president of an organization called the Society for Indecency to Naked Animals. Mr. Prout pleaded with viewers to join his national crusade to clothe all animals ''standing higher than four inches or who are longer than six inches,'' arguing that their nudity was debasing to man and beast alike. Membership applications were to be sent to 507 Fifth Avenue.</p>
        <p>The office address, which was a broom closet with a mail slot, near 68th Street, received bags of letters, equally divided among membership requests and indignant protests. Few, however, questioned the legitimacy or seriousness of the organization itself, even after Mr. Prout -- actually the actor Buck Henry -- appeared on the ''Today'' show a second time, singing an a cappella version of the group's marching song and displaying the society's shield, which was emblazoned with a medieval figure in a suit of armor.</p>
        <p>The hoax was perpetrated by Alan Abel, a New York advertising man and satirist, who kept the society alive by issuing news releases and orchestrating publicity stunts and public appearances. The ''social satire'' reached its apogee on Aug. 21, 1962, when Mr. Henry appeared as President Prout on Walter Cronkite's news program on CBS, accompanying himself on the ukulele. This time Mr. Henry was recognized and the hoax was exposed, though, as your letter indicates, the society was slow to die in the public imagination.</p>
        <p>Hell's Kitchen in the Raw</p>
        <p>Q. The demolition of tenements on the west side of Eighth Avenue between 47th and 48th Streets has revealed an old painted sign on the side of a building. It reads: ''Young &amp; Schmuck -- Fine Wines, Liquors &amp; Cigars -- Pool &amp; Billiard Parlor.'' Can you give any information about the pool hall, Young or Schmuck?</p>
        <p>A. Very little. The five-story building, at 772 Eighth Avenue, sits at the eastern edge of Hell's Kitchen, then a broad-shouldered factory and tenement district that by the late 19th century was one of the city's grittier slums. The Irish were the largest group, but there were also Scots, Germans and African-Americans.</p>
        <p>According to the architectural historian Christopher Gray, Fred Schmuck was the original owner of the building, which was built in 1873. The wide, handsome tenements now being demolished to the north were built in 1897; the ''Young &amp; Schmuck'' sign was no doubt painted during this 24-year period, when pool halls were becoming popular around the city. Mr. Gray added, however, that census records and city directories during these years do not show a Young or a Schmuck at the address, or associated with a billiard parlor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gray also said newspaper reports beginning in the 1890's record many police raids of liquor, gambling and prostitution dens in the area, but Young &amp; Schmuck's billiard parlor was not mentioned. Further research is called for.</p>
        <p>As recently as last year, 772 Eighth Avenue retained an astonishingly unaltered, turn-of-the-century wooden storefront, beneath layer upon layer of chipped and peeling paint.</p>
        <p>Getting Potholes Filled</p>
        <p>Q. As a bike rider, I encounter a number of dangerous potholes, some of which seem permanent. Isn't there a hot line for reporting them?</p>
        <p>A. Dial C-A-L-L-D-O-T, or (212) 225-5368, and follow the instructions; eventually a Department of Transportation operator will record the nature and location of the offending crater. The department says more than half are repaired within 30 days.</p>

        <p>Correction:  September 17, 2000, Sunday  A report in the F.Y.I. column on Aug. 27 about an old painted sign for ''Young &amp; Schmuck'' on the side of a tenement misstated the location. It is on the east side of Eighth Avenue between 47th and 48th Streets, not the west side.</p>
