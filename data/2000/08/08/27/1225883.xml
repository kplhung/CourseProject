        <p>A Baptist church in Morningside Heights was damaged yesterday in a suspicious fire, officials said.</p>
        <p>The fire at the church, the Greater Zion Hill Baptist Church at Manhattan Avenue and 116th Street, was reported at 6:40 p.m. and burned for half an hour, said Firefighter Robert Calise, a Fire Department spokesman. No one was injured.</p>
        <p>Officials suspect arson because the fire was already heavy when firefighters arrived only four minutes after the alarm was called in, Firefighter Calise said. ''That kind of volume and the extension of it indicated possible accelerant,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The church's pastor, the Rev. Frank Blackshear, said the three-story brick building suffered considerable smoke and water damage. He said he did not know of anyone who had a grudge against the church.</p>
        <p>He said the church might hold its 11 a.m. service today in Morningside Park, on the next block.</p>
