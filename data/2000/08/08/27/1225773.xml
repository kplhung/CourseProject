        <p>EVEN the most careful of smokers may accidentally drop a flaming cigarette somewhere unthinkable -- on new carpeting, perhaps. And even the most casual smokers tend to dislike any changes in the taste of their favorite brands.</p>
        <p>Knowing all that, Tyrone Murray, program director for research, development and engineering at Philip Morris U.S.A., has sought to make the burning cigarette less of a fire hazard. Over the last six years, Mr. Murray, a mechanical engineer who also holds an M.B.A., has led a team of 36 in creating PaperSelect, a paper with thickened bands that act as ''speed bumps'' in tempering the burn of a neglected cigarette. The new paper, now being used in the company's Merit cigarettes, may be used in other brands in the future.</p>
        <p>A dropped cigarette made from PaperSelect will not ignite other material as easily, and a cigarette left burning in an ashtray will go out faster if not being puffed.</p>
        <p>State legislatures across the country have been considering laws that require cigarettes to be self-extinguishing. This month, Gov. George Pataki of New York signed a bill that would mandate the switch by mid-2003. But last week, a measure in California died in legislative committee.</p>
        <p>For smokers, Mr. Murray said, the new cigarette paper ''tastes the same, and the health risks are no different.''</p>
        <p>He shares the patent for the banded paper technology with eight other people. One device creates the thicker bands, which are made of the same ingredients as in traditional cigarette paper; another ensures that the bands are of the correct size and spacing. Because the paper is otherwise the same, Mr. Murray was able to avoid changes in taste and puff quality that prove difficult for longtime smokers to accept.</p>
        <p>''We've been able to measure lower-ignition propensity in these banded cigarette designs,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Even with the new paper, however, fire hazards remain. As Mr. Murray noted, ''cigarettes do need to be lit and burned to be used.''</p>
