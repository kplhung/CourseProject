        <p>In that woozy, merry, end-of-the-party kind of voice, Dean Martin warbled a hit song years ago in which he was ''goin' back to Houston, Houston, Houston.''</p>
        <p>In more recent times, George Strait got a little more personal, and melancholy. ''All my exes live in Texas,'' he sang, ''and that's a place I'd dearly love to be. But all my exes live in Texas -- that's why I hang my hat in Tennessee.''</p>

        <p>In that woozy, merry, end-of-the-party kind of voice, Dean Martin warbled a hit song years ago in which he was ''goin' back to Houston, Houston, Houston.''</p>
        <p>In more recent times, George Strait got a little more personal, and melancholy. ''All my exes live in Texas,'' he sang, ''and that's a place I'd dearly love to be. But all my exes live in Texas -- that's why I hang my hat in Tennessee.''</p>
        <p>The Houston Comets, defending champions of the Women's National Basketball Association and leading in this year's finals against the Liberty by 1-0, had surely connected in a positive way with Dino, for they returned home to the Compaq Center for yesterday's Game 2 after slipping past the Liberty at Madison Square Garden on Thursday night.</p>
        <p>And given their druthers, the Liberty players, to be sure, would like to have joined George in Nashville, or Knoxville, or wherever it was he was ducking any former frau.</p>
        <p>In the two-of-three-game series, the Liberty understood that a victory at home to begin the series -- with the next game, and the third game, if necessary, set for Houston -- was significant. More than that.</p>
        <p>''It's imperative,'' Teresa Weatherspoon, the Liberty point guard, said before Game 1.</p>
        <p>''It's vital,'' Liberty guard Becky Hammon said.</p>
        <p>''What we have to do,'' Liberty forward Sue Wicks said, ''is steal a game in the Garden.''</p>
        <p>Steal a game! They were playing at home in New York. The Liberty had won 13 straight games at home. The team had even beaten Houston the last time they had played in the Garden, a 69-64 regular-season victory. You don't steal a victory at home, you take it!</p>
        <p>But such desperate talk may well have accorded insight into the hearts and minds of the Liberty players. It seemed they were digging themselves a mental hole, but no one could contest that they had a reason.</p>
        <p>For the amateur psychologists, however, they'd have another think coming.</p>
        <p>The Comets shot to a 14-2 lead yesterday, and it looked as if it would be curtains well before the intermission.</p>
        <p>But the Liberty came back and came back and came back and was tied with the Comets at 64-64. Here was Teresa Weatherspoon dropping in a 3-pointer and Tamika Whitmore and Tari Phillips and Crystal Robinson scoring big buckets. It took a spine-tingling 3-point shot by the indomitable Cynthia Cooper with 21.5 seconds left in regulation to give the Comets the tie and force the overtime.</p>
        <p>The Liberty was not only up against the only team to have won the W.N.B.A. championship in the four-year history of the league, but one seeking to become the first team since the 1980-83 Islanders of the National Hockey League to win four straight titles. The Liberty was also playing against a team that boasted the spectacular Sheryl Swoopes, the league's most valuable player; Tina Thompson, the M.V.P. of the league's All-Star Game; and the grand Coop. A formidable trio to say the least for any opponent.</p>
        <p>Cooper, the 37-year-old, 5-foot-10-inch super-duper star, has the ability to turn on her greatness at a moment's notice -- like pressing elevator buttons for higher and higher floors. She did it in Game 1 at the Garden, hitting for 20 points, including the drive that sealed the victory.</p>
        <p>Not only has Cooper given teams fits, but she has also given them nightmares, and indigestion as well. She had been the most valuable player in the finals in each of the last three seasons. And M.V.P. finals trophy No. 4 was within grasp.</p>
        <p>She was also the league M.V.P. in its first two years, an honor Sacramento's Yolanda Griffith won last season and Swoopes won this season. Cooper has announced her retirement after this series. She has been to this league what that guy with the Bulls was to his league, what Beethoven was to his, and Matisse to his.</p>
        <p>''I saw snapshots in my head of me sobbing after the game,'' Wicks said Friday afternoon, referring to the Liberty's loss in Game 3 of last year's finals.''I don't want to experience that again. It's a horrible feeling.''</p>
        <p>Her voice trailed off for a moment. After all, she has been with the team for all four years of its existence and had been on the two previous teams that came up short in the finals.</p>
        <p>''Well, we have our backs against the wall,'' Wicks said, ''but I think we play our best at times like that.''</p>
        <p>While the poet may wish for another expression, the cliche was excusable in this case because the Liberty responded just as she predicted.</p>
        <p>What wondrous energy and heart the Liberty demonstrated were not quite enough to subdue the Comets. The Liberty was outscored, 15-9, in the five-minute overtime, and wound up on the low end -- it is difficult to write ''loss'' or ''defeat'' in so valiant an effort -- of the 79-73 score.</p>
        <p>Before the game, Wicks said: ''There are two sides to the game. Someone's going to celebrate, and someone's going to cry.''</p>
        <p>When the game ended, the capacity crowd of 16,285 went wild for its hometown darlings, and confetti cannons under each basket shot up red, white and blue paper to create a literal blizzard.</p>
        <p>The Comets ran around the court holding up four fingers, indicative of their remarkable achievement, and Cooper got her fourth finals M.V.P., narrowly beating out Swoopes, who outscored her yesterday, 31-25. The Liberty players trailed off the court, their faces shadowed in disappointment.</p>
        <p>The snapshots in their heads, as time goes on, will surely remain vivid. One hopes that the pictures recall a thrilling, courageous challenge to a true champion. Both teams deserve that.</p>
