      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Early September. Football is just getting underway, and baseball is not yet into postseason. But there are other sports around. One is sheep dog trials. On Sept. 2, 3 and 4, fans can see plenty of broken-field running as border collies dash through Fosterfields Living Historical Farm in Morristown. And there will be the calling of signals as handlers guide the dogs by voice and whistles. And finally, there is the the crowning of a champion, as these are the New Jersey State Sheep Dog Trial Championships. Admission on Labor Day weekend to Fosterfields, 73 Kahdena Road, (973) 326-7645 will be $5; $4 for the elderly; and $3 for those aged 6 through 16. There will also be farmers in period clothing performing chores like spreading manure and churning butter and on Sept. 2 and 3, demonstrations of turn-of-the-century carriages by the Hunterdon Horse and Pony Club. Now that's something you don't get at halftime at Giants Stadium.</p>
