        <p>After 45 years as a bagpiper, Jonathan Henken has not grown tired of plaid. Not only does he still love bagpipe music, which he began playing as a lad of 10, but the world at large also appears to have caught the spirit. ''It's not just a Celtic thing anymore,'' said Mr. Henken, who has performed as a soloist at Carnegie Hall and is also pipe major for the Mount Kisco Highland Regimental Band. ''It seems to have become an American instrument.''</p>
        <p>Everyone wants a bagpiper these days, from newlyweds to pallbearers. Mr. Henken, who lives in Brewster, said he has never had so much fun. After telling you about the weddings, birthday parties and funerals he regularly plays, he casually mentions that afternoon's engagement. As the corporate piper for Forbes, he will be playing -- on a spectacular summer day -- aboard the company's yacht, Highlander, for some 150 guests. During one such gig he met Margaret Thatcher, who autographed a piece of bagpipe music commemorating the Falklands War.</p>

        <p>Another time he met James Galway, a memorable event for a fellow wind player.</p>
        <p>Mr. Henken will open Downtown Music's 13th season of Noonday Getaway concerts at Grace Episcopal Church in White Plains Sept. 20 at 12:35 p.m., piping a traditional program of Scottish music and military marches in the church's front garden. Information: (914)949-0384.</p>
