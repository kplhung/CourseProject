        <p>If Robert Frost were alive in this age of information, he might be prompted to write, ''Something there is that doesn't love a desk, that sends the worker's hand to clutter it.'' For all the effort that goes into the design of modern office space and furnishings, something deep in human nature seems to drive many people to bury themselves and their desks under all manner of paperwork, books, magazines, mementos and whatnot. To onlookers, the effect is one of chaos, but the mass of mess may sometimes be a mine of inspiration.</p>
        <p>''I once worked for a guy whose entire desk was stacked with paper in depths ranging from a foot to more than 2 feet,'' writes Kathy J. Volz, a marketing manager from Chicago. ''The only clear space on my boss's desktop was reserved for his telephone, his pipe stand and one square foot of writing area'' -- itself covered by a quarter-inch-thick computer printout that served as a blotter.</p>
        <p>''When the stacks on his desk became unstable, my boss moved the excess to paper stalagmites accreting on his floor,'' Ms. Volz recalls. ''These stalagmites ranged from unimpressive clumps of unopened  FedEx packages to two massive 3 1/2-foot-tall stacks of magazines behind his desk.</p>
        <p>''As an added wrinkle, my boss was not a very tall person, and the intervening wall of paper made sitting in his visitor chairs an interesting experience. If you were shorter than about 5 foot 5 and you sat in one of these chairs, he disappeared behind the crenellations of his paper fort.</p>
        <p>''If you were taller than 5 foot 5, you got treated to a peekaboo effect similar to seeing only the top of the head of Wilson on the television show 'Home Improvement.' ''</p>
        <p>''Technical research may not seem to be as strongly associated with paper generation as is office work,'' writes Wilbur S. Hall, a retired research chemist and inventor from Springvale, Me. But because they are so busy ''planning experiments, recording results and filing endless reports,'' scientists bemoan their paper workload, too, and resent any demand for more.</p>
        <p>He recalled one job: ''One of our hierarchical martinets decided that all scientists under his command must issue monthly reports detailing their activities for every 15-minute period. Included was the stern warning to include coffee breaks, or the report would be considered false.</p>
        <p>''In the first month, there were many marvels of creative writing, such as breaking down the 15-minute periods into even finer segments of boring detail or reporting more 15-minute periods than there are in a month.</p>
        <p>''By the second month, the reports were inexplicably dropped when large numbers of them were meticulously reporting that as much as two hours was required just for keeping track of the 15-minute periods.''</p>
        <p>Every desk starts out pin neat; the clutter arrives with the user, and, at least theoretically, should depart with him. But the people who inspect and clean rented office furniture after its return by customers say the mess on a messy desk all too often stays with the desk.</p>
        <p>Most of what the inspectors find is prosaic stuff -- folders of old paperwork, dried-up ballpoint pens, plastic packets of takeout duck sauce, maybe a cheap folding umbrella or a couple of pennies encrusted in spilled Wite-Out -- and, of course, paper clips beyond counting. But once in a while something odder, like a water pistol or a set of false teeth, turns up to snap the monotony and set imaginations spinning.</p>
        <p>At the Cort Furniture Rental warehouse in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, workers recalled opening the drawers of a returned desk recently and finding two surprises: a nearly new laptop computer and a box of condoms. Only the laptop was reclaimed.</p>
        <p>All those messy desks don't gladden the hearts of the people responsible for the original appearance of offices.</p>
        <p>''As an interior designer, I can't say I have solved any mysteries or found any hidden treasure at anyone's workstation,'' says Margaret Pook of Manhattan, ''but I am always surprised when I return to a space I have designed after a two-  or three-month period.</p>
        <p>''No matter how well we design a space, or add paper-management items or desk organizers, we never anticipate the stuffed animals, silk flowers and blow-up Godzilla dolls,'' she writes.</p>
        <p>''Personalizing one's desk is great, and I always try to leave room for family photographs and such, but the visual clutter, especially when it extends above the workstation height, contributes to an overall look of chaos and messiness within the space.''</p>
        <p>But chaos can be creative. Philip Seeman, a biochemical researcher from Toronto, says he can't vouch for every detail of this story of how a cluttered desk led to a Nobel Prize, but he says the broad outlines are accurate.</p>
        <p>It is the story of Earl W. Sutherland Jr., ''a physiologist who allegedly had a messy desk when he conducted pioneering studies on cellular signaling at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland in the 1950's,'' Mr. Seeman writes.</p>
        <p>''Each week, he covered the mess of papers and letters and reprints on his desk with a desk-size sheet of white paper until he had built up many layers, at which time he would clean up his desk at one shot,'' Mr. Seeman says. ''The story goes that a letter from Europe on a high layer described a new biochemical compound called cyclic AMP, while another letter situated several layers down from the top described an important biochemical reaction of tissue in response to a hormone.</p>
        <p>''Dr. Sutherland immediately realized that the two letters described two different aspects of the same process. He connected the two observations and soon discovered that hormones in general cause a change in the cyclic AMP inside all cells in the body that respond to a particular hormone. This explains how a hormone can be situated outside the cell but exert its effects inside the cell.</p>
        <p>''For this discovery, he won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1971.''</p>
