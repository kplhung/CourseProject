        <p>THE new Laguna Grille in Woodbury broke from the gate at a gallop. To enjoy the almost instant popularity it has achieved, just about everything has to be right from Day 1. Its tasty food, modest prices, snappy service and nifty surroundings have resulted in 20- to 30-minute waits for tables, even on normally slow weekdays. (Weekends are a hectic scene.)</p>
        <p>The restaurant, at 7927 Jericho Turnpike (516-682-8000), crackles with energy, excitement, enthusiasm and, unfortunately, noise. No wonder its tropical Latino-Caribbean creations have caught the fancy of local diners: they recognize value and creativity when they see and taste it.</p>

        <p>THE new Laguna Grille in Woodbury broke from the gate at a gallop. To enjoy the almost instant popularity it has achieved, just about everything has to be right from Day 1. Its tasty food, modest prices, snappy service and nifty surroundings have resulted in 20- to 30-minute waits for tables, even on normally slow weekdays. (Weekends are a hectic scene.)</p>
        <p>The restaurant, at 7927 Jericho Turnpike (516-682-8000), crackles with energy, excitement, enthusiasm and, unfortunately, noise. No wonder its tropical Latino-Caribbean creations have caught the fancy of local diners: they recognize value and creativity when they see and taste it.</p>
        <p>Augmented by an American twist or two, Laguna's menu fuses the boldly seasoned, diverse dishes of Cuba, Brazil, Puerto Rico, Costa Rica, Mexico and Spain. (It may be the only restaurant on the Island with no pasta on the menu.) Add huge portions and affordable prices, and you have a culinary hot spot.</p>
        <p>Entree-sized appetizers ($7 to $9), salads ($7 to $11) and especially sandwiches served with French fries, sofrito rice or a salad ($7 to $9) are the norm at this no-reservations storefront tucked in a corner of the Woodbury Village Shopping Center.</p>
        <p>Diners enter under a trellis lined with tropical vines, water trickles down a stone wall behind a tile-lined bar, sharp young black-clad servers swivel-hip their way around the bentwood chairs and long communal table under a skylight in the center of the room as palm-like fans sway in unison in the front window.</p>
        <p>A vibrant roasted-pepper dip, slim fried plantains and black yucca chips appear almost immediately. Although an array of margaritas, martinis, daiquiris, coladas, wine, beer and soft drinks are available, on each of my visits I opted for a non-alcoholic banana jammer ($4) and wasn't sorry. This banana smoothie, with a smidgen of pineapple, tastes like icy, golden-ripe liquid fruit.</p>
        <p>Speaking of fruit, diners with a bit of a sweet tooth will relish he many dishes containing pineapple, mango, citrus, fruit salsa and banana chips -- as well as rum, honey and sweet onion relish -- while those who don't consider sweet-and-meat combinations a treat have many other choices.</p>
        <p>Among the super starters are mesa chicken wings ($7), seven plump, sticky, snappy pieces, coated with chili-honey barbecue sauce; a man-sized tasty Cuban steak quesadilla ($8) stuffed with thinly sliced steak, runny smoked cheese and mushrooms topped with a batch of mellow sweet onion relish; and a fire-roasted vegetable quesadilla ($8), whose grilled vegetables, caramelized onions, plum-tomato relish and lightly applied smoky cheese are at least the equal of its meat counterparts.</p>
        <p>But a generous portion of Havana crab empanadas ($8), stuffed deep-fried turnovers, were filled not with crab shards but with a mash containing little discernible taste.</p>
        <p>A main course-size portion of calamari and cashew salad ($11), crisp ringlets of tiny, tender squid, plenty of nuts, mixed greens and ripe chopped tomatoes in a tangy sesame ginger dressing with toasted fusilli soaring antenna-like from its center, is the No. 1 salad pick. Close behind is a diced and delicious chopped barbecue chicken salad ($9) boasting moist chicken breast, tomatoes, scallions, corn, cucumbers, greens and shredded Jack cheese topped by delicate strands of crispy tortillas in a rich chipotle ranch dressing.</p>
        <p>A good creamy Caesar salad ($7) also satisfied, but its ''red chili croutons'' turned out to be slices of toasted bread contributing no particular flavor. A grilled vegetable salad ($8) was ordinary and its Caribbean vinaigrette dressing (with mango and guava) didn't add the expected pep.</p>
        <p>Two good deli-height sandwiches illustrate the kitchen's American slant. A Caribe club ($8) of turkey bacon, lettuce, tomato and mayonnaise on a warm Cuban roll tastes very familiar, as does a similar Laguna Grille sandwich ($9) of turkey, tomatoes, roasted vegetables, Jack cheese and mayonnaise. Ropa vieja ($9), thin steak, grilled peppers, Jack cheese and that sweet onion relish on a hearth-baked Cuban roll, is another good selection, but a slightly sweet curried chicken roll-up ($8) had no recognizable curry flavor.</p>
        <p>Sweet, too, but more satisfying are coconut-crusted, rum-glazed shrimp ($16) over lively sofrito rice and tossed in a husky, honey-rum pineapple mojo. Shiny, mildly sweet samba salmon ($13), with a light chipotle barbecue glaze; gallitos ($12), or cubed chicken and beef on lettuce with bean tostadas; and mellow brown caramelized garlic chicken ($14) with sturdy, noteworthy mashed potatoes and grilled corn are all recommended main courses.</p>
        <p>The hands-down dessert pace setter is a chocolate carmel mirage ($6), a big ball of vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce crowning two layers of chocolate cake and a layer of nut cream with whipped cream galore. A hot apple crunch a la mode ($7) of granola, ice cream and caramelized apples is a respectable alternative, but the only flavor produced by a bowl of rice pudding ($4.50) came from its mango and toasted coconut topping.</p>
        <p>When crowded, which is most of the time, the hard-surfaced Laguna Grille is shoutsville, but most of the food is so good and inexpensive that no one seems to notice.</p>
