        <p>GLEN BAISLEY'S fascination with horror films began when he sat on his father's lap watching Chiller Theater on television.</p>
        <p>Now, he is turning his lifelong passion into an independent film. To this end, he is putting 19 actors and 40 extras through their paces in venues from Pleasantville to Putnam Valley and from New Rochelle to Bear Mountain.</p>
        <p>''To say that this movie is just a horror film would be wrong,'' Mr. Baisley said. ''It has a little bit of slasher, a little thriller and leans heavily on psychological terror. Most of all, it's a good old-fashioned whodunit.''</p>
        <p>Hoping for a spring or summer 2001 debut, Mr. Baisley has his eye on the Rome Film Center in Pleasantville for the movie's first screening. From there, he would like to tour the local film festivals and sci-fi and horror conventions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baisley, a freelance videographer and writer who also manages the electronics store Cousins Audio Video in Pleasantville, has set his budget for the film, titled ''Fear of the Dark,'' at $8,000, though he confesses that the figure is likely to go up.</p>
        <p>To keep costs to a minimum, he is shooting with a mini digital video camera.</p>
        <p>''Although Mini DV is not as widely accepted as 16 mm or higher formats,'' Mr. Baisley said, ''it is quickly gaining respect among moviemakers and opening the floodgates for budding enthusiasts.''</p>
        <p>Ed Shelinsky of Putnam Valley is a phone company worker who is acting in the movie and choreographing the fight scenes. He said the minimal budget presents challenges, like the extra time it takes to film a scene, since there is only one camera, rather than four or five shooting a variety of angles at once.</p>
        <p>Many of the all-volunteer cast and crew perform double duty. Anthony Eikner of Fishkill, who has a role in the film, is also the makeup artist, the special-effects man and a stuntman in the film. Kirk T. Larsen from Hicksville on Long Island, who is serving as a production consultant and acting in the film, explained that this is not unusual, as he recently had 14 jobs while shooting an independent film.</p>
        <p>The female principal in the movie, Rosemary Gore of Manhattan, has a number of regional theater appearances and 15 independent films to her credit. She portrays Alice Walker, a character she describes as ''very unbalanced.'' Mike Lane of Smithtown on Long Island plays opposite Ms. Gore. This is his eighth independent film, but his role as Michael is his first lead. He describes this role as his meatiest to date.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baisley said he has been in awe of the unfolding project as the characters have materialized through the actors. As writer, director and producer of the movie, he said, ''It's such a thrill to bring to life something that you've created.''</p>
        <p>When it comes to marketing his film, Mr. Baisley finds himself in a situation similar to that of many independent producers: he has yet to arrange distribution.</p>
        <p>Though he sees some parallels with ''The Blair Witch Project,'' another independent film made by unknown filmmakers with a minimal budget, he has no illusions about repeating its success.</p>
        <p>''Forget the Academy Awards,'' he said. ''I will know I have finally made it when I can stand before an audience at one of these conventions and have them adore me for the hard work that I have done.''</p>
