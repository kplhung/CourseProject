        <p>In December, a federal judge was told that Wen Ho Lee posed such a threat to national security that if he leaked the nuclear weapons secrets he had allegedly taken from the Los Alamos National Laboratory it could tilt the global balance of power. Dr. Lee was held in solitary confinement without bail pending trial.</p>
        <p>But now the balance of power has shifted in the courtroom. The judge reversed his decision after hearing new evidence, ruling that Dr. Lee could be freed to a form of home detention. The order was a sign that, after admissions by prosecutors that misleading testimony had been presented earlier, the government's case was suffering serious weaknesses.</p>
