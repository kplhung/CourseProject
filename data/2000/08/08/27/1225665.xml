        <p>TEN years ago, Rosie McGuire and Gordon Joseph Weiss met when they were invited to read for parts in a movie. Besides a devotion to acting and a willingness to survive on tuna fish sandwiches until the next part, they both lived in tiny, rundown studios in Chelsea. After the reading, they ran into each other in the neighborhood laundromat or picking up Chinese food, and while he never appeared interested in her, she pined for him.</p>
        <p>''It was seven years of crush,'' said Ms. McGuire, who is in her 40's and played Jennyanydots in ''Cats'' in the early 1990's. ''I was very attracted to his talent and intensity. Plus, he's beautiful. He's a cross between Kirk Douglas and Sam Shepard, with a little Willem Dafoe sprinkled on the side.'' Ms. McGuire is known among her friends for her bright red hair and disarming directness. If her feet hurt, no matter where she is, she takes her shoes off.</p>

        <p>TEN years ago, Rosie McGuire and Gordon Joseph Weiss met when they were invited to read for parts in a movie. Besides a devotion to acting and a willingness to survive on tuna fish sandwiches until the next part, they both lived in tiny, rundown studios in Chelsea. After the reading, they ran into each other in the neighborhood laundromat or picking up Chinese food, and while he never appeared interested in her, she pined for him.</p>
        <p>''It was seven years of crush,'' said Ms. McGuire, who is in her 40's and played Jennyanydots in ''Cats'' in the early 1990's. ''I was very attracted to his talent and intensity. Plus, he's beautiful. He's a cross between Kirk Douglas and Sam Shepard, with a little Willem Dafoe sprinkled on the side.'' Ms. McGuire is known among her friends for her bright red hair and disarming directness. If her feet hurt, no matter where she is, she takes her shoes off.</p>
        <p>In fact, he also had a seven-year crush on her. ''I thought someone that gorgeous and vivacious and open must have a list of boyfriends,'' said Mr. Weiss, who is also in his 40's. ''She must be taken.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Weiss's life has not been easy, and it shows on his weatherbeaten face. He grew up on a small North Dakota farm and often helped his father, a house mover, by crawling into foundations and chasing out raccoons and snakes. But he always dreamed of acting. So in the 1970's, he rode a bus to New York, began taking acting lessons, drove a cab and moved into a single-room-occupancy hotel. ''I spent 11 or 12 years in one room, bathroom down the hall,'' he said. ''You always brought your Ajax, Lysol and Comet to the shower stall.'' He added, ''I starved plenty.''</p>
        <p>He eventually began getting work on Broadway -- as a swindler in ''Jelly's Last Jam'' and as a pimp's muscle man in ''The Life,'' the Cy Coleman musical. ''He's delightfully insane,'' said Chuck Cooper, who appeared with him in ''The Life.'' ''His inner child is ever so apparent.'' Another friend, Terrie Curran, said, ''Gordon is one of the last cowboys.''</p>
        <p>In 1996, the conversations between Ms. McGuire and Mr. Weiss began lasting longer each time they bumped into each other. She even started calling him, asking for a male point of view on problems she was having with her boyfriend.</p>
        <p>When her boyfriend broke her heart, she called Mr. Weiss. ''I said, 'You have to meet me at the Film Center Cafe, and I'm going to cry my eyes out!' '' she recalled. ''That was our unofficial first date, and we had such a good time I didn't cry at all.''</p>
        <p>After that, he often invited her over to watch old movies on his half-broken television. ''We'd kiss a lot and talk about theater,'' she remembered. ''Gordon would always be preparing food for me. He'd cut up little oranges and make omelets. I was like: 'Who are you? You must be a Martian.' I'd never had anybody treat me like that before.''</p>
        <p>A loner who used to cook a small Cornish hen for himself every Thanksgiving, Mr. Weiss recalled being amazed that Ms. McGuire was interested in him. ''She has so much heart and passion and soul,'' he said, ''I still think, 'Wow, she likes me!' ''</p>
        <p>Months after they began dating, she moved her belongings, armload by armload, into his Chelsea studio, which was not exactly built for two. ''There's a bathtub in the kitchen,'' she said. ''You can make your coffee and take a bath at the same time. It was definitely a challenge to our sense of humor.''</p>
        <p>As one of their friends, Dan Martin, said, ''Their life is a roller coaster, and they ride it beautifully.''</p>
        <p>On Thursday, Aug. 17, 40 friends gathered for their wedding at the Molly Pitcher Inn in Red Bank, N.J. Everyone cried, tears streaming down their faces like raindrops on a windowpane. ''If Gordon is a cowboy, then Miss Rosie is the wisecracking saloonkeeper,'' Ms. Curran said at the wedding. As for living with Miss Rosie, the bridegroom said, ''It's like no cover, no minimum, a constant source of entertainment.''</p>
