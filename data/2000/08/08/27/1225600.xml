        <p>Hold on to your salt. Your margarita is in danger.</p>
        <p>Tequila, the foundation of one of America's favorite summer drinks, is in short supply. It's all part of a silent crisis taking place in bars around the world, with chilling repercussions here in New York City. And, since bartenders are reluctant to share such grave news, the drinking public doesn't even know it's happening.</p>
        <p>It all began about 10 years ago in the high plateaus of Jalisco, Mexico, where the world's supply of blue agave, from which tequila is made, is grown. At the time, there was a glut of agave, so many farmers let their fields go fallow. But because agave needs 8 to 12 years to mature, there is less tequila available now.</p>
        <p>To make matters worse, tequila is enjoying greater popularity in the United States today than it did 10 years ago, so demand far outstrips supply, and tequila distributors are already facing spot shortages, according to the Consejo Regulador del Tequila, a Mexican government agency.</p>
        <p>The result?</p>
        <p>''All of a sudden the price on tequila started going up and the supply of pouring tequila, or well tequila, began drying up,'' said Ken Kessler, general manager of Manhattan Chili, which has two restaurants on Broadway.</p>
        <p>Instead of increasing frozen margarita prices to about $10 from about $7, to keep up with rising costs, Mr. Kessler took a bold step. He experimented and developed the Rum Rita, a margarita sans tequila. With, you guessed it, rum.</p>
        <p>Though the idea of a margarita with rum horrifies tequilaphiles, ''the response has been very positive so far,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Other restaurants haven't been forced to such extremes, but they have increased prices. David Garcia, manager of Mi Cocina, a Mexican restaurant in the West Village, said that about two months ago he was forced to raise his margarita prices to about $9 to $10 from about $5 to $7, depending on the quality of the tequila.</p>
        <p>''It's hard on us,'' he said. ''You never know if you can get it. If you pay $20 or $30 today for one bottle of tequila, next month it could be $45. It's scary.''</p>
        <p>Gabriela's, a Mexican restaurant with two locations on the Upper West Side, is in a bind because it serves nothing but tequila. Joseph Aguilar, the owner, says he has upgraded the tequila in his margaritas because higher-grade brands have not been in such short supply.</p>
        <p>''We're going to stay with our concept, just tequila,'' Mr. Aguilar said. ''The route for us to go was to make a better-quality margarita, cope with the price increase.'' He has raised his margarita prices 50 cents.</p>
        <p>But while bar owners are scrambling, city drinkers are still in the dark about the crisis.</p>
        <p>''Tequila shortage?'' said Zachary Fink, throwing back a margarita at Mi Cocina on a recent night, without a care in the world. ''Are you kidding?''</p>
