        <p>Former Newark Mayor Kenneth A. Gibson asked a federal judge this week for taxpayer support in defending himself against a bribery and fraud indictment in connection with his engineering consulting firm's supervision of work on a $50 million Irvington school rehabilitation project. Mr. Gibson sought to keep the lawyer who has represented him for the last four years as the United State's Attorney's office here has been investigating the Irvington project. But he said that he was unable to afford her fee of $425 an hour.</p>
