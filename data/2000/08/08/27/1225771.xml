        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Bob Lamm's Soapbox essay, ''Saying Goodbye'' (Aug. 13), recalls a long-forgotten memory from the early 50's. My future husband and I were young, in love and unemployed actors. Daily we would fulfill the actor's ritual of making the rounds, leaving our resumes and pictures at agents' offices. Then we would meet in the Automat on Times Square. We could sit for hours in the large room that was the haven of many unemployed actors. Quietly moving among us was Josie, who cleaned the tables. She was a shy, older woman, with an accent of perhaps Slavic origin. She was present yet not intrusive, an important part of that place, who gave a normalcy to the strange life of constantly looking for work.</p>

        <p>Bob Lamm's Soapbox essay, ''Saying Goodbye'' (Aug. 13), recalls a long-forgotten memory from the early 50's. My future husband and I were young, in love and unemployed actors. Daily we would fulfill the actor's ritual of making the rounds, leaving our resumes and pictures at agents' offices. Then we would meet in the Automat on Times Square. We could sit for hours in the large room that was the haven of many unemployed actors. Quietly moving among us was Josie, who cleaned the tables. She was a shy, older woman, with an accent of perhaps Slavic origin. She was present yet not intrusive, an important part of that place, who gave a normalcy to the strange life of constantly looking for work.</p>
        <p>Finally, he and I married. A year later, we were riding the subway when we were descended upon by an overjoyed Josie who could see that I was pregnant. She had wondered often what had happened to the young lovers. Had they fought and parted or left for other, warmer climes? To discover that we were married and about to become parents gave her great joy. We hugged and kissed and cried and then said goodbye. We left with a sense of completion. We never knew her story but she had become a part of ours.</p>
