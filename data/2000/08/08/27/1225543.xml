        <p>There is a game people play when they visit Rob Polishooks's home in Summit. It's called ''How many things have chili peppers on them?'' (The answer: 35). There are chili designs on the plates, chilies on the cups, chilies on the napkin holders, a chili welcome rug, not to mention the chili peppers and hot sauces in the closets. The decor is fitting for a man who is the founder and co-owner of Chile Today-Hot Tamale, an East-Hanover-based food business created from the fiery chili pepper.</p>
        <p>The company produces kettle chips (cooked more slowly than the usual commercial chips) and pretzels, 15 types of dried chilies, hot sauces, powders and chili-seasoned trail mixes. It has also helped spread the word that chilies have flavors as well as heat.</p>

        <p>There is a game people play when they visit Rob Polishooks's home in Summit. It's called ''How many things have chili peppers on them?'' (The answer: 35). There are chili designs on the plates, chilies on the cups, chilies on the napkin holders, a chili welcome rug, not to mention the chili peppers and hot sauces in the closets. The decor is fitting for a man who is the founder and co-owner of Chile Today-Hot Tamale, an East-Hanover-based food business created from the fiery chili pepper.</p>
        <p>The company produces kettle chips (cooked more slowly than the usual commercial chips) and pretzels, 15 types of dried chilies, hot sauces, powders and chili-seasoned trail mixes. It has also helped spread the word that chilies have flavors as well as heat.</p>
        <p>''Rising stars of the specialty food industry'' is how Gourmet News, a food industry publication, described Mr. Polishook, 40, and the co-owner, his stepbrother David Lipson, 30. Food critics have praised the company's seasoned chips and sourdough pretzels.</p>
        <p>To get an idea what they are selling, one chip's flavor is chipotle romano and herb, and another is cracked pepper and balsamic  vinegar. One pretzel flavor is roasted garlic and herb and there are various chili-flavored pretzels that include mild New Mexican and medium chipotle.</p>
        <p>A business that Mr. Polishook began 10 years ago in his living room, winding chilies into wreaths, now operates out of a 5,500-square-foot plant that produces 45 food  items, ships to 1,500 gourmet, gift and natural-food stores in every state in the nation,  to 100 outlets in Canada and to consumers around the world. Mick Jagger has called in orders, and Sylvester Stallone is another customer. The designer Nicole Miller liked the look of the products so much she designed scarves and ties with their chilies and bottled sauces on them.</p>
        <p>''The stuff flies off the shelves here,'' said Douglas Williams, manager of the Wild Oats Community Market in Madison, one of 80 Wild Oats stores that sell the Chile Today-Hot Tamale products. Other key outlets are Chef Central in Paramus, several Fresh Fields stores and Gary's Wine and Marketplace in Madison.</p>
        <p>Sales of Chile Today-Hot Tamale and other chili purveyors have been helped by the fact that America's appetite for hot spices has been growing, whetted by a new acquaintance with Southwestern cooking. By the end of the 1990's, United States spice consumption reached an all-time high of 968 million pounds, and most of the increase was in hot spices, according to the Food Institute, a nonprofit industry information group. Many people in the food business say  they learned what they know about chili from Chile Today-Hot Tamale.</p>
        <p>''I first met Rob at the Fancy Food Show in 1994 when I was covering it for 'Good Morning America','' said Bonnie Leblang, a  syndicated food columnist. ''He had products I had never seen before. He had a selection of every dried chili you could imagine and he would tell you how to use the different ones.''</p>
        <p>Sara Moulton, food editor of ''Good Morning America'' and executive chef of Gourmet magazine, fondly remembers the company's chili-of-the-month club, which has been discontinued. ''I joined the club to  educate myself,'' Ms Moulton said. ''As a foodie, it's important to know your chilies.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Polishook agrees. ''Chilies are like fine wines,'' he said in the office he shares with Mr. Lipson. ''There is not just one grape, and there is not just one chili.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Polishook is responsible for sales and marketing, and Mr. Lipson, responsible for operations and systems. How did two young men from New Jersey became obsessed with chilies? Mr. Polishook said he developed his taste for hot foods when he went to Tulane in New Orleans. Mr. Lipson said he simply always liked hot foods. ''In New Jersey 10 years ago you'd be dying if you were a spicy food fanatic,'' he said. ''It's like, this is crazy. I can't even go out and get a jambalaya.''</p>
        <p>Ten years ago, Mr. Polishook, a buyer of women's sportswear for Macy's, not only had a hankering for hot foods, he had a  yearning to start a little business. People might like dried chilies prettily strung together, he thought, so he wove them and sold them at craft shows. In making the chili braid, the peppers often broke. What to do with the bits and pieces? He put the chilies into little plastic envelopes, sealed them with construction paper labels and walked his products around to local food stores. All the while he nurtured a grand design.</p>
        <p>''You have a vision of where you want to go, of building the Chile Today-Hot Tamale brand, of taking this chipotle and other chilis into a sauce and other products,'' Mr. Polishook said. ''The question was how to teach people about the flavors, that it's not just hot, that ancho has a raisin flavor, that chipotle has a smoky natural earthy flavor?'' His answer was to come in 1996.</p>
        <p>In 1993, Mr. Polishook's stepbrother Mr. Lipson (Mr. Polishook's father and Mr. Lipson's mother married in 1990) came on board full time. A Rutgers graduate with a major in plant science and a minor in engineering, he had improvements in mind for machinery and a novel idea for killing the  insects that can inhabit dried chili peppers until they are exterminated by chili marketers. Some companies irradiate them, and others use methyl bromide to fumigate. Mr. Lipson chose a simpler route, free of radiation or chemicals. He froze the bugs to death, and many chefs liked the method.</p>
        <p>In 1994, there was an enthusiastic response to the products at the International New York Fancy Food Show. Gourmet magazine featured the company's ancho chilies. and sales of ancho chilies increased. The  company started a Web page (www. chiletoday.com) and provided information on labels about the differences between chilies and how they should be used.</p>
        <p>But building their customer base was still a struggle. Many still did not understand about chilies.</p>
        <p>''It was like, how can we get people to taste these products quickly?'' Mr. Lipson recalled. ''Well, how about a snack?'' In 1996 the company introduced a Seasoned Sourdough Pretzel Snack line, and in 1999, a line of seasoned kettle chips.</p>
        <p>''What actually ended up happening,'' Mr. Lipson said, ''was that people would try a particular flavor of pretzel, eat it and say, 'That's a great flavor.' And then we'd say, 'If you like our chipotle pretzels, try our chipotle chilies. Try our chipotle salsa. Try the pure powder and the chilies, and if you have gone through the chipotle stuff, what else can we do for you? Try the habanero.''</p>
        <p>He described this marketing strategy as cross-merchandising. Increased distribution is also the name of the game, he said, and his battle plan includes the military.  Military commissaries in Southern California and North Carolina already sell the  pretzels, and following the strategy of Chile Today-Hot Tamale, chili pods are on the way.</p>
