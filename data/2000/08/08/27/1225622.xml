        <p>TONY BENNETT certainly lives the good life. And he is about to share some of his sweet fortune with his former hometown of Englewood.</p>
        <p>The dapper crooner and his youngest son, Daegal, known as Dae, are in the process of building a state-of-the-art production center on the site of Englewood's downtown railroad station. Bennett Studios will incorporate music recording, television and cable production, as well as provide Internet production and Webcasting.</p>
        <p>''This will be a great cultural and economic asset to the community,'' said Mr. Bennett, in a phone conversation from Chicago, where he was performing. Currently enjoying his first sold-out world tour, he will appear at the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel, with the jazz singer Diana Krall, on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bennett, who recently turned 74, is the last of the great traditional pop singers. With the deaths of peers like Mel Torme and Frank Sinatra (whom Mr. Bennett called ''my best friend''), the singer may be the only link left to America's most popular musical tradition. And he holds that iconography with grace.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bennett lived in Englewood from 1957 to 1971, and Dae Bennett operates a successful recording studio there. His Hillside Studio is a small, one-room operation, but many top artists have recorded there, including Queen Latifah, George Benson and Dizzy Gillespie, another Englewood favorite son.</p>
        <p>The younger Mr. Bennett , 44, lives in Tenafly with his wife, Anita, and two teenage sons, Austin and Jared, but his artistic home is Englewood.</p>
        <p>He is pleased that his father encouraged him to proceed with the project.</p>
        <p>''It is a lot more ambitious than something I'd usually take on, but everything fell into place here,'' Dae Bennett said. ''We've had our eye on this great location for a while.''</p>
        <p>The Englewood depot has a long history. After serving for decades as the local train station, the building was leased out by the city through the Englewood Economic Development Corporation. The site has been the home to several restaurants, though none were profitable enough to remain. The Bennetts hope to retain the historic look of the slate-roofed Victorian brick building (with grand windows in the former waiting room).</p>
        <p>''This was a beautiful building in the perfect location,'' said Dae Bennett, though recording sessions must pause when the occasional train passes. ''We'll get 15 minutes notice.''</p>
        <p>The 6,500-square-foot studio, located at 1 Depot Square, off Van Brunt Street, otherwise known as Dizzy Gillespie Place, will also form a partnership with the nearby nonprofit John Harms Center, an old vaudeville theater that currently presents concerts ranging from rock to classical.</p>
        <p>The city is expected to build a trench between the two buildings so that a fiber-optic cable would connect them, enabling live recordings and other high-tech productions. Sixty-four channels of audio and video data will be broadcast between the two locations. Danny Bennett, Dae Bennett's older brother and Tony Bennett's manager, runs the A&amp;E cable series ''Live by Request,'' in which viewers call in requests for songs. He will bring his experience in televising shows to the studio operation.</p>
        <p>''The idea of recording classical performances and theater from there is making many people excited,'' Tony Bennett said. ''A theater like that is the perfect acoustic setup for symphonies and orchestras.''</p>
        <p>A Bennett Studios offshoot is the Tony Bennett Center for Media Arts, a school offering internships and educational opportunities to local students from Dwight Morrow High School. Dae Bennett will teach students who will create hands-on projects at the studio.</p>
        <p>Tony Bennett, who is also spearheading the Frank Sinatra School of Performing Arts in Astoria, Queens, said: ''What makes this project so exciting to me is bringing kids into the studio and giving them an opportunity to learn about recording, to teach them about the music business. It opens up the world to them.''</p>
        <p>Bennett Studios will feature two large rooms, one specializing in mixing, the other, a 50-by-30 space, will specialize in recording. There will also be a computer editing room and an area for Internet and Web-based media. There will be receptacles for cameras to offer clients streaming potential.</p>
        <p>Dae Bennett said an important design aspect was that the studios look homey. ''For many artists this will be their home away from home,'' he said. ''It has to be comfortable, and not look like a dentist's office.'' The Bennetts expect the center to open in February.</p>
        <p>''Our interest is to bring the industry into Englewood,'' Tony Bennett said. ''There are a lot of technical and musical people already there.</p>
        <p>''It's perfect. It's close enough to the Apple, but there are no police sirens or ambulances. Celebrities will be utilizing the businesses downtown, going to restaurants, shopping. It will be like our own Rodeo Drive.''</p>
        <p>The studio will also pay homage to Tony Bennett's career. ''It's equivalent to a presidential library, a reflection of his life's work,'' his youngest son said. ''It will include his artwork, memorabilia and music.</p>
        <p>''We're talking about a man who is incredibly gracious and classy. I want this to be a living legacy to him.''</p>
        <p>Tony Bennett, who has been singing professionally for 50 years, is humbled by the idea of the studio, but even more so about working with his sons. ''When I think of my father who came to the United States with $35 in his pocket, I know how blessed I am.</p>
        <p>''I get to sing and paint, my two favorite things. And I get to share all this joy with my family who I love. I never dreamed it could get this magnificent.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bennett also has two daughters -- Joanna, an actress, and Antonia, who is currently attracting attention as a jazz singer.</p>
        <p>The studio will also be a place for  lectures, and eventually outside concerts. ''Just give me a drum roll, and I'll come out and sing,'' warned Mr. Bennett, ''and I look forward to bringing in many of my artist friends to record here.''</p>
        <p>Mayor Paul Fader of Englewood is optimistic about the project. ''This is one of the greatest things to happen to the city,'' he said. ''This will make Englewood the entertainment capital of Northern New Jersey.</p>
        <p>''Tony Bennett has the pizazz, prestige, name recognition, talent, and ability to pull this thing off with class.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bennett has always been regarded as a class act.</p>
        <p>''I did get shaken when the Beatles came out,'' he recalled. ''I didn't know what to do, if I should change my style or not. But I never changed, and I think that's what people like. I never try for fads. I just try to sound good and keep singing good songs that never sound dated. I won't compromise my music. My saying is, 'When you're hot, keep going.' ''</p>
        <p>And it is not just former bobby-soxers who go mad for Mr. Bennett; the MTV generation does as well.</p>
        <p>''I am so pleased I've been embraced by the rock crowd,'' he said. ''Some of those musicians have become great fast friends, like Sting and Elton John.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bennett, who paints every day, is also an artist of some renown. ''It is such a surprise when my paintings fly off the walls. What a feeling of confidence and encouragement.'' He was recently commissioned to design the official poster for the Kentucky Derby.</p>
        <p>''A painting makes you fall in love with life,'' he said, as he prepared to take a four-hour preconcert break to paint at Lake Michigan. ''When you paint nature, you say, 'What a miraculous world we live in.' It's the search for truth and beauty.</p>
        <p>''Singing is more extroverted. You help people forget serious problems and make people feel good.''</p>
        <p>Backed by the Ralph Sharon Quartet in concert, Mr. Bennett sails through a repertory that covers several decades. His songbook is vast, from George Gershwin to Duke Ellington to ''Steppin' Out,'' the MTV-driven song that made him a pop-culture icon. He also shares two duets with Ms. Krall.</p>
        <p>An impeccable musician and remarkable showman, the high-styled Mr. Bennett has left his mark in music and art worlds.</p>
        <p>''He might have left his heart in San Francisco,'' said Mayor Fader, ''but he will be leaving his legacy in Englewood.''</p>
