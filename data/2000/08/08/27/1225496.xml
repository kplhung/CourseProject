        <p>PIERRE BOULEZ'S ''Structures,'' Book 2, for two pianos is music of uncompromising complexity. In this landmark exploration of rigorous serial techniques, composed over several years beginning in 1956, the pianos go at each other nonstop, exchanging volatile volleys of notes with a ferocity that seems almost free-form. At the time of its premiere, in 1961, the work galvanized composers in the avant-garde and in academic circles. Few people could have thought that it would ever reach outside to mainstream audiences. Certainly not audiences at the Salzburg Festival, then the most tradition-bound of all the prestigious international music festivals.</p>
        <p>So it must have been deeply satisfying for Mr. Boulez -- or perplexing, or amusing, or who knows what? -- when, at the conclusion of the third of four recent concerts at the Salzburg Festival in honor of his 75th birthday, an audience that nearly filled the 1,500-seat Felsenreitschule burst into cheers after a brilliant performance of that very work, the gnarly ''Structures,'' Book 2. The superb pianists were Pierre-Laurent Aimard and Florent Boffard. Joining them on stage for the ovation, Mr. Boulez was called back four times.</p>
        <p>Among the listeners were many younger people, the kind of music lovers who would never have been at the Salzburg Festival 10 years ago. But also in the audience were patrons dressed in evening finery, the type of veteran festivalgoers who are more typically seen next door in the best seats (about $320 each) at the Grosses Festspielhaus for performances of Mozart and Strauss operas.</p>
        <p>All of the Boulez 2000 concerts, including two programs that Mr. Boulez conducted with the London Symphony Orchestra, were well attended and enthusiastically received. Once a cocksure revolutionary, Mr. Boulez has become the benevolent elder of the Salzburg Festival. On a particularly humid morning, one saw an amazing thing: latecomers, flushed and perspiring, scurrying into the Festspielhaus, hoping that good seats were still available for a free talk by Mr. Boulez.</p>
        <p>What's going on? Naturally, Mr. Boulez deserves most of the credit for his own success. Perhaps he knew all along that there could be a potential audience for work like his, even among concertgoers reared on mainstream repertory.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Boulez's ascendancy at the Salzburg Festival is also due to the efforts of Gerard Mortier, its artistic director since 1992. When he arrived, Mr. Mortier vowed to shake the place up, to present the opera repertory in boldly rethought productions, but most of all to make the festival, finally, a hospitable place for living composers as well as musicians from cultures far outside the Austro-German heritage. One of his first acts was to appoint Mr. Boulez composer in residence in 1992.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mortier has also relied on Hans Landesmann, the unsung hero of the Mortier era. Mr. Landesmann is officially the intendant, or executive director, of the festival. But since he has a musical background, he has also served as the de facto artistic director of concerts there. Under his leadership, the festival has complemented Mr. Boulez's work by introducing other new-music offerings, like the Composer Portraits programs, and the Next Generation series, financed by the Los Angeles arts patron Betty Freeman.</p>
        <p>There was new music at Salzburg before Mr. Mortier's era, but not much, and that, Dr. Landesmann explained recently, was kept to the side, done out of obligation rather than enthusiasm. The climate has changed for good.</p>
        <p>The most anticipated event last summer was the premiere of Luciano Berio's opera ''Cronaca del Luogo.'' Similarly, the most important event of this summer was the premiere on Aug. 15 of Kaija Saariaho's opera ''L'Amour de Loin,'' to a libretto by Amin Maalouf, commissioned jointly by Salzburg, the Theatre du Chatelet in Paris and the Santa Fe Opera. And prodding Mr. Mortier along in his commitment to new opera has been Mr. Boulez, who praised Mr. Mortier's sense of mission during his recent talk. As of now, a new opera commissioned by the festival will be a highlight of every season: works by Matthias Pintscher, Wolfgang Rihm, Hans Werner Henze and Olga Neuwirth.</p>
        <p>At least that is the plan. Mr. Mortier is leaving after the season next summer amid much contention. From the start, he faced resistance among the festival's entrenched supporters, both public and private, who had been content to see the event showcase lavish, regally cast productions of operas by Mozart and Strauss, and elegant concerts of traditional symphonic repertory performed with silken excellence by the Vienna Philharmonic.</p>
        <p>But last year, as is well known, the backlash became more pointed when the national elections gave the right-wing Freedom Party the clout to claim a role in Austria's governing coalition. Some talk from party leaders suggested that its members were a little less than condemning of Nazi politics. And now, along with alarming anti-immigrant cant from the government coalition have come troubling cuts in social services.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mortier and his staff were appalled by the turn of events. They also faced a dilemma. The Salzburg Festival has relied on government funds, though much less than is generally thought. The combined allocations from four public sources -- the Austrian republic, the Salzburg tourist bureau, the city fund and the county fund -- account for only 28 percent of the festival's budget (which this year amounts to roughly $42 million). Over 50 percent comes from ticket sales, a worrisomely high figure.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mortier's artistically exciting programs have proved costly and run up deficits. But the government's pleas to rein in costs have come amid political rhetoric about elitist contemporary music and injunctions to maintain the country's artistic nationality. ''We are told by some that the festival should be more Austrian, whatever that means,'' Mr. Mortier said disdainfully, while introducing the creators of ''L'Amour de Loin'' at a panel.</p>
        <p>MR. MORTIER'S first response to the new government's challenge was to announce his resignation as of this year. Among those who persuaded him to change his mind was Mr. Boulez, who urged him to use the post to make a point. So Mr. Mortier will turn the festival next summer, his last, into a veritable celebration of multiculturalism, then cede his post to Peter Ruzicka, a German composer and conductor, and also an admiring colleague of Mr. Boulez, who increasingly seems a power behind the scene.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Ruzicka continues to give Mr. Boulez a central role in the Salzburg Festival, he should enjoy public support. Elsewhere Mr. Boulez's very name may rattle classical-music audiences, but here listeners seemed genuinely intrigued by his challenging music and disarmed by his charming intelligence.</p>
        <p>On one level, the performances themselves assured a strong response. In 1976, Mr. Aimard, then just 19, began an 18-year association with Mr. Boulez's cutting-edge Ensemble Intercontemporain. He is an extraordinary technician and a compelling musician. His solo recital at the Mozarteum, the first of the Boulez 2000 concerts, was astonishing. He gave impressive accounts of works by Messiaen, Bartok and George Benjamin. But especially in two early works by Mr. Boulez, ''Notations'' and the First Piano Sonata, Mr. Aimard brought lucid clarity, impetuosity, tenderness and great dabs of color to fiendishly difficult piano music. As an encore he played a work even many pianists consider formidable listening, Webern's Variations (Op. 27), in a sensitive, involving and beguilingly fanciful performance.</p>
        <p>In the third Boulez 2000 concert, at the Felsenreitschule the next day, Mr. Aimard made Berg's harmonically wayward Sonata (Op. 1) seem positively Brahmsian, gave a gripping account of Schoenberg's breakthrough Five Piano Pieces (Op. 23) and, with the excellent flutist Sophie Cherrier, offered a continually imaginative performance of Mr. Boulez's early Flute Sonata.</p>
        <p>Then Mr. Aimard's younger colleague, Mr. Boffard, a member of the Ensemble Intercontemporain since 1988, joined him in ''Structures,'' Book 2. Music gets no more formidable than this. But no matter how many musical events tumbled on one another -- darting contrapuntal lines, splatterings of notes, undulating shimmers, hellbent outbursts of chords that climaxed with clusters played with the flats of the hands and forearms -- the music sped by with uncanny clarity. This work may be tough to comprehend, but as played here, it made you giddy with amazement.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the impact of Mr. Boulez's music was in part a reaction to the soupy neo-Romanticism that has become so fashionable in the last 20 years. However momentarily placating, some of those sumptuously scored neo-Romantic works just don't stay with you. But Mr. Boulez's music is something genuine and ingenious. Everyone must at least concede that.</p>
        <p>Of course, listeners may be more willing to take a chance on Mr. Boulez's music because over the years he has earned their gratitude as a conductor. His conducting was always technically deft and intellectually solid. In his mature years he has allowed his music-making, and his own works, to become more elegant, pliant and playful.</p>
        <p>Most of the pieces he performed here with the London Symphony he had already presented with the orchestra at Carnegie Hall last season, including Mahler's Sixth Symphony, given a somewhat fussy account. Peter Eotvos's ''zeroPoints'' and Ms. Neuwirth's ''Clinamen/Nodus,'' works commissioned for these birthday tours, are stronger for their explorations of tremulous colors and sounds than for their motivic cogency and rhythmic sway. Emanuel Ax, in sympathy with Mr. Boulez, made Schoenberg's 12-tone Piano Concerto seem the most lyrical music ever written. Mr. Boulez's performance of Stravinsky's ''Petrouchka'' was a revelation; I heard intricate inner voices and layered happenings in this familiar music that I had never known were there.</p>
        <p>It's easy for outsiders to say that Austria must come to terms with its fears of immigration and cultural change. Mr. Boulez is an outsider himself. And in helping Mr. Mortier open the festival to new music and bracing works by living composers, he has made it a more stimulating place to hear the ''Jupiter'' Symphony and ''Don Giovanni.'' Their opponents should remember that in his own day Mozart was a challenging composer of contemporary music. It's safe to say what side he would be on in Salzburg today.</p>
