        <p>Off the Beaten Path</p>
        <p>The two best running backs in the nation cannot be found in the Big Ten or the Southeastern Conference. You need to look to the Western Athletic Conference and Texas Christian, where LaDainian Tomlinson will begin a Heisman Trophy bid as direct as his Web site's name: www.LT For 2000.com Or to the Southern Conference and Georgia Southern, where Adrian Peterson is aiming at Division I-AA's career yardage record.</p>
        <p>Last year, T.C.U. went 8-4 and won its second consecutive bowl game because Tomlinson was impossible to bring down. The 5-foot-11-inch, 220-pound running back led the nation in rushing with 1,850 yards, averaged 168.1 yards a  game and set a National Collegiate Athletic Association record by running for 406 yards against Texas-El Paso. His feelings were bruised when he finished 14th in last year's Heisman race despite outgaining the winner, Ron Dayne.</p>

        <p>The two best running backs in the nation cannot be found in the Big Ten or the Southeastern Conference. You need to look to the Western Athletic Conference and Texas Christian, where LaDainian Tomlinson will begin a Heisman Trophy bid as direct as his Web site's name: www.LT For 2000.com Or to the Southern Conference and Georgia Southern, where Adrian Peterson is aiming at Division I-AA's career yardage record.</p>
        <p>Last year, T.C.U. went 8-4 and won its second consecutive bowl game because Tomlinson was impossible to bring down. The 5-foot-11-inch, 220-pound running back led the nation in rushing with 1,850 yards, averaged 168.1 yards a  game and set a National Collegiate Athletic Association record by running for 406 yards against Texas-El Paso. His feelings were bruised when he finished 14th in last year's Heisman race despite outgaining the winner, Ron Dayne.</p>
        <p>So he has set his sights on gaining 2,000 yards this year and at least getting an invite to the Downtown Athletic Club.</p>
        <p>For Peterson that number is 6,193 -- the I-AA career rushing record set by Jerry Azumah of New Hampshire from 1995-98. Peterson, a junior, already has 3,739 yards. He will not be overlooked anymore if he has a good performance against Division I-A Georgia on Sept. 2.</p>
        <p>Best of the Trenches</p>
        <p>He does not get as much attention as running back Anthony Thomas or wide receiver David Terrell, but Michigan's most decorated player is offensive guard Steve Hutchinson. He is the favorite for the Outland Trophy as the nation's best lineman and is a lock to be named all-Big Ten for the fourth year in a row.</p>
        <p>The Coach's Prerogative</p>
        <p>Last May, Kentucky Coach Hal Mumme decided to replace quarterback Dusty Bonner -- who led the Southeastern Conference in passing efficiency and yards in 1999 -- with a redshirt freshman with the build and bulk of a lineman: 6-4, 275-pound Jared Lorenzen. ''I was speechless,'' Lorenzen said when Mumme told him of the change.</p>
        <p>While Bonner transfered, Mumme, who polished Tim Couch, said he had chosen the right man to stretch the field. ''He's very accurate and has a good touch. He can take it off of it if he needs to. He's a great athlete.''</p>
