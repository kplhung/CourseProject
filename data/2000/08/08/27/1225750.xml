        <p>ON his first trip to Africa two years ago, President Clinton dreamed out loud that his journey would be remembered in a hundred years as ''the beginning of a new African renaissance.'' The president singled out four African heads of state whose free-market savvy would help revive the world's poorest continent.</p>
        <p>Since then, all four leaders -- in Uganda, Rwanda, Ethiopia and Eritrea -- have crippled their nations' economies by going to war.</p>
        <p>''We Americans are so desperate for good news on the continent that it is almost irresistible when we find a good man in Africa,'' said Edward P. Brynn, the former American ambassador to Ghana who greeted Mr. Clinton in Accra on the first leg of his 1998 trip. ''The only way we seem to be able to identify success in Africa is through personalization.''</p>
        <p>This weekend, on a return engagement in Africa, Mr. Clinton is again singing the praises of a good man in Africa. This time it's President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria, a former general who was elected last year to lead Africa's most populous country. The Clinton administration has seized on Mr. Obasanjo, whose victory ended years of military dictatorship, as an anchor of democratic stability in restive West Africa.</p>
        <p>Again, though, there are risks. Mr. Obasanjo presides over a country that is fractured north from south by Islamic extremism. Nigeria is the second-most corrupt nation on earth (after neighboring Cameroon), according to Transparency International, a nonprofit anti-corruption group based in Germany. The former general's record on human rights has already been stained by his order for soldiers to destroy a town in the oil-producing Niger delta. His top aides have been selling their influence.</p>
        <p>Echoing the concern of many longtime Africa watchers, Mr. Brynn, a former No. 2 in the State Department's Africa bureau in the Clinton administration, says the United States must resist the temptation of ''putting all our eggs in the personality basket.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Brynn and many others argue that the only way for Americans to help Africa in a meaningful way is to join with European allies in the slow and painfully complex job of rebuilding institutions that have been falling apart for decades. Most important are the civil service, courts, the police and the military.</p>
        <p>After the collapse of colonialism in the 1960's and the spread of self-rule across most of Africa, early American efforts to aid newly independent states foundered when grants were badly monitored and often stolen by corrupt bureaucrats. In the past decade, the United States and other chastened donors have tended to steer clear of direct aid to governments. Instead, they funnel money through private and religious groups whose work in health care, basic education and small-business development can be monitored more closely.</p>
        <p>Neither of these approaches, though, has helped cure a continentwide pathology that has turned many African governments into predators. Poorly paid policemen, soldiers and civil servants often use their authority to serve themselves, rather than the public. ''We failed to keep a real hands-on posture with aid,'' said Mr. Brynn, who served as a diplomat on the continent for 17 years in six different countries. ''We allowed a small, clever class that inherited power from the colonial masters to take us to the cleaners. It will take a whole lot of time and money to turn Africa around.''</p>
        <p>Except in Nigeria, South Africa and a handful of other countries, civil wars and corruption have swamped the African renaissance that Mr. Clinton envisioned two years ago. Much of the continent has resumed a long slide into poverty, war and disease -- a dismal trajectory that has excluded the region from the rapid free-market growth in much of the developing world. That painful pattern suggests that America's next president will be confronted by military and humanitarian crises in Africa that cannot be solved with foreign trips or inspiring speeches -- and quite possibly cannot be solved at all.</p>
        <p>Out of the 27 major armed conflicts in the world last year, 11 were fought in Africa. Five of the world's 10 most corrupt countries are in Africa, according to Transparency International. A peace deal for Sierra Leone, which the United States helped broker in 1999, collapsed back into war this spring, with United Nations peacekeepers taken hostage. As in Rwanda, where Mr. Clinton apologized two years ago for America's failure to prevent genocide in 1994, the continuing mess in Sierra Leone reveals an absence of international commitment to peacekeeping in Africa.</p>
        <p>THE AIDS pandemic has accelerated and is threatening to kill up to 25 percent of the population in some African countries. War in Congo has sucked in a half-dozen other African states and shows no signs of ending. A political and economic rot that African scholars call ''failed-state syndrome'' seems to be spreading from countries like Somalia and Sudan to what used to be models of stability -- Kenya, Ivory Coast and Zimbabwe.</p>
        <p>''It is a very frightening picture that we face in Africa,'' said J. Stephen Morrison, who left the State Department's policy planning staff last spring after four years of working on Africa policy. ''It makes people exceedingly uncomfortable.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Morrison, like many experts on Africa, agrees that the United States and European countries need to commit more money and more skilled people to rebuilding African governments. But like many others, he concedes that no one is sure about how to do it or how to persuade African leaders to allow what could be perceived as neocolonial meddling.</p>
        <p>''None of us have answers,'' he said.</p>
        <p>As director of the Africa program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, Mr. Morrison is preparing a nonpartisan review of Africa policy during the Clinton years to help inform the next administration. ''It is not clear that we have come to terms as a government and a nation about what is truly required to help Africa,'' he said. ''If we come in on the cheap side, it is going to backfire. I think it is fair to say that the Clinton administration has suffered from rhetorical excess in Africa and deficits in terms of will and material commitment.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Morrison said the administration has been quick off the mark with significant economic and military assistance to Nigeria. Aid there has jumped from $7 million a year to more than $200 million since Mr. Obasanjo was elected in February 1999. On his trip this weekend, the president is not expected to offer much more money.</p>
        <p>The stakes are especially high in Nigeria. With 113 million people and huge oil and natural gas reserves, the country has the potential to drive an economic revival in all of West Africa. It is also one of few African states where the United States has a real strategic interest. Oil from Nigeria and Angola accounts for about 16 percent of America's supply, a figure projected to rise to more than 25 percent in the next decade.</p>
        <p>Washington is also counting on Nigeria's armed forces to restore peace in nearby Sierra Leone. American troops began arriving in Nigeria last week as part of a $20 million program to train and equip Nigerian and Ghanaian soldiers for peacekeeping.</p>
        <p>''Are we hanging too much on Obasanjo?'' Mr. Morrison asked. ''That is clearly a danger we face. We have to invest in institution building -- the military, the legislature, getting a handle on corruption. But we cannot do any of this stuff on the cheap. It has got to be sustained beyond this president and beyond Obasanjo.''</p>
        <p>Spending by the United States government on development assistance in Africa has declined in the past decade. Aid to African nations peaked in the early 1990's at just over $800 million a year, dipped to $675 million in 1996 and grew this year to about $738 million. By comparison, Israel received about $900 million in economic support this year and Egypt about $760 million, according to the Congressional Research Service.</p>
        <p>The Republican majority in Congress has repeatedly cut the president's budget requests for Africa and has so far failed to approve an administration proposal to forgive about $475 million in African debt.</p>
        <p>Presidential trips notwithstanding, many experts on Africa (including several who have served in the Clinton administration) agree that Washington is not spending nearly enough money to sustain or even begin the kind of fundamental reform that is the only possible solution to the continent's complex problems. ''You are left with a very weak hand,'' said Gerald Bender, a professor of international relations at the University of Southern California and an expert on Angola. ''You do not have the means to initiate positive things or hold back problems like war.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bender and many other African specialists predict that until the United States is willing to work with Europe to pay for a kind of Marshall Plan for Africa, American presidents will have little choice but to follow Mr. Clinton's cheerleading example.</p>
        <p>Their role, by default, will be to heap praise on the good man of the hour in Africa and hope that he doesn't turn into a bad man who perpetuates his power by stealing his country's future.</p>
