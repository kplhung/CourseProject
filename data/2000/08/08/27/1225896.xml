        <p>Tom Hayden is at a new place in this life. And what a life -- radical organizer of Students for a Democratic Society, charter member of the Chicago Seven, freedom rider, grunt in the war on poverty, opponent of the war in Vietnam, Jane Fonda's former husband, unsuccessful candidate for governor of California, mayor of Los Angeles and United States Senator and, for the past 18 years, member in good standing (honest) of the august California Legislature, most recently as a state senator from Los Angeles.</p>

        <p>Tom Hayden is at a new place in this life. And what a life -- radical organizer of Students for a Democratic Society, charter member of the Chicago Seven, freedom rider, grunt in the war on poverty, opponent of the war in Vietnam, Jane Fonda's former husband, unsuccessful candidate for governor of California, mayor of Los Angeles and United States Senator and, for the past 18 years, member in good standing (honest) of the august California Legislature, most recently as a state senator from Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>The system -- term limits -- has finally caught up with him. Come adjournment next week, he is out of there.</p>
        <p>So it goes, senator, once you've opted to be co-opted.</p>
        <p>Maybe it's time to go, anyway. Last Wednesday, his legislative colleagues held a farewell ceremony for him -- a love-in, really -- that went on for two emotion-packed hours. It finally ended when he confessed, tears rolling down his cheeks, that while legislators should not ''meekly serve our time,'' he nevertheless had finally learned, thanks to the kindly patience of colleagues, that, well, ''you just don't get your way by insisting on it.''</p>
        <p>Roll over, Abbie Hoffman, and tell Bill Kunstler the news.</p>
        <p>So what's next for Mr. Hayden, now 60 and newly a father?</p>
        <p>Maybe the fire burns still.</p>
        <p>He was spotted marching with protesters in the streets of Los Angeles during the Democratic National Convention, and friends say he is mulling over whether to go after a seat on the Los Angeles City Council.</p>
