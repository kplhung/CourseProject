        <p>The incidence of diabetes increased sharply in the United States from 1990 to 1998, a consequence of rising levels of obesity. The trend is ominous: diabetes is already a major cause of blindness, kidney failure and leg amputations, and it greatly increases the risk of heart disease and stroke, the leading causes of death in the United States.</p>
        <p>In a report published in the journal Diabetes Care, researchers predicted that the problems would only get worse in decades to come.</p>
        <p>Thirteen million Americans have diabetes, and at least five million more are thought to have it without knowing it. Almost all the increase is in Type 2, or adult-onset, diabetes, the most common form of the disease, which is usually brought on by inactivity and weight gain.</p>
        <p>The yearly cost of diabetes is estimated at $98 billion.</p>
        <p>According to the report, the overall prevalence of diabetes rose to 6.5 percent of the population in 1998 from 4.9 percent in 1990. Among people in their 30's, the prevalence rose to 3.7 percent from 2.1 percent.</p>
        <p>During the same period, the proportion of people who were overweight rose to 54 percent, from 44 percent. Experts describe obesity as an epidemic in the United States, citing overeating and couch-potato lifestyles. Diabetes is not the only consequence: excess weight is also linked to high blood pressure, heart disease and circulatory problems, breathing disorders and arthritis.</p>
