        <p>''Alternative art'' and ''Wall Street'' are not generally heard in the same sentence. Yet merging these two worlds is the goal of Margaret Bodell, Caroline Kerrigan and Aaron Goranson, who recently opened the Wall Street Viewing Room at 5 Beekman Street. It is a gallery outside the mainstream in an area known for business suits and ties.</p>
        <p>The gallery, in a former office, opened on May 25. It is now exhibiting the experimental photography of John Coffer, whose work, tintype portraits of rural  life, captures the feeling of 19th-century photographs. Ms. Bodell, speaking of Mr. Coffer's work, said: ''It's like you're in a time warp. You know it's contemporary, but it doesn't look that way.''</p>

        <p>''Alternative art'' and ''Wall Street'' are not generally heard in the same sentence. Yet merging these two worlds is the goal of Margaret Bodell, Caroline Kerrigan and Aaron Goranson, who recently opened the Wall Street Viewing Room at 5 Beekman Street. It is a gallery outside the mainstream in an area known for business suits and ties.</p>
        <p>The gallery, in a former office, opened on May 25. It is now exhibiting the experimental photography of John Coffer, whose work, tintype portraits of rural  life, captures the feeling of 19th-century photographs. Ms. Bodell, speaking of Mr. Coffer's work, said: ''It's like you're in a time warp. You know it's contemporary, but it doesn't look that way.''</p>
        <p>To those who doubt a gallery can make it far from art centers like Chelsea and SoHo, Ms. Bodell and her partners say they expect theirs to thrive specifically because of its location. The area, they say, is not only full of historic charm, but filled with potential art patrons.</p>
        <p>In fact, they present their artists' works, tailored to specific tastes, to companies and individuals in the area.</p>
        <p>''I think a lot of businessmen and companies want to put something on their walls that inspires and means something, instead of just posters,'' Ms. Bodell said.</p>
        <p>After a recent presentation, the Viewing Room team persuaded the South Street Seaport Museum to display Mr. Coffer's work in its new addition.</p>
        <p>''We're making an investment in cultivating the arts in this area,'' said Mr. Goranson, who said the Viewing Room planned to hold corporate and public events, as well as sessions teaching the finer points of art collecting.</p>
        <p>''If you're showing good art, people will come,'' Ms. Bodell said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bodell is no stranger to showing alternative art in places off the beaten track. In 1992, she opened, on East Seventh Street, one of the few galleries in the East Village that feature emerging artists and outsider art, the work of artists like homeless people, prison inmates or mental patients.</p>
        <p>The three ardently support their quickly changing neighborhood. The newly renovated City Hall Park has beautified the area, low rents are drawing new residents, and many new businesses and projects are under consideration.</p>
        <p>''It's turning into a nice new community here,'' Ms. Bodell said, pointing out that lofts were replacing offices and artists were trickling in.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kerrigan added: ''It's an undiscovered place full of character. It's not pretentious like Chelsea or SoHo.'' But, she added: ''I want the business to do well, but I don't really want the area to be discovered. I like it the way it is.''</p>
