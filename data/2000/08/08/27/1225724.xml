        <p>HAS the Japanese stock market returned to the doldrums?</p>
        <p>The Nikkei index of 225 stocks, which shot up 37 percent in 1999, has fallen 19 percent since April, to 16,911.33, and is now down 11 percent this year. The broader Topix index of more than 1,400 stocks, which surged 58 percent last year, is also off 11 percent for the year.</p>
        <p>The Japanese economy, despite hopes for a rebound, is still struggling to prove it is alive. The central bank's recent decision to raise the benchmark interest rate, albeit to just 0.25 percent, is worrying some analysts. Corporate restructuring is advancing, but too slowly, some say. And the government has still not found a brand of leadership that is encouraging to foreign investors.</p>
        <p>All this has led W. George Greig, international portfolio manager at the William Blair International Growth fund in Chicago, to conclude that Japan is not a great bet now. A year ago, more than 25 percent of his portfolio was devoted to Japanese stocks like Sony; Rohm, the semiconductor manufacturer; NTT Docomo, the cellular phone company; and Kyocera, the electronic equipment maker, among other Japanese stocks. But that is down to 10 percent now.</p>
        <p>One reason for Japan's market decline is that the same stocks that powered the rally -- technology and telecommunications shares -- crumbled earlier this year, as they did worldwide. The decline in the Nikkei was accelerated by the switch this spring of 30 old-economy stocks for 30 new-economy ones. Ian Macdonald one of the Tokyo managers of the Japan Fund from T. Rowe Price, said the Nikkei would be closer to 19,000 now if the old stocks were still in it.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Greig, Japan also ''still has an intractable political and leadership crisis.'' Corporate restructuring -- one of the great hopes for Japan's future -- is still going too slowly, he said. ''I want to see where the growth trend goes and where the profit picture is'' before buying again, he said.</p>
        <p>Some international fund managers still like Japan -- not that they are much more optimistic about the political, economic and restructuring outlook. But because the Japanese market has fallen so much recently, and because the economy has been down for so long, they see many good opportunities for investors who do their homework.</p>
        <p>''You can always find some decent stocks in Japan,'' said Bill Bower, manager of the Fidelity International Growth and Income fund. ''I am not afraid of Japan.''</p>
        <p>He owns telecommunications, media and technology stocks. He also predicts that brokerage firms, including Daiwa Securities and Nomura Securities, will do well, especially as more Japanese transfer their savings out of the country's postal savings system.</p>
        <p>His favorite and largest holding is Furukawa Electric, which has two things going for it: a burgeoning spot in the fiber optic cable business and a big ownership stake in JDS Uniphase, which makes components for fiber optic networks. While many of the stocks that led the Japanese stock rally last year have declined sharply, Furukawa stalled only recently. It was up 303 percent last year and 126 percent this year until it peaked on Aug. 15. Yesterday it closed at 3,080 yen, still up 99 percent for the year.</p>
        <p>All this puts Japan at about 20 percent of the assets in Mr. Bowers's fund. So he is positive, but not going out on a limb. According to Morningstar Inc., the average exposure to Japan for international funds, which exclude the United States, is 19.7 percent.</p>
        <p>David Mannheim, portfolio manager of the MFS International Growth fund, is as positive as Mr. Bower. He likes Canon, the copier and camera company, and NTT Docomo. He is generally staying away from ''wholly domestically oriented'' companies,  because their performance would depend too much on the Japanese economy's improving. Still, he has shares of Fast Retailing, which he calls Japan's counterpart to Wal-Mart.</p>
        <p>But remember this caution from Tom Van Leuven, global equity market strategist at J. P. Morgan, , who is even more bullish on Japan. He would not be pushing Japan as hard if the Nikkei index were suddenly back at 20,000. So the window of opportunity may be very small.</p>
