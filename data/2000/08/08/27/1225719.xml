        <p>IN the last two and a half years, Jerry W. Levin has managed to bring some order to the chaos that once prevailed at the Sunbeam Corporation, the household appliance maker that installed him as chief executive after the notorious ouster of Albert J. Dunlap in 1998. But it has not been easy.</p>
        <p>He inherited a company that, after Mr. Dunlap's abrupt reorganization, had factories that were in disarray, employees who were demoralized and retailers who were infuriated.</p>
        <p>A former chief executive of both Revlon Inc. and the Coleman Company, Mr. Levin, 56, was sent in by Ronald O. Perelman, the billionaire financier who owns 34.5 percent of Sunbeam. Among Mr. Levin's burdens: interest costs on $1.6 billion in long-term debt and $800 million in zero-coupon bonds due in 2018 but redeemable in three years, losses of $1.2 billion over the past two years and a continuing Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into accusations of accounting fraud that date from 1998. Mr. Dunlap has not gone away, either. He contends that the company owes him $5 million in back salary.</p>
        <p>Also clouding the picture is a consolidated shareholder lawsuit that was filed after Sunbeam's stock fell 50 percent in one month in early 1998. On Aug. 17 of this year, the stock hit a new low, $1.75, and it closed at $2.06 on Friday. The suit contends, among other things, that the company misrepresented the health of the operations and future prospects to inflate the price of the stock. A trial is set for next June.</p>
        <p>Despite the turmoil, analysts and shareholders give Mr. Levin credit for improving operations. William Steele, an analyst at Banc of America Securities, pointed to a number of signs of health, including increased cash generated from sales -- $28 million, up from $20 million last quarter -- and increased manufacturing efficiency, demonstrated by Mr. Levin's ability to keep the gross margin flat despite a 3 percent decline in revenue last quarter. ''My belief is that they are working their way up,'' Mr. Steele said.</p>
        <p>Recounting his early days at Sunbeam, Mr. Levin said that on his second day, he started calling the chief executives of major discount retailers, like Wal-Mart Stores and Kmart, to begin repairing fractured relationships. ''Once they finished venting, it was my turn to beg,'' Mr. Levin said last week in an interview at Sunbeam's headquarters here.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levin's most immediate challenge is the debt. The company's fate is precarious until it can be lowered.</p>
        <p>He has held lenders at bay -- Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, First Union National Bank and Bank of America have a $1.7 billion I.O.U. due in 2005 and 2006 -- and installed executives to rev up the product segments. He is creating joint licensing agreements. And he recently sold Eastpak, the backpack maker, for $89.9 million to the VF Corporation. Earlier this month, Mr. Levin also put up for sale a unit that makes electric clippers and other products for barbers and animal groomers.</p>
        <p>But there is more: He tossed out product lines like a water purifier that had been heralded as a $100 million revenue generator but whose sales proved to be disappointing. And he pumped more than $60 million into research and development that now is putting new products on the shelves. Those include fuel-cell-powered generators that are scheduled to go on sale next year, as well as linked, high-technology household products like an alarm clock that automatically starts a coffee maker. The company also introduced a new line of Coleman outdoor grills and updated versions of pressure washers for contractors and homeowners.</p>
        <p>It may all be meaningless, however, if Mr. Levin cannot reduce the debt. In the first half of this year, with interest expenses of $109 million, the company lost $139.6 million on sales of $1.15 billion. This summer, Sunbeam had cash and cash equivalents of $25.9 million versus total debt of $2.4 billion.</p>
        <p>If he cannot, well-known brands like Mr. Coffee, Coleman and Oster may end up on the auction block. If Mr. Levin succeeds, however, his long-term plan for recovery has a chance. ''Jerry's plan is well thought out -- getting it executed is another thing,'' Mr. Steele said.</p>
        <p>The first challenge is to restructure the bonds that the company sold in March 1998 to provide cash to buy Coleman, the camping outfitter.  ''Now that we feel the businesses are fixed and doing well, this is No. 1 on our list,'' Mr. Levin said.</p>
        <p>It has to be. If Sunbeam cannot swap the notes for bonds with different terms, bondholders could take control of the company. Under current provisions, bondholders could start calling in their chips in 2003.</p>
        <p>Sunbeam cannot pay cash because covenants with lenders forbid it; the company has to offer stock. But if Sunbeam were to satisfy the redemptions, bondholders could end up holding 61 percent of the stock. The biggest loser would be Mr. Perelman, who owns 37 million shares and has long looked to Mr. Levin as a strategist and turnaround executive.</p>
        <p>In July, Sunbeam made an initial offer to bondholders that could have called in $500 million in debt, but when the offer expired on Aug. 7, there were few takers. Sunbeam has extended the offer to Sept. 12.</p>
        <p>BUT even Mr. Levin does not expect bondholders to accept the offer. He has been flying around the country, meeting with them one on one to negotiate a deal. The rub for bondholders is that the offer on the table gives them only a 23 percent interest in the company, or 34.2 million shares. ''Sunbeam didn't offer them enough of the company,'' said M. Shawn Foley, a bond analyst at Merrill Lynch Global Securities.</p>
        <p>Besides, Sunbeam was offering the same terms for all the bondholders. Those who bought in initially at $37.42 on $100 do not want to swap out on the same terms as speculators who more recently paid just $5 to $10, said Jonathan S. Mack, a lawyer in Minneapolis for four firms that got into the original bond offer and who filed a lawsuit contending fraud similar to that claimed in the stockholders' lawsuit.</p>
        <p>Many shareholders besides Mr. Perelman are unhappy about inevitable further stock dilution in any deal with bondholders. ''You know it needs to be done, but you hate to get more diluted,'' says Douglas Herold, a securities analyst at Invista Capital Management, a subsidiary of the Principal Financial Group. Invista is  the third-largest shareholder, with six million shares, though it sold about one million during the past year.</p>
        <p>Aside from the bonds, there are tens of millions of stock options floating around; many are exercisable at $7 a share. MacAndrews &amp; Forbes, Mr. Perelman's company, has warrants to buy 23 million shares of common stock at $7 a share, part of a settlement it made with Sunbeam after the stock price plummeted after the purchase of Coleman. Lawsuits by other shareholders are challenging that settlement. Other Coleman shareholders received warrants to buy 4.98 million shares and lawyers in the case received 498,000 for fees and expenses.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Levin and other top executives joined Sunbeam in the summer of 1998, they received 2.8 million options exercisable at $7. Most are Mr. Levin's. In the three-year contract that Mr. Levin signed in January, he received options to buy three million shares at $4.125 each.</p>
        <p>The uncertainty about dilution has kept Sunbeam's stock in the subbasement. ''It's difficult for Wall Street to come in and make this investment,'' Mr. Levin conceded. ''They don't know how many shares are going to be outstanding. It's hard to calculate. They can take it right down to earnings, but can't take it down to earnings per share.</p>
        <p>''Until we give Wall Street some guidance about what we've done to our capital structure,'' Mr. Levin added, ''it's a gamble, it's a bet, it's a risk.''</p>
