        <p>During the 1980's and 1990's, Richard Vague built First USA, where he was a co-founder, from one of the first stand-alone credit-card companies into Visa's largest issuer. But after Bank One bought it in 1997, First USA stumbled against newer and nimbler rivals. Mr. Vague, now chief executive of Juniper Financial, an Internet bank based in Wilmington, Del., left First USA with an important lesson: be a specialist.</p>
        <p>''Commercial banks are unfocused,'' he said. ''They're trying to run 10 or 20 different businesses, so they're never consistently reinvesting in the technology and marketing and advertising in any one of them.''</p>

        <p>Mr. Vague hopes that honing in on one business will draw customers away from traditional banks. Juniper, formed in January, will accept customers this fall. In July, Mr. Vague reached an agreement to allow deposits at 3,400 Mailboxes, Etc., locations.</p>
