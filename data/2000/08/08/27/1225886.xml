        <p>The debate over the tax cut plans of Representative Rick A. Lazio and Hillary Rodham Clinton continued today, with Mrs. Clinton calling Mr. Lazio's proposal ''fiscally irresponsible'' and saying that it was likely to increase the national debt.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, meanwhile, said Mrs. Clinton's plan was not in the best interest of New Yorkers.</p>
        <p>Speaking to a group of Democratic women at the Nyack Center, a community center, Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic candidate for Senate from New York, portrayed herself as a key member of the Clinton administration team that reduced the national debt. She tried to tie Mr. Lazio to conservative Republicans in Congress who had proposed large tax cuts.</p>
        <p>Today was the first day that Mrs. Clinton herself directly criticized Mr. Lazio's tax plan. In the last few days, Mrs. Clinton's aides have criticized Mr. Lazio's proposal to use a projected $4.4 trillion, 10-year federal budget surplus to cut taxes.</p>
        <p>The centerpiece of the plan, which Mr. Lazio outlined Thursday in a speech in Amherst, would allow taxpayers to deduct from their federal income taxes the payroll tax, which finances Social Security.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton said she believed that the Lazio plan would waste the surplus and stifle the economic boom.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Lazio has a tax plan that is fiscally irresponsible and the numbers don't add up,'' she said. ''It's not going to give one penny to prescription drug benefits, Medicare or putting down the debt, things I've supported.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton said Mr. Lazio's proposal mirrored those advocated by House Republicans when Newt Gingrich was the House speaker.</p>
        <p>''This is right out of the Newt Gingrich, George W. Bush Republican playbook,'' Mrs. Clinton said.</p>
        <p>But the Lazio campaign defended its plan today, saying it would actually bring prosperity to blighted areas of the state. ''Mrs. Clinton doesn't trust New Yorkers and believes only Washington bureaucrats know how to spend our hard-earned money,'' Mr. Lazio said in a statement.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's plan would trim taxes by $496 billion over 10 years, and include a cut in the so-called marriage penalty, but not eliminate it.</p>
        <p>Organizers of Mrs. Clinton's appearance here said the event was hastily put together over the last five days to win support among female voters. Recent polls have shown that Mrs. Clinton is not doing well among white women, though her support among black women remains strong.</p>
