        <p>GIVEN that both sides are bracing for a down-to-the-wire presidential race, the nationally televised debates between Gov. George W.

        <p>GIVEN that both sides are bracing for a down-to-the-wire presidential race, the nationally televised debates between Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore could be especially crucial. For millions of Americans, it may be the first -- and only -- time they eyeball the two rivals for longer than a few-second snippet on the news or in a commercial.</p>
        <p>But to listen to many strategists and pundits, Democrats and Republicans alike, Mr. Bush might as well put away his briefing books and sit out the debates. The common wisdom is that Mr. Gore -- the oratorical slayer of Ross Perot, Jack Kemp and Bill Bradley -- is such a vaunted debater and Mr. Bush is such a novice, sometimes even a stumblebum, that it would be like watching a karaoke competition between Barbra Streisand and a barroom crooner. Bush officials angled for advantage last week in negotiating the debate roster, a move Gore aides said was intended to find a format with smaller audiences and moderators hospitable to the governor.</p>
        <p>The truth is that Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush are more evenly matched than people think. Mr. Bush could even come out ahead.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has had years of debate training and is known for absorbing every fact and angle -- and using them to pound like a jackhammer at his opponent. Mr. Bush, by contrast, had taken part in just two debates before the primaries, against his rivals for governor of Texas in 1994 and 1998.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Bush improved significantly during the primaries. And if he can harness his easygoing charm, he might come off as less intense and more appealing than Mr. Gore. After all, Ronald Reagan vanquished President Jimmy Carter in 1980, not because he had a better command of issues -- he did not -- but because he could better connect with the audience when he admonished Mr. Carter, ''There you go again!''</p>
        <p>''If Bush can do to Gore what Reagan did to Carter -- make him look pedantic, like a wonk who is out of touch -- he may very well prevail,'' said Alan Schroeder, a political scientist and the author of ''Presidential Debates: Forty Years of High-Risk TV'' (Columbia University Press, 2000). ''If the debate turns a little more on content, then obviously Gore is in an advantage here.''</p>
        <p>Debates are all about expectations, which are decidedly rock bottom for Mr. Bush, and his aides are doing their best to keep them that way. ''I've watched the tapes,'' said Mr. Bush's communications director, Karen P. Hughes, ''and Vice President Gore has a carefully schooled and trained technique.''</p>
        <p>Even as other campaign officials were attacking Mr. Bush last week as too timid to  debate, William M. Daley, the chairman of the Gore campaign, tried to raise expectations for his opponent. ''If you see the tape of the Richards-Bush debate,'' he said, ''he did just fine.''</p>
        <p>IF fine is coming through without being bloodied, Mr. Bush did survive an hourlong tussle in 1994 with Gov. Ann Richards, who was one of the Democrats' biggest stars. She was funny and sarcastic; he was not, but was unruffled and stuck to his message.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, by most experts' reckoning, is an adroit debater. Yet some of his successes had a lot to do with weak opponents. In the primaries, for example, Mr. Bradley was lackluster and afraid to counterattack aggressively. And in what was perhaps Mr. Gore's best-known debate, on the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993, Mr. Perot was not as well prepared -- and let himself become rattled.</p>
        <p>Before those matchups, when Mr. Gore went up against Vice President Dan Quayle, who was much maligned for his oratorical skills (or lack thereof), Mr. Gore was not particularly impressive. In fact, many analysts said Mr. Quayle did as well as or better than his opponent. Several times Mr. Quayle tried to goad Mr. Gore into defending President Clinton, saying, ''Bill Clinton has trouble telling the truth.'' Some Democrats skewered Mr. Gore after the debate for not sufficiently defending the president.</p>
        <p>Debates are not merely the measure of who can best roll out the facts, but who can appear most confident and comfortable under excruciating pressure.</p>
        <p>''I think Bush has the advantage, oddly enough, entirely because of the expectations game,'' said Senator Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican.</p>
        <p>Still, the Bush camp seems apprehensive. The campaign proposed five debates this year, two between the vice presidential nominees. But unlike the Gore campaign, the Bush organization has not agreed to the proposal offered by the Commission on Presidential Debates, a bipartisan group that has sponsored debates since the 1988 campaign. The commission has proposed three presidential debates in October.</p>
        <p>Bush officials said they want to consider all the possible formats; Gore aides say their rival is afraid to meet them head on. There is a history in the Bush family of reluctance to debate: former President George Bush took part in debates in 1988 and 1992, but only after protracted negotiations with the debate commission. In a town meeting-style debate with Mr. Clinton in 1992, Mr. Bush seemed so bored that the camera caught him glancing at his watch.</p>
        <p>Debates often produce memorable moments (Remember Mr. Reagan vowing not to ''exploit'' Walter F. Mondale's youth and inexperience in 1984?) and can give a significant lift to a candidate (Mr. Perot in 1992) or highlight a weakness (President Gerald R. Ford saying in 1976 that Poland wasn't under Communist domination).</p>
        <p>But experts agree that the last time presidential debates made a definitive difference was in 1960, when John F. Kennedy came off, or at least looked, far smoother than Richard M. Nixon.</p>
        <p>Usually, however, debates simply reinforce existing allegiances toward a candidate. That could be different this year, though, because since there is no incumbent running, the debates will give many Americans their first and possibly only opportunity to scrutinize Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore side by side.</p>
        <p>The public's verdict could be based on deep policy considerations or on trivia, like what they think of a candidate who cannot  keep his smirk in check or one who sometimes seems to verge on condescension.</p>
