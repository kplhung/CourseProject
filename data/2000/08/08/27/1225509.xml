        <p>The Costa Rican Tourism Institute, which oversees the national tourist board, has created a Web site with a listing of hotels that have been rated for their efforts to improve the environment.</p>
        <p>Each hotel that applies for a voluntary Certificate of Sustainable Tourism from the institute undergoes a two-day inspection. In addition to the hotel's ecological effects, the inspection looks at the impact of the hotel on the quality of life and the cultural heritage of its community.</p>
        <p>The certification program considers the interaction between the hotel and its habitat; its water, energy and product management systems; the relationship between the hotel and the local community and culture, and to what extent its guests are invited to participate in the hotel's efforts. The hotel is rated from 1 to 5, with 1 the lowest rating in any category, and each hotel receives an overall rating.</p>
        <p>The Web site, www.turismo-sostenible .co.cr/EN/home.shtml, available in English and Spanish, provides a directory searchable by province, number of rooms, the hotel's setting and its level of certification. None of the 46 certified hotels has achieved a 5 over all, but three have earned a 4: Observatorio Volcan Arenal in Alajuela Province, near the country's most active volcano; Heredura Hotel, a resort and conference center in Heredia Province; and the Rosa Blanca Country Inn, also in Heredia.</p>
