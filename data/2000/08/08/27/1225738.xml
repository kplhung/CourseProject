        <p>THE law of supply and demand is a powerful thing. And right now that power may be why the Nasdaq composite index seems stuck in a maddening sideways groove.</p>
        <p>From June 1 to mid-July, Nasdaq ran up 26 percent, teasing investors back into technology stocks that had been hammered just weeks earlier. Then, to the disappointment of investors, the stocks lost steam. In addition, while other broad indexes have recently seen an improvement in breadth -- increasing numbers of stocks that are rising -- the Nasdaq has not.</p>
        <p>Fred Hickey, editor of The High-Tech Strategist, an investment newsletter in Nashua, N.H., is surprised by none of this. The action in Nasdaq this summer, he says, is inextricably linked to changes in the supply of and the demand for its companies' stocks. As supply dwindled, stocks rallied. When supply rose, stocks stalled.</p>
        <p>There are several sources of Nasdaq supply, of course, the biggest being the issuance of new shares by fledgling companies. The number and size of initial public offerings waiting in the wings has ballooned since the spring, as the market has proved unwilling to absorb the supply. According to Thomson Financial Securities Data, some 280 companies are awaiting their debuts. These companies, mostly technology concerns, hope to raise around $36 billion from investors by the end of the year. That is about the same amount raised in initial public offerings in all of 1998.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hickey senses that issuers and bankers are increasingly antsy about getting these deals done. ''With the Nasdaq as weak as it has been this year and all the stories of Internet bankruptcies, there is a tremendous urgency to go public,'' he said. ''Wall Street is going to feed as much as they can and more to the market here.''</p>
        <p>Another considerable source of supply is companies that recently went public whose insiders are allowed to sell their shares. Under the terms of so-called I.P.O. lockup restrictions, insiders cannot sell their shares until about six months after a public offering; at that time, millions of shares of  stock can be sold.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hickey believes that when huge numbers of lockups expire, Nasdaq struggles. In May, according to IPOlockup.com., insiders at 63 companies were free to sell 2.7 billion shares. Nasdaq fell 12 percent that month. In June, the shares available for sale dwindled to 1.3 billion shares, and the Nasdaq rose 17 percent.</p>
        <p>Now, however, the lull is over. By the end of the month, some 1.7 billion shares issued by 53 companies will have been unlocked. And in September, 1.8 billion shares in 45 companies will be free to trade for the first time. Happily, the shares available for sale drop to about half that level in October.</p>
        <p>Of course, the insiders whose shares are unlocked may not want to sell their holdings. But since so many of these stocks are trading well off their highs, insiders may want to get out while the getting's good.</p>
        <p>There are other supply sources that may put pressure on Nasdaq in coming weeks. Mr. Hickey pointed out that there would be  enormous stock and bond offerings by European telecommunications companies looking for funds to pay for spectrum technology licenses they are buying in government auctions. The Netherlands, Britain, Germany, France and Belgium are all auctioning Internet spectrum to companies that will have to issue securities to pay for it.</p>
        <p>Will demand for these shares and bonds be enough to soak up the supply? Perhaps. But early fall, Mr. Hickey noted, is not known as a time for strong mutual fund or stock market inflows.</p>
        <p>This fall could be different, of course. But swallowing $36 billion of new equity issuance will be a lot for even this bull market to stomach without a hint of indigestion.</p>
