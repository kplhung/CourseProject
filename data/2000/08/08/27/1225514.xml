        <p>To the Editor: Contrary to the impression that obtaining a certificate for an unsatisfactory trip on Amtrak is relatively simple, requiring 15 days or less (''Amtrak's New Approach Comes With Guarantees,'' July 30), my recent experience has indicated that it is not only tedious but almost impossible.</p>
        <p>After a particularly difficult trip from Washington to New York June 26, marked by a one-hour delay in arrival, no air-conditioning for a similar period and outright dissembling about the delay while two other Amtrak trains were available to reach New York earlier, I wrote on July 2 detailing our problems. There was no response, nor was there any to a follow-up letter on July 24.</p>

        <p>To the Editor: Contrary to the impression that obtaining a certificate for an unsatisfactory trip on Amtrak is relatively simple, requiring 15 days or less (''Amtrak's New Approach Comes With Guarantees,'' July 30), my recent experience has indicated that it is not only tedious but almost impossible.</p>
        <p>After a particularly difficult trip from Washington to New York June 26, marked by a one-hour delay in arrival, no air-conditioning for a similar period and outright dissembling about the delay while two other Amtrak trains were available to reach New York earlier, I wrote on July 2 detailing our problems. There was no response, nor was there any to a follow-up letter on July 24.</p>
        <p>As a last resort I called the number for the Satisfaction Guarantee. The response of the agent, while polite, was not encouraging: namely that I should hear from Amtrak in a few weeks but only to ask that the original ticket stubs be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested.</p>
        <p>In other words, I should expect to receive my certificate six to eight weeks after the problem, assuming a favorable reply. I can only congratulate the 2,987 lucky individuals who received their certificates within 15 days.</p>
        <p>NELSON MARANS  Silver Spring, Md.</p>
        <p>Steven Taubenkibel, a spokesman for Amtrak, responds: Mr. Marans's train encountered a delay of 59 minutes between Washington and Baltimore because of engine problems. Amtrak received Mr. Marans's July 2 letter one week later. We have sent him a transportation credit. Amtrak has received a tremendous amount of correspondence as a result of our Satisfaction Guarantee announcement. We do respond to each and every letter we receive, and we apologize for the delay Mr. Marans encountered.</p>
