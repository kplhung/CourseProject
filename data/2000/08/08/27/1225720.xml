        <p>A former tobacco warehouse on Water and Dock Streets has been through a lot in the last hundred years. First, the city sliced off a chunk of the structure to build New Dock Street.

        <p>A former tobacco warehouse on Water and Dock Streets has been through a lot in the last hundred years. First, the city sliced off a chunk of the structure to build New Dock Street. Then an owner lopped off three of its five stories. It was struck by lightning, and gutted by the resulting fire. Last fall the landmarked building was almost demolished until preservationists stepped in. Late last month, with stabilization work in progress, neighbors were stunned to discover a 40-foot hole in its waterfront side.</p>
        <p>A gigantic hole was knocked ''in what is a very, very important piece of history,'' said Patricia Crow, who lives near the state-owned building.</p>
        <p>''We're just furious about it.''</p>
        <p>Randall Sawyer, a spokesman for the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, said the hole was made accidentally when workers were clearing debris from inside the building, which has been empty for decades. ''The contractor was removing a roof joint, which triggered the fall of bricks,'' he said. ''They will be picked up and assembled, and the archway will be replaced according to historic standards.''</p>
        <p>Winthrop Aldrich, the office's deputy commissioner for historic preservation, added that the hole, which reaches from the top to the bottom of the building, ''would have happened to anyone who had done the work.''</p>
        <p>But Al Lopez, a park ranger, said that while earlier clearing was done by workers removing debris by hand, the hole was made after they switched to a crane. ''My question was, why didn't they continue moving things by hand?'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sawyer said that while a small bulldozer was used inside the building, the crane was used only outside. Asked if the work was speeded up to meet a deadline, he said, ''There was no deadline.''</p>
        <p>The building, part of a complex of warehouses that includes the adjacent, more intact Empire Stores, lies within the Empire-Fulton Ferry State Park. Built between 1870 and 1885, the complex was declared a landmark in 1977 and acquired by the state the following year. In recent years, there has been talk about converting it to art galleries, artists' studios, boutiques, cafes or a theater.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sawyer said the work was prompted by safety concerns, like falling bricks. He said the state had not yet chosen a use for the building.</p>
        <p>Marianna Coval, executive director of the Brooklyn Bridge Park Coalition, said the leading proposal was to convert the building into a walled garden and cafe.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lopez said he liked that idea. ''When it was all collapsed it was a sanctuary in there, with birds nesting,'' he said. ''It was its own ecosystem. You could recapture that.''</p>
