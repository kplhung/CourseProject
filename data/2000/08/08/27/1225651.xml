      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>One of the sweetest, most soulful voices in the American musical canon is that of Smokey Robinson. A crooner, a rocker, he teases and taunts. Bob Dylan, considered by his fans to be the greatest living poet, called Mr. Robinson, ''the greatest living poet.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Robinson's latest album, 1999's ''Intimate,'' was a collection of slow to midtempo love songs, but the album failed due to over-polished production and a generic R&amp;B style. He's better than that -- ''Shop Around,'' ''Mickey's Monkey,'' ''I Second That Emotion'' and ''Tracks of My Tears'' were not flukes.</p>

        <p>Although he left his group 28 years ago, Smokey is still a Miracle. He will appear tonight at the Count Basie Theater, Red Bank, (908) 842-9000.</p>
