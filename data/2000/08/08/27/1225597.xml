        <p>BEFORE she opened Niecy's, Denise Hampton says, she sat outside the storefront for two days and counted the people going by on Valley Street. It didn't take her long to conclude that the area could support the restaurant she had in mind, a place that would serve the kind of food she remembered from girlhood in Little Rock, Ark.</p>
        <p>It was a shrewd bet. In the two years since Niecy's opened, just about everything has gone right for downtown South Orange, and Niecy's is one of those things.</p>
        <p>A village that was seriously down on its luck, with 20 percent of its stores having closed by the early 1990's, it began to perk up with the inauguration of direct rail service to Manhattan in 1996. An energetic nonprofit group called Main Street South Orange helped get tenants back in those stores and channel redevelopment around the train station.</p>
        <p>Today there are few vacancies. A $10 million arts center is about to rise next to the station. There are street fairs and a weekly farmer's market. And South Orange is starting to look less like a suburban basket case and more like a destination.</p>
        <p>A significant part of its success lies in its racial diversity, which is very much on display at Niecy's. Denise Hampton (everyone calls her Niecy) is African-American herself, but she wanted to serve ''the type of food that's eaten across the races.''</p>
        <p>''The misconception of Southern cooking,'' she went on, ''is that it's looked at as 'black food' or 'white food.' It's not. What we serve isn't African-American or Cajun or Caribbean. It's Southern.''</p>
        <p>Outside of fast-food places at highway rest stops, it's rare to find large numbers of black and white diners sitting side by side in the same restaurant. At Niecy's, it's gratifyingly standard.</p>
        <p>And the diversity isn't merely racial. At various times at various tables, I saw a nine-member extended family, ages 2 to 80, in dining-out clothes; a priest sharing a meal with a young man in shorts; a dot-com couple wearing dot-com T-shirts; and three beefy Essex County sheriff's officers in full regalia, complete with police radios.</p>
        <p>The welcome begins the moment you enter, with an ingenious touch that was born out of necessity. Because the building code limited the number of seats in Niecy's large, blocky storefront, Ms. Hampton found herself with unused space. So she turned the front of the restaurant into a sort of drawing room, a pleasant blue space with couches and flowers where diners can repair with drinks (you bring your own wine or beer) before or after dinner.</p>
        <p>The food is welcoming too, not ambitious but gently priced and genuinely comforting. Meals begin with a basket of cornbread or sweet-potato bread (or, if you're lucky, a combination), obviously just baked. While the sweet-potato bread may strike you as a bit too sweet, it's hard to put aside; maybe you just want to invest $3 in a bag to take home for breakfast.</p>
        <p>Among the appetizers, there are two standouts. Buffalo wings are crisp and meaty, and they gain heat, depth and smoke from Ms. Hampton superb Cajun sauce.</p>
        <p>And catfish fritters are so greaseless that our table had a bet going that they weren't fried but baked. (We lost. Ms. Hampton, who minored in nutrition at the late Upsala College in East Orange, relentlessly promotes healthy eating -- not an easy objective at this kind of restaurant -- and says she changes her frying oil obsessively.) When the slices of breaded catfish hit the hot oil, they twist into crazy shapes, edible bow ties and Mobius strips: just the thing with a little tartar sauce. I'd skip the salmon croquettes, which are salty and heavy, and the crab cakes, which at $8.25 are expensive and merely ordinary.</p>
        <p>Of course, since all the main courses come with two side dishes, Southern fashion, you may want to go easy on the appetizers in any event. And be careful when you order those sides. ''Gentlemen come in here,'' said Ms. Hampton, ''and they all order two starches. The lady will always order the balanced meal. The customer will try his two starches, I'll give him that look, and he'll say, 'Oh, all right, cross out the mashed potatoes and give me the collard greens.'''</p>
        <p>Oh, all right. But how about collard greens and mashed potatoes? The greens are terrific, sweet-sour and rich despite the absence of bacon fat. The potatoes have just the right blend of creaminess and lumpiness. Other good options are black-eyed peas, maple-syrup-scented yams and green beans, fresh and crunchy if hardly al dente.</p>
        <p>Cajun shrimp scampi, the most refined and expensive main course (at $17.50), is also one of the best: seven large shrimp, perhaps cooked half a minute too long, in a garlic-parsley sauce that somehow gets along perfectly with that Cajun sauce. Equally satisfying, at the other end of the price-and-refinement spectrum, is meat loaf made with lean beef ($9.50), moist and fragrant with onions, peppers and Italian herbs.</p>
        <p>Some barbecued dishes, including salmon and chicken, are tasty enough but tend to dry out from overcooking. Barbecued ribs, on the other hand, are splendidly meaty, tender and spicy, and they were even better the next night, when we finished the portion we'd taken home. The only main course to avoid altogether is the pork chop stuffed with soggy cornbread, smothered in a viscous brown sauce and tasting straight off a hospital cart.</p>
        <p>Desserts struck me as unnecessary, considering the abundance of the rest of the meal. Still, a couple of bites of lemon pound cake and sweet-potato pie convinced me that they were in keeping with Ms. Hampton's overall philosophy of wholesomeness, freshness and authenticity. Her hard work and vision are paying off in a restaurant that fits as comfortably into its landscape as any I've ever visited.</p>
