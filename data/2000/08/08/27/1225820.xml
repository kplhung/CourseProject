        <p>As some Security Council members, led by Russia and the United States, move toward increasing sanctions on the militant Islamic government of Afghanistan, a report by the United Nations' relief coordinator there says that the existing economic embargo is having ''a tangible negative effect'' on efforts to help the Afghan people.</p>
        <p>A survey in mid-August by relief officials found that sanctions imposed in 1999 are stifling what international trade was left in a country still shattered by more than 20 years of civil war, severe drought and the frequently self-defeating economic strictures of the Taliban, the strict Islamic movement that seized power four years ago.</p>

        <p>As some Security Council members, led by Russia and the United States, move toward increasing sanctions on the militant Islamic government of Afghanistan, a report by the United Nations' relief coordinator there says that the existing economic embargo is having ''a tangible negative effect'' on efforts to help the Afghan people.</p>
        <p>A survey in mid-August by relief officials found that sanctions imposed in 1999 are stifling what international trade was left in a country still shattered by more than 20 years of civil war, severe drought and the frequently self-defeating economic strictures of the Taliban, the strict Islamic movement that seized power four years ago.</p>
        <p>The embargo is also further isolating Afghans and making it more difficult for the outside world to deal with their leaders, the report found.</p>
        <p>The findings, issued this week in New York, have added to a debate about the unintended consequences of embargoes in the Security Council, which has ordered a study on the effects of sanctions and open-ended embargoes as a policy tool.</p>
        <p>Sanctions were imposed on the Taliban largely at the behest of the United States, which wants Afghanistan to hand over Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born financier who lives in Afghanistan and has been accused of financing international terrorism.</p>
        <p>Russia, which fears the spread of Islamic militancy on its southern borders, and Iran, which supports a faction of the armed opposition, have called for even harsher measures. An embargo on arms sales is being discussed.</p>
        <p>United Nations officials and Afghans agree that an arms embargo will have widespread support among the Afghan population, which has seen arms flow in from Pakistan, Iran, Central Asia and Russia, diplomats said.</p>
        <p>In human terms, the report said, ''A significant impact of sanctions is the extent to which ordinary Afghans feel isolated and victimized.''</p>
