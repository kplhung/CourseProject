        <p>In a 5-2 ruling last week, Georgia's Supreme Court stayed the execution of Alexander Williams, a mentally ill death row inmate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams would have been the fifth immate executed in the United States this year who committed his crime as a minor - the highest number in one year since 1954. He was convicted of murdering 16-year-old Aleta Bunch, whom he had seized in a shopping mall in Augusta, Ga., when he was 17. Mr. Williams, now 32, is among 80 young offenders who are now on death row. All are male, 43 percent are black, 37 percent are white and 20 percent are Hispanic.</p>
        <p>The delay followed  an appeal by lawyers for Mr. Williams, who argued that the execution of an individual who was under 18 at the time of the crime is cruel and unusual punishment. They also argued that executing offenders for juvenile violent crime is a violation of an international human rights treaty that the United States has signed.</p>
        <p>Of the 23 states that have permitted executions of young offenders since 1978, only seven have carried out the punishment. Here are details of the four such executions performed this year, and the age at which an offender can be executed by state.</p>
