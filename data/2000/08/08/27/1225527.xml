        <p>Excerpt from ''Wishing My Father Well,'' by William Plummer.</p>
        <p>When I finished talking long distance with my sister, I went back to the bedroom and got in with Nick. I put my arms around him and pulled him close. I told him that his grandfather, whom he called Deggie, had had a heart attack while fishing and just sat back on the bank and expired.</p>
        <p>I started to mouth the sentiment that would become a mantra with my parents' friends -- that Dad's death could not have been better scripted by the movies, that he died with his boots on, doing the thing he loved best.</p>
        <p>But Nicky cut right through the B.S.</p>
        <p>''Was Deggie all alone?'' Nicky asked.</p>
        <p>''I don't know,'' I said. Then, with a shudder: ''Yes, I think he was. I think you always are.''</p>
