        <p>The gym doors opened for a Tuesday scrimmage between the pros who make up the United States Olympic men's basketball team and a group of American college players who were selected to prep them for the Sydney Games. Two distinct sounds emerged from the Lahaina Civic Center: rubber squeaking against hardwood and Gary Payton's incessant jawing.</p>
        <p>As several Team USA officials laughed nervously, Payton verbally abused Duke's Jason Williams and other USA Select players who caught his glance. Biting, creative and always obliterating the etiquette line, the Seattle point guard seems to have all the potential to spark an international incident next month in Australia.</p>

        <p>The gym doors opened for a Tuesday scrimmage between the pros who make up the United States Olympic men's basketball team and a group of American college players who were selected to prep them for the Sydney Games. Two distinct sounds emerged from the Lahaina Civic Center: rubber squeaking against hardwood and Gary Payton's incessant jawing.</p>
        <p>As several Team USA officials laughed nervously, Payton verbally abused Duke's Jason Williams and other USA Select players who caught his glance. Biting, creative and always obliterating the etiquette line, the Seattle point guard seems to have all the potential to spark an international incident next month in Australia.</p>
        <p>As Payton's sneaker company once boasted: ''You don't win silver. You lose gold.''</p>
        <p>But not to worry, Commissioner Stern. It was all for show.</p>
        <p>''I'm not going to talk like that in Sydney,'' Payton said. ''We're just going to do our job. This is just a little fun because we're out here right now.''</p>
        <p>There is little similarity between this group of Olympians and the National Basketball Association players who represented the United States in the 1990's -- the Magic-Bird-Jordan triumvirate in '92 and the Shaq-Penny-Scottie threesome in '96.</p>
        <p>Six of arguably the top 10 players in the world are not here. Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant declined invitations. Tim Duncan and Grant Hill bowed out with injuries. Karl Malone, who played in the past two Olympics, and Chris Webber, the most dynamic power forward in the game, were never extended formal invitations.</p>
        <p>No one would admit it, but image concerns killed the hopes of Allen Iverson and Latrell Sprewell. What's more, Larry Brown was named as an assistant coach. The thinking was that Iverson and Brown have the whole N.B.A. season to work out their problems in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>So that leaves players like Vin Baker and Antonio McDyess, Steve Smith and Shareef Abdur-Rahim -- fine talents but not exactly the players primarily responsible for selling the league over the next decade. Vince Carter, the player with the most star power along with Kevin Garnett, was not originally invited.</p>
        <p>Still, there is an attitude attached to this group that is almost collegial. They go at each other on the floor, on the team bus, on the golf course and at the poolside bar.</p>
        <p>Payton and Garnett literally talk up a storm. They talk about other players. They talk about teammates. They talk about referees. ''We talk about everything and everybody,'' Payton said. ''Nothing is off limits. When we played each other. What people are wearing. We started calling McDyess 'Him,' 'cause he was so quiet, we couldn't even get his name out of him. So we just started calling him 'Him.' ''</p>
        <p>In 1996, as the Americans rolled to the gold medal, the undertone of their camaraderie was all about dollars. O'Neal held a news conference the day the Atlanta Games began to announce that he was leaving Orlando for Hollywood and $120 million. Reggie Miller was so preoccupied with his contract that he rushed down the hall to Hill's hotel room and yelled: ''Your boy just ruined my leverage! I can't believe it.'' Allan Houston had signed a seven-year deal with the Knicks, killing the possibility that New York would offer Miller a contract, thus making Indiana pay more for Miller's services.</p>
        <p>The only blip on the screen here has been Tim Hardaway wondering if Pat Riley really, truly cares about him -- enough to give a 34-year-old, loyal warhorse, oh, about $10 million annually. Or Carter expressing hurt feelings over the latest breakup of an N.B.A. superstar tandem. Tracy McGrady, his closest friend and teammate, left for Orlando and more money. He said recently that he was not as emotionally tethered to Carter as people thought. ''I guess I just read too much into that relationship,'' Carter said.</p>
        <p>Yes, they run around the court sometimes as if it is an All-Star Game, as if they don't know whether to play basketball, put on a show or both. Such is the curse of the world Michael Jordan created. They not only have to win but they also have to look good.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, after Notre Dame's Troy Murphy threw down an alley-oop dunk on one end, Payton yelled: ''That's all right. They're allowed to get a basket every once in a while.''</p>
        <p>He wondered aloud if the college players had subscribed to cable television and seen some of his peers.</p>
        <p>On the other end, Garnett rebounded a miss and dunked it back tremendously hard. He hung on the rim and used Murphy's shoulders for a seat while he pirouetted and finally released his fingers -- about the same time he let out a primal scream.</p>
        <p>The United States is 40-0 since allowing N.B.A. players to compete in the Olympics. The average margin of victory for one of the teams was 43 points. As Payton, Garnett and friends are learning, walking that line between publicly embarrassing someone and having genuine fun at an opponent's expense is always rough when you are this good.</p>
