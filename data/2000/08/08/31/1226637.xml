        <p>A federal judge rejected an online music start-up's argument yesterday that the Universal Music Group is improperly pursuing a copyright infringement claim against the company as a means of driving a potential competitor out of business.</p>
        <p>During testimony by Edgar M. Bronfman Jr., the co-chairman of Universal's parent, the Seagram Company, Judge Jed S. Rakoff of Federal District Court in Manhattan ruled as irrelevant MP3.com's contention that Universal would not settle the suit because of its own online strategy.</p>
        <p>At issue in the trial is whether MP3.com willfully disregarded copyright law when it created an online database that included about 5,000 of the Universal recordings. Judge Rakoff ruled in April that MP3.com had violated copyrights held by the five major record labels with the creation of a service called My.MP3.com. All the companies except Universal have since reached settlements with MP3.com that allow their music to be used in the service for an undisclosed sum. The other companies are Sony Music, Time Warner, the EMI Group and Bertelsmann A.G.</p>
        <p>If the judge finds that MP3.com willfully violated the law, he could set damages as high as $150,000 per compact disc. If he finds that the violation was not willful, damages could be as low as $200.</p>
        <p>My.MP3.com allowed users to store music centrally on MP3.com's computers and get access to it through devices like portable music players and personal computers. Rather than requiring users to load their own music into an online locker, which can be a time-consuming process, My.MP3.com allowed them to simply insert a CD into the CD-ROM drive of a computer. Once MP3.com's software verified that the person had possession of a CD, the company gave the user access to the music stored on its own computers.</p>
        <p>MP3.com in May suspended the My.MP3.com service, which it said had roughly 500,000 participants and about 80,000 CD's.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, MP3.com called Mr. Bronfman as a hostile witness and tried to use his testimony to suggest that Universal had an anticompetitive motive for refusing settlement. Michael Carlinsky, one of MP3.com's lawyers, asked Mr. Bronfman about remarks he had made comparing MP3.com to Jimmy and Doug's Farmclub, a Web site for unsigned artists that Universal started last year.</p>
        <p>''Did MP3.com's market valuation bother you?'' Mr. Carlinsky asked.</p>
        <p>''No, it excited me,'' Mr. Bronfman replied.</p>
        <p>Mr. Carlinsky also asked Mr. Bronfman about a speech in which he described the My.MP3.com service along with two other Web music sites, Napster and Gnutella, as ''exemplars of theft, of piracy, of the illegal and willful appropriation of someone else's property.''</p>
        <p>''Do you think there was a willful disregard for the law?'' Mr. Carlinksy asked.</p>
        <p>''If you're asking me do I think someone accidentally purchased 80,000 CD's,'' Mr. Bronfman replied.</p>
        <p>But after about an hour of back-and-forth, Judge Rakoff dismissed Mr. Bronfman, calling the question of motive irrelevant.</p>
        <p>''No one is obliged to settle a lawsuit,'' he said, adding that he would not allow ''a misuse of a court proceeding for the airing of hard feelings that understandably exist between the defendant and the remaining plaintiffs.''</p>
        <p>Still, after hearing testimony from two senior MP3.com executives, the judge offered what appeared to be a more favorable view of MP3.com's actions yesterday than he has held in the past.</p>
        <p>''One wonders if the case doesn't come down to whether the plaintiff's proof of willfulness is sufficient to carry its burden,'' Judge Rakoff said, noting that MP3.com witnesses had said that they consulted with outside lawyers about the creation of the online database.</p>
        <p>Asserting lawyer-client privilege, MP3.com has declined to disclose what the advice of its outside counsel was. Lawyers for Universal have argued that the judge should draw a negative inference from that lack of disclosure, since if the company ignored legal warnings about My.MP3.com, that would in itself constitute willful disregard for the law.</p>
        <p>But MP3.com's lawyers cite a legal precedent that states that courts are not entitled to draw such an inference because waiving lawyer-client privilege opens the door to other inquiries that could put a defendant at risk.</p>
        <p>Marci Hamilton, a visiting professor at the New York School of Law who specializes in copyrights, said the judge would no doubt weigh other factors as well.</p>
