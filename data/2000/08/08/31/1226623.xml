        <p>A federal lawsuit filed yesterday charges that the city's Administration for Children's Services violated the civil rights of a 5-year-old boy and his mother by holding the child in foster care illegally for two and a half years and denying his mother the chance to plead in court for his return.</p>
        <p>Though the suit, brought by the national advocacy agency Children's Rights, seeks monetary damages only on behalf of that family, it cites city figures showing that last year 2,525 children were being held in foster care without legal authority because caseworkers and city lawyers had failed to take their cases back to Family Court for review as required by law, usually annually.</p>

        <p>A federal lawsuit filed yesterday charges that the city's Administration for Children's Services violated the civil rights of a 5-year-old boy and his mother by holding the child in foster care illegally for two and a half years and denying his mother the chance to plead in court for his return.</p>
        <p>Though the suit, brought by the national advocacy agency Children's Rights, seeks monetary damages only on behalf of that family, it cites city figures showing that last year 2,525 children were being held in foster care without legal authority because caseworkers and city lawyers had failed to take their cases back to Family Court for review as required by law, usually annually.</p>
        <p>Jack Deacy, a spokesman for the Administration for Children's Services, said that city lawyers had not yet seen the lawsuit and that he could not comment on it. Earlier this year, a report by the administration cited the number of children in legally expired placements as an improvement, noting that more than 10,770 children had been in such placements in January 1997.</p>
        <p>Agency officials have characterized the status of those children as a paperwork problem with only fiscal consequences. But advocates for parents and children say the case of the child and his mother, known in the lawsuit by the pseudonyms Jeremy M. and Joanne M., illustrates that so-called lapsed placements are part of a pattern of agency behavior that hurts children and families.</p>
        <p>''He thought everybody was his mother because he had so many of them,'' the mother said in a recent interview in the Brooklyn apartment where her son finally came home to her and his baby sister last December. He arrived with only the clothes on his back, she said, and symptoms of abuse from at least one of the three foster homes he had been shuttled through.</p>
        <p>The boy's mother does not dispute the city's decision to take him into custody shortly after his birth on Jan. 24, 1995. At 34, she was homeless and on drugs, she said, still struggling to overcome the effects of her own damaging odyssey through the child welfare system in the 1970's. ''I needed help,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But all along, records show, the official plan was to return the boy to her care. She was so determined to win her son back, she said, that she trudged 38 blocks from the shelter to the hospital for daily visits after her discharge, quit drugs in a residential treatment program where the baby could have joined her, completed parenting classes and job training, and eventually secured an apartment.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit charges that even after the city's right to hold the boy expired in July 1997, it illegally kept him from her for two and a half more years, causing physical injury to the boy and severe emotional and psychological damage to them both. The suit seeks damages of $3 million for the boy and $1.5 million for his mother.</p>
        <p>In one of the worst episodes, the mother said, the system seemed to have lost her son entirely. Learning almost by chance that caseworkers had abruptly transferred him from one of its 63 contract agencies to another after allegations of sexual abuse in his foster home, she went from agency to agency, trying to locate him and to find out what had happened.</p>
        <p>At the fourth place, in desperation, she said, she simply refused to leave the premises until caseworkers figured out where the boy was.</p>
        <p>Ira Lustbader, a lawyer with Children's Rights representing the boy, said it turned out that the child had been taken into custody under the wrong last name and birth date and placed with Seamen's Society for Children and Families.</p>
        <p>Seamen's Society, a nonprofit contract agency that is also a defendant in the lawsuit, did not return calls for comment yesterday. But records show that it put the boy in two more foster homes in succession, while restricting his mother's visits to the legal minimum: one hour every other week at the agency's office in downtown Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>''Without the pressure of the case being taken back to court, agencies often don't make a decision either to work toward adoption or to work toward return to parents,'' said Linda Holmes, a lawyer with Brooklyn Legal Services who petitioned the court for weekend visits on the mother's behalf. ''I've had agency attorneys say to me that basically all children are on an adoption track. There's this unspoken assumption against parents, so a parent really has to swim against the tide.''</p>
        <p>The boy's mother did. As most agencies require, she had signed a contract listing all the expectations she would have to meet to win the return of her son. She had met them all, she said, besides proving herself a good mother to a baby daughter born drug free in October 1998.</p>
        <p>But whenever she pressed for her son's return and asked when she would have her day in court, she said, agency officials told her she had just missed the court hearing.</p>
        <p>In 1999, she said, agency officials told her she would have to wait even longer: her son, then 4, was showing signs of behavioral disturbance and needed continued foster care, they said.</p>
        <p>''That's when I told them, 'I'm calling Children's Rights and I'm going to sue you,' '' she recalled.</p>
        <p>The lawyer she appealed to, Marcia Robinson Lowry, now directs Children's Rights. But more than two decades earlier, she had represented the woman, who was then a child, as one of the plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit that forced the city to bring home children placed in for-profit institutions in other states. Her institution in Florida became notorious after its squalid conditions were exposed on ''60 Minutes.''</p>
        <p>When Ms. Lowry and Mr. Lustbader intervened on the boy's behalf, the woman said, she finally learned that his placement was not legal. But, the lawsuit charges, a city lawyer told her that if she pressed for immediate custody of her son, ''she risked being subjected to a new neglect petition, which could result in her loss of the custody of her then 11-month-old daughter.''</p>
        <p>Still, she refused to consent, confident that she had done nothing to jeopardize her custody of her daughter, and the city ''subsequently acknowledged it had no basis for a new neglect petition,'' the lawsuit said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lustbader said shuffling the boy from home to home was harmful to him. The lawsuit contends that he showed evidence of abuse, slashing the floor with a belt, for example, while yelling, ''Bad Jeremy!''</p>
        <p>''As the child's lawyer, my concern is what is the damage to this little boy, and to all the thousands of other kids who this is happening to,'' Mr. Lustbader said. ''And who's minding the store?''</p>
        <p>Nine months after his reunion with his mother, the boy seems at ease in her embrace. He led a visitor down the hall to his sunny bedroom, where his artwork is proudly pasted on the walls and his favorite Dr. Seuss, ''Green Eggs and Ham,'' is in a pile of books on the windowsill. He did not want to talk much about the past.</p>
        <p>''I was living with somebody else,'' he confided. ''I wanted to go see my mom.''</p>
