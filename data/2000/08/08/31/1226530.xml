        <p>IT has been a banner season for slobs. As the nation spent the summer watching those telegenic survivors turn desert-island filth into high ratings, researchers in the United States and in England told a different kind of dirty story: a little squalor may be good for the health. Common household germs and dust, it seems, play a vital role in the development of immune systems. In housekeeping terms, this is the equivalent of discovering that chocolate bonbons cure varicose veins.</p>
        <p>All of this may come as a surprise to those who watched Cheryl Mendelson's manual, ''Home Comforts: The Art and Science of Keeping House'' (Scribner, $35), rise up best-seller lists last year. Riding a drift in the national mood, Ms. Mendelson raised a crisply ironed flag for a holy mission against disorder. Even the neatest of us, she proposed, lives but one step removed from ''the oppression of dirt, with its associations of death, discomfort, shame and danger.'' Wielded with due rigor, the Electrolux becomes not just a modern convenience but a weapon in a moral crusade.</p>
        <p>Now, a handful of studies indicate that this crusade may have gone too far. Though the evidence is still preliminary, researchers believe our progress in domestic hygiene may be at least partly responsible for increased rates of asthma, eczema, hay fever and allergies, and that it may open the avenue for the emergence of new germs.</p>
        <p>''We are changing the bacteria that we've adapted to over millions of years,'' said Dr. Stuart Levy, director of the Center for Adaptation Genetics and Drug Resistance at Tufts University School of Medicine. The results of this tinkering, he said, are ominous.</p>
        <p>Even a clean room -- that holy grail of parenting -- is overrated, said Robert Billingham, a professor of human development and family studies at Indiana University.</p>
        <p>''Parents have bought into the idea that if I don't teach my kid to be clean and organized, I'm not a good parent,'' said Mr. Billingham, who admitted to not being terribly neat. ''But there isn't any research that shows messy children are any less healthy or successful or happy than orderly ones.''</p>
        <p>Researchers at the University of Arizona reported last week in The New England Journal of Medicine that children who were exposed early to common household germs and infections were less likely to develop asthma and wheezing by the time they turned 6. Forget about protecting kids from germs: those who had older siblings or attended day care before the age of 6 months -- both prime sources of filth and infection -- were healthier than the ones who did not.</p>
        <p>The results offered the latest round of support for what has been called the ''hygiene hypothesis,'' a growing contention that we don't have enough dirt and germs in our lives. In the 1980's, researchers sought to explain why asthma and allergies were growing at striking rates in some parts of the world, including the United States, while pottering along in others. The most obvious explanation was that pollutants in industrial societies were making people sick.</p>
        <p>But then a string of studies found an unexpected pattern: more highly polluted cities in places like the former East Germany and industrial China actually had lower rates of asthma than their cleaner counterparts in West Germany or Hong Kong. The explanation, clearly, lay elsewhere.</p>
        <p>''What we're finding is that childhood exposure to infections and certain environmental toxins seems to have a protective effect,'' said Dr. Andrew Liu, a pediatric asthma specialist at the National Jewish Medical and Research Center in Denver. In dirtier cities, the children grew up around high levels of toxins, and their immune systems developed the right defensive responses; in cleaner cities, those growing up in meticulously tidy homes were less likely to develop defenses against the toxins -- and by extension, more likely to develop asthma.</p>
        <p>Dr. Liu and a team of researchers in Denver found that early exposure to ordinary house dust appears to reduce young children's chances of developing asthma. The researchers surmised that the children developed an immune response to common bacterial components called endotoxins, which are found in dust and around many animals. ''The immune system learns much like our brain learns,'' Dr. Liu said. ''There's a tremendous amount of learning in the early years. It's also possible that there's a critical period for learning an immune response, and that you may have difficulty catching up later.'' He cautioned, however, that if someone already has asthma, dust will only make it worse.</p>
        <p>Some researchers further speculate that, with too few germs or allergens to attack, the immune system turns on the body's own cells. But the studies of this autoimmune response have been mixed, Dr. Liu said.</p>
        <p>Even more risky than the overzealous broom are the armies of antibacterial products waiting to invade the kitchen, Dr. Levy of Tufts said. A recent survey conducted for the Infectious Diseases Society of America found that nearly half of all soaps on the market now contain antibacterial agents.</p>
        <p>''Why does Windex need an antibacterial in it?'' he asked. ''It already has alcohol.'' At best, Dr. Levy said, these products are ineffective. But even if one did work when first applied, as its level of concentration dropped, bacteria could produce strains that resist it. Earlier this summer, in response to this threat, the American Medical Association suggested government regulation for antibacterial products. Regular soap and water, Dr. Levy said, are the best defense against germs.</p>
        <p>The war against mess, like other passions of the home, has long had a social and moral dimension. In America, after all, ''the great unwashed'' bear a deep social stigma. At the turn of the last century, keeping a clean home was a ritual not just of hygiene, but of assimilation, said Suellen Hoy, a historian and the author of ''Chasing Dirt: The American Pursuit of Cleanliness'' (Oxford, 1995). ''It was how you showed you were eager to be an American,'' Ms. Hoy said. Though early pioneers had to establish basic levels of hygiene to survive, cleanliness quickly evolved into a mark of status and social mobility -- not next to godliness, as the Methodist leader John Wesley preached, but next to worldly success. Poor families in the South swept their dirt floors; immigrants in New York scrubbed tenement stoops to hospital levels of cleanliness.</p>
        <p>Long before Martha Stewart arrived on the scene, tidy rooms and spotless floors became landmarks in the American mythology. ''You were cleaning up and moving up,'' Ms. Hoy said. ''For a country that has a hard time coming together on anything, we certainly do on cleanliness.''</p>
        <p>This is a tradition that never dies. This year, Ace Hardware ran a contest soliciting photographs of America's messiest room. They are portraits of the abyss, the quagmire from which civilization nonetheless continues to arise.</p>
        <p>The current attack on germs also continues a history, said Nancy Tomes, a professor of history at the State University of New York at Stony Brook and the author of ''The Gospel of Germs: Men, Women and the Microbe in American Life'' (Harvard, 1998). The last germ panic, as she calls it, took shape in the 1900's. Then, as now, the anxieties about germs rose during a period of increased immigration and travel.</p>
        <p>''All of a sudden in the early 20th century, people far away from you were making your clothes,'' she said. ''The movement to regulate sweatshops arose from a fear of germs from all these immigrant workers. With the railroads and subways, people started to travel among people they didn't know, and whose cleanliness habits were unknown.'' The current germ mania, she said, began with the outbreak of AIDS, but has grown beyond the limits of reason. ''I understand the anxieties about emerging viruses,'' she said. ''But there's nothing in the science of public health to back up those fears.''</p>
        <p>In the end, the struggle for a clean home is a quest not just for hygiene, but for control. If we cannot control the decline of civilization in global politics or at the multiplex, at least we can oppress the dirt in the foyer. In this battle, the control freaks may have pushed their advantage too far, opening the door for new levels of chaos and squalor. Sloth may appear lazy, but it never stays down that long.</p>
