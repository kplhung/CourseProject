        <p>IT isn't easy to find the Queens Botanical Garden, unless you live on Main Street in Flushing, or down one of those little one-way streets like Dahlia or Blossom. The 39-acre garden, with its campy, low-slung buildings and boisterous plantings, is tucked into the northeastern corner of Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, cinched in by a pretzel of highways: the Grand Central Parkway, the Van Wyck Expressway, the Long Island Expressway. One wrong turn, and you're heading for the Whitestone Bridge, an 18-wheeler on your rear bumper. (You can always take the No. 7 train to the end of the line, and walk eight blocks.)</p>
        <p>This garden, which was seized by the city eight years ago when its director and 20 members of its board were removed for misuse of funds and negligence, is experiencing a rebirth that can only be described as joyful. ''We want to be a botanic garden for cultural diversity and education,'' said Susan Lacerte, the garden's executive director. She was appointed six years ago by the board of the Queens Botanical Garden Society, which regained control of the garden in 1993 and has new corporate connections and a bent for fund-raising. ''There are plenty of other botanic gardens doing scientific research,'' she continued. ''Our research is cultural research, how people use plants around the world.''</p>

        <p>IT isn't easy to find the Queens Botanical Garden, unless you live on Main Street in Flushing, or down one of those little one-way streets like Dahlia or Blossom. The 39-acre garden, with its campy, low-slung buildings and boisterous plantings, is tucked into the northeastern corner of Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, cinched in by a pretzel of highways: the Grand Central Parkway, the Van Wyck Expressway, the Long Island Expressway. One wrong turn, and you're heading for the Whitestone Bridge, an 18-wheeler on your rear bumper. (You can always take the No. 7 train to the end of the line, and walk eight blocks.)</p>
        <p>This garden, which was seized by the city eight years ago when its director and 20 members of its board were removed for misuse of funds and negligence, is experiencing a rebirth that can only be described as joyful. ''We want to be a botanic garden for cultural diversity and education,'' said Susan Lacerte, the garden's executive director. She was appointed six years ago by the board of the Queens Botanical Garden Society, which regained control of the garden in 1993 and has new corporate connections and a bent for fund-raising. ''There are plenty of other botanic gardens doing scientific research,'' she continued. ''Our research is cultural research, how people use plants around the world.''</p>
        <p>The Queens Botanical Garden welcomes just about anyone with a passion: a Russian opera singer who manages the beehives, a meteorologist in love with composting. Bird walkers. (''Baby! Baby! Baby!'' a Chinese woman cried one morning. Her bird had flown off its string.) And then there's tai chi, the ancient Chinese exercise that evolved from the martial arts centuries ago, practiced here from 7 to 9 every morning,  365 days a year.</p>
        <p>Just walk through the gate (no admission charge!), pass the garden shop in a Quonset hut and the composting office in a green-shingled trailer, and join the Happy Exercise Club ($5 for a life membership) under the allee of grand old oaks. It's like slipping into a quiet pond, moving arms and legs so deliberately they seem to be pushing water.</p>
        <p>''It's slow,'' said Raymond Chen, 70, as he followed the movements of Hansong Huang, the 82-year-old master, who leaned back, and then forward, impossibly balanced for a man his age. ''You've got to use concentration.'' As mist cleared over the European hornbeam, hovering like a green unisphere over a sea of giant hibiscus, men and women of all ages followed Master Huang through 24 movements with names like Parting the Horse's Mane, Grasping the Swallow's Tail and Clouds Roll By.</p>
        <p>Nearby, Korean gardeners tended their wild sesame and angelica, a Japanese woman weeded the soybeans she had planted from seeds sent from Kyoto, a Latino gardener picked the thick leaves of a ''Vicks'' plant (after Vicks VapoRub), started from a cutting he spirited out of Puerto Rico in his suitcase. An African-American man harvested leaves from his patch of collard greens, taking a leaf here, a leaf there, so as not to destroy the whole.</p>
        <p>The 1990 census made it clear that Queens was the most ethnically diverse county in the United States. Since then, immigrants have continued to stream into the borough. A botanical garden in such a setting must take a universal approach.</p>
        <p>''The key is moving all these groups into the garden,'' said David Quintas-Parquet, a Cuban-born, Miami-raised Verizon executive who lives in Forest Hills and serves on the board. ''Most mainstream institutions never make the point to reach out to these communities. But we're saying we have to, for moral as well as economic reasons.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Quintas-Parquet makes a point of coming to the garden for Latino outreach days, where he has been known to wax poetic about the tuberoses that grew in his mother's garden in Miami. ''They don't look like much, but they have a fragrance I will never forget.''</p>
        <p>More than 2,000 people, more than half of them Asian, came to Gardening Day in April 1997, when a local florist translated into Chinese a lecture by David and Kasha Furman on the Chinese tree peony, long a symbol of love and prosperity. In 1998, Gardening Day concentrated on Hispanic traditions.</p>
        <p>Korean gardeners planted their national flower, the Rose of Sharon, in a wide swath behind the Wedding Garden, booked for ceremonies in Hindi, Hebrew, Spanish, Korean, Pakistani and Chinese. (Garden regulars park their lawn chairs outside the gate and offer ruthless commentary on the best, ugliest, happiest or saddest bride.)</p>
        <p>When the city returned control to the Queens group, it had operated on a deficit for five years. ''When I took over in July 1994, the garden had $38,000 in the bank,'' said Ms. Lacerte, who has a degree in public administration and cut her teeth on finance as an intern in Councilman Peter F. Vallone's office. ''The garden uses that much money in two to three weeks. I couldn't meet the payrolls without help from the state.''</p>
        <p>The garden itself was a wreck. The demoralized staff had stopped weeding. The bathrooms weren't working. There were no supplies. ''No peat moss, no paper clips,'' Ms. Lacerte said. ''They didn't even have a Band-Aid. A public place with 300,000 visitors a year, and no Band-Aid?''</p>
        <p>She hired two supervisors to energize the garden crew and started steering the garden into the black. The board brainstormed ways to draw the area's diverse population through the gates. Community leaders and neighbors were invited to air their opinions, as master planners considered how to turn this former swamp into a cultural, and sustainable, landscape. The ambitious plan, which could cost from $50 million to $80 million, is in its preliminary stages, and could take 15 years to complete.</p>
        <p>''We just started securing the perimeter of the garden, which is a $3.3 million project,'' Ms. Lacerte said, adding that without a fence, plants are too easily vandalized. ''And we want to make water a unifying element of the garden,'' she said. ''A branch of the Flushing River is buried under here. We want to uncover it, and build a constructed wetlands.''</p>
        <p>The garden evolved out of a swamp that was filled in to build the 1939 World's Fair, which featured a five-acre horticultural extravaganza called ''Gardens on Parade.'' A group of Queens residents restored the gardens in 1948 and set up the Queens Botanical Garden Society. They were bumped from the site by the 1964 World's Fair, and moved to the northeast corner of Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, but they took three blue atlas cedars, survivors from 1939, with them.</p>
        <p>These elegant evergreens now stand rather incongruously over Victorian bedding schemes that flaunt 12,000 tulips in spring and ever-changing annuals circling a spiky cycad shrub. That's known as Bernie's Bed. Nobody can remember who Bernie was, but they plant it the way Bernie did, year after year.</p>
        <p>A fragrance garden, full of lilacs, clethra, viburnum, nicotiana and many other sweet bloomers, wages a questionable battle with the fumes of Main Street's nearby heavy traffic (master planners suggested this garden be moved). And the old fountain -- drained because so many homeless people bathed there -- is now full of summer bloomers like Indian Summer rudbeckia and 10-foot-tall purple ironweed.</p>
        <p>It's this very live-and-let-live theory of gardening that is so engaging when public gardens are usually so polished and manicured. Here, the atmosphere is as free as the admission. ''It's very folksy,'' Ms. Lacerte said. ''It's a welcoming place.</p>
        <p>''It's of the community, by the community, and we don't want to lose that.''</p>
        <p>The master plan, for example, drawn up by the landscape architects Susan Wisniewski and Jamie Crelly Purinton, urges a return to the native plants that would work well as part of a sustainable landscape. ''I think that's smart, but we can't be all native,'' Ms. Lacerte said. ''I don't think that's what we're all about.''</p>
        <p>But she loves the vision of returning natural water systems to the land. ''I could see a water wall in the new administration building,'' Ms. Lacerte said. The new greenhouse could include tanks of fish and plants that thrive on nitrates and purify water that can be recycled through the garden.</p>
        <p>And if anything, these master planners are trying to preserve, even cultivate, the garden's zany, anything-goes atmosphere.</p>
        <p>''The master planners observed we had interesting staff gardens that should be open to the public,'' Marianne Kristoff, the supervisor of gardens, said, leading the way through a maze of trellises built from scrap wood, branches and twigs. (They are open.) Here, melons are supported way off the ground, in little hammocks made of string. Garlic chives are buried in rich compost, to keep their stalks white and tender.</p>
        <p>Soaring over this global farm is a boxwood airplane, a whimsical salute to La Guardia and Kennedy Airports' deafening jets constantly crossing overhead. There's a train too, and a pouncing cat, and a hand with two fingers raised in the sign language for ''I love you,'' all made by Louis Quiles, who has tended the grounds for 15 years.</p>
        <p>''You couldn't make this stuff up if you tried,'' said Ms. Kristoff, who came here from the lavish sculpture gardens at PepsiCo's corporate headquarters in Purchase, N.Y. ''There, everything was planned. Here, you can say, 'Oh, that's a good idea,' and it happens.''</p>
        <p>The statue ''Jesus and St. John in the Corn Field,'' on loan from the Brooklyn Museum, stands in a bed of red begonias. ''I keep saying we should grow corn'' around it, Ms. Kristoff said, but her gardeners keep planting flowers.</p>
        <p>In a typical botanical garden, the suggestions from the supervisor of gardens might well be heeded. But this is no typical botanical garden, and there isn't really a botanical name for what is growing here.</p>
