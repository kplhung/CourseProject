        <p>Departure of Richard N Kaplan as president of CNN's US operations and revamping of its entire executive structure reflect network's failure to maintain ratings in face of increasing competition in cable news and the absence of the kinds of stories that have made CNN the network to turn to in times of crisis; CNN is expected to shift from the sophisticated, expensive and highly produced programming that Kaplan had hoped would lift ratings and toward a rougher, newsier feel and stories with a broader audience appeal; photos; graphs of ratings of CNN, CNBC, MSNBC and Fox News (M)</p>

        <p>In 1997, CNN, the 24-hour cable news channel, found itself at somewhat of a dead end.</p>
        <p>Its blanket coverage of the Persian Gulf war had already established it as the news outlet to turn to in times of crisis. But it was not the one to watch for general news when times were quiet.</p>
        <p>With the country well into a prolonged period of prosperity, and new cable news outlets being started by Fox and by NBC -- creating the threat of competition where there had been none before -- CNN's executives were looking for something that would make it the news outlet of record all of the time.</p>
        <p>So they hired Richard N. Kaplan, an ABC News producer widely regarded as gifted, in the hope that as the president of their United States operation, he would bring to CNN what the broadcast networks already had: highly produced news programming so compelling that millions of people would tune in regularly whether there was big news or not. Think ''Nightline'' and ''Prime Time Live'' on ABC, a unit of the Walt Disney Company.</p>
        <p>But in the three years that have passed, CNN's audience has shrunk to its lowest levels in at least a decade. And advertising revenues, while still increasing significantly thanks to a robust market, are not meeting expectations, executives said.</p>
        <p>Dual announcements yesterday that Mr. Kaplan was resigning from CNN and that its entire executive structure was being revamped were accompanied by admissions that the strategy had not worked and a sense in some quarters that the network had become too slick and sophisticated for its own good. The situation is of pressing concern as CNN finds itself in an increasingly competitive environment and must get in step with the new-media vision of its prospective corporate parent, America Online, which is acquiring Time Warner, which owns CNN.</p>
        <p>''It is important that CNN News group make major changes, which will better equip us to strengthen ourselves,'' said Tom Johnson, the CNN chairman and chief executive, ''and to become even more competitive in the Internet world.''</p>
        <p>But the question remains: where, exactly, does CNN go from here? Can it ever regain its status as a must-see network at a time when its franchise has been chipped away relentlessly -- among conservatives and avid followers of politics by the News Corporation's Fox News Channel; among the young, by MSNBC; and among the financial news audience, by the fast-rising CNBC?</p>
        <p>These are questions that have been consuming much of the CNN executives' time. In recent weeks, at meetings at the Four Seasons Hotel in Atlanta and other sites, the executives have been in sometimes tense discussions trying to analyze the network's failings and trying to figure out what can be done to draw viewers.</p>
        <p>Amid the fallout from yesterday's news, executives at CNN's Atlanta headquarters were sending somewhat mixed signals as to what needed to be done to turn things around at the network.</p>
        <p>There was wide agreement that the expensive and highly produced programming that Mr. Kaplan made his trademark at the network would not be in such abundance, that the network would go for somewhat of a rougher, newsier feel like the one that helped put it on the map in the first place.</p>
        <p>And, where Mr. Kaplan had tried to bring a higher level of sophistication to the network, one top-level manager said executives would like also to produce a greater number of stories with broader audience appeal, though he did not offer specifics. There was also an acknowledgment that the network needs more news stars, large personalities who will stand out above the din, help CNN distinguish itself and draw viewers -- echoing a refrain from before Mr. Kaplan's arrival there.</p>
        <p>In conversations with numerous CNN executives yesterday, there was a sense that the network had been slow-footed in adapting to the new environment, after being, for so long, the only major cable news provider.</p>
        <p>And they said they believed this led to one of their greater failings: not realizing that with all the new  competition, CNN needed to be more heavily promoted in other media.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kaplan -- whose fate was sealed Tuesday, when he was presented with a new CNN flow chart that did not include him -- said the lack of promotion was a key factor in the failure of his magazine-style programs, and, ultimately, in his downfall.</p>
        <p>Boasting a large presence both figuratively and physically -- he is towering with a booming voice -- Mr. Kaplan arrived at CNN with a reputation as an imposing figure in the broadcasting establishment.</p>
        <p>He brought in some of his former stars from ABC, like Willow Bay and Jeff Greenfield, as well as some producers. Some old guard CNN executives who were at the network from its start in 1980 and still saw themselves as television news renegades, took to calling Mr. Kaplan and his new hires ''the ABC mafia.''</p>
        <p>They predicted that his signature news magazine program, ''NewsStand,'' would not work on cable, where viewers tend to flip among channels and do not necessarily have patience for longer, in-depth stories. It has still not taken off with viewers. The program stumbled when its first episode, asserting that the United States military used nerve gas during the Vietnam War, had to be retracted.</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview from his office in Atlanta yesterday, Mr. Kaplan said he thought ''NewsStand,'' like all of CNN's programming, would have done better in the ratings if it had been better advertised to the public.</p>
        <p>''I think our problem is that, in an age when people are promoting the hell out of everything they do, for CNN to still do absolutely no promotion is wrong, and is debilitating, and I think they know that,'' Mr. Kaplan said.</p>
        <p>He noted that the network is now planning to make a major promotional push to raise audience awareness about its programs. ''I wish it was something that happened when I was here,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He said he expected that the merger between CNN's parent and AOL would help further promote the network.</p>
        <p>But AOL's appearance on the scene is said by top CNN executives to be the among the largest factors in Mr. Kaplan's forced resignation.</p>
        <p>With the expected federal approval of the merger approaching, executives at Turner Broadcasting Systems, a division of Time Warner, are clearly looking to get CNN in order before its leadership has to report formally to Robert W. Pittman, the AOL president.</p>
        <p>Ted Turner, the CNN founder who was considered to be its sometimes blindly loyal protector within Time Warner, has taken a diminished role with CNN, leaving it in the hands of Terence F. McGuirk, Turner Broadcasting's chief executive.</p>
        <p>It was Mr. McGuirk who started the organization changes at CNN. With those changes, all of CNN's domestic operations, including CNN/ U.S., report to Jim Walton, who was formerly the head of CNN's sports division. All international divisions report to Chris Cramer, formerly of the British Broadcasting Corporation.</p>
        <p>In an interview, Mr. McGuirk said the changes were made so that all of the CNN division managers would work together to share content, which, he said, would become more important as CNN becomes more of a converged network.</p>
        <p>Mr. McGuirk and Mr. Johnson -- whose own role is slightly diminished in the new structure, although Mr. McGuirk said Mr. Johnson had his full support -- say they think that as CNN's television ratings decline as it integrates with AOL, CNN's real future is in producing news for a variety of new platforms, including hand-held wireless devices and monitors on airplanes.</p>
        <p>''Part of the challenge is going to be to integrate our existing analog operations and to take that into an Internet platform and other platforms,'' Mr. McGuirk said. ''That can make us as dominant in those areas as we have been in the analog television platform.''</p>
        <p>Executives said they did not believe that Mr. Kaplan, who has strong opinions about how things should be managed, would work within that structure. They said they feared that he would not work well with his fellow executives and that he would not be willing to produce the sort of easily digestible news bits that Internet audiences seem to desire.</p>
        <p>They said he was particularly difficult at times during the recent meetings in which they discussed the network's future.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kaplan acknowledged that there had been some tough moments.</p>
        <p>About his forced departure, he said: ''They were doing what their responsibility was, which was to protect CNN. And this is what they wanted to do.'' About his reaction, he said, ''When you were a kid dating, and your girlfriend told you that she didn't love you anymore, you didn't argue and say 'Yes, you do.' ''</p>
        <p>He said he believed the team in place was well equipped to take the network into the future. ''It's a great network,'' he said. ''It's going to stay a great network, and I'm the guy out. I don't love being the guy out. But, hey, that's the game you play in the big leagues.''</p>
        <p>Analysts gave mixed reviews to the changes.</p>
        <p>''All of this is uncharted territory,'' said Tom Wolzien, a senior analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein. ''Just because you have a plan doesn't mean it's better than the old one.''</p>
