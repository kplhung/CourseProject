        <p>THERE was a time, not long ago, when football and computers had as much to do with each other as touchdowns and home runs.</p>
        <p>But the two are merging this weekend in the first live Webcast of a major college football game -- between the highly ranked University of Nebraska Cornhuskers and the unranked and unsung Spartans of San Jose State University.</p>
        <p>''It's a great opportunity to bring the game to people who otherwise couldn't watch it unless they were in the stadium,'' said Danny Greenberg, senior vice president of FoxSports.com, which is working with the University of Nebraska to provide the Webcast of the game that will be played Saturday at Memorial Stadium in Lincoln.</p>
        <p>Despite the popularity of the Cornhuskers, the game is not being televised. ''That probably has more to do with how they feel the game might turn out than the size of one of the schools,'' said Chris Anderson, sports information director at the University of Nebraska. ''We had been wanting to try this, and it was a unique opportunity to do it with the first game at home.''</p>
        <p>The Webcast will be available free, but it is recommended that potential viewers log on ahead of time to register and to download necessary programs, like RealPlayer. In conjunction with FoxSports.com, the University of Nebraska will be providing the game to Internet users at Huskers.com by using four cameras inside the stadium.</p>
        <p>FoxSports.com has produced five Webcasts of high school all-star football games this summer, and high school basketball games last season. Although audio broadcasts of college and professional sports are common on the Web, this is the first Division I college football game to be broadcast online with streaming video and audio.</p>
        <p>''Given that San Jose is in the heart of Silicon Valley, it seems appropriate to be part of something new, to be a pioneer in this particular venture,'' said Lawrence Fan, sports information director at San Jose State. The university will also provide a link from its site, www. sjsuspartans.com.</p>
        <p>The University of Nebraska has had audio play-by-play of its football games on the Internet for years. ''We found we have a huge following on the Internet already,'' Ms. Anderson said. ''In other nontelevised games we've had more than half a million people from 20 countries listening.''</p>
        <p>In addition to the video and play-by-play commentary, the site will provide real-time game statistics, chats and live polling, as well as a pregame show. Yet given the quality of streaming video, television broadcasts will probably remain the favorite for some time.</p>
        <p>''This is an experiment,'' Mr. Greenberg said. ''It's not meant to be what you see on your TV.'' He said viewers using a typical modem speed of about 56k would see jerky or jumpy movements, but that a higher speed connection would provide an experience closer to that of television.</p>
        <p>One difference with the Webcast is the starting time of the game, which was moved to 11:30 a.m. C.S.T. to avoid a conflict with televised broadcasts of other Big 12 games -- and with the opening of the Nebraska State Fair.</p>
