        <p>In the 1800's, when the Irish left for America, relatives bid them goodbye with a wake, a celebration normally held for the dead.</p>
        <p>The likelihood that the emigrants would come back was thought to be about the same as their chance of returning from the dead; in those days there were no quick trips back for Christmas, no phone cards and no digital video of the grandchildren.</p>
        <p>Such journeys now take hours instead of weeks, and telecommunications have reduced the distance between home and away. Most recently, the Internet has bridged the gap, so that expatriates can be more connected to home than ever before. Whether the new American residents are from Australia, France, India or almost anywhere else in the world, there is a Web site that ties them to families and alleviates the strange grief of unavailable junk food. (What? No Tim Tams?)</p>
        <p>Kate Juliff of Australia, an information technology manager who has lived in New York for seven years, started Australians Abroad (www.australiansabroad.com) in 1996 with Richard Rankin, to ''raise issues of relevance to expatriates, as well as provide stories of interest, resources and a cybermeeting place for Australians living overseas.'' The site has 600 regular users with 1,000 drop-ins a day from 50 countries.</p>
        <p>Australians Abroad features a message board, a chat room, a resources list with links to travel, immigration and international shipping sites, as well as columns written by Australians, including, ''Letter from New York'' and ''Musings from Melbourne.'' The  anecdotal columns, in which Australian slang is common, address issues facing many expatriates -- managing finances in Australia from overseas, obtaining credit in a foreign country, finding insurance.</p>
        <p>In one ''Letter from New York,'' Ms. Juliff wrote about the difficult experience of a parent's illness and eventual death while she was living overseas. Australians Abroad also has a search engine and database for Australian-related sites.</p>
        <p>Two sites, www.farsinet.com and www.iaol.com, also try to provide a cyberhome-away-from-home. FarsiNet, for the international Iranian and Persian community, gives weather forecasts for 50 cities in Iran, relevant news articles from The Associated Press and articles and resources on Iranian and Persian business, poetry, art, food, history and events (mostly in the United States). It has a chat forum for ''Foreign husbands of Iranian women,'' and an online translator converts any English word into Farsi script.</p>
        <p>The Indians Abroad Online offers users a residential or business dial-up service, free e-mail messaging, home pages, horoscopes, greeting cards (''Happy Love at First Sight Day''), audio music files, a chat room and encyclopedic information on Indian dining, fashion, immigration, science and technology, and ''Bollywood'' (the Indian film industry). The Matrimonials section allows users to find a mate by specifying traits like age, immigration status, religion or caste.</p>
        <p>Some sites bring expatriates together based on country of residence rather than country of origin.</p>
        <p>Al Nevarez was working in Japan, first for the Ford Motor Company and then Visteon Corporation, when he started jotting down notes about his favorite restaurants in his Palm Pilot. As Mr. Nevarez watched other Americans doing the same, he decided to develop a P.D.A. and Web tool to bring ''peace of mind to expatriates in an environment where there is little English.''</p>
        <p>Now, Mr. Nevarez said, 300 users download the site (www.japaninyourpalm.com) to their P.D.A.'s everyday, and in July, there were 130,000 hits. He also offers an i-mode mobile Internet cell version of the site.</p>
        <p>JapanInYourPalm.com features restaurant reviews and resources organized into topics like sports, nightlife, health, family and church, as well as train schedules and restaurant menus in English.</p>
        <p>''Living overseas brings a unique appreciation for the power of the Internet,'' said Mr. Nevarez, who returned to the United States in July but, with contributions from friends still in Japan, updates the site daily.</p>
        <p>Other location specific sites include www.expatsingapore.com, which claims 20,000 users a month and more than one million users overall, and , a site for foreigners (www.expatvillage.com) in Buenos Aires that went online in mid-April. The sites carry weather information, features on culture, travel, dining, immigration and advertisements. Advertisements in Expatvillage.com offer everything from ''Focused Psychotherapy in Spanish, English or French'' to ''European home appliances repair.''</p>
        <p>Another site (www .expataccess.com) is based on both nationality and location with a focus on people who are moving abroad. Having a baby in France, Spain, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands or Britain is just one of the many detailed topics. The site also has sections for American or British residents who are moving to continental Europe, offering tips like how to import a car. Similar in scope is www .peoplegoingglobal .com, which covers every continent and is dense with country-specific governmental and economic information and related links.</p>
        <p>Betsy Burlingame, who once lived in Germany, started www.expatexchange.com as a master's thesis project at New York University. The site, which went online in 1997, has 4 employees and more than 100 volunteers. It joins with companies in a ''General Store'' to tailor products and services for members, like Medibroker International, a medical and health insurance broker that is run by expatriates.</p>
        <p>Expat Exchange has information for nonmembers and private forums for members  (registration is free). The forums are divided into categories including ''women's,'' ''men's,'' ''spouse's'' and ''GenXpat'' (young professionals), as well as jobs, books and travel. The site has 8,000 members from more than 60 nations and 18,000 monthly visitors, and it seeks to create a community for expatriates in all countries. Country specific forums feature stories like the eight-part diary of Lexie, an American cat, and her journey through the rigorous Australian quarantine process.</p>
        <p>The mission of Expat Expert, said Robin Pascoe, a Canadian whose husband was a diplomat in the Canadian Foreign service for 15 years, is to ''inform, advise, and offer online friendship to relocating expatriate spouses and families.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Pascoe said she started the site (www.expatexpert.com) when she realized, ''how desperate expats are for online help with the emotional side of living abroad, which for the spouse can include giving up a career, major blows to self-esteem (you become Mrs. Husband's job) and general wear and tear on the mind and body from looking after everyone else.''</p>
        <p>The features on Expat Expert offer a perspective on recurrent issues, like culture shock, health emergencies and repatriation.</p>
        <p>The curious or the lonely expatriate can also find advice and resources at sites attached to publications, like The Weekly Telegraph (www.globalnetwork.co.uk) and The International Herald Tribune (www .iht.com), or organizations like the Canadian Foreign Service Community Association (www.fsca-acse.org) or Outpost (www .outpostexpat.nl), sponsored by Shell International.</p>
        <p>The number of expatriate sites is growing, and even if they do not get wandering souls closer to home, they give users a chance to bond with people engaged with similar issues.</p>
        <p>At the very least, surfing these Web sites helps kill time while waiting for a life-saving shipment of Reeses Peanut Butter Cups (or Twisties or Barry's Tea or Bovril).</p>
