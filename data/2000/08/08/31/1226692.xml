        <p>Drkoop.com, the struggling health information Web site, plans to cut its work force by 33 percent, bringing the number of employees down to 80. The cuts come after a group of investors provided the company with a much needed $27.5 million cash infusion last week. Drkoop.com laid off 35 percent of its staff in May. ''Drkoop's tremendous sales and marketing expenses, coupled with the lack of success they've had in getting a significant revenue stream from advertisers has led them to this point,'' said Rachel Terrace, a health analyst with Jupiter Communications. ''When the investors took over, they said they wanted to start running drkoop like a business, and their first order of business, to lay off employees, is not surprising.''</p>
