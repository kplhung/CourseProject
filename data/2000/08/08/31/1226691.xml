      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>A state superior court judge in San Francisco has allowed the first class-action suit to proceed against the Microsoft Corporation based on allegations that the software company used its monopoly to harm California consumers. Many similar suits have been filed across the country since Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of Federal District Court in Washington ruled that the company had violated federal antitrust laws. In the California case, Superior Court Judge Stuart R. Pollak said an unspecified number of California consumers could be represented in one trial to determine whether they were forced to pay unreasonably high prices for Microsoft Windows, Word and other products. Microsoft said it was reviewing the ruling. No trial date has been set.</p>
