        <p>George W. Bush and the Republicans have spent much of the presidential campaign promising to look out for the nation's children. They have gone so far as to hijack the phrase ''leave no child behind'' from the very liberal Children's Defense Fund.</p>
        <p>Trust me, it was odd watching Dick Cheney, who as a congressman voted against funding for Head Start, against subsidizing school lunches for poor children and against federal aid for college students, delivering the following lines to the very conservative delegates at the Republican convention in Philadelphia:</p>
        <p>''When George W. Bush is president and I am vice president, tests will be taken, results will be measured, schools will answer to parents, and no child will be left behind.''</p>
        <p>It is understandable that some voters might be skeptical. For years the G.O.P. has fended off new programs designed to help children, while fighting hard to slash support for those that already exist. It was Ronald Reagan's administration, during a celebrated assault on school lunches, that tried to have ketchup declared a vegetable.</p>
        <p>Now, with George W. Bush campaigning as a champion for children, we learn that the state of Texas has not bothered to comply with a 1996 consent decree requiring it to provide appropriate health care services to more than 1.5 million children who are eligible for Medicaid.</p>
        <p>U.S. District Judge William Wayne Justice ruled, among other things, that the state had failed to inform indigent families about the availability of health services, that managed-care plans to which some indigent Texans had been assigned were not providing the required services, and that approximately one million eligible individuals had received no dental care.</p>
        <p>''Basically, what we have is a Medicaid program in shambles,'' said Susan Zinn, a San Antonio lawyer who filed the class-action lawsuit that led to the consent decree.</p>
        <p>This is not just about health care. Dr. Irwin Redlener, a prominent New York pediatrician who has worked with children in all parts of the country, including Texas, has been looking for some time at the connection between children's health care and educational achievement.</p>
        <p>He believes it is impossible to meet the education needs of children without meeting their health care needs.</p>
        <p>''I think it's abundantly clear to both pediatricians and educators that health and the education potential of children are inexorably linked,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Redlener is a supporter of the Gore-Lieberman ticket and has been an adviser to Vice President Gore on health matters. So he is hardly nonpartisan. But his attempt to draw more attention to the link between health care and education is an important one. He talked to me more than a year ago about chronic medical conditions, like asthma and ear infections, that interfere with a child's ability to function in school.</p>
        <p>''Every pediatrician knows that under-treated or undiagnosed asthma is a disaster for school-age children,'' Dr. Redlener said yesterday. He noted that the wheezing and other forms of respiratory distress can be so intense as to make it almost impossible to concentrate on schoolwork.</p>
        <p>''And yet,'' he said, ''these symptoms are entirely controllable when there is access to a competent source of ongoing health care.''</p>
        <p>Ear infections are also common in young children. When they remain undiagnosed and untreated they can lead to hearing loss, inhibited language development and poor school performance. There are many other similar problems.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney may be sincere when they say they want to leave no child behind. But they come late to this issue. Mr. Cheney's Congressional voting record on legislation to help children was hideous. And Mr. Bush's Texas has an abysmal record on children's health issues.</p>
        <p>Moreover, Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney may have considerable trouble dragging other elements in their party -- the Trent Lotts, the Tom DeLays, the Dick Armeys -- anywhere near a progressive program for children.</p>
        <p>The Children's Defense Fund has been a terrific group for many years. Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney and the Republicans have stolen its motto. Now might be a good time to borrow its commitment.</p>
