        <p>denBROEDER-Frederick Adrian. The Henfield Foundation (of New York City) expresses its profound regret at the death on July 8, 2000 of its Senior Director, Frederick denBroeder of Tucson, AZ. Mr. denBroeder, a well known Art Historian, was particularly praised for his studies of the 18th Century in Rome, until recently an often neglected field. He was born in Detroit in 1935, studied at Kenyon College, took a degree at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, and studied, for several years, at the Courtauld Institute in London. He subsequently was a senior curator at the University of Connecticut at Storrs. He then became an active dealer in old master drawings, retiring in his last few years to Tucson. These were spent in travel and in a growing interest in the study of the art of the South West. He will be sadly missed by many friends and colleagues, not least by us at the Henfield Foundation.
