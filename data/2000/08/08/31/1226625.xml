        <p>For years it was nearly impossible for temporary workers to join unions, but the National Labor Relations Board issued a ruling yesterday that opened the door for many temps to join unions at their workplaces.</p>
        <p>The Washington-based labor board, in a 3-to-1 decision that took effect immediately, authorized temporary workers at a business to join the same union as the company's permanent workers without first obtaining permission from the employment agency that assigned the temps to the business.</p>
        <p>In its previous rulings, the board stated that temporary workers sent by an employment agency to a company could vote to join a union at the company only if the employment agency agreed. Temporary help agencies rarely gave the workers they sent to a company the go-ahead to join a union at the company.</p>
        <p>Officials with the A.F.L.-C.I.O. hailed the ruling, saying it would help improve wages, benefits and working conditions for many of the 1.2 million people employed by temporary agencies -- one of the fastest growing segments of the American work force.</p>
        <p>But many business groups criticized the ruling, insisting that it would raise production costs for many employers and might force companies to pay their temporary workers more than they had agreed to in their contract with temporary staffing agencies.</p>
        <p>The labor board ruled that in many cases temporary workers are in effect the employees of the user company and not of the agency and that, because of their similar circumstances, they should be treated as part of the same bargaining unit as the user company's permanent employees.</p>
        <p>The labor board wrote, ''A growing number of employees who are part of what is commonly described as the 'contingent work force' are being effectively denied representational rights guaranteed them under the National Labor Relations Act.''</p>
        <p>Under the decision, labor unions might simply petition the labor board to rule that several dozen temporary employees at a unionized work site should be added to the union bargaining unit, even without a vote by the temporary workers.</p>
        <p>At a time when the union movement is straining to add workers, the decision was important for labor because the number of people working for temporary help agencies soared more than sixfold from 1982 to 1998, while jobs over all grew by 41 percent.</p>
        <p>John J. Sweeney, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s president, said the ruling ''is an important step in addressing the rights of contingent work force employees, who have too often been relegated to second-class status and rights, if any.''</p>
        <p>Charles Craver, a labor relations expert at George Washington University, said, ''For unionized firms that have been bringing in temporary workers to save money, that benefit may be lost because all of a sudden those temp workers may have to be in the same bargaining unit as the permanent workers. As a result, there will be less incentive to use outside workers.''</p>
        <p>David Miller, a lawyer for one of the companies that lost the case, the Jeffboat Division of the American Commercial Marine Service Company, said, ''This could be a devastating decision. It means that these employees could be covered by the wages and benefits in a union contract when neither the user company or the temp agency had considered that.''</p>
