        <p>One religious leader among hundreds who have come from around the world to New York this week to talk about peace, Dastur Firoze M. Kotwal said he hoped the four-day gathering fosters friendships across faith boundaries, a sharing of viewpoints and ''unity among religions.''</p>
        <p>''And this,'' added Dr. Kotwal, a soft-spoken, bearded dastur, or high priest among Zoroastrians in Bombay, India, ''will suppress violence and terrorism that is going on in the name of religion.''</p>
        <p>He was not alone in expressing such hopes for the Millennium World Peace Summit of Religious and Spiritual Leaders, which convened late Monday afternoon at the United Nations and has since moved to a nearby hotel.</p>
        <p>Funded largely by corporations,  the conference has brought together people as distinguished by their professed good intentions as by the diversity of their theologies and the different hues and shapes of their dress.</p>
        <p>Talking about how they might work together to stifle conflict, ease poverty and help the environment are Shiite Muslims in dark turbans, Buddhist monks in saffron robes, black-suited Christian clerics and men and women from tribal groups.</p>
        <p>After a formal opening at the United Nations, group discussions have been closed. On Thursday, the conference is to issue a declaration endorsing specific measures on behalf of world peace.</p>
        <p>In interviews, several participants called the event significant for its venue, having allowed religious leaders access en masse to the United Nations -- a forum typically reserved for political leaders -- and for having afforded people of such diverse backgrounds the chance to meet. ''This is very important,'' said Gensho Hozumi, chief priest of a Zen Buddhist temple in Kyoto, Japan. ''For the first time, to be heard in the United Nations.''</p>
        <p>But a major shadow over the conference has been the absence of the Dalai Lama, spiritual leader of Tibet, whose participation at the United Nations was blocked by China's objections.</p>
        <p>Some of the conference's business has been taking place informally in the hotel corridors, where participants meet one another, exchange business cards, even take each other's photos.</p>
        <p>For some, the sight of such harmony has imparted the sense that a common purpose is at work. ''It's good to see we are all here to work for peace, and for the love of God, and to do something for the society,'' said Sister Marie-Odila Perochan, dressed in a full nun's habit, a crucifix around her neck. She is a member of Fraternite Notre-Dame, a Roman Catholic order based in France, which runs charitable projects worldwide, including one in Harlem.</p>
        <p>Among participants, a frequent theme is that government officials need to know that religious leaders still carry considerable influence and thus could help in large-scale good works.</p>
        <p>Sayyed Mohammed Musawi, secretary general of the World Ahlul Bayt Islamic League, a Shiite Muslim organization based in London, said that ''the United Nations' noble causes cannot be implemented by governments only, unless there is participation'' by people within those nations. ''And nobody can influence the people of the nations more than the religious leaders,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In addition to talking about peace, some have come with specific concerns, particularly related to the environment. Paul Gualingua Toala, a member of a three-man delegation representing the Quichua, an Indian group in Ecuador, said the delegation wants to spread the word about ecological problems in the Amazon.</p>
        <p>Wylee LaRocque, a member of the Turtle Mountain Band of the Chippewa, from Belcourt, N.D., voiced a broadly similar concern. ''To take care of the earth,'' he said, when asked what message the Chippewas wanted to send.</p>
        <p>''If there's a thing that all people have in common, regardless of race or income level, we all live on the same planet,'' said Mr. LaRocque, whose eagle feather headdress, rabbit bone vest and beaded moccasins made him a person with whom a stream of delegates wanted to have their pictures taken.</p>
        <p>But some participants also said they were disappointed that time allotted for individual speakers was too short to allow much depth of discussion in the formal sessions.</p>
        <p>Rabbi Rene Samuel Sirat, former chief rabbi of France and currently vice president of the conference of rabbis of Europe, said, ''There are so many people here who would like to express themselves, and they're only given a limited time to get their message across.'' He suggested that another such meeting, perhaps in two or three years, could build on the momentum.</p>
        <p>And at least one person at the conference voiced concern about the challenge posed by religious leaders not attending, whose views are antithetical to peaceful encounters between faiths.</p>
        <p>''We have to marginalize religious leaders who are peace spoilers and are inciting hatred and nationalistic passions, which destroys life,'' said Rabbi Arthur Schneier of New York, president of the Appeal of Conscience Foundation, which has sought to foster interfaith dialogue.</p>
        <p>''It's nice to come together here,'' he said, ''but we have a lot of those who are out there who are not in sync, and who are seeking to undermine our peacemaking, bridge-building efforts.''</p>
