        <p>It is a primary race that has spawned a soap opera-like drama. The bitterness of a feud between two Democrats in the 11th Congressional District in Brooklyn has not only torn apart a longstanding friendship but has also delivered some of that anguish to the doorsteps of other politicians and voters in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>But it is also a contest that has brought to the surface simmering -- and often unspoken -- tension between black New Yorkers whose roots are in the United States and those with Caribbean heritage. In her campaign for Congress, Una Clarke, the Jamaican-born city councilwoman, has not only heralded her Caribbean roots in the campaign, but has also accused her old friend and mentor, United States Representative Major R. Owens, of being anti-immigrant. Mr. Owens, who was born in Memphis, has accused Ms. Clarke of trying to turn black Brooklynites against one another by using ethnic chauvinism to get votes.</p>
        <p>As a result, theirs has not just been a political contest. It has represented a springboard for many to consider anew the relationship between two groups of black New Yorkers who  often have their own share of prejudices against one another. At the same time, it has focused attention on the political impact of New York's growing Caribbean population.</p>
        <p>''There has always been some degree of tension between African-Americans and Caribbean-Americans over the years,'' said Don Quinn Kelley, a professor of history at Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn. ''Color is the thing the two have in common. But there are misconceptions, and some degree of mistrust.'' And a campaign like the one between Mr. Owens and Ms. Clarke, he said,  ''causes people to focus on them again.''</p>
        <p>Some of that mistrust may come from a natural succession that has become part of the fabric of New York: the latest immigrant group encroaching on the territory of earlier groups. In this case, the wariness has been complicated by the fact that many American-born blacks in New York City have not had the same economic success that earlier groups of immigrants had.</p>
        <p>''African-Americans have not translated their gains in the public sector in the way that the Jews or the Italians did,'' said Philip Kasinitz, a professor of sociology at the City University Graduate Center and author of the book ''Caribbean New York.'' ''So, when they face the same issues of ethnic succession, in this case by Caribbeans, it seems that there is more to lose. And that contributes to the tension.''</p>
        <p>For years, Mr. Owens and Ms. Clarke were the closest of friends. Mr. Owens, who was first elected to Congress 18 years ago, was a prominent benefactor to Ms. Clarke when she switched from a career as a child care administrator to elective politics a decade ago. They have worked on each other's campaigns. Their families socialized with each other over the years, and they attended family events and weddings together.</p>
        <p>But with Ms. Clarke's decision to oppose her onetime mentor in the  Democratic primary on Sept. 12, the relationship has dissolved into pure rancor. And while Mr. Owens has the advantage of incumbency and the support of most local officials, Ms. Clarke is well financed and could pose a tough challenge.</p>
        <p>Today, they barely muster a nod when their paths cross on the campaign trail. ''If we're both in the same place, I prefer to avoid her,'' Mr. Owens said in an interview last week. ''If I can't avoid her, then I suppose I will at least say hello.''</p>
        <p>To Ms. Clarke, a 64-year-old legislator known for her sharp tongue and her championing of immigrant rights, Mr. Owens, also 64, is a tired congressman who has grown ineffective and disconnected. ''It's not about friendship,'' she said. ''Too much has been made of friendship. It's about leadership and effectiveness. I don't think he has kept up with the needs of the changing community.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Owens sees Ms. Clarke's challenge through a different lens. It is, he insists, spurred purely by her desire to cling to public office in the face of a term-limit law that prohibits her from running for re-election to the City Council.</p>
        <p>''She has no reason to run against me,'' he said, ''except for her interest in keeping a job. She has no platform. We agree on just about every issue.''</p>
        <p>In the midst of this clash are a number of Brooklyn Democrats with close ties to both officials who are uncomfortable about having to take sides and mournful that the congressman and the councilwoman are at war.</p>
        <p>''This is a difficult thing to watch because many of us admire and respect both of them,'' said John L. Sampson, a state senator from the Canarsie section of Brooklyn, whose parents are African-American and Guyanese. ''They used to work together on all kinds of things. But now, to see them attack each other, is like seeing a breach within a family. It's painful to see.''</p>
        <p>The campaign's tone has also been highly divisive, many Brooklyn politicians insist.</p>
        <p>Mr. Owens says that by appealing to voters based on her Jamaican background, Ms. Clarke has crossed the line between ethnic pride and demagoguery. In a recent debate on New York 1, the cable news network, he likened those tactics to Hitler's.</p>
        <p>Ms. Clarke said the congressman accused her of something she has never done. ''I appeal to everyone in every community,'' she said. Ms. Clarke added that it was the congressman who was trying to place a wedge between citizens born here and those born overseas. The debate  turned into a shouting match, with Ms. Clarke declaring repeatedly, ''Major Owens, you're a liar.''</p>
        <p>The 11th Congressional District includes the neighborhoods of Flatbush and Brownsville and extends into Crown Heights, Prospect Heights and Park Slope. The population is about 55 percent black, with more than two-thirds of those being Caribbean blacks. The district is also about 25 percent white, which includes a significant population of Orthodox Jewish voters.</p>
        <p>Most of the elected officials in central Brooklyn have endorsed Mr. Owens, saying that his seniority in Congress would place him in a position to be chairman of a committee or subcommittee, should the Democrats regain control of the House. Moreover, while many officials complain that the congressman's record has been unremarkable, they say he has nonetheless been effective and has roots deep in the community.</p>
        <p>Mr. Owens was a commissioner of the city's antipoverty program when he entered elective politics, running for the State Senate in 1974. A reserved legislator, Mr. Owens often backed candidates who ran against officials supported by the traditional Democratic leadership in Brooklyn, making him a leader of a group of insurgents who, he said, needed a stronger voice in the politics of the borough.</p>
        <p>And when Mr. Owens first ran for Congress in 1982 -- for the seat of the retiring incumbent, Shirley Chisholm, who was born in Brooklyn but got her early schooling in Barbados  -- he won in a bitter and close contest with Vander L. Beatty, another state senator who was backed by the Democratic Party organization. He has not had a difficult race since.</p>
        <p>He met Ms. Clarke in the 1980's, when she was a day care administrator who was becoming increasingly active in politics. When the City Council was being expanded, Mr. Owens pushed for the creation of a district that would include enough of the growing Caribbean community to make it possible for a West Indian Council member to be elected. He supported Ms. Clarke in her first, and ultimately successful, run for City Council, in 1991, over the candidate supported by the Democratic organization.</p>
        <p>Mr. Owens is facing a formidable opponent in Ms. Clarke. She has been endorsed by Kenneth C. Fisher, a city councilman who is considered a leading candidate for Brooklyn borough president, and by Edward I. Koch, the former mayor. She has raised $188,000 for her campaign. And although Congressman Owens has raised $287,000, all her money has come from individuals, while more than half of Mr. Owens's contributions have come from political action committees.</p>
        <p>(In her 1997 re-election campaign, Ms. Clarke was accused of campaign finance irregularities and is appealing a $48,000 fine.)</p>
        <p>The congressman has taken great pains to portray Ms. Clarke as an ally of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, which is not considered a plus in this heavily Democratic district. He charges that Ms. Clarke has not been outspoken about incidents where police brutality was alleged, pointing out that he was arrested during civil disobedience activities while she had not been.</p>
        <p>''I dare say that I will get far more Caribbean votes than she will,'' Mr. Owens said. ''And I will get more Jewish votes, too. I haven't just started forging relationships in this community.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Clarke suggests that she expects Caribbean and Jewish voters to respond favorably to her view on Mr. Owens's stewardship.</p>
        <p>She denies his contention that she is motivated by term limits; rather, she calls it a sincere desire to improve the quality of representation in the district.</p>
        <p>''When you ask people in the district to name a couple of things that the incumbent has done that demand his remaining, they are hard pressed,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, she said, she is saddened that so many people view the race in terms of the relationship she and Mr. Owens previously shared rather than the need for improved leadership.</p>
        <p>''I wish people would not focus on that,'' she said of the erstwhile friendship. ''After all, many people have been married 25 or 30 years and they go for a divorce and nobody says, shame on them.'' She added: ''We had a political alliance. And the fact is, political alliances are just that and nothing more.''</p>
