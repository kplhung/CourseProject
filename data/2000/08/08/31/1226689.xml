      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>A spectacular fire last night engulfed a sprawling apartment complex under construction near the Hudson River in Edgewater, N.J., destroyed or damaged at least eight occupied homes across the street, and sent columns of flame 200 feet into the air.</p>
        <p>No serious injuries were reported as of 12:30 this morning, but dozens of homes were evacuated. Several firefighters were treated for heat exhaustion and smoke inhalation.</p>
        <p>Shortly after midnight, fire officials said they had contained the blaze but could not put it out, in part because it was being fed by a ruptured gas line in the center of the apartment complex. Public Service Electric and Gas was unable to get to the valves to shut off the line, said the Edgewater fire chief, Sam DeNorchia. Another gas line, on Undercliff Avenue, where the occupied dwellings burned, also ruptured, the chief said.</p>
        <p>From the Palisades, the cliffs that overlook Edgewater, the scene of the blaze, which covered several acres, resembled a lake of fire. Homeowners on top of the Palisades in the town of Cliffside Park doused their lawns to keep the fire from spreading to them, and firefighters stood near the cliff's edge and shot water 150 feet down onto the flames.</p>
        <p>Even at the top of the cliff, the heat was so intense that firefighters had to hose down the firefighters working closest to the cliff.</p>
        <p>The fire began around 8:15 p.m. at Avalon River Mews, a 400-unit complex consisting of an H-shaped, seven-story structure and seven other buildings under construction on the inland side of River Road. Within minutes, it was as if a curtain of flame had been drawn across the waterfront.</p>
        <p>On Undercliff Avenue, just west of the complex, residents described a huge fireball shooting up the street.</p>
        <p>''Everybody's windows went red,'' said Debbie Bonhan, a resident. ''The whole sky was illuminated, the power went out. People were running around because they didn't know where the fire was.'' Hundreds of homes surrounding the fire lost power.</p>
        <p>Chief DeNorchia said that the first of the more than 200 firefighters who eventually arrived on the scene did not know where to begin. ''When you pulled up, it was, 'I got a fire here, I got a fire here and I've got another fire here,' '' he said.</p>
        <p>Fire officials were especially concerned because Avalon River Mews, built on the site of an old Alcoa aluminum plant, is only about a hundred yards from a tank farm -- a field of giant tanks filled with gasoline. Only an empty warehouse stands between the condominium complex and the tanks. Officials said they were taking steps to protect the tank farm from the flames.</p>
        <p>The fire began in the southeast corner of the H-shaped structure and spread at a furious speed. One witness, Jeff Louisot, 24, said that in no more than 10 minutes the entire structure was aflame.</p>
        <p>As it consumed the apartment complex, the fire jumped across Undercliff Avenue, which runs parallel to River Road on the west side of Avalon River Mews, and began chewing its way through the apartments and houses there.</p>
        <p>The mayor of Edgewater, Bryan Christiansen, said the cause of the blaze had not yet been determined.</p>
        <p>''We have no idea at this point,'' he said at 11:15 p.m. as he stood on Undercliff Avenue watching firefighters from a dozen towns struggle to keep more houses from burning.</p>
        <p>As he spoke, a three-story house nearby collapsed.</p>
        <p>''There goes that one,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Many cars along Undercliff Avenue exploded from the heat of the fire, Chief DeNorchia said.</p>
        <p>''The radiant heat it generated was tremendous,'' he said. ''It was the worst fire I've encountered outside a building in 20 years.''</p>
        <p>Across River Road, Edgewater's main thoroughfare, a shopping center parking lot filled with people who came to watch the fire.</p>
        <p>Clouds of smoke and ash filled the air, lighted from beneath by the orange flame. Periodically, chunks of building broke off or collapsed.</p>
        <p>The fire was also watched by thousands of Manhattan residents -- Avalon River Mews is across the Hudson River from about 125th Street.</p>
        <p>Anthony Bourdain, who watched from the windows of his apartment on Riverside Drive, said, ''It looks like an oil field fire, with periodic explosions of pressurized flame that extend higher than the Palisades.''</p>
        <p>Avalon River Mews is part of the transformation of the Hudson riverfront from factories and rail yards into some of the most desirable residential real estate in the region.</p>
        <p>Before beginning construction, the developer and Alcoa had to spend millions to clean up PCB's and other contaminants.</p>
        <p>Construction on the 408-unit complex began last September, said Gary Steinfield, the vice president for development of the complex's owner, Avalon Bay Communities, which is based in Iselin N.J. The first apartment were going to be occupied in December, he said.</p>
        <p>As he watched the $70 million project go up in flames, Mr. Steinfield tried to be philosophical.</p>
        <p>''At the end of the day,'' he said, the most important thing is life and safety.''</p>
