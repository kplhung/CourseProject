        <p>American and Russian officials dedicated a 10-acre industrial park today at what was until recently a nuclear-weapons factory east of Moscow. It was the second step in a joint project that American experts hope will provide jobs for up to 4,000 Russian weapons scientists and workers.</p>
        <p>Energy Secretary Bill Richardson attended the ceremony, in the once-closed nuclear city of Sarov, several hundred miles east of Moscow. The stop was part of a weeklong sweep through Russia and other former Soviet states in which Mr. Richardson is promoting programs to curb the spread of nuclear materials and technology.</p>
        <p>The United States will contribute $4.5 million next year to help prepare buildings at the Sarov site for private businesses, and hopes to spend $8.5 million more on other programs there in 2001, American officials said today. Mr. Richardson said the first tenant at the new Sarov Technopark at Avangard, as the site is called, would be a German-American venture to make kidney-dialysis machines and supplies.</p>
        <p>A Michigan company also is studying prospects for manufacturing auto parts in the park, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Richardson toured the remaining operating section of the top-secret Avangard weapons plant, which is now devoted to dismantling nuclear arms.</p>
        <p>In an interview, he said his tour, the first by an American official, was evidence that ''despite American-Russian relations suffering a few glitches, in the area of transparency of nuclear weapons there has been quite a bit of progress.''</p>
        <p>Military cooperation between Russia and the United States has cooled considerably since NATO's air war against one of the Kremlin's closest European allies, Yugoslavia, last spring.</p>
        <p>''This is a breakthrough in securing Russian nuclear materials and persuading Russian scientists to stay home and not sell their expertise to rogue states,'' Mr. Richardson said.</p>
        <p>About 3,500 people worked at the Avangard plant. The kidney-dialysis venture should employ about 200, and 100 more work at a second Russian-American project, a computing center at which scientists and programmers turn their expertise to commercial ventures.</p>
        <p>Officials said today that Credit Suisse First Boston has awarded a contract to the center to develop electronic-banking and e-commerce software. Motorola Corporation also is considering employing the computing center for software projects, officials said.</p>
        <p>The computing center already conducts research for the petroleum industry and in high-energy physics, among other programs.</p>
        <p>The Energy Department's Nuclear Cities Initiative has targeted Sarov and nine other weapons centers for programs to retrain their employees for commercial work, primarily to prevent rogue states from buying Russian nuclear expertise.</p>
        <p>The three-year-old conversion program is under way so far in only two cities. But American officials said today that the effort at Sarov has succeeded well enough to allow Russian officials to step up their timetable from 2005 to 2003 for closing the entire weapons plant, the oldest of four that manufactured nuclear bombs for the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>Mr. Richardson flew late today from Sarov to the Pacific coastal city of Vladivostok, where he will help dedicate two upgraded sites to safeguard the highly enriched uranium used in Russian Navy nuclear vessels.</p>
