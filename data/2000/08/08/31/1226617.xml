        <p>Most students starting high school in New York City next month are at risk of failing the five Regents exams that will be required for a high school diploma starting in 2003, according to a report released yesterday by the public advocate's office.</p>

        <p>Most students starting high school in New York City next month are at risk of failing the five Regents exams that will be required for a high school diploma starting in 2003, according to a report released yesterday by the public advocate's office.</p>
        <p>The report concludes that most incoming freshmen fall short in reading, math and other benchmarks of academic achievement, and blames poor instruction in elementary and middle school for the situation. The city's neighborhood high schools, called zoned schools, have more problems than schools with more selective entrance requirements, the report says.</p>
        <p>It recommends that the city shift governance of neighborhood high schools from the schools chancellor to school superintendents, who will then theoretically be more responsible for the performance of students through 12th grade.</p>
        <p>''Simply saying that students have to meet these desirable higher Regents standards won't make it happen,'' said Mark Green, the public advocate. ''Standards without resources are creating a looming education crisis.''</p>
        <p>Both Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy's office and the office of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani declined to comment on the report's findings.</p>
        <p>The report, based on Board of Education data, should provide ammunition for critics of tougher standards, who have warned that the new Regents requirements would keep many students from earning a high school diploma, forcing them to take equivalency exams to graduate.</p>
        <p>Students are having a hard enough time graduating as it is, the report says, with only slightly more than half graduating in four years. Less than a third of those receive a Regents diploma, which is earned by passing exams in English, math, United States history, global studies and science. Starting with the class of 2003, students will be required to pass all five subjects to graduate.</p>
        <p>The report attributes the poor performance to the fact that most students leaving middle school are not prepared for high school. In the spring of this year, more than 60 percent of students in seventh grade failed to reach full mastery of English as measured by the citywide reading test, and more than 70 percent fell short of mastery of mathematics.</p>
        <p>The age of incoming high school students also appears to be problematic, the report says. It shows that almost one-third of incoming freshmen have been held back at least once in elementary or middle school. In some large zoned schools, that figure rises to more than 50 percent.</p>
        <p>''What's clear is that students are leaving middle school in such a deep educational hole that they have trouble climbing out of it in high school,'' Mr. Green said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Green's suggestion that school superintendents take control of neighborhood high schools could draw criticism from those who believe superintendents are overly influenced by local school boards, which appoint them pending final approval from the chancellor. Many school boards have been repeatedly suspended because investigators found indications of corruption or incompetence.</p>
