        <p>Sam Hitt letter disputes August 24 editorial on need for new approach in fighting forest fires</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>We certainly need ''A New Approach to Forest Fires'' (editorial, Aug. 24), but an expensive new program to thin small trees over 40 million acres would be very costly and solve only part of a complex problem created, in large measure, by decades of industrial logging.</p>
        <p>A better solution is to redirect $1 billion in logging and road-building subsidies to reduce flammable vegetation around communities and pay for badly needed projects that control soil erosion, protect water quality and enhance wildlife habitat.</p>

        <p>This wouldn't cost taxpayers a cent and would restore fire-adapted ecosystems to a more natural condition. Removing outdated subsidies to the timber industry would also dramatically diminish threats to remaining ancient forests and roadless areas.</p>
