        <p>Three young neo-Nazis were convicted of murder today for beating an African immigrant to death, and one of them was sentenced to life imprisonment, the heaviest punishment under German law.</p>
        <p>Deliberating in a case that has become a symbol of the virulence of anti-immigrant sentiment among many youths in the former East Germany, Judge Albrecht Hennig said the victim, Alberto Adriano, a 39-year-old meatpacker from Mozambique, had been killed because of the color of his skin.</p>
        <p>Judge Hennig, who reached his verdict without a jury, said, ''It was the latest in a long series of attacks to which we must put an end.'' That series began on Nov. 25, 1990, when an Angolan was killed by rightists in the eastern town of Eberswalde, and has continued sporadically ever since, drawing occasional national attention.</p>
        <p>Such attention has grown of late, with the government seemingly awakening to the fact that neo-Nazi violence, however marginal, has a terrible impact on Germany's image. Chancellor Gerhard Schroder, who is likely to visit a memorial to Mr. Adriano this week in Dessau, where he lived, appealed today for a mass movement against racism.</p>
        <p>''We need the engagement of civil society,'' Mr. Schroder said in a television interview. ''We need a repeat of what the people in the east of our country did in the peaceful revolution of 10 years ago, an involvement in the fight for what is right.''</p>
        <p>The chancellor was referring to the demonstrations that led to the collapse of the East German state and the Berlin Wall, a time of euphoric optimism. But a tough reality has emerged since then: high unemployment in the east, bitterness at the western takeover of the area, nostalgia for the security of socialism.</p>
        <p>Against this backdrop, rightist, anti-foreigner movements have proved attractive to some youths in the east, though an overwhelming majority of immigrants in Germany live in the west. Christian Richter, one of the accused, said he had attacked Mr. Adriano ''because foreigners take our jobs.''</p>
        <p>The court sentenced Enrico Hilprecht, 24, to life imprisonment. Mr. Richter, 16, and Frank Miethbauer, also 16, were sentenced to nine years of detention, one year less than the maximum sentence under Germany's juvenile law.</p>
        <p>In a climate of agitation over rightist violence since a bomb in Dusseldorf last month wounded nine immigrants, the sentences were clearly intended to signal that Germany has lost patience with xenophobia and rightist nationalism.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schroder said the police and judiciary needed to be tougher on extremists. Some evidence has emerged that the police in the east  are reluctant to crack down on the rightists because of tacit sympathy for their cause.</p>
        <p>In the latest incident of racist violence, prosecutors in the northern town of Lubeck said today that they had arrested two skinheads on charges of wounding a 33-year-old African in an attack on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Adriano was kicked and beaten in a Dessau park on June 11 and died three days later without recovering consciousness. He was married to a German woman and had three children, the youngest 7 months old.</p>
        <p>His wife, Angelika, did not appear in court today after receiving a threatening letter now being examined by the prosecutor's office in Dessau. Razak Minhel, the Dessau city official responsible for foreigners, said Mrs. Adriano was ''too scared to leave her children alone and come to court.''</p>
