        <p>Minutes after Rick Reed used his no-fuss, no-mess approach to calmly lead the Mets past the Houston Astros, 1-0, last night at Shea Stadium, Manager Bobby Valentine leaned forward in his office chair and said he believes that he will be back managing the Mets next year.</p>
        <p>While Valentine said that there have not been formal contract discussions with Fred Wilpon, the Mets' co-owner, the manager said that he has had encouraging conversations with Wilpon. Those discussions earlier this month have apparently convinced Valentine that he will be offered an extension to continue managing a team that is bound for the postseason for the second straight year.</p>
        <p>''I have a good feeling that there's a chance I'll be back with this team next year,'' Valentine said. ''A good chance. It's a feeling.'' Valentine paused and emphasized, ''It's a little more than a feeling.''</p>
        <p>Valentine stressed that he did not want to speak too openly about his job status while the Mets focus on keeping pace with the Atlanta Braves, who remained tied for first place in the National League East with the Mets after defeating the Reds, 5-2. But, even after Valentine tried to distance himself from a subject that has hovered over the Mets this season, he reiterated that he has ''a good feeling'' about returning for the 2001 season and beyond.</p>
        <p>The Mets (79-54) are tied with the Braves for the best record in the major leagues and are trying to win their first World Series since 1986. Valentine and General Manager Steve Phillips are in the final year of their contracts, and there has been speculation that Valentine may test the job market. But that might not happen with Valentine now.</p>
        <p>Phillips said that ownership has always been supportive and that he is hopeful that his status will be addressed in a ''positive fashion.''</p>
        <p>As recently as two weeks ago, Wilpon, who was unavailable for comment last night, said that Valentine and Phillips would be evaluated after the season.</p>
        <p>''I didn't say they had to do any more,'' Wilpon said. ''We do things in an orderly manner, after the contracts are completed.''</p>
        <p>Before Valentine and Phillips addressed the future, Reed, who can also be a free agent after the season, addressed the present by using his typically swift and efficient pace -- the game lasted 2 hours 25 minutes -- to stifle the Astros. Reed held the Astros without a hit until the fifth inning, and he allowed only three singles in seven innings while helping the Mets remain in first place this late in the season for the first time since 1990. Benny Agbayani scored the only run when Chris Holt unleashed a two-out wild pitch with Mike Piazza batting in the first.</p>
        <p>There is no fussing with Reed. He  takes the sign, he winds up and he usually throws a pitch that is close to the strike zone. Then Reed retreats to the pitcher's rubber and repeats the same routine, eager to keep the game moving. ''He doesn't waste any time,'' Valentine said.</p>
        <p>Reed's fastball almost never reaches 90 miles an hour, but he locates all of his pitches so precisely that the fastball looks more imposing. That helped make the Astros look helpless.</p>
        <p>Reed (9-4) said he felt terrific warming up in the bullpen, and catcher Piazza noticed that he had a fierce fastball, so he kept signaling for fastballs. It worked. Other than a dizzy spell in the third, which Reed solved with water and one bite of a nutrition bar, he had little trouble. No Astros even reached third.</p>
        <p>''Mike called for the first pitch tonight and I hit his mitt,'' Reed said. ''I knew it was going to be something special.''</p>
        <p>The fans picked up on Reed's no-hit bid in the fifth and clapped rhythmically when he notched the first out. Thirteen outs without a hit, 14 more to go. Bill Spiers, who was 4 for 15 against Reed in his career, worked the count to 3-2. Reed had three strikeouts at that point, and all three had been on fastballs. Would Spiers be expecting a fastball? Maybe. Reed threw a changeup that stayed high, and Spiers flicked it into left for a single.</p>
        <p>With the chance for a no-hitter eliminated, the fans gave Reed a polite ovation. All Reed did was go back to work. He retired Tim Bogar on a twisting liner to right and struck out Holt with a curveball. The Astros finally had their first hit, but they still looked anemic against Reed.</p>
        <p>''There's something about his calm demeanor and the poise he shows that exudes inner confidence,'' Todd Zeile said. ''That helps our guys. I never feel like they're going to get to him. Every time they get to him, I'm surprised.''</p>
        <p>After Agbayani, the 225-pound leadoff man, walked in the first and Darryl Hamilton's bunt single moved him to second, Edgardo Alfonzo rapped into a double play. Holt looked as if he might emerge unscathed, but he bounced a curveball to Piazza and Agbayani cruised home.</p>
        <p>Reed did the rest, routinely, with help from Turk Wendell in the eighth and Armando Benitez, who struck out the side in the ninth.</p>
        <p>''The baseball purist finds a lot of joy,'' in a 1-0 game, Valentine said. ''A manager finds a lot of joy when it's over and he's got the one run.''</p>
        <p>Last night, Valentine got the one run. Next year, the Mets will probably get more of Valentine.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>MIKE PIAZZA hyperextended his left knee when he touched first base awkwardly while running out an infield single, but he said, ''It's nothing major.'' . . . ROBIN VENTURA, who took early batting practice with Manager BOBBY VALENTINE as the pitcher, ended an 0-for-14 slide with a single in the fourth. ''Those swings in those at-bats were Robin,'' Valentine said. . . . BILLY TRABER, the Mets' first-round draft pick, did not attend classes at Loyola Marymount yesterday, so the negotiating window stayed open, but General Manager STEVE PHILLIPS doubted that an agreement would be reached. ''I'm not hopeful on Traber,'' Phillips said. ''My inclination is he'll end up going back to school.''... Phillips said the Mets would recall 5 to 10 players from Class AAA Norfolk in two waves, on Friday and on Tuesday. Phillips would not divulge the names, but he offered indications that JOE McEWING, MATT FRANCO, RICH RODRIGUEZ, GRANT ROBERTS, ERIC CAMMACK, VANCE WILSON, DAVID LAMB and JORGE TOCA would be recalled.</p>
