        <p>Somalia finally has a government, and its first president in nearly a decade arrived here today escorted by at least 120 pickup trucks carrying more than 1,000 militiamen armed with rifles, rocket launchers, even double-barreled antiaircraft guns.</p>
        <p>And just to be on the safe side, the president wore a bulletproof vest.</p>
        <p>Despite the fears, the closest the new president, Abdikassim Salad Hassan, came to harm was from Somalis a little too eager to show their affection -- overjoyed that their country might finally be leaving behind years of civil war.</p>
        <p>Mr. Salad arrived at midday at a downtown soccer stadium packed with tens of thousands of Somalis cheering and waving sprigs of small red flowers.</p>
        <p>He tried to speak. But after just a few words, he was nearly crushed by well-wishers, forcing him to flee the stadium, jostled around the eye of a dangerous storm of happy people.</p>
        <p>''The new president -- too much they like him,'' said Sandal Agdige, 31, an unemployed driver who had just pried himself loose from the swarming crowds at the stadium.</p>
        <p>For the new leaders of Somalia, who were chosen during the past few weeks at a peace conference in Djibouti, the country to the northwest, it was a hopeful first step in restoring order and a central government to a nation with neither since 1991. The conference had been organized by Djibouti's president, Ismail Omar Guelleh, who was eager to see stability brought to the Horn of Africa.</p>
        <p>The immediate worry for the president's safety arose because of the warlords who have divided power in the nine years of chaos, and who in recent weeks have vowed to oppose the new government. Some had said they would even physically block the arrival of its new leaders.</p>
        <p>But nothing happened on this first day. Some militiamen aligned with the warlords even bucked their leaders to greet Mr. Salad, who said his first day back home as president convinced him that this new government would work.</p>
        <p>''The people of Somalia are fed up with wars, violence, killing, tribalism,'' Mr. Salad, 58, said in an interview later in the calm of his hotel room. ''You have seen the people, many thousands, hundreds of thousands of people. No one can have fear if he is surrounded by such well-meaning crowds.''</p>
        <p>For some in the entourage, which flew in on two chartered airplanes from Djibouti, it was a moment of high emotion. Many had not been to Somalia for 10 years or more.</p>
        <p>''I must be honest with you, this was really overwhelming,'' said Ali Khalif Galaydh, also 58, a former government official who left Somalia in 1982 and has since taught at Harvard and Syracuse University. Mr. Khalif, a member of the new Somali assembly and a leading candidate to be prime minister, said the reception showed ''how hungry people are for good news.''</p>
        <p>But today was only a tentative victory, and a reminder of the huge job ahead for the Somalis, whose last government crumbled in civil war when the long-time dictator, Muhammad Siad Barre, fell from power in 1991. Three of the main warlords in Mogadishu happened to be out of town, meeting with the president of Yemen, who was trying to persuade them to support Mr. Salad. But they remain a threat.</p>
        <p>Even if the warlords end up on Mr. Salad's side, the streets he drove through today served as one vivid indication of how scarred Somalia remains from its civil war and a later attempt by the United Nations to feed the hungry in the early 1990's. On one main road, twisted and rusty cars are piled up along the median. On another lies the skeleton of a United Nations armored vehicle. Trash is scattered everywhere, in a once-beautiful seaside city with no central electricity, water, police or schools. The outside world, exhausted with Somalia, has not been eager to help.</p>
        <p>''It is a very difficult task,'' Mr. Salad said. ''We need everything. Every sector is in shambles.'' In fact, Mr. Salad's presidency is itself but an idea. He does not even have an office to work out of, much less an organized army to command or any government ministers to manage.</p>
        <p>Moreover, Mr. Salad's transitional government must still deal with the leaders of two autonomous regions in the north who have refused to recognize his authority. The regions, Somaliland and Puntland, had established relatively peaceful pockets beyond the violence of Mogadishu.</p>
        <p>The new president must also contend with the nearly impossible expectations of Somalis, who seem to believe a government will be panacea for all their problems.</p>
        <p>''I don't have a job,'' said Aweys Salad, 18 (who is not related to the president). ''When I get a government, I will get everything I need. I want an education. We need education. Education is the light of the world.''</p>
        <p>President Salad was chosen over the weekend in an unusual peace conference of more than 2,000 Somalis, a cross-section of every clan, who had gathered in Djibouti for five months of touchy negotiations. The delegates also managed to write a national charter, something like a transitional constitution, and decided the president would be based in Mogadishu, with other parts of the government northwest of there, in Baidoa.</p>
        <p>Mr. Salad was chosen by a 245-member assembly that was formed in Djibouti, which will sit for three years as a transitional government before national elections. The conference purposely sidelined the warlords, which is one reason they oppose the new arrangement.</p>
        <p>Though Somalis often talk about the dangers of clan, one of Mr. Salad's main qualifications was, in fact, his clan background: He is a leader of the Hawiye, specifically the Habr Gidir subclan, which dominates Mogadishu, the main area of unrest.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Salad, a trim man with still-black hair and a graying beard, had also campaigned on a law-and-order platform attractive to many Somalis. He has close ties to the Islamic courts -- with their own police and jails -- that were established in recent years. And he has support among Mogadishu's increasingly influential business community, which pushed for peace as a requirement for making money.</p>
        <p>He also gained credibility because, unlike some candidates, he lives in Mogadishu, and in recent years had overseen a broad effort to re-unite the Hawiye. He is said to be personally tough and dogged, and in the interview, he outlined an ambitious vision for transforming Somalia from a sick state into one of the leaders of the Horn of Africa, itself a region of instability.</p>
        <p>Mr. Salad's critics point to his long career in the Siad Barre regime, which he served for the better part of 20 years in top posts, including minister of the interior. Saying he had committed no crimes, Mr. Salad contended that Somalis understand that his generation is the last with actual experience running a government.</p>
        <p>''It's up to the people of Somalia to judge,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Today, Somalis said they were fervently behind Mr. Salad. Many paraded the streets with photocopies of a flattering portrait pasted to signboards. Children waving branches chanted: ''Who is the winner? Abdikassim!''</p>
        <p>''We are very happy,'' said Okash Sugow Muhammad, 29, holding a flower in front of a truck filling with people waiting to see Mr. Salad at the stadium.</p>
        <p>Mr. Salad plans to stay in Somalia until Saturday, before leaving for Egypt to meet with the Arab League, then to New York to visit the United Nations.</p>
