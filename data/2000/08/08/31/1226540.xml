        <p>Return Engagement</p>

        <p>Art of Irreverence</p>
        <p>Poking fun at politics is nothing new. Pegged to the first United States presidential election year of the third millennium, the exhibition opening tomorrow at the Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven traces the evolution of political caricature from the 16th century to modern times. In the beginning were the allegorical prints based on designs by Pieter Bruegel the Elder and Titian. Political caricature became a full-fledged genre in 18th-century England, and the exhibition includes works by Hogarth, James Gillray and Isaac Cruikshank from the golden age of English caricature. Other artists in ''The Body Politic: The Evolution of Political Satire in Print,'' which continues through Nov. 26, include Goya, Daumier, Thomas Nast, Red Grooms and Warhol.</p>
        <p>Road Trips</p>
        <p>Don't look for the San Francisco Symphony and the Dallas Symphony Orchestra in their usual haunts in the days to come. Joined by the pianists Martha Argerich and Helene Grimaud, Michael Tilson Thomas and the San Franciscans left yesterdayfor a 13-concert, 11-city European tour through Sept. 13. The Dallas Symphony, led by Andrew Litton, leaves on Saturday on a 10-concert European tour through Sept. 16.</p>
        <p>Star Power</p>
        <p>When it comes to making movies and attracting audiences, India brooks little competition. Its film industry, popularly known as Bollywood, cranks out some 800 films a year and attracts an audience of hundreds of millions. At 8 on Saturday night six Bollywood stars, including Sanjay Dutt and Sushmita Sen, are to appear at the Nassau Coliseum in a musical extravaganza, ''Wanted Alive.''</p>
