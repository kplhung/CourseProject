        <p>Parent of a kidnapped child asks Internal Revenue Service whether child qualifies for a deduction on income tax return, and IRS says it does, but only for the year in which child was abducted; tax experts generally agree with IRS lawyers' interpretation of the law, but some predict that Congress will do something to extend the deduction before the election; only 24 percent of abductions are the work of strangers, the rest being committed by relatives or friends (L)</p>

        <p>The taxpayer's question started out poignant, then turned pragmatic: My child has been kidnapped. Can I still take a deduction on my income tax return? The answer this week from an Internal Revenue Service lawyer was matter of fact: only for the year the child was abducted.</p>
        <p>The taxpayer asked an I.R.S. customer service representative in April about the exemption for the 1999 tax year. The taxpayer also asked if the exemption could be claimed in future years if the child's room was being maintained and money was spent on a search.</p>

        <p>The taxpayer's question started out poignant, then turned pragmatic: My child has been kidnapped. Can I still take a deduction on my income tax return? The answer this week from an Internal Revenue Service lawyer was matter of fact: only for the year the child was abducted.</p>
        <p>The taxpayer asked an I.R.S. customer service representative in April about the exemption for the 1999 tax year. The taxpayer also asked if the exemption could be claimed in future years if the child's room was being maintained and money was spent on a search.</p>
        <p>In a reply that the agency released Monday, George Baker, an I.R.S. lawyer, said that in the year of the kidnapping, Congress allows the tax break. But in subsequent years no exemption can be claimed, he wrote, because the tax law generally requires a parent to provide more than half the support for a child to qualify. The I.R.S. did not identify the questioner, saying tax matters were private.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baker's advisory opinion acknowledged that ''the issue is not free from doubt''; the lawyer said he could not find a case that addressed these issues directly. But he relied heavily on a 1980 United States Tax Court case in which Ebrahim Otmishi sought an exemption for a child, Jeiran, who had been abducted by Mr. Otmishi's wife, Mina -- or, alternatively, to deduct the costs of hunting for his child as a theft loss. The court ruled against him.</p>
        <p>Several tax experts said yesterday that they agreed with the lawyer's advisory opinion -- though not all were confident how long it would stand. ''Now I expect we will see Republicans and Democrats racing each other to show how much they care about kidnapped children by fixing the law before the elections,'' said Lee Sheppard, a tax lawyer known for her acerbic critiques of tax policy in the journal Tax Notes.</p>
        <p>Many missing children, experts say, have been taken by a parent denied custody in a divorce. A study by the National Center for Juvenile Justice, a private research group in Pittsburgh, found that 24 percent of abductions were by strangers and the rest by relatives or friends.</p>
        <p>Even so, a parent holding a child in such circumstances probably would not qualify for a tax deduction -- and a kidnapper who was a stranger certainly would not -- under a 1958 law in which Congress denied dependent exemptions when ''the relationship between such individual and the taxpayer is in violation of local law.''</p>
        <p>Jonathan Barry Forman, a University of Oklahoma law professor who specializes in family tax matters, said he was surprised at the I.R.S. position.</p>
        <p>He pointed to an I.R.S. regulation that lets the parents of a newborn who remains hospitalized list the child as a dependent on the theory that, but for the medical condition, the child would be part of the household. By applying the same reasoning, the I.R.S. could let parents of abducted children claim the deduction, Professor Forman said.</p>
        <p>The I.R.S. legal memo is consistent with the agency's actions in the case of 12-year-old Johnny Gosch, who was kidnapped by a stranger in front of five witnesses in Des Moines in 1982. His mother, Noreen Gosch, said the family's tax return was audited in 1986 and the exemption claimed for Johnny was denied.</p>
        <p>''The I.R.S. agent was very cruel,'' Mrs. Gosch said. ''She said, 'Your son chose to not live at home so you can't get an exemption for him,' and we reminded her that he was taken from us. And she said that was beside the point -- that if he wasn't living with us we could not get an exemption for him.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Gosch and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children appealed to a variety of officials, but the auditor's decision stood, she said. Johnny has never been found.</p>
        <p>Taxpayers claiming an exemption for a child must list the child's Social Security number on their tax return. In 1999, taxpayers could deduct $2,750 from their adjusted gross income for each dependent.</p>
        <p>The I.R.S. has a system to check its records for the addresses of parents suspected of kidnapping their own child and to release information to law enforcement. Ransom paid to recover an abducted child is deductible, the I.R.S. ruled in 1972. It said such payments were treated as theft losses due to extortion.</p>
