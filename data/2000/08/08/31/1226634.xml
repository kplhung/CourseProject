        <p>Derek Bell lifted himself slowly off a black couch in the Mets' clubhouse yesterday to change the channel after his beloved ''Judge Judy'' had ended. Bell cringed as he put weight on his left leg and hobbled to the television and then back to the couch in obvious pain.</p>
        <p>Bell, who has a bruised left knee and a strained groin, did not start last night's game against the Houston Astros and he conceded that he could miss several games. While the Mets said hopefully that Bell might be able to play right field against the St. Louis Cardinals tomorrow, Bell indicated that returning by the middle of next week is ''a better goal.''</p>
        <p>''When I come back, I've got to make sure I'm ready for the stretch run,'' Bell said. ''I don't want to come back early and miss two or three weeks.''</p>
        <p>While Bell spent most of his afternoon on the couch, reliever John Franco tested his sore left pectoral muscle by throwing about 20 pitches off a mound. Franco still felt some discomfort so he will rest today, then throw off the mound again tomorrow and try to pitch in a game over the weekend.</p>
        <p>''I still felt something, but it's bearable to where I can pitch,'' Franco said. ''It's improved, but it's not as fast as I'd like it to improve. Who knows? It might not improve any more.''</p>
        <p>General Manager Steve Phillips said Franco felt ''pretty good'' and focused on how Franco did not feel worse than he felt while throwing Monday on flat ground, but the Mets would surely be concerned if the pain continued. The left-handed Franco has been a critical component to a deep and sound bullpen and has not allowed an earned run in his last 23 outings, stretching to June 24.</p>
        <p>''If it's to a point where I hurt, I won't pitch,'' Franco said.</p>
        <p>Manager Bobby Valentine said that Al Leiter, who left Tuesday's 11-1 loss to the Astros after only three innings because of a strained muscle in his backside, felt good yesterday and was not expected to miss a start.</p>
        <p>Leiter was unavailable to comment because he was given permission to return home to Weston, Fla., before today's off day and will meet the team in St. Louis tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Since Bell will be unavailable, the Mets recalled the 23-year-old outfielder Timoniel Perez from Class AAA Norfolk and optioned reliever Jerrod Riggan to Class AA Binghamton.</p>
        <p>Perez was batting .357 with 6 homers, 37 runs batted in and 13 stolen bases in 72 games, causing Phillips to admit, ''We didn't expect him to put up those kind of numbers at Triple A.''</p>
        <p>The loss of Bell, who has been slumping with 7 hits in his last 64 at-bats, is still worrisome because he has been a stable defensive player and can be a catalyst when he is hitting. Bell injured himself when he slammed his knee against the padded wall along the right-field line while pursuing a foul ball in Tuesday's game.</p>
        <p>The Mets did not realize that Bell had also injured his groin until yesterday, and Bell said what scared him was the delicate nature of groin injuries.</p>
        <p>''The knee feels sore, but the groin hurts,'' Bell said. ''When I lay on my side, it's really painful. When I went to sleep, it was real painful.''</p>
        <p>For the second time this week, the Mets recalled a player from Class AAA but also had a player driving from Class AA Binghamton because of plane trouble in Norfolk, Va. But Alex Escobar, who was driving from Binghamton, N.Y., was not as lucky as Riggan, who spent two days in the majors when Eric Cammack could not get to New York from Virginia. Perez made it to Shea Stadium by 6:30 last night. The Mets reached Escobar and told him to turn around.</p>
        <p>Perez, who played 12 games for Hiroshima in Japan last year, was signed as a minor league free agent on March 17 and hit .355 for Class A St. Lucie before he was promoted to Norfolk on June 5. Phillips described Perez as someone who can play three outfield positions, who possesses power to the outfield gaps and who can bunt for a hit. The addition of Perez put the Mets' 40-man roster at 40.</p>
